<text>Final Destination 2 is a 2003 American supernatural horror film directed by David R. Ellis. The screenplay was written by J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, based on a story by Gruber, Bress, and series creator Jeffrey Reddick. It is the sequel to the 2000 film &quot;Final Destination&quot; and the second installment of the &quot;Final Destination&quot; film series. The film stars Ali Larter, A. J. Cook, and Michael Landes. Cook portrays a woman who &quot;cheats death&quot; after having a premonition of herself and others perishing in a highway pile-up and uses it by saving herself and a handful of people, but is stalked by Death afterwards by means of claiming back their lives which should have been lost in the highway. It also explores the cliffhanger of the preceding film by revealing the fates of the previous survivors.

After the financial success of &quot;Final Destination&quot;, New Line Cinema contacted Reddick regarding plans for a sequel. Since the original film&#x27;s crew was unavailable, New Line replaced most of the production team. Filming took place in Vancouver and Okanagan Lake. &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; was released on January 31, 2003, and on DVD on July 22, 2003, which includes commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries, and videos.

The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $46million domestically and $43million overseas, earning $90million internationally. It was also nominated for four awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. A third film, &quot;Final Destination 3&quot;, was released in February 2006.

==Plot==

One year after the explosion of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman. While waiting on the entrance ramp to U.S. Route 23, she has a of a deadly pile-up caused by a logging truck. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis, mother Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim, businesswoman Kat Jennings, stoner Rory Peters, pregnant Isabella Hudson, high school teacher Eugene Dix, and state trooper Thomas Burke. While Burke questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs, but Shaina, Dano, and Frankie are killed by a car carrier after Burke saves Kimberly at the last second.

After the survivors are questioned at the police station, Evan is fatally impaled by a fire escape ladder while attempting to escape from a fire in his apartment. Aware of Death&#x27;s presence, Kimberly seeks help from Clear Rivers, the last survivor of Flight 180 who committed herself to a psychiatric ward for protection after Alex Browning was killed by a falling brick.

When Kimberly informs Clear that Evan was the first of the highway survivors to die, unlike in her premonition, Clear realizes that the survivors are dying in reverse order. Meanwhile, Tim is crushed by a windowpane while leaving the dentist with his mother. Clear decides to help and introduces Kimberly and Burke to William Bludworth, who tells them that only new life can defeat Death. Believing that the birth of Isabella&#x27;s baby would disrupt Death&#x27;s plan, Burke sends fellow marshal Steve Adams to take her into custody while he gathers the other survivors in his apartment. When Nora decides to leave, a chain of accidents results in her head becoming trapped in the doors of an elevator, decapitating her.

The survivors take Kat&#x27;s SUV to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor, prompting Adams to rush her to the hospital. Along the way, the survivors realize that the demises of the Flight 180 survivors affected all of their lives even before the highway pile-up by saving them from prior deaths, which inverted the sequence of the concurring accident. The SUV then suffers a blowout, causing them to swerve into a stack of PVC pipes in a farm that penetrate the car. Though no one is killed immediately, Eugene is injured and Kat is left pinned to her seat by a log. Rescue workers arrive and assist the farm owners, the Gibbons family, with rescuing the others while Eugene is hospitalized. Using the jaws of life, Kat&#x27;s rescuer accidentally activates her airbag, causing her head to be impaled on a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls onto a gasoline leak from a news van that explodes, launching a barbed wire fence into the air that dismembers Rory.

Guided by a vision of a doctor named Kalarjian who Kimberly believes will euthanize Isabella; she, Clear, and Burke rush to a hospital to save her but while Isabella and her baby are safe, Kimberly sees through her premonition that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile-up at all. At the same time, an explosion from an oxygen leak in Eugene&#x27;s ward kills both him and Clear. Kimberly realizes that the vision from the hospital was hers, deducing from an article of a survivor creating &quot;new life&quot; to defeat Death. To ensure Burke&#x27;s safety, she drives into a lake to drown herself, but Burke saves her and she is revived by Dr. Kalarjian.

Later, Kimberly and Burke have a picnic with the Gibbons and Kimberly&#x27;s father. The Gibbons explain that their son Brian was nearly hit by a news van on the day of the accident, but Rory saved him. As Kimberly and Burke realize the implications, Brian is suddenly killed in an explosion caused by a malfunctioning barbecue grill.

==Production==
===Development===
The first film, &quot;Final Destination&quot;, was conceived by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from &quot;Flight 180&quot;, a spec script intended for use in &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film&#x27;s success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he &quot;wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.&quot; Wong and Morgan were not available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects &quot;The One&quot; and &quot;Willard&quot;. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers.

&quot;Second unit is like an extension of directing, you&#x27;re doing big action sequences on film and it was just something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, it was kind of a natural transition,&quot; Ellis professed. &quot;I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched &quot;Final Destination&quot; to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it,&quot; Ellis added. &quot;We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, &#x27;How can we make Death just a total badass?&#x27; and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!&quot; Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film, with Perry stating, &quot;We could have made no other movies and the first one still would have been a satisfying experience. But when we were given the opportunity to make a sequel, we jumped at it.&quot;

===Casting===
One of the prior film&#x27;s main characters, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed off-screen in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved the issue with the statement that &quot;it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon&#x27;s unwillingness to come back.&quot; Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. &quot;When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific,&quot; Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear &quot;[has] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can&#x27;t get her.&quot; Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. &quot;It&#x27;s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved,&quot; Ellis expressed.

The role of Kimberly Corman was given to Canadian actress A. J. Cook, who previously starred in the 1999 film &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. Cook described her role as &quot;a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, right in front of her eyes, so she had to grow up quick.&quot; Ellis described her role as &quot;a girl who can have some fun cause they&#x27;re going on a trip and they&#x27;re gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear.&quot; Cook added that &quot;it&#x27;s rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [Larter].&quot; Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. &quot;[We] were at the beginning of what&#x27;s going to be a long successful career for her,&quot; Perry cited.

Michael Landes, who appeared in the TV series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, was cast as Thomas Burke. Landes defined him as &quot;a real nice, decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [and] who is very intrigued to begin with&quot; and as &quot;the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector.&quot; Ellis pointed out that he &quot;just wanted to find someone who&#x27;s young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn&#x27;t an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [Landes] brought this really good balance to his part.&quot; Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.

Former &quot;Living Single&quot; star Terrence C. Carson was hired as Eugene Dix. Carson identified his role as &quot;a very by-the-book type of person but soon has a change of heart as the corpses begin to pile up.&quot; The crew was enticed of Carson&#x27;s casting, with Bress mentioning how his &quot;originally envisioned Woody Allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. It&#x27;s got ten times the personality, this charisma that T.C. brings to it...he&#x27;s just such a great presence.&quot; Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson &quot;can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice.&quot; Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film &quot;House of the Dead&quot;, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as &quot;a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, &#x27;I don&#x27;t really care at all&#x27;, to &#x27;Oh my God, this is really happening!&#x27;&quot;

In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since &quot;he&#x27;s great comic relief, he&#x27;s got a drug problem, he&#x27;s funny, and he&#x27;s all that.&quot; Bress bragged that &quot;Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he&#x27;s just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It&#x27;s like &#x27;Oh yeah. That&#x27;s good! That&#x27;s better!&#x27;&quot; &quot;What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he&#x27;s involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you&#x27;re really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he&#x27;s the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there&#x27;s a place that humor comes from that we all share,&quot; Perry appended.

&quot;Blackwoods&quot; actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings. Tracy claimed that &quot;[Kat] doesn&#x27;t really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical attitude can&#x27;t ignore the truth of the situation they&#x27;re all in.&quot; Perry defined the role as &quot;someone who is really so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her.&quot; Her casting was assessed by Perry as &quot;full of energy&quot; and &quot;embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [Tracy] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don&#x27;t dislike so much that you don&#x27;t understand why she is the way she is.&quot; Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd (Rachel Todd in &quot;You, Me and the Kids&quot;) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk (Kyle Morgan in &quot;Once Upon a Christmas&quot;) as her son Tim Carpenter, David Paetkau (Hunter Kerrigan in &quot;Just Deal&quot;) as gambler Evan Lewis, Justina Machado (Vanessa Diaz in &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;) as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and Noel Fisher (Todd Tolanski of &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;) as farmer Brian Gibbons. Novice actors Sarah Carter, Alejandro Rae, and Shaun Sipos were hired as Kimberly&#x27;s friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman correspondingly. Andrew Airlie portrayed Kimberly&#x27;s father Michael Corman, while Enid-Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian.

=== Filming ===

Like the first film, the film was shot in and around Vancouver Island in 2002. &quot;We know the area, we know the people up there and let&#x27;s be honest, there&#x27;s an enormous economic incentive to shoot there. We were very fortunate to get [unit production manager] Justis Greene, who&#x27;s been working as a line producer up there for 30 years and who was able to get us the best crew working in town right now. It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie,&quot; Perry stated as the reason for the film&#x27;s production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim&#x27;s death.

The farm and lake scenes were filmed in Campbell River and Okanagan Lake respectively, though it is depicted in Greenwood Lake, New York. &quot;We shot part of it at the lake where it was 37° cold, which is beyond an ice cream headache. And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93° pool,&quot; Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. &quot;My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. So it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that,&quot; Cook divulged. &quot;We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator,&quot; Landes enunciated.

To avoid confusion with Larter and Carter, Cook was required to dye her hair brown for the role. &quot;I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don&#x27;t get typecast,&quot; Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly&#x27;s relationship. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn&#x27;t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn&#x27;t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, is a little bit of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there&#x27;s no real love story,&quot; Landes articulated.

=== Effects ===
Digital Dimension took charge of the visual effects of the film. CG supervisor Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. &quot;They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG,&quot; Crosby indicated. &quot;It began with R&amp;D on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the &#x27;jumping through windshields killer instinct&#x27; we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role.&quot;

Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also used for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.

In spite of this, there are no CG cars incorporated in the actual film. &quot;It was a possibility in the beginning so we did some dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body deformers on them, but when they were done shooting they didn&#x27;t end up needing any CG cars,&quot; Crosby avowed. Lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting. Landes experienced claustrophobia during the procedure. Fake blood was also used, but CG blood was also shown.

===Music===

====Soundtrack====
Like its predecessor, no official album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs featured in the film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of the Sounds, &quot;Dance with Me&quot; and &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, were promoted on Kimberly&#x27;s car stereo. Besides these, the music video of &quot;Seven Days a Week&quot; accompanied the film&#x27;s DVD. &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; by the Blank Theory was both heard on Evan&#x27;s car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed &quot;My Name is Death&quot; during Brian&#x27;s death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; by AC/DC (on Kimberly&#x27;s car AV), &quot;Jon F. Hennessy&quot; by FT (on Rory&#x27;s vehicle audio), &quot;Vitamin&quot; by Incubus (during Evan&#x27;s house fire) and &quot;I Got You&quot; by (hed) Planet Earth (during Rory&#x27;s party).

====Score====

Final Destination 2: Original Motion Picture Score was the promotional film score conducted by Daytime Emmy-winning composer Shirley Walker. Though it was not officially released, it was made available alongside &quot;Willard: The Original Motion Picture Score&quot; on September 30, 2003.

The score received positive reviews among commentators. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; applauded that &quot;Shirley Walker&#x27;s score displays a thorough understanding of horror jolts.&quot; Pete Roberts of &quot;DVDActive&quot; admired the score as &quot;top notch.&quot; Anthony Horan of &quot;DVD.net Australia&quot; told readers to &quot;crank up the volume and prepare for a sonic feast&quot;. Nonetheless, Chris Carle of &quot;IGN Movies&quot; noted that &quot;while the score is nothing you&#x27;ll remember, it gets the job done.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 50% of 111 critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 5 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;This sequel is little more than an excuse to stage elaborate, gory scenes of characters getting killed off.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. In 2010, Nick Hyman of &quot;Metacritic&quot; included &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; in the website&#x27;s editorial &quot;15 Movies the Critics Got Wrong&quot;, denoting that &quot;the elaborate suspense/action set pieces from the first two films are more impressive than most&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B+ on an A+ to F scale.

Negative evaluations condemned the film&#x27;s plot, acting, and screenplay. Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that &quot;perhaps movies are like history, and repeat themselves, first as tragedy, then as farce&quot;. James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; stressed that &quot;the movie mandates complete gullibility and vacuous attention in order to work on any level&quot;. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; complained that &quot;there is an audience for a movie in which innocent people suffer hideous accidental deaths is troubling enough, but a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle [which] simply provokes disgust&quot;. Justine Elias of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; asserted that &quot;this risible thriller is merely a sadistic series of misread premonitions and vile murders&quot;. David Grove of &quot;Film Threat&quot; stated that &quot;[he] wasn&#x27;t much scared by anything in &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; which is silly and illogical&quot;. Jeff Vice of &quot;Deseret News&quot; censured to &quot;not even get into the awful script or the numbingly awful performances&quot;, while Bruce Fretts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated &quot;everything else about the film is also deadly&quot;.

Some critics praised the film&#x27;s comedic theme. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; imparted &quot;it&#x27;s not as cheekily knowing as the &quot;Scream movies&quot; or as trashily Grand Guignol as the &quot;Evil Dead franchise&quot;, but like those pictures it recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter, and dispenses both with a free, unpretentious hand&quot;. C. W. Nevius of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; conveyed its &quot;funnier than the original&quot;. Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; pronounced &quot;if this is your idea of fun, step right up&quot;. William Arnold of &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; found it as &quot;a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs&quot;. Marc Savlov of &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; admired how &quot;it is surprisingly good fun for the current crop of horror films, reasonably well-plotted and full of jaw-dropping, white-knuckle scares. That said, it&#x27;s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended.&quot; Nev Pierce of &quot;BBC&quot; saw that &quot;it&#x27;s simple, but effective&quot;, whereas Sheila Norman-Culp of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; proclaimed that &quot;what &quot;Final Destination&quot; did for the fear of flying, &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; does for the fear of driving&quot;.

Amongst the cast ensemble, Carson, Cherry, Cook, Landes, Larter, and Todd were prominent amidst the analysis for their performances as Eugene, Rory, Kimberly, Thomas, Clear, and Bludworth respectively. Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;Carson as skeptical Eugene energizes what had been a rote conception on the page&quot;; &quot;Cherry offered some dry comic balance&quot;; Larter was &quot;casted little light&quot;; Todd was squandered by his &quot;single, distinctly flat scene&quot;; and &quot;the generally awful thesping, led by Cook, whose blurry grasp of emotions betrays Ellis&#x27; apparent disinterest in his actors&quot;. Grove of &quot;Film Threat&quot; panned Cook, uttering that &quot;she&#x27;s no great actress, but she&#x27;s a real looker&quot; and teased that &quot;since when did a horror movie suffer from having two dumb blondes as leads&quot;, the other actress being Larter, who &quot;spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting&quot;. Dustin Putman of &quot;TheMovieBoy.com&quot; commented how &quot;Cook is serviceable as the premonition-fueled Kimberly, but doesn&#x27;t evoke enough emotion in the scenes following the brutal deaths of her close friends.&quot; Robin Clifford of &quot;Reeling Reviews&quot; stated that &quot;Cook was strident as the catalyst that sparks events with her premonitions of disaster and her fervent desire to cheat the Reaper&quot; whereas Larter was &quot;giving the smart-ass edge her character needs&quot;, while Brett Gallman of &quot;Oh, The Horror!&quot; claimed that Larter &quot;is again the bright spot&quot;, along with Cook and Landes who were &quot;serviceable as leads&quot; and Todd &quot;whose purpose has still yet to be revealed in the franchise&quot;.

In January 2022, Stephen Rosenberg of MovieWeb ranked the franchise&#x27;s films from worst to best. Rosenberg highlighted &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; as the best installment of the franchise, citing the opening sequence as, &quot;memorable in the entire horror genre, let alone the franchise&quot; and praised Todd&#x27;s performance.

===Accolades===
Like its predecessor, the film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film in 2004, as well as Choice Movie - Horror/Thriller in the 2003 Teen Choice Awards; likewise, the awards lost to &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;The Ring&quot;, respectively. In the 4th Golden Trailer Awards, it was voted for the Golden Fleece, but lost to the surfer film &quot;Blue Crush&quot;. Furthermore, the &quot;Collision on Highway 23&quot; was nominated for Best Action Sequence at the MTV Movie Awards in 2003, but lost it to the &quot;Battle for Helm&#x27;s Deep&quot; of the fantasy film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, another New Line film.

The highway scene was regarded by Grove of &quot;Film Threat&quot; as &quot;a monument to smashed cars, flying objects and scorched metal&quot; and Garth Franklin of &quot;Dark Horizons&quot; as &quot;utterly spectacular.&quot; Anne Billson of &quot;Guardian.co.uk&quot; exclaimed it as &quot;one of the most terrifying sequences I&#x27;ve ever seen, all the more effective for being grounded in reality; few drivers haven&#x27;t felt that anxious twinge as the badly secured load on the lorry in front of them starts to wobble.&quot;
The Route 23 pile-up scene was number 1 in the lists of best car crashes or disaster scenes by &quot;Screen Junkies&quot;, &quot;Made Man&quot;, &quot;Unreality Magazine&quot;, &quot;All Left Turns&quot;, &quot;Chillopedia&quot;, &quot;Filmstalker&quot;, &quot;io9&quot;, &quot;UGO Entertainment&quot;, &quot;Filmcritic.com&quot;, and &quot;New York Magazine&quot;. &quot;Filmsite&quot; enlisted all fatalities in its &quot;Best Film Deaths Scenes&quot;. The demise of Kirk&#x27;s character entered these listings of the most shocking deaths on film: George Wales of &quot;Total Film&quot; (#28), James Eldred of &quot;Bullz-Eye.com&quot; (#20), and Jeff Otto of &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot; (#9).

<text>The Queen Alexandra Range () is a major mountain range about long, bordering the entire western side of Beardmore Glacier from the Polar Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf.
The range is in the Transantarctic Mountains System, and is located in the Ross Dependency region of Antarctica.
==Discovery==
The Queen Alexandra Range was discovered on the journey toward the South Pole by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09 (BrAE), and was named by Ernest Shackleton for Queen Alexandra, Queen of the United Kingdom, 1901-10.
Shackleton and his men, and a later expedition headed by Robert Falcon Scott, both collected rock samples from the range that contained fossils. The discovery that multicellular life forms had lived so close to the South Pole was an additional piece of evidence that accompanied the publication (in 1910 and independently in 1912) of the theory of continental drift.

==Location==
The Queen Alexandra Range is bounded by the Beardmore Glacier along its southeast edge, which divides it from the Commonwealth Range of the Queen Maud Mountains to the east. 
The west of the range is bounded by the Antarctic Plateau in the south.
Further north it is bounded by the Walcott Névé to the east, which separates the range from the Colbert Hills. 
The Walcott Névé joins the Law Glacier in the Bowden Névé which feeds the Lennox-King Glacier.
This glacier bounds the northwest part of the range, and separates it from the Holland Range to the north.
The northern tip of the range extends to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Lennox King Glaciers and Beardmore Glacier.

==Major glaciers==
*Beardmore Glacier () is of the largest known valley glaciers, over long, descending the polar plateau and flowing north between the Queen Alexandra Range and Commonwealth Range, to enter the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Law Glacier () is a glacier about wide between the south end of the Queen Elizabeth Range and the MacAlpine Hills, gradually descending east-northeast from the polar plateau to Bowden Névé.
*Bowden Névé is a névé about wide, lying southward of Mount Miller between Queen Elizabeth Range and Queen Alexandra Range.

<text>The Alexandra Mountains () are a group of low, separated mountains in the north portion of Edward VII Peninsula, just southwest of Sulzberger Bay in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica.

==Discovery and name==
The Alexandra Mountains were discovered in January–February 1902 by the British National Antarctic Expedition (BrNAE) during an exploratory cruise of the &quot;Discovery&quot; along the Ross Ice Shelf. 
They were named for Alexandra of Denmark, then Queen of the United Kingdom.

==Location==
The Alexandra Mountains are on the north side of the Edward VII Peninsula, to the north of the Rockefeller Mountains.
They lie on both sides of the Butler Glacier, which flows from west to east, then turns north to enter Sulzberger Bay.
Other glaciers include Cumbie Glacier, flowing from Mount Youngman, Larson Glacier, which feeds Butler Glacier, Dalton Glacier to the west and Blades Glacier to the south.
Northern features, from northwest to southeast, include Scott Nunataks, Mount Youngman, Sneddon Nunataks and Mount Swadener. 
Southern features include Clark Peak, La Gorce Peak, Bowman Peak, Mount Manger and Mount Josephine.

==Northern features==
===Scott Nunataks===
Conspicuous twin elevations which form the north end of the Alexandra Mountains on Edward VII Peninsula. 
Discovered in 1902 by the BrNAE under Captain Robert Falcon Scott, Royal Navy. 
Named after Scott by Lieutenant K. Prestrud, leader of the Eastern Sledge Party of Amundsen&#x27;s Norwegian expedition who ascended the features while exploring Edward VII Peninsula in 1911.

===Mount Youngman===
A snow-covered coastal mountain high, southeast of Scott Nunataks. 
It stands at the head of Cumbie Glacier and overlooks Swinburne Ice Shelf and Sulzberger Bay which are just northward. 
Mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1964–66. 
Named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Captain Samuel A. Youngman, United States Navy, medical officer on the staff of the Commander, United States Naval Support Force, Antarctica, during Operation Deep Freeze 1969 and 1970.

===Sneddon Nunataks===
A group of coastal nunataks on the north side of Edward VII Peninsula which overlooks the Swinburne Ice Shelf and Sulzberger Bay.
They stand east-southeast of Scott Nunataks in the north part of Alexandra Mountains. 
The nunataks appear on the map of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition (ByrdAE), 1928–30. 
Named by US-ACAN for Donald L. Sneddon, United States Navy, electronics technician with the Byrd Station winter party in 1967.

===Mount Swadener===
A peak in the Sneddon Nunataks, in the north portion of the Alexandra Mountains. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1959–66. 
Named by US-ACAN for Lieutenant John R. Swadener, United States Navy, navigator of the ski-equipped R4D in which R. Admiral George Dufek made the first aircraft landing at the geographic South Pole, on October 31, 1956.

==Southern features==
===Clark Peak===
A rock peak high surmounting a bluff on the west side of Larson Glacier in northern Edward VII Peninsula. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy aerial photographs, 1964–67.
Named by US-ACAN for Leroy Clark, member of the winter party of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1933–35.

===La Gorce Peak===
Prominent summit southwest of Mount Josephine, standing at the south end and marking the highest peak in the Alexandra Mountains. 
Discovered in February 1929 by the ByrdAE, and named by Byrd for John Oliver La Gorce.

===Balsley Peak===

A distinctive peak, about high, located southeast of LaGorce Peak. 
Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2004) after James R. Balsley, U.S. Geological Survey, who conducted airborne magnetometer near this peak during United States Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47.
Later he was Chief, Branch of Geophysics, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

===Bowman Peak===
Peak on the south side of Butler Glacier, in the Alexandra Mountains. 
Discovered by the ByrdAE in 1929 and named for John McEntee Bowman, president of the Bowman Biltmore Hotels Corporation, who donated headquarters for the preparation of the expedition.

===Mount Manger===
A snow-covered mountain located northwest of Mount Josephine. 
The mountain was photographed from the air and roughly mapped by the ByrdAE, 1928–30. 
Named by US-ACAN (at the suggestion of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd) for William Manger, of the family that owned the Manger Hotel chain, who assisted Byrd expeditions by providing free room for office space and for expedition personnel.

===Mount Josephine===
Peak marked by prominent rock outcrops, southeast of Bowman Peak. 
Discovered by Rear Admiral Byrd while on the ByrdAE Eastern Flight of December 5, 1929, and named by him during the ByrdAE (1933–35) for Josephine Clay Ford, daughter of Edsel Ford, contributor to both expeditions.

<text>The Martin XB-33 Super Marauder was a proposed World War II American bomber aircraft. It was designed by the Glenn L. Martin Company as the Martin Model 190 and was a high-altitude derivative of the company&#x27;s B-26 Marauder. Two different designs were developed, first as a twin-engined aircraft and then as a four-engined aircraft. The four-engined version was ordered by the United States Army Air Forces, but the program was cancelled before any aircraft were built.

==Design and development==

===XB-33===
The first version of the B-33 design, the XB-33, was a twin-tailed medium bomber with two Wright R-3350 engines and pressurised crew compartments; its design began in 1940. It would carry around 4,000 lb (1,814 kg) of bombs. Soon after design of the XB-33 began it became clear that a twin-engined aircraft would not achieve the performance requested by the army. The company moved on to developing a larger four-engined design, the XB-33A.

===XB-33A===
Following the abandonment of the original twin-engined design, the company continued to design a larger four-engined aircraft, and two prototypes were ordered by the USAAF as the XB-33A; its bombload was to have been 12,000 lb (5,443 kg), as much as that of the B-24 Liberator, the heaviest US bomber flown in combat prior to the B-29.

The original XB-33 design was to have been powered by the R-3350, the redesigned XB-33A was to have used Wright R-2600 engines. The main reason for this was the demand for R-3350s for the B-29, one of the most highly valued projects of the Army Air Forces.

On January 17, 1942, the USAAF placed an order for 400 B-33As, to be built at the government-owned plant in Omaha, Nebraska, operated by Martin. On November 25, 1942, the project was cancelled to allow the Omaha plant to concentrate on manufacturing B-29s.

==Variants==
;XB-33
:Prototype medium bomber powered by two 1,800 hp (1,343 kW) R-3350 engines, two ordered and cancelled.
;XB-33A
:Prototype medium bomber powered by four 1,800 hp (1,343 kW) R-2600-15 engines, two ordered and cancelled.
;B-33A Super Marauder
:Production variant of XB-33A, 400 ordered and cancelled.

<text>The National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS) is an Australian fingerprint and palm print database and matching system to assist law enforcement agencies across Australia and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to establish the identity of persons and to help solve crimes and for other purposes.

NAFIS was established in 1986, and an upgraded system commenced operations in April 2001 and provides technological improvements in fingerprint matching.
It has shown to be very reliable in fingerprint matching.

<text>Tasman Empire Airways Limited (1940–1965), better known by its acronym TEAL, is the former name of Air New Zealand.

TEAL was formed by the Intergovernmental Agreement for Tasman Sea Air Services (also known as the Tasman Sea Agreement), which is a treaty signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand in London on 10 April 1940. TEAL was first registered in Wellington as a limited liability company on 26 April 1940. The company&#x27;s purpose was originally to transport mail, passengers, and cargo across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, during World War II. The treaty was originally intended to end within three months after hostilities with Germany ended, but it was extended in 1949 and ultimately ended on 31 March 1954, with control and ownership passing into normal commercial arrangements.

Shares in the company were originally held by the New Zealand Government (20%), Union Airways (19%), BOAC (38%) and Qantas (23%). After World War II shareholding passed to equal ownership by New Zealand and Australian Government . Four Short Sandringham aircraft and Short Solent aircraft were acquired, as well as an ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force Consolidated PBY Catalina for survey flights.

==Routes and services==
===Tasman Service===
==== Auckland–Sydney ====
The inaugural Tasman service between Auckland&#x27;s Mechanics Bay airport and Sydney&#x27;s Rose Bay Water Airport on 30 April 1940 was flown by &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, one of its two Short S.30 flying boats. There was a connection at Sydney with the Qantas/BOAC Empire Air Route or Empire Air Mail Scheme to England which meant that there was, for the first time, a regular through-air service between New Zealand and England. That lasted less than six weeks, for it was no longer possible to fly through the Mediterranean when Italy entered World War II in June 1940. The Horseshoe route, between Sydney and Durban, South Africa (via Singapore, Calcutta, and Cairo) provided a solution.

The first four months of operation saw a weekly return service between Auckland and Sydney. This was expanded to thrice fortnightly with connections to San Francisco using Pan Am flights from Auckland (Pan Am was not flying into Australia). The connection to San Francisco ended in December 1941 when Japan entered the war.

In the first year, the annual report revealed that 130 trans-Tasman flights had been completed carrying 1,461 passengers for a profit, prior to tax and dividends, of NZ£31,479. By 1944, the trans-Tasman frequency had increased to three weekly return flights.

==== Wellington–Sydney ====
From 1940–1950, TEAL operated a single Tasman service, between Auckland and Sydney, with Short flying boats. From 1950 to 1954, Wellington was also linked by flying boat to Sydney. The intended Wellington–Sydney flying boat service commenced on 3 October 1950 with the departure of TEAL Short Solent IV, RMA &quot;Ararangi&quot;, from Wellington. It carried between 40,000 and 50,000 letters, mostly first-day covers, weighing 660 lbs and 86 lbs of second-class mail.

Wellington resumed international service, at first only to Sydney, in 1960

==== Christchurch–Melbourne ====
On 20 December 1950, 39–41 passengers on a British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Douglas DC-6 airliner chartered by TEAL, left the recently dedicated Christchurch Airport on a direct flight to Melbourne, and what would become a regular TEAL air service relieving South Island from international air-service isolation. The DC-6, RMA &quot;Resolution&quot;, departed for Melbourne at 10:10 am, arriving 6 hours and 35 minutes later.

==== Christchurch–Sydney ====
From 1954, newly acquired Douglas DC-6 aircraft were introduced to a new Christchurch–Sydney service and the Auckland–Sydney service; TEAL now operating its own Christchurch–Melbourne and Auckland–Melbourne services.

==== Auckland–Brisbane ====
A service between Auckland and Brisbane followed in 1959.

==== Christchurch–Brisbane ====
A service between Christchurch and Brisbane followed in 1959.

===Coral Route===
The New Zealand National Airways Corporation had initiated Pacific Island flights flying Douglas DC-3 aircraft, from Auckland to Nadi (Fiji), Faleolo (Samoa), Aitutaki, and Rarotonga (Cook Islands). These routes were later taken over by TEAL, which wanted to fly to Tahiti, but there was no airstrip at Papeete, so a flying boat was necessary. After completion of a survey flight by a TEAL-operated ex-RNZAF Catalina ZK-AMP in 1951, the Coral Route flight from Auckland to Papeete, Tahiti, via Laucala Bay at Suva, Fiji, Satapuala at Apia, Samoa, and Akaiamai at Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, was inaugurated by TEAL on 27 December 1951, using the Short Solent flying boats long used between Auckland and Sydney. In Samoa, the plane landed on the sea and a small motor boat operated by Fred Fairman would carry the passengers to shore. They would alight and go through customs in a small shed. The Faleolo airport was still a grass strip.

A TEAL staff competition gave the route the name the Coral Route. The winning entry came from Eric Mullane, head steward, who was inspired by the beauty of islands (coral) and of the song-filled (choral) welcome that greeted visitors to the islands. It became the only air route into Tahiti, with Americans and others from Northern Hemisphere flying by landplanes into Nadi in Fiji, making the short trip across to Suva to join the flying boat at Laucala Bay, for its fortnightly flight along the Coral Route, leaving on a Thursday morning for Samoa, alighting on the Satapuala lagoon about 2:00pm. Passengers were driven by cab through Samoan coastal villages to Apia, where they enjoyed respite and dinner at Aggie Grey&#x27;s hotel until 2:00am when they were driven back out to Satapuala for a pre-dawn take-off to the Akaiami lagoon at Aitutaki where they went ashore for breakfast and an optional swim until mid-morning takeoff for Papeete, timed to ensure that arrival was after the end of the siesta period at 2:00pm. After launching ashore and completing Customs, passengers had to wait a further hour while their luggage was sprayed against horticultural pests, a time usually spent by the majority across the road from the Customshouse at Quinn&#x27;s Bar. In all, a 30-hour leisurely introduction to life in the South Seas which made the Coral Route a legendary travel experience. 

On 15 September 1960, the final Coral Route flight by the Solent &quot;Aranui&quot; returned to Auckland. It was one of the world&#x27;s last long-range scheduled international flying boat services. Landplane flights were extended from Nadi, Fiji, to Pago Pago, American Samoa, and Papeete, Tahiti. In late 1964, the French cancelled TEAL&#x27;s licence to Tahiti and the Coral Route service was terminated at Pago Pago. Air New Zealand was permitted to return to Tahiti in 1967.

===Hibiscus Service===
In 1954, TEAL replaced its Mechanics Bay, Auckland to Suva, Fiji, flying boat service, with Douglas DC-6 landplanes from Whenuapai to Nadi. The Hibiscus Service provided first and tourist-class travel, especially appealing to folk pursuing a Pacific island dream holiday.

===Norfolk Island Service===
The New Zealand National Airways Corporation ceased air mail, passenger and cargo services to Norfolk Island in early September 1955. TEAL resumed the regular air service from Auckland in November with four-engined Douglas DC-6 &quot;Skymaster&quot; aircraft. TEAL&#x27;s service was initially weekly, then fortnightly.

==Fleet==
===Aircraft===
TEAL operated flying-boats and landplanes:

====Short S.30 Empire Class flying-boat====

The first services were flown by Short S.30 Empire Class flying boats. TEAL operated two of these between 1939 and 1947. They were given Maori spiritual names, &quot;Aotearoa&quot; (land of the long white cloud) for ZK-AMA, Serial S886, and &quot;Awarua&quot; (two rivers) for ZK-AMC, Serial S994. A third S.30 ordered by TEAL, Serial S885, was diverted to war duties in the North Atlantic and later destroyed.

The modern flying boat interior had been designed by New-Zealand-born British architect Brian O&#x27;Rorke, following the success of his interior design for the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s RMS &quot;Orion&quot; in 1935. Imperial Airways had engaged O&#x27;Rorke in the interior design, planning and detail of their new airliners and flying boats.

====Short S.25 Sandringham Mk IV Tasman Class flying-boat====

In 1946, TEAL acquired four Short S.25 Sandringham IV &#x27;Tasman Class&#x27; flying boats. They were a fully streamlined conversion passenger transport variation of the Short Sunderland. Consideration was given to landplane operations but the government delayed the decision to move to land as the UK government offered generous terms on purchasing new types in development such as the Avro Tudor and Handley Page Hermes. The Sandringhams were given generic names, ZK-AMB Serial ML761 &quot;Tasman&quot;, -AMD Serial NJ255 &quot;Australia&quot;, -AME Serial NJ179 &quot;New Zealand&quot;, and -AMH JM715 &quot;Auckland&quot;. However they were unsuited for the harsher trans Tasman crossings. They were grounded for six months in 1948 due to engine cooling issues and disposed of at the end of 1949 when a more suitable custom built version of the Short Solent became available.

====Consolidated Boeing PB2B-1 Catalina====
TEAL flew two Boeing-built Consolidated PB2B-1 Catalinas, on loan from the RNZAF, for training and survey work from 1947 to 1949. They were registered as ZK-AMI and ZK-AMP &quot;Maroro&quot; (Flying Fish – TEAL&#x27;s emblem) on the civil aviation list. ZK-AMI was never named.

====Short S.45 Solent Mk IV flying-boat====

The Short S.25 Sandringham IV was replaced by the Short S.45 Solent IV, of which TEAL acquired four—ZK-AML &quot;Aotearoa II&quot;, -AMM &quot;Ararangi&quot;, -AMN &quot;Awatere&quot; and -AMO &quot;Aranui&quot;. TEAL management were hoping to move to land based operations after the unsuccessful operation of the Sandringham. An original plan was to operate Douglas DC-4 aircraft from Auckland&#x27;s Whenuapai joint service airport alongside other overseas international operators. However, a Buy British policy and support for rebuilding the British aircraft industry forced the airline to continue operating flying boats. Proposals to fly the mammoth Saunders-Roe Princess on a subsidised trial basis, and produce a six jet engine powered flying boat, the Saunders-Roe Duchess, to add jet speed to an already antiquated mode of air transport, were also considered. A New Zealand Government promise, that the Solent would be the last water based aircraft the airline would operate, ended any thought of future flying boat development in New Zealand.
The Solents were delivered during 1949 with one setting a new trans-Tasman crossing record of 5 hours 37 minutes. With one exception, the Solents were withdrawn from service with the introduction of the Douglas DC-6 landplanes in 1954. The exception, ZK-AMO &quot;Aranui&quot;, continued flying the Coral Route from its base at Suva, Fiji, until 1960. TEAL introduced the landplane based Hibiscus Service to Nadi, Fiji.

====Short S.45 Solent Mk III flying-boat====
In 1951, TEAL purchased an extra Solent flying boat from BOAC to ease pressure on growing passenger numbers and help with the new Wellington based Tasman Service operating from Evans Bay. ZK-AMQ &quot;Aparima&quot; carried on in TEAL service until 1957, and on the Coral Route as the backup to ZK-AMO &quot;Aranui&quot; based at Suva, Fiji.

====Douglas DC-6====

The Douglas DC-6 was flown by TEAL between 1954 and 1961. Three were transferred to TEAL after the break-up of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines (BCPA). Re-registered ZK-BGA &quot;Aotearoa III&quot;, -BGB &quot;Arawhata&quot;, and -BGC &quot;Arahia&quot;. They were original &quot;short bodied&quot; types fitted out with sleeper beds and long range tanks. The aircraft started replacing the flying boats service in May 1954. It meant the transfer of TEAL&#x27;s Auckland International Airport operations from Mechanics Bay to the shared Whenuapai air force and civilian terminal, where it was to remain until 1965. In September 1956, Douglas ordered the re-skinning of all DC-6 wings. Work was completed on the fleet at Cathay Pacific&#x27;s Hong Kong engineering facilities to allow a 2000 lb increase in payload. The landplane finally allowed TEAL to expand operations to Nadi, Fiji and from there directly to Tahiti. It also opened up landplane operations to Melbourne, helping move passengers during the 1956 Olympic Games and Brisbane. It also ended the leasing of a Trans Australian Airlines DC-4 operating out of Christchurch on behalf of the airline. Wellington&#x27;s rebuilt Rongotai Airport handled its first DC-6 service just after it re-opened in 1959, ending trans-Tasman flying boat operations from nearby Evans Bay. Originally to be replaced by the Lockheed L-188 Electra in 1960, the DC-6 remained in service due to engineering issues for the Electra, until 1961. They were handed over to the Royal New Zealand Air Force to be used as troop transports, remaining in service until 1970.

====Lockheed L-188C Electra====

The last new type to be operated by TEAL was the Lockheed L.188 Electra. Five of this type were operated between 1959 and 1972 by which time TEAL had changed its name to Air New Zealand. The airline wanted to introduce jet aircraft in the form of the Comet 4 airliner but Australian shareholders insisted on the Lockheed L188 Electra, citing that Qantas, Trans Australian Airlines, Ansett ANA and Hong Kong based Cathay Pacific had ordered the type. This would lower operating costs as all the airlines would be able to share a common parts pool with the Electra.

The original three were named &quot;Aotearoa IV&quot; (ZK-TEA), &quot;Atarau&quot; (ZK-TEB), and &quot;Akaroa&quot; (ZK-TEC). In late September 1959, just prior to delivery a series of fatal accidents occurred in the US with the new aircraft. It was discovered that propeller vibration caused a weakening of the wing to engine mountings. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered a reduced speed operation for the type until remedial repair works were completed in 1961. A fourth air frame was purchased from Qantas in 1965 to replace the lost air frame of ZK-TEC (see below), it was registered out of sequence as ZK-CLX but carried over the &quot;Akaroa&quot; name from the previous aircraft. By this time TEAL had changed its name to Air New Zealand. The fifth aircraft operated was leased from Qantas in 1970 for a year to operate a joint seat share service to Australia, Qantas titles appeared along the rear of the fuselage. This aircraft used the vacant TEAL allotted ZK-TED registration but remained unnamed. The remaining Electras were sold in 1972 to United States interests.

====Douglas DC-8 Series 52====

On completion of the New Zealand Government&#x27;s purchase of TEAL&#x27;s Australian shareholdings in 1961, airline management promptly announced the purchase of pure jet powered aircraft for 1965. This was to coincide with the completion of a new International airport for Auckland and runway lengthening at Christchurch airport. Aircraft of interest included the Boeing 707–100 short bodied version operated by Qantas, Convair 880, Douglas DC-8, and after some political lobbying by pro-British government interests, Vickers VC-10. An offer by BOAC to lease surplus De Havilland Comet 4s to begin interim jet services immediately was turned down as uneconomical. After intense scrutiny of all types on offer, TEAL management approached the New Zealand Government for funds to purchase an initial three Douglas DC-8 Series 52 longer ranged jet airliners. The request was approved and an order placed in 1962 for delivery in early 1965. The aircraft were duly completed when TEAL announced a change of airline name on 1 April 1965 to Air New Zealand. The first DC-8 was already painted minus titles in anticipation of this. The aircraft never flying in actual TEAL service. After the name change, however, TEAL titles appeared on the tail fin of the new airliners for two years.

===Powerboats===
TEAL operated powerboats in support of flying-boats:

====British Power Boat Company 37.5&#x27; Empire Control Tender====
Designed by Hubert Scott-Paine for the transport of passengers using marine aircraft, the control tender arrived at Auckland on the MV &quot;Empire Star&quot; in June 1939 and was based at Mechanics&#x27; Bay. It was taken over by the Air Department during World War II.

====British Power Boat Company 23&#x27; Auxiliary Launch====
Designed by Hubert Scott-Paine for general purpose, particularly the transport of maintenance crew, gear and equipment, and light towing, the auxiliary launch arrived at Auckland on the MV &quot;Empire Star&quot; in June 1939 and was based at Mechanics&#x27; Bay. It was taken over by the Air Department during World War II.

====TEAL 40&#x27; Express Launch====
In consequence of the Air Department&#x27;s acquisition of the two flying-boat support launches, TEAL commissioned Colin Wild of Stanley Point, Auckland, to build a 40&#x27; express launch named &quot;Tasmanair&quot;, primarily for the transportation of 25 staff and 2 crew between Mechanics&#x27; Bay and Hobsonville. It was launched on 24 July 1941.
In TEAL service between 1941 and 1960, it had been based at Auckland, Laucala Bay, Fiji and Satapuala, Samoa. Following the withdrawal of flying-boats from the Coral Route in 1960, Samoa based &quot;Tasmanair&quot; was purchased by the New Zealand Government, transported to Lyttelton, New Zealand, where it was slightly modified, and shipped on to the Chatham Islands to support the RNZAF Sunderland flying-boat service at Te Whanga Lagoon.

===Fleet survivors===

Short S.45 Solent Mk IV flying-boat, TEAL ZK-AMO, RMA &quot;Aranui&quot;, was restored after years of remedial work by the Solent Preservation Society, a group of former Coral Route crew, engineers and mechanics established in 1982, and since 1990 has been on display at the Museum of Transport &amp; Technology (MOTAT) in Auckland.
Short S.25 Sandringham Mk IV Tasman Class flying-boat, TEAL ZK-AMH, RMA &quot;Auckland&quot;, formerly RAF serial JM715, which operated with TEAL from 1947 to 1950, is preserved and on display at Solent Sky aviation museum, Southampton, Hampshire, as Ansett Flying Boat Services VH-BRC &quot;Beachcomber&quot;, retired in 1981.

Lockheed L-188C Electra, TEAL ZK-TEB &quot;Atarau&quot;, is operational as a water bomber with Buffalo Airways, Canada

Douglas DC-8 Series 52, TEAL / Air New Zealand ZK-NZC, is derelict and stored at Manaus Airport, Brazil.

==Service==
On board dining was a notable feature of the trans-Tasman and later, the Coral Route. The food was cooked from scratch on board. Morning and afternoon teas were prepared on board as well as hot meals. A dumbwaiter was used to provide access to the two decks of the flying boats.

The military look of the earliest uniforms reflected the era—the aftermath of war. The male stewards&#x27; uniforms were reassuring and gave the impression that flight crew could be expected to handle any situation. In 1946, women were appointed to the TEAL flying boat crew. Many had trained as nurses which was thought to be an ideal background for coping with any situation on board. In 1961, hostesses appeared in uniforms designed by Christian Dior and made locally by El Jay.

==Accidents and incidents==
===Lockheed Electra L-188 crash===

On 27 March 1965, TEAL&#x27;s Lockheed Electra L-188 ZK-TEC &quot;Akaroa&quot;, crashed during a training flight at Whenuapai. The airline had done the following manoeuvre many times before: the Electra, flying at precisely 140 knots, could be flown over the runway threshold, throttled back to idle to drop almost vertically and land on the runway. As this would never be done on a passenger flight; the reason for the procedure remains a mystery.

On board were a captain, a check captain, a flight engineer, a navigator; the airline&#x27;s industrial personnel officer and an emergency procedures officer standing behind them.

As &quot;Akaroa&quot;&#x27;s speed dropped below 140 knots the aeroplane landed very heavily, collapsing the landing gear; &quot;Akaroa&quot; shed wings, engines, tailplane and tail as it skidded off the runway and across the grass towards the control tower. Somehow, the two standing officers stayed standing, the fire extinguishers were turned on and everyone was evacuated through the cockpit windows, with one man burning his hand on the escape rope. TEAL salvaged what they could from the wreck and the remains were quickly pushed into a gully behind the NAC hangars before the public saw them. The crash took place in the early hours of the morning. The training procedure was quickly deleted from TEAL&#x27;s manuals. TEAL purchased from Qantas a replacement Electra, VH-ECC, after it changed its name to Air New Zealand on 1 April 1965. It took the registration, ZK-CLX. At the time of the accident, ZK-TEC had the Air New Zealand logotype painted on its fuselage in anticipation of the name change.

==Ownership and change of name==
In April 1961 the Australian government decided to concentrate its subsidises with Qantas that commenced operating its own trans Tasman services in October 1961, and sold its shareholding in TEAL to the New Zealand Government, giving it 100% ownership.

On 1 April 1965 Tasman Empire Airways Limited was renamed Air New Zealand Limited, with TEAL rebranded Air New Zealand, at the same time as the Douglas DC-8 entered service. TEAL&#x27;s airline designator &quot;TE&quot; continued on with Air New Zealand until 1989. Thereafter, its international flights adopted the airline designator &quot;NZ&quot; formerly used by the New Zealand National Airways Corporation for its domestic flights.

<doc id="1128262" wikidata="Q3400440" url="?curid=1128262" title="Daniel Rowland (preacher)">
<text>Daniel Rowland (also spelt Rowlands, 1713 – 16 October 1790) served as an Evangelist and early on as an Anglican curate. He was one of the foremost figures in the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist revival, along with the evangelist Howell Harris and the hymnist William Williams. For 55 years Daniel Rowland was one of the leading evangelists in Wales.

==Curacies==
Rowland was born in Nantcwnlle, Ceredigion, in either 1713 or 1711. For most of his life he was curate in the parishes of Nantcwnlle and Llangeitho. 

Following his conversion by Griffith Jones, Llanddowror, in 1735, he became renowned as a preacher and made Llangeitho memorable as a centre for Calvinistic Methodism in Wales.

The Anglican Church authorities deprived him of his Nantcwnlle curacy in about 1763, an action which was unpopular with parishioners. Following this, he established a Methodist &quot;cause&quot; in Llangeitho, and by 1770 was said to be attracting congregations of over a thousand, making it necessary to preach outdoors. This practice became an influence on the English Methodist preacher George Whitefield.

==Preaching and relations with Howell Harris==
Rowland&#x27;s early preaching gave much attention to God&#x27;s judgement in his sermons. As he matured in his ministry, he placed more emphasis on the saving work of Jesus on the Cross. His theology and character were seen as more consistent and stable than those of his counterpart Howell Harris, whom he met in 1737. One of the best-known of Rowland&#x27;s sermons is &quot;The Redeemer&#x27;s Voice&quot;, which takes as its text a passage from the Book of Revelation.

At first Rowland and Harris worked together as leaders of the Methodist revival, but by 1741, they had fallen out, and in 1750 they ceased to cooperate.

==Family==
One of Rowland&#x27;s great-grandchildren was the novelist Anne Adalisa Puddicombe (Allen Raine). His grandson was the antiquarian Daniel Rowland.

<doc id="1128263" wikidata="Q16974110" url="?curid=1128263" title="Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry">
<text>The Battle for the Paul Bunyan Trophy is an American college football rivalry between the Michigan Wolverines and the Michigan State Spartans. The teams have met 116 times since 1898, including in every year since 1945.

The winner of each year&#x27;s game receives the Paul Bunyan – Governor of Michigan Trophy, a four-foot wooden statue of a lumberjack. It was first presented in 1953, when Michigan State football began competing as a member of the Big Ten Conference.

Michigan leads the series with an overall record of 74–38–5, in part because Michigan State won only two games (in 1913 and 1915, under head coach John Macklin) and tied three others in the first 28 years of the rivalry. Since 1949, the series is 41–32–2 in favor of Michigan.

Forty-four of the first 50 games were played on Michigan&#x27;s home field; the teams began alternating home fields in 1958. The game has never been contested anywhere besides Ann Arbor or East Lansing.

The Spartans won four consecutive games from 1934 to 1937 under head coach Charlie Bachman, then lost 12 in a row after the arrival of Fritz Crisler as Michigan&#x27;s head coach in 1938. The Spartans&#x27; longest run of success against the Wolverines was in the 1950s and 1960s, when they went 14–4–2 under head coaches Biggie Munn and Duffy Daugherty.

The pendulum shifted back to the Wolverines under Bo Schembechler and his successors: Michigan won 30 of 38 contests from 1970 to 2007. After Mike Hart said in 2007 that the Spartans were the Wolverines&#x27; &quot;little brother&quot;, Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio led his team to victory in seven of eight games from 2008 to 2015. From 2016 to 2019, Michigan won three out of four, but the Spartans won the 2020 and 2021 games under new head coach Mel Tucker, and Michigan won the next three games from 2022 to 2024.

The Big Ten Conference removed the divisional format in 2024, but designated the Michigan-Michigan State game one of the 11 rivalry games guaranteed to continue under the conference&#x27;s &quot;Flex Protect Model&quot;. Because the Big Ten Championship Game features the top two teams in the conference, the schools could theoretically meet twice in a season.

==Paul Bunyan Trophy==

In 1953, the &quot;Paul Bunyan – Governor of Michigan Trophy&quot;, or simply the Paul Bunyan Trophy, was introduced into the rivalry. It is a four-foot tall wooden statue of Paul Bunyan, the giant lumberjack of American folklore, mounted on a five-foot base. It reflects Michigan&#x27;s history as a major lumber-producing state. The trophy was first presented by Michigan governor G. Mennen Williams to commemorate Michigan State&#x27;s first year of football competition in the Big Ten.

Prior to awarding the first trophy in 1953, Michigan enjoyed an overwhelming 33-9-3 series advantage, leading athletic director Fritz Crisler to reportedly plan to refuse the trophy if Michigan had won. Crisler&#x27;s protests turned out to be irrelevant, as Michigan State won the first trophy game afterwards displaying it in Jenison Fieldhouse.

The following year in 1954, the trophy was left on the field for half an hour after Michigan defeated the Spartans. &quot;We&#x27;ll find a place for the trophy,&quot; Crisler told &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; after the game. The Paul Bunyan Trophy was then stored in an equipment locker at Michigan Stadium.

Despite winning in 1954 and 1955, Michigan did not engrave their scores onto the neglected trophy. When the Spartans won in 1956, they engraved the Wolverine victories onto the trophy. The Spartans possessed the trophy for the next eight years, tied for the longest the trophy has remained at one school, and part of a streak during which the Paul Bunyan Trophy was in East Lansing for 11 of 12 years.

The 1958 game ended in a 12–12 tie. The favored Spartans were so embarrassed that they didn&#x27;t win, they originally refused to keep the trophy while Michigan also refused. Michigan State eventually relented and kept the trophy.

In 1999, Michigan coach Lloyd Carr called it &quot;the ugliest trophy in college football&quot;, but added: &quot;When you don&#x27;t have him, you miss him.&quot;

==Notable games==
===1898: The first game===
The first game in the rivalry was played in Ann Arbor on October 12, 1898, with Michigan University defeating the nascent Michigan Agricultural College (MAC, with 405 total students enrolled), 39–0. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; wrote that the contest was &quot;essentially a practice game,&quot; as Michigan played 25 different players during the game. Charles Widman scored two touchdowns, and Leo J. Keena kicked a field goal from a place-kick, &quot;the first time a Michigan eleven has ever scored in that fashion.&quot; After the 1898 shutout, Michigan sent its freshman team against State Agricultural College for the next three years.

===1908: First game in East Lansing and first tie===
In 1908, the game was played for the first time in East Lansing, before 6,000 spectators at East Lansing&#x27;s College Field. When the game ended in a scoreless tie, the Aggies&#x27; fans &quot;went wild with delight&quot;. In Ann Arbor, the result was met with disbelief among Michigan fans who had expected an easy win. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; called it &quot;the greatest game of football ever seen in this part of the state.&quot;

===1910: M.A.C.&#x27;s undefeated season spoiled===

On October 15, 1910, Michigan beat Michigan Agricultural 6–3 at Ferry Field. In games against other opponents, the 1910 Michigan Agricultural team compiled a record of 6–0 and outscored opponents 165 to 2 (including a 17–0 victory over Notre Dame). Prior to the Michigan game, the M. A. C. student body adopted the slogan, &quot;On to Michigan.&quot; After a scoreless first half, the Aggies blocked two punts in the third quarter. On the second occasion, the punt was blocked and rolled to Michigan&#x27;s 12-yard line where the Aggies recovered the ball. Leon Hill kicked a field goal from the 21-yard line, and the Aggies&#x27; maintained a 3–0 lead into the fourth quarter. With less than five minutes left in the game, Michigan quarterback Shorty McMillan completed a pass to Stanley Borleske who ran 50 yards to the Aggies&#x27; 15-yard line. Due to a penalty, the Wolverines had five unsuccessful chances to score the touchdown after advancing to the three-yard line. Michigan then lined up for a field goal, but the play was a fake. Don Green took the snap from center and ran for the touchdown.

===1913 and 1915: M.A.C.&#x27;s first victories===

On October 18, 1913, Michigan Agricultural secured its first victory over Michigan, 12–7. The Aggies&#x27; fullback, George E. Julian, scored two touchdowns, and Blake Miller returned a Michigan fumble 45 yards for a touchdown. Miller suffered a blow to the head during the game and was hospitalized in serious condition. After the game, &quot;The Michigan Alumnus&quot; made note of the Aggies&#x27; potential as an athletic threat: &quot;This victory with the football tie in 1908, and the Farmers&#x27; clean sweep in baseball in 1912, point to the fact that M.A.C. will bear watching by Michigan.&quot;

In 1915, the Aggies again defeated Michigan, 24–0. Neno DaPrato scored two touchdowns and kicked a field goal for the Aggies. In the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, E. A. Batchelor summed up the game: &quot;Twenty-four to nothing sounds like a horrible beating but it doesn&#x27;t even begin to express how completely the M.A.C. team outplayed and outfought Michigan&#x27;s. It wasn&#x27;t merely a defeat for the Maize and Blue but a massacre, a rout, an annihilation. . . . Michigan was beaten in everything. In music, cheering, fighting and playing football, the Aggies just naturally outclassed their foemen so badly that the Maize and Blue crowd could find no single straw at which to clutch as it drowned in a sea of tears.&quot; The victory was the second in three years against the Wolverines under head coach John Macklin.

===1934: MSC snaps Michigan&#x27;s 22-game unbeaten streak===
In 1934, Michigan State College (The Spartans as of 1925) coach Charlie Bachman led the Spartans to a 16–0 victory in Ann Arbor. Michigan State dominated the game statistically with 182 yards from scrimmage to 72 for Michigan, and with 15 first downs to three for Michigan. The loss broke Michigan&#x27;s 22-game unbeaten streak dating back to October 1931, though it contained multiple ties. After the game, a group of Michigan State supporters rushed the field and attempted to tear down the goal posts at the north end of the field. Michigan fans then charged the field to protect the goal posts. Fist fights ensued, and the &quot;rioting&quot; continued for 20 minutes. Bachman&#x27;s Spartans continued to dominate with a 25–6 victory in 1935, a 21–7 victory in 1936, and a 19–14 victory in 1937.

===1940: The Tom Harmon game===
In 1940, Michigan defeated Michigan State College by a 21 to 14 score. Michigan halfback Tom Harmon scored all 21 points for Michigan, running for three touchdowns and kicking the extra points as well. Harmon went on to win the 1940 Heisman Trophy.

===1947: Crisler&#x27;s &quot;Mad Magicians&quot; spoil &quot;Biggie&quot; Munn&#x27;s debut===
In 1947, &quot;Biggie&quot; Munn took over as Michigan State College&#x27;s head coach. Munn had been an assistant coach at Michigan under Fritz Crisler from 1938 to 1945. On September 27, 1947, Munn made his debut as the Spartans&#x27; head coach, playing his former mentor in Ann Arbor. In one of the first televised football games in the State of Michigan (broadcast on WWJ-TV), Michigan won by a 55–0 score, outgaining the Spartans by 504 yards to 56. The 1947 Michigan team, regarded as one of the best in school history, became known as the &quot;Mad Magicians&quot;. Michigan went on to complete back-to-back undefeated seasons in 1947 and 1948.

===1950 to 1953: Munn&#x27;s Spartans win four in a row===
For the second time in series history, Michigan State College won four consecutive games against Michigan from 1950 to 1953. In these peak years of the &quot;Biggie&quot; Munn era, the Spartans lost only two games in four years. The 1950 team was ranked No. 8 and defeated Michigan, 14–7. The 1951 team was ranked No. 2 and defeated Michigan, 25–0. The undefeated 1952 team won the national championship and defeated Michigan, 27–13. And the 1953 team was ranked No. 3, won the Big Ten championship in its first year of conference play, and defeated Michigan, 14–6.

===1956: No. 2 vs. No. 5===
In 1956, the teams met with the Spartans ranked No. 2 and the Wolverines ranked No. 5 – the highest combined ranking in series history. After a scoreless first half in which Michigan dominated statistically, turnovers led to two Michigan State scores. In the third quarter, the Spartans intercepted a pass at Michigan&#x27;s 38-yard line, setting up a 20-yard field goal, and in the fourth quarter, the Spartans recovered a fumble at Michigan&#x27;s 21-yard line, leading to a Spartan touchdown and the final margin of victory, 9–0.

===1969: Daugherty defeats Schembechler in his first season===
In 1969, Bo Schembechler made his debut as Michigan&#x27;s head coach. The Wolverines were ranked No. 13 in the AP Poll when they played Duffy Daugherty&#x27;s Spartans. Led by halfback Don Highsmith (134 rushing yards and two touchdowns on a Big Ten record 30 carries) and quarterback Bill Triplett (143 rushing yards and a touchdown on 18 carries), the Spartans beat Michigan and outgained the Wolverines on the ground by a total of 348 yards to 176. The game was Michigan&#x27;s only conference loss in 1969.

===1978: Ed Smith to Kirk Gibson===
In 1978, Michigan was ranked No. 5 when the unranked Spartans visited Ann Arbor. Michigan had won the previous eight series meetings, but quarterback Ed Smith led the Spartans to a 24–15 upset win. Smith passed for 248 yards, including five completions to flanker Kirk Gibson for 82 yards. Michigan State&#x27;s total of 496 yards (307 in the first half) was the most allowed by a Michigan team since 1961. Michigan quarterback Rick Leach, who had only one interception in Michigan&#x27;s first four games, threw three in the first half.

===1990: &quot;No. One vs. No One&quot;===
&quot;No. One vs. No One&quot; was the tag line used for the 1990 game. Michigan came into the game ranked No. 1 in the country. With six seconds left, Elvis Grbac threw a touchdown pass to Derrick Alexander to make it 28–27 Michigan State. Michigan coach Gary Moeller elected to go for a two-point conversion for the win. Grbac threw an incomplete pass to Desmond Howard, but the play was controversial since a Spartan defender appeared to have interfered with Howard. A columnist in &quot;The Detroit News&quot; wrote: &quot;Michigan State cornerback Eddie Brown had tripped him. No discussion. No debate. It was a clear and obvious foul that a million and one eyes in the stands and on national television could see, but somehow not one single referee in this joint managed to catch a glimpse of.&quot; The Wolverines then attempted an onside kick, which they recovered. Grbac scrambled and threw a Hail Mary that was tipped and intercepted to end the game.

===1997: Six interceptions en route to national championship===
In 1997, ESPN College Gameday broadcast from East Lansing, as No. 5 Michigan defeated No. 15 Michigan State, 23–7. The Wolverines intercepted six Spartan passes, five off Spartan quarterback Todd Schultz. The interceptions included a one-handed catch by eventual 1997 Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson after which he managed to get one foot in bounds on the sideline. Marcus Ray had a pair of interceptions. Michigan completed the season undefeated and was recognized as the national champion in the AP Poll.

===2001: &quot;Clockgate&quot; and &quot;Spartan Bob&quot;===
In the 2001 game, also known as &quot;Clockgate&quot;, Michigan entered the game ranked No. 6 in the nation. With under three minutes left, the Spartans received the ball at midfield, trailing 24–20. A Michigan face mask penalty resulted in 15 yards and an automatic first down. Two plays later, the Wolverines were penalized for having 12 men on the field. Michigan State was incorrectly charged with their final timeout on that play; the Spartans should not have been because of the U-M penalty. With 17 seconds remaining, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker attempted to scramble for a touchdown but was stopped at the one-yard line. The Spartans rushed to the line and spiked the ball, ostensibly with one second remaining on the clock. On the next play, Smoker threw a touchdown pass to T. J. Duckett to win the game, 26–24.

Michigan coaches, players, and the ABC broadcasters argued that the clock should have expired before the final play and that the timekeeper, &quot;Spartan Bob&quot; Stehlin, purposely stopped the clock before the ball was grounded. Dave Parry, the Big Ten conference&#x27;s coordinator of football officials, said, &quot;that play, as much as we&#x27;ve put that under a high-powered microscope, was correct. We could not prove that timer wrong.&quot; The Big Ten changed its timekeeping policy for the 2002 season, requiring that time be kept on the field by a neutral official.

===2004: Braylon Edwards leads the comeback===
Despite being an underdog on the road in Ann Arbor, unranked Michigan State built up a 27–10 lead in the 4th quarter against #12 ranked Michigan. The Wolverines eventually awoke and added a 24 yard field goal by Garrett Rivas to cut the MSU lead to 14. Michigan recovered the ensuing onside kick and went down the field to make it a 27–20 MSU lead after a 36-yard touchdown reception by Braylon Edwards. Michigan&#x27;s defense was able to force an MSU punt and once again, Edwards demonstrated late game heroics with an iconic 21-yard touchdown catch to knot the score at 27–27. Michigan scored 17 points in less than four minutes. A potential MSU game-winning field goal attempt fell short and the game went into overtime for the first time in series history. The teams traded field goals and touchdowns in the first two overtime periods, respectively. Another touchdown reception by Edwards and a successful two-point conversion put Michigan ahead, 45–37. MSU failed to answer with a touchdown and Michigan&#x27;s comeback was complete with a 45–37 victory in triple overtime. Edwards amassed 189 yards receiving along with three touchdowns. Michigan&#x27;s true freshman quarterback Chad Henne threw for 273 yards and four touchdowns.

===2007: The &quot;little brother&quot; game===

The 2007 game marked Michigan&#x27;s sixth straight win over Michigan State. The Wolverines once again narrowly won with a comeback in the fourth quarter, winning 28–24. Michigan quarterback Chad Henne led two touchdown drives in the final 7:35 of the game, completing touchdown passes to Greg Mathews and Mario Manningham, to lead the Wolverines back from a 24–14 deficit. Henne finished the game with 18 completions for 211 yards and four touchdowns, while Manningham had eight receptions for 129 yards and two touchdowns. After the game, the Michigan team held a &quot;moment of silence&quot; for Michigan State, a response to Michigan State head coach Mark Dantonio making a comment about taking a &quot;moment of silence&quot; for Michigan after their embarrassing upset loss to Appalachian State at the beginning of the season.

In a post-game interview, Michigan running back Mike Hart referred to the Spartans as the Wolverines&#x27; &quot;little brother.&quot; &quot;I was just laughing,” Hart said of Michigan State taking the lead. &quot;I thought it was funny. They got excited. Sometimes you get your little brother excited when you’re playing basketball, and you let him get the lead, and then you come back and take it back.&quot; Mark Dantonio later responded to Hart&#x27;s comment: &quot;I find a lot of the things they do amusing. They need to check themselves sometimes. But just remember, pride comes before the fall... This game is an important game. So they want to mock us all they want to mock us, I&#x27;m telling them: it&#x27;s not over. So they can print that crap all they want all over their locker room. It&#x27;s not over. It&#x27;ll never be over here. It&#x27;s just starting... I&#x27;m going to be a coach here for a long time. It&#x27;s not over. It&#x27;s just starting.&quot;. After the &quot;little brother&quot; comment, Michigan State would go on to win 10 of the next 16 games.

===2008: Dantonio&#x27;s promise kept -- &quot;Pride Comes Before The Fall&quot;===
In 2008, Michigan scored on a pass to running back Brandon Minor, who was only able to get one foot on a pylon. The pass was initially called incomplete, but the play was reviewed and incorrectly ruled a touchdown. During halftime, ABC-TV displayed the NCAA rule on the broadcast screen and concluded that the replay official was incorrect in awarding the touchdown to Michigan; ABC indicated officials on the field had been correct in originally ruling the play incomplete. The commissioner of the Big Ten later acknowledged that the call was wrong. The two teams traded touchdowns for much of the game before the Spartans finally pulled away in the fourth quarter, winning 35–21. Starting with the victory in 2008, Dantonio led the Spartans to victories in seven of the next eight games.

===2012: Gibbons&#x27; field goal as time runs out===
In 2012, the Wolverines defeated the Spartans, 12–10, for the first Michigan victory since 2007. Michigan did not score a touchdown but kicked four field goals. Michigan led, 9–7, in the fourth quarter, but the Spartans ran a fake punt on fourth-and-nine from their own 30-yard line. The gamble paid off, and the Spartans kicked a field goal to go up 10–9. Michigan was forced to punt the ball away with four minutes left, but the Michigan defense forced a three-and-out and they got the ball back at their own 39 with 2:11 left. Denard Robinson completed a 20-yard pass on fourth down to advance to the Spartans&#x27; 25-yard line, With nine seconds left, Michigan spiked the ball and Brendan Gibbons lined up to kick a potential game-winning field goal. Mark Dantonio called time out to ice the kicker, but Gibbons split the uprights to win it for Michigan, 12–10. After the game, the students rushed the field in celebration. This was the 900th all-time win for the Wolverines, making them the first program to reach this level in college football history.

===2013: −48 rushing yards===
On November 2, 2013, in East Lansing, Michigan State dominated Michigan defensively, winning 29–6. Michigan QB Devin Gardner was sacked seven times and Michigan accumulated the fewest rushing yards for a game in its entire history (−48 yards). The Spartans held the Wolverines to their lowest point total in the series since 1967, the last time Michigan State had won by more than 20 points. This was the second game in a row that Michigan failed to score a touchdown against Michigan State. This game marked MSU&#x27;s fifth win of the previous six games in the series.

===2014: The stake game===

On October 25, 2014, as they were coming onto the East Lansing field prior to the game, the Michigan team drove a stake into the turf, angering the Spartans. Michigan finally scored its first touchdown against MSU in three years with just 3:40 remaining in the game, but, after Michigan made the 2-point conversion, Michigan State marched downfield and scored a final touchdown with 0:28 remaining. This was notable because four of the previous six games ended with the Spartans taking a knee inside the Michigan red zone, instead of adding a final score. In his postgame press conference, Mark Dantonio referenced the stake incident in explaining the decision to add a final touchdown. MSU won 35–11.

===2015: &quot;Trouble with the snap&quot;===
On October 17, 2015, the game was played in Ann Arbor for the first time since 2012. The #12 Wolverines, led by first-year coach Jim Harbaugh, entered the game 5–1. The #7 Spartans came into the game 6–0. This was the first meeting of coaches Mark Dantonio and Harbaugh. Michigan scored first and did not trail until the final play of the game. Late in the 4th quarter, with the Wolverines leading 23–21, Michigan State drove into field goal range, but a sack pushed them outside the 40. They failed to convert on 4th and long, giving Michigan the ball and seemingly the victory. However, with 10 seconds left in the game, Michigan was faced with a 4th and short and decided to punt. Michigan State pressured with 10 defenders while Michigan sent 2 players downfield to cover the punt. The numeric mismatch on the line allowed easy penetration while the Wolverine long-snapper quick-snapped a low ball, which was bobbled by punter Blake O&#x27;Neill. The ball was picked up by Michigan State’s Jalen Watts-Jackson, who scored the game-winning touchdown at the last second. ESPN commentator Sean McDonough described the play as &quot;unbelievable&quot;. The final margin of victory for MSU was 27–23. Michigan State did not lead at any point in the game until time expired, but they outgained Michigan in the contest 386 to 230 yards.

===2017: The first night game===
On October 7, 2017, Michigan and Michigan State met for the first night game in series history. Michigan came into the game ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll and 4–0 on the season. The Michigan State Spartans came into the game unranked at 3–1 on the season, with their only loss at that point to Notre Dame in East Lansing. After an early Wolverine field goal, Michigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke ran 13 yards for a touchdown and later threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Madre London to give the Spartans a 14–3 lead at halftime. The second half was played in heavy rain and winds. Michigan State forced five turnovers (two fumbles and three interceptions) in the game. Michigan scored a touchdown in the third quarter and attempted a Hail Mary pass in the closing seconds, but a deflection by MSU&#x27;s Joe Bachie in the endzone cemented the Spartans&#x27; 14–10 win. The win was the Spartans&#x27; eighth in 10 games against Michigan. Michigan finished the season unranked, while Michigan State was ranked No. 15 in the final AP poll.

===2018: Pregame skirmish===
On October 20, 2018, Michigan defeated Michigan State, 21–7. The Wolverines gained 395 yards and held the Spartans to 94 yards. The Spartans were late in conducting their traditional pregame walk down the field, and when they did so, several Michigan players had already taken the field for warmups. The Spartans walked, arms linked, through the Michigan players, resulting in a skirmish. After the Spartans left the field, Michigan linebacker Devin Bush tore up the Spartans&#x27; midfield logo with his cleats. After the game, Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh claimed the Spartans clothes-lined one Michigan player and ripped the headphones off another and added: &quot;Total bush league. Apparently, coach Dantonio was five yards behind it all smiling.&quot; Michigan State coach Dantonio referred to Harbaugh&#x27;s comments as &quot;BS&quot; despite the fact that there is video evidence that shows otherwise. The Big Ten issued reprimands to both teams afterwards, including a $10,000 fine against Michigan State, having found that the Spartans violated the conference&#x27;s sportsmanship policy by walking across the field with linked arms and initiating contact with multiple Michigan players &quot;who were legitimately on the field&quot;. The conference also reprimanded Dantonio for &quot;failing to take action to mitigate a foreseeable conflict from occurring&quot;. Devin Bush was also reprimanded for grinding his cleats into the Spartan logo, as was Harbaugh for his post-game comments.

===2020: Halloween upset===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the game was rescheduled and played on Halloween for the first time ever. Coming into the game, Michigan was ranked 13th in the AP poll after a dominating victory on the road against Minnesota 49–24, while Michigan State lost to Rutgers 38–27, a game that ended the Spartans&#x27; 19–game win streak in home openers and Rutgers&#x27; 21-game Big Ten losing streak dating back to 2017. Despite Michigan being 21.5 point favorites and ESPN&#x27;s Football Power Index giving Michigan State just a 6.6% chance at winning, the Spartans beat the Wolverines 27–24 to reclaim the Paul Bunyan Trophy. This win also made Mel Tucker the first Michigan State head coach to beat Michigan in his first season since Nick Saban in 1995, as well as only the third head coach of either program to win his first game in the rivalry as head coach in the past 75 years (the others being Saban and Bennie Oosterbaan).

===2021: Undefeated top ten matchup===
The October 30, 2021, matchup saw both schools ranked in the top 10 for the first time since 1964. Michigan was ranked at No. 6 in both the AP and Coaches poll, while Michigan State was ranked at No. 8 in the AP and No. 7 in the Coaches poll. This game was also unique in that both schools were 7–0 or better for the first time in history. After being down by a score of 23-14 at halftime, the Spartans outscored Michigan 23-10 in the second half to pull out the 37-33 victory. Michigan State running back Kenneth Walker III ran for 197 yards and 5 touchdowns, becoming the player with the most rushing touchdowns in a single game against the Wolverines. The win also marked an MSU record with Mel Tucker becoming the first head coach to beat the Wolverines twice in his first two seasons.

===2022: Assault in the tunnel===
After a Michigan victory, Michigan defensive backs Gemon Green and JaDen McBurrows entered the Michigan Stadium tunnel alongside the MSU team and were assaulted by several Michigan State players. Chris Solari of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported that he saw Michigan State players punching, shoving and kicking McBurrows. McBurrows reportedly sustained a nose injury. A Michigan State player swung his helmet and struck Green, who sustained a concussion and facial cuts. Green dressed the following week for the Rutgers game but did not play. Michigan State suspended eight players following the incident. The Big Ten fined Michigan State $100,000 and additionally suspended Crump for the first eight games of the 2023 season. The Big Ten also reprimanded the University of Michigan for failing to “provide adequate protection for personnel of both home and visiting teams when entering and leaving playing arenas,” per conference policy. On November 23, criminal charges were filed against seven Michigan State players. Khary Crump was charged with felonious assault and eventually sentenced to probation; the other six entered a pre-plea diversion program for defendants accused of misdemeanors.

===2023: Scouting scandal, shutout in Spartan Stadium===
Ahead of the 2023 game, the Big Ten warned Michigan State that it had &quot;credible evidence&quot; of successful sign-stealing by Michigan. After it was announced that Michigan was under investigation for in-person scouting of opponents in violation of an NCAA rule, Michigan suspended a staff member, who had purchased tickets for more than 30 games at 11 Big Ten schools. Michigan State adjusted its signal calling on the field during the game. Michigan shut out Michigan State, 49–0, the largest margin of victory in the rivalry in more than 75 years, dating to Michigan&#x27;s 55–0 victory in 1947. This was also the largest defeat of Michigan State in East Lansing.

<text>Canada Glacier is a small glacier flowing south-east into the northern side of Taylor Valley in Victoria Land, Antarctica. It is in the Ross Dependency. Its melting season is in the summer.

==Description==
The glacier receives less than 10 cm of snowfall annually, and is (technically) an ecosystem. Its seasonal melting feeds Lake Hoare to the west and Lake Fryxell to the east. At the north side of its head sit the Hothem Cliffs.

==History==
The glacier was discovered and named in the course of the Terra Nova Expedition (1910–1913), under Robert Scott. Charles S. Wright, a Canadian physicist, was a member of the party that explored the area.

==Antarctic Specially Protected Area==
An area of about 1 km2 on the eastern side of the glacier is protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.131 because it contains some of the richest plant growth (bryophytes and algae) in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region. It is exceptionally important not only for its ecological and biological values, but also as a reference site for other similar ecosystems. The site comprises sloping ice-free ground with summer ponds and meltwater streams. It is unusual in receiving more consistent water flows than many other parts of the Dry Valleys region, and is sheltered from strong winds by the 20 m high glacier face.

<doc id="1128276" wikidata="Q4056092" url="?curid=1128276" title="Australian Securities and Investments Commission">
<text>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is an independent commission of the Australian Government tasked as the national corporate regulator. ASIC&#x27;s role is to regulate company and financial services and enforce laws to protect Australian consumers, investors and creditors. ASIC, which reports to the Treasurer, was established on 1 July 1998 following recommendations from the Wallis Inquiry.

==Areas of responsibility==
ASIC&#x27;s authority and scope are determined by the &quot;Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001&quot;.

ASIC&#x27;s areas of responsibility include:
*corporate governance
*financial services
*securities and derivatives
*insurance
*consumer protection
*financial literacy

ASIC&#x27;s consumer website www.moneysmart.gov.au was launched on 15 March 2011. MoneySmart replaced ASIC&#x27;s two previous consumer websites, FIDO and Understanding Money. MoneySmart aims to help people make good financial decisions by providing free, independent and unbiased information, tools and resources.

ASIC is responsible for the administering the following legislation:
* &quot;Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001&quot; (ASIC Act)
* &quot;Business Names Registration Act 2011&quot;
* &quot;Corporations Act 2001&quot; (Corporations Act)
* &quot;Insurance Contracts Act 1984&quot;
* &quot;National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009&quot; (National Credit Act)
Additionally, ASIC is also responsible for administering parts of the following legislation:
* &quot;Banking Act 1959&quot;
* &quot;Life Insurance Act 1995&quot;
* &quot;Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003&quot;
* &quot;Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997&quot;
* &quot;Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993&quot;
* &quot;Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993&quot; (SIS Act).

==Registers==
ASIC maintains Australia&#x27;s company and business name registers, which can be searched online. The types of organisations that can be searched online include companies, registered bodies, foreign companies, associations, managed investment schemes and non-registered entities. The information that is available includes current and/or historical information about the organisation, including past addresses, previous directors, and former names, as well as the organisation&#x27;s unique identification number (ABN, ACN, ARBN, ARSN), type of company or organisation (e.g., proprietary company, limited by shares), date it was registered, the next review date, location of registered office (town or suburb only), and any professional licences or registrations (e.g. an Australian financial services licence or credit licence).

==History==
ASIC was originally formed as the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), established on 1 January 1991 by the (then) ASC Act 1989. The purpose of ASC was to unify corporate regulators around Australia by replacing the National Companies and Securities Commission and the Corporate Affairs offices of the states and territories.

The corporate regulator became the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 1 July 1998, when it also became responsible for consumer protection in superannuation, insurance and deposit taking. It has since gained further responsibilities: in 2002 for credit, the Australian Stock Exchange in 2009, and Chi-X in 2011.

==Criticisms==

In 2012, ASIC called for powers to use data which had been intercepted by other intelligence agencies.

In recent times ASIC has become the subject of criticism by consumers, consumer advocates and public officials over its inaction and inefficiencies in protecting consumers from large financial institutions.

In 2015–2016 ASIC was subject to a class action claim of negligence by persons affected by the Storm Financial collapse for an alleged failure to take action, amounting to malfeasance. However, Justice Gleeson of the Federal Court of Australia struck out the statement of claim of the plaintiffs as being unarguable.

ASIC has not acted against the Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia) (FOS) despite the organisation being exposed as having generated misleading file notes and then attempting to offer them in the discovery phase in a Victorian Supreme Court case. FOS were caught out and exposed by a consumer and ASIC has not acted against FOS.

ASIC did commence proceedings against the largest four banks in Australia in 2016 for rigging of Australian benchmark interest rates. However criticism has been leveled against the regulator for failing to take action for over five years. Questions remain about how this will affect consumer civil causes of action against banks involved, given that the statute of limitations tends to be six years in Australia.

In 2016, ASIC became the subject of heavy criticism in the debate concerning the creation of a Royal Commission into banking and financial services.

<text>Coats Land is a region in Antarctica which lies westward of Queen Maud Land and forms the eastern shore of the Weddell Sea, extending in a general northeast–southwest direction between 20°00′W and 36°00′W. The northeast part was discovered from the &quot;Scotia&quot; by William S. Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, 1902–1904. He gave the name Coats Land for James Coats, Jr., and Major Andrew Coats, the two chief supporters of the expedition.

<text>The Purbeck Hills, also called the Purbeck Ridge or simply the Purbecks, are a ridge of chalk downs in Dorset, England. The ridge is formed by the structure known as the Purbeck Monocline, and extends from Lulworth Cove in the west to Old Harry Rocks in the east, where it meets the sea. The hills are part of a system of chalk downlands in southern England formed from the Chalk Group which also includes Salisbury Plain and the South Downs. For most of their length the chalk of the Purbeck Hills is protected from coastal erosion by a band of resistant Portland limestone. Where this band ends, at Durlston Head, the clay and chalk behind has been eroded, creating Poole Bay and the Solent. The ridge of steeply dipping chalk that forms the Purbeck Hills continues further east on the Isle of Wight.

The height of the chalk ridge and proximity to Poole Harbour and the south coast have made the hills of strategic importance. There are a number of Iron Age, Roman and Saxon archaeological sites, such as Nine Barrow Down. At Corfe Castle the hills are broken twice leaving a steep round hill between the ridges on which stood a medieval castle, guarding the only easy route through the hills, until the English Civil War of the 17th century, when it was slighted.

Some of the ridge, around the village of Tyneham, near Lulworth, has been closed to the public for use by the army as a firing range. This has protected them from damage from farming and development, and these areas are now nature reserves. At the eastern end Ballard Down is a National Trust nature reserve which is managed for its calcareous grassland habitat.

==Named hills==
* Nine Barrow Down (199 m)
* Ridgeway Hill (199 m)
* Creech Barrow Hill (193 m) - sometimes counted as part of the Dorset Heaths
* Bindon Hill (168 m), overlooking Lulworth Cove

<doc id="1128300" wikidata="Q656119" url="?curid=1128300" title="Ice worm">
<text>Ice worms (also written as ice-worms or iceworms, or also called glacial or glacier worms) are enchytraeid annelids of the genus Mesenchytraeus. The majority of the species in the genus are abundant in gravel beds or the banks of riverine habitats, but the best-known members of the genus are found in glacial ice. They include the only annelid worms known to spend their entire lives in glacial ice, and some of the few metazoans to complete their entire life cycle at conditions below .

They were discovered in a wide range of environments, which include level snowfields, steep avalanche cones, crevasse walls, glacial rivers and pools, and hard glacier ice. These organisms are unique in that they can simply move between tightly packed ice crystals. They utilize setae, which are small bristles found on the outside of their bodies, to grip the ice and pull themselves along.

The genus contains 77 species, including the North American glacier ice worm (&quot;Mesenchytraeus solifugus&quot;) and the Yosemite snow worm (&quot;Mesenchytraeus gelidus&quot;).

Ice worms eat snow algae and bacteria. They live at zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), but if temperatures dip even slightly below that, according to a Washington State University researcher, the worms die.

== History ==
In North America, the first ice worms species were discovered in 1887 in Alaska, on the Muir Glacier. These glacier ice worms can be found on glaciers in Alaska, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia. They have not been found in other glaciated regions of the world.

== Description ==
The specific name &quot;solifugus&quot; for the North American species, &quot;Mesenchytraeus solifugus&quot;, is Latin for &quot;sun-avoiding,&quot; as ice worms retreat underneath the ice before dawn. Enzymes in ice worms have very low optimal temperatures, and can be denatured at even a few degrees above . When ice worms are exposed to temperatures as modest as , their membrane structures disassociate and fall apart (i.e., &quot;melt&quot;) causing the worm itself to &quot;liquefy.&quot; Ice worms are several centimeters long, and can be black, blue, or white. They come to the surface of the glaciers in the evening and morning. On Suiattle Glacier in the North Cascades, population counts indicated over 7 billion ice worms.

It is not known how ice worms tunnel through the ice. Some scientists believe they travel through microscopic fissures in ice sheets, while others believe they secrete some chemical which can melt ice by lowering its freezing point, like an antifreeze. They feed on snow algae.

<doc id="1128302" wikidata="Q1471137" url="?curid=1128302" title="Lake Fryxell">
<text>Lake Fryxell is a frozen lake long, between Canada Glacier and Commonwealth Glaciers at the lower end of Taylor Valley in Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was mapped in the early 1900s and named during Operation Deep Freeze in the 1950s. There are several forms of algae living in the waters and a weather station located at the lake.

==Geography==
Lake Fryxell is deep, so that the deepest portion of the lake is below sea level. The lake is dammed by Canada Glacier, so that it has no natural outflow. It is covered with about of ice, but during the summer months, the ice can clear along the shoreline. There are a few small islands as well as several shallow areas.

The average annual ablation is between and , which is significantly lower when compared to other nearby frozen water bodies, such as the waters adjacent to Ross Island.

===Watershed===
The watershed contains thirteen streams flowing into the lake, forming a watershed that has an area roughly in size. Where a few of the streams enter the lake there are well-developed deltas. The streams flow for about 4–12 weeks out of the year. Nearly half of the water flowing into the lake comes from Canada, Lost Seal, and Von Guerard streams.

==Climate==
Lake Fryxell is located within the McMurdo Dry Valleys, which experience an exceptionally dry climate partially due to katabatic winds descending from the nearby mountains. These winds can exceed under certain conditions and can raise the temperature, melting snow and evaporating water. Average precipitation in the area surrounding the valley is equivalent to about of rain a year and a mean annual temperature of with summer temperatures getting above freezing.

==Lake Fryxell Camp==
Mapped by the British Antarctic Expedition under Robert Falcon Scott, 1910–13, the lake was visited by Professor T.L. Péwé during Operation Deep Freeze, 1957–58, who named it for Dr. Fritiof M. Fryxell, glacial geologist of Augustana College, Illinois.

Lake Fryxell is a focus of scientific research and contains a semi-permanent camp containing four labs and two other buildings. Electricity is generated at the camp using solar panels and a wind turbine. The four labs are used for experimenting with radioactive materials, electronics, chemicals and other materials. When staying at the camp, researchers sleep in tents, some of which are the same style as those used in some Antarctic expeditions in the early 20th century. There is internet and phone access at the camp.

Research activities largely deal with the lake itself and can include scientists diving into the water. The camp has existed since at least 1984.

==Ecology==
There are multiple forms of algae within the lake, including a sizable population of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Some samples of these bacteria live in very specific areas, such as specific water depths or locations causing them to experience differing physiochemical conditions. There are also a few archaea living in the anoxic zone, that contribute to the methane pockets under 12 m below the surface.

There is a lack of oxygen within Lake Fryxell, which is unique when compared to other lakes in the region because the euphotic zone only extends to below the lake surface. This creates an environment similar to the planet about 2.4 billion years ago. Within anoxic areas, scientists have found microbial mats that create small pockets saturated with oxygen.

<text>Joely Fisher ( ; born October 29, 1967) is an American actress and singer, the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Connie Stevens, and half-sister of actress Carrie Fisher. Her breakthrough came in 1994, starring as Paige Clark in the ABC sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 55th Golden Globe Awards. Fisher later starred in the 1999 comedy film &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; and had leading roles in the Lifetime comedy-drama &quot;Wild Card&quot; (2003–2005), and Fox sitcom &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot; (2006–2010).

The national members of the trade union SAG-AFTRA elected Fisher as secretary-treasurer on September 2, 2021.

== Early life ==
Joely Fisher was born on October 29, 1967, in Burbank, California, one of two children born to Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Fisher and Connie Stevens (née Concetta Ingolia), both entertainers. Her father was Jewish, whose parents immigrated to the United States from the Russian Empire, whereas her mother was Catholic and of Ashkenazi Jewish, Irish, and Italian descent. Fisher has a younger sister, Tricia Leigh Fisher. Her parents divorced in 1969, after which she and Tricia were raised by Stevens. Her father married a total of five times, with Stevens as his third wife. Joely and Tricia Fisher had two older half-siblings, Carrie Fisher and Todd Fisher, from her father&#x27;s first marriage, with Debbie Reynolds.

Joely Fisher and her sister Tricia toured the world with Stevens, attending different schools and learning from tutors. Fisher graduated from Beverly Hills High School, then attended Emerson College in Boston, as well as the University of Paris for one semester. In the summer of 1987, Fisher attended an acting retreat conducted in Italy by coach Sandra Seacat.

Fisher was named Miss Golden Globe at the 49th Golden Globe Awards in 1992.

== Career ==
Her first film role was Averil in the comedy &quot;Pretty Smart&quot; (1987), which starred her sister, Tricia. Fisher then played Kris Stone on the &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot; drama &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot; (1991) opposite Danielle Ferland. Next came the feature &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; (1994) starring Nick Nolte, which helped her career as bigger roles followed. She also had a variety of guest roles on series such as &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, &quot;Blossom&quot;, &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; and &quot;Coach&quot;.

In 1994, Fisher was cast as Paige Clark on the sitcom &quot;Ellen,&quot; first appearing in the second season. She played the role for four seasons until the series ended in 1998. That same year, she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 55th Golden Globe Awards. She followed &quot;Ellen&quot; with the role of Dr. Brenda Bradford in the film &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; (1999).

Fisher&#x27;s Broadway debut was as a replacement for the role of Betty Rizzo in the revival of &quot;Grease&quot; (1994). She was also a replacement for the role of Sally Bowles in the revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1998). Her vocal range is alto.

Fisher&#x27;s career in music not only landed her on Broadway but she was featured in albums. Her most noted album was &quot;Tradition: a Family at Christmas&quot; which she, her sister Tricia and their mother Connie Stevens sang various Christmas carols. She sang her own solo on &quot;Grown Up Christmas List&quot;. Her vocals are also heard singing &quot;One for My Baby&quot; in Harold Arlen&#x27;s album &quot;STAGE&quot;.

From 2003 until 2005, Fisher starred in the Lifetime network&#x27;s drama series &quot;Wild Card&quot; as insurance investigator Zoe Busiek. After that, she had a recurring role as Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman)&#x27;s boss Nina Fletcher on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. From 2006 until 2010, Fisher starred opposite actor Brad Garrett as Joy Stark in the Fox TV sitcom &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot;.

In 2021, Fisher starred as Irene Cody in the Lifetime film &quot;Girl in the Basement&quot; which was inspired by the Fritzl case.

Fisher serves on the advisory board of Voters of Tomorrow, an advocacy organization that promotes political engagement among Generation Z.

== Personal life ==
Fisher married cinematographer Christopher Duddy in 1996. They have three daughters, two who were born in 2001 and 2006, and a third who was adopted in September 2008. She is also stepmother to Duddy&#x27;s two sons, Cameron Duddy, who is the bass guitarist for the country music band Midland, (b. 1986) and Collin (b. 1988). As of at least 2004, the family lives in Los Angeles next to Fisher&#x27;s sister Tricia, with whom she is close.

In late 2008, she became an artist ambassador for Save the Children. She traveled to Xai-Xai, Mozambique, to visit with children that are part of the child sponsorship programs.

<text>Mesenchytraeus solifugus, commonly called an [[ice worm]], is a species of oligochaete worm that inhabits coastal glaciers in northwestern North America. &quot;M. solifugus&quot; is dark brown and grows to about 15 mm long and 0.5 mm wide. It has a high population density and is common in suitable habitat. It can only survive at temperatures of approximately –7 °C to 5 °C. The ice worm is studied for its ability to survive in low temperatures. It has heavy pigment, absorbing most colors; however, it burrows into the glacier to avoid strong sunlight.

==History and taxonomy==
This species was first reported from Muir Glacier in Alaska. Carlo Emery named it &quot;solifugus&quot; in 1898, meaning &quot;fleeing from the sun&quot;. Phylogeny suggests that it evolved from an aquatic ancestor.

==Description==
Ice worms are the only known psychrophilic annelids. Adult ice worms are approximately long. They live their entire lives in snow or ice. The ice worm&#x27;s dark pigmentation helps protect it from solar ultraviolet radiation. Their fluid and flexible bodies are able to squeeze through air holes and tiny crevasses in ice. Their lifespan is believed to be five to ten years.

Ice worms have an elongated head pore, with sensing organs located on their prostomium and ventral surface. These organs are responsible for chemo-, thermo, and photorecepetion. However, the worms lack eyes or eyespots. They have setae that curve at the tips, unlike those of related organisms.

Little is known about the life cycle of the ice worm; it is thought to be unusually slow. It requires temperatures of 0 °C for a successful reproduction. Cocoons are dispersed by birds. Not much is known about the ice worm&#x27;s diet, but it is thought to eat snow algae, as well as some bacteria.

==Habitat==
Ice worms inhabit glaciers and can be found in snowfields, avalanche cones, and glacier rivers and pools. These environments have temperatures near the freezing point and are nutrient poor. The organisms require permanent glacial environments for survival and reproduction.

As well as the northwestern United States, ice worms have been found in glaciers of southern Alaska and certain parts of British Columbia. They can be abundant, with typical densities of about 100 per square meter and peak recorded densities of up to 6,000 per square meter. Though they are found in snowfields, rivers and pools, they are not found on dirty snow or rock.

==Ecology and behavior==

&quot;M. solifugus&quot; have a very narrow acceptable temperature range. Their metabolisms have adapted to cold temperatures, and they are the only known worm to spend their entire life in temperatures near 0 C (32 °F), where they are most active and their ability to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is at its peak. They freeze at around −6.8 °C (19.8 °F), and their bodies decompose after continuous exposure to temperatures above 5 °C (41 °F). This decomposition process, known as autolysis, occurs when the cells produce digestive enzymes and self-destruct. The body, figuratively, melts.

Even if other places are equally cold, ice worms never venture onto any other terrain. They eat the abundant snow algae and pollen carried by the wind.

Ice worms are most active in late spring. In the summer, they follow a diurnal cycle—at the first light in the morning, they sink into the glacier. A few hours before sunset, they poke out from the snow. In this respect they resemble some other oligochaetes that avoid strong radiation but are attracted to dim light.

Little is known about the ice worm during the winter as the inaccessibility of glaciers prevents further study. Since in the winter the surface temperature on a glacier can reach −40 °C (−40 °F), the worms most likely remain below the surface. They may burrow as deep as several feet into the glacier in search of an area with a favorable temperature. The snowfall provides insulation, and the temperatures below remains a stable 0 C (32 °F). Ice worms can still find plenty of algae in the firn layer, the layer of packed snow in transition to ice.

In glacial ponds or small streams, ice worms can be found in broad daylight. The freezing water provides the worms with a comfortable temperature, countering any heating of their dark bodies from the sun. In fast-flowing glacial streams, ice worms cling to the ice surface. Researchers have observed the worms gyrating their heads in the stream, possibly catching algae and pollen carried by the water. In still ponds, ice worms gather in bundles. Researchers speculate this is reproductive behavior. Ice worms do not graze in groups on the surface, so the contact in still ponds provides the rare opportunity for breeding.

Ice worms move on the surface of ice at about 3 m/h (meters per hour) and move through snow by squeezing between the grains. Lateral movement is usually along the surface of the glacier and they penetrate the glacier vertically.

==Research studies and medical uses==
Researchers are investigating what prevents the worm from freezing at temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) and are looking at the evolutionary steps by which the ice worm diverged from related species. Understanding the ice worm&#x27;s physiology could suggest means by which to preserve organs for transplantation and could aid in the understanding of potential extraterrestrial life on cold planets, as well as species on Earth which survive in climates colder than previously thought possible.

<text>Robert Alan Morse (May 18, 1931 – April 20, 2022) was an American actor. Known for his gap-toothed boyishness, he started his career as a star on Broadway acting in musicals and plays before expanding into film and television. He earned numerous accolades including two Tony Awards, two Drama Desk Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. 

For his roles on Broadway, Morse won two Tony Awards; the first for Best Actor in a Musical for playing J. Pierrepont Finch in &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (1961), a role which he reprised in the 1967 film adaptation; the second for Best Actor in a Play for portraying Truman Capote in the one-man play &quot;Tru&quot; (1988), a role which he reprised in the 1992 television production, earning him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. Morse was also Tony-nominated for &quot;Say, Darling&quot; (1959), &quot;Take Me Along&quot; (1960), and &quot;Sugar&quot; (1973). Morse acted in his final stage role in the Broadway revival of the newspaper comedy &quot;The Front Page&quot; from 2016 to 2017. 

Morse acted in the films &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; (1958), &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963), and &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot; (1967). Known for his television roles, he played Robert Dickson in the ABC comedy series &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; from 1968 to 1969, for which he was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series. Morse attained a career resurgence playing Bertram Cooper in the critically acclaimed AMC period drama series &quot;Mad Men&quot; from 2007 to 2015. The role earned him nominations for five Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. He portrayed Dominick Dunne in the FX limited series &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Morse was born on May 18, 1931, in Newton, Massachusetts, the second child of May (Silver), a pianist, and Charles Morse, who worked at a record store and managed a theater chain. He was Jewish. He attended a number of different schools until finding his inspiration in Henry Lasker, a music teacher at Newton High School who, according to Morse, &quot;knew what I had burning in me and wanted to express&quot;. Upon graduation, he left home for New York City to fulfill his ambition of becoming an actor, joining his elder brother Richard who was already studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse. He received an uncredited role in &quot;The Proud and Profane&quot; (1956), a film starring William Holden and Deborah Kerr. Morse also served in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War aboard the USS &quot;Black&quot;.

==Career==
=== 1954–1967: Breakthrough and acclaim === 

Morse earned multiple nominations and wins for Tony, Drama Desk, and Emmy awards over a period of five decades. He appeared in musicals and plays on Broadway, as well as in films and television shows. Morse made his television debut in the CBS soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; in 1954. His first film role was uncredited in the romantic drama &quot;The Proud and Profane&quot; (1956). In 1955, he made his Broadway debut playing Barnaby Tucker in the Thornton Wilder comedic play &quot;The Matchmaker&quot;, a role which he reprised in the 1958 film of the same name directed by Joseph Anthony. Morse also played Bobby in the Otto Preminger directed drama film &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963). During this time, he took television roles in &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Play of the Week&quot;, and &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;. Morse returned to Broadway playing Ted Snow in the comedic show &quot;Say, Darling&quot;. Critic John Chapman of The New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, described Morse&#x27;s performance as being &quot;splendid&quot;. He would go on to receive a Theatre World Award, as well as his first Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play, losing to Charlie Ruggles in &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot;. 

The following year, he played Richard Miller in the musical &quot;Take Me Along&quot; (1959) based on the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot;. Morse acted alongside Jackie Gleason and Walter Pidgeon. For his role, Morse received his second Tony nomination, this time for Best Actor in a Musical.

Morse gained stardom for portraying the young 1960s New York City businessman J. Pierrepont Finch in the 1961 Broadway production, Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows musical, &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. The production earned raves with &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Howard Taubman, writing that Robert Morse played Finch &quot;with unfailing bravura and wit&quot;, pronouncing Finch, as portrayed by Morse, &quot;a rumpled, dimpled angel with a streak of Lucifer.&quot; The production received numerous accolades including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and seven Tony Awards. He went on to receive his third Tony Award nomination and first win for Best Actor in a Musical. Although he was not named on the award, he contributed to the Grammy Award-winning cast album.

He reprised the role in the 1967 film adaptation of the same name. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film adaptation, citing it as successfully re-creating &quot;just about everything that was conducive to the stage success.&quot; Crowther especially noted his performance, writing &quot;Seeing Mr. Morse in close-ups, as those wily expressions cross on his face and those wicked designs of Pal Joey gleam in his Horatio Alger-character eyes, is better than seeing him on the stage&quot;. In 1964, Morse co-starred in the comedy film &quot;Quick, Before It Melts&quot;. The following year, he appeared in the black comedy film &quot;The Loved One&quot;, a film based on the Evelyn Waugh novel of the same name which satirized the funeral business in Los Angeles, particularly Forest Lawn Cemetery. In 1967, he co-starred in Gene Kelly&#x27;s &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot;, opposite Walter Matthau, and in &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot;, which had been filmed two years previously.

=== 1968–2006: Established actor ===

In 1968, he appeared in the comedy &quot;Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?&quot; opposite Doris Day. That same year, he acted in the television series &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;, which attempted to blend the musical genre with a situation comedy centered on newlyweds &quot;Robert&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot; (played by E. J. Peaker). The series was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series. Additionally, he guest-starred on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. During this time, he also appeared in episodes of &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, and &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;.
Morse was in the original Broadway cast of &quot;Sugar&quot;, a 1972 musical stage adaptation of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. T.E. Killam of &quot;Time&quot; wrote of Morse&#x27;s performance, &quot;Morse captures the tremor, tenderness, coquettishness and vulnerability of a girl&#x27;s first love. Morse is an enormously personable stage presence, and he knows it.&quot; For the role, he won the Drama Desk Award and was again nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Morse joined other performers, including Marlo Thomas, in creating the 1972 &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot; children&#x27;s album. He provided the voice for the cartoon character Howler in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;. For Rankin/Bass, he voiced Jack in the 1979 animated special &quot;Jack Frost,&quot; as well as the main character Stuffy in &quot;The First Easter Rabbit&quot;. Morse appeared in dozens of TV shows, including &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;. 

He starred in the 1976 musical &quot;So Long, 174th Street&quot;, which was based on the play &quot;Enter Laughing&quot;. It received poor reviews and closed quickly, becoming Morse&#x27;s last Broadway role for more than a decade. In 1987, Morse appeared in the film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, which starred Sid Caesar and was part of the Cannon Movie Tales series. Morse made his return to Broadway portraying author and socialite Truman Capote in the one man show &quot;Tru&quot; (1989), earning rave reviews for his performance as well as the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show. In 1992, he recreated his &quot;Tru&quot; performance for the PBS series &quot;American Playhouse&quot; and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. In 1999, Morse was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame for his long career as a stage actor. 

During the 1990s, he also took on numerous voice roles in various animated shows such as &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;. In 2000, he acted in the CBS medical drama &quot;City of Angels&quot; playing Edwin O&#x27;Malley, acting alongside Blair Underwood, Vivica A. Fox, Viola Davis, and Maya Rudolph. In 2002, Morse was cast as the Wizard of Oz in the San Francisco run of the Stephen Schwartz musical &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Curran Theatre, and acted opposite Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Morse quit the show before its Broadway opening and was replaced by Joel Grey.

=== 2007–2019: &quot;Mad Men&quot; and return to Broadway ===
Beginning in 2007, Morse took on a recurring role in the critically acclaimed AMC dramatic series &quot;Mad Men&quot; as elder 1960s New York City businessman Bertram Cooper, a founding partner in the advertising agency Sterling Cooper. He was regularly nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series as a result of his performance in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. The series creator Matthew Weiner originally cast Morse in part because of his reputation on the stage, including his iconic role as social climber J. Pierrepont Finch in 1962’s &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. In his character&#x27;s final moments, he gets a song and dance number where he sings, &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot;. Morse said of the moment, &quot;It’s an absolute love letter from creator Matt Weiner. You couldn’t ask for a nicer send off.&quot;

In 2016, he played Walter Hoving in the comedic film &quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s The Art of the Deal: The Movie&quot;. Morse was cast as journalist Dominick Dunne who covered the 1994–1995 murder trial of O. J. Simpson for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in the critically acclaimed Ryan Murphy created limited series &quot;The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot; on FX. At the age of 85, Morse returned to Broadway in the 2016 revival of the newspaper comedy &quot;The Front Page&quot; acting alongside Nathan Lane, John Slattery, John Goodman, and Holland Taylor at the Broadhurst Theatre. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described his performance as &quot;delightful&quot;. He voiced Santa Claus in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; (2015-2021), and &quot;Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans&quot; (2019).

==Personal life and death==
Morse was married twice and had five children. He died at his home in Los Angeles, California, on April 20, 2022, at the age of 90.

<doc id="1128335" wikidata="Q4863186" url="?curid=1128335" title="Barracks communism">
<text>Barracks communism () is the term coined by Karl Marx to refer to a crude, authoritarian, forced collectivism and communism where all aspects of life are bureaucratically regimented and communal. Marx used the expression to criticise the vision of Sergey Nechayev outlined in &quot;The Fundamentals of the Future Social System&quot;. The term barracks here does not refer to military barracks, but to the workers&#x27; barracks-type primitive dormitories in which industrial workers lived in many places in the Russian Empire of the time. 

In the ideology of the Soviet Union the term was applied to theories of &quot;some ideologues in China&quot; of the 1950s-1970s. During the Soviet perestroika period, the term was used to apply to the history of the Soviet Union itself.

== Origin ==
A relevant section of Sergey Nechayev&#x27;s &quot;The Fundamentals of the Future Social System&quot; reads as follows: The ending of the existing social order and the renewal of life with the aid of the new principles can be accomplished only by concentrating all the means of social existence in the hands of our committee, and the proclamation of compulsory physical labour for everyone.

The committee, as soon as the present institutions have been overthrown, proclaims that everything is common property, orders the setting up of workers&#x27; societies (&quot;artels&quot;) and at the same time publishes statistical tables compiled by experts and pointing out what branches of labour are most needed in a certain locality and what branches may run into difficulties there.

For a certain number of days assigned for the revolutionary upheaval and the disorders that are bound to follow, each person must join one or another of these artels according to his own choice... All those who remain isolated and unattached to workers&#x27; groups without sufficient reason will have no right of access either to the communal eating places or to the communal dormitories, or to any other buildings assigned to meet the various needs of the brother-workers or that contain the goods and materials, the victuals or tools reserved for all members of the established workers&#x27; society; in a word, he who without sufficient reason has not joined an artel, will be left without means of subsistence. All the roads, all the means of communication will be closed to him; he will have no other alternative but work or death.

In their report &quot;The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men&#x27;s Association&quot;, an explanation and justification of the expulsion of Bakunin&#x27;s faction from the International, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels quote the above text and comment sarcastically as follows: What a beautiful model of barrack-room communism! Here you have it all: communal eating, communal sleeping, assessors and offices regulating education, production, consumption, in a word, all social activity, and to crown all, , anonymous and unknown to anyone, as the supreme director. This is indeed the purest anti-authoritarianism.

<text>CJFB-TV (channel 5) was a television station in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Canada. The station was in operation from 1957 to 2002 as a private affiliate of CBC Television.

==History==
The station signed on the air on December 23, 1957, beginning its schedule at 6 p.m., as a Christmas present to southern Saskatchewan. From start to finish, it was owned by Bill and Julie Forst and their company, Swift Current Telecasting.

Many baby boomers fondly remember &quot;Uncle Gord&#x27;s Cartoon Party&quot; which was broadcast in the 1960s and early 1970s. Hosted by longtime CJFB on-air personality Gordon Foth, the program was broadcast at noon on weekdays and featured cartoons such as &quot;Popeye&quot; which were elderly even then. However, in the one-channel environment of Southwestern Saskatchewan, the program was enjoyed by many school-aged children at home for lunch.

In 1958 a weekly live television program reporting developments in agriculture, called &quot;Farming Today&quot;, was sponsored jointly by the Swift Current Research Station, the Swift Current Agricultural and Exhibition Association, and CJFB. The program was hosted by research station personnel and/or the local provincial agricultural representative. Research Station Staff involved in the program included: Baden Campbell, Peder Myhr and Mark Kilcher. &quot;Farming Today&quot; lasted for 25 years.

In 1976, after fighting an application by Regina&#x27;s CKCK-TV to extend CTV service to Swift Current, CJFB agreed to a protective arrangement which allowed it to delete local advertising from the CKCK signal.

Towards the end of its life, the station also carried programming from Global, similar to CKRD-TV, and had produced one season of an agriculture series called &quot;Agribiz&quot; before the series relocated to Regina.

The Forsts did not have the resources to convert the station to digital, and opted to sell CJFB to the CBC in 2002. On May 31, CJFB signed off for the final time with a look back at the station&#x27;s history. The next day, the station&#x27;s main transmitter became CBKT-4, a semi-satellite of Regina&#x27;s CBKT, providing a full CBC schedule to the area. CJFB-TV-1 (Channel 2) in Eastend and CJFB-TV-2 (Channel 2) in Val Marie were deleted, as they were in range of two existing CBKT rebroadcasters, CBCP-TV-1 (channel 7) in Shaunavon and CBCP-TV-3 (channel 3) in Ponteix, respectively. CITV-TV provides Global programming via local cable systems. CJFB&#x27;s demise marked it the first television station in Canada to cease operations since 1991, and also the first television station of the 2000s in Canada to cease operations. CBC affiliates CKOS-TV in Yorkton and CKBI-TV in Prince Albert would also be sold to the CBC in 2002, also becoming CBKT semi-satellites. CBKT-4 was among 620 rebroadcasters closed down by the CBC on July 31, 2012, due to budget cuts affecting the network.

==Transmitters==
* CBCP-TV-1 7 Shaunavon
* CBCP-TV-2 2 Cypress Hills/Eastend/Val Marie

<text>Sirsoe methanicola is a species of polychaete worm that inhabits methane clathrate deposits in the ocean floor. The worms colonize the methane ice and appear to survive by gleaning bacteria, which in turn metabolize the clathrate.

In 1997, Charles Fisher, professor of biology at Pennsylvania State University, discovered the worm living on mounds of methane ice at a depth of half a mile (~800 m) on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Mexico. Fisher reported that experiments with live specimens showed that mature worms could survive in an anoxic environment for up to 96 hours. The experiments also showed that the larvae were dispersed by currents, and died after 20 days if they did not find a place to feed.

The worm has been found to be able to utilize a range of nitrogen, sulfur, and organic carbon compounds through microbial taxa. These taxa allow the worm to take advantage of the harsh environment by allowing it to feed and gain nutrition through organic compounds that are found in the methane clathrate deposits.

<text>Living Under June is the second album by the Canadian singer-songwriter Jann Arden, released in 1994.

&quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot;, &quot;Insensitive&quot; and &quot;Good Mother&quot; were all significant hits for Jann in Canada, with &quot;Wonderdrug&quot;, &quot;Unloved&quot; and &quot;Looking for It (Finding Heaven)&quot; also becoming Canadian adult-contemporary hits. &quot;Insensitive&quot; was Jann&#x27;s biggest hit internationally, entering the Top 40 in several countries, including Italy and the United States ( 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100). In the U.S., &quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot; was also a minor adult contemporary chart hit (No. 33). Total worldwide sales for this album come to 1.3 million, with 600,000 Canadian, and 500,000 US.

The video for &quot;Good Mother&quot;, directed by Jeth Weinrich, won the Juno Award for Video of the Year at the 1996 Juno Awards. Weinrich also directed the video for &quot;Insensitive&quot;, which was a nominee for the same award, but didn&#x27;t win, at the 1995 Juno Awards.

==Production==
The album was produced by Ed Cherney and Arden. Most of the songs were written in a Calgary basement, where Jann lived under her landlady, June. Jackson Browne duets with Jann on &quot;Unloved&quot;. Anne Loree wrote &quot;Insensitive&quot;. Kenny Aronoff played drums on the album.

<doc id="1128397" wikidata="Q1147132" url="?curid=1128397" title="Punch Broadbent">
<text>Harold Lawton &quot;Harry&quot; &quot;Punch&quot; Broadbent (July 13, 1892 – March 5, 1971) was a Canadian ice hockey player. Broadbent played for the Ottawa Senators, Montreal Maroons and the New York Americans in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and National Hockey League (NHL) between 1912 and 1929. Broadbent won the Stanley Cup four times during his career, three times with Ottawa and once with Montreal. He is regarded as one of the first true power forwards in NHL history. For this reason, he was known in his day as &quot;Old Elbows&quot;. 

In the 1921-22 NHL season, Broadbent scored at least one goal in 16 consecutive games from December 16, 1921 to February 15, 1922, an NHL record that remains unbroken over a century later.

==Personal life==
Born in Ottawa, Ontario. Broadbent married Leda Fitzsimmons and had one daughter, Sally Ann Broadbent. In the summer of 1915 Broadbent enlisted in the Canadian military to serve in the First World War. He served in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, and was promoted to Bombardier in October 1916. In March 1918 he was awarded the Military Medal for his service in the war. Broadbent&#x27;s only brother Spencer was killed in action during the war. 

A January 27, 1934 article on Broadbent in the Montreal Gazette by D. A. L. MacDonald says he was called &quot;Punch&quot; because of his round chubby face which would puff up like a Billiken charm doll when he smiled.

Broadbent died on March 5, 1971 at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife Leda, daughter Sally Ann and four grandchildren. He was interred at Beechwood Cemetery.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Broadbent played ice hockey at Percy Street School, then starred for Ottawa Cliffsides and New Edinburgh in the Ottawa City League and Inter-provincial League. At age 20, he made his professional debut with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association (NHA) on December 28, 1912 against Quebec, scoring the first goal of his career. Broadbent played the 1912–13 season on a line with Jack Darragh. He was seventh in the league in scoring his rookie year, and while hobbled with injuries the next, was fourth in scoring the following year. He scored three goals in the Stanley Cup Finals against the Vancouver Millionaires in 1915 before going to the war for three and one-half years.

Broadbent returned from the war in January 1919, and played the remaining eight games of the season for the Senators, now in the National Hockey League (NHL). With forwards Frank Nighbor and Cy Denneny, he starred for the Senators for six more seasons, playing for three Stanley Cup champions. Though he was a holdout for most of the 1921 season, Broadbent came back to win the league scoring title in 1922, with 32 goals in 24 games. He also set a record that season by scoring goals in sixteen consecutive games. The streak began during a 10–0 rout of the Montreal Canadiens on December 24 and lasted through to a 6–6 tie with Canadiens on February 15, and it included a stretch of six straight multi-goal games.

After the 1924 playoffs, teammate Clint Benedict and Broadbent were blamed for the playoff loss and sold by Ottawa to the expansion Montreal Maroons. Broadbent was the Maroons&#x27; leading scorer that first season, including a five-goal game against the Hamilton Tigers. In his second season with the Maroons, the team won its first Stanley Cup championship against the Ottawa Senators. He was traded back to the Senators in 1928 with cash for Hooley Smith. He played for the New York Americans in 1929 and retired after that season.

Broadbent finished his career with 172 goals and 58 assists in 360 professional games. After his playing career, he coached for several years in the Ottawa City Hockey League, winning the championship in 1933 with the Ottawa Rideaus. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962.

<doc id="1128398" wikidata="Q5031395" url="?curid=1128398" title="Cancer Alley">
<text>Cancer Alley is the regional nickname given to an stretch of land along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, in the River Parishes of Louisiana, which contains over 200 petrochemical plants and refineries. This area accounts for 25% of the petrochemical production in the United States. Environmentalists consider the region a sacrifice zone where rates of cancer caused by air pollution exceed the federal government&#x27;s own limits of acceptable risk.

Community leaders such as Sharon Lavigne have led the charge in protesting the expansion of the petrochemical industry in Cancer Alley, as well as addressing the associated racial and economic disparities.

Cancer Alley in a larger sense extends further west along the Gulf Coast into Texas to the area of Freeport, Texas.
==History==

Following an oil and gas boom around the time of World War II, a number of refineries spawned along the Mississippi River near the Gulf Coast. Many of these facilities were previously located in major population centers, such as Baton Rouge and New Orleans, but during the 1950s, many sought to migrate to less densely populated places. Many relocated to the small communities along the river between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, many of which had significant or majority African American populations. By the 1970s, the area had a proliferation of plants producing vinyl chloride, nitrogen fertilizers, and chlorine. By the 1970s, serious air pollution and water pollution was noted by federal agencies. An EPA report found 66 pollutants in New Orleans drinking water, and 31 lethal chemicals in the air of Plaquemine. In 1976, Coast Guard divers retrieving sediment samples from a bayou suffered second-degree burns on their hands. By the early 1980s, residents in the neighborhood of Good Hope had grown accustomed to regular fires at a local oil refinery, and developed their own informal evacuation plans for their occurrences. Despite the known problems with pollution, the petrochemical industry in the area continued unabated, and even continued expanding. In the early 1980s, an oil refinery purchased the land of Good Hope for expansion.

Beginning in the 1980s, locals also perceived certain species of plants and animals becoming less common. By 1988, locals began referring to an area in Chalmette as &quot;Cancer Alley&quot;. The &quot;alley&quot; later grew to encompass an eighty-five-mile stretch along the Mississippi River stretching from New Orleans to Baton Rouge and includes the parishes of East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Ascension, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines.

Industrial plants emitting toxic waste in Louisiana continued to proliferate in the 21st century. According to EPA data, the number of industrial plants in Louisiana that reported their toxic releases grew from 255 to 320 from 1988 to 2017, an increase of 25%, even as the number of such plants nationwide dropped by 16% over that period.

Per a 2003 study that surveyed 11 plants in St. James Parish, researchers found that the plants employed between 4.9% and 19.4% African Americans, which is low in comparison to the overall population of the county (49.2% in 2000).

In 1969, DuPont opened a plant to manufacture the chemical chloroprene, the main ingredient in neoprene, in Reserve, Louisiana on the border with LaPlace, Louisiana. The plant was sold in 2015 to Japanese chemical company Denka. The area immediately adjacent to the Denka/DuPont neoprene plant in St. John the Baptist Parish has been recognized by the EPA as having a likelihood of its residents getting cancer from air pollution over 700 times the national average. According to EPA, it emits 99% of the nation&#x27;s chloroprene pollution. EPA opened civil rights investigations over this pollution from Cancer Alley.

==Community organizing==
In 1996, Shintech Inc. announced that they would be creating three new polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing plants in Convent, a small majority Black community (2010 population of 711, 65.7% Black) that serves as the parish seat of St. James Parish. The state of Louisiana issued Shintech permits to proceed with the project in 1997, despite their acknowledgement that these locations would be adding 623,000 pounds of pollutants to the air annually. The residents of Convent formed a coalition called St. James Citizens for the Environment (SJCJE) that drew the attention of outside legal groups including the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic and the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. In 1998, after considerable pressure and lobbying, Shintech withdrew its project plans.

In 1992, when the Taiwanese-owned Formosa Plastics Corporation proposed to build a $700 million rayon and pulp processing plant in Wallace, a small majority Black community (2000 population of 570, 93.7% Black) in St. John the Baptist Parish, which would have been the world&#x27;s largest if completed and was expected to create 5,000 jobs, the 750 residents of the town waged a legal battle and eventually won forcing Formosa to build their plant elsewhere.

In 2018, the Formosa Plastics Corporation proposed the Sunshine Project, a $9.4 billion industrial complex to be located on the west bank of St. James Parish that is estimated to become the petrochemical and plastics project with the single greatest environmental detriment, at an estimated 13,628,086 tons of greenhouse gas emissions yearly. The proposed complex would span 2,500 acres and will be situated one mile from an elementary school, On January 15, 2020, RISE St. James, a faith-based grassroots organization of St. James Parish community members, in conjunction with the nonprofit conservation organization Center for Biological Diversity, the grassroots organization Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and the nonprofit Healthy Gulf, sued the Trump administration for permitting Formosa Plastics&#x27; proposed petrochemical complex. The lawsuit sought to invalidate the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; fast-tracked Clean Water Act permits that the Corps issued the prior year. It had come to light that independent archaeologists that Formosa Plastics hired had discovered that enslaved people were buried in unmarked graves beneath the 2,300-acre site that Formosa planned to develop their plastics complex on. Citing violation of federal laws in the approval of destroying wetlands, the region&#x27;s first and quickly dwindling line of defense against progressively-intensifying natural disasters, as well as the failure to protect the water, air, and health of the surrounding communities, and the violation of the National Historic Preservation Act in failing to protect the burial grounds of enslaved people, the lawsuit demanded the rescinding of the permits issued in September 2019 as well as the conducting of a full environmental impact study. On November 4, 2020, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced its plans to suspend its permit for the Sunshine Project.

While developments by Formosa Plastics Corporation in St. James Parish remain to be monitored, the multigenerational disenfranchisement and exploitation of Black people and people of Color are difficult to ignore. &quot;One oppressive economy begets another,&quot; says Barbara L. Allen on the subject, a professor of science, technology, and society at Virginia Tech. She continues, &quot;The Great River Road was built on the bodies of enslaved Black people. The chemical corridor is responsible for the body burden of their descendants.&quot; Her words are particularly poignant in relation to the economic stimulation and job creation that is promised with the proposal of each new plant in the area, while a tiny minority of full-time industry jobs are actually filled by community members who bear the brunt of the pollution burden – for example, in St. Gabriel of Iberville Parish where there are now 30 large petrochemical plants within a 10-mile radius, only 9% of the full-time industry jobs in the city are held by local residents, and at least one in four residents live in poverty. The promised economic prosperity in these major investments has never yet to be delivered, yet continues to be a cited reason for the continued approval of petrochemical permits.

== Criticism ==

The EPA, in both 2016 and 2020, reported that those residing in Cancer Alley are exposed to more than 10 times “the level of health risk from hazardous air pollutants” than other residents in the state. Human Rights Watch reviewed data from 12 fossil fuel and petrochemical plants operating in the Cancer Alley area from October 2020 to November 2023. Out of these 12 facilities, only one of them was “reported in compliance with all three federal laws” in the 3-year observational period. Only 2 of these facilities “were in compliance with the Clean Water Act” as well.

On January 27, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order regarding environmental justice and specifically cited Cancer Alley as a hard-hit area. Louisiana Chemical Association President Greg Bowser responded to President Biden&#x27;s remarks on the region, refuting claims that residents of the industrial corridor have a higher risk of developing cancer in multiple articles. Furthermore, he cited Louisiana Tumor Registry (LTR) data to support his claims. The LTR claims that there has not been an increase in cancer deaths connected to industrial pollution.

On March 2, 2021, the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee discussed the continued industrial projects along the Mississippi River in Louisiana. The UN council on contemporary racism strongly condemned what they defined as environmental racism in their discussion with experts and other UN officials:This form of environmental racism poses serious and disproportionate threats to the enjoyment of several human rights of its largely African American residents, including the right to equality and non-discrimination, the right to life, the right to health, right to an adequate standard of living and cultural rights.The sentiments stated by environmental activists were echoed by the Human Rights Commission.

As of 2019 activists and locals have disputed the conclusions of the Louisiana Tumor Registry asserting the tracts used cover large areas and the data does not allow for specific locations adjacent to chemical plants to be analyzed individually. They also posited that the data may be incomplete as those who died during the COVID-19 pandemic who also had cancer might not be included. In 2008, Louisiana health officials were unable to release the specific cases and data because of medical privacy laws.

==Government action==
The EPA&#x27;s National Air Toxic Assessment looked at toxic emissions around the nation in 2011 and released the findings in 2015. The study found that the air in LaPlace, Louisiana, which is an area in Cancer Alley, had a higher-than-expected level of chloroprene. This subsequently caused the EPA to begin working closely with the owner of the neoprene plant in the area, Denka Performance Elastomer, and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to lower chloroprene emissions. The overall goal was to lower chloroprene emissions by 85%.

The state of Louisiana says that Denka has reached the goal of lowering emissions by 85%, but some residents remain skeptical. Many residents believe that instead of reducing emissions by a percentage, the emissions should be 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter of air, which is what is considered a safe level by the EPA.

In April 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency initiated civil rights investigations of Louisiana state agencies. The probe focused on whether the process of granting permits along the industrial corridor violated the civil rights of residents who live nearby. The probe specifically examined the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Department of Health regarding the permitting of a Denka Performance Elastomers plant, as well as a proposed Formosa Plastics Sunshine plant and a proposed Greenfield Exports grain terminal.

In February 2023, the EPA and prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office for the Eastern District of Louisiana filed a complaint against Denka Performance Elastomer under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act. The complaint asserted that the company&#x27;s LaPlace, Louisiana, plant posed an imminent danger to public health based on its emissions of cancer-causing chloroprene. Air monitoring near the Denka plant found chloroprene levels as high as 14 times the recommended level.

According to the EPA, air monitoring performed near Denka&#x27;s plant has shown that chloroprene levels are as high as 14 times the recommended level of 0.2 μg/m3, which poses &quot;an imminent and substantial endangerment&quot; to nearby communities. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry sued the EPA, challenging the government&#x27;s use of the disparate impact standard of the Civil Rights Act, which says policies cannot cause disproportionate harm to people of color and continue greenlighting industrial activities in an area already overburdened by pollution. Five weeks later, the EPA dropped its Cancer Alley investigation. In February 2024, the EPA requested a delay in an impending federal trial against Denka until after the agency finalized a rule expected to tighten emission limits for chloroprene.

In April 2024, the EPA announced a new rule targeting more than 200 chemical plants across the U.S., requiring them to cut enough toxic emissions to reduce cancer risks for people living in those areas by 96 percent. It marked the first time the EPA had amended national emissions standards for hazardous organic pollutants in more than 30 years. The new rule requires plants to locate the source of toxic contamination and make repairs when emissions exceed standards. The plants are also required to install air monitors at their fence lines.

==Environmental racism==

Many scholars and residents of Cancer Alley have referred to the area as a &quot;frontline example of environmental racism&quot;. Environmental racism can be defined as the institutional rules, regulations, policies, or government/corporate decisions that deliberately target certain communities for locally undesirable land uses and lax enforcement of zoning and environmental laws, resulting in communities being disproportionately exposed to toxic and hazardous waste based on race. Environmental racism can also be caused by several factors. These factors include intentional neglect, the alleged need for a receptacle for pollutants in urban areas, and a lack of institutional power and low land values of people of color. It is also a well-documented and well-known fact that communities of color and low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by polluting industries and lax regulation of these industries. 75% of Black Americans are reported to more likely live in communities dubbed as &quot;fence-line&quot;, communities in close proximities to sites of pollution and industry. Over 1 million of Black Americans are reported to live within a half-mile radius of oil and gas wells.

Another reason for the disproportionate siting of industrial facilities in poor and Black communities is the “Not In My Backyard Movement” (NIMBY). Primarily White neighborhoods rallied together against the petrochemical companies that were being placed in their communities. As a result, these companies shifted their sights and locations towards poor communities of color. NIMBY’s growth occurred in the 1970’s at the same time public awareness about health risks related to pollution from these waste facilities grew. These White communities had social power and “clout” that low-income communities of color did not have.  

==Environmental impacts==
The location of Cancer Alley also poses more environmental impacts other than air pollution. Since Cancer Alley is located closer to the Gulf of Mexico, hurricanes pose a great risk and have caused large amounts of damage in past years. For example, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused almost 11 million gallons of oil to spill into the water near New Orleans. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 caused power outages that led to unrefrigerated chemicals in a plant in Houston decomposing and igniting into a large fireball. In 2020, Hurricane Laura caused a fire at a plant that produced pool chemicals, which led to chlorine gas being burned for three days.

One of the largest environmental impacts happened when Hurricane Ida hit in 2021. The storm&#x27;s projected path was through the industrial region. The threat of the hurricane&#x27;s destruction caused the industries located in Cancer Alley to release unprocessed chemicals and gases into the air via &quot;flaring.&quot; Even though flaring causes chemicals to be released into the air, the process is legal in emergencies and burns the chemicals directly into the air. After the hurricane, residents were not only left with damaged homes but also more pollution in the air and water than usual.

==Activism and environmental justice==
In recent years in the United States, the environmental protection and civil rights movements have merged to form an environmental justice movement in response to minority and low-income communities throughout the country being constantly threatened by pollution. Many communities that face the largest burdens from pollution tend to be poor and consist mainly of minorities. Due to this, poor and minority communities will resort to grassroots activism to protect themselves. Many have also cited the EPA&#x27;s failure to be consistent in their enforcement of federal environmental laws.

In September 2022, environmental justice advocates in southern Louisiana were able to declare victory after two decisions denied two major petrochemical complexes from moving forward. State District Court Judge Trudy White released a decision that reversed and vacated 14 air regulations permits that the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) had issued for the proposed Formosa Plastics Group complex in the town of Welcome. The town already has multiple oil refineries and industrial plants and is located in Cancer Alley.

Another group that has been actively fighting against the petrochemical industry in Cancer Alley is Rise St. James. Rise St. James is a faith-based grassroots organization that fights for environmental justice and works to defeat the proliferation of petrochemical industries in St. James Parish, Louisiana. The organization successfully defeated the construction of a $1.25 billion plastics manufacturing plant in 2019 and is currently fighting to prevent Formosa Plastics from building a multibillion-dollar plant in the parish. Rise St. James is also committed to educating the community and those outside of the community about the chemicals they breathe in every day. The organization&#x27;s website includes a &quot;Chemical of the Month&quot; page and provides information on a specific chemical and how much it is found in certain areas of Cancer Alley.

==In popular culture==
British industrial metal band Godflesh used a photograph of a cemetery located in Cancer Alley as the cover art for their 1996 album, &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot;.

Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild discusses the environmental and health conditions in Cancer Alley, as well as the socioeconomic and political ramifications, in her 2016 book &quot;Strangers in Their Own Land.&quot;

<text>Antonio Pigafetta (; – c. 1531) was a Venetian scholar and explorer. In 1519, he joined the Spanish expedition to the Spice Islands led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the world&#x27;s first circumnavigation, and is best known for being the chronicler of the voyage. During the expedition, he served as Magellan&#x27;s assistant until Magellan&#x27;s death in the Philippine Islands, and kept an accurate journal, which later assisted him in translating the Cebuano language. It is the first recorded document concerning the language.

Pigafetta was one of the 18 men who made the complete trip, returning to Spain in 1522, under the command of Juan Sebastián Elcano, out of the approximately 240 who set out three years earlier. These men completed the first circumnavigation of the world while others mutinied and returned in the first year. Pigafetta&#x27;s surviving journal is the source for much of what is known about Magellan and Elcano&#x27;s voyage.

==Early life==
Pigafetta was born to a prominent noble family in the city of Vicenza in northeast Italy. Recent archival research indicates that his father was Giovanni Pigafetta and his mother was a noblewoman named Lucia, daughter of Marco Muzan. The couple was married in March 1492, implying that Antonio was born sometime after that date. Details of his education are unknown but he later boasted of having &quot;read many books&quot;.

There is a tradition that as a youth Pigafetta sailed the Mediterranean with the Knights of Rhodes but there is no record of such activity, only the observation that he later became a member of the order. At some point he entered into the service of papal ambassador Francesco Chiericati, an apostolic protonotary and a close associate of Pope Leo X. Like Pigafetta, Chiericati was also from Vicenza. In 1518, Leo X sent Chiericati to the royal court in Spain to serve as ambassador. Pigafetta accompanied the ambassador&#x27;s retinue, first to Zaragoza for two months and then to Barcelona.

==Voyage around the world==
While in Spain, Pigafetta heard of Magellan&#x27;s planned expedition to find a western route to the Spice Islands. The adventure appealed to him and he convinced Chiericati that his participation on this historic voyage would be advantageous for the Vatican. With the approval of the papal ambassador and King Charles, Pigafetta was provided with letters of introduction before he set out for Seville in May 1519. Magellan accepted his application to join the expedition and hired him for a modest monthly salary of 1,000 maravedís. He was enrolled under the name Antonio Lombardo and his position was described as one of the &quot;servants of the captain and supernumeraries&quot;.

When the expedition set sail in August 1519, Pigafetta was assigned to the flagship &quot;Trinidad&quot; where he served Magellan and became his great admirer. Pigafetta did not appear to have any specific role except to keep a daily record of his observations, a task that he undertook with great diligence. He recorded extensive information concerning the geography, climate, and natural history of the places visited by the expedition. He was especially interested in the native inhabitants encountered along the way and took meticulous notes on their appearance, social customs and languages. In contrast to the accuracy of his personal observations, he had a tendency to accept even the most outrageous tales told to him about the lands they visited.

Pigafetta was wounded on Mactan in the Philippines, where Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in April 1521. Nevertheless, he recovered and was among the 18 who accompanied Juan Sebastián Elcano on board the &quot;Victoria&quot; on the return voyage to Spain.

==Return==
Upon reaching port in Sanlúcar de Barrameda in the modern Province of Cadiz in September 1522, three years after his departure, Pigafetta returned to the Republic of Venice. He related his experiences in the &quot;Report on the First Voyage Around the World&quot; (), which was composed in Italian and was distributed to European monarchs in handwritten form before it was eventually published by Italian historian Giovanni Battista Ramusio in 1550–59. The account centers on the events in the Mariana Islands and the Philippines, although it included several maps of other areas as well, including the first known use of the word &quot;Pacific Ocean&quot; (&quot;Oceano Pacifico&quot;) on a map. The original document was not preserved.

However, it was not through Pigafetta&#x27;s writings that Europeans first learned of the circumnavigation of the globe. Rather, it was through an account written by a Flanders-based writer, Maximilianus Transylvanus, which was published in 1523. Transylvanus had been instructed to interview some of the survivors of the voyage when Magellan&#x27;s surviving ship, &quot;Victoria&quot;, returned to Spain in September 1522 under the command of Juan Sebastian Elcano. After Magellan and Elcano&#x27;s voyage, Pigafetta utilized the connections he had made prior to the voyage with the Knights of Rhodes to achieve membership in the order.

== The &quot;Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo&quot; ==

Antonio Pigafetta also wrote a book, in which a detailed account of the voyage was given.

Although the text is written in semi-chronological order, it does not read as a linear history of the voyage. Rather, it is a collection of descriptions, events, translations of foreign languages, thoughts, and illustrations. The resulting work is therefore described as being unusually personal for the times.

It is unclear when it was first published and what language had been used in the first edition, given that the original text was lost, though it is believed that it might have been written in the author&#x27;s Venetian dialect, mixed with Spanish and Italian. The remaining sources of his voyage were extensively studied by Italian archivist Andrea da Mosto, who wrote a critical study of Pigafetta&#x27;s book in 1898 (&quot;Il primo viaggio intorno al globo di Antonio Pigafetta e le sue regole sull&#x27;arte del navigare&quot;) and whose conclusions were later confirmed by J. Dénucé.

Today, three printed books and four manuscripts survive. One of the three books is in French, while the remaining two are in the Italian language. Of the four manuscripts, three are in French (two stored in the Bibliothèque nationale de France and one in Cheltenham), and one in Italian.

From a philological point of view, the French editions seem to derive from an Italian original version, while the remaining Italian editions seem to derive from a French original version. Because of this, it remains quite unclear whether the original version of Pigafetta&#x27;s manuscript was in French or Italian, though it was probably in Italian. The most complete manuscript, and the one that is supposed to be more closely related to the original manuscript, is the one found by Carlo Amoretti inside the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan and published in 1800 (&quot;Primo viaggio intorno al globo terraqueo, ossia ragguaglio della navigazione alle Indie Orientali per la via d&#x27;Occidente fatta dal cavaliere Antonio Pigafetta patrizio vicentino, sulla squadra del capitano Magaglianes negli anni 1519-1522&quot;). Unfortunately, Amoretti, in his printed edition, modified many words and sentences whose meaning was uncertain (the original manuscript contained many words in Veneto dialect and some Spanish words). The modified version published by Amoretti was then translated into other languages carrying into them Amoretti&#x27;s edits. Andrea da Mosto critically analyzed the original version stored in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana and published this rigorous version of Pigafetta&#x27;s book in 1894.

Regarding the French versions of Pigafetta&#x27;s book, J. Dénucé extensively studied them and published a critical edition.

At the end of his book, Pigafetta stated that he had given a copy to Charles V. Pigafetta&#x27;s close friend, Francesco Chiericati, also stated that he had received a copy and it is thought that the regent of France may have received a copy of the latter. It has been argued that the copy Pigafetta had provided may have been merely a short version or a draft. It was in response to a request, in January 1523, of the Marquis of Mantua that Pigafetta wrote his detailed account of the voyage.

== Recognition ==
An exhibition on Pigafetta opened in 2019 in Madrid at the library of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID).

The Italian destroyer Antonio Pigafetta, of the &quot;Navigatori&quot; class, was named after him in 1931.

<doc id="1128429" wikidata="Q5128011" url="?curid=1128429" title="Class analysis">
<text>Class analysis is research in sociology, politics and economics from the point of view of the stratification of the society into dynamic classes. It implies that there is no universal or uniform social outlook, rather that there are fundamental conflicts that exist inherent to how society is currently organized. The most well-known examples are the theories of Karl Marx and Max Weber&#x27;s three-component theory of stratification.

==Barrington Moore and political development==
In a non-Marxist sense, class analysis is a theory of political development, in which political regimes and systems are said to be shaped by the social class structure of the country. The main advocate for this theory is political scientist Barrington Moore Jr. In Moore&#x27;s theory, Great Britain gradually attained a stable democratic governance, compared to neighboring countries such as France and Germany, due to the rapid displacement of peasantry during the enclosure movement which fully transformed Britain into an advanced, industrial society with a strong bourgeois class, which Moore sees as indispensable for a lasting liberal democracy. In contrast, France had a large peasantry that is stationary on land yet politically volatile, leading to the alternating between violent revolutions and monarchical reactions.

==Class size==
Sociologist Erik Olin Wright splits class analysis into macro and micro levels. The foundation of class analysis on a macro level can be identified with class structure. Examples of such class structure in a macro level can be analyzed within a firm, city, country, or the entire world. On a micro level, class analysis focuses on the effects that the class may have on an individual. Erik Olin Wright exclaims examples of this to be: &quot;Analyses of labor market strategies of unskilled workers, or the effects of technological change on class consciousness, or political contributions of corporate executives&quot;. Macro and micro level events can correlate with one another through different perspectives. Wright proclaims that macro level events are not created and set on one large effect, but instead processed through multiple individuals in a very intricate and complex pattern. He dictates that macro class size events are endorsed by an embodiment of multiple micro class events. He also states the opposite effect each size has on each other and how Micro level events relative to class relations can be reinforced by the context of macro level events.

==Neo-Weberian definition==
According to sociologist Richard Breen, Weberian class analysis is limited. Weber largely focused on unequal opportunities in life, which he attributed to the initial distributions of resources within a capitalist market. Breen argues that Weber did little to address class conflict or even the development of collective action on a class level. Breen further writes, &quot;For many reasons, there is not a deterministic relationship between the resources that individuals bring to the market and what they receive in return.&quot;

Breen cites sociologist Aage B. Sørensen&#x27;s (1991) writings on class analysis, which described class positions as independent of who occupies such positions. From this, Breen describes that the purpose of class analysis is how and on what basis class positions are determined, rather than Weber&#x27;s market-determined approach. Weberian class analysis also did not account for the influence of class beyond life chances, such as behaviours, actions, and preferences.

==Class differentials in educational attainment and their explanation==
Sociologist John Goldthorpe explains that while educational attainment in developed countries has risen in the last decades due to endorsements of grants, loans and other social motivations, empirical data substantiates that the differentials in social-economic class still plays a major role in educational and economic attainment. He goes on to explain how people of lower social class tend to stay in the class of their upbringing by choosing to not pursue further educational attainment or the works needed to attain a better social status. Explanations for these phenomena include theories by Halsey and her associates, which state the connection between culture and class, how people of high social class or paramount culture set a more important objective on education compared to parents of lower classes. According to Goldthorpe, a more aggressive approach, as indicated by Bourdieu and Passeron, indicates that the educational system functions as a social control, in which dominant class enforce that schools run in a conservative manner and exploit the inequalities that come with every child due to their family&#x27;s class background. This will ensure subjects of lower class status to accept failure or indulge in counter-school subcultures. Goldthorpe, however, states that in the last century there has truly been extensive opportunities for upward educational and class mobility defended by means of empirical data.

Other theories proposed by different sociologists arise as well. One view claimed by Keller and Zavalloni indicate that to better understand these trends, sociologists must study the aspirations of an individual on a relative level according to their social level and situation and not conclude absolute ideals of aspirations to all the classes, which would be easier to work with. Goldthorpe also acknowledges Boudon&#x27;s two-effect view in educational attainment. Those stand as the primary effects, which exist as the creation of class differentials in initial achievement, and second effects that affect children when they transition in the educational system. They both work hand in hand were although initial achievement might pursue an individual as they develop in the educational system (Primary), choosing whether to transition into the next level in the system might still be influenced by their class origins (second). Goldthorpe goes on to encourage researchers to enforce further attention to the second effect, because as we progress, even today, the limitations of the primary effects seem to be vanishing as more educational attainment resources and opportunities are being funneled into all class levels.

==Class and political partnership==
Goldthorpe describes how class influence on an individual&#x27;s social situation is diminishing substantially in the world of politics. This evidently described by Sociologist M. Lipset during the latter half of the 20th century were liberal democratic working class advocated for their party to represent their problems In the 1950s but quickly diminished during the 1970s as class relations in political partnership was dissolving. This is particularly important, as some Marxist social groups state this to be the downfall of the working class and class analysis. Another example of this dissolution of political and class partnership is Britain&#x27;s politics; in how political party conflicts tended to focus more on issues instead of interest of the class community. This in turn creates family-party separation which fuels different political party interest. Heath and his associates have theorized the dissolution of this partnership to be derivative of absolute and relative rates in class voting and social mobility. These theories develop through the class development of Britain during the latter half of the 20th centuries by implication of &quot;trends in patterns of class mobility, in levels of class identification, and in class differences in political attitudes and values&quot;. Heath and his colleagues try to argue empirically against theories of Dunleavy and associates who stated that new structural cleavages were becoming the foundations for party support. On top of empirical support against, Goldthorpe explains that fluidity and boundaries are the major point against the theories of Dunleavy and his colleagues.

==Class interest==
According to Erik Olin Wright, class interests &quot;[...] are the material interests of people derived from their location-within-class-relations&quot; (p. 21), which include living standards, working conditions, intensity of labor, leisure, material security, and more. These interests are specifically &quot;class&quot; interests because one&#x27;s class location significantly influences the &quot;opportunities and trade-offs&quot; one can make. Class interests can also serve as a &quot;theoretical bridge between the description of class relations and the actions of individuals within those relations&quot; (p. 21).

<doc id="1128438" wikidata="Q151841" url="?curid=1128438" title="Tākaka">
<text>Tākaka is a small town situated at the southeastern end of Golden Bay, at the northern end of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, located on the lower reaches of the Tākaka River. State Highway 60 runs through Takaka and follows the river valley before climbing over Tākaka Hill, to Motueka (57 km away) linking Golden Bay with the more populated coast of Tasman Bay to the southeast. The town is served by Tākaka Aerodrome.

==History==
The area has long had Māori settlement. An early nation is Ngāti Tumatakōkiri, then Ngāti Apa and today the iwi are known as Manawhenua ki Mohua Ngāti Tama, Ngāti Rarua and Te Āti Awa, these nations (iwi) migrating from the North Island in the 1820s.

The name of the town may derive from Taha&#x27;a island in the Society Islands in French Polynesia. A local myth about a taniwha in the nearby Parapara River is similar to one told about the Parapara strait, which separates Taha&#x27;a from Motue&#x27;a island.

From 1853 to 1876, Tākaka was administered as part of the Nelson Province. Sawmilling was an important business for Tākaka in the 1870s. The Takaka tramway was built in 1880. Prior to that time timber was transported to the port by teams of bullocks which would often leave the main street of Tākaka looking like a rutted bog. After flooding in 1904 did significant damage to the tramway, it was sold in 1905 and the locomotive, rolling stock and rails were shipped to Onehunga by sea.

Tākaka contributed soldiers to the Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War with 1, 44 and 25 respectively dying in each conflict.

Onetahua Kokiri Marae (Manawhenua ki Mohua) in Pohara Valley was established in 1986, used a re-purposed school in 1992 and in 2001 a meeting house named &quot;Te Ao Marama&quot; was opened. The name comes from the name for Farewell Spit. Te Ātiawa te Waka a Māui state that &quot;Onetahua connects ancestrally to the waka Tokomaru, the maunga Parapara and the awa Waikoropupu&quot;.

In June 2005, much of the town was temporarily evacuated after fire swept through Tākaka&#x27;s biggest industrial complex, a dairy factory. There were fears that volatile chemicals stored at the plant might explode, leading to the release of poisonous gases, which later proved to be unfounded.

In July 2020, the name of the town was officially gazetted as Tākaka by the New Zealand Geographic Board.

==Geography==

The area around Tākaka Hill is dominated by its karst geology. This creates sinkholes and cave systems, including New Zealand&#x27;s deepest vertical shaft, Harwoods Hole. Lake Killarney in Tākaka is a sinkhole filled with groundwater.

Tākaka and Golden Bay are known for rock climbing, particularly around the area of Paines Ford.

The town is also known for Te Waikoropupū Springs (colloquially known as Pupu Springs).

The antipode of Tākaka is the town of Coriscada, Portugal.

==Climate==
Tākaka is one of the warmest locations in the South Island, due to its northerly position and maritime influences from the Golden Bay.
Because of the hills in the Kahurangi National Park to the south-west of Tākaka, the town receives substantially less rainfall than the West Coast. Tākaka&#x27;s location on the leeward side of these hills allow the wind to become warmer and drier as it flows down towards the town, allowing an average of 22 days a year to exceed 26.7 °C (80 °F). On the contrary, being a few kilometres inland, cold air can settle over Tākaka on winter mornings, resulting in an average of 17.2 frosty days per year.

==Economy==
Farming, sawmilling, limestone quarrying and tourism are major local industries. The area around Tākaka is mineral-rich, with gold, iron ore, copper, silver and asbestos all found locally, although not all in commercially viable amounts.

=== Dairy factory ===

There is also a small Fonterra factory located in the township of Tākaka that produces skim milk powder. There are 83 dairy farms supplying the factory, which can process about a day into skim milk powder. Cream is produced as a by-product, and is shipped to the Clandeboye factory for further processing. The $80 million Takaka dairy factory was damaged by a fire in 2005. More than 60 firefighters battled the fire, which was caused by contractors completing welding work. It has subsequently been rebuilt. In 2009, it was reported that it employed nearly 50 staff and contributed $3 million in wages to the local economy.

== Demographics ==
Tākaka covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Tākaka had a population of 1,335 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 99 people (8.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 183 people (15.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 552 households, comprising 657 males and 678 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.97 males per female. The median age was 47.0 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 222 people (16.6%) aged under 15 years, 189 (14.2%) aged 15 to 29, 621 (46.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 306 (22.9%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 94.8% European/Pākehā, 10.8% Māori, 1.1% Pasifika, 2.0% Asian, and 2.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 18.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 64.5% had no religion, 24.9% were Christian, 0.2% were Hindu, 1.1% were Buddhist and 1.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 177 (15.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 243 (21.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $24,800, compared with $31,800 nationally. 90 people (8.1%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 483 (43.4%) people were employed full-time, 219 (19.7%) were part-time, and 27 (2.4%) were unemployed.

==Education==

There are two primary schools for Year 1 to 6 students: Tākaka Primary School, with a roll of , and Central Takaka School with a roll of .

There is also a primary school in nearby Motupipi.

==Features==

=== Golden Bay Museum – Te Waka Huia o Mohua ===

The Golden Bay Museum – Te Waka Huia o Mohua has displays on Abel Tasman&#x27;s 1642 encounter with Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri (the local Māori tribe), Golden Bay&#x27;s industrial past, and a pilot whale skeleton. It opened in 1990 after a fundraising effort by the community purchased the collections of the privately owned Takaka Museum. The current museum is owned and funded by Tasman District Council and operated by the Golden Bay Museum Society Inc.

=== Labyrinth Rocks Park ===

The Labyrinth Rocks Park is located on Scott Road. It is a natural rock maze. Shaped by the chemistry of rainfall and rock, it is a part of the Takaka Hill karst landscape of sculptured rocks, corrugated walls and vertical clefts. Narrow passages lead to small groves of native bush or to another passage or to a dead end, but the maze is too small to get lost in. Doll figurines and toy dinosaurs poked into crevices add to the labyrinth&#x27;s fairytale Jurassic Park experience. Founded by an English geologist, Dave Whittaker, it is now a public reserve. Entrance is free.

=== Paines Ford swimming hole and rock climbing ===

Paines Ford (also known as Paynes Ford) is a swimming hole and rock climbing spot on the confluence of the Waingara and Takaka rivers. An easy trail from the carpark follows the route of a tramline, that existed to haul timber out of the surrounding forest in the early 1880s, to a number of swimming holes surrounded by limestone rock formations. The entrance and carpark is located at 1886 Takaka Valley, Highway SH60, which is south of central Takaka. Alternatively, it is about a 20 minutes walk from Tākaka. Paines Ford has over 200 bolted climbs. The most famous climb is &quot;1080 and the letter G&quot; because of its unique &quot;no-hands-rest&quot; at the top and its views of Golden Bay.

== Notable buildings ==

=== Masonic lodge ===

The Masonic lodge was originally built as a cinema in 1926 outside the town boundary, as for reasons unknown, a cinema was not permitted in the town. It was a popular addition to the town before being sold in 1937 and became the Masonic lodge. The Collingwood Lodge and the Takaka Lodge merged in 1972 became the Golden Bay Lodge No 144.

=== Golden Bay theatre ===
The Golden Bay theatre was opened in May 1927. Electricity became available in 1929 with a petrol engine used prior to this to provide power. When television arrived, theatre numbers declined and it was used for other public functions. In 1978 it was converted into a cafe and art gallery.
=== Bank of New Zealand ===

The Bank of New Zealand first engaged in business in Tākaka in 1884 based in a local hotel. The bank moved into the premises pictured in 1915. The building was built out of reinforced concrete supplied by the Golden Bay Cement Company. Gas lighting was initially used and this was replaced with electric lighting in 1930. The bank survived the Murchison earthquake of 1929 without any structural damage. In 1983 floods entered the bank but did little damage. The building is currently used as an art gallery.

=== Golden Bay Electricity Board building ===

On this site in Commercial Street was originally a blacksmith. In 1929, the Golden Bay Electricity Board opened the building and occupied it until 2000. It is now occupied by the Department of Conservation.

=== Telegraph Hotel ===

The Telegraph Hotel was built over 100 years ago.

=== Church of the Epiphany ===

The Anglican church of the Epiphany is situated on Commercial Street. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Nelson in 1884. It was built from locally sawn matai and totara timber. A bell tower was added in 1900 and by 1960 the timber was covered in stucco. The bell tower was replaced in 1966 and the church was extended in 2002.

=== Sacred Heart Catholic Church ===

The Church of the Sacred Heart was designed by Nelson architect Arthur Griffin, and built at a cost of £1250 using locally sourced marble. It was formally opened on 15 September 1918. The church requires structural strengthening to bring it up to the building code requirements and has not been used since 2011.

=== St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church ===

St Andrew&#x27;s is located on Commercial Street, Tākaka.

=== Eureka boarding house ===

The Eureka boarding house was built in 1906. A milk bar was added to the front of the building in the 1950s. It has since been modified further to provide more shop frontage.

== Golf course ==
The Takaka Golf Club had a number of homes on local farms before shifting to Crown land at Clifton that was able to be rented for a token amount in perpetuity in 1959.

<text>The Mother is a 2003 British drama film directed by Roger Michell and written by Hanif Kureishi. It stars Anne Reid, Daniel Craig, Peter Vaughan, Steven Mackintosh, and Cathryn Bradshaw.

The film had its world premiere at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival in the Directors Fortnight section.

==Plot==
May is a woman from Northern England. Her life has been constrained by the expectations of society and her husband. When her husband dies during a visit to their adult children in London, she has a chance to start again and pursue her love of drawing.

May is quiet but when her son Bobby tries to make her sit down and have a cup of tea she refuses, saying she might never get up and that she won&#x27;t become invisible like all the neighbouring grandmothers and widows. May returns to London with Bobby to the horror of Helen, Bobby&#x27;s wife.

May initiates a sexual affair with Darren, a warm and attractive younger man who is renovating Bobby and Helen&#x27;s house and who is also her daughter Paula&#x27;s boyfriend. Paula says he is a sweet man but weak. He has a wife and autistic son but lives in his van outside their house. Darren appears to share May&#x27;s interest in art and the unlikely pair form an understanding.

May moves from Bobby&#x27;s house to Paula&#x27;s and discovers Paula is having therapy because her mother didn&#x27;t cuddle her enough. At a writing group organised by Paula, May writes a short account of being a depressed mother of two young children. It is a very public explanation, perhaps, for her lack of affection. Paula introduces her mother to Bruce, a man near May&#x27;s age. Paula wants her mother to find out if Darren will leave his wife and what he thinks of her. May agrees, but can only avoid Paula&#x27;s later questions.

Paula stumbles upon a sketchbook filled with May&#x27;s drawings of a naked man and a woman performing fellatio on him. She surmises the man is Darren, and shows the sketches to Bobby. He says it must be a fantasy but Paula suspects her mother is having an affair with Darren, and is angry.

After sex with May, Darren helps himself to medication in Helen&#x27;s bathroom cabinet without caring what they are. May offers to pay for him to travel, with her, but then seeing his reluctant response says, &#x27;what a silly idea&#x27;.

Paula invites her mother and Bruce on a double date with herself and Darren. May leaves when Paula makes a show of kissing Darren, and Bruce pursues her. He takes her home and rapes her. May goes to Paula&#x27;s but finds no comfort as Paula is pleased to think her mother and Bruce were probably intimate. Paula tells May that she has given Darren an ultimatum to leave his wife by the following day, and, expecting that he will, tells May that she must leave.

Bobby tells Darren he must finish the conservatory or leave as he has a deadline and wants to sell the house. Darren is disillusioned and frustrated by his life and his lack of autonomy and fights with May, seeking to assert himself by making May perform fellatio on him. May wants to please Darren but is reluctant because he is being rough and aggressive. Things only become worse when May reveals that the financial &quot;help&quot; she had earlier promised him would be a plane ticket, to allow them to travel together, rather than cash as he had been anticipating. Darren loses his temper and insults her, before proceeding to smash up the conservatory he had been working on for Bobby.

Later, Paula tells her mother that what might make her feel better would be to hit her. May agrees and Paula punches May in the face, calling her a whοrе. They visit Bobby&#x27;s house where Helen is showing an estate agent round, and Darren is busy repairing the conservatory with Bobby. May has a black eye that she explains as an argument and says she &#x27;got the message&#x27;, before saying goodbye to everyone, refusing a lift to the station and preferring to leave alone.

May returns home, but only long enough to collect her passport, before walking away with her suitcase, sketchbooks and passport in hand.

==Production==
Anne Reid revealed that she was so anxious at the prospect of filming sex scenes with Daniel Craig that on the night before the scenes were to be filmed, she got drunk and then burst into tears. Said Reid, &quot;I rang my son and I was weeping and he said, ‘Look Mum, it’s a great part, if you’re inhibited it’s not going to work so just go for it&#x27;&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Mother&quot; has a score of 78% based on 91 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Reid gives a fearless, realistic performance in depicting an older woman&#x27;s sexual blossoming.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 72 based on 27 reviews.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Reid &quot;achingly believable&quot; and said Craig brings an &quot;undertone of volatile macho arrogance seething below a cultivated surface&quot;. Holden opined &quot;The Mother&quot; is better than Roger Michell&#x27;s two best-known films, &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and &quot;Changing Lanes&quot;, and that &quot;screenwriter Hanif Kureishi&#x27;s even-handed view of the characters&#x27; frustrations and fantasies is infused with an unwavering Chekhovian compassion&quot;. With its centring on an older woman and a younger man, the film also received comparisons to Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four and praised the performances of Reid, Craig, and Bradshaw. He concluded, &quot;By the end, &quot;&#x27;The Mother&quot;&#x27; has told us all we need to know about the characters, except how to feel about them. It shows how people play a role and grow comfortable with it, and how that role is confused with the real person inside. And then it shows the person inside, frightened and pitiful and fighting for survival. I have a lot of questions about what happens in this movie. I am intended to.&quot;

Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was more critical. Though he lauded Reid and Craig&#x27;s performances as well as the film&#x27;s opening sequence, he called the film a &quot;contrived and self-important drama&quot;. The film&#x27;s third act was also criticised as descending into melodrama.

Filmmaker John Waters named the film one of the ten best of 2004.

<doc id="1128448" wikidata="Q2389090" url="?curid=1128448" title="Tākaka Hill">
<text>Tākaka Hill, previously also referred to as Marble Mountain, is a range of hills in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. Made of marble that has weathered into many strange forms and with numerous sink holes, it is typical karst country. The marble is Ordovician in age and from the Takaka Terrane.

There is only one road winding over and around the flanks of Tākaka Hill, State Highway 60, following the valleys of the Tākaka River to the northwest and the Riuwaka River to the southeast. In July 2020, the name of the pass was officially gazetted as Tākaka Hill Saddle by the New Zealand Geographic Board.

It rises to 791 metres at its highest point and separates the coastal communities of Golden Bay from those of the more populous Tasman Bay to the southeast and because of its winding nature isolates Golden Bay from the rest of the South Island.

Tākaka Hill is notable for its (now defunct) marble quarry and for many limestone caves and sinkholes, including Ngarua Caves which are open to the public and feature deposits of moa bones. Harwood&#x27;s Hole, at one time the deepest cave in New Zealand, is also to be found on Tākaka Hill.

Many of the caves drain into &quot;The Resurgence&quot;, a spring at the foot of the hill.

Labyrinth Rock Park, near Tākaka township, is an accessible natural rock maze of sculptured rocks, corrugated walls and vertical clefts.

Tākaka Hill, as many other areas in and around the Golden Bay, has also been the location for many scenes filmed for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

In geometry, a square pyramid is a pyramid with a square base and four triangles, having a total of five faces. If the apex of the pyramid is directly above the center of the square, it is a &quot;right square pyramid&quot; with four isosceles triangles; otherwise, it is an &quot;oblique square pyramid&quot;. When all of the pyramid&#x27;s edges are equal in length, its triangles are all equilateral. It is called an &quot;equilateral square pyramid&quot;, an example of a Johnson solid.

Square pyramids have appeared throughout the history of architecture, with examples being Egyptian pyramids and many other similar buildings. They also occur in chemistry in square pyramidal molecular structures. Square pyramids are often used in the construction of other polyhedra. Many mathematicians in ancient times discovered the formula for the volume of a square pyramid with different approaches.

== Special cases ==
=== Right square pyramid ===
A square pyramid has five vertices, eight edges, and five faces. One face, called the &quot;base&quot; of the pyramid, is a square; the four other faces are triangles. Four of the edges make up the square by connecting its four vertices. The other four edges are known as the lateral edges of the pyramid; they meet at the fifth vertex, called the apex. If the pyramid&#x27;s apex lies on a line erected perpendicularly from the center of the square, it is called a &quot;right square pyramid&quot;, and the four triangular faces are isosceles triangles. Otherwise, the pyramid has two or more non-isosceles triangular faces and is called an &quot;oblique square pyramid&quot;.

The &quot;slant height&quot; formula_2 of a right square pyramid is defined as the height of one of its isosceles triangles. It can be obtained via the Pythagorean theorem:
formula_3
where formula_4 is the length of the triangle&#x27;s base, also one of the square&#x27;s edges, and formula_5 is the length of the triangle&#x27;s legs, which are lateral edges of the pyramid. The height formula_6 of a right square pyramid can be similarly obtained, with a substitution of the slant height formula giving:
formula_7
A polyhedron&#x27;s surface area is the sum of the areas of its faces. The surface area formula_8 of a right square pyramid can be expressed as formula_9, where formula_10 and formula_11 are the areas of one of its triangles and its base, respectively. The area of a triangle is half of the product of its base and side, with the area of a square being the length of the side squared. This gives the expression:
formula_12
In general, the volume formula_13 of a pyramid is equal to one-third of the area of its base multiplied by its height. Expressed in a formula for a square pyramid, this is:
formula_14

Many mathematicians have discovered the formula for calculating the volume of a square pyramid in ancient times. In the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, Egyptian mathematicians demonstrated knowledge of the formula for calculating the volume of a truncated square pyramid, suggesting that they were also acquainted with the volume of a square pyramid, but it is unknown how the formula was derived. Beyond the discovery of the volume of a square pyramid, the problem of finding the slope and height of a square pyramid can be found in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. The Babylonian mathematicians also considered the volume of a frustum, but gave an incorrect formula for it. One Chinese mathematician Liu Hui also discovered the volume by the method of dissecting a rectangular solid into pieces.

=== Equilateral square pyramid ===

If all triangular edges are of equal length, the four triangles are equilateral, and the pyramid&#x27;s faces are all regular polygons, it is an &quot;equilateral square pyramid.&quot; The dihedral angles between adjacent triangular faces are formula_15, and that between the base and each triangular face being half of that, formula_16. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is called a Johnson solid. The equilateral square pyramid is among them, enumerated as the first Johnson solid formula_17.

Because its edges are all equal in length (that is, formula_18), its slant, height, surface area, and volume can be derived by substituting the formulas of a right square pyramid:
formula_19

Like other right pyramids with a regular polygon as a base, a right square pyramid has pyramidal symmetry. For the square pyramid, this is the symmetry of cyclic group formula_20: the pyramid is left invariant by rotations of one-, two-, and three-quarters of a full turn around its axis of symmetry, the line connecting the apex to the center of the base; and is also mirror symmetric relative to any perpendicular plane passing through a bisector of the base. It can be represented as the wheel graph formula_21, meaning its skeleton can be interpreted as a square in which its four vertices connects a vertex in the center called the universal vertex. It is self-dual, meaning its dual polyhedron is the square pyramid itself.

An equilateral square pyramid is an elementary polyhedron. This means it cannot be separated by a plane to create two small convex polyhedrons with regular faces.

== Applications ==

In architecture, the pyramids built in ancient Egypt are examples of buildings shaped like square pyramids. Pyramidologists have put forward various suggestions for the design of the Great Pyramid of Giza, including a theory based on the Kepler triangle and the golden ratio. However, modern scholars favor descriptions using integer ratios, as being more consistent with the knowledge of Egyptian mathematics and proportion. The Mesoamerican pyramids are also ancient pyramidal buildings similar to the Egyptian; they differ in having flat tops and stairs ascending their faces. Modern buildings whose designs imitate the Egyptian pyramids include the Louvre Pyramid and the casino hotel Luxor Las Vegas.

In stereochemistry, an atom cluster can have a square pyramidal geometry. A square pyramidal molecule has a main-group element with one active lone pair, which can be described by a model that predicts the geometry of molecules known as VSEPR theory. Examples of molecules with this structure include chlorine pentafluoride, bromine pentafluoride, and iodine pentafluoride.

The base of a square pyramid can be attached to a square face of another polyhedron to construct new polyhedra, an example of augmentation. For example, a tetrakis hexahedron can be constructed by attaching the base of an equilateral square pyramid onto each face of a cube. Attaching prisms or antiprisms to pyramids is known as elongation or gyroelongation, respectively. Some of the other Johnson solids can be constructed by either augmenting square pyramids or augmenting other shapes with square pyramids: elongated square pyramid formula_22, gyroelongated square pyramid formula_23, elongated square bipyramid formula_24, gyroelongated square bipyramid formula_25, augmented triangular prism formula_26, biaugmented triangular prism formula_27, triaugmented triangular prism formula_28, augmented pentagonal prism formula_29, biaugmented pentagonal prism formula_30, augmented hexagonal prism formula_31, parabiaugmented hexagonal prism formula_32, metabiaugmented hexagonal prism formula_33, triaugmented hexagonal prism formula_34, and augmented sphenocorona formula_35.

<doc id="1128456" wikidata="Q580897" url="?curid=1128456" title="Boeing XB-39 Superfortress">
<text>The Boeing XB-39 Superfortress was a United States prototype bomber aircraft, a single example of the B-29 Superfortress converted to fly with alternative powerplants. It was intended to demonstrate that the B-29 could still be put into service even if the first choice of engine, the air-cooled Wright R-3350 radial engine, ran into development or production difficulties.

==Design and development==
Starting life as the first YB-29 delivered to the United States Army Air Forces, it was sent in November 1943 to the Fisher Body Aircraft Development Section of General Motors to be converted to use Allison V-3420-17 liquid-cooled W24 (twin-V12, common crankcase) inline engines. Fisher was chosen for the modification as it was familiar with the engine, as it was to power the P-75 Eagle that they were then developing. Testing on it began in early 1944.

Further development of the engine and the aircraft was delayed by a series of changes in the planned turbosuperchargers, as the originally specified GE Type CM-2 two-stage turbosupercharger became unavailable due to demands on GE&#x27;s production of its other turbosuperchargers. Other turbosuperchargers were considered, but the result was that the first flights of the XB-39 had to be made without any turbosuperchargers at all.

==Operational history==
Fisher finally focused again on the B-39. The first flight of the B-39 was made on 9 December 1944 at Cleveland, Ohio. The initial flight tests of the B-39, without turbosuperchargers installed, were impressive. However, the B-39 program was by now seriously delayed, and the flawed R-3350 B-29s had already been rushed into combat in June 1944.

Despite continuing problems with the B-29s, the aircraft was functioning well enough in combat that it no longer made any sense to shift resources in the manufacturing base to a new engine for the B-29 and so the B-39 was not ordered into production.

<text>The Northern and Central Bitterroot Range, collectively the Bitterroot Mountains (Salish: čkʷlkʷqin), is the largest portion of the Bitterroot Range, part of the Rocky Mountains and Idaho Batholith, located in the panhandle of Idaho and westernmost Montana in the northwestern United States. The mountains encompass an area of 4,862 square miles (12,593 km2).

The mountains are bordered on the north by Lolo Creek, to the northeast by the Clark Fork, on the south by the Salmon River, on the east by the Bitterroot River and Valley, and on the west by the Selway and Lochsa Rivers. Its highest summit is Trapper Peak, at .

== Northern Bitterroot Range ==

The Northern Bitterroot Range is the northernmost and shortest subrange of the Bitterroot Mountains. The Northern Bitterroots encompass 1,869 square miles (4,841 km2) and its two tallest peaks are the 7,930 foot (2,417 m) Rhodes Peak and the 7,770 foot (2,368 m) Quartz Benchmark.

The Northern Bitterroots also contain a smaller subrange, the Grave Creek Range. The Grave Creek Range is 262 square miles (679 km2) in area and its highest peak is the 7,270 foot (2,216 m) Petty Mountain.

== Central Bitterroot Range ==

The Central Bitterroot Range is the southernmost and tallest subrange of the Bitterroot Mountains. The Central Bitterroots encompass 2,993 square miles (7,752 km2) and its two tallest peaks are the 10,157 foot (3,096 m) Trapper Peak and the 9,983 foot (3,043 m) El Capitan.

The Central Bitterroots also contain a smaller subrange, the Como Peaks. The Como Peaks subrange is 79 square miles (205 km2) in area and its highest peak is the aforementioned El Capitan.

==History==
The Bitterroot Mountains presented an unexpected, formidable obstacle to Lewis and Clark during their expedition westward, and ended their expectation of finding a &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; giving an easy connection from the Atlantic watershed to that of the Pacific.

===Forest management===
Guy M. Brandborg of the U.S. Forest Service, was supervisor of the Bitterroot National Forest from 1935 to 1955. By insisting on selection cutting, he tried to protect the watersheds and wildlife habitats that are harmed by clear-cutting. After he retired in 1955 Brandborg denounced the Forest Service for deviating from his model. He launched a public attack and lobbied to secure passage of the National Forest Management Act of 1976, that codified his model.

In geometry, a pentagonal pyramid is a pyramid with a pentagon base and five triangular faces, having a total of six faces. It is categorized as a Johnson solid if all of the edges are equal in length, forming equilateral triangular faces and a regular pentagonal base.

Pentagonal pyramids occur as pieces and tools in the construction of many polyhedra. They also appear in the field of natural science, as in stereochemistry where the shape can be described as the pentagonal pyramidal molecular geometry, as well as the study of shell assembling in the underlying potential energy surfaces and disclination in fivelings and related shapes such as pyramidal copper and other metal nanowires.

== Properties ==
A pentagonal pyramid has six vertices, ten edges, and six faces. One of its faces is pentagon, a &quot;base&quot; of the pyramid; five others are triangles. Five of the edges make up the pentagon by connecting its five vertices, and the other five edges are known as the lateral edges of the pyramid, meeting at the sixth vertex called the apex. A pentagonal pyramid is said to be &quot;regular&quot; if its base is circumscribed in a circle that forms a regular pentagon, and it is said to be &quot;right&quot; if its altitude is erected perpendicularly to the base&#x27;s center.

Like other right pyramids with a regular polygon as a base, this pyramid has pyramidal symmetry of cyclic group formula_2: the pyramid is left invariant by rotations of one, two, three, four-fifths around its axis of symmetry, the line connecting the apex to the center of the base. It is also mirror symmetric relative to any perpendicular plane passing through a bisector of the base. It can be represented as the wheel graph formula_3, meaning its skeleton can be interpreted as a pentagon in which its five vertices connects a vertex in the center called the universal vertex. It is self-dual, meaning its dual polyhedron is the pentagonal pyramid itself.
When all edges are equal in length, the five triangular faces are equilateral and the base is a regular pentagon. Because this pyramid remains convex and all of its faces are regular polygons, it is classified as the second Johnson solid formula_4. The dihedral angle between two adjacent triangular faces is approximately 138.19° and that between the triangular face and the base is 37.37°. It is an elementary polyhedron, meaning that it cannot be separated by a plane to create two small convex polyhedrons with regular faces. A polyhedron&#x27;s surface area is the sum of the areas of its faces. Therefore, the surface area of a pentagonal pyramid is the sum of the areas of the five triangles and the one pentagon. The volume of every pyramid equals one-third of the area of its base multiplied by its height. So, the volume of a pentagonal pyramid is one-third of the product of the height and a pentagonal pyramid&#x27;s area. In the case of Johnson solid with edge length formula_5, its surface area formula_6 and volume formula_7 are:
formula_8

== Applications ==

Pentagonal pyramids can be found as components of many polyhedrons. Attaching its base to the pentagonal face of another polyhedron is an example of the construction process known as augmentation, and attaching it to prisms or antiprisms is known as elongation or gyroelongation, respectively. Examples of polyhedrons are the pentakis dodecahedron is constructed from the dodecahedron by attaching the base of pentagonal pyramids onto each pentagonal face, small stellated dodecahedron is constructed from a regular dodecahedron stellated by pentagonal pyramids, and a regular icosahedron constructed from a pentagonal antiprism by attaching two pentagonal pyramids onto its pentagonal bases. Some Johnson solids are constructed by either augmenting pentagonal pyramids or augmenting other shapes with pentagonal pyramids: an elongated pentagonal pyramid formula_9, a gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid formula_10, a pentagonal bipyramid formula_11, an elongated pentagonal bipyramid formula_12, an augmented dodecahedron formula_13, a parabiaugmented dodecahedron formula_14, a metabiaugmented dodecahedron formula_15, and a triaugmented dodecahedron formula_16. Relatedly, the removal of a pentagonal pyramid from polyhedra is an example of a technique known as diminishment; the metabidiminished icosahedron formula_17 and tridiminished icosahedron formula_18 are the examples in which their constructions begin by removing pentagonal pyramids from a regular icosahedron.

In stereochemistry, an atom cluster can have a pentagonal pyramidal geometry. This molecule has a main-group element with one active lone pair of electrons, which can be described by a model that predicts the geometry of molecules known as VSEPR theory. An example of a molecule with this structure is nido-cage carbonate CB5H9.

 modeled the formation of virus shells, known as capsids, from pieces shaped like pentagonal and hexagonal pyramids. These shapes were chosen to resemble those of the protein subunits of natural viruses. By appropriately choosing the attractive and repulsive forces between pyramids, they found that the pyramids could self-assemble into icosahedral shells reminiscent of those found in nature.

 studied the relaxation of internal elastic stress fields due to disclinations in twinned copper particles. Such a shape is the pentagonal pyramid, which allows growth to a large size and preserves symmetry. This can be done by activating cathode by the process of initial crystal growth in the electrolyte, by the movement of aluminum and silicon oxides&#x27; abrasive particles.

<doc id="1128463" wikidata="Q77009" url="?curid=1128463" title="Paparazzi (2004 film)">
<text>Paparazzi is a 2004 American action thriller film directed by Paul Abascal, produced by Mel Gibson, and starring Cole Hauser, Robin Tunney, Dennis Farina, Daniel Baldwin and Tom Sizemore.

The film chronicles the life of popular Hollywood film star Bo Laramie in the aftermath of a car crash caused by four paparazzo tabloid photographers. Bo soon goes on a quest to get revenge on the gang for almost killing him and his family.

&quot;Paparazzi&quot; was released on September 3, 2004 in the United States to a critical and commercial failure.

==Plot==
Rising Hollywood movie star Bo Laramie finally achieves major success with his latest film &quot;Adrenaline Force&quot;. After the film&#x27;s premiere, a persistent group of unscrupulous photographers—Kevin Rosner, Leonard Clark, Wendell Stokes and their leader Rex Harper—harass Bo and his wife Abby, along with their 8-year-old son Zach. When Bo takes Zach to soccer practice, he eyes Rex taking photos of Zach and confronts him, leading Rex to provoke Bo into punching him, caught on camera by his fellow photographers. Bo is sued as a result and is placed into anger management. Meanwhile, Rex vows to destroy Bo and those close to him.

As Bo, Abby and Zach return from an event, Rex and his crew drive up beside them, in four different vehicles, and blind them by taking pictures. Bo&#x27;s car is hit by a pickup truck while Rex and his crew snap photos of the wreck they caused. While Bo is not seriously injured, Abby&#x27;s spleen is removed and Zach is placed in a coma.

Bo is told by LAPD detective Burton that the paparazzi each gave him the same story of finding the wreck after it happened, with no witnesses to dispute their claims. Some time later, Bo accidentally causes Kevin to wipe out on his motorcycle, careening onto a precipice. Bo tries to save him, but when Kevin gloats that they&#x27;ll put his family through hell, Bo lets him fall to his death.
Bo makes Leonard his next target, secretly placing a prop gun in the jacket left in Leonard&#x27;s car, whilst Leonard invades Bo&#x27;s movie set and is ejected by security. Following him, Bo calls 911, and describes Leonard&#x27;s car, saying that the driver is waving a gun. Leonard is pulled over and, reaching into his jacket for his ID, instead pulls out the prop gun, causing the cops to shoot him dead.

Convinced Bo will target them next, Rex and Wendell break into Bo&#x27;s house to plant cameras inside. Abby runs into Wendell, who assaults her and threatens to kill Zach if she tells the police. Burton assigns Deputy Walker and Deputy Wilson to provide extra security, but Bo sneaks out past the two deputies and into Wendell&#x27;s house, discovering the feed from the cameras.

Wendell arrives at his home where Bo confronts him with a baseball bat. In the morning, Bo puts the car back where it was at, and races to beat Burton, on his way to the house. Burton shows Bo a video taken by a camera in a button of Leonard&#x27;s shirt on the movie set, and thinks someone planted the gun in Leonard&#x27;s coat. Rex soon finds Wendell beaten to death, and Bo planted the bat in Rex&#x27;s houseboat to frame him.

Burton realizes traffic camera footage will prove what really happened at Bo&#x27;s crash, along with the testimony of Emily, who was with Rex at the event, prompted by her guilt to come forward. At Wendell&#x27;s house, Burton notices the video feed from the cameras in Bo&#x27;s house and Rex entering with a gun. Rex goes to Bo and Abby&#x27;s bedroom and opens fire, only for Bo to hit Rex and throw him to the floor.

Bo viciously beats Rex, gloating about how he got his revenge. Rex is finally arrested by Burton, adding to a charge that he had previously harassed and raped Emily, and a charge of killing Wendell. As Rex is led away, he&#x27;s the one who&#x27;s being relentlessly photographed by paparazzi. One of them even asks Rex if he killed Kevin. Bo is enjoying watching the paparazzi give Rex a taste of his own medicine. With that, Rex and his crew are out of the lives of Bo and his family.

Later, as Bo is finishing filming, he&#x27;s called to the hospital, where Zach has awakened from his coma. Bo, Abby and Zach later attend at the premiere of Bo&#x27;s newest film, a sequel to &quot;Adrenaline Force&quot;, and Abby is now pregnant with a girl. After the film, Bo meets the press out front, taking a paparazzi&#x27;s jibe at him in his stride.

==Cast==
* Cole Hauser as Bo Laramie
* Robin Tunney as Abby Laramie, Bo&#x27;s wife.
* Dennis Farina as Detective Burton
* Daniel Baldwin as Wendell Stokes
* Tom Hollander as Leonard Clark
* Kevin Gage as Kevin Rosner
* Blake Michael Bryan as Zach Laramie, Bo and Abby&#x27;s 8-year-old son.
* Tom Sizemore as Rex Harper
* Forry Smith as Deputy Walker
* Donal Gibson as Deputy Wilson

Mel Gibson, who was one of the film&#x27;s producers, appears as an anger management patient in the waiting room of their shared therapist. In addition, Chris Rock appears as a pizza delivery driver, Vince Vaughn appears as Bo Laramie&#x27;s co-star, and Matthew McConaughey appears as himself at a movie premiere.

At about forty minutes into the movie, Detective Burton (Dennis Farina) tells Bo how one of the paparazzi, Wendell Stokes, has previously sued &quot;Alec Baldwin&quot; or one of the &quot;Baldwins&quot;. Daniel Baldwin plays paparazzi Stokes in the movie (see Baldwin brothers).

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a box office bomb, having cost about US$20 million to be made, and grossing only $16 million worldwide.

* United States Domestic Gross: US$ 15,714,234
* International Gross: US$891,529 
* Total Worldwide Gross: US$16,605,763

===Critical response===
The film holds an 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with a consensus of being &quot;a crude, ludicrous exploitation movie with a questionable moral&quot;.

The film also received a large amount of negative criticism from major American, Canadian and British publications:
*&quot;Amazingly arrogant, immoral film.&quot; -- Dave Kehr, &quot;The New York Times&quot;
*&quot;The audacity of the paparazzi is a good topic, but this imbecilic film has no idea how to focus its intentions.&quot; -- E! Online
*&quot;First-time director Paul Abascal is an ex-hairdresser whose debut film wallows in melodramatic excesses - tense, shrieking music, spitting, sputtering villains and a hero who is right and righteous because, well, he&#x27;s a celebrity! And even celebrities have vengeance fantasies!&quot;—Roger Moore, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;
*&quot;Especially since the death of Princess Diana, guerilla photographers who snap celebrity candids have come to be considered the gum on the bottom of society&#x27;s shoe. The film &quot;Paparazzi&quot; exploits this built-in audience disgust to characterize them as somewhere between slugs and dung beetles on the morality scale, deserving whatever they get.&quot;—Derek Armstrong, Allmovie
*&quot;The martyr is action star Bo Laramie (Cole Hauser, playing the role as if he were slipped Rohypnol in a drink and forced to be in this movie!).&quot;—Jim Slotek, &quot;Jam!&quot;
*&quot;[Bo] takes the paparazzi out with extreme prejudice, for which he is investigated by a Columbo-esque cop who not-so-secretly approves of this old school justice. It&#x27;s just so embarrassing you wish the cinema would fit swivel seats so you can look round at the back wall when he comes on. The movie damns all paparazzi as parasitical villains.&quot; -- Peter Bradshaw, &quot;The Guardian&quot;

<text>In geometry, the triangular cupola is the cupola with hexagon as its base and triangle as its top. If the edges are equal in length, the triangular cupola is the Johnson solid. It can be seen as half a cuboctahedron. The triangular cupola can be applied to construct many polyhedrons.

== Properties ==
The triangular cupola has 4 triangles, 3 squares, and 1 hexagon as their faces; the hexagon is the base and one of the four triangles is the top. If all of the edges are equal in length, the triangles and the hexagon becomes regular. The dihedral angle between each triangle and the hexagon is approximately 70.5°, that between each square and the hexagon is 54.7°, and that between square and triangle is 125.3°. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular is a Johnson solid, and the triangular cupola is among them, enumerated as the third Johnson solid formula_1.

Given that formula_2 is the edge length of a triangular cupola. Its surface area formula_3 can be calculated by adding the area of four equilateral triangles, three squares, and one hexagon:
formula_4
Its height formula_5 and volume formula_6 is:
formula_7
It has an axis of symmetry passing through the center of its both top and base, which is symmetrical by rotating around it at one- and two-thirds of a full-turn angle. It is also mirror-symmetric relative to any perpendicular plane passing through a bisector of the hexagonal base. Therefore, it has pyramidal symmetry, the cyclic group formula_8 of order 6.

== Related polyhedra ==
The triangular cupola can be found in the construction of many polyhedrons. An example is the cuboctahedron in which the triangular cupola may be considered as its hemisphere. A construction that involves the attachment of its base to another polyhedron is known as augmentation; attaching it to prisms or antiprisms is known as elongation or gyroelongation. Some of the other Johnson solids constructed in such a way are elongated triangular cupola formula_9, gyroelongated triangular cupola formula_10, triangular orthobicupola formula_11, elongated triangular orthobicupola formula_12, elongated triangular gyrobicupola formula_13, gyroelongated triangular bicupola formula_14, augmented truncated tetrahedron formula_15.

The triangular cupola may also be applied in constructing truncated tetrahedron, although it leaves some hollows and a regular tetrahedron as its interior. constructed such polyhedron in a similar way as the rhombic dodecahedron constructed by attaching six square pyramids outwards, each of which apices are in the cube&#x27;s center. That being said, such truncated tetrahedron is constructed by attaching four triangular cupolas rectangle-by-rectangle; those cupolas in which the alternating sides of both right isosceles triangle and rectangle have the edges in terms of ratio formula_16. The truncated octahedron can be constructed by attaching eight of those same triangular cupolas triangle-by-triangle.

<doc id="1128471" wikidata="Q3487477" url="?curid=1128471" title="Return to Tomorrow">
<text>&quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot; is the twentieth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by John T. Dugan (under the pen-name &quot;John Kingsbridge&quot;) and directed by Ralph Senensky, it was first broadcast February 9, 1968.

In the episode, telepathic aliens take control of Captain Kirk, Dr. Ann Mulhall (Diana Muldaur), and First Officer Spock&#x27;s bodies in order to construct android hosts.

This episode was the first appearance of Diana Muldaur in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. She appeared again as Dr. Miranda Jones in the third season episode, &quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot; and as Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

==Plot==
The starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; receives a distress call from a lifeless planet. Upon arrival, a telepathic being named Sargon (voiced by James Doohan) addresses Kirk and Spock as his &quot;children&quot;, and invites them to beam down to the planet. Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Lt. Cmdr. Ann Mulhall beam to a subterranean vault where the voice of Sargon greets them from a luminous sphere on a pedestal.

Sargon explains that he and two others are the last survivors of their race; their minds, stored in these spheres, have existed here since their planet was devastated by war. Sargon then transfers his mind into Kirk&#x27;s body and Kirk&#x27;s mind into the sphere. Sargon explains that he and his companions will need human bodies temporarily, in order to construct android hosts for themselves, and then returns to his orb. Kirk, returned to his own body, declares his confidence in Sargon.

Back onboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the four meet with Chief Engineer Scott to consider Sargon&#x27;s request, and Kirk convinces the others with a rousing speech about risk. The spheres of Sargon, his wife Thalassa, and his former enemy Henoch, are brought up from the planet. McCoy supervises as Sargon takes Kirk&#x27;s body again, and Thalassa and Henoch take Mulhall&#x27;s and Spock&#x27;s bodies, respectively. When Sargon and Thalassa become exhausted by the strain of the transference, Henoch instructs Nurse Chapel in preparing a serum that will strengthen the host bodies. Chapel notices that the serum in the hypospray designated for Kirk does not contain the correct formula. Henoch confesses that he intends to kill Kirk, and Sargon with him, in order to keep Spock&#x27;s body. Henoch then erases Chapel&#x27;s memory of the conversation.

Manufacture of the android hosts begins. Kirk&#x27;s body weakens more quickly than the others, requiring additional doses of the serum. Henoch tries to tempt Thalassa into keeping their hosts&#x27; bodies, because the android forms will be incapable of sensuality. She in turn tries to convince Sargon, but he collapses. McCoy declares that Kirk&#x27;s body has died and Sargon is gone. Back in sickbay, McCoy is able to revive Kirk&#x27;s bodily functions, but has no way to restore Kirk&#x27;s mind. Thalassa offers to restore Kirk in exchange for McCoy&#x27;s help in keeping Mulhall&#x27;s body. When McCoy refuses, she assaults him telepathically, but then has a change of heart and relents. The voice of Sargon commends her, and she realizes that Sargon is using the ship itself as a temporary body. She then informs McCoy that Sargon has a plan, and locks him out of the examination room, after which Chapel marches out of sickbay. McCoy re-enters the examination room and finds that Kirk and Mulhall have been returned to their bodies. However, the spheres have been destroyed, including the one that held Spock&#x27;s mind. Kirk says that this was &quot;necessary&quot;, and asks McCoy to prepare a lethal hypospray for Henoch.

Henoch, who has taken control of the bridge and is terrorizing the crew, reads McCoy&#x27;s mind and prevents the injection. Henoch then commands Chapel to use the lethal compound on McCoy. She moves as if to comply, but then injects Henoch instead. Henoch boasts that he can just transfer to another body, but finds he cannot due to interference from Sargon. Henoch pleads for mercy, but Spock&#x27;s body collapses, seemingly in death.

Sargon tells Kirk that he could not allow this. Spock&#x27;s and Chapel&#x27;s bodies glow, and Spock revives. Sargon reveals that the injection was not lethal; it was important for McCoy and Chapel to believe it was lethal so that Henoch would believe it also. Spock&#x27;s mind had been temporarily placed in Chapel&#x27;s body.

Sargon and Thalassa announce that they will not attempt to build host bodies, but will &quot;depart into oblivion&quot; instead. They make a final request, which is granted: to be allowed to use Kirk and Mulhall&#x27;s bodies one last time to share a kiss.

==Reception==
Michelle Erica Green of &quot;Trek Today&quot; writes that the story is &quot;an entertaining and engaging episode about power, loyalty and the struggle between physical and mental pleasures... and because there&#x27;s an alien in his body, Spock spends a lot of time smiling&quot;. Of the characterizations, she adds, &quot;Nimoy appears to be having a wonderful time playing a relaxed, calculating villain, and Shatner portrays Sargon in an amplified booming benevolent voice that makes a nifty contrast to his would-be-Kennedyesque speechifying, expounding on the values that sent humans to the stars&quot;.

Green observes, &quot;The skepticism of godlike beings runs very deep on this series&quot;, and The A.V. Club&#x27;s Zach Handlen says on the same theme, &quot;we&#x27;re dealing with another race of god-beings, but for once, they aren&#x27;t here to torment Kirk and the rest. This time they actually need help, and it&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re bored&quot;. Like Green, he enjoys the acting: &quot;Nimoy gets a chance to ham it up here, and it really pays off. He has a half-smirk on his face most of the time, and he makes a great contrast to the somewhat overplayed nobility of Sargon and Thalassa and their love&quot;. He gives the episode a B+.

Melissa N. Hayes-Gehrke of the University of Maryland found it &quot;a nearly classic TOS plot, with god-like aliens, beings made only of energy, promises of advanced technology, and the realization that god-like powers are absolutely corrupting&quot;. She argued, though, that a &quot;big and frustrating plot hole&quot; is Sargon&#x27;s dismissal of the idea that Starfleet might build them android bodies. &quot;After all, the Enterprise recently discovered a world populated by advanced androids (&#x27;I, Mudd&#x27;). In fact, those androids would make anyone a body that they could transfer their mind into. We don&#x27;t know for sure that those bodies have senses, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine a human wanting to transfer into one for the purposes of immortality if they were limited in that way. These android bodies seem perfectly suited to Sargon&#x27;s people, and it&#x27;s annoying that the lack of series continuity kept it from being mentioned&quot;.

Eugene Myers ranked this as a superior example of &quot;several bodyswap/alien possession episodes of the series&quot; in terms of acting: Shatner has a &quot;nuanced performance, walking jerkily as though unaccustomed to legs after eons without a body&quot;, while &quot;Nimoy, of course, clearly enjoyed the opportunity to stretch his acting—and facial—muscles, playing out of character ... to smirk, smile, and scheme his way through his scenes&quot;. He rated the episode &quot;Warp 6 (on a scale of 1-6)&quot;.

<doc id="1128479" wikidata="Q76068" url="?curid=1128479" title="Square cupola">
<text>In geometry, the square cupola (sometimes called lesser dome) is a cupola with an octagonal base. In the case of all edges being equal in length, it is a Johnson solid, a convex polyhedron with regular faces.
It can be used to construct many other polyhedrons, particularly other Johnson solids.

== Properties ==
The square cupola has 4 triangles, 5 squares, and 1 octagon as their faces; the octagon is the base, and one of the squares is the top. If the edges are equal in length, the triangles and octagon become regular, and the edge length of the octagon is equal to the edge length of both triangles and squares. The dihedral angle between both square and triangle is approximately formula_1, that between both triangle and octagon is formula_2, that between both square and octagon is precisely formula_3, and that between two adjacent squares is formula_4. A convex polyhedron in which all the faces are regular is a Johnson solid, and the square cupola is enumerated as formula_5, the fourth Johnson solid.
Given that the edge length of formula_6, the surface area of a square cupola formula_7 can be calculated by adding the area of all faces:
formula_8
Its height formula_9, circumradius formula_10, and volume formula_11 are:
formula_12
It has an axis of symmetry passing through the center of its both top and base, which is symmetrical by rotating around it at one-, two-, and three-quarters of a full-turn angle. It is also mirror-symmetric relative to any perpendicular plane passing through a bisector of the base. Therefore, it has pyramidal symmetry, the cyclic group formula_13 of order 8.

== Related polyhedra and honeycombs==

The square cupola can be found in many constructions of polyhedrons. An example is the rhombicuboctahedron, which can be seen as eight overlapping cupolae.
A construction that involves the attachment of its base to another polyhedron is known as augmentation; attaching it to prisms or antiprisms is known as elongation or gyroelongation. Some of the other Johnson solids are elongated square cupola formula_14, gyroelongated square cupola formula_15, square orthobicupola formula_16, square gyrobicupola formula_17, elongated square gyrobicupola formula_18, and gyroelongated square bicupola formula_19.
The crossed square cupola is one of the nonconvex Johnson solid isomorphs, being topologically identical to the convex square cupola. It can be obtained as a slice of the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron or quasirhombicuboctahedron, analogously to how the square cupola may be obtained as a slice of the rhombicuboctahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; in this case the base polygon is an octagram. It may be seen as a cupola with a retrograde square base, so that the squares and triangles connect across the bases in the opposite way to the square cupola, hence intersecting each other.

The square cupola is a component of several nonuniform space-filling lattices:
* with tetrahedra;
* with cubes and cuboctahedra; and
* with tetrahedra, square pyramids and various combinations of cubes, elongated square pyramids and elongated square bipyramids.

<text>In geometry, the elongated square cupola is a polyhedron constructed from an octagonal prism by attaching square cupola onto its base. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated square cupola is constructed from an octagonal prism by attaching a square cupola onto one of its bases, a process known as the elongation. This cupola covers the octagonal face so that the resulting polyhedron has four equilateral triangles, thirteen squares, and one regular octagon. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is the Johnson solid. The elongated square cupola is one of them, enumerated as the nineteenth Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
The surface area of an elongated square cupola formula_2 is the sum of all polygonal faces&#x27; area. Its volume formula_3 can be ascertained by dissecting it into both square cupola and regular octagon, and then adding their volume. Given the elongated triangular cupola with edge length formula_4, its surface area and volume are:

<doc id="1128507" wikidata="Q7130032" url="?curid=1128507" title="Panania">
<text>Panania (), a suburb of local government area City of Canterbury-Bankstown, is located 23 kilometres inner south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, and is a part of the South-western Sydney region. The postcode is 2213, which it shares with adjacent suburbs East Hills and Picnic Point.

Panania is bounded on the north by the M5 South Western Motorway and the suburb of Milperra. Picnic Point, to the south, features parklands along the Georges River. East Hills is the suburb to the west and Revesby is located to the east.

==History==

The name &quot;Panania&quot; was on the original list of stations proposed for the Tempe-East Hills railway line in 1929. Prior to this, Panania was part of what was generally known as the East Hills district. Panania is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;sun rising in the east and shining on the hills&quot;. An alternative theory is that the name may be a derivation of &quot;Pannonia&quot;, which was an ancient province of the Roman Empire southeast of the Danube River. During the construction of the railway line the name Nioka was used for the station which is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;the green hill&quot;. Other names suggested for suburb were Linden Park and Elmswood.

The arrival of the railway in 1931 stimulated the development of the East Hills district. Prior to this, the district was rural. There was a soldiers&#x27; settlement at Milperra which consisted mostly of poultry and horticultural enterprises. The only public transportation was a bus service to Bankstown railway station on the Bankstown line from various locations throughout the district, which posed a great inconvenience to people who needed to visit the Sydney CBD for work.

Development began apace after World War II. The Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women sponsored the mass production of housing at Panania beginning from 1946 with the construction of 34 houses.

St Christopher&#x27;s Catholic Church on Tower Street was originally the Panania Star cinema. Panania North Public School, a short two block walk on the northern side of the railway line, became a demonstration school in the late 1970s so that trainee teachers from the newly established Milperra College of Advanced Education could observe teachers at work.

==Commercial area==
Panania has a shopping area adjacent to Panania railway station. It runs along Weston Street, Anderson Avenue and Tower Street. Anderson Avenue features several local government facilities including a senior citizens centre and a public library. Panania Hotel is located on the northern side of Panania railway station.

The active Business Chamber is a significant strength of Panania.

==Transport==

Panania railway station is on the East Hills railway line. Parts of Panania are serviced by buses operated by U-Go Mobility, generally following the routes established by McVicar&#x27;s Bus Services.

The East Hills railway line, which originally terminated one stop away at East Hills divided the suburb into two distinct precincts. During the 1980s, the railway line was extended with a rail bridge over the Georges River to Campbelltown.

==Demographics==
Panania had a population of 13,507 people at the . 49.0% of the population was male; 51.0% was female. 65.6% were born in Australia. 1.3% of the population were indigenous Australians.

===Employment===
At the 2021 census, 95.4% of Panania&#x27;s population were employed.

===Religious affiliation===
At the , the most common religious affiliations were: Catholic (26.4%), No Religion (21.8%), Anglican (10.4%), Eastern Orthodox (8.5%) and Islam (8.1%).

==Churches==

Panania features notable buildings such as Holy Trinity Anglican Church and St Christopher&#x27;s Catholic Church. St Christopher&#x27;s is housed in the building formerly known as the Panania Star Cinema. The Panania Star Cinema was built in 1952 in the Art Deco style, and was the twin of the Padstow Star Cinema in nearby Padstow. The building retains a number of original features, including a decorative ceiling. After a grant from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney and many donations from parishioners, the building underwent renovations costing $165,000 which were completed early in 2006.

The Salvation Army also has a Corps in Panania. The old building was recently refurbished.

Panania Uniting Church, was established in the early 1950s and moved to its current location at 206 Marco Ave, Panania in 1967.

==Schools==
*East Hills Girls Technology High School 
*East Hills Boys High School (est. 1955)
*Panania Public School
*Panania North Public School
*Tower Street Public School
*St Christopher&#x27;s Catholic School

==Houses==
Panania is mostly a residential suburb, which was developed after World War II and originally contained many modest freestanding bungalows built from asbestos cement sheeting (commonly known as fibro). Today, many of these houses have been rebuilt as larger residences or two-storey duplex houses.

==Notable residents==

* Paul Abrahams, bass player for The Reels
* Actor Bryan Brown
* Col Joye, singer-songwriter 
* Paul Makin, journalist
* Ron Raper, rugby league player

<doc id="1128511" wikidata="Q1456750" url="?curid=1128511" title="Holy kiss">
<text>The holy kiss is an ancient traditional Christian greeting, also called the kiss of peace or kiss of charity, and sometimes the &quot;brother kiss&quot; (among men), or the &quot;sister kiss&quot; (among women). Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that peace be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain ritualized or formalized uses long established in Christian liturgy. 

In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, the injunction for believers to greet one another with a holy kiss is given in five places in the New Testament. The early Christian apologist Tertullian wrote that before leaving a house, Christians are to give the holy kiss and say &quot;peace to this house&quot;. &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; likewise declared &quot;Then let the men apart, and the women apart, salute each other with a kiss in the Lord.&quot;

Among Conservative Anabaptists, such as the Conservative Mennonite churches and the Dunkard Brethren Church, the holy kiss is counted as an ordinance of the Church. As such, denominations of Conservative Anabaptism observe the practice of the holy kiss. Other denominations (such as the Catholic Church and Lutheran Churches) use various forms of greeting to serve equivalent purposes; these include kisses, handshakes, gestures or hugs, any of which may be called a sign of peace.

==History==

It was the widespread custom in the ancient eastern Mediterranean for men to greet each other with a kiss. It was also the custom in ancient Judea and practiced also by Christians. However, the New Testament&#x27;s references to a holy kiss (, ) and kiss of love () transformed the character of the act beyond a greeting; furthermore, in the early Church, &quot;the verbal exchange of &#x27;peace&#x27; with a kiss appears to be a Christian innovation, there being no clear example in pre-Christian literature.&quot; The holy kiss was thus followed as a biblical teaching, rather than a cultural tradition. Such a kiss is mentioned five times in the concluding section of letters in the New Testament:

*Romans 16:16—&quot;Greet one another with a holy kiss&quot; (Greek: ).
*1 Corinthians 16:20—&quot;Greet one another with a holy kiss&quot; (Greek: ).
*2 Corinthians 13:12—&quot;Greet one another with a holy kiss&quot; (Greek: ).
*1 Thessalonians 5:26—&quot;Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss&quot; (Greek: ).
*1 Peter 5:14—&quot;Greet one another with a kiss of love&quot; (Greek: ).

The early Christian apologist Tertullian wrote that before leaving a house, Christians are to give the holy kiss and say &quot;peace to this house&quot;. Justin Martyr, Origen, and Cyprian attested to the practice of the holy kiss among Christians as well.

Though also practiced outside of church, since the aforementioned epistles were addressed to Christian communities, the practice of the holy kiss was especially relevant in communal worship. It has been noted that these mentions of the holy kiss come at the end of these epistles, indicating &quot;that the kiss was shared in conjunction with the benedictions at the conclusion of worship services&quot; though it soon &quot;became associated with the Eucharist&quot; and thus &quot;its location during the worship service moved forward in time to the celebration of Communion.&quot; The holy kiss was seen as an essential part of preparing to partake in the Eucharist:

For the early Christians, the holy kiss &quot;was associated with the peace and unity given by the Holy Spirit to the congregation.&quot;

The writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call &quot;a sign of peace&quot;, which was already part of the Eucharistic liturgy, occurring after the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in the Roman Rite and the rites directly derived from it. St. Augustine, for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons:

Augustine&#x27;s Sermon 227 is just one of several early Christian primary sources, both textual and iconographic (i.e., in works of art) providing clear evidence that the &quot;kiss of peace&quot; as practiced in the Christian liturgy was customarily exchanged for the first several centuries, not mouth to cheek, but mouth to mouth (note that men were separated from women during the liturgy) for, as the primary sources also show, this is how early Christians believed Christ and his followers exchanged their own kiss. For example, in his (), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, &quot;And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?&quot;

The kiss of peace was known in Greek from an early date as (, &#x27;peace&#x27;, which became in Latin and &quot;&quot; in English). The source of the peace greeting is probably from the common Hebrew greeting ; and the greeting &quot;Peace be with you&quot; is similarly a translation of the Hebrew . In the Gospels, both greetings were used by Jesus – e.g. Luke 24:36; John 20:21, John 20:26. The Latin term translated as &#x27;sign of peace&#x27; is simply (&#x27;peace&#x27;), not (&#x27;sign of peace&#x27;) nor (&#x27;kiss of peace&#x27;). So the invitation by the deacon, or in his absence by the priest, &quot;Let us offer each other the sign of peace&quot;, is in Latin: (&quot;Offer each other peace&quot; or &quot;Offer each other the peace&quot;).

From an early date, to guard against any abuse of this form of salutation, women and men were required to sit separately, and the kiss of peace was given only by women to women and by men to men, with closed mouths.

The holy kiss was distinguished as a ritual only to be partaken of by baptized Christians, with catechumens and non-Christians not being greeted this way. Apostolic Tradition specified with regard to catechumens: &quot;When they have prayed they shall not give the kiss of peace for their kiss is not yet holy&quot;.

==In the Church==
Among Conservative Anabaptists, such as the Conservative Mennonite churches and the Dunkard Brethren Church, the holy kiss is counted as an ordinance of the Church. As such, denominations of Conservative Anabaptism observe the practice of the holy kiss.

The practice of a sign of peace remains a part of the worship in traditional churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox churches, Oriental Orthodox churches, the Church of the East; the Lutheran Church, the Anglican Church, and among Spiritual Christians, where it is often called the &#x27;kiss of peace&#x27;, &#x27;sign of peace&#x27;, &#x27;holy kiss&#x27; or simply &#x27;peace&#x27; or &#x27;pax&#x27;. 

=== Anabaptism ===
The holy kiss is particularly important among many Anabaptist denominations, being counted as an ordinance of the Church. Anabaptist groups observing the holy kiss include the Apostolic Christian Church, the Amish, the Schwarzenau Brethren, and many Conservative Mennonite Churches including the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church&#x27;s Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the exchange of the peace occurs at the midpoint of the service, when the scripture readings have been completed and the Eucharistic prayers are yet to come. The priest announces, &quot;Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess—&quot; and the people conclude the sentence, &quot;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided.&quot; At that point the kiss of peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries &quot;The doors! The doors!&quot;; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed.

In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the kiss of peace is preparation for the Creed: &quot;Let us love one another that we may confess[...] the Trinity.&quot;

In the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, laymen kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions. Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests. Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing.

Another example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people &quot;Peace be with all&quot;, and their reply: &quot;And with your Spirit&quot;. More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples.

=== Catholicism ===
In the Catholic Church, the term now used is not &quot;the kiss of peace&quot;, but &quot;the sign of peace&quot; or &quot;the rite of peace&quot;. The &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot; states: &quot;There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual charity before communicating in the Sacrament.&quot; The priest says or sings: &quot;The peace of the Lord be with you always&quot;, to which the people respond: &quot;And with your spirit.&quot; Then, as stated in the Roman Missal, &quot;if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: &#x27;Let us offer each other the sign of peace.&#x27;&quot;

In the Roman Rite, it is placed after the Pater Noster and before the Fractio Panis. Even within the Catholic Church, there are liturgical rites (the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in Matthew 5:23–24 about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of Justin Martyr in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as Roman Africa, where Saint Augustine understood it as related to the petition, &quot;Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us&quot;, in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.

Within the Roman Rite, instructions for the sign of peace differ depending on the liturgy being performed. In the Tridentine Mass, the sign of peace is given at Solemn Masses alone and is exchanged only among the clergy (unless emperors, kings or princes were present, in which case they, too, received the greeting by means of a pax). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words (&quot;Peace be with you&quot;), first by the priest celebrant to the deacon, who in turn gives it to the subdeacon, who gives the sign to any other clergy present in choir dress. There also existed a custom in some places of the groom giving the Peace to the bride at the Nuptial Mass. However, unlike the present form of the Roman Rite, neither the bride nor the groom would pass the peace to anyone else.

In the Mass of Paul VI, the sign of peace is used at most Masses but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that &quot;the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister.&quot; The manner prescribed is as follows: &quot;It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner. The Priest may give the sign of peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary, so as not to disturb the celebration. He does likewise if for a just reason he wishes to extend the sign of peace to some few of the faithful.&quot;

The following are considered abuses by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments:
*introducing a &quot;song of peace&quot; to accompany the rite;
*the faithful moving from their places to exchange the sign of peace;
*the priest leaving the altar to give the sign of peace to some of the faithful;
*expressing other sentiments, e.g. expressing congratulations, best wishes or condolences among those present at a wedding, funeral or other ceremony.

The gesture by which the sign of peace is exchanged is to be determined by the local episcopal conference. In some countries, such as the United States, the conference has laid down no rules, and the everyday handshake is generally used, while in other countries, such as India and Thailand, a bow is prescribed. A 2014 letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recommended that conferences choose gestures more appropriate than &quot;familiar and profane gestures of greeting&quot;.

=== Lutheranism ===
The Lutheran Church teaches:

Within the celebration of the Holy Communion, the sign of peace takes the form of a kiss or handshake.

=== Moravianism ===
=== Anglicanism and Methodism ===
In the Anglican Church it is common practice at more formal services for the congregation to be invited to &quot;offer one another a sign of peace&quot;. However, this is usually a handshake although married couples may kiss one another instead. Methodists likewise exchange &quot;signs and words of God&#x27;s peace&quot;.

=== Reformed ===
The Reformed tradition (inclusive of the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Evangelical Anglican and Congregationalist Churches) has adopted the holy kiss either metaphorically (in that members extend a pure, warm welcome that is referred to as a &#x27;holy kiss&#x27;) or literally (in that members kiss one another).

<doc id="1128527" wikidata="Q1892163" url="?curid=1128527" title="Willard (2003 film)">
<text>Willard is a 2003 American psychological horror film written and directed by Glen Morgan and starring Crispin Glover, R. Lee Ermey and Laura Elena Harring. It is loosely based on the novel &quot;Ratman&#x27;s Notebooks&quot; by Stephen Gilbert, as well as on the novel&#x27;s first film adaptation, &quot;Willard&quot; (1971), and its sequel, &quot;Ben&quot; (1972). It was not billed as a remake by the producers, who chose instead to present it as a reworking of the themes from the original with a stronger focus on suspense.

== Plot ==
Social misfit Willard Stiles, who cares for his ill and fragile but verbally abusive mother Henrietta in a musty old mansion, is constantly humiliated and mercilessly taunted in front of his co-workers by his vicious and cruel boss, Frank Martin, who took over the Stiles family company after Willard&#x27;s father Alfred committed suicide in 1995; Frank promised Stiles that Willard would have a job as long as she lived. After discovering and failing to exterminate a growing rat colony in the basement, Willard befriends and quickly becomes obsessed with a white rat he names Socrates, considering him his only real friend.

At work, Martin locks Willard in the elevator, though Willard&#x27;s sympathetic co-worker Cathryn eventually releases him. That evening, he watches Socrates begin tearing up a newspaper, prompting him to train the now-expansive horde of rats, including Ben, a monstrously large rat (portrayed in the film by a Gambian pouched rat) who envies Willard&#x27;s favoritism towards Socrates. After training the rats sufficiently, Willard takes them to Martin&#x27;s home and orders them to chew up the tires on Martin&#x27;s new Mercedes-Benz. While Willard initially rejects bringing along Ben with the other rats due to his size, the rat sneaks along anyway and chews a hole in the garage door to join the other rats in destroying all four tires of the Mercedes. A dog follows Willard in his hurried run from the house and he puts the dog in the bag before deciding to take it out after hearing it yelp when packed in with the rats. The next day at work, an on-time Willard gleefully watches Martin arrive late and tired. While Willard explains to the rats that they must move out, Henrietta overhears him, assuming he plans to get rid of her. Startled by noises from the basement, Willard finds her dead the next morning, having fallen down the basement stairs that allows the rats to come out from the basement, including a rebellious Ben. At the wake, Willard learns that Henrietta refinanced the family home to pay off Alfred&#x27;s debts resulting in the house&#x27;s payments falling behind and that the bank will likely foreclose upon the property.

In Henrietta&#x27;s bedroom, Willard finds an envelope from the coroner&#x27;s office containing the effects found on Alfred&#x27;s body, including the still-bloody pocket knife he evidently committed suicide with. Distraught, Willard attempts suicide with the knife until Socrates stops him. Attempting to comfort Willard, Cathryn describes her own mother&#x27;s death and gives him a pet cat, whose own mother helped Cathryn to grieve. Willard reluctantly takes it, with Socrates safely stowed in his pocket. In a scene set to the title song from the 1972 movie &quot;Ben&quot;, the rats (who have by now taken over the entire house) pursue and fatally overpower the cat.

Desperately lonely, Willard starts bringing Socrates to work with him. Despite a contract written by Alfred stipulating that he remain employed by the family company, Willard finds a note at his desk from Martin declaring that he is being fired. While Willard desperately pleads with Martin to let him keep his job, Martin&#x27;s secretary, Barbara Leach, discovers Socrates in the supply room. Her screams alert Martin, who fatally bludgeons Socrates to death while Willard watches helplessly. Fed up with all the torment, Willard finally snaps and hatches a plan to avenge Socrates&#x27; death with Ben. Loading the numerous rats into a company van, he confronts Martin and orders them to swarm upon Martin and kill him.

At home, Willard kills the remaining colony before ratproofing his entire house. Exhausted after the night&#x27;s events, he is finally awakened by the doorbell. Terrified by the shadows of two policemen, he remains standing in the hallway until the evening, seemingly feverish. Cathryn appears, informing Willard that Martin&#x27;s body was found and that rumors had arisen that he was either murdered or eaten by animals. Coming face-to-face with Ben, Willard tries to leave the house before realizing that the leftover rats have chewed out his car tires. Accosted by the two policemen, Willard retreats into the house and frantically attempts to prevent the rats from entering. Trapping himself in the kitchen, Willard is confronted by Ben, whom he tries to kill with a rat trap.

Believing Willard is insane, and aghast at the rat infestation, the police leave to call Bellevue Hospital and the health department. When Cathryn tries to enter the house, they warn her against entering, asking whether she wants to be eaten alive. Horrified, she connects the rats to Martin&#x27;s death and realizes Willard&#x27;s complicity. Ben, even though severely injured, viciously attacks Willard as he tries to escape. The police officers and Cathryn look on as Willard, outlined in the upstairs window, kills Ben with his father&#x27;s pocket knife.

The final scene reveals Willard in a psychiatric hospital, seemingly semi-catatonic and refusing to talk. A white rat appears in his cell, crawling into Willard&#x27;s sleeve as Socrates used to. Believing that his friend has been reincarnated, Willard joyfully drops his semi-catatonic act and begins telling the rat his plans for an escape.

== Cast ==
* Crispin Glover as Willard Stiles, a lonely outcast who is constantly abused by his boss Frank Martin, whom he feels stole the manufacturing business built by his father, and his beloved mother. He befriends a colony of rats, especially a white rat named Socrates and a large rat named Ben, though the latter soon becomes an antagonist. When Socrates is killed by Martin, he uses his rats to get revenge.
* R. Lee Ermey as Frank Martin, the cruel and psychopathic CEO of Martin-Stiles Manufacturing. He constantly insults and humiliates Willard for arriving late to work, and seems set on firing Willard and seizing his house, but is eventually eaten alive by Willard&#x27;s rats.
* Laura Elena Harring as Cathryn, one of Willard&#x27;s co-workers, who sympathizes with him and comforts him after his mother&#x27;s death. She quits her job in solidarity for the ill-treated Willard, although she later discovers his involvement in Martin&#x27;s death.
* Jackie Burroughs as Henrietta Stiles, Willard&#x27;s ill yet verbally abusive mother. Frail and eccentric, she berates her son for being single and feels that his life has been wasted. She is nevertheless anxious over her son, presumably related to the suicide of his father several years before. 
* Kimberly Patton as Barbara Leach, Frank Martin&#x27;s cynical secretary who is often rude and passive-aggressive to both Willard and Cathryn.
* William S. Taylor as Joseph Garter, a trustee of the Stiles estate who informs Willard of his dire financial situation after his mother&#x27;s death.
* Ty Olsson as Officer Salmon, a policeman who tries to talk to Willard, presumably regarding Frank Martin&#x27;s death. He asserts unambiguously that Willard is &quot;nuts&quot;.
* Bruce Davison, who portrayed Willard in the original 1971 film, makes a non-acting cameo appearance as Willard&#x27;s late father, Alfred Benjamin Stiles, in a portrait above the house&#x27;s fireplace.

<text>Neopythagoreanism (or neo-Pythagoreanism) was a school of Hellenistic and Roman philosophy which revived Pythagorean doctrines. Neopythagoreanism was influenced by middle Platonism and in turn influenced Neoplatonism. It originated in the 1st century BC and flourished during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition describes Neopythagoreanism as &quot;a link in the chain between the old and the new&quot; within Hellenistic philosophy. Central to Neopythagorean thought was the concept of a soul and its inherent desire for a &quot;unio mystica&quot; with the divine.

The word &quot;Neopythagoreanism&quot; is a modern (19th century) term, coined as a parallel of &quot;Neoplatonism&quot;.

==History==
In the 1st century BC Cicero&#x27;s friend Nigidius Figulus made an attempt to revive Pythagorean doctrines, but the most important members of the school were Apollonius of Tyana and Moderatus of Gades in the 1st century AD. Other important Neopythagoreans include the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa (fl. 150 AD), who wrote about the mystical properties of numbers. In the 2nd century, Numenius of Apamea sought to fuse additional elements of Platonism into Neopythagoreanism, prefiguring the rise of Neoplatonism. (Iamblichus, in particular, was especially influenced by Neopythagoreanism.)

Neopythagoreanism was an attempt to re-introduce a mystical religious element into Hellenistic philosophy in place of what had come to be regarded as an arid formalism. The founders of the school sought to invest their doctrines with the halo of tradition by ascribing them to Pythagoras and Plato. They went back to the later period of Plato&#x27;s thought, the period when Plato endeavoured to combine his doctrine of Ideas with Pythagorean number theory, and identified the good with the monad (which would give rise to the Neoplatonic concept of &quot;the One&quot;), the source of the duality of the infinite and the measured with the resultant scale of realities from the one down to the objects of the material world.

They emphasized the fundamental distinction between the soul and the body. God must be worshipped spiritually by prayer and the will to be good, not in outward action. The soul must be freed from its material surrounding, the &quot;muddy vesture of decay,&quot; by an ascetic habit of life. Bodily pleasures and all sensuous impulses must be abandoned as detrimental to the spiritual purity of the soul. God is the principle of good, matter the groundwork of evil. In this system can be distinguished not only the asceticism of Pythagoras and the later mysticism of Plato, but also the influence of Orphism and of Oriental philosophy. The platonic forms are no longer self-subsistent entities but are the elements which constitute the content of spiritual activity. The non-material universe is regarded as the sphere of mind or spirit.

The Porta Maggiore Basilica, where Neopythagoreans held their meetings in the 1st century, is believed to have been constructed by the Statilia gens. It was discovered in 1915 near Porta Maggiore on Via Praenestina in Rome.

<text>Salvador V. Vassallo (24 March 1942 – 21 January 2007) was the president and CEO of Vassallo Industries, headquartered in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The company produces PVC injection moulded and extruded goods, and markets them worldwide.

==Early years==
Vassallo (birth name: Salvador V. Vassallo Ruiz ), grandparents migrated from Italy in the late 19th century and settled in the town of Yauco. Vassallo, nicknamed &quot;Chiry&quot;, and his brothers were born in Yauco and raised in the city of Ponce where their father, Salvador Vassallo Sr., opened a hardware store.

After school hours, Vassallo and his brothers, Efraín, Víctor, Félix, and Marcos, would work in the family business. Salvador Vassallo Sr. founded Vassallo Industries, Inc., a company which initially made only windows and cement blocks.

==Salvador joins family business==
After Vassallo graduated from college, he went to work in as a salesman for his father&#x27;s business. Traveling throughout Puerto Rico taking orders from established customers, he made new contacts with potential customers. These skills would serve him well when Vassallo and his brothers inherited the business. In the 1950s, Vassallo&#x27;s brother Efrain David, an engineer and the oldest of the Vassallo brothers, saw the potential in plastic.

==Vassallo Industries Inc.==
As a consequence of Efrain&#x27;s vision, in 1962 Vassallo Industries Inc. pioneered the manufacture and distribution of plastic pipe and fittings for sanitary and electrical applications. In 1972, Salvador Vassallo Sr. died and the company was inherited by his sons. Efrain David was President and Chief Executive Officer of Vassallo Industries Inc. from 1978-89. During those 11 years the firm had a net profit of over $25 million, as audited by Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, 1978-89.

In 1989, Efrain David sold his interest in Vassallo Industries and all his patents to his brothers, and joined son Efrain David Jr., in the development of the Puerto Rican marble industry. Vassallo Industries, Inc., named Salvador as its president, and the company grew to become a global leader in the manufacture of PVC. Today, it has strong brand recognition in the United States and Latin-America. In the 1980s Vassallo opened a distribution Center in Miami, Florida, to speed up order fulfillment and cut costs.

==Vassallo Molding Company and other ventures==
In 1989 Salvador bought out his brothers and became president and chairman, assuming the CEO post in 2002. In the 1990s Vassallo founded Vassallo Molding Company for the manufacture of plastic furniture and household goods. In 1997, Home Depot became a client in addition to Kmart and Wal-Mart. The company added a research and development division to its growing empire, with emphasis on quality control. The company now has over forty patents for different PVC products.

In January 2000, Efrain Vassallo (the only Puerto Rican named National Small Businessman of the Year [in 1996], to date) rejoined his brother in Vassallo Industries Inc as a consultant. In 2003, Vassallo Industries Inc. invested $15 million in the expansion of its facility in Ponce, in an effort to produce Polyvinyl Chloride pellets for distribution in the United States, Caribbean and Latin America.

In 2004, Vassallo Industries Inc. acquired Syroco Inc., a plastics manufacturer, adding manufacturing operations in California, New York, and Arkansas. Syroco is one of the most prominent manufacturers of plastic furniture and wall decor in the United States. By acquiring Syroco, Vassallo Industries Inc. added Target, Sam&#x27;s Club, Lowe&#x27;s and Walgreens to its clientele.

Among the many products manufactured by the company founded by Salvador Vassallo are the following: fittings, flexible conduit, flower pots, leaf rakes, step stones, water tanks, pipes, PVC cement, kayaks and water floats. The company produces plastic furniture under the brand Signature Series Line.

==Later years==
Vassallo&#x27;s son, Rafael Vassallo, was named the president of Vassallo Industries Inc. and executive vice president of Syroco Inc. Salvador Vassallo continued to be the CEO of the company and president of the Export Council of Puerto Rico. His nephew, Jesse, (Victor&#x27;s son), a swimmer, has continued the family tradition by establishing &quot;Vassallo Unlimited&quot;.

==Death==
On 21 January 2007, Salvador Vassallo died in the Hospital San Cristóbal in Ponce from a heart attack. He was buried in Las Mercedes Cemetery, and was survived by his wife Olga and two children, Rafael and Viviana.

The Mayor of Ponce, Francisco Zayas Seijo, declared three days of mourning and ordered the flags at Ponce&#x27;s City Hall to be flown at half mast.

<text>Mapleton is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lane County, Oregon, United States. It is located on Oregon Route 126 and the Siuslaw River, west of Eugene and east of Florence. It is also the western terminus of Oregon Route 36. As of the 2000 census, Mapleton had a total population of 918.

==History==

Mapleton was likely named by Julia Ann &quot;Grandma&quot; Bean for the abundance of Bigleaf Maple trees in the area. Grandma Bean&#x27;s husband was Obediah Roberts Bean, and their eldest child was judge Robert S. Bean. Pioneers of 1852, the Beans moved to the Mapleton area in 1886 and the town was named shortly thereafter. There was a post office called Seaton established north of the locality in 1885, and when it moved to the Mapleton area in 1889, Mrs. Bean became postmaster. The post office was renamed Mapleton to match the town in 1896.

==Climate==
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Mapleton has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="1128540" wikidata="Q41188" url="?curid=1128540" title="Adamites">
<text>The Adamites, also called Adamians, were adherents of an Early Christian group in North Africa in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries. They wore no clothing during their religious services. There were later reports of similar sects in Central Europe during the Late Middle Ages.

==Ancient Adamites==
The obscure sect, dating probably from the 2nd century, professed to have regained Adam and Eve&#x27;s primeval innocence. Various accounts are given of their origin. Some have thought them to have been an offshoot of the Carpocratians, who professed a sensual mysticism and a complete emancipation from the moral law. Theodoret (Haer. Fab., I, 6) held this view of them, and identified them with the licentious sects whose practices are described by Clement of Alexandria. Others, on the contrary, consider them to have been misguided ascetics, who strove to extirpate carnal desires by a return to simpler manners, and by the abolition of marriage.

St. Epiphanius and Augustine of Hippo mention the Adamites by name, and describe their practices. They called their church &quot;Paradise&quot;, claiming that its members were re-established in Adam and Eve&#x27;s state of original innocence. Accordingly, they practiced &quot;holy nudism&quot;, rejected the concept of marriage as foreign to Eden, saying it would never have existed but for sin, and lived in absolute lawlessness, holding that, whatever they did, their actions could be neither good nor bad. They were therefore accused of devil worship. The old Adamites have been considered to be early Protestants.

==Neo-Adamites==

Practices similar to those of the ancient Adamites appeared in Europe several times in later ages. During the Middle Ages the doctrines of this obscure sect, which did not itself exist long, were revived. In the 13th century in the Netherlands the Brethren of the Free Spirit were sometimes called Adamites. They often took off their clothes during their secret rituals, believing that perfection could be achieved by a return to the perfect love of Adam and Eve. In the 14th century it was widely reported that heretics were practicing nude rites and chroniclers often referred to them as Adamites. In the 15th century the Taborites in Bohemia produced an offshoot known as the Bohemian Adamites. Everywhere these sects met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches. The splintering of Protestantism during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 17th century saw Adamites recorded in the &quot;Catalogue of the Several Sects and Opinions in England.&quot;

===Taborites and Bohemian Adamites===

The Taborite movement started in 1419 as the more radical branch of Hussitism in opposition to the authority of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic Church. One sect, the Bohemian Adamites, dissociated themselves from the Taborites and took up the practice of going naked through towns and villages. They preached that &quot;God dwelt in the Saints of the Last Days&quot; and considered exclusive marriage to be a sin. The historian Norman Cohn observed: &quot;Whereas the Taborites were strictly monogamous, in this sect free love seems to have been the rule. The Adamites declared that the chaste were unworthy to enter the Messianic kingdom ... The sect was much given to ritual naked dances held around a fire. Indeed, these people seemed to have spent much of their time naked, ignoring the heat and cold and claiming to be in the state of innocence enjoyed by Adam and Eve.&quot; Cohn also commented that the Adamites were criticised by other Taborites for &quot;never thinking of earning their own living by the work of their hands&quot;.

The Bohemian Adamites took possession of an island in the river Nežárka, and lived communally, practicing social and religious nudity, free love and rejecting marriage and individual ownership of property. Jan Žižka, the Taborite leader, nearly exterminated the sect in 1421. In the following year, the sect was widely spread over Bohemia and Moravia, and especially hated by the Taborites (whom they resembled in hatred toward the hierarchy) because the Adamites rejected transubstantiation, the priesthood and the Eucharist. The strife between the Adamites and the Taborites is dramatized in &quot;Against All&quot;, the third part of Otakar Vávra&#x27;s Hussite film trilogy (1958).

<doc id="1128541" wikidata="Q721687" url="?curid=1128541" title="Ascendancy (video game)">
<text>Ascendancy is a 4X science fiction turn-based strategy computer game. It was originally released for MS-DOS in 1995 and was updated and re-released for iOS in 2011 by The Logic Factory. Ascendancy is a galactic struggle to become the dominant life form, hence the title. The game&#x27;s introductory cinematic states: &quot;Wildly different cultures competed for the same worlds. In the enormous upheaval that followed, one of these species would gain ascendancy.&quot;

The iOS version of Ascendancy was a Universal app, meaning it was designed for both the iPad and the iPhone / iPod touch platforms.

The original &quot;Ascendancy&quot; was released during a golden age of 4X space games in the mid-1990s. Several reviewers praised the game for having great graphics being entertaining, and being fun to play.

The original version of the game won the Software Publisher&#x27;s Association Codie award for Best Strategy Software of 1996, as voted on by games industry members.

The music of the game was composed by Nenad Vugrinec.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Ascendancy&quot; the player takes on the role of leader of an alien species, tasked with guiding their people into space to explore and colonize other worlds. The player does this by building structures and space ships, researching technology and growing stronger through war or diplomacy.

Players begin with a single colony planet which must be developed. They can select several types of buildings to construct on the planet&#x27;s surface and can eventually construct spaceships and leave the planet altogether. Ships travel to other solar systems along determined paths, called &quot;star lanes&quot;. Spaceships can peacefully colonize unoccupied planets or invade inhabited planets and usurp structures. They can also do battle with enemy planets or other ships.

Ascendancy&#x27;s primary display is a three-dimensional rotatable model of the star cluster, which details the star cluster&#x27;s solar systems, starlanes, and civilizations. The player can &quot;zoom in&quot; to view rotatable models of solar systems (including planets and ships); view a planet&#x27;s surface and use various screens to manage their fleet, planets and research. This play style is similar to the &quot;Master of Orion&quot; series.

=== Planets ===
On each planet the player must manage three areas of development: Research, Industry and Prosperity. Research points are shared among all colonies and allow the player to learn new technology, such as advanced building structures or spaceship components. Industry, meanwhile, is local to each colony and determines how quickly that planet can complete projects. Prosperity determines how quickly a planet&#x27;s population will grow, providing additional workers for future construction. Players begin with the ability to construct buildings for each of these areas and can discover more as the game progresses.

Planet topography is expressed as various colored squares. White squares are general purpose, where any structure can be built. Green squares increase the output of Prosperity-producing buildings, while red squares improve Industry and blue squares improve Research. There are also black squares, which are initially uninhabitable but can be used later in the game as the player researches technology. Planets have ten orbital squares that can be used to build shipyards, planetary defenses, space ships, and other space structures.

As the player explores other planets they may occasionally find ruins from an ancient civilization. These ruins can be harvested to gain undiscovered technologies, which can significantly alter the game.

===Diplomacy===
&quot;Ascendancy&quot; contains a Diplomacy screen where players can offer alliances to other species, declare war and exchange information on star lanes, planets or research. Players can request military assistance from their allies or attempt to end declarations of war with hostile factions. There is also an Intelligence display where the player can view information on the relative power of known species.

===Game parameters===
When starting a new game players select several parameters, including their species, a star density, a political atmosphere and the number of opponents.

There are 21 species to choose from in &quot;Ascendancy&quot;, each of which has a unique special ability. Some abilities can be used at regular intervals, such as the Capelon&#x27;s ability to make their colonies temporarily invulnerable. Other abilities, such as the Chronomyst traveling quickly through star lanes, are continually active. All opponent species (numbering from two to six) are controlled by a computer AI and are selected randomly.

The &quot;star density&quot; in each game determines how many solar systems exist in the star cluster - the higher the density the more planets that are available to colonize. Star density affects both the length of the game, as large star clusters will take longer to conquer, as well as affecting how quickly species will encounter each other and how much room they have to grow. Once a density is selected the particular type of each star system is generated randomly at the start of the game.

Selecting a political atmosphere of Peaceful, Neutral or Hostile determines the attitude of computer opponents when they have a colony in the same system as another species.

Even though the player has control over several things, the combination of random opponent species, random planet topography and random star types leads to a large variety of games.

==Plot==
Several of the species in &quot;Ascendancy&quot; describe motivations for reaching to the stars. Some species are peaceful diplomats; some are curious explorers; and others want to kill or conquer other forms of life. However, plot in &quot;Ascendancy&quot; is thin. Players are free to imagine a detailed storyline but most plot is restricted to a single introductory screen for each species and a synopsis given at the end of each game.

==Development==
The Logic Factory said that inspiration for &quot;Ascendancy&quot; came from &quot;[having] read the fantastic books or watched some of the great shows that have explored the possibility of human contact with intelligent alien life. We do believe that there is a high likelihood that among the many billions of stars and planets just in our own Milky Way, other life is out there. ...This [game] is our own way of being part of that inevitable adventure.&quot;

===Re-release for iOS===

In 2010 the Logic Factory updated their website and announced that a remake of Ascendancy would be released for the iPhone and iPad, intended as &quot;a fully upgraded remake tailored for modern wireless gaming.&quot; The Logic factory said the game would be similar to the original, but with &quot;a complete overhaul&quot; to the interface &quot;in order to operate on mobile, wireless, touch screen devices&quot;, as well as having several &quot;upgrades and modifications to the original AI.&quot;

An iOS version of Ascendancy was released on the Apple app store on Jan 05, 2011. It has since been removed.

==Reception==
Some reviewers sang high praises for &quot;Ascendancy&quot; upon release - the game won the Codie award for Best Strategy Software in 1996, while Next Generation Magazine called Ascendancy &quot;one of the best space-strategy sims&quot; and said &quot;the variety of species will give you hours of replay value.&quot; In his 1995 &quot;PC Gamer&quot; review William Trotter called Ascendancy &quot;simply the best game of its type yet published&quot; and gave it the PC Gamer Editor&#x27;s Choice award. Trotter was also one of the authors of the official Ascendancy strategy guide. Bruce Geryk said &quot;the graphics were excellent, and the method of ship design was quite engaging,&quot; while Andy Bucher of PC Gamer UK said &quot;it looks great ... everything looks slick, clean and well designed ... Ascendancy mixes just about the right level of complexity and challenge with an intuitive interface, great graphics and the odd spark of humour.&quot; Bucher even noted that Ascendancy had &quot;one of the best tutorials [he&#x27;d] ever seen&quot;, and said the game&#x27;s &quot;attention to detail and ease of use is much rarer than it should be.&quot;

Other critics decried &quot;Ascendancy&quot;, however, for its unchallenging Artificial Intelligence as well as the excessive micromanagement required to compensate, because the AI is not only unchallenging as an opponent, but utterly unproficient at managing the player&#x27;s planet and ships. In his look back at the history of space games, Geryk said &quot;Ascendancy had the misfortune of being released with just about the worst AI ever in a computer game, to the extent that playing against the computer was almost pointless&quot;. Even Bucher said &quot;the key problem lies in the artificial intelligence.&quot; A patch was released under the name &quot;Antagonizer&quot;, which was specifically designed to make the AI more challenging. It did this by making the enemies far more hostile towards the player but not toward each other, giving them the significant industrial advantage of allowing them to build their first 3 structures on their new planetary colonies in one day each, having the NPC species build the right structures on the right colored squares and having attacking ships stop right outside of range of orbital missile bases the player has in orbit, if they have weapons with sufficient range to attack the planet from a safe distance. The iOS version of Ascendancy released in 2011 included the AI from this patch, as well as other modifications.

<text>Noti (pronounced NO-tie) is an unincorporated community in Lane County, Oregon, United States, located in the foothills of the Central Oregon Coast Range between Eugene and Florence. Per the 2000 census, Noti had a total population of 699.

==History==

Noti&#x27;s post office was established in 1913, when the name was changed from &quot;Portola&quot;. The first postmaster was H.G. Suttle. Suttle wrote that the name &quot;Noti&quot; was what a Native American once exclaimed in frustration with a white man. The white man had not tied up a horse as the native wanted him to during a trip up the Siuslaw River valley, but rather continued on riding the horse to Eugene, leaving the Native American behind. The Indian was heard shouting “no tie!”

Sailor Pioneer cemetery has numerous graves from the first settlers from 1850 on.

In 2002, Noti Grade School, a landmark built in 1927 and known as &quot;The Little Blue School&quot;, was closed.

==Geography==
Noti and the nearby communities of Elmira and Veneta lie on the western edge of the southern Willamette Valley. Fern Ridge Reservoir lies between this cluster of rural areas and the nearest sizable city of Eugene; the community of Crow lies just to the south.

The Long Tom River passes through Noti after originating in the eastern side of the coast range. Once reaching Noti, the river turns east, where it eventually enters the Fern Ridge Reservoir. The river ultimately empties into the Willamette River in two locations.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Noti has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.
==Economy==

Lumber operations started in 1922 when the Forcia and Larsen Mill was built at Star Camp, west of Noti. That mill burned down in 1946. Two current lumber mills operate in Noti. Swanson Brothers is the older of the two mills. It began operations in 1937. Swanson-Superior Forest Products has operated a small-diameter log mill in Noti since 1973. It is now owned by Seneca Sawmill and known as Seneca Noti.

The Coos Bay Rail Link serves the Swanson-Superior Mill.

<text>The Logic Factory was an award-winning video game development company founded by Jason and Todd Templeman in 1993. The brothers were joined in early 1994 by Thomas Blom to begin developing the demo that would secure initial distribution deals. The company is responsible for &quot;Ascendancy (1995)&quot;, a turn-based science fiction strategy game for the PC, The Tone Rebellion (1997), and &quot;Ascendancy for mobile gaming&quot; on the iOS platform (2011). In June 2014, The Logic Factory ceased maintaining its website and after 19 years released the domain which as of January 2018 remains available for purchase.

== Projects ==
Over the year since the release of the iOS version of Ascendancy (January 2011—January 2012), Logic Factory released several free updates to the game via the Apple iTunes App Store. These updates included new features to the game, such as long-range ship movement ordering, a ship design library, and graphics enhancements including colony production statistics appearing in the form of icons in the main display of the game.

Logic Factory had announced they would be continuing to work on new updates to Ascendancy iOS and would do so until the development team believes to have reached an appropriate stopping point, at which time they may decide to see this version of Ascendancy ported to other platforms, such as Android, Mac, PC, and/or consoles. Logic Factory stated they were working on new updates for Ascendancy, other games that fit within the Ascendancy universe, and products based upon years of time spent in research and development. The company announced they were committed to making Ascendancy II, but they had not revealed details of its design and development.

<text>&quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot; (1947) is a Donald Duck story by Carl Barks, first published in Dell Comics &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #178. It was the first appearance of Scrooge McDuck, a character who became a comic-book icon throughout the world.

Scrooge did not yet have his familiar characteristics in his first comic story. In &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot;, Scrooge was a bearded, bespectacled, reasonably wealthy old man, visibly leaning on his cane. He was living in isolation in a &quot;huge mansion&quot;, which is said to be influenced by Xanadu from Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Scrooge has always been a somewhat bitter character, but his misanthropic thoughts in this first story are probably less characteristic of Scrooge than those of his rival Flintheart Glomgold: &quot;Here I sit in this big lonely dump, waiting for Christmas to pass! Bah! That silly season when everybody loves everybody else! A curse on it! Me—I&#x27;m different! Everybody hates me, and I hate everybody!&quot;

==Plot==
As usual, Donald does not have enough money to celebrate Christmas with his three nephews. But, they are unexpectedly invited by his Uncle Scrooge to his chalet on the Bear Mountain. The misanthropic rich duck wants to stifle his boredom this Christmas by testing his nephew&#x27;s courage, and plans to dress up as a bear. But a bear cub sneaks in the cabin as the ducks get a Christmas tree. Eventually, the mother comes looking for the cub, and scares the Ducks out of the cabin. The bears eat the food in the house and the mother bear falls asleep in front of the fireplace.

The Ducks make a plan to get the bears out of the cabin, with Donald having to tie the legs of the mother bear together while Huey, Dewey, and Louie catch the cub. Donald fails to tie the bear&#x27;s legs and faints onto the animal, giving an impression that he fell asleep on it.

Meanwhile, Scrooge comes in and finds the boys chasing the cub, thinking that they are fearless. Then he finds Donald asleep with the bear and thinks he is purposely sleeping with the animal, coming to believe that Donald does not know the meaning of fear. Scrooge retreats unnoticed and returns the next day to spend Christmas Dinner in his mansion with his nephews.

==Development==
In a 1962 interview, Barks said that he had no thoughts of making Scrooge a recurring character at the time. &quot;I just needed a rich uncle for the story I was going to do. I thought of this situation of Donald having to do with Christmas, and Donald getting involved with a bear up in the mountains. Somebody had to own this cabin he was going to, so I invented Uncle Scrooge as the owner of the cabin.&quot;

Barks expanded on this in a 1975 interview: &quot;I had to get a Christmas story going, and somehow a person just automatically goes back to the old Dickens Scrooge story, the old classic, &#x27;cause part of the things that go along with Christmas, like the ringing of bells and singing of carols and so on, is the repetition of the old Scrooge classic. So I got to thinking of an old rich uncle, and gradually the story just kept building... I can&#x27;t say where these things come from. I have a situation that has to be solved, and somehow all the parts just commence coming into my head from someplace and I just fit them together, and pretty soon I had fitted together a story of the ducks getting permission from their rich uncle to go up on Bear Mountain and use his cabin overnight. Well, that, of course, meant that the rich uncle had to have a reason for doing that, so I brought in this thought that he wanted to know whether Donald was a real brave duck, and that led to the bear, and the situation of testing Donald&#x27;s courage. That&#x27;s the way those stories build. I have a bunch of things that have to go into a story, and so I just keep feeling around for the best gags that fit in. It&#x27;s like sewing together pieces of a shirt.&quot;

==Legacy==
Following this first Scrooge story, Barks decided that he was an interesting character, and he wanted to develop him more. This led to the June 1948 story &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot;, and all the Scrooge stories to come.

This story later inspired &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; Part 12 by Don Rosa. In Rosa&#x27;s story, which takes place on the day right after Christmas Eve, but before the dinner at Scrooge&#x27;s mansion, Huey, Dewey and Louie are first officially introduced to their uncle Scrooge. Donald, however, makes references to a previous encounter between him and Scrooge. Rosa&#x27;s story shows Scrooge being well known to everybody in Duckburg and it could be said Donald and the nephews hoped (with little to no enthusiasm) their stingy uncle to remember them. One detail in Rosa&#x27;s story that does not fit in &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot; is Scrooge&#x27;s appearance. However, this choice was intentionally made as Rosa wanted to maintain Scrooge&#x27;s more well-known appearance.

<text>Pleasant Hill is an unincorporated community in Lane County, Oregon, United States.

== History ==
Pleasant Hill was the first white settlement in Lane County when Elijah Bristow settled in 1846. He was the first of a party of four immigrants to settle, most recently from California. Also in the party was Eugene Skinner, Captain Felix Scott, and William Dodson. Dodson and Scott took up adjacent claims, Dodson to the southeast and Scott to the west of Bristow&#x27;s claim. Scott later abandoned and claimed opposite the mouth of the Mohawk River, some north of his previous claim. Skinner made his claim at what is now Eugene.

Pleasant Hill has survived numerous house fires and light flooding in lower areas, but the most remembered flood was in 1996. The flooding resulted in no deaths but many homes were destroyed.

== Geography ==
Pleasant Hill is from Creswell, in the area between the Coast Fork Willamette River and the Middle Fork Willamette River.

== Education ==
Public schools in Pleasant Hill include the OSAA class 3A Pleasant Hill High School and an Elementary School. Due to decreased enrollment and budget issues, Trent Elementary School has been closed. At this time, grades K-5 attend the Elementary and grades 6-12 attend the High School. Emerald Christian Academy, a private Seventh-Day Adventist K-10 school, is also located in Pleasant Hill.

==Notable person==
Pleasant Hill was the home of author and counter-cultural figure Ken Kesey, who died in 2001.

<text>&lt;/math&gt;
 | vertex_config = formula_1
 | properties = convex,&lt;br&gt;singular vertex figure
 | net = Johnson solid 37 net.png

In geometry, the elongated square gyrobicupola is a polyhedron constructed by two square cupolas attaching onto the bases of octagonal prism, with one of them rotated. It was once mistakenly considered a rhombicuboctahedron by many mathematicians. It is not considered to be an Archimedean solid because it lacks a set of global symmetries that map every vertex to every other vertex, unlike the 13 Archimedean solids. It is also a canonical polyhedron. For this reason, it is also known as pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron, Miller solid, or Miller–Askinuze solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated square gyrobicupola can be constructed similarly to the rhombicuboctahedron, by attaching two regular square cupolas onto the bases of an octagonal prism, a process known as elongation. The difference between these two polyhedrons is that one of the two square cupolas is twisted by 45 degrees, a process known as &quot;gyration&quot;, making the triangular faces staggered vertically. The resulting polyhedron has 8 equilateral triangles and 18 squares. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is a Johnson solid, and the elongated square gyrobicupola is among them, enumerated as the 37th Johnson solid formula_2.
The elongated square gyrobicupola may have been discovered by Johannes Kepler in his enumeration of the Archimedean solids, but its first clear appearance in print appears to be the work of Duncan Sommerville in 1905. It was independently rediscovered by J. C. P. Miller in 1930 by mistake while attempting to construct a model of the rhombicuboctahedron. This solid was discovered again by V. G. Ashkinuse in 1957.

== Properties ==
An elongated square gyrobicupola with edge length formula_3 has a surface area:
formula_4
by adding the area of 8 equilateral triangles and 10 squares. Its volume can be calculated by slicing it into two square cupolas and one octagonal prism:
formula_5
The elongated square gyrobicupola possesses three-dimensional symmetry group formula_6 of order 16. It is locally vertex-regular – the arrangement of the four faces incident on any vertex is the same for all vertices; this is unique among the Johnson solids. However, the manner in which it is &quot;twisted&quot; gives it a distinct &quot;equator&quot; and two distinct &quot;poles&quot;, which in turn divides its vertices into 8 &quot;polar&quot; vertices (4 per pole) and 16 &quot;equatorial&quot; vertices. It is therefore not vertex-transitive, and consequently not usually considered to be the 14th Archimedean solid.

The dihedral angle of an elongated square gyrobicupola can be ascertained in a similar way as the rhombicuboctahedron, by adding the dihedral angle of a square cupola and an octagonal prism:
* the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron between two adjacent squares on both the top and bottom is that of a square cupola 135°. The dihedral angle of an octagonal prism between two adjacent squares is the internal angle of a regular octagon 135°. The dihedral angle between two adjacent squares on the edge where a square cupola is attached to an octagonal prism is the sum of the dihedral angle of a square cupola square-to-octagon and the dihedral angle of an octagonal prism square-to-octagon 45° + 90° = 135°. Therefore, the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron for every two adjacent squares is 135°.
* the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron square-to-triangle is that of a square cupola between those, 144.7°. The dihedral angle between square-to-triangle, on the edge where a square cupola is attached to an octagonal prism is the sum of the dihedral angle of a square cupola triangle-to-octagon and the dihedral angle of an octagonal prism square-to-octagon 54.7° + 90° = 144.7°. Therefore, the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron for every square-to-triangle is 144.7°.

==Related polyhedra and honeycombs==
The elongated square gyrobicupola can form a space-filling honeycomb with the regular tetrahedron, cube, and cuboctahedron. It can also form another honeycomb with the tetrahedron, square pyramid and various combinations of cubes, elongated square pyramids, and elongated square bipyramids.&lt;br&gt;
The pseudo great rhombicuboctahedron is a nonconvex analog of the pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron, constructed in a similar way from the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.

==In chemistry==
The polyvanadate ion V18O42]12− has a pseudo-rhombicuboctahedral structure, where each square face acts as the base of a VO5 pyramid.

<doc id="1128560" wikidata="Q4926919" url="?curid=1128560" title="Blists Hill Victorian Town">
<text>Blists Hill Victorian Town is an open-air museum built on a former industrial complex located in Madeley, Telford and Wrekin, Shropshire, England. The museum attempts to recreate the sights, sounds and smells of a Victorian Shropshire town in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of ten museums operated by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust.

Originally Blists Hill was an industrial region consisting of a brick and tile works, blast furnaces and coal, iron and fire clay mines. The museum was opened in 1973 and has been growing ever since. The museum&#x27;s buildings fall into one of three categories, buildings that were already part of the industrial site, buildings that represent a generic type and original buildings that have been relocated to the museum.

The museum has three districts, a town area with Victorian era shops such as a bank, bakery, bicycle shop and post office. An industrial district that provided various employment from a blast furnace and wrought iron works and a countryside district with buildings such as a squatter&#x27;s cottage and tin roof church. The museum has been used as a venue for various television programmes and films, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

==History of the site==

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Blists Hill was an industrial region consisting of a brick and tile works, blast furnaces and coal, iron and fire clay mines operated by the Madeley Wood Company. A short section of the Shropshire Canal ran across the site to the Hay Inclined Plane, which transported boats up and down the tall incline from Blists Hill to Coalport.

===Introduction===
Blists Hill Victorian Town, originally called Blists Hill Open Air Museum, was opened in 1973, and has been slowly growing ever since. The museum&#x27;s buildings fall into one of three categories: buildings that were already part of the industrial site (&quot;e.g.&quot; the brickworks); buildings that simply represent a generic type (&quot;e.g.&quot; the sweet shop), some adaptively reusing existing premises on site or being replicas of those still standing elsewhere; and original buildings that have been relocated to the museum (&quot;e.g.&quot; The New Inn public house, which originally stood between Green Lane and Hospital Street in Walsall).

Each building is staffed by one or more costumed demonstrators, who have been trained in the skills and history of the profession they re-enact. For example, in the printshop, visitors can watch posters and newssheets being printed. The demonstrators normally talk in the third person, referring to the Victorians as &quot;they&quot; or &quot;them&quot; (rather than in the first person &quot;I&quot; or &quot;we&quot; which some similar museums employ): the museum management believes that this allows greater scope for comparing modern techniques with those re-enacted at the museum. Staff may also be seen performing such diverse tasks as operating stationary steam engines, iron founding and mucking out pigs. 

The first building visitors see in the museum is the bank (modelled on the still-standing Lloyds Bank branch in Broseley), at which they can change modern coinage into token coinage that represents the predecimal farthings, halfpennies, pennies, threepenny bits and sixpences, at an exchange rate of 40 new pence to 1 old penny. They can then use the token coins as an alternative to modern currency for buying goods whilst visiting the museum (the gift shop at the museum entrance operates only in modern currency).

===Town area===
The High Street area of the Upper Town has been developed around a London and North Western Railway interchange siding with a plateway which is an original feature of the site. Shops erected on the site include a chemist (with fittings from Bournemouth), butcher (from Ironbridge), grocer (replica of a building from Oakengates), and printer (with equipment from Kington, Herefordshire). Small crafts include an iron foundry, a shoeing smith, bootmaker, locksmith, decorative plasterer (with equipment from Burton upon Trent), builder, and sawmill.

Premises in Quarry Bank include a tallow candle manufactory (from Madeley), a bakery (from Dawley), a physician&#x27;s surgery (in a Sutherland Estate cottage from Donnington), and a Board School (from Stirchley).

Recent new developments have included the addition of &#x27;Canal Street&#x27;, which was a new build closely modelled on extant and historic buildings in the Telford area. This area includes a new Fish and Chip Shop, Drapers shop and Post Office, as well as an enlarged Sweet Shop. A walkway is located at the end of Canal Street, which leads visitors to the ruins of the brick and tile works. Adjacent to the ruins, and on select days, an operational replica of a steam locomotive designed and built by Richard Trevithick in 1802 runs on a short segment of narrow gauge track. The original locomotive was the world&#x27;s first steam locomotive on rails and was commissioned by the Coalbrookdale Company, which was located nearby (however, no record exists of this locomotive ever being successfully run). In 2015, the Trevithick Shed was built to house the locomotive when not in use.

===Ironworks area===

The original Madeley Wood Company blast furnaces produced pig iron from 1832 to 1911. Their remains have been conserved and a blowing engine from the Lilleshall Company&#x27;s Priorslee Ironworks installed in one of the houses. Nearby are displayed a pair of beam engines from the same location, alongside a wrought iron works using equipment from Thomas Walmsley&#x27;s Atlas Forge in Bolton in an iron-framed building designed by Rennie for Woolwich Dockyard.

===Countryside area===
The more remote parts of the site demonstrate natural recolonisation of an industrial landscape. Amongst buildings re-erected in this area are a corrugated iron tin tabernacle, (St Chad&#x27;s Mission Church from Lodge Bank), a squatter cottage (from Dawley), and a toll house (designed by Telford for the Holyhead Road at Shelton).

===New developments===
In 2009 a £12 million programme of redevelopment was completed which included the previously discussed buildings on Canal Street, a new World Heritage Visitor Centre, a narrow gauge Mine Railway, and a Inclined Lift supplied by WGH Ltd. The mine railway is intended to represent a 1920s clay mine, although the rolling stock is modern and the mine is formed by a concrete bunker. The inclined lift is entirely modern, and enables visitors with restricted mobility to access the lower part of the site. The project did not fund the restoration of the Scheduled Ancient Monuments and associated archaeological features on the site.

===Hay inclined plane===

The Hay Inclined Plane is a canal inclined plane with a height of 207 feet that is located on a short stretch of the Shropshire Canal that linked the industrial area of Blists Hill with the River Severn. The inclined plane was in operation from 1792 to 1894 and can be visited as part of the Blists Hill Victorian Town and is also a waypoint on the South Telford Heritage Trail. In operation box-shaped tub boats 20 feet long were taken up and down the plane on twin railway tracks, an empty boat would be loaded into the river at the bottom and a full boat would be loaded into the canal at the top, a rope would connect the two so that gravity would drop the loaded boat down to the river counterbalanced by an empty boat being raised to the canal. At the bottom of the incline the rails went underwater allowing the boats to float free.

==Filming location==
Blists Hill has been used as a filming location on several occasions. In 1979, the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Blue Peter&quot; included an item shot at the museum. The director of the piece subsequently chose it to be the principal filming location for the 1985 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;. The 1995 film &quot;Feast of July&quot; was shot at Blists Hill. An episode of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; was filmed at the location in September 2009. In 2010, &quot;Victorian Pharmacy&quot;, which was a historical documentary looking at life in the 19th century, used Blists Hill to recreate the scene at an everyday pharmacy.

<doc id="1128561" wikidata="Q641786" url="?curid=1128561" title="Crossroads (2002 film)">
<text>Crossroads is a 2002 American teen road comedy-drama film directed by Tamra Davis, from a screenplay by Shonda Rhimes. The film stars Britney Spears, Anson Mount, Zoe Saldana, Taryn Manning, Kim Cattrall, and Dan Aykroyd. Set in Georgia, its plot centers on three teenage girls on a cross-country road trip, as they find themselves and their friendship in the process.

Development began in late 2000 when Spears created a concept that was later expanded by Rhimes. Principal filming began in March 2001, and encompassed over six months. &quot;Crossroads&quot; was produced by MTV Films and released on February 15, 2002, in North America by Paramount Pictures, and was a box office success, grossing $61.1 million worldwide on a $10‒12 million budget. The film was panned by critics, though Spears&#x27; performance was praised. Spears&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Britney&quot; (2001) was promoted as the soundtrack to the film, in addition to &quot;Crossroads (Music from the Major Motion Picture)&quot;.

As part of a promotional campaign for Spears&#x27; memoir
&quot;The Woman in Me&quot;, the movie was acquired by Sony Music Entertainment (via RCA Records label, current holders of the former Zomba Recording Corporation / Jive Records&#x27; catalogue) who re-released it to theaters on October 23 and 25, 2023, alongside a special edition of the soundtrack.

==Plot==
As children growing up in a small Georgia town, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi bury a &quot;wish box&quot; and vow to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation. However, as the trio grows up, their friendship fades: Lucy becomes the introverted valedictorian, Kit becomes the most popular girl in school, and Mimi becomes an outcast from the trailer park facing teenage pregnancy.

On the night of graduation, they reunite to dig up the &quot;wish box&quot;, remembering their old wishes: Kit wanted to get married, Lucy wanted to find her mother who abandoned her, and Mimi wanted to travel to California. Lucy and Kit try to convince Mimi, who is five months pregnant, not to go to Los Angeles to audition for a record company. Lucy’s secret dream was being a singer like Kit and her father wanted her go to medical school. However, they decide to go with her to Los Angeles the next morning. Kit is going to see her fiancé who is a student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Lucy is going to find her mother in Tucson, Arizona.

Unbeknownst to her overbearing father Pete, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi depart in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark convertible with Mimi&#x27;s friend Ben. During the trip, the car breaks down in Louisiana and, with little money, Mimi suggests that they sing karaoke at a New Orleans bar for tips. At the bar, Mimi develops stage fright and is unable to sing. Lucy takes her place and is a hit, and the girls earn enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.

While staying at a motel in Alabama, Kit tells Lucy and Mimi that she heard a rumor about Ben going to jail for killing a guy. Uneasy for most of the trip, the girls finally confront Ben about the rumor, who reveals that he actually went to jail for driving his stepsister across state lines without parental consent because his stepfather was abusing her. Lucy and Ben fall in love with each other, and the girls have their first honest conversation since they were children: Lucy reveals that her mother left her and her father when she was three years old, but believes that her mother wants to see her again. Kit, who was overweight as a child, reveals that her mother sent her to &quot;fat camp&quot; every summer until she reached her goal weight. Mimi mentions that her baby&#x27;s father is not her ex-boyfriend Kurt, but a man who raped her at a party, and that she is planning to put her baby up for adoption.

In Tucson, Lucy finds her mother Caroline, who has remarried with two young sons and is unhappy to see her. Caroline reveals that Lucy was an unintended pregnancy and that she wants nothing to do with her, leaving Lucy heartbroken. At the motel, Ben consoles Lucy and impresses her by writing music to a poem she has written during the trip. Lucy then rejoins Kit, Mimi, and Ben, and they reach Los Angeles.

One night, Kit takes Mimi with her to surprise her fiancé Dylan. Alone together in the motel, Lucy loses her virginity to Ben. Kit and Mimi arrive at Dylan&#x27;s apartment to find him cheating on Kit with another woman. She then realizes that it was Dylan who raped Mimi, and punches him in the face. While running away, Mimi falls down the stairs and loses her baby. In the hospital, Lucy and Kit console her as she comes to terms with her loss, having decided to keep her baby once they reached Los Angeles.

Lucy calls her father to come take her, Kit, and Mimi back home, and Kit and Mimi tell her that she should go to the audition in Mimi&#x27;s place. Lucy declines and prepares to leave with them and her father, but realizes that everything she has done has been to please her father instead of herself. Lucy tells her father to let her go, runs to Ben, and they kiss. She, Kit, and Mimi head to the audition with Ben and receive a standing ovation for their performance of her song, &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;. The girls re-bury the &quot;wish box&quot; at a Los Angeles beach, deciding not to make any wishes for the future, but to focus on the present and their friendship.

==Cast==
==Production==
In early 2001, Spears said that she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later developed by &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; creator Shonda Rhimes. Spears commented that she &quot;talked to [Rhimes] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. When you do a movie, I think you have to be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into.&quot; A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l&#x27;Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.

Filming for &quot;Crossroads&quot; initiated in March 2001 in New Orleans, Metairie, Baton Rouge, and Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, near Spears&#x27; hometown. Due to the fact that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film&#x27;s production, filming wrapped up after only six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles County, California. &quot;Crossroads&quot; had a total budget of $12 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled &quot;What Friends are For&quot;. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film&#x27;s content, saying that it &quot;is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all you have at the end of the day. When your boyfriend breaks up with you, who do you call? Your girlfriend. I just love that message.&quot;

Justin Long, who plays one of Lucy&#x27;s best friends from high school, thought that &quot;Crossroads&quot; is &quot;like a road trip buddy movie for girls.&quot; Long also said that he was impressed by Spears&#x27; work ethic, commenting that &quot;she could not have been more down to earth. She&#x27;s the sweetest girl. After 10 minutes, I forgot she was a big pop star.&quot; Anson Mount revealed that before he took the role of Ben, he was on the set of the film &quot;City by the Sea&quot; with actor Robert De Niro. De Niro saw Mount with the &quot;Crossroads&quot; script and encouraged Mount to take the role, running a few of Spears&#x27; lines with him.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Crossroads&quot; was released in the United States on February 15, 2002. On its opening day, &quot;Crossroads&quot; grossed an estimated $5.2 million in 2,380 theaters, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the day. On the first weekend of its release, &quot;Crossroads&quot; placed second, grossing an estimate of $14,527,187. By the second week, the film dropped a 52% on tickets sales, ranking at number five at the box office. &quot;Crossroads&quot; was a moderate financial success, grossing a total $37,191,304 in the United States. Worldwide, the film grossed a total of $61,141,030 until its close day, on May 9, 2002.

=== Critical response ===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 15% approval rating based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 4.10/10, with the consensus: &quot;A cliched and silly pop star vanity project, &quot;Crossroads&quot; is strictly for Britney fans only.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, gave the film a 27 out of 100 based on 31 reviews from critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

John Anderson of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented &quot;Spears acquits herself as well as anyone might, in a movie as contrived and lazy as this one&quot;. Chris Kaltenbach of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said, &quot;go see &quot;Crossroads&quot; if you want to hear Britney sing or see her wear next-to-nothing. But otherwise, avoid this train wreck at all costs&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a positive review, commenting &quot;Crossroads&quot; &quot;not only makes excellent use of the singer&#x27;s sweetly coltish acting abilities, but it also promotes a standardized set of sturdy values with none of Mariah Carey&#x27;s desperate &quot;Glitter,&quot; or any of Mandy Moore&#x27;s gummy pap in &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;&quot;. Jane Crowther of BBC rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, applauded Cattrall and Aykroyd&#x27;s interactions with the characters, and said that &quot;Spears manages to come across on film as natural, endearing, and extremely likable&quot;.

Robert K. Elder of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said &quot;Spears delivers a performance with the same sincerity she invests into a Pepsi commercial, only this film contains twice the sugary calories&quot;, while &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writer Elizabeth Weitzman noted, &quot;Here&#x27;s what &quot;Crossroads&quot; does not have: Cohesive direction from Tamra Davis, intelligent dialogue, a comprehensible plot&quot;. Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; commented that &quot;the film&#x27;s mealy-mouthed messages about feminine empowerment will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, since even 11-year-olds know Spears&#x27;s power resides largely in her taut torso&quot;. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; considered it &quot;less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporter Ann Hornaday said, &quot;not a music video, not yet a movie, but more like an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney&quot;.

Jane Dark of &quot;Village Voice&quot; compared &quot;Crossroads&quot; to Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Glitter&quot;, saying, &quot;you spend a lot of time wondering, &#x27;Better or worse than &quot;Glitter&quot;?&#x27; You think if the projectionist cranked the volume a little you could actually sort of get into this&quot;.

The film was criticized for not promoting safe sex, to which Spears responded: &quot;I think by the time my character, Lucy, decides to make love in the film the audience realizes she&#x27;s responsible enough and hopefully did do that. There was a scene where I took a box of condoms out but they took that scene out because the movie was too long.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the top 10 worst chick flicks.

In 2021, Pamela Hutchinson wrote a critical reassessment in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, noting that prior negative reviews had &quot;recoiled at the film&#x27;s savvy as a star vehicle – the way it builds up and reinforces Spears&#x27;s commercial persona, from her virginity to her work ethic.&quot; Hutchinson argued &quot;&quot;Crossroads&quot; was designed to represent what Britney Spears meant to her young fans, a hand to hold through the minefield of growing up. That&#x27;s why her endearing earnestness shines through every deliberately unironic scene.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Home media===
&quot;Crossroads&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on July 23, 2002. It is out of print and has yet to be released as a Blu-ray version, or a DVD re-release.

In October 2023, the film&#x27;s director, Tamra Davis, confirmed that Sony Music Entertainment had acquired the film&#x27;s distribution rights back from Paramount Pictures. Later, it was reported that Netflix had purchased worldwide streaming rights for the film and was made available to watch on February 15, 2024.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;Crossroads (Music from the Major Motion Picture)&quot; features two songs by Spears: a karaoke version of her cover version of &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and a remix of &quot;Overprotected&quot; by JS16. The release also includes tracks by Mystikal, Matthew Sweet, Jars of Clay and Bowling for Soup. A new, expanded version of the soundtrack was released in October 2023, which accompanied the film&#x27;s theatrical rerelease.
Spears&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Britney&quot; (2001) contains three tracks that were used in &quot;Crossroads&quot;: &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;. &quot;Britney&quot; was also promoted as the soundtrack to the movie.

<doc id="1128563" wikidata="Q1195178" url="?curid=1128563" title="English Dissenters">
<text>English Dissenters or English Separatists were Protestants who separated from the Church of England in the 17th and 18th centuries. English Dissenters opposed state interference in religious matters and founded their own churches, educational establishments and communities. They tended to see the established church as too Catholic, but did not agree on what should be done about it.

Some separatists emigrated to the New World, especially to the Thirteen Colonies and Canada. Brownists founded the Plymouth Colony. English dissenters played a pivotal role in the spiritual development of the United States and greatly diversified the religious landscape. They originally agitated for a wide-reaching Protestant Reformation of the established Church of England, and they flourished briefly during the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell.

King James I had said &quot;no bishop, no king&quot;, emphasising the role of the clergy in justifying royal legitimacy. Cromwell capitalised on that phrase, abolishing both upon founding the Commonwealth of England. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the episcopacy was reinstalled, and the rights of the Dissenters were limited: the Act of Uniformity 1662 required Anglican ordination for all clergy, and many instead withdrew from the state church. These ministers and their followers came to be known as Nonconformists, though originally this term referred to refusal to use certain vestments and ceremonies of the Church of England, rather than separation from it.

Certain denominations of Dissenter Christians gained prominence throughout the world, including the Anabaptists, Baptists, Methodists, Plymouth Brethren, Puritans (Congregationalists) and Quakers.

==Organised dissenting groups (17th century)==

In existence during the English Interregnum (1649–1660):

=== Anabaptists ===

&quot;Anabaptist&quot; (literally, &quot;baptised again&quot;) was a term given to those Reformation Christians who rejected the notion of infant baptism in favour of believer&#x27;s baptism. It is generally assumed that during the Interregnum, the Baptists and other dissenting groups absorbed the British Anabaptists. Despite this, evidence suggests that the early relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were quite strained. In 1624, the five existing Baptist churches of London issued an anathema against the Anabaptists. Even today there is still very little dialogue between Anabaptist organisations (such as the Mennonite World Conference) and the Baptist bodies.

=== Baptists ===

Baptist historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins:

* The modern scholarly consensus that the movement traces its origin to the 17th century via the English Separatists.
* The view that it was an outgrowth of the Anabaptist movement of believer&#x27;s baptism begun in 1525 on the European continent.
* The perpetuity view, which assumes that the Baptist &quot;faith and practice&quot; has existed since the time of Christ.
* The successionist view, or &quot;Baptist successionism&quot;, which argues that Baptist &quot;churches&quot; actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ.

===Barrowists===
Henry Barrowe maintained the right and duty of the church to carry out necessary reforms without awaiting the permission of the civil power; and advocated congregational independence. He regarded the whole established church order as polluted by the relics of Roman Catholicism and insisted on separation as essential to pure worship and discipline.

===Behmenists===

The Behmenists religious movement began on continental Europe and took its ideas from the writings of Jakob Böhme (&quot;Behmen&quot; being one of the adaptations of his name used in England), a German mystic and theosopher who claimed divine revelation. In the 1640s his works appeared in England, and English Behmenists developed. Eventually, some of these merged with the Quakers of the time.

Böhme&#x27;s writings primarily concerned the nature of sin, evil and redemption. Consistent with Lutheran theology, Böhme believed that humanity had fallen from a state of divine grace into a state of sin and suffering, that the forces of evil included fallen angels who had rebelled against God, and subsequently that God&#x27;s goal was to restore the world to a state of grace. However, in some ways, Behmenist belief deviated significantly from traditional Lutheran belief. For example, Böhme rejected the concepts of sola fide and sola gratia.

===Brownists===
By 1580, Robert Browne had become a leader in the movement for a congregational form of organisation for the Church of England and attempted to set up a separate Congregational Church in Norwich, Norfolk, England. He was arrested but released on the advice of William Cecil, his kinsman. Browne and his companions moved to Middelburg in the Netherlands in 1581. He returned to England in 1585 and to the Church of England, being employed as a schoolmaster and parish priest.

===Diggers===
The Diggers were an English group of Protestant agrarian communists, begun by Gerrard Winstanley as &quot;True Levellers&quot; in 1649, who became known as &quot;Diggers&quot; due to their activities. Their original name came from their belief in economic equality based upon a specific passage in the Book of Acts. The Diggers tried (by &quot;levelling&quot; real property) to reform the existing social order with an agrarian lifestyle based on their ideas for the creation of small egalitarian rural communities. They were one of several nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time.

===Enthusiasts===

Several Protestant sects of the 16th and 17th centuries were called Enthusiastic. During the years that immediately followed the Glorious Revolution, &quot;enthusiasm&quot; was a British pejorative term for advocacy of any political or religious cause in public. Such &quot;enthusiasm&quot; was seen as the cause of the English Civil War and its attendant atrocities, and thus it was a social sin to remind others of the war by engaging in enthusiasm. During the 18th century, popular Methodists such as John Wesley and George Whitefield were accused of blind enthusiasm (i.e., fanaticism), a charge against which they defended themselves by distinguishing fanaticism from &quot;religion of the heart&quot;.

===Familists===
The &quot;Familia Caritatis&quot; (&quot;Family of Love&quot;, or the &quot;Familists&quot;) were a religious sect that began in continental Europe in the 16th century. Members of this religious group were devout followers of Dutch mystic Hendrik Niclaes. The Familists believed that Niclaes was the only person who truly knew how to achieve a state of perfection, and his texts attracted followers in Germany, France, and England.

The Familists were secretive and wary of outsiders. For example, they wished death upon those outside of the Family of Love, and re-marriage after the death of a spouse could only take place between men and women of the same Familist congregation. Additionally, they would not discuss their ideas and opinions with outsiders and sought to remain undetected by ordinary members of society: they tended to be members of an established church so as not to attract suspicion and showed respect for authority.

The group was considered heretical in 16th-century England. Among their beliefs were that there existed a time before Adam and Eve; Heaven and Hell were both present on Earth; and that all things were ruled by nature and not directed by God. The Familists continued to exist until the middle of the 17th century, when they were absorbed into the Quaker movement.

===Fifth Monarchists===
The Fifth Monarchists or Fifth Monarchy Men were Nonconformists who were active from 1649 to 1661 during the Interregnum. They took their name from a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that four ancient monarchies (Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman) would precede Christ&#x27;s return. They also referred to the year 1666 and its relationship to the biblical Number of the Beast indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings. 

===Grindletonians===
In a sermon preached at St Paul&#x27;s Cross on 11 February 1627, and published under the title &quot;The White Wolfe&quot;&quot;&quot; in 1627, Stephen Denison, minister of St Katharine Cree in London, charged the &#x27;Gringltonian [&quot;sic&quot;] familists&#x27; with holding nine points of an antinomian tendency. These nine points are repeated from Denison by Ephraim Pagit in 1645 and Alexander Ross in 1655. In 1635 John Webster, curate at Kildwick in North Yorkshire, was charged before a church court with being a Grindletonian, and simultaneously in New England John Winthrop thought that Anne Hutchinson was one. The last known Grindletonian died in the 1680s.

===Levellers===
The Levellers was a political movement during the English Civil War that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law and religious tolerance. Levellers tended to hold a notion of &quot;natural rights&quot; that had been violated by the king&#x27;s side in the civil wars. At the Putney Debates in 1647, Colonel Thomas Rainsborough defended natural rights as coming from the law of God expressed in the Bible.

===Methodists===
Methodism arose as a movement started by Anglican priest John Wesley, who taught two works of grace— (1) the New Birth and (2) entire sanctification. In the first work of grace, individuals repent of their sin and embrace Jesus as their saviour, accomplishing the acts of justification, regeneration, and adoption. In the second work of grace, which Wesley taught could be bestowed instantaneously, the believer is made perfect in love, original sin is uprooted, and he/she is empowered to serve God with an undivided heart. Wesley taught that those who receive the New Birth do not willfully sin. Additionally, he taught that the second blessing—entire sanctification—was &quot;wrought instantaneously, though it may be approached by slow and gradual steps&quot;. Growth in grace occurs after the New Birth, as well as after Entire Sanctification. The early Methodists were known by careful lifestyle, including wearing of plain dress, fasting on Fridays, devout observance of the Lord&#x27;s Day, and abstinence from alcohol.

===Muggletonians===
The Muggletonians, named after Lodowicke Muggleton, were a small Protestant Christian movement which began in 1651 when two London tailors announced they were the last prophets foretold in the biblical Book of Revelation. The group grew out of the Ranters and in opposition to the Quakers. Muggletonian beliefs include a hostility to philosophical reason, a scriptural understanding of how the universe works, and a belief that God appeared directly on Earth as Christ Jesus. A consequential belief is that God takes no notice of everyday events on Earth and will not generally intervene until it is to bring the world to an end.

Muggletonians avoided all forms of worship or preaching and, in the past, met only for discussion and socialising amongst members. The movement was egalitarian, apolitical, and pacifist, and resolutely avoided evangelism. Members attained a degree of public notoriety by cursing those who reviled their faith.

===Puritans===
The Puritans were a significant grouping of English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some Marian exiles from the clergy shortly after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558, as an activist movement within the Church of England. The designation &quot;Puritan&quot; is often used incorrectly, based on the assumption that hedonism and puritanism are antonyms: historically, the word was used to characterise the Protestant group as extremists similar to the Cathari of France, and according to Thomas Fuller in his &quot;Church History,&quot; dated back to 1564. Archbishop Matthew Parker used &quot;puritan&quot; and &quot;precisian&quot; with the sense of . T. D. Bozeman therefore uses instead the term &quot;precisianist&quot; in regard to the historical groups of England and New England.

===Philadelphians===
The Philadelphians, or the Philadelphian Society, were a Protestant 17th-century religious group in England. They were organised around John Pordage, an Anglican priest from Bradfield, Berkshire, who had been ejected from his parish in 1655 because of differing views, but was then reinstated in 1660 during the English Restoration. Pordage was attracted to the ideas of Jakob Böhme.

===Quakers===
The Quakers began as a loosely knit group of preachers, many of whom had previously been Seekers. George Fox&#x27;s journal attributes the name &quot;Quaker&quot; to a judge in 1650 calling them Quakers &quot;because I bid them tremble before the Lord&quot;. George Fox, often regarded as the father of Quakerism, taught that apart from Christ himself, there was &quot;none upon the earth&quot; that could cure unbelief and sinfulness. The inward experience of Christ, confirmed by the Bible, was the foundation of the Religious Society of Friends. The following characterized the Quaker message:

Additionally, Fox taught the doctrine of perfection—&quot;spiritual intimacy with God and Christ, entailing an ability to resist sin and temptation&quot;. Quakers commonly do a practice of unprogrammed worship where the congregation waits in silence waiting for inspiration from the Holy Spirit before doing anything letting the meetings structure work out on its own, similar to seekers. 

===Plymouth Brethren===

The Plymouth Brethren originated in Dublin in 1827.

===Ranters===
The Ranters were a sect in the time of the Commonwealth who were regarded as heretical by the established Church of that period. Their central idea was pantheistic, that God is essentially in every creature; this led them to deny the authority of the church, of scripture, of the current ministry and of services, instead calling on men to hearken to Jesus within them. 

Many Ranters seem to have rejected a belief in immortality and in a personal God, and in many ways they resemble the Brethren of the Free Spirit in the 14th century. The Ranters revived the Brethren of the Free Spirit&#x27;s beliefs of amoralism and followed the Brethren&#x27;s ideals which &quot;stressed the desire to surpass the human condition and become godlike&quot;. Further drawing from the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Ranters embraced antinomianism and believed that Christians are freed by grace from the necessity of obeying Mosaic Law. Because they believed that God is present in all living creatures, the Ranters&#x27; adherence to antinomianism allowed them to reject the very notion of obedience, thus making them a great threat to the stability of the government.

===Sabbatarians===
Sabbatarians were known in England from the time of Elizabeth I. Access to the Bible in English allowed anyone who could read English to study scripture and question church doctrines. While First-day Sabbatarians supported practices that hallowed the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday), the Seventh-day Sabbatarians challenged the church&#x27;s day of rest being on Sunday rather than Saturday. Some Dutch Anabaptists embraced Sabbatarianism and may have helped to introduce these practices into England. In England, Seventh-day Sabbatarianism is generally associated with John Traske (1585–1636), Theophilus Brabourne, and Dorothy Traske (c. 1585–1645), who also played a major role in keeping the early Traskite congregations growing in numbers.

Sunday Sabbatarianism became the normative view within the Church of England in one form or another. The Puritans were known to harbour First-day Sabbatarian views, which became well established in their successive Congregationalist Church, in addition to becoming entrenched in the Continental Reformed and Presbyterian churches, all of which belong to the Reformed tradition of Christianity. Additionally, the Moravian, Methodist, and Quaker denominations teach Sunday Sabbatarian views.

===Seekers===

The Seekers were not a distinct religion or sect but instead formed a loose religious society. Like other Protestant dissenting groups, they believed the Roman Catholic Church to be corrupt, which subsequently applied to the Church of England as well through its common heritage.

Seekers considered all churches and denominations to be in error and believed that only a new church established by Christ upon his return could possess his grace and power to change them within. Their anticipation of this event was found in their practices. For example, Seekers held quiet meetings as opposed to more programmed religious services and as such had no clergy or hierarchy. During these gatherings they would wait in silence and speak only when they felt that God had inspired them to do so. Seekers denied the effectiveness of external forms of religion such as the sacraments, water baptism and the Scriptures as a means of salvation. Many of them later became Quakers, convinced by the preaching of George Fox and other early Friends.

===Socinians===

The followers of Socinianism were Unitarian or Nontrinitarian in theology and influenced by the Polish Brethren. The Socinians of 17th century England influenced the development of the English Presbyterians, the English Unitarians and the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.

==18th century==

=== Rational Dissenters ===
In the 18th century, one group of Dissenters became known as &quot;Rational Dissenters&quot;. In many respects they were closer to the Anglicanism of their day than other Dissenting sects; however, they believed that state religions impinged on the freedom of conscience. They were fiercely opposed to the hierarchical structure of the established church and the financial ties between it and the government. Like moderate Anglicans, they desired an educated ministry and an orderly church, but they based their opinions on the Bible and on reason rather than on appeals to tradition and authority. They rejected doctrines such as the original sin or Trinity, arguing that they were irrational. Rational Dissenters believed that Christianity and faith could be dissected and evaluated using the newly emerging discipline of science, and that a stronger belief in God would be the result.

=== Swedenborgians ===
A tradition that emerged at the end of the 18th century is the Swedenborgian church, which continues today in several branches around the world. It originated in London in 1780. Beginning as groups reading Emanuel Swedenborg, whose members were composed largely of Methodists, Baptists, and Anglicans, some of the Swedenborgian enthusiasts became disillusioned with the prospects for thorough Swedenborgian theological reform within their respective traditions. These left those churches to form the General Conference of the New Jerusalem, often called simply the New Church. Other Swedenborgian converts, such as Anglican John Clowes and Thomas Hartley, argued for remaining within existing traditions. 

Swedenborg did not call for a new organisation but for profound theological reform for the existing churches. At the end of his life, he endured a rare Swedish heresy inquiry by the Swedish Lutheran Consistory. He died before it was concluded, and the Consistory shelved the inquiry without reaching a decision. Swedenborg&#x27;s primary critiques of orthodox theology centred on the tri-personal constructions of the Trinity, the idea of salvation by faith alone, and the vicarious atonement. He revived an allegorical tradition of reading scripture, which he believed was composed in correspondences. He believed in a theory of symbolic values in the literal text, which could produce an inner sense wherein the individual could ascertain the new theology.

<doc id="1128564" wikidata="Q385738" url="?curid=1128564" title="ISO 690">
<text>ISO 690 is an ISO standard governing bibliographic references in different kinds of documents, including electronic documents. This international standard specifies the bibliographic elements that need to be included in references to published documents, and the order in which these elements should be stated.

==Characteristics==
ISO 690 governs bibliographic references to published material in both print and non-print documents. The current version of the standard was published in 2021 and covers all kinds of information resources, including monographs, serials, contributions, patents, cartographic materials, electronic information resources (including computer software and databases), music, recorded sound, prints, photographs, graphic and audiovisual works, and moving images.

ISO 690 ranks among a number of ISO standards that bear on academic publishing, such as , which establishes rules for abstracts; ISO 2145, which deals with numbering of divisions and subdivisions of written documents; and ISO 2014 and ISO 3166, which, respectively, establish the correct use of dates and country codes.

Punctuation and style are not part of the standard; largely, the standard governs content rather than presentation.

ISO 690 prescribes a referencing scheme with a fixed order of bibliographic elements in which the publication date appears after the &quot;production information&quot; of &quot;place&quot; and &quot;publisher&quot;, but it allows an exception for the Harvard system, in which the date appears after the creator name(s).

The standard allows for three citation methods:
* &quot;name and date&quot; (&quot;Harvard system&quot;), in which the creator&#x27;s name and the year of publication of the resource cited are given in the text;
* &quot;numeric&quot;, in which numerals in the text – either in parentheses, brackets or superscript – refer to resources in the order in which they are first cited; and 
* &quot;running notes&quot;, in which numerals in the text – either in parentheses, brackets or superscript – refer to notes, which are numbered in order of their occurrence in the text.

==Publication history==
The first edition of the ISO 690 standard was published in 1975.

The second edition, published in 1987, includes elements specific to patent citations, rendering obsolete the ISO 3388:1977 standard devoted to them.

In 1997, ISO published a second part, devoted to the citation of electronic documents. As a consequence, the ISO 690 standard consisted of two separate parts from 1997 to 2010: ISO 690:1987, dealing with documents in general, and ISO 690-2:1997, dealing with electronic documents in particular.

In 2010, these two documents were revised and merged into a single work, constituting the third edition of the standard.

The fourth edition was published in June 2021 as ISO 690:2021.

==Usage==
In academic publishing, compliance with ISO 690 is often less than rigorous. 

==Examples of citation (ISO 690:1987)==
ISO 690 is copyrighted and not free for distribution. The application of versions preceding the current edition is not considered a fault.

<text>The Hay Inclined Plane is a canal inclined plane in the Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire, with a height of . It was located at the end of the Shropshire Canal, part of a network of canals that linked the industrial region of east Shropshire with the River Severn. The inclined plane was in operation from 1793 to 1894. It can be visited as part of the Blists Hill Victorian Town and is also a waypoint on the South Telford Heritage Trail.

==History==
The proprietors of the Shropshire Canal held a competition in 1788 to find the best means of raising and lowering heavy weights between the canal and the river Severn. They selected a design by Henry Williams and James Loudon, which was also used at a number of other inclined planes in east Shropshire. Construction of the Hay inclined plane was completed in 1793. By 1820 it was in poor condition and substantial repairs were needed. Further repairs were also carried out in the 1840s.

In 1857 the Hay inclined plane was taken over by the London and North Western Railway. The following year the LNWR closed the Shropshire canal between the Wrockwardine Wood and Windmill inclined planes, leaving only a short section of canal to serve the industrial area of Blists Hill. In 1861 they opened the Coalport branch line from Wellington to Coalport which passed underneath the Hay inclined plane near Coalport.
The last recorded use of the Hay inclined plane was thought to be in 1894 and it was formally closed in 1907. It was restored in 1968 and again in 1975, including the reinstatement of rails, as part of the creation of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums.

==Operation==
The Shropshire Canal used box-shaped tub boats long with a load capacity of 5 tons. Twin railway tracks were laid down the incline. The tub boats ascended and descended the inclined plane on wheeled cradles which ran on the rails. At the bottom of the incline the rails went underwater allowing the cradle to become submerged and the tub boat to either float free or be floated into position. At the top of the incline the rails also started under water then climbed a short slope out of the water to the top of the incline.

In operation an empty boat would be loaded into the bottom cradle and a full boat would be loaded into the top cradle. A rope would be attached to the loaded top cradle and it would be drawn out of the water to the top of the incline using a small winding drum driven by a steam engine. The main incline rope would then be attached to the cradle and the loaded boat would descend the incline, counterbalanced by an empty boat ascending on the other rail line. The speed would be controlled by a brake on the main winding drum. On reaching the summit a rope from the small winding drum would be attached to the cradle to control its descent into the upper basin.

Although the loaded boats were travelling downhill, and so the plane was mostly worked by gravity, a small steam engine was also provided and drove the winding drums. This was of Adam Heslop&#x27;s design, a twin-cylindered rotative beam engine, to a design patented in 1790. The remains of the brick boiler house and winding mechanism may be seen at the top of the incline.

The system was worked by four men and took around four minutes to raise or lower a boat.

<text>Red Slate Mountain is a summit in the Sierra Nevada. It lies along the Sierra Crest that divides Fresno County from Mono County, California.

Red Slate Mountain can be reached by scrambling either from McGee Pass, or starting from Bighorn Lake.

The area to the north of Red Slate Mountain is among the most seismically active in California which is associated with the Long Valley Caldera.

Red Slate Mountain was named by the California Geological Survey, in 1873. However, it is not clear whether the survey meant to name this peak, or Red and White Mountain.

<text>Lee Soo-man (, born 18 June 1952) is a South Korean business executive and record producer who is best known for being the founder of SM Entertainment, a multinational South Korean entertainment company based in Seoul. He has also been referred to as the &quot;president of culture&quot;, as one of the pioneers of the Korean Wave. Lee debuted as a singer in 1971 while he was a student at Seoul National University. In 1989, he founded SM Entertainment, which has since become one of the largest entertainment companies in the country.

==Biography==

===1952–1980: early years and singing career===
Lee was born in Jeonju, South Korea on 18 June 1952, and attended Seoul National University on and off between 1971 and 1979. Lee debuted as a member of the band April and May (사월과 오월, alternatively 4월과 5월) in 1972 (he had joined the band in 1971), but he later departed from it for health reasons. He gained spotlight for his &quot;good boy&quot; image, supported by the fact that he was one of the few people who were not involved in the weed scandal among Korean celebrities in 1975, and his high academic credentials in Seoul National University. He became known for hit songs such as &quot;행복 (Happiness)&quot;, released in 1978, and &quot;한송이 꿈 (A Piece of Dream)&quot; released in 1976. In 1977, he was a member of the Korean indie band . In addition to his career as a musician and his studies in university, he worked as a radio DJ and TV host during this time.
Lee Soo-man was also known for his trio with singers Lee Moon-sae and called Masamtrio (馬三트리오), named as such because of their appearances that resemble that of a long face of a horse.
In 1980, he formed the band 이수만과 365일 (Lee Soo-man and The 365 Days). However, media censorship policies under the Chun Doo-hwan government discouraged him from a career in the Korean music industry.

===1980–1985: studies in the United States===
In the early 1980s, Lee decided to leave the entertainment world in order to pursue a career in computer engineering. He went abroad to work on a master&#x27;s degree at California State University, Northridge, where he witnessed the rise of &quot;superstars of the MTV generation&quot; such as Michael Jackson. Inspired by the heyday of MTV in the United States, Lee set his sights on laying the foundation for the modern Korean pop music industry. In 1985, he returned to Korea &quot;with a vision of what the Korean music industry could be.&quot;

===1985–2021: founding SM Entertainment===
Following his return to Korea, Lee ventured back into the entertainment world by working as a DJ and presenter. In 1989, after four years of saving money and gaining experience in the industry, he established an entertainment company called SM Studio (named after his initials) in the Apgujeong neighborhood of Seoul, and signed singer Hyun Jin-young. During the 1990s, SM Studio developed an in-house system that looked after all aspects of its artists&#x27; careers. Lee&#x27;s approach was targeted at teenage audiences, and took a holistic view of the qualities needed to become a successful entertainer. The company was renamed SM Entertainment in 1995. In 1997, he founded the music production company Like Planning.

In February 2010, Lee resigned from his position as a member of SM&#x27;s board of directors, but maintained a role in the company&#x27;s &quot;management and artist development&quot; divisions. He continued to exert influence over SM through his production company, Like Planning, taking 6% of their revenue as a consultancy fee for his involvement in the music production process. He remained the biggest shareholder, controlling the company&#x27;s management rights. He founded the music publishing company Culture Technology Group Asia in May 2015 and drone company LeePollux in February 2019.

In 2019, KB Asset Management, SM&#x27;s third-largest shareholder, sent an open letter to the company complaining that Like Planning was taking 46% of SM&#x27;s operating profit each year. They demanded a merger between Like Planning and SM, which the company rejected. On 23 January 2020, Lee Soo-man was listed by &quot;Billboard&quot; as one of the world&#x27;s influential music industry leaders. He worked on South Korean girl group Loona&#x27;s 2020 EP &quot;[#]&quot;, which was his first ever project away from his namesake SM Entertainment.

===2022–present: departure from SM Entertainment===
In October 2022, SM announced that they would terminate their production contract with Lee&#x27;s Like Planning by the end of the year. On 3 February 2023, SM said that they would restructure the company without the help of Lee, adopting a multi-production center system to replace his role as chief producer. Kakao Entertainment purchased a 9.05% stake in SM, making them the second-largest shareholder, and signed a business agreement with SM to fund their plans. Lee, objecting to this, filed an injunction against the issuance of new shares and convertible bonds, which was upheld by the court. He sold his stake in SM to Hybe Corporation, making them the biggest shareholder. Hybe announced their intention to acquire the company with Lee&#x27;s support. This sparked a battle for SM&#x27;s management rights, pitting Lee and Hybe against the SM executives and Kakao.
Lee Sung-soo, SM&#x27;s co-CEO and Lee&#x27;s nephew by marriage, uploaded a video to YouTube in which he levelled a series of accusations at Lee. In the video, he claimed that Lee had founded a company called CT Planning Limited in Hong Kong in 2019 to evade taxes, through which he was taking 6% of earnings from artists&#x27; overseas activities. The company had been established using SM&#x27;s assets but was owned solely by Lee, and was the foreign equivalent of Like Planning. He also said that Lee wanted to force artists to publicly declare his importance to the company and attempted to insert environmental references into songs to promote his business interests. The National Tax Service said they would investigate the claims of tax evasion. Lacking the funds of their competitor, Hybe eventually withdrew from the takeover battle, enabling Kakao to become the largest shareholder and obtain management rights. Lee released a statement saying he was &quot;moving toward the future&quot;.

Upon leaving SM, Lee established a company called Blooming Grace, which will focus &quot;on the fusion of culture and technology&quot;. He acquired part of the Chinese autonomous aerial vehicle company EHang.

==Personal life==
Lee&#x27;s wife, Kim Eun-jin, died from cancer on 30 September 2014.

Lee is the paternal uncle of Sunny, one of the members of the popular SM group Girls&#x27; Generation.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2014, Lee donated million to the Korean Red Cross to help the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. He directed the Asia performance of Global Citizen&#x27;s charity concert, Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream. On 8 March 2022, he donated million to the Hope Bridge Disaster Relief Association to help those affected by the massive wildfires that started in Uljin, Gyeongbuk. and also spread to Samcheok, Gangwon.

==Controversies==

===Embezzlement case and conviction===
In 2002, the Supreme Prosecutors&#x27; Office of the Republic of Korea found evidence of Lee earning tens of billions worth of illegal market profits in August 1999 by acquiring 1.1 billion worth of stocks when listing stocks of SM Entertainment at KOSDAQ by a paid-in capital increase. The Supreme Prosecutors&#x27; Office of the Republic of Korea also investigated Lee regarding circumstantial evidence of lobbying to producers in broadcasting stations and keeping a tremendous amount of cash in his personal office and vaults.

Lee tried to escape prosecution by staying overseas from June 2002, and was found in a golf course in Los Angeles on 2 August in the same year. While on the run, Lee&#x27;s passport was nullified and Lee was chased by Interpol. Lee eventually came back to Korea to be investigated on 22 May 2003. A pre-arrest warrant was issued on 7 October, and Lee was arrested on 8 October. On 14 October, Lee was approved of bail after paying 30 million won. On 19 October, Lee was prosecuted without detention.

In September 2004, the Supreme Court of Korea sentenced Lee to two years of imprisonment along with three years of probation. Lee was released in a special exemption in 2007 commemorating the fourth year of Roh Moo-hyun&#x27;s presidency.

===Slave contract===
In 2009, three members of the boy band TVXQ took their management agency SM Entertainment owned by Lee to court, claiming that the agency&#x27;s 13-year-contract (often nicknamed a slave contract) was too long, too restrictive, and gave them almost none of the profits from their success. The following year, in 2010, South Korea&#x27;s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) created a rule that limited entertainment contracts to seven years.

===Other controversies===
In 2015, Lee Soo-man was alleged to have violated foreign exchange rules, having failed to report real estate purchased in Los Angeles, as mandated by the Foreign Exchange Law. His company responded that it was a &quot;mistake&quot; made by their American subsidiary. In 2021, he was included in the names of figures in the Pandora Papers. He was mentioned 399 times across 280 documents, tying him to eight paper companies in Hong Kong, five of which used a nominee service to conceal the source of their funds. SM Entertainment denied the allegations and said the companies had been founded using his father&#x27;s assets. Lee and SM were investigated by the National Tax Service following suspicions that he had omitted financial information and leaked company money in corporate transactions. As a result, SM was ordered to pay the government 20.2 billion won.

<doc id="1128590" wikidata="Q3274794" url="?curid=1128590" title="Camp Zama">
<text>is a United States Army post located in the cities of Zama and Sagamihara, in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, about southwest of Tokyo.

Camp Zama is home to the U.S. Army Japan (USARJ), I Corps (Forward), U.S. Army Aviation Battalion Japan &quot;Ninjas&quot;, 311th Military Intelligence Battalion, Japan Engineer District (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), 78th Signal Battalion and the Bilateral Coordination Department and 4th Engineer Group of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.

==Camp==
Camp Zama is close to the Sagami River near the foothills of the Tanzawa Mountain Range, Kanagawa Prefecture. The installation falls in the Zama City limits while the two housing areas, Camp Zama and Sagamihara Family Housing Area (SFHA), are located in the adjacent Sagamihara City. Once considered rural, this area has transformed into an urban area. New housing developments and communities along with shopping centers have increased the population and made traffic extremely congested.

Traveling from Tokyo and outlying U.S. military installations to Camp Zama averages from 1.5 to 3 hours depending on the time of day. However traveling from other parts of Kanagawa was made easier with the opening of the nearby Sagamihara/Aikawa Interchange which connects with the Ken-Ō Expressway in May 2012.

The closest train station to Camp Zama is the Odakyū Line&#x27;s Sōbudai-mae Station.

==History==
Camp Zama is located on the former site of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, which was named &quot;Sōbudai&quot; () by Emperor Showa. Camp Zama is the earliest barrack in Japan. The camp faced many changes as a result of the defeat suffered by the Japanese in World War II. Route 51 is the road to Camp Zama that was specifically built in order for the Emperor to travel to review the graduating classes from Machida Station. The Emperor Showa visited Camp Zama in 1937. Camp Zama also houses an emergency shelter for the Emperor, and to this day, it has been maintained by the U.S. Army Garrison Japan. The Camp Zama theater workshop is one of the few remaining buildings from the pre-occupation era. It is a large hall that was used for ceremonies by the Imperial Japanese Army. Additionally, the former recreation center still stands, currently used by the Camp Zama Tours and Travel Office and Boy Scouts, along with others.

In November 1984, Mother Teresa of Calcutta visited Camp Zama and spoke to an audience of 1,200 people.

The camp has been attacked several times by terrorists. First when a bomb was exploded outside the camp in 2002 by the &quot;Revolutionary Army&quot;. There was a further attack in 2007, which was speculated to be an Al-Qaida attack but responsibility was claimed by so-called &quot;Revolutionary Army&quot; responsible for the 2002 attack. There was another attempted attack in May 2015. A suspect was formally arrested in December 2018.

In 2004 Charles Jenkins, a U.S. Army sergeant who had deserted to North Korea in 1965, turned himself into Camp Zama. He was sentenced to a 30-day jail sentence and given a dishonorable discharge. He later gained permanent residency in Japan to live with his Japanese wife and family. Jenkins died of heart failure at age 77 in December 2017 near Sado, in Northern Japan.

In 2005 a live anthrax sample was sent to the base in error. It was destroyed in 2009.

In March 2007, Michael Jackson visited the camp to greet 3,000 plus U.S. troops and their families. Jackson was flown in on a Black Hawk helicopter from Hardy Barracks in Tokyo and addressed the frenzied crowd at the base&#x27;s Yano Fitness Center gymnasium:

&quot;It is an honor and privilege to be here today.&quot; Michael told the spectators. &quot;Those of you in here today are some of the most special people in the world because you have chosen a life of service. When we all sleep at night, we rest comfortably knowing that we are protected. And it is because of you here today and others who so valiantly have given their lives to protect us, that we enjoy our freedom. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you. Thank you so much.&quot;

Col. Robert M. Waltemeyer, Commander U.S. Army Garrison Japan, presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation for his devotion to U.S. Military troops and their families.

In December 2007 headquarters for the 1st Corps was opened at Camp Zama.

Personnel from the base assisted with Operation Tomodachi following and during the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and Fukushima I nuclear accidents. During the crisis, around 300 American family members voluntarily departed the base for locations outside Japan.

In 2013 a handgun went missing at the base, and was reported to police.

== Education ==
The United States Department of Defense operates several public schools in the base.
* Arnn Elementary School
* Zama Middle High School

Higher educational opportunities for those in the military and working for the Department of Defense, as well as for family members at Camp Zama are available through several contracted academic institutions. For example:
* University of Maryland University College
* Central Texas College

===Arnn Elementary School ===
The Sagamihara Elementary School opened in September 1951 with 300 students, ten teachers, and a principal. It started in a building purchased from the Japanese Government. This original building was destroyed by fire in 1975. Three temporary buildings were constructed in the summer of 1976 on the community play area across the street from the original school site. Later in 1978 three new buildings were completed on the original site and the campus was completed in 1983. These buildings served as the school until the new school replacement project was completed in May 2003. Fall 2003, the new John O. Arnn ES opened.

* School motto: &quot;Creating lifelong learners&quot;
* School mascot: The Knight
* School colors: Blue and green

===Zama American High School===

The Zama American High School, also known as ZAHS, first opened in 1959. It was opened to, and continues to serve, American dependents of U.S. Military and civilian employees stationed in the area, as well as U.S. Contractors. It was built at the bottom of &quot;General&#x27;s Hill&quot; on the north side of Camp Zama and remained there until 1968. In 1968, the school Principal, Mr. Richard A. Pemble, had the high school and Jr. High &#x27;switched&#x27;, and the high school then occupied two wooden army barracks close to the main gate. The barracks were the original Imperial Japanese Army buildings used to house Japanese Imperial army officer candidates during World War II, and subsequently house U.S. troops during the occupation.

In 1980, a new high school was built on the hill near the original site, and the historical barracks were subsequently torn down. The high school still serves the American School community for the U.S. dependents in the Camp Zama, Sagamihara, Atsugi Naval Air Facility and surrounding areas.

In 1987, the school split into Zama American Middle School and Zama American High School.

ZAHS has an active alumni association and biyearly reunions that draw members from all over the globe.

Zama American High School celebrated its 50th graduating class anniversary in June 2009.
In June 2012, the school was placed on accreditation probation by accreditation agency AdvancED. AdvancED&#x27;s report cited an &quot;obstructive and negative climate perpetuated by an intimidating, manipulative minority of staff members at the school&quot; as the main source of problems with the learning environment at the school. In fear of losing its accreditation, school staff had until April 2013 to correct the problem. In response, in April 2012, DoDEA called former Zama High School teacher Bruce Derr out of retirement to serve as principal and turn things around. In August 2012 DoDEA transferred union representative Brian Chance, identified as one of those reportedly contributing to the conflicts between faculty and administrators at the school, to Germany. One teacher was fired. Six other teachers were also transferred or elected to retire in lieu of accepting a transfer. The school met the deadline and is again fully accredited.

In 2012 the DoDEA boss agreed that Zama High School was failing and believed it should receive a D−. According to the 2012 Report of the Quality Assurance Review Team&#x27;s report SAT scores and other data is not easily accessible to the parents and the public.

In 2016, Zama American Middle School was found to have asbestos and is currently under construction prompting the middle school children be moved to the high school building temporarily.

In 2017, Zama High School combined with Zama Middle School, making Zama American Middle High School.
In 2013, Zama American High School students scored an average SAT Test Score of 1339 points, obtaining a 442 in critical reading, 465 in math, and 432 in writing,

<doc id="1128597" wikidata="Q76815" url="?curid=1128597" title="Emmy Hennings">
<text>Emmy Hennings (born Emma Maria Cordsen, 17 January 1885 – 10 August 1948) was a German poet and performing artist, founder of the Dadaist Cabaret Voltaire with her second husband Hugo Ball.

Known as the &quot;start of the show,&quot; countless creative works have been inspired by her life, including a best-selling novel, a graphic novel, short films, visual arts and countless other works. &quot;Suddenly my great-grandmother is on YouTube – although for a long time she was only considered an ecstatic groupie&quot;

==Life and work==
Hennings was born on 17 January 1885 in Flensburg, German Empire, describing herself later as &quot;a seaman&#x27;s child&quot;.

After the end of her first marriage in 1906, Hennings was an itinerant performer, traveling over much of the European continent. She was a performer at the Cabaret Simplizissimus in Munich, when she met Ball in 1913. At the time, Hennings was already a published poet, whose works had appeared in the left-wing publications &quot;Pan&quot; and &quot;Die Aktion&quot;. In 1913 she also published a short poetry collection called &quot;Ether Poems&quot;, or &quot;Äthergedichte&quot; in German. Later, Hennings was a collaborator to the magazine &quot;Revolution&quot;, which was founded by Ball and Hans Leybold.

Hennings and Ball moved to Zürich in 1915, where they took part in the founding of the Cabaret Voltaire, which marked the beginning of the Dada movement. 

Prior to the founding of the Cabaret Voltaire, the two struggled to make a living in Zürich during the early days of WW1. They toured, performing mostly in hotels around Switzerland. Hennings sang, did puppetry, and danced to music composed by Ball. She also recited her own poetry. In 1916 Ball and Hennings created Arabella, their own ensemble troupe, where Hennings performed under the name Dagny.

On 5 February 1916, Hennings and Hugo founded the Cabaret Voltaire at Spiegelgasse 1, 8001 Zürich. Hennings was a regular performer at the Cabaret Voltaire. Her performances included a role in &quot;Das Leben des Menschen&quot; (the Life of a Man), in which she appeared with Ball. This was the German premiere of the play by Leonid Andreev. Hennings also performed in a piece written by Ball, called &quot;Krippenspiel&quot;. 

Hennings married Ball on 21 February 1920. They had no children together. However, Hennings had a daughter, Annemarie, from a previous relationship, who took fondly to Ball. Hennings, who outlived Ball by two decades, lived in Magliaso, Switzerland from 1942 to 1948. She died on 10 August 1948 at a clinic in Sorengo, Switzerland.

==Dada star==
In &quot;The Magic Bishop: Hugo Ball, Dada Poet&quot;, author Erdmute Wenzel White writes that Hennings “was admired by expressionists as the incarnation of the cabaret artist of her time... The shining star of the Voltaire, according to the &quot;Züricher Post&quot; (Zürich Post), her role in Dada has not been adequately acknowledged.” (p. 11).

White also cites a poem by Johannes Becher which he uses as evidence that Emmy served as a muse for other artists of the time:&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was in Munich, at the Café Stefanie,&lt;br&gt;Where I recited for you, Emmy, poems&lt;br&gt;That I dared tell only you,&quot;

==Pop culture==
The novel, &quot;What was Beautiful and Good&quot; tells the story of Emmy Hennings as she navigates the early days of World War 1. Driven to find purpose amidst the chaos, the novel transports readers to a turbulent era where art becomes a beacon of hope, defying the darkness of war and igniting a global artistic revolution named &quot;Dada&quot;.

<doc id="1128603" wikidata="Q5216955" url="?curid=1128603" title="Daniel Deniehy">
<text>Daniel Henry Deniehy (18 August 1828 – 22 October 1865) was an Australian journalist, orator and politician; and early advocate of democracy in colonial New South Wales.

==Early life==
Deniehy was born in Sydney, the son of Henry and Mary Deniehy, former convicts of Irish birth who had prospered in the colony after their term had expired. Deniehy was educated at the best schools Sydney then had to offer, including Sydney College, and completed his education in England at his father&#x27;s expense. He travelled in Europe and visited Ireland, where he met leaders of the Young Ireland party. He was influenced by both English Chartism and Irish nationalism. Returning to Sydney in 1844, he studied law and became a solicitor in 1851.

==Career==
Meanwhile, Deniehy became a leading figure in Sydney&#x27;s small but lively literary world and in radical politics; artist Adelaide Ironside was an associate. Deniehy was a follower of the radical leader John Dunmore Lang (despite Lang&#x27;s violent dislike of the Irish and of Roman Catholicism), and a member of Lang&#x27;s organisation, the Australian League. He practised law in Goulburn 1854–58, in Sydney 1858–62, in Melbourne 1862–64 and in Bathurst 1865. In all these places he was active in local politics and journalism.

Like Lang, Deniehy was an advocate of extended democracy in the emerging political systems of the Australian colonies. He joined the opposition to the 1853 New South Wales Constitution Bill, which would have created a powerful unelected upper house and limited the franchise for the lower house to those owning substantial property. He was active in the New South Wales Electoral Reform League, which advocated manhood suffrage for the lower house and reduced powers for the upper house.

Deniehy argued that the real issue was control of the vast grazing lands of inland New South Wales, which the squatter class of early settlers had seized for themselves. He accused the conservatives, led by the veteran Sydney politician William Wentworth and what Deniehy called &quot;some dozen of his friends,&quot; of wanting to &quot;confiscate for their own uses the finest portions of the public lands, to stereotype themselves into a standing government, so that they may retain, watch over, and protect the booty they wrest.&quot;

When Wentworth proposed creating a hereditary peerage in New South Wales, Deniehy savagely satirised it: &quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;we all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a &quot;bunyip aristocracy.&quot; (The bunyip is a mythical beast of Aboriginal legend.) His ridicule caused the idea to be dropped.

Deniehy was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1857, representing Argyle (the Goulburn region). In 1859 he stood for West Sydney, but was defeated. However he was successful in 1860 representing East Macquarie (the Bathurst region). As a radical democrat, he should have been an effective supporter of the liberal parliamentary leaders Charles Cowper and John Robertson, but he disliked both these leaders, and was temperamentally unable to work in a parliamentary team. He soon became an isolated loner, and began to drink heavily. With the introduction of manhood suffrage in New South Wales in 1858 his campaign for democracy was fulfilled, and he was out of sympathy with the more advanced radicals.

Members of Parliament were not paid at this time, and Deniehy always earned his living as a barrister and as a journalist. He founded and edited &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, a radical newspaper, in 1859. Deniehy had opposed the appointment of Lyttleton Bayley as Attorney General and produced a satire &quot;How I Became Attorney-General of New Barataria&quot; (Sydney, 1860) which was published in the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. In Melbourne in 1862 he edited &quot;The Victorian&quot; for its owner, the Irish-Australian politician Charles Gavan Duffy. In Sydney he became a notable literary critic, and lectured on modern literature at the newly founded Sydney University. He was a regular contributor to the Irish-Australian newspaper &quot;The Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; and other papers.

==Late life==
Only 150 cm (five feet) tall and in poor health throughout his life, Deniehy possessed enormous energy and was a gifted orator. The Australian historian Manning Clark writes of him: &quot;His heart was a battlefield between the cherub and the insect of sensual lust.&quot; (He married Adelaide Hoals in 1852 and had seven children in nine years). &quot;At times his face caught a fire and beauty that looked like phases of actual transfiguration. At other times his face was coarsened by days of drunken debauchery.&quot; He died of alcoholism in Bathurst, aged only 37. In 1895 his remains were exhumed and reburied in Sydney&#x27;s Waverley Cemetery, where a monument was erected over the grave. An inscription on it reads:

:The vehement voice of the South
:Is loud where the journalist lies
:But calm hath encompassed his mouth,
:And sweet is the peace in his eyes.

As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal rotunda (&quot;J&quot;6) by attaching a decagonal antiprism to its base. It can also be seen as a gyroelongated pentagonal birotunda (&quot;J&quot;48) with one pentagonal rotunda removed.

== Area and Volume ==
With edge length a, the surface area is

<text>The Oconee River is a river in the U.S. state of Georgia. Its origin is in Hall County and it terminates where it joins the Ocmulgee River to form the Altamaha River near Lumber City at the borders of Montgomery County, Wheeler County, and Jeff Davis County. South of Athens, two forks, known as the Middle Oconee River and North Oconee River, which flow for upstream, converge to form the Oconee River. Milledgeville, the former capital city of Georgia, lies on the Oconee River.

The Oconee River Greenway along the Oconee River in Milledgeville opened in 2008; the North Oconee River Greenway is in Athens, Georgia. J.W. McMillan&#x27;s brick factory was located along the river.

==Course==
The Oconee River passes through the Oconee National Forest into Lake Oconee, a man made lake, near the towns of Madison and Greensboro off Interstate 20. From Lake Oconee, the river travels to Lake Sinclair, another manmade lake near Milledgeville, the town founded on Georgia&#x27;s Fall Line and former state capital. South of Milledgeville, the river flows unobstructed until merging with the Ocmulgee River to form the Altamaha River. Along the river there are many sandbars and oxbow lakes while the forest bottomland swamp surrounding the Oconee extends for miles, creating a very remote setting. Swamps along the Oconee river include Cow Hell Swamp in Laurens County.

==Name origin==
The river&#x27;s name derives from the Oconee, a Muskogean people of central Georgia. The Oconee lived in present-day Baldwin County, Georgia at a settlement known as Oconee Old Town, later moving to the Chattahoochee River in the early 18th century. The name exists in several variations, including Ocone, Oconi, Ocony, and Ekwoni.

==River pollution==
One of the main sources of pollution comes from fecal coliform bacteria, several species of bacteria found in human and animal feces. Fecal coliform bacteria enter the river through a number of sources; storm-water runoff leaving farmlands, storm-water runoff carrying pet waste, leaking septic and sewer lines contaminating surface or groundwater, and sewer spills throughout the watershed. Fecal coliform bacteria can be deadly to humans if ingested or acquired through an open wound. Fish caught in the Oconee Basin may be eaten if cooked thoroughly.

The second biggest form of pollution in the river is fertilizer. Nitrogen in fertilizer in the form of nitrates or ammonia, measured in parts per million, is found in regularly collected samples. These forms of nitrogen stimulate abundant growth of algae in the water.

The third largest source of pollution is sedimentation, typically caused by construction and urbanization.

==Crossings==
Crossings of the Oconee River include:
*Oconee River Bridge, east of Downtown Milledgeville, site of American Civil War resistance of the Fourth Kentucky Regiment, plus a unit of convicts from the Milledgeville penitentiary and a battalion of Georgia Military Institute cadets vs. a Union army corps (part of Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea).
* The Herschel Lovett Bridge is a steel girder bridge over the Oconee River along the Dublin–East Dublin city line. It carries US 80/US 319/SR 26/SR 29/SR 31. The bridge was named for Herschel Lovett, a Dublin businessman and politician.

<text>In geometry, the square orthobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by joining two square cupolae () along their octagonal bases, matching like faces. A 45-degree rotation of one cupola before the joining yields a square gyrobicupola ().

The &quot;square orthobicupola&quot; is the second in an infinite set of orthobicupolae.

The square orthobicupola can be elongated by the insertion of an octagonal prism between its two cupolae to yield a rhombicuboctahedron, or collapsed by the removal of an irregular hexagonal prism to yield an elongated square dipyramid (), which itself is merely an elongated octahedron.

It can be constructed from the disphenocingulum () by replacing the band of up-and-down triangles by a band of rectangles, while fixing two opposite sphenos.

==Related polyhedra and honeycombs==
The square orthobicupola forms space-filling honeycombs with tetrahedra; with cubes and cuboctahedra; with tetrahedra and cubes; with square pyramids, tetrahedra and various combinations of cubes, elongated square pyramids and/or elongated square bipyramids.

<text>In geometry, the pentagonal orthobirotunda is a polyhedron constructed by attaching two pentagonal rotundae along their decagonal faces, matching like faces. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The pentagonal orthobirotunda is constructed by attaching two pentagonal rotundas to their base, covering decagon faces. The resulting polyhedron has 32 faces, 30 vertices, and 60 edges. This construction is similar to icosidodecahedron (or pentagonal gyrobirotunda), an Archimedean solid: the difference is one of its rotundas twisted around 36°, making the pentagonal faces connect to the triangular one, a process known as gyration. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is the Johnson solid. The pentagonal orthobirotunda is one of them, enumerated as the 34th Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
The surface area of an icosidodecahedron formula_2 can be determined by calculating the area of all pentagonal faces. The volume of an icosidodecahedron formula_3 can be determined by slicing it off into two pentagonal rotunda, after which summing up their volumes. Therefore, its surface area and volume can be formulated as:

<doc id="1128626" wikidata="Q698084" url="?curid=1128626" title="Joseph Mohr">
<text>Josephus Franciscus Mohr, sometimes spelled Josef (11 December 1792 – 4 December 1848) was an Austrian Roman Catholic priest and writer, who wrote the words to the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Mohr was born in Salzburg on 11 December 1792, to an unmarried embroiderer, Anna Schoiberin, and Franz Mohr, a mercenary soldier and deserter, who abandoned Joseph&#x27;s mother before the birth. The ancestors on his father&#x27;s side came from the town of Mariapfarr in the mountainous Lungau region south of Salzburg, while his mother&#x27;s family was from the salt-mining city of Hallein. At his baptism shortly after birth, the godfather was recorded as Joseph Wohlmuth, the last official executioner of Salzburg, who did not personally attend but had himself represented by one Franziska Zachin. As the parents were unmarried, Joseph received the name of his godfather, according to custom.

Johann Nepomuk Hiernle, vicar and leader of music at Salzburg Cathedral, enabled Mohr to have an education and encouraged him in music. As a boy, Mohr would serve simultaneously as a singer and violinist in the choirs of the University Church and at the Benedictine monastery church of St. Peter. From 1808 to 1810, Mohr studied at the Benedictine monastery of Kremsmünster in the province of Upper Austria. He then returned to Salzburg to attend the Lyceum school, and in 1811, he entered the seminary. Since he was of illegitimate birth, a special dispensation by the pope was required in those days for him to attend seminary. On 21 August 1815, Mohr graduated and was ordained as a priest.

==Father Mohr==
In the autumn of 1815, Mohr was asked to provide temporary help in the village of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden. Mohr then served as assistant priest in Mariapfarr (1815–1817). It was during this time, in 1816, that he penned the words to &quot;Silent Night&quot; in Mariapfarr. Poor health forced him to return to Salzburg in the summer of 1817. After a short recuperation he began serving as an assistant priest at the Nikolauskirche in Oberndorf, where he made the acquaintance of Franz Gruber, schoolteacher in neighbouring Arnsdorf.

===&quot;Stille Nacht&quot;===


On a cold Christmas Eve in 1818, Mohr walked the three kilometres from his home in Oberndorf bei Salzburg to visit his friend Franz Xaver Gruber in the neighbouring town of Arnsdorf bei Laufen. Mohr brought with him a poem he had written some two years earlier. He needed a carol for the Christmas Eve midnight Mass that was only a few hours away, and hoped his friend, a school teacher who also served as the church&#x27;s choir master and organist, could set his poem to music. Gruber composed the melody for Mohr&#x27;s &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; in just a few hours.

The song was sung at Midnight Mass in a simple arrangement for guitar and choir. Various legends have sprung up over the years concerning the genesis of &quot;Silent Night&quot;, but the simplest and likeliest explanation seems to have been that Mohr simply wanted an original song that he could play on his favourite instrument, the guitar. Within a few years, arrangements of the carol appeared in churches in the Salzburg Archdiocese and folk singers from the Ziller Valley were taking the composition on tours around Europe.

==Later life==
Mohr, a generous man who donated most of his salary to charity, was moved from place to place, and remained in Oberndorf only until 1819. After Oberndorf he was sent to Kuchl, followed by stays in Golling an der Salzach, Bad Vigaun, Adnet and Anthering. In 1827 he was made pastor of Hintersee, and in 1837 of the Alpine village of Wagrain. Here he created a fund to allow children from poor families to attend school and set up a system for the care of the elderly. Mohr died of respiratory disease on 4 December 1848, at the age of 55.

==Legacy==
Mohr&#x27;s final resting place is in the tiny Alpine ski resort of Wagrain, where he died in 1848.
The Joseph Mohr School stands as a fitting memorial, and close to the grave of the man who wrote the words heard around the world. The village school is named after him and his grave has been kept in a place of honour in the nearby churchyard cemetery. An outdoor exhibit detailing the life of Joseph Mohr is situated on the walkway between the church and the parish house where he once lived. In 2006, the town&#x27;s Waggerl Museum set up a permanent exhibit – &quot;Joseph Mohr – Vicar of Wagrain&quot;.

In Austria, &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; is considered a national treasure. Traditionally, the song may not be played publicly before Christmas Eve.

Until 2006, it was thought that Mohr and Gruber had collaborated on just one composition, but another was located in the Wagrain parish archive by the Salzburg Archdiocesan authorities. The &quot;Te Deum&quot; with text by Joseph Mohr and melody by Franz Xaver Gruber can be heard in an audio exhibit at the Waggerl Museum in Wagrain.

<text>Robert Thomas Velline (April 30, 1943 – October 24, 2016), known professionally as Bobby Vee, was an American singer who was a teen idol in the early 1960s and also appeared in films. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, he had thirty-eight Hot 100 chart hits, ten of which reached the Top 20. He had six gold singles in his career.

== Early life ==
Vee was born in Fargo, North Dakota, to Sydney Ronald Velline (a chef, pianist and fiddle player) and Saima Cecelia Tapanila, in a family of Norwegian and Finnish heritage.

== Career ==

=== The Day the Music Died ===
Vee&#x27;s career began in the midst of tragedy. On February 3, 1959, &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;, three of the four headline acts in the lineup of the traveling Winter Dance Party—Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper—were killed in the crash of a V-tailed 1947 Beechcraft Bonanza airplane, along with the 21-year-old pilot, Roger Peterson. (Dion DiMucci, the fourth headliner, had opted to not travel on the plane.) It crashed near Clear Lake, Iowa, en route to the next show on the tour itinerary, in Moorhead, Minnesota. Vee, then 15 years old, and a hastily assembled band of Fargo schoolboys (including his older brother Bill) calling themselves the Shadows, volunteered for and were given the job of filling in for Holly and his band at the Moorhead engagement. Their performance there was a success and started Vee&#x27;s career as a popular singer.

In 1963, Vee released a tribute album on Liberty Records called &quot;I Remember Buddy Holly&quot;. In the liner notes, he recalled Holly&#x27;s influence on him and the events surrounding Holly&#x27;s death, describing how he had looked forward to attending the concert, how the local radio station put out a call for local talent to fill after the disaster, and how Vee&#x27;s recently organized group, modeled on Holly&#x27;s style, had to make up a name (the Shadows) on the spot.

Vee became a star, and he performed regularly at Winter Dance Party memorial concerts in Clear Lake. His three sons, all musicians, performed with him there.

=== Music ===
His first single, &quot;Suzie Baby&quot;, was written by Vee with a nod to Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; and was recorded in 1959 for the Minneapolis-based Soma label. The record was a hit in Minnesota and drew enough national attention to be purchased by Liberty Records, which signed Vee later that year.[6]

Vee&#x27;s follow-up single, a cover of Adam Faith&#x27;s UK number-one &quot;What Do You Want?&quot;, charted in the lower reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart in early 1960. His fourth release, a revival of the Clovers&#x27; doo-wop ballad &quot;Devil or Angel&quot; (U.S. number six), brought him into the big time with U.S. buyers. His next single, &quot;Rubber Ball&quot; (1961, U.S. number six, Australia number one), made him an international star. He has cited as influences, producer Snuff Garrett and his personal manager, Arnold Mills. Vee&#x27;s recording of &quot;Take Good Care of My Baby&quot; went to number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s U.S. pop chart in the summer of 1961 and number three in the UK Singles Chart.

Known primarily as a performer of so-called &quot;Brill Building pop&quot; material, Vee went on to record a string of international hits in the 1960s, including &quot;More Than I Can Say&quot; (1961, UK number 4), &quot;Run to Him&quot; (1961, US number 2; UK number 6), &quot;The Night Has A Thousand Eyes&quot; (1963, US number 3; UK number 3) and &quot;Come Back When You Grow Up&quot; (1967, US number 3).
On the recording of &quot;Come Back When You Grow Up&quot;, Bobby Vee and The Strangers are credited. However, that was merely the record label giving a name to the studio musicians working that day. Bobby&#x27;s original band, The Shadows, backed him on the road; upon learning of the UK band The Shadows who backed Cliff Richard, the band changed its name to The Strangers. In 1961 Vee recorded a version of the song &quot;Lollipop&quot;, originally by Ronald &amp; Ruby, which also became a success. Vee had a total of ten hit singles in the UK, ending with &quot;Bobby Tomorrow&quot; (UK number 21) in 1963.

In 1963, American Bandstand signed Vee to headline Dick Clark&#x27;s Caravan of Stars national U.S. tour, scheduled to perform its 15th show on the night of November 22, 1963, at the Memorial Auditorium in Dallas, Texas. The Friday evening event was cancelled after U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated that afternoon while touring Dallas in an open car caravan.

Vee was also a pioneer in the music video genre, appearing in several musical films and in the Scopitone series of early film-and-music jukebox recordings.

=== Connection with Bob Dylan ===
Early in Vee&#x27;s career, a musician calling himself Elston Gunnn briefly toured with the band. This was Robert Allen Zimmerman, who later went on to fame as Bob Dylan. Dylan&#x27;s mentions Vee and provides complimentary details about their friendship, both professional and personal.

In a concert at Midway Stadium in St. Paul, Minnesota, on July 10, 2013, Dylan said he had been on the stage with many stars, but that none of them were as meaningful as Vee. He said Vee was in the audience and then played Vee&#x27;s hit &quot;Suzie Baby&quot; with emotion. Dylan said (in a video recording of the concert):

Dylan also recalled that Vee &quot;had a metallic, edgy tone to his voice and it was as musical as a silver bell.&quot; Vee remembered that the musician he knew as Gunnn (Bob Dylan) &quot;played pretty good in the key of C.&quot;

Bobby and his sons opened and operated Rockhouse Productions in an old bank building in St. Joseph, Minnesota, which continues in operation. The Vees helped organize and performed for a number of years in the annual July 3 St. Joseph &quot;Joetown Rocks&quot; festival drawing many thousands of fans and area residents.

=== Last years and death ===
Vee continued performing live until 2011 when diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In 2011, friends and family contributed to his final new recordings which were eventually released as &quot;The Adobe Sessions&quot; on February 3, 2014. On April 29, 2012, Vee announced publicly that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s and consequently would withdraw from the music business. He had been in memory care (long-term care to meet the needs of those with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, dementia or other types of memory problems) for 13 months in a long-term care facility in Rogers, Minnesota, just outside of Minneapolis, and eventually received hospice care in the weeks prior to his death. On October 24, 2016, Vee died from complications of the disease at the age of 73.

=== Personal life ===

Vee and Karen Bergen married December 28, 1963. In the early 1980s, Vee moved his family from Los Angeles to near St. Cloud, Minnesota, where he and Karen organized annual fundraising concerts to provide music and arts facilities for local children. They had four children, including sons Jeffrey, Thomas, and Robert, who performed with Vee in his later career, and daughter Jennifer. Karen died of kidney failure on August 3, 2015.

== Awards and honors ==
Vee received the North Dakota Roughrider Award in 1999.

He is mentioned in the film &quot;No Direction Home&quot; regarding his brief musical association with Bob Dylan and Dylan&#x27;s suggestion that he was &quot;Bobby Vee&quot; after Vee&#x27;s regional hit.

&quot;The Very Best of Bobby Vee&quot;, released by EMI/UK on May 12, 2008, charted in the UK top five. On January 17, 2011, EMI/UK released &quot;Rarities&quot;, a double-CD package with 61 tracks, many of which were previously unreleased. Others included were alternate takes and first-time stereo releases as well as tracks from the album &quot;Bobby Vee Live on Tour&quot;, without the &quot;canned&quot; audience.

On March 28, 2011, Vee became the 235th inductee into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

An active live performer into 2011, Vee was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, at which time he completed his scheduled tour obligations and recorded his final CD, released three years later. In 2014 Vee was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame.

<text>Yamunotri, also Jamnotri, is the source of the Yamuna River and the seat of the Goddess Yamuna in Hinduism. It is situated at an altitude of in the Garhwal Himalayas and located approximately North of Uttarkashi, the headquarters of the Uttarkashi district in the Garhwal Division of Uttarakhand, India. It is one of the four sites in India&#x27;s Chota Char Dham pilgrimage. The sacred shrine of Yamunotri, source of the river Yamuna, is the westernmost shrine in the Garhwal Himalayas, perched atop a flank of the Bandarpunch mountain. The chief attraction at Yamunotri is the temple devoted to the Goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal springs at Janki Chatti which is 7 km away.

The actual source, a frozen lake of ice and glacier (Champasar Glacier) located on the Kalind Mountain at a height of 4,421 m above sea level, about 1 km further up, is not frequented generally as it is not accessible; hence the shrine has been located on the foot of the hill. The approach is extremely difficult and pilgrims therefore offer puja at the temple itself.

==Mythology==

According to Hindu legend, Sage Asita had his hermitage here. All his life, he bathed daily both in the Ganges and the Yamuna. Unable to go to the Gangotri during his old age, a stream of the Ganges appeared opposite Yamunotri for him.

Sangya is the birthplace of the Yamuna in the Champasar Glacier (4,421 m) just below the Banderpoonch Mountain. The mountain adjacent to the river source is dedicated to her father, and is called Kalinda Parvata (Kalinda is an epithet of the sun god Surya).

==Geography==
Yamunotri is located at . It has an average elevation of .

==Yamuna River==

The actual source of Yamuna River lies in the Yamunotri Glacier, at a height of , near the Bandarpunch peaks in the Lower Himalayas and is dedicated to goddess Yamuna. It crosses the states of Uttarakhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and later Delhi before merging with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj.

==Yamunotri Temple==

Yamunotri Temple is situated in the western region of Garhwal Himalayas at an altitude of near the river source. The temple was built in 1839 by Sundarshan Shah who was the king of the cultural center of Tehri. There was a small shrine at the site prior to the construction of the temple. The Divya Shila and Surya Kund are located near the temple. The Yamunotri Temple, on the left bank of the Yamuna, was constructed by Maharaja Pratap Shah of Tehri Garhwal. The deity is made of black marble. The Yamuna, like the Ganges, has been elevated to the status of a divine mother for the Hindus and has been held responsible for nurturing and developing the Indian civilisation.

There are hot water springs located close to the temple. Surya Kund is the most important. Near the Surya Kund there is a rock called Divya Shila, which is worshipped prior to offering worship to Yamuna. Devotees prepare rice and potatoes, tied in muslin cloth, to offer at the shrine by dipping them in these hot water springs. The cooked rice is taken back home as &quot;prasada&quot;.

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal birotunda is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a pentagonal birotunda (either or the icosidodecahedron) by inserting a decagonal antiprism between its two halves.

The gyroelongated pentagonal birotunda is one of five Johnson solids which are chiral, meaning that they have a &quot;left-handed&quot; and a &quot;right-handed&quot; form. In the illustration to the right, each pentagonal face on the bottom half of the figure is connected by a path of two triangular faces to a pentagonal face above it and to the left. In the figure of opposite chirality (the mirror image of the illustrated figure), each bottom pentagon would be connected to a pentagonal face above it and to the right. The two chiral forms of are not considered different Johnson solids.

<text>Saudi Aramco&#x27;s College Preparatory Center (CPC) is where the College Preparatory Program (CPP) is held. It is a pre-requisite to enter the College Degree Program for Non Employees (CDPNE), a highly selective program established in 1985 by the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Saudi Aramco. The CPP is a 10-months program of study at the CPC (near Industrial Training Center in Dhahran) for boys and STC (Special Training Center) which is located inside the seniors&#x27; campus, for girls. After those ten months, students move on to universities abroad either to the US, UK, Canada, China, Korea, Japan, or Australia and New Zealand to finish their 4-year bachelor&#x27;s degree education under the CDPNE program.

==History==
The program was exclusive for Saudi male students until Saudi Aramco announced it will give scholarships to female students during Summer-2006. For the Academic Year 2006–2007 251 males and 56 females were accepted in the program. For the Academic Year 2009-2010, 182 males and 43 females were accepted in the program. 
In 2003–2004, the admission rate was 1.20%, 148 admitted from a pool of 12,300 qualified applicants. Each student is assigned to a Saudi Aramco department related to his concentration of study. 
In 2013-2014, the admission rate was 2.2%, 350 boys and 82 girls admitted from a pool of more than 20,000 students all over the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

==Program==

During the year, students are divided into four tracks according to their Math and English placement test:
# D: High level in both Math and English.
# C: Regular Math and C in English.
# B: Regular or High-level Math and B in English.
# A: Regular or High-level Math and A in English.

The year in CPP is divided into three trimesters in which students take different subjects according to their level and major. All students take ESL courses, research courses, computer &amp; internet skills courses, and library skills courses. All the students also take AP preparation courses which are of great importance to the administration and faculty. All students except business students take AP Calculus AB, or AP Calculus BC. Some students take AP Computer Science, AP Chemistry, AP Physics B, AP Physics C, AP Statistics, AP Macroeconomics, AP Microeconomics.
During the year, C level students are offered to take two SAT tests, and one test for students in level B or A. All students are offered to take up to 3 IELTS tests if they didn&#x27;t achieve the required record in the first time. In some cases, an early departure is allowed for selective students to study in Far East countries such as China, Korea, Japan, and Australia. Which started in 1998, however, this program stopped in 2015. The CPP is divided into three units. The units are subdivided into departments as follows:
*Chemistry &amp; Geology Department (Chairman: Mr. Raymond Garcia),
*Computer Science Department (Chairman: Anonymous),
*General Studies &amp; English Department (Chairman: Mr. Ron Mortensen),
*Physics Department (Chairman: Mr. Ihab K. Ashkar),
*Mathematics Department (Chairman: Mr. Dennis Luy),
*Business Studies Department. (Chairman: Ms. Ria Madlangsakay),
*Personal Fitness &amp; Sports (PE) Department. (Chairman: Mr. Musa Abdul-Aziz),

Most of the staff who work in the CPP are from English speaking countries, and they are qualified. The style of education instruction mimics most American universities (schools) in the United States. 

The requirements for applying CPC are as follows:
# Be a recent high school graduate 
# a grade of 90 or higher in Qiyas assessment test must be scored in order for a student to be admitted to the program. But put in your mind to get a +95 score.
# a school GPA of at least 90% (3.60 / 4 ) must be scored in English, Maths, Computer, Physics, Biology, and Chemistry. 
# All students must submit a Tahsili score regardless of how good it is. If you score lower than 90% in High school, you should have a grade of 80 or higher in the Tahsili test.
# Passing Math and English placement test

The graduation requirements from CPC are as follows:
# an IELTS score of 6.5 or higher with each section no lower than 5.5 for CH and CR students, an IELTS score of 6.0 or higher with each section no lower than 5.5 for BR students, or an IELTS score of 5.5 or higher with each section no lower than 5 for AR students.
# a CGPA (Cumulative grade point average) of 2.5/4 or higher.
# a GPA of 2.5/4 or higher in the third trimester.
# To get at least D in the Research Paper Writing English course (ENGL036)

The benefits for all students :
# During those 10 months the company offers the students a free dorm room. The boys&#x27; dorm is located in Al-Munirah Camp, while the girls&#x27; dorm is located inside the seniors&#x27; camp. 
# A monthly salary of 4000 SR.
# Free bus transportation from CPC, STC to the dorms. 
# Students can book free airline tickets to Jeddah or Riyadh and even Yanbu through Aramco&#x27;s airline.

The benefits for girls: 
# The girls&#x27; dorm has 3 floors and about 36 rooms, on each floor there&#x27;s a lounge room which has a microwave and a TV and computers. There is a washing room filled with clothes&#x27; washing machine, an advisor to help the girls, and to make sure that the place is secured. There&#x27;s a spacious garden with a study room and a playroom. 
# living inside the camp for girls, which is a secure place and there are a lot of facilities and activities to do such as The Dhahran Recreation library, Al-Najjar Café, Tandoori House restaurant, Boling, Cinema, Duckpond playground, Dhahran Dining Hall, and a supermarket. 
# Free buses transportation to and from Dhahran Mall, Al-Rashid Mall at 3 different times a day.
All students who pass their first year in CPP are transferred to the CDPNE ( college degree program for nonemployee) and granted a full scholarship to one of the top overseas universities, mostly in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, and Australia with all expenses covered. Each scholar is given the opportunity to continue graduate studies up to the PhD degree, while receiving a full-time salary after working at least 5 years in the company. 
Students are allocated degree paths upon acceptance. Most of these degrees relate to Engineering and Sciences, and it depends on the company need, it&#x27;s not necessary they offer all of these majors every year.

<doc id="1128647" wikidata="Q3306684" url="?curid=1128647" title="List of mountains in Taiwan">
<text>The island of Taiwan has the largest number and density of high mountains in the world. This article summarizes the list of mountains that is under the Republic of China&#x27;s territorial jurisdiction. 

There are 268 mountain peaks over above sea level on the island, with Yushan (Jade Mountain – in Chinese) being the tallest mountain in both Taiwan and East Asia. Mountaineering is one of the most popular activities for many Taiwanese. A list of 100 Peaks of Taiwan was created in 1971, which lists the selected one hundred mountain peaks over 3,000 m for mountaineering on the island. Climbing all of the one hundred mountain peaks listed is considered a great challenge for Taiwanese climbers.

==Mountain ranges==
There are five mountain ranges in the main island of Taiwan
==List of high mountains==

===Over 3,000 m===

Notes:
*The rank and locations is that of the highest peak of each mountain.
*In total, there are 165 mountains over 3,000 m above sea level, with a total of 275 peaks.
*Of these 165 mountains, 116 (70%) are located in the Central Mountain Range, 41 (25%) in the Xueshan Range and 8 (5%) in the Yushan Range.
*Both the Alishan Range and the Hai&#x27;an Range (With Data Mountain and Xingang Mountain as the highest mountains respectively) don&#x27;t feature peaks exceeding 3,000 m above sea level, therefore they are not listed.

===Over 2,900 m===

Note:
*The &quot; – &quot; means the mountain was already listed in the last list above.

<doc id="1128649" wikidata="Q1569226" url="?curid=1128649" title="Revue des deux Mondes">
<text>The Revue des deux Mondes (, &quot;Review of the Two Worlds&quot;) is a monthly French-language literary, cultural and current affairs magazine that has been published in Paris since 1829.

According to its website, &quot;it is today the place for debates and dialogues between nations, disciplines and cultures, about the major subjects of our societies&quot;. The main shareholder is Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière&#x27;s FIMALAC Group.

==History==
The &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; was founded by Prosper Mauroy and Pierre de Ségur-Dupeyron, first appearing on 1 August 1829. It began when an anodyne periodical, &quot;Journal des voyages,&quot; was purchased by the young printer Auguste-Jean Auffray, who convinced his college roommate François Buloz to edit it. Its original emphasis on travel and foreign affairs soon shifted; according to its website, it was created to &quot;establish a cultural, economic and political bridge between France and the United States&quot;, the Old World and the New. It was purchased in 1831 by François Buloz, who was its editor until 1877, when Charles Buloz took over direction. Another influential editor was Ferdinand Brunetière (after 1893).

Among the early regular contributors who established the review&#x27;s reputation as an elite liberal vehicle of &quot;haute culture&quot; were Albert, 4th duc de Broglie, François Guizot, Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry, Ludovic Vitet, , the literary critics Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Gustave Planche, and Jean-Jacques Ampère.

Heinrich Heine first published an essay in three parts in 1834, &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne depuis Luther&quot;, a history of emancipation in Germany beginning with the Reformation. Stendhal published his novella &quot;Mina de Vinghel&quot; in the magazine. George Sand also serialized her novel &quot;Mauprat&quot; in the magazine in 1837. Marguerite-Hélène Mahé serialised her novel &quot;Sortilèges créoles: Eudora ou l&#x27;île enchantée&quot; (fr), describing slavery in Réunion. A later contributor was Hippolyte Taine.

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated square bicupola is the Johnson solid constructed by attaching two square cupolae on each base of octagonal antiprism. It has the property of chirality. 

== Construction ==
The gyroelongated square bicupola is constructed by attaching two square cupolae on each base of octagonal antiprism, a process known as gyroelongation. This construction involves the removal of octagons, and replacing them with cupolae. As a result, this polyhedron has twenty triangular and ten square faces. The Johnson solid is the convex polyhedron with all of its faces are regular, and the gyroelongated square bicupola is one of them, enumerated as formula_1.

== Properties ==
Given that the edge length formula_2, the surface area is:
formula_3
the total area of twenty equilateral triangles and ten squares. Its volume is:
formula_4
the total volume of two square cupolae and an octagonal antiprism. Its dihedral angles can be calculated by adding the components of cupolae and antiprism. The dihedral angle of antiprism between two adjacent triangles is approximately formula_5. The dihedral angle of each cupola between two squares is formula_6, and that between triangle and square is formula_7. The dihedral angle of the cupolae and antiprism between two adjacent triangles and triangle-square is formula_8 and formula_9, respectively.

The gyroelongated square bicupola is one of five Johnson solids, which is chiral, meaning that they have a &quot;left-handed&quot; and a &quot;right-handed&quot; form. In the following illustration, each square face on the left half of the figure is connected by a path of two triangular faces to a square face below it and on the left. In the figure of opposite chirality (the mirror image of the illustrated figure), each square on the left would be connected to a square face above it and on the right. These two chiral forms are not considered different Johnson solids. It has the symmetry of dihedral group formula_10.

<text>Not One Less is a 1999 drama film by Chinese director Zhang Yimou, adapted from Shi Xiangsheng&#x27;s 1997 story &quot;A Sun in the Sky&quot; (). It was produced by Guangxi Film Studio and released by China Film Group Corporation in mainland China, and distributed by Sony Pictures Classics in North America and Columbia TriStar Film Distributors internationally.

Set in the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the 1990s, the film centers on a 13-year-old substitute teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When one of the boys takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.

The domestic release of &quot;Not One Less&quot; was accompanied by a Chinese government campaign aimed at promoting the film and cracking down on piracy. Internationally, the film was generally well-received, but it also attracted criticism for its ostensibly political message; foreign critics are divided on whether the film should be read as praising or criticizing the Chinese government. When the film was excluded from the 1999 Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s competition section, Zhang withdrew it and another film from the festival, and published a letter rebuking Cannes for politicization of and &quot;discrimination&quot; against Chinese cinema. The film went on to win the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Golden Lion and several other awards, and Zhang won the award for best director at the Golden Rooster Awards.

== Background ==
In the 1990s, primary education reform had become one of the top priorities in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. About 160 million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People&#x27;s Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000 seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.

== Production and cast ==
&quot;Not One Less&quot; was Zhang Yimou&#x27;s ninth film, but only the second not to star long-time collaborator Gong Li (the first was his 1997 &quot;Keep Cool&quot;). For this film, he cast only amateur actors whose real-life names and occupations resembled those of characters they played in the film—as &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;″s Steven Rea described the performances, the actors are just &quot;people playing variations of themselves in front of the camera&quot;. For instance, Tian Zhenda, who played the mayor, was the real-life mayor of a small village, and the primary actors Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike were selected from among thousands of students in rural schools. (The names and occupations of the film&#x27;s main actors are listed in the table below.) The movie was filmed on location at Chicheng County&#x27;s Shuiquan Primary School, and in the city of Zhangjiakou; both locations are in Hebei province.

The movie was filmed in a documentary-like, &quot;neorealist&quot; style involving hidden cameras and natural lighting. There are also, however, elements of heavy editing—for example, Shelly Kraicer noted that many scenes have frequent, rapid cuts, partially as a result of filming with inexperienced actors.

Zhang had to work closely with government censors during production of the film. He related how the censors &quot;kept reminding [me] not to show China as too backward and too poor&quot;, and said that on the title cards at the end of the movie he had to write that the number of rural children dropping out of school each year was one million, although he believed the number was actually three times that. &quot;Not One Less&quot; was Zhang&#x27;s first film to enjoy government support and resources.

=== Cast ===
== Plot ==
Thirteen-year-old Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village to substitute for the village&#x27;s only teacher (Gao Enman) while he takes a month&#x27;s leave to care for his ill mother. When Gao discovers that Wei does not have a high school education and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than one piece of chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more. Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 yuan bonus if all the students are still there when he returns.
When Wei begins teaching, she has little rapport with the students: they shout and run around instead of copying their work, and the class troublemaker, Zhang Huike, insists that &quot;she&#x27;s not a teacher, she&#x27;s Wei Chunzhi&#x27;s big sister!&quot; After putting the lesson on the board, Wei usually sits outside, guarding the door to make sure no students leave until they have finished their work. Early in the month, a sports recruiter comes to take one athletic girl, Ming Xinhong, to a special training school; unwilling to let any students leave, Wei hides Ming, and when the village mayor (Tian Zhenda) finds her, Wei chases after their car in a futile attempt to stop them; and yet they, the sports recruiter and mayor, first notice and comment on Wei&#x27;s running ability, endurance, and tenacity.

One day, after trying to make the troublemaker Zhang apologize for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of Zhangjiakou. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.

In the city, Wei finds the people that Zhang was supposed to be working with, only to discover that they had lost him at the train station days before. She forces another girl her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her look for Zhang at the train station, but they do not find him. Wei has no success finding Zhang through the public address system and &quot;missing person&quot; posters, so she goes to the local television station to broadcast a missing person notice. The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not let her in without valid identification, though, and says the only way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as &quot;a man with glasses&quot;. For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station&#x27;s only gate, stopping every man with glasses, but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street. The next day the station manager (Wu Wanlu) sees her at the gate again, through his window, and lets her in, scolding the receptionist for making her wait outside.

Although Wei has no money to run an ad on TV, the station manager is interested in her story and decides to feature Wei in a talk show special about rural education. On the talk show, Wei is nervous and hardly says a word when the host (Li Fanfan) addresses her, but Zhang—who has been wandering the streets begging for food—sees the show. After Wei and Zhang are reunited, the station manager arranges to have them driven back to Shuiquan village, along with a truckload of school supplies and donations that viewers had sent in. Upon their return, they are greeted by the whole village. In the final scene, Wei presents the students with several boxes of colored chalk that were donated, and allows each student to write one character on the board. The film ends with a series of title cards that recount the actions of the characters after the film ends, and describe the problem of poverty in rural education in China.

== Themes ==
While most of Zhang&#x27;s early films had been historical epics, &quot;Not One Less&quot; was one of the first to focus on contemporary China. The film&#x27;s main theme involves the difficulties faced in providing rural education in China. When Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village, the teacher Gao has not been paid in six months and the school building is in disrepair, and chalk is in such short supply that Gao gives Wei specific instructions limiting how large her written characters should be. Wei sleeps in the school building, sharing a bed with several female students. The version of the film released overseas ends with a series of title cards in English, the last of which reads, &quot;Each year, poverty forces one million children in China to leave school. Through the help of donations, about 15% of these children return to school.&quot;
Because the people and locations used in the film are real but are carefully selected and edited, the film creates a &quot;friction&quot; between documentary reality and narrative fiction. This balancing act between the real and the imaginary has drawn comparisons to neorealist works such as those of Iranian directors Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf, and Zhang has openly acknowledged the influence of Kiarostami in this film. Zhang Xiaoling of the University of Nottingham argues that Zhang Yimou used the documentary perspective in order to suggest that the story is an accurate reflection of most rural areas in China, while Shelly Kraicer believes that his &quot;simultaneous presentation of seemingly opposing messages&quot; is a powerful artistic method in of itself, and that it allows Zhang to circumvent censors by guaranteeing that the movie will include at least one message that they like. Jean-Michel Frodon of &quot;Le Monde&quot; maintains that the film was produced &quot;in the shadow of two superpowers&quot; and needed to make compromises with each.

The film addresses the prominent place that bureaucracy, and verbal negotiation and struggle, occupy in everyday life in China. Many scenes pit Wei against authority figures such as the village mayor, the announcer in the train station, and the TV station receptionist who also acts as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot;. Aside from Wei, many characters in the film show a &quot;blind faith&quot; in authority figures. While she lacks money and power, Wei overcomes her obstacles through sheer obstinacy and ignorant persistence, suggesting that speech and perseverance can overcome barriers. Wei becomes an example of &quot;heroic obstinacy&quot; and a model of using determination to face &quot;overwhelming odds&quot;. For this reason, the film has been frequently compared to Zhang&#x27;s 1993 &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot;, whose heroine is also a determined, stubborn woman; likewise, &quot;Qiu Ju&quot; is also filmed in a neo-realistic style, set partially in contemporary rural China and partially in the city, and employs mostly amateur actors.

&quot;Not One Less&quot; portrays the mass media as a locus of power: Wei discovers that only someone with money or connections can gain access to a television station, but once someone is on camera she or he becomes part of an &quot;invisible media hegemony&quot; with the power to &quot;manipulate social behavior&quot;, catching people&#x27;s attention where paper advertisements could not and moving cityfolk to donate money to a country school. The power of television within the film&#x27;s story, according to Laikwan Pang of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reflects its prominent place in Chinese society of the late 1990s, when domestic cinema was floundering but television was developing quickly; Pang argues that television-watching forms a &quot;collective consciousness&quot; for Chinese citizens, and that the way television unifies people in &quot;Not One Less&quot; is an illustration of this.
Money is important throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate much of the film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students&#x27; attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei&#x27;s search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or by the promise of a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei&#x27;s problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.

Finally, the film illustrates the growing urban–rural divide in China. When Wei reaches Zhangjiakou, the film creates a clear contrast between urban and rural life, and the two locations are physically separated by a dark tunnel. The city is not portrayed as idyllic; rather, Zhang shows that rural people are faced with difficulties and discrimination in the cities. While Wei&#x27;s first view of the city exposes her to well-dressed people and modern buildings, the living quarters she goes to while searching for Zhang Huike are cramped and squalid. Likewise, the iron gate where Wei waits all day for the TV station director reflects the barriers poor people face to survival in the city, and the necessity of connections to avoid becoming an &quot;outsider&quot; in the city. Frequent cuts show Wei and Zhang wandering aimlessly in the streets, Zhang begging for food, and Wei sleeping on the sidewalk; when an enthusiastic TV host later asks Zhang what part of the city left the biggest impression, Zhang replies that the one thing he will never forget is having to beg for food. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the &quot;unbearable&quot; despair of the film&#x27;s second half to that of Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s 1948 &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;.

== Reception ==

=== Cannes withdrawal ===

Neither &quot;Not One Less&quot; nor Zhang&#x27;s other 1999 film &quot;The Road Home&quot; was selected for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Official Selection, the most prestigious competition in the festival, where several of Zhang&#x27;s earlier films had won awards. The rationale is uncertain; Shelly Kraicer and Zhang Xiaoling claim that Cannes officials viewed the &quot;Not One Less&quot;″ happy ending, with the main characters&#x27; conflicts resolved by the generosity of city dwellers and higher-up officials, as pro-China propaganda, while Zhu Ying claims that the officials saw it and &quot;The Road Home&quot; as too &quot;anti&quot;-government. Rather than have his films shown in a less competitive portion of the festival, Zhang withdrew them both in protest, stating that the movies were apolitical. In an open letter published in the &quot;Beijing Youth Daily&quot;, Zhang accused the festival of being motivated by other than artistic concerns, and criticized the Western perception that all Chinese films must be either &quot;pro-government&quot; or &quot;anti-government&quot;, referring to it as a &quot;discrimination against Chinese films&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Not One Less&quot; has an approval rating of 96% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 47 reviews, and an average rating of 7.6/10.Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generaly favourable reviews&quot;. 

Many focused on the film&#x27;s ending title cards: several compared them to a public service announcement, and Philip Kemp of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; wrote, &quot;All that&#x27;s missing is the address we should send donations to.&quot; Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism of the state of rural education in China, saying, &quot;the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: what about the remaining 85 percent?&quot; The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction to the rest of the film&#x27;s resolution. Kemp described the ending as &quot;feelgood&quot; and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Desson Howe called the ending &quot;flag-waving&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Gilbert Adair called it &quot;sugary&quot;. Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a &quot;strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children&quot;. Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its subtext is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist&#x27;s callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese &quot;bureaucratism and nepotism&quot;, and that for all the good things about the city, Zhang Huike&#x27;s clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are missing the point and, as Kraicer put it, &quot;mistaking [one] layer as the message of the film ... mistaking the part for the whole&quot;. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; and Leigh Paatsch of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; each pointed out that, while the film is &quot;deceptive[ly]&quot; positive at face value, it has harsh criticism &quot;bubbling under the surface&quot;. Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of &quot;Movie Review&quot; recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government&#x27;s handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of &quot;Film Appreciation&quot;, on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said that &quot;Not One Less&quot; marked the beginning of Zhang&#x27;s transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government&#x27;s favorites.

Overall, critics were impressed with the performances of the amateur actors, and Jean-Michel Frodon of &quot;Le Monde&quot; called that the film&#x27;s greatest success. Peter Rainer of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; praised the scene of Wei&#x27;s interview on TV as &quot;one of the most improbably satisfying love scenes on film&quot;. The film also received praise for its artistic merits and Hou Yong&#x27;s cinematography, even though its visuals were simplistic compared to Zhang&#x27;s previous films; for example, A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;richness&quot; displayed by the film despite its deliberate scarcity of color. Reviewers also pointed out that Zhang had succeeded in breaking away from the &quot;commercial entertainment wave&quot; of popular film. Noel Vera of &quot;BusinessWorld&quot; writes that the film concerns itself mainly with emotional impact, at the expense of visual extravagance, making it the opposite of earlier Zhang Yimou films such as &quot;Red Sorghum&quot;. Other critics noted the strength of the film&#x27;s storytelling; for instance, Rainer called the film an &quot;uncommon, and uncommonly moving, love story&quot;, and &quot;Film Journal International&quot;″s Kevin Lally described it as &quot;a poignant story of poverty and spirit reminiscent of the great Italian neo-realists.&quot; Another well-received part of the film was the segment in which Wei teaches math by creating practical examples out of her attempt to raise money for the bus to Zhangjiakou; in the Chinese journal &quot;Teacher Doctrines&quot;, Mao Wen wrote that teachers should learn from Wei&#x27;s example and provide students with practical exercises.

Wei Minzhi&#x27;s character received mixed reactions: Scott described her as a &quot;heroic&quot; character who demonstrates how obstinacy can be a virtue, whereas Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; says she is &quot;no brighter or more resourceful than [her students]&quot;. Reactions to the city portion of the movie were also mixed: while Zhang describes the second half of the film as an eloquent commentary on China&#x27;s urban-rural divide and Kevin Lally calls it &quot;startling&quot;, Kemp criticizes it for being a predictable &quot;Victorian cliché&quot;.

=== Box office and release ===

Rights to distribute the film were purchased by the China Film Group Corporation, a state-sponsored organization, and the government actively promoted the film. It was officially released in mainland China in , although there were showings as early as mid-February. Sheldon H. Lu reports that the film grossed ¥18 million, an average amount, in its first three months of showing; by the end of its run in November, it sold ¥40 million at the box office. (In comparison, Zhang&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Hero&quot; would earn ¥270 million three years later.) Nevertheless, &quot;Not One Less&quot; was the highest-grossing domestic film of 1999, and Laikwan Pang has called it a &quot;box office success&quot;. In the United States, the film was released in theaters on 2000, and grossed $50,256 in its first weekend and $592,586 overall; The release was handled by Sony Pictures Classics, and home video distribution by Columbia TriStar; &quot;Not One Less&quot; was Columbia&#x27;s first Chinese film.

Lu warns that domestic box office sales are not reliable indicators of a film&#x27;s popularity in mainland China, because of piracy and because of state or social group sponsorship; many workers were given free tickets to promote the film, and a 1999 report claimed that more tickets were purchased by the government than by individuals. The film was more popular than most government-promoted films touting the party line and Lu claims that it had &quot;tremendous social support&quot;, but Pang points out that its success was &quot;not purely egalitarian, but partly constructed.&quot;

At the time of &quot;Not One Less&quot;″ release, DVD and VCD piracy was a growing concern in mainland China, and the China Copyright Office issued a notice forbidding unauthorized production or distribution of the film. This was the first time China had enacted special copyright protections for a domestic film. On 1999, Hubei province&#x27;s Culture Office issued an &quot;Urgent Notice for Immediate Confiscation of Pirated &quot;Not One Less&quot; VCDs&quot;, and two days later the Culture Office and movie company joined forces to conduct raids on ten audio-video stores, seizing pirated discs from six of them.

=== Awards ===
Although it was withdrawn from Cannes, &quot;Not One Less&quot; went on to win the Golden Lion, the top award at the Venice Film Festival. Zhang also received a best director award at the Golden Rooster, mainland China&#x27;s most prestigious award ceremony, and the film was voted one of the top three of the year in the Hundred Flowers Awards. Awards the film won or was nominated for are listed below.

<doc id="1128657" wikidata="Q762100" url="?curid=1128657" title="Jouef">
<text>Jouef is a French brand and former manufacturing company specialized in scale model railroads. The brand name is currently owned by Hornby.

Apart from model railroads, the company also produced model cars and slot cars.

==History==
Manufacturer Georges Huard founded Jouef in 1944 toward the end of World War II. The traditional home of the company was in Champagnole, France. In the early 1950s, as with many manufacturers, the company abandoned the use of lithographed tinplate for trains in favour of plastic injection moulding.

In 1979, Jouef opened a factory in Limerick, Ireland, but the ill-fated venture closed in 1981. In 2001, Jouef was subsumed by the Italian Lima. After Lima shut down in January 2004, the Jouef brand was acquired a few months later by Hornby Railways.

== Trains ==

The company&#x27;s first offering was a rather toy-like tinplate &#x27;Trans Saharan Express - Algiers to Tombouctou&#x27;. Other notable offerings were the French BB9200 which hauled the famous &#x27;Le capitole&#x27; express. The locomotive had features like the overhead, diamond-shaped, pantograph completely detailed on the model&#x27;. Even today, as a part of Hornby, a main offering has been the French TGV high-speed express. Also during the 1960s, Jouef marketed a limited range of British outline model railways under the brand name &#x27;Playcraft&#x27;.

== Cars ==
Around 1960, Jouef made a series of plastic 1:87 (HO) scale cars, trucks and buses mainly for display with its train kits. These were mainly French vehicles including a Peugeot 203 and 403, Simca Chambord, Citroen DS 19, and a few Renaults including the 16 hatchback. These were basic one-piece mouldings with simple plastic wheels.

Jouef made electric slot cars for many years with production starting in their Champagnole factory in 1963. The system was called &quot;Record 64&quot; in France. Between 1964 and 1968 these sets were marketed in England by Mettoy / Playcraft, the makers of Corgi Toys. The range was also made under license in Germany and known as Egger Silberpfeil. Jouef slot cars were also manufactured in Spain during the 1960s. Early releases were the E Type Jag sports and hardtop, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL sports and hardtop, BRM F1, BRM F1 chrome, Ferrari F1, Ferrari F1 gold, Lotus F1, Ferrari 250 GTO, Porsche 904 and Ford GT40. A &#x27;Formulae Bleue&#x27; car was illustrated in the 1964 French catalogue, but was never released. After Jouefs&#x27; partnership with Playcraft and Egger ended in 1968, they continued to produce some very nice cars. Toward the end of production, however, cost saving measures became apparent.
From 1968 until 1980 Jouef produced variants of the following cars: Renault Alpine 3000, Matra Djet, Chaparral 2F, Mini Cooper, Renault 8 Gordini, Lotus F1 &#x27;Looping&#x27;, Matra F1 &#x27;Looping&#x27;, Lotus F1 front wing, Lotus F1 front &amp; rear wing, Matra F1 front wing, Matra F1 front &amp; rear wing, BRM F1 &#x27;Baby&#x27; (winged), Ferrari F1 &#x27;Baby&#x27; (winged), Drag Car, Go-Kart, Ford Capri, Renault 5, Porsche 917, Matra 650, &#x27;Niki Lauda&#x27; Ferrari, Ligier JS1, Renault F1, Ligier JS11, Carabo Bertone, Alfetta GTV2000, Porsche Carrera Turbo, BMW 3.0 csl, Renault Alpine 1600, Fiat 131 Abarth, Alpine A442, Porsche 936, Matra Simca Bagheera, Renault Alpine A310, Porsche 911S and Lancia Stratos. Jouef ceased producing their own cars in 1980. A Renault 5 Turbo with flared arches and a &#x27;Batwing&#x27; BMW were featured in the 1980 catalogue, but neither entered production.

Thereafter, Artin would sell their own budget range of slot cars under the Jouef brand name right up until the mid 1990s. Jouef slot cars and accessories made in the French factories between 1963 and 1980 are now much sought after by collectors, some of the rarer liveries command very high prices.

During the 1990s, Jouef also made die cast cars in 1:18, 1:24, and 1:43 scales under the name &quot;JouefEvolution&quot;. The car models were most often made in China, though train production continued in France. The 1:43 scale series was called &#x27;Legende&#x27; and cars included a 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera, Ferrari 330 P4 Prototype racer, a Ferrari NART 412P Prototype racer, 250 Ferraris, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta in Le Mans and Tour de France liveries, a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO, a Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione, a Ford GT, a 1965 Mustang, a 1994 Ford Mustang, an MGB ragtop, a Triumph TR3 and a 1978 Volkswagen Beetle.

Proportions on these 1990s cars were spot-on (pun partially intended) and detail was exquisite. Engine features were realistic, wheels with their precise metal shades and textures often looked just like they had been taken off the real car and put into a &#x27;miniaturizing&#x27; machine. Even on opening doors, window frames were made of thin metal, precision not often seen in 1:43 scale.

Most of these castings, like the 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2,7 litre or the many variations of the Ford GT race car, were later acquired by Universal Hobbies of Kowloon, Hong Kong and marketed during the late 1990s as the Eagle&#x27;s Race line, which featured a silver chrome-like Eagle on the company logo. They were almost identical to the Jouef offerings.

<doc id="1128659" wikidata="Q1888467" url="?curid=1128659" title="Southfleet">
<text>Southfleet is a small village and civil parish in the borough of Dartford in Kent, England. The village is located three miles southwest of Gravesend, while the parish includes within its boundaries the hamlets of Betsham and Westwood.

Southfleet takes its name from the River Fleet, a minor tributary of the River Thames. The water that supplied the river came from a place called Springhead, where there were watercress and oyster beds; the river then flowed through Southfleet, Ebbsfleet and Northfleet.

==Notable buildings==
The village is grouped around a crossroads and many of its buildings, including the Ship Inn, are extremely old. The parish church of St Nicholas has 14th-century origins, although pre-Roman Christian remains have been found in the area. The church has memorials of the Sedley, Swan, and Peyton families. 

==Governance==
Southfleet fell within the Hundred of Axstane. The Local Government Act 1972 made the parish part of the borough of Dartford of Kent in 1974. The settlement of New Barn in the south of the parish was transferred to Longfield and New Barn parish in 1987.

==Transport==
Southfleet had a railway station on the Gravesend West Line, which operated from 1886 to 1953. The section of the trackbed south of the A2 road of that closed line was used by Eurostar services to London Waterloo.

Currently, the closest railway station to Southfleet is on the Chatham Main Line, located approximately 2.3 miles from the village. The station provides rail services to London, The Medway Towns, Dover and Ramsgate.

The village is currently served by the Go-Coach routes 474/475 buses as well as the Arriva Kent Thameside route 489. These services provide connections to Gravesend, Bluewater, Longfield and New Ash Green.

<doc id="1128661" wikidata="Q459889" url="?curid=1128661" title="Tears of the Sun">
<text>Tears of the Sun is a 2003 American action thriller film directed by Antoine Fuqua. It depicts a fictitious U.S. Navy SEAL team rescue mission amidst the 21st-century version of the civil war in Nigeria. Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) commands the team sent to rescue U.S. citizen Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) before the approaching rebels reach her jungle hospital.

Willis produced &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; through Cheyenne Enterprises, his production company.

==Plot==
A coup d&#x27;état led by exiled General Mustafa Yakubu overthrows the President of Nigeria Samuel Azuka, sending Nigeria into chaos and causing an ethnic conflict between the Fulani Muslims and the Christian Igbo. Samuel and his family are assassinated, and foreigners are evacuated from the country.

Aboard the &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;, a Navy Seal team, led by A.K. Waters, is tasked by Captain Bill Rhodes to extract Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks. She is a U.S. citizen by marriage to the late Dr. John Kendricks who was killed by rebels in Sierra Leone. Also the mission&#x27;s priest and two nuns are also authorised to come, if they so choose.

The team reaches Kendricks, who refuses to leave without her patients. Waters calls Rhodes for options; after a conversation, he concedes to Kendricks&#x27; wishes and agrees to take those refugees who can walk. Kendricks begins assembling the able-bodied; the priest and the nuns stay behind to care for the injured.

Irritated and behind schedule, the team and the refugees leave the hospital mission at daybreak. At nightfall, they take a break when rebels approach their position, and Waters stealthily kills one to prevent them from being discovered. Kendricks warns Waters that the rebels are heading to the mission, but he is determined to carry out his orders, so they continue to the extraction point. At the mission, the staff and refugees are detained by the rebels. Despite the priest&#x27;s pleas for mercy, they murder him and the remaining occupants.

When the team arrives at the extraction point, Waters&#x27; initial plan becomes clear: the SEALs turn away the refugees from the waiting helicopter. Waters forces Kendricks into the helicopter against her will, leaving the refugees stranded in the jungle, defenseless against the rebels. En route back to the &quot;Harry Truman&quot;, they fly over the original mission compound, seeing it destroyed and all its occupants murdered.

Remorseful, Waters orders the pilot to return to the refugees. He loads as many as he can into the helicopter and decides to escort the remaining ones to the Cameroon border. En route, the SEALs discover the rebels are tracking them. The team enters a village whose inhabitants are being massacred. Waters and his team kill the rebels, but are shaken by the atrocities they have seen committed against the villagers.

Realizing the rebels are approaching their position, the SEALs conclude that a refugee is transmitting their location. One of the recently arrived ones, Gideon, is the informant and tries to run but is shot by Silk. He was bugged with a transmitter.

Suspicious, the SEAL&#x27;s search for his co-conspirators reveals the presence of Arthur Azuka, the surviving son of Samuel Azuka. The rebels are hunting them as Samuel was not only the president of the country but also the tribal king of the Ibo. As the only surviving member of this royal bloodline, Arthur is the only person with a legitimate claim to the Ibo nation.

The SEALs decide to continue escorting the refugees to Cameroon. A firefight ensues when the rebels catch up with them, and the SEALs decide to stay behind as rearguard to buy the refugees enough time to reach the border. Slo, Lake, Flea, and Silk die in the firefight, and Zee calls in for air support. Waters, Red, Doc, and Zee are wounded but direct the jets on where to attack the rebels. Air support wipes out the rebels as Rhodes arrives at the border with reinforcements. He orders the gate open, letting in the SEALs and refugees.

Rhodes promises Waters that he will recover the bodies of Waters&#x27; men. Kendricks bids farewells to her Nigerian friends and flies away in a helicopter while comforting Waters, watching as Arthur is surrounded by his people proclaiming their freedom.

The cast included African refugees living in the United States, some of whom were from the group known as the &#x27;Lost Boys of Sudan&#x27;.

==Production==
Harry Humphries, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, was the technical adviser to the film, having advised the earlier &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. According to the Blu-ray factoid, the aircraft carrier scenes were filmed aboard the active USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;, east of Cape Hatteras in the Atlantic Ocean. The Navy repeatedly turned the carrier so that director Fuqua would have beneficial lighting conditions. The story is based on a mission of the Canadian Joint Task Force Two (JTF2) that took place in Colombia. An ex-member of the commando wrote the original story and suggested it when he met the production team of &quot;Executive Decision&quot; (1996) on a set in Nevada.

Fuqua has stated that he and Bruce Willis did not get along with each other during the making of this film.

==Release==
The movie was released in U.S. theaters on March 7, 2003, having premiered earlier on March 3. The 20-minutes longer &quot;Director&#x27;s Extended Cut&quot; was released on DVD in 2005 and begins with the killing of the Nigerian president, adding political context. The Blu-ray theatrical cut was released in September 2006, containing low-definition deleted scenes instead of that extended cut.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; holds an approval rating of 33% based on 155 reviews and an average rating of 4.93/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states that the film &quot;tries to be high-minded, but in the end, it&#x27;s just a stylish action movie.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and said, &quot;&quot;Tears of the Sun&quot; is a film constructed out of rain, cinematography and the face of Bruce Willis. These materials are sufficient to build a film almost as good as if there had been a better screenplay.&quot;

===Director’s opinion===
In retrospect, Antoine Fuqua shares his frustration with Tears of the Sun&#x27;s production. He initially wanted to tell a raw, realistic story about human suffering in war, especially focusing on the African crisis. However, he faced pressure from the studio to make the film more commercially viable. Fuqua said, “There was an opportunity to say something real,” but as production went on, he felt the studio shifted gears, saying, &quot;It got very real... and all of a sudden people started saying, &#x27;Wow, we want to make sure this makes money, we want to market this, it needs to be more of an action movie.&#x27;&quot; Fuqua explains that the focus on action undermined the film’s original humanitarian message: “It became very frustrating for me because I found myself doing more of an action movie, which is not what I wanted to do.”
Regarding his collaboration with Bruce Willis, Fuqua admits their visions clashed, making their working relationship difficult. He said, “Bruce got pissed. I got pissed. We saw two different movies.” He also acknowledged the challenge of working with a star of Willis’s stature: &quot;He&#x27;s the bigger star. It&#x27;s hard to fight that. People pay to see him.&quot; Fuqua felt this dynamic, combined with their differing creative visions, created tension on set, ultimately forcing him to make compromises on the film’s direction.

<doc id="1128669" wikidata="Q407879" url="?curid=1128669" title="Lead(II) oxide">
<text>Lead(II) oxide, also called lead monoxide, is the inorganic compound with the molecular formula PbO. It occurs in two polymorphs: litharge having a tetragonal crystal structure, and massicot having an orthorhombic crystal structure. Modern applications for PbO are mostly in lead-based industrial glass and industrial ceramics, including computer components.

== Types ==
Lead oxide exists in two polymorphs:
* Red tetragonal (α-PbO), obtained at temperatures below 
* Yellow orthorhombic (β-PbO), obtained at temperatures above 

==Synthesis==
PbO may be prepared by heating lead metal in air at approximately . At this temperature it is also the end product of decomposition of other oxides of lead in air:
:&lt;chem&gt;PbO2-&gt;[{293 °C}] Pb12O19 -&gt;[{351 °C}] Pb12O17 -&gt;[{375 °C}] Pb3O4 -&gt;[{605 °C}] PbO&lt;/chem&gt;

Thermal decomposition of lead(II) nitrate or lead(II) carbonate also results in the formation of PbO:
:2  → 2 PbO + 4  + 
: → PbO + 

PbO is produced on a large scale as an intermediate product in refining raw lead ores into metallic lead. The usual lead ore is galena (lead(II) sulfide). At a temperature of around in air, the sulfide converted to the oxide:

=== From lead ===
Lead combusts at high temperature. According to the Barton pot method, refined molten lead droplets are oxidized under a forced air flow which carries them out to the separation system (e.g. cyclonic separators) for further processing. Oxides produced by this method are mostly a mixture of α-PbO and β-PbO. The overall reaction, which is conducted at 450 °C is:
Using a Ball mill, lead balls are oxidized in a cooled rotating drum. The oxidation is achieved by collisions of the balls. Just like in Barton pot method, the supply of air and separators may also be used.

==Structure==
As determined by X-ray crystallography, both polymorphs, tetragonal and orthorhombic feature a pyramidal four-coordinate lead center. In the tetragonal form the four lead–oxygen bonds have the same length, but in the orthorhombic two are shorter and two longer. The pyramidal nature indicates the presence of a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons. When PbO occurs in tetragonal lattice structure it is called litharge; and when the PbO has orthorhombic lattice structure it is called massicot. The PbO can be changed from massicot to litharge or vice versa by controlled heating and cooling. The tetragonal form is usually red or orange color, while the orthorhombic is usually yellow or orange, but the color is not a very reliable indicator of the structure. The tetragonal and orthorhombic forms of PbO occur naturally as rare minerals.

==Reactions==
PbO is reduced to elemental lead when heated under carbon monoxide at around :
:PbO + CO → Pb + 

The red and yellow forms of this material are related by a small change in enthalpy:
:PbO(red) → PbO(yellow) Δ&quot;H&quot; = 1.6 kJ/mol

PbO is amphoteric, which means that it reacts with both acids and with bases. With acids, it forms salts of via the intermediacy of oxo clusters such as . With strong bases, PbO dissolves to form plumbite (also called plumbate(II)) salts:
:PbO + + → 

==Applications==
PbO is used extensively in making glass. Depending on the glass, the benefit of using PbO in glass can be one or more of increasing the refractive index of the glass, increasing the dispersion (i. e. reducing the Abbe number) of the glass, decreasing the viscosity of the glass, increasing the electrical resistivity of the glass, and increasing the ability of the glass to absorb X-rays. Adding PbO to industrial ceramics (as well as glass) makes the materials more magnetically and electrically inert (by raising their Curie temperature) and it is often used for this purpose. Historically PbO was also used extensively in ceramic glazes for household ceramics, and it is still used, but not extensively any more. Other less dominant applications include the vulcanization of rubber and the production of certain pigments and paints. PbO is used in cathode-ray tube glass to block X-ray emission, but mainly in the neck and funnel of the tube, because it can cause discoloration when used in the faceplate. Strontium oxide and Barium oxide are preferred for the faceplate.

The consumption of lead, and hence the processing of PbO, correlates with the number of automobiles, because lead remains the key component of automotive lead–acid batteries.

===Niche or declining uses===
A mixture of PbO with glycerine sets to a hard, waterproof cement that has been used to join the flat glass sides and bottoms of aquariums, and was also once used to seal glass panels in window frames. It is a component of lead paints.

PbO was one of the raw materials for century eggs, a type of Chinese preserved egg. but it has been gradually replaced due to health problems. It was an unscrupulous practice in some small factories but it became rampant in China and forced many honest manufacturers to label their boxes &quot;lead-free&quot; after the scandal went mainstream in 2013.

In powdered tetragonal litharge form, it can be mixed with linseed oil and then boiled to create a weather-resistant sizing used in gilding. The litharge would give the sizing a dark red color that made the gold leaf appear warm and lustrous, while the linseed oil would impart adhesion and a flat durable binding surface.

PbO is used in certain condensation reactions in organic synthesis.

PbO is the input photoconductor in a video camera tube called the Plumbicon.

==Health issues==
Lead oxide is toxic and irritate to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. It affects gum tissue, the central nervous system, the kidneys, the blood, and the reproductive system. It can bioaccumulate in plants and in mammals.

<doc id="1128670" wikidata="Q12282497" url="?curid=1128670" title="Kamenitza">
<text>Kamenitza () is one of the top-selling Bulgarian beer companies based in the city of Haskovo. It was established in 1881 and is currently owned by the multinational Molson Coors. The brewery has a wide variety of lager and dark beers. Its slogan is &quot;Mazhete znayat zashto&quot; which translates to &quot;Men know why.&quot;

Kamenitza had an 18% share of the Bulgarian beer market in 2005 according to data from ACNielsen. The company is a sponsor of the Bulgaria national football team.

Kamenitza currently has six brands: Light (4.4% ABV), Dark (6% ABV), non-alcoholic, wheat and Fresh (lemon- and grapefruit-flavoured, 2.1% ABV).

==History==

In 1881 three Swiss entrepreneurs built a brewery in Plovdiv on a hill called Kamenitza and used the name as their brand. The drink of choice for most Bulgarians at the time was lager, but Kamenitza broke new ground by producing the first dark beer for the market. By the 1890s they won awards at international exhibitions, including Brussels and Chicago.

The communist regime nationalised Kamenitza: first, in 1947, as part of the state-owned &quot;Alcoholic Beverages&quot;, then in 1952 as part of &quot;Vinprom&quot;.

The Belgian multinational company InBev bought the Bulgarian breweries Kamenitza, Astika and Burgasko Pivo in 1995 and added Plevensko Pivo in 1997. During 1997 to 2005, InBev invested 86.3 million leva in Bulgaria, and in 2005 Kamenitza sold 800,000 hectoliters, making it the best-selling domestic beer. 

In mid October 2009, private equity fund CVC Capital Partners bought all of Anheuser–Busch InBev&#x27;s holdings in Central Europe for €2.23 billion. They renamed the operations StarBev.

Since the early 2010s, Kamenitza bottles have pull-off caps.

<text>Christ of the Ozarks statue is a monumental sculpture of Jesus located near Eureka Springs, Arkansas, atop Magnetic Mountain. It was erected in 1966 as a &quot;Sacred Project&quot; by populist and white supremacist Gerald L. K. Smith. The statue stands high.

==Background==
During the Great Depression, Gerald L. K. Smith served as an organizer for Huey P. Long&#x27;s Share Our Wealth movement and led it briefly following Long&#x27;s assassination in 1935. After many years of highly controversial, religiously charged activism that was primarily characterized by Holocaust denial, virulent racism, antisemitism, and pro-Nazi sympathies, Smith retired to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, where he bought and renovated an old mansion. On other parts of the estate property, he planned a religious theme park, which he called &quot;Sacred Projects&quot;. He commissioned the centerpiece, a gigantic statue of Jesus, completed in 1966. It is called &quot;Christ of the Ozarks&quot;.

He also completed a 4,100-seat amphitheater. This is the site of seasonal annual outdoor performances of &quot;The Great Passion Play&quot;. It is performed 3 nights a week from the last week of May through the end of October.

== Design ==
The statue was primarily the work of Emmet Sullivan, who also worked on nearby Dinosaur World. He had assisted in the work at Mount Rushmore. The statue is modernistic and minimalistic; there is little facial detail or expression, and the lines and forms are generally simplified. The arms are outstretched straight, sixty five feet from the tip of one finger to another, suggesting the Crucifixion; however the cross is not depicted.

It sits on 320 tons of concrete and was designed to withstand winds of 500 miles an hour. The statue, which was completely built by hand out of steel and mortar, is also reinforced in a way to withstand the force of a passing tornado.

It has been nicknamed &quot;Gumby Jesus&quot; and &quot;Our Milk Carton with Arms&quot; by critics.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Christ of the Ozarks&quot; is featured briefly in the 2005 movie &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; and in the 1988 movie &quot;Pass the Ammo&quot;. It is also featured during the intro theme to &quot;True Detective&quot;, Season 3, which was filmed in the Ozarks region of Arkansas. It is featured in a 2018 documentary &quot;The Gospel of Eureka.&quot; The art collective Indecline hung a banner on it in July 2021 that said &quot;God Bless Abortions&quot;; the banner was removed. It was also featured on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; in 2022 while discussing the topic of LGBT rights in Arkansas.

<doc id="1128678" wikidata="Q899314" url="?curid=1128678" title="Lithopone">
<text>Lithopone, C.I. Pigment White 5, is a mixture of inorganic compounds, widely used as a white pigment powder. It is composed of a mixture of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide. These insoluble compounds blend well with organic compounds and confer opacity. It was made popular by the cheap production costs, greater coverage. Related white pigments include titanium dioxide, zinc oxide (&quot;zinc white&quot;), zinc sulfide, and white lead.

== History ==
Lithopone was discovered in the 1870s by DuPont. It was manufactured by Krebs Pigments and Chemical Company and other companies. The material came in different &quot;seals&quot;, which varied in the content of zinc sulfide. Gold seal and Bronze seals contain 40-50% zinc sulfide, offering more hiding power and strength. Although its popularity peaked around 1920, approximately 223,352 tons were produced in 1990. It is mainly used in paints, putty, and in plastics.

===Stability and darkening===
Although barium sulfate is almost completely inert, zinc sulfide degrades upon exposure to UV light, leading to darkening of the pigment. The severity of this UV reaction is dependent on a combination of two factors; how much zinc sulfide makes up the pigments formulation, and its total accumulated UV exposure. Depending on these factors the pigment itself can vary in shade over time, ranging from pure white all the way to grey or even black. To suppress this effect, a dopant may be used, such as a small amount of cobalt salts, which would be added to the formulation. This process creates cobalt-doped zinc sulfide. The cobalt salts help to stabilize zinc sulfide so it will not have as severe a reaction to UV exposure.

== Production ==
Lithopone is produced by coprecipitation of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide. Most commonly coprecipitation is effected by combining equimolar amounts of zinc sulfate and barium sulfide:
: BaS + ZnSO4 → ZnS·BaSO4
This route affords a product that is 29.4 wt % ZnS and 70.6 wt % BaSO4. Variations exist, for example, more ZnS-rich materials are produced when zinc chloride is added to the mixture of zinc sulfate and barium sulfide.

Barium sulfide is produced by carbothermic reduction of barium sulfate. Zinc sulfate is obtained from a variety of zinc products, often waste, by treatment with sulfuric acid.
== Safety ==
Lithopone is rather nontoxic, due to the insolubility of its components. It has been used in medicine as a radiocontrast agent. Lithopone is allowed to be in contact with foodstuffs in the US and Europe.

<text>Sainte-Foy-la-Grande (; ) is a commune in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. It is on the south bank of the Dordogne.

==History==
The town was founded in 1076, near a priory where Sainte Foy was worshipped. The town grew rapidly, and it was renamed to Sainte-Foy-la-Grande in 1363 to distinguish it from towns with similar names in the region. A lot of the town is made from medieval buildings which date back to the 15th century. The town was known for its wine trade and port, where ships left and carried caskets of wine to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

During the French reformation in the 16th century, Sainte-Foy became a centre of Calvinism, known as &quot;Little Geneva&quot;; held by the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion, the town was fought over by both sides. Even after Protestant worship was banned by the 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau, the faith continued to be practised in secret, and in 1828, it became the location of one of the first Protestant schools established in France since 1685.

<doc id="1128683" wikidata="Q1021183" url="?curid=1128683" title="City of Thuringowa">
<text>The City of Thuringowa () was a city and local government area in North Queensland, Australia covering the northern and western parts of what is now Townsville. The suburb of Thuringowa Central is the main business centre in this area.

Thuringowa was named after the German state of Thuringia where the shire&#x27;s first chairman, John von Stieglitz, originated. Prior to its proclamation as a city on 1 January 1986, Thuringowa was a large rural shire, almost surrounding the City of Townsville.

In 2007 the Queensland Government recommended that the Thuringowa City Council and the Townsville City Council be merged as part of the review of councils and boundaries, with the merged entity to be referred to as the Townsville City Council and the city being called the New Townsville City. The transition was completed with the election of a new combined Council on 15 March 2008.

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to European settlement, the Nyawaygi Aboriginal people lived in the area around Thuringowa, Townsville and the Burdekin. The earliest European on record to live in Thuringowa was James Morrill whose boat washed ashore in 1846.

In 1860, the newly formed Queensland Government passed an act opening up the area to pastoral leases, and by 1861 there were many runs in Thuringowa. By 1865, Robert Towns and John Melton Black had purchased a number of properties throughout Thuringowa. In 1865 Robert Towns built a boiling down works – at the time, there was no facilities for shipping cattle or sheep, so in 1865 Andrew Ball and Mark Reid left Woodstock Station to find a harbour around the Cleveland Bay shores and the Town and port of Townsville was established at the mouth of Ross Creek.

===Local government===
The City of Thuringowa had its genesis in the Thuringowa Division, created on 11 November 1879 as one of 74 divisions around Queensland under the &quot;Divisional Boards Act 1879&quot; with a population of 638.

On 16 January 1888, the Ayr Division was created out of Subdivision 3 of the Thuringowa Division in 1888 under the &quot;Divisional Boards Act 1887&quot;.

Considerable progress ensued over the following decades – by 1902, Thuringowa had 1,020 dwellings listed on its ratebooks. Early chairmen Arthur Bundock and Joseph Hodel were involved in construction of key architecture such as the Ross River Bridge, the bridge at the Causeway and the Stuart Creek Bridge. These roads and bridges were constructed to serve not only Thuringowa&#x27;s rural base but also its residential subdivisions of Hermit Park, Mundingburra and Rosslea. Water reticulation and sanitary services were established in these suburbs and street lighting and beautification work was carried out along Charters Towers Road. Also during this period the Council&#x27;s first administration building was constructed at the Causeway, near the intersection of Flinders Street West and Ingham Road.

Under the &quot;Local Authorities Act 1902&quot;, divisions were renamed shires, and on 31 March 1903, Thuringowa Division became the Shire of Thuringowa. The period up to 1918 was one of consolidation and minor works, rather than major projects.

In 1918, much of the Shire of Thuringowa&#x27;s urban area was transferred to Townsville. This initially caused great hardship for the Shire, as its rate base had been reduced to 2,500 ratepayers and its council headquarters was outside the shire. The Council adopted a conservative approach to policy during this period that included not only the depression years of the 1930s but also during World War II, when the area became an important staging point and was host to significant numbers of military personnel.

From the 1960s onwards, significant suburban development and growth took place in the area and the Council was providing new facilities and infrastructure. In 1979, a new Shire administration centre was constructed, moving it back into the local area, and on 1 January 1986, the Shire of Thuringowa became the City of Thuringowa.

In 2007, the state government engaged in a programme of local government reform centred on amalgamating LGAs across Queensland. The Local Government Advisory Committee recommended that the Cities of Thuringowa and Townsville should be amalgamated into a new City of Townsville. Though it was the source of some controversy, the merger ultimately took place, with the City of Thuringowa ceasing to exist in March 2008. Les Tyrell, Thuringowa&#x27;s mayor of 17 years, won against Townsville&#x27;s mayor, 19-year incumbent Tony Mooney, in the mayoral election for the combined city.

==Demographics==
Thuringowa grew in population rapidly from the 1980s becoming one of the fastest-growing cities in Australia. The population had increased from 26,000 in 1986 to over 65,000 in 2007.

<doc id="1128688" wikidata="Q1452593" url="?curid=1128688" title="Freddie and the Dreamers">
<text>Freddie and the Dreamers were an English beat band that had a number of hit records between 1962 and 1965. The band&#x27;s stage act was enlivened by the comic antics of Freddie Garrity, who would bounce around the stage with arms and legs flying.

== History ==
The band, formed in March 1962 in West Didsbury, Manchester, consisted of vocalist Freddie Garrity (1936–2006), guitarist Roy Crewdson (born 1941), guitarist/harmonica player Derek Quinn (1942–2020), bassist Peter Birrell, and drummer Bernie Dwyer (1940–2002). Although the band was grouped as part of the Merseybeat sound phenomenon centred around Liverpool, they came from Manchester. Prior to becoming a singer, Garrity had worked as a milkman in Manchester and bassist Birrell was a shoe salesman.

They had four Top 10 UK hits: a cover of James Ray&#x27;s hit &quot;If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody&quot;, which reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in mid-1963, &quot;I&#x27;m Telling You Now&quot; (number 2 in August), &quot;You Were Made for Me&quot; (number 3 in November) and a cover of The G-Clefs&#x27; &quot;I Understand&quot;, which hit the number 5 spot in November 1964.

Their eponymous debut album was released in the United Kingdom in 1963, peaking at number five in the UK Albums Chart and reaching number 19 in the US albums chart on 22 May 1965. It was the only LP by the group to chart in America; their subsequent four albums in the UK failed to chart.

On stage, the group performed rehearsed, synchronised wacky dance routines. They appeared in four British films: &quot;What a Crazy World&quot; with Joe Brown, &quot;Just for You&quot;, &quot;Cuckoo Patrol&quot; with Kenneth Connor and Victor Maddern and &quot;Every Day&#x27;s A Holiday&quot; (US title &quot;Seaside Swingers&quot;) with Mike Sarne, Ron Moody and John Leyton.

Between 1968 and 1973, Garrity and Birrell appeared in the UK ITV children&#x27;s show &quot;Little Big Time&quot;, a zany music/talent/adventure show with audience participation.

Garrity and Birrell formed a new version of Freddie and the Dreamers in the mid-1970s, releasing three albums on the Arny&#x27;s Shack label in 1976, 1978 and 1983, although Birrell had left before the third release.

== Legacy ==
In the 1980 &quot;Rolling Stone History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Lester Bangs wrote of the group:
== Founding members ==
*Freddie Garrity – vocals (1962–2000; died 2006)
*Derek Quinn – lead guitar (1962–1971; died 2020)
*Roy Crewdson – rhythm guitar (1962–1971)
*Pete Birrell – bass (1962–1971; 1974–1980s)
*Bernie Dwyer – drums (1962–1971; died 2002)

<doc id="1128690" wikidata="Q1370777" url="?curid=1128690" title="Kaori Iida">
<text>is a Japanese pop singer and actress, associated with Hello! Project and best known as a founding member of the girl band Morning Musume. She has also recorded with the Morning Musume side project band Tanpopo and is currently a solo artist. During her time in the group, she was the tallest member (168 cm), earning her the nickname &quot;Kaorin&quot; &amp; &quot;Kao-tan&quot;.
She is currently a member of Dream Morning Musume.

== Biography ==

Kaori Iida was born in Hokkaidō. She was one of 10 runners-up in a 1997 talent contest for a new Japanese rock idol. After the contest, musician and producer Tsunku offered Iida and four of the other runners-up (Natsumi Abe, Yuko Nakazawa, Aya Ishiguro, and Asuka Fukuda) the chance to be taken under his wing on one condition: that they sell 50,000 CDs of their song &quot;Ai no Tane&quot; in 5 days. The quintet accomplished that task in four and, thus, in 1997, Morning Musume was born (and their first official single &quot;Morning Coffee&quot; was released in 1998). The group has since been increasingly popular in Japan, has achieved a cult following in the Western world and is infamous for its fluctuation of memberships, with members &quot;graduating&quot; and joining frequently.

In 1998, Tsunku placed Iida into subgroup Tanpopo with Aya Ishiguro and 2nd generation Morning Musume member Mari Yaguchi, and they specialized in singing slower, more mature songs. Together they made four singles and an album. After Ishiguro graduated from Morning Musume and Tanpopo in January 2000, Iida and Yaguchi performed Tanpopo songs as a duet until Tsunku placed 4th generation Morning Musume members Ai Kago and Rika Ishikawa into the subgroup. Tanpopo&#x27;s style was also given a revamping, with songs being more upbeat and pop-ish, but nonetheless still slower than Morning Musume. In this formation, Tanpopo released 3 more singles, a compilation album, and a compilation DVD.

After Morning Musume&#x27;s then-leader Yuko Nakazawa graduated in the Spring of 2001, Iida took on the role as the group&#x27;s leader. Additionally, when Morning Musume &quot;split&quot; into 2 subgroups in 2003—Iida was leader of Morning Musume Otomegumi. She is also known for keeping her hair long throughout her Morning Musume career and also for spacing out frequently.

In July 2002, Tanpopo, along with other Morning Musume subgroups Petitmoni and Minimoni, experienced changes in their membership - partly due to graduating Morning Musume members and partly to showcase the newer members. As a result, Iida (along with Mari and Ai K.) graduated from Tanpopo.

As with Hello! Project&#x27;s shuffle groups, Iida was placed in punk-rock Aoiro 7 in 2000, folky festival style 10-nin Matsuri in 2001 and Odoru 11 in 2002, and ska-punk 11Water in 2003. She also participated in the 2004 summer shuffle group H.P. All Stars. In 2005, she participated in the shuffle group Puripuri Pink. She is the only member of Hello! Project to have participated in all the shuffle groups since the tradition started.

Additionally, Iida is pursuing a solo career as an artist and singer. Her solo musical career includes two albums outside of Hello! Project where she sings covers of French, Greek, and Italian songs (in their respective languages). She also has two singles in Japanese, released in advance of her impending graduation from Morning Musume—though still set in a Mediterranean-esque style; many Western fans of Morning Musume and Hello! Project have described the style of Iida&#x27;s solo material as &quot;Euro-enka&quot;. In Morning Musume, Iida mostly sang harmony with a few solo lines. Her signature song in Morning Musume is &quot;Yume no Naka&quot;, from the group&#x27;s first album. On December 29, 2004, Iida released her third album, this time within Hello! Project and in Japanese.

On January 30, 2005, Iida—the last First Generation member to still be in Morning Musume—graduated from the group to further pursue her solo singing and art careers. Mari Yaguchi took over her role as Morning Musume&#x27;s leader upon Iida&#x27;s graduation. Her tenure of over 7 years was the longest of any Morning Musume member, a record Iida would hold until January 2009 when fifth generation members Ai Takahashi and Risa Niigaki broke it. As of January 2009, she is one of only four members to remain in the group for over 7 years (4th generation member Hitomi Yoshizawa would later achieve this honor just weeks before her graduation in 2007 and 5th generation members Ai Takahashi and Risa Niigaki reached this mark in mid-September 2008). On December 21, 2005, Iida released Plein D&#x27;amour: Ai ga Ippai, her fourth album. This album featured songs in Japanese and many European cover songs in their original languages. This was her first album to be released since she graduated from Morning Musume.

In early 2007, Iida was chosen to be a member of —a unit created to celebrate Morning Musume&#x27;s 10th anniversary as a group. Morning Musume Tanjō 10nen Kinentai also consists of Natsumi Abe, Maki Goto, Risa Niigaki and Koharu Kusumi. Their first single, , was released on January 24, 2007.

After the death of her son, she stated that in his memory, she will continue her career. She returned to the concert stage at the &quot;Hello! Project 2009 Winter Elder Club: Thank You for Your Love!&quot; series, her first performance in one year and four months. She also performed at the &quot;Hello Pro Award &#x27;09: Elder Club Sotsugyō Kinen Special&quot; concert on February 1, 2009, which celebrated her graduation from Hello! Project along with 21 other Elder Club Members. Beginning in April 2009, she was to be part of &quot;M-Line&quot;, the official Morning Musume graduate fan club. In 2010, it was announced Iida Kaori would join the group &quot;Dream Morning Musume&quot; alongside other former Morning Musume members.

==Personal life==
On July 6, 2007, Iida&#x27;s agency announced that she was ten weeks pregnant and would soon marry Kenji, a former member of the disbanded &quot;7 House&quot;, a band formed by Tsunku. Iida&#x27;s wedding took place the next day. Iida began maternity leave after the &quot;Morning Musume 10th Year Anniversary Concert Tour: Summer &#x27;07 Thank You My Dearest&quot; on September 1, 2007.

On February 3, 2008, Iida released a statement to her fan club that on January 22 at 10:30 am, she had given birth to a baby boy. On November 8 of the same year, she announced that her son had died on July 27 from renal failure.

On December 25, 2012, Iida announced via her blog that she was pregnant with her second child. On May 14, 2013, Iida announced on her blog that she had given birth to a healthy boy. On May 2, 2017, she announced her third pregnancy. On September 19, 2017, Iida gave birth to a baby girl.

<text>A temperature coefficient describes the relative change of a physical property that is associated with a given change in temperature. For a property &quot;R&quot; that changes when the temperature changes by &quot;dT&quot;, the temperature coefficient α is defined by the following equation:
:formula_1
Here α has the dimension of an inverse temperature and can be expressed e.g. in 1/K or K−1.

If the temperature coefficient itself does not vary too much with temperature and formula_2, a linear approximation will be useful in estimating the value &quot;R&quot; of a property at a temperature &quot;T&quot;, given its value &quot;R&quot;0 at a reference temperature &quot;T&quot;0:
:formula_3
where Δ&quot;T&quot; is the difference between &quot;T&quot; and &quot;T&quot;0.

For strongly temperature-dependent α, this approximation is only useful for small temperature differences Δ&quot;T&quot;.

Temperature coefficients are specified for various applications, including electric and magnetic properties of materials as well as reactivity. The temperature coefficient of most of the reactions lies between 2 and 3.

==Negative temperature coefficient==

Most ceramics exhibit negative temperature dependence of resistance behaviour. This effect is governed by an Arrhenius equation over a wide range of temperatures:
:formula_4

where &quot;R&quot; is resistance, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are constants, and &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature (K).

The constant &quot;B&quot; is related to the energies required to form and move the charge carriers responsible for electrical conduction hence, as the value of &quot;B&quot; increases, the material becomes insulating. Practical and commercial NTC resistors aim to combine modest resistance with a value of &quot;B&quot; that provides good sensitivity to temperature. Such is the importance of the &quot;B&quot; constant value, that it is possible to characterize NTC thermistors using the B parameter equation:
:formula_5

where formula_6 is resistance at temperature formula_7.

Therefore, many materials that produce acceptable values of formula_6 include materials that have been alloyed or possess variable negative temperature coefficient (NTC), which occurs when a physical property (such as thermal conductivity or electrical resistivity) of a material lowers with increasing temperature, typically in a defined temperature range. For most materials, electrical resistivity will decrease with increasing temperature.

Materials with a negative temperature coefficient have been used in floor heating since 1971. The negative temperature coefficient avoids excessive local heating beneath carpets, bean bag chairs, mattresses, etc., which can damage wooden floors, and may infrequently cause fires.

==Reversible temperature coefficient==
Residual magnetic flux density or B changes with temperature and it is one of the important characteristics of magnet performance. Some applications, such as inertial gyroscopes and traveling-wave tubes (TWTs), need to have constant field over a wide temperature range. The reversible temperature coefficient (RTC) of B is defined as:
:formula_9

To address these requirements, temperature compensated magnets were developed in the late 1970s. For conventional SmCo magnets, B decreases as temperature increases. Conversely, for GdCo magnets, B increases as temperature increases within certain temperature ranges. By combining samarium and gadolinium in the alloy, the temperature coefficient can be reduced to nearly zero.

==Electrical resistance== 
The temperature dependence of electrical resistance and thus of electronic devices (wires, resistors) has to be taken into account when constructing devices and circuits. The temperature dependence of conductors is to a great degree linear and can be described by the approximation below.
:formula_10

where
:formula_11
formula_12 just corresponds to the specific resistance temperature coefficient at a specified reference value (normally &quot;T&quot; = 0 °C)

That of a semiconductor is however exponential:
:formula_13

where formula_14 is defined as the cross sectional area and formula_15 and formula_16 are coefficients determining the shape of the function and the value of resistivity at a given temperature.

For both, formula_15 is referred to as the &quot;temperature coefficient of resistance&quot; (TCR).

This property is used in devices such as thermistors.

===Positive temperature coefficient of resistance===
A positive temperature coefficient (PTC) refers to materials that experience an increase in electrical resistance when their temperature is raised. Materials which have useful engineering applications usually show a relatively rapid increase with temperature, i.e. a higher coefficient. The higher the coefficient, the greater an increase in electrical resistance for a given temperature increase. A PTC material can be designed to reach a maximum temperature for a given input voltage, since at some point any further increase in temperature would be met with greater electrical resistance. Unlike linear resistance heating or NTC materials, PTC materials are inherently self-limiting. On the other hand, NTC material may also be inherently self-limiting if constant current power source is used.

Some materials even have exponentially increasing temperature coefficient. Example of such a material is PTC rubber.

===Negative temperature coefficient of resistance===
A negative temperature coefficient (NTC) refers to materials that experience a decrease in electrical resistance when their temperature is raised. Materials which have useful engineering applications usually show a relatively rapid decrease with temperature, i.e. a lower coefficient. The lower the coefficient, the greater a decrease in electrical resistance for a given temperature increase. NTC materials are used to create inrush current limiters (because they present higher initial resistance until the current limiter reaches quiescent temperature), temperature sensors and thermistors.

===Negative temperature coefficient of resistance of a semiconductor===
An increase in the temperature of a semiconducting material results in an increase in charge-carrier concentration. This results in a higher number of charge carriers available for recombination, increasing the conductivity of the semiconductor. The increasing conductivity causes the resistivity of the semiconductor material to decrease with the rise in temperature, resulting in a negative temperature coefficient of resistance.

==Temperature coefficient of elasticity==
The elastic modulus of elastic materials varies with temperature, typically decreasing with higher temperature.

==Temperature coefficient of reactivity==
In nuclear engineering, the temperature coefficient of reactivity is a measure of the change in reactivity (resulting in a change in power), brought about by a change in temperature of the reactor components or the reactor coolant. This may be defined as

:formula_18

Where formula_19 is reactivity and &quot;T&quot; is temperature. The relationship shows that formula_20 is the value of the partial differential of reactivity with respect to temperature and is referred to as the &quot;temperature coefficient of reactivity&quot;. As a result, the temperature feedback provided by formula_20 has an intuitive application to passive nuclear safety. A negative formula_20 is broadly cited as important for reactor safety, but wide temperature variations across real reactors (as opposed to a theoretical homogeneous reactor) limit the usability of a single metric as a marker of reactor safety.

In water moderated nuclear reactors, the bulk of reactivity changes with respect to temperature are brought about by changes in the temperature of the water. However each element of the core has a specific temperature coefficient of reactivity (e.g. the fuel or cladding). The mechanisms which drive fuel temperature coefficients of reactivity are different from water temperature coefficients. While water expands as temperature increases, causing longer neutron travel times during moderation, fuel material will not expand appreciably. Changes in reactivity in fuel due to temperature stem from a phenomenon known as doppler broadening, where resonance absorption of fast neutrons in fuel filler material prevents those neutrons from thermalizing (slowing down). 

==Mathematical derivation of temperature coefficient approximation==
In its more general form, the temperature coefficient differential law is:
:formula_23

Where is defined:
:formula_24

And formula_15 is independent of formula_26.

Integrating the temperature coefficient differential law:
:formula_27

Applying the Taylor series approximation at the first order, in the proximity of formula_28, leads to:
:formula_29

==Units==
The thermal coefficient of electrical circuit parts is sometimes specified as ppm/°C, or ppm/K. This specifies the fraction (expressed in parts per million) that its electrical characteristics will deviate when taken to a temperature above or below the operating temperature.

<text>Frederick Rowland Emett OBE (22 October 190613 November 1990), known as Rowland Emett (with the forename sometimes spelled &quot;Roland&quot; [as his middle name appears on his birth certificate] and the surname frequently misspelled &quot;Emmett&quot;), was an English cartoonist and constructor of whimsical kinetic sculpture.

==Early life==
Emett was born in New Southgate, London, the son of a businessman and amateur inventor, and the grandson of Queen Victoria&#x27;s engraver. He was educated at Waverley Grammar School in Birmingham, where he excelled in drawing, caricaturing his teachers and vehicles and machinery. When he was only 14 he took out a patent on a gramophone volume control. He studied at Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts and one of his landscapes, &quot;Cornish Harbour&quot;, was exhibited at the Royal Academy; it is now in the Tate collection.

==Later work==

An otherwise undistinguished career was interrupted by World War II, when he worked as a draughtsman for the Air Ministry while perfecting his gift for drawing cartoons. From 1939 until the 1950s, and less frequently in the 1960s, he published regularly in &quot;Punch&quot; and for many years when his work was published elsewhere it was credited to &quot;Emett of Punch&quot;. His cartoons were seldom political, except when he caricatured bureaucratic absurdities, and his early subjects typically found humour in the difficulties of life in Great Britain during the second World War. His drawings soon started to include railway scenes and he gradually developed a unique concept of strange, bumbling trains with excessively tall chimneys and silly names.

On 12 April 1941 he married Elsie May Evans (who was always known as Mary), the daughter of a Birmingham silversmith. She managed his business interests. They had one daughter, Claire.

In 1947 his cartoons came to life on the stage of the Globe Theatre, London, in &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, a scene for Laurier Lister&#x27;s revue &quot;Tuppence Coloured&quot;, with Max Adrian as an eccentric signalman at Friars Fidgeting Signal Box. In 1951, at the Festival of Britain, his most famous steam locomotive, &quot;Nellie&quot;, was made into a copper and mahogany kinetic sculpture and with two other locomotives, &quot;Neptune&quot; and &quot;Wild Goose&quot;, was one of the festival&#x27;s most popular attractions, operating the Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Branch Railway. There was a fatality when two trains collided. At this time he was living in Cornwall and working in a studio in a boat-loft at Polperro; later he returned to West Cornwall before settling for the rest of his life at Ditchling, in Sussex.

In 1953 Malcolm Muggeridge became editor of &quot;Punch&quot; and began systematic changes, but Emett continued to publish his work there, albeit less frequently. After a spread in &quot;Life&quot; magazine on 5 July 1954, his work was much in demand in the United States. He drew the front cover of the 29 December 1957 &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

He turned more and more to designing and supervising the building of what he called his &quot;things&quot;always with silly names such as &quot;The Featherstone-Kite Openwork Basketweave Mark Two Gentleman’s Flying Machine&quot;, two copies of which exist, one of which was displayed in a glass case in the Merrion Centre, Leeds, the other on permanent display at the Mid-America Science Museum in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1966 he was commissioned by Honeywell to create a mechanical computer, which he named &quot;The Forget-Me-Not Computer&quot;. This was displayed at trade shows and was an exhibition at the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition at the ICA in London in 1968 and finally added to the Ontario Science Centre collection in Toronto. In 1968 he designed the elaborate inventions of Caractacus Potts (played by Dick Van Dyke) for the film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;.

In 1973 his water-powered musical clock, &quot;The Aqua Horological Tintinnabulator&quot;, was installed on the lower floor of the Victoria Centre, Nottingham, until 2010. In 2015 it was reinstalled, refurbished and in full working order, to a new location on the upper mall. When commissioned, it played Rameau&#x27;s Gigue en rondeau II from the E-minor suite of his &quot;Pièces de Clavecin&quot; when striking the hour and half-hour. Later modification enabled it to perform every fifteen minutes (the playback system was changed from tape to compact disc).
A 30-foot-square mosaic by Emett, installed around 1960, can be seen on the side of the NCP car park in The Marlowes, Hemel Hempstead.

The &quot;Cats Cradle Pussiewillow III&quot; clock was commissioned by Basildon New Town and inaugurated by Michael Bentine on 7 August 1981. It is on display at Eastgate Shopping Centre in Basildon.

His larger works, such as &quot;Emettland&quot;, went on extended tours, ending up in prestigious venues such as the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The Ontario Science Centre in Toronto has a collection of about ten Emett creations and every December displays the restored working pieces, usually under the title &quot;Dream Machines&quot;.

The Mid-America Science Museum has had four of his inventions on permanent display for most of the museum&#x27;s existence.

When asked how he came up with his strange designs, Emett remarked, &quot;It is a well known fact that all inventors get their first ideas on the back of an envelope. I take slight exception to this, I use the front so that I can incorporate the stamp and then the design is already half done.&quot;

==Honours==

In the 1978 New Year Honours, described as &quot;Artist and Inventor&quot;, he was awarded an OBE.

==Later life and death==
He died on 13 November 1990 in a Sussex nursing home.

==Legacy==
===Exhibitions===
There is a permanent exhibition of representative examples of Emett&#x27;s work at Stoneywish Nature reserve in Ditchling, East Sussex.

An exhibition of Emett&#x27;s work was held at the Chris Beetles Gallery in London, and an accompanying fully illustrated catalogue written by Jacqui Grossart, entitled &quot;Rowland Emett from &quot;Punch&quot; to &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; and Beyond&quot; (), was published by Chris Beetles Ltd. in 1988.

Until the early 2000s, the &quot;Featherstone-Kite Openwork Basketweave Mark Two Gentleman’s Flying Machine&quot; was on permanent display in the Merrion Centre, Leeds, in England in its own glass display cabinet, activated every 30 minutes TO demonstrate the kinetic functions of the sculpture. It has since been removed from display but is periodically exhibited in the main thoroughfares. Several other Emett sculptures owned by the centre&#x27;s management, including &quot;The Humbug Major Sweet Machine&quot;, &quot;The Fairway Birdie&quot; and the &quot;Clockwork Lullabye Machine&quot;, are now on permanent exhibition on the upper level of the retail centre.

An exhibition entitled &quot;Engines of Enchantment: The Cartoons and Machines of Rowland Emett&quot;, with accompanying lectures (including one by his daughter), was held at The Cartoon Museum in London in 2009.

In 2014, the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery held an exhibition of Rowland Emett&#x27;s cartoons and machines, including the five surviving &#x27;inventions&#x27; from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang (all in working order), television interviews with Emett, and cine-footage of the 1951 Festival of Britain railway. The BMAG cites &quot;This exhibition will be the biggest ever display of Emett&#x27;s work, which is loved by many across the world and will tell the story of his life, living and working in Birmingham.&quot;

In 2022, the Manchester Science and Industry Museum exhibited and demonstrated Emett&#x27;s &quot;A Quiet Afternoon in the Cloud Cuckoo Valley&quot;, a moving sculpture which according to the museum &quot;tells the story of a train journey through Cloud Cuckoo Valley on the fictional Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Railway&quot;.

===Rowland Emett Society===
In 2012 the Rowland Emett Society was formed with the object of allowing &quot;anyone interested in the work of Frederick Rowland Emett to discover more about his remarkable cartoons, artworks and machines&quot;. The Society published a newsletter every two months.

By 2022, the Society appeared to be defunct and its website was no longer responding.
