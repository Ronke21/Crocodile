<text>The 1998 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on 7 June 1998. The 69-lap race was the seventh round of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. It was won by Michael Schumacher, however the race is probably best remembered for the crash on the first lap involving Alexander Wurz, Jean Alesi and Jarno Trulli, which resulted in the race being red flagged and restarted, only for another collision to take place between Alesi and Trulli at the same corner, and the race being started once again under the safety car.

==Report==

===Qualifying===
In Montreal, David Coulthard secured his third pole position of the season, achieving the fastest time at the very end of the session. Mika Häkkinen encountered a lot of traffic during his quick laps. Michael Schumacher was third with a lap time only 0.2 seconds behind Coulthard&#x27;s. The night before qualifying, Eddie Irvine had released a comment saying that the Canadian Grand Prix would be crucial for Ferrari, with Schumacher expressing the same opinion.

===Race===
At the start of the race Michael Schumacher started brilliantly and overtook Mika Häkkinen, whilst his brother Ralf Schumacher stalled. It took two attempts to get the race started as Alexander Wurz precipitated a collision, which somersaulted his Benetton above the gravel trap, into the first turn and involving Jean Alesi and Jarno Trulli as well. This carnage brought out the red flag. The race was stopped and Alesi, Wurz and Trulli all took the restart in their spare cars. Herbert was lucky that his mechanics were able to repair his Sauber, as Alesi took the spare. The only damage to the car proved to be a bent suspension arm.

At the second start, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari got a poor start, and was instantly overtaken by Giancarlo Fisichella. However, even more chaos would ensue. Häkkinen&#x27;s gearbox jammed causing Ralf Schumacher to take avoiding action; he also went across the grass and spun in the middle of the track and then pulled off the track with a broken gearbox. This caused mayhem in the pack behind him. Trulli mounted Alesi&#x27;s car and in total five cars retired after the second start: Häkkinen (gearbox), Ralf Schumacher (spun off), Alesi and Trulli who were involved in the accident, and Toranosuke Takagi who had transmission problems.

Michael Schumacher managed to overtake Giancarlo Fisichella on the first lap but due to all the retirements the safety car was sent out. After five laps, the safety car came back in and the order was, David Coulthard followed by Schumacher, Fisichella, Jacques Villeneuve, Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen.

As the race got under way again, Coulthard and Michael Schumacher started to pull away from the rest of the field. Coulthard led for the first 13 laps until the safety car came out for the second time. Pedro Diniz had gone off the track and when he rejoined he threw a lot of grass and dirt on to the circuit that needed to be removed. When the safety car went back in, there were another three retirements. Mika Salo collided with Johnny Herbert who went off for the second time, and Coulthard had a transmission problem caused by a throttle linkage failure while battling Michael Schumacher for the lead.

The accident involving Salo and Herbert sent out the safety car for a third time, and Michael Schumacher took advantage by making a pitstop. When he got back out and yellow flags were waved to show that there was to be no overtaking, coming out of the pit lane on lap 20 Schumacher shot across to block Frentzen for turn one. Frentzen steered off the track and onto the grass and spun into the gravel at the end of turn one to retire from the Grand Prix.

Williams team principal, Patrick Head, furious at what had just happened, went to Ferrari team principal Jean Todt to have strong words with him about the racing incident: &quot;We [Williams] will do everything to get him [Schumacher] thrown out of this race and no we will not tolerate it&quot;.

As the restart Fisichella led, ahead of Villeneuve, Michael Schumacher, Damon Hill, Magnussen and Shinji Nakano. Villeneuve immediately tried to go around the outside of Fisichella and take the lead, but he got it all wrong, went off the track and damaged his rear wing. On lap 35, Schumacher was given a 10-second stop-and-go penalty due to the &#x27;incident&#x27; with Frentzen. This momentarily put him behind Hill, but Schumacher overtook him and regained second place on lap 38. Damon Hill had eventually retired on lap 43 with the result of an electrical problem. Then he took the lead on lap 45 when Fisichella went in for his only pit stop. Schumacher then extended his lead over the rest of the pack, and by the time he made his second pit stop to refuel he was able to hold on to his first place, and subsequently finish the race with 16 seconds between himself and second-place finisher Fisichella, with Schumacher&#x27;s team-mate Eddie Irvine in third, well over a minute behind despite picking up a puncture at the restart. Jan Magnussen finished sixth, scoring his only Formula One point in his last Grand Prix.

<text>The 1998 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Magny-Cours on 28 June 1998. It was the eighth race of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race was won by German driver Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari. It was Schumacher&#x27;s third victory of the season. Northern Irish teammate Eddie Irvine finished second, with Finn Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Mercedes, having started from pole position.

==Report==

===Background===
The race was originally dropped due to a dispute over television broadcasting rights in France. Though TF1 had the rights, rival channel France 3 obtained a judgement from a French court to allow all channels to operate on the grounds of the circuit.

Jos Verstappen replaced Jan Magnussen at the Stewart team for the remainder of the season.

===Qualifying===
Mika Häkkinen of McLaren-Mercedes took pole position, beating Michael Schumacher by 0.2 seconds. David Coulthard qualified third, and Eddie Irvine took fourth place. Throughout the qualifying session, Schumacher and Häkkinen exchanged first place, until Häkkinen finally took the pole.

===Race===
At the beginning of the race, Verstappen stalled his Stewart, the race was stopped on lap 1, and a restart was required. At the second start, Häkkinen was overtaken by Michael Schumacher and Irvine. Schumacher then began to pull away, sometimes at one second a lap, with Irvine holding both the McLarens behind him. On lap 20, Häkkinen tried an ambitious move on Irvine. His attempt failed, and he spun into the gravel trap. However, he managed to keep his car going, pitted for fresh tyres, and rejoined in fourth place. Then he regained third place when Coulthard had problems during his pit stop: Coulthard went into the pits, but due to a fuel filling problem, had to do another lap, and then go into the pits again. After the second set of pit stops, Häkkinen was back behind Irvine, and Schumacher was some way in front. On the final lap, on the final corner, Häkkinen made an attempt to overtake Irvine, after Irvine was very slow through the chicane before the final corner. Irvine just held off Häkkinen to take second, but only by a tenth of a second. However, both drivers were 19 seconds behind Schumacher. After Coulthard&#x27;s misfortune in the pitlane, he finished sixth, scoring one world championship point. It was Ferrari&#x27;s first 1–2 in 8 years, the previous being at the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix, with Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell.

<text>The 1998 British Grand Prix(formally the LI RAC British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Silverstone Circuit, England on 12 July 1998. It was the ninth race of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 60-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari car after starting from second position. Mika Häkkinen, who started from pole position, finished second with Eddie Irvine third in the other Ferrari. Schumacher&#x27;s victory was his fourth of the season, and his third consecutive victory having won both the preceding Canadian and French Grand Prix, but was under controversial circumstances: there was dispute whether he had avoided a stop-and-go penalty by entering the pit lane to serve it on the final lap, crossing the finish line in the pit lane to win the race before reaching his pit box, although the penalty, which was actually merely a time penalty, was later rescinded.

== Report ==

=== Qualifying ===
Mika Häkkinen took pole position by nearly half a second from championship rival Michael Schumacher. Jacques Villeneuve took third position whilst Häkkinen&#x27;s team-mate David Coulthard qualified in fourth. Ralf Schumacher and Olivier Panis had their qualifying times deleted as they were not able to get out of their cars quick enough during an FIA safety drill, to practice evacuating the cockpit in case of fire. Ralf Schumacher had spun and stalled his engine early in qualifying and qualified in the spare car, which was set up for his team-mate Damon Hill.

===Race===
Heavy rain fell during the morning prior to the race. Although the rain stopped before the start, there was a mixture of wet and dry parts on the circuit and as a result all but two cars started on intermediate compound tyres. The two Stewart-Fords decided to start on dry weather tyres. The first retirement came after 13 laps, when Damon Hill lost control on the damp track whilst battling with Villeneuve for 7th place. After 16 laps, it began to rain again, and many drivers switched to a full wet weather tyre. Johnny Herbert spun and regained the track, but had damaged his car and retired on reaching the pits.

David Coulthard, driving on intermediates, spun out on lap 38 whilst passing a backmarker. Jarno Trulli spun out on the same lap as Coulthard as Barrichello spun out and hit the wall at Club on lap 40. His McLaren-Mercedes team-mate Mika Häkkinen had built up a lead of 49 seconds over second place driver Michael Schumacher when four laps later he went off the track, did a complete 360 degrees turn before continuing. The incident damaged the front wing of his car and cost him 10 seconds of his lead but following numerous other spins caused by the worsening conditions the safety car was deployed which slowed the cars down, and removed Häkkinen&#x27;s advantage over Schumacher altogether.

The race restarted on lap 50 and it took only two laps for Häkkinen to make another mistake, which put Schumacher in the lead. The German quickly pulled away from his rival, who was now nursing his McLaren home.
However, two laps from the finish, Schumacher was issued with a 10-second time penalty for passing Alexander Wurz under the safety car on lap 43. Unsure whether the handwritten notification declared that Schumacher would see 10 seconds being added to his race time or had to serve a 10-second stop-and-go penalty, his team decided to call in him into the pits out of precaution to serve a stop-and-go penalty at the end of the last lap of the race. However, in doing so Schumacher crossed the finish line in the pit lane before reaching the Ferrari garage resulting in a dispute on whether he had actually served a stop and go penalty.

=== Post-race ===
Following the race a dispute arose surrounding the circumstances of Michael Schumacher being issued with and serving his penalty. His team argued that the penalty should have been issued within 25 minutes of the incident but instead they were informed after 31 minutes. They also argued that the hand-written notification was unclear as to which penalty was actually being issued: a stop-and-go, or a 10-second addition to Schumacher&#x27;s race time, though the FIA&#x27;s International Court of Appeal later clarified that it was the latter. The stewards then decided to nevertheless apply the 10-second addition, post-race. However, the added time penalty can only be used to punish an infraction in the last 12 laps of a Grand Prix, and so did not apply here. The stewards eventually rescinded the penalty altogether.

A protest was lodged by McLaren-Mercedes who felt Ferrari cheated by not having Schumacher serve the penalty, but this was rejected by the FIA. At the hearing for the protest the International Court of Appeal confirmed that the stewards had made several mistakes in issuing a 10-second time penalty for an incident that happened outside of the last 12 laps of a race while exceeding the allowed time limit for the notification of a penalty having been issued. As a result of their mistakes, the three stewards involved handed in their licenses at an extraordinary meeting of the FIA World Council.

<text>The 1998 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the A1-Ring on 26 July 1998. It was the tenth round of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. A wet-dry qualifying session resulted in a mixed-up grid order, with Giancarlo Fisichella taking the first pole position of his career. The 71-lap race was won by Mika Häkkinen for McLaren, with teammate David Coulthard recovering to finish second, having been involved in two collisions during the race, and Michael Schumacher finishing third for Ferrari.

== Report ==
===Qualifying===
The qualifying session led to an unusual grid due to wet conditions, which dried out towards the end, with Fisichella taking his first ever pole and Jean Alesi alongside him in the Sauber.

===Race===
Häkkinen started well to lead into the first corner but several cars collided at the first corner behind them, with Toranosuke Takagi&#x27;s car ending up stranded. Olivier Panis was left immobile on the line with clutch failure. At the second corner, there was another accident, with both Arrows drivers colliding, hitting Coulthard in the process and knocking off his wing after he had qualified in 14th. Coulthard entered the pit lane for a new nose as a safety car was deployed to allow the debris from the collisions to be cleaned up, and he was able to catch up to the back of the field.

At the restart, Häkkinen led away again with Schumacher close behind him. Schumacher attempted to pass Häkkinen but ran wide, allowing Fisichella in the Benetton past him and almost Rubens Barrichello in the Stewart as well. Barrichello soon dropped out with brake problems, while Schumacher overtook Fisichella again. Schumacher was already on a disadvantage with a two-stop strategy and Häkkinen on just one; his situation got worse when he ran very wide, bouncing violently through the gravel trap and ripping off his front wing. He was able to reach the pits and fit a new wing but rejoined almost a lap behind. Around the same time, Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the Williams experienced an engine failure, which caught fire; he was able to escape from the car unharmed.

Twenty-one laps in, Fisichella and Alesi clashed at the second corner, with both having to retire. Coulthard and Schumacher were both quickly moving back up through the field; he had a lot of trouble passing his brother Ralf Schumacher in the Jordan Grand Prix, finally succeeding after several laps. Schumacher then started to catch up to teammate Eddie Irvine, who was slowing; although Irvine said after it was due to marginal brakes, some suggested he was given a team order and asked to move over for his team leader. In the end, Häkkinen took an easy victory. His teammate Coulthard finished second after being last at the start, and Schumacher took third aided by Irvine.

<text>The 1998 German Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland 1998) was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 2 August 1998. It was the eleventh round of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 45-lap race was won by Mika Häkkinen for McLaren from pole position, with teammate David Coulthard finishing second and Jacques Villeneuve finishing third for Williams.

==Qualifying==
Mika Häkkinen took pole position ahead of teammate David Coulthard. Jacques Villeneuve qualified in third, in a new long-wheelbase Williams. Ralf Schumacher was fourth.

Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen&#x27;s main championship rival, qualified ninth after a series of problems throughout practice. Ferrari&#x27;s long-wheelbase chassis, making its Grand Prix debut, was dismissed by Schumacher after he tried it during the Friday practice sessions. Back in his old car, he spun off on his first lap during first practice on Saturday, and then suffered an engine failure early in second practice.

There were also various mutterings that the Ferraris were off the pace as McLaren had threatened to protest about the Italian team&#x27;s new braking system, and some were sure it had been removed to the team&#x27;s obvious detriment.

==Race summary==
Come the race, the McLarens were dominant, running first and second throughout and only stopping once each. Ralf Schumacher, running on a light fuel load due to his two-stop strategy, looked to be the only driver capable of troubling them in the first part of the race. He managed to stay with the McLarens but he could not pass them.

Lap 24 saw Jos Verstappen retire the Stewart-Ford with a gearbox failure, as Rubens Barrichello retired with the same problem 3 laps later. Villeneuve took over third place when Schumacher made the first of his stops, and this was where he stayed to the finish. By the end, Villeneuve was catching the McLarens because Häkkinen had not taken on enough fuel at his stop, and the Finn had to slow down to reduce his fuel consumption.

Damon Hill, who also one stopped came through to take his first points of the year, finishing ahead of Michael and Ralf Schumacher in fifth and sixth places respectively.

<text>The 1998 Hungarian Grand Prix (formally the XIV Marlboro Magyar Nagydíj) was a Formula One motor race held at the Hungaroring, Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary on 16 August 1998. It was the twelfth race of the 1998 Formula One World Championship.

The 77-lap race was won by German driver Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, after he started from third position. Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Finn Mika Häkkinen, took pole position in his McLaren-Mercedes and led the first 46 laps. Under guidance from Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn, Schumacher opted to take three pit stops rather than the two favoured by the McLarens, and took the lead after his second stop, before extending his advantage such that he could retain it after his third stop. Schumacher went on to win by 9.4 seconds from Briton David Coulthard in the other McLaren-Mercedes, with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve third in a Williams-Mecachrome.

With Häkkinen dropping to sixth after shock absorber problems in the closing stages of the race, Schumacher cut the Finn&#x27;s championship lead to seven points with four races remaining. In October 1998, the organisers of the race were fined US$1 million, with US$750,000 of it suspended, due to a track invasion. As there was no repeat of this invasion in the following two years, the fine was US$250,000.

<doc id="1123337" wikidata="Q950107" url="?curid=1123337" title="Frankie Hejduk">
<text>Frank Daniel &quot;Frankie&quot; Hejduk (born August 5, 1974) is an American former soccer player who played as a wingback and midfielder. At the club level he represented the Tampa Bay Mutiny, Bayer Leverkusen, St. Gallen, Columbus Crew, and the LA Galaxy. A full international between 1996 and 2009, he won 85 caps for the United States national team and represented his nation at the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups. He also represented the United States at the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics.

Hejduk serves as the manager of team strategic partnerships within the Crew front office.

==Early life==
Hejduk attended San Dieguito High School where he played on the boys&#x27; soccer team. He was also a member of the powerhouse La Jolla Nomads Soccer Club which won the California state youth championship in 1989, 1990 and 1991. After high school, Hejduk attended UCLA. He spent three seasons, 1992 to 1994, as a defender on the UCLA Bruins soccer team. While a defender, he was the second leading scorer in 1994 with six goals. He was also named an NCAA second-team All-American his junior year.

==Club career==
===MLS===
In February 1996, Tampa Bay Mutiny drafted Hejduk in the seventh round (67th overall) of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. Hejduk played in the league&#x27;s first three seasons. However, commitments to the Olympic team limited him to only eight games as a rookie. In 1997, Hejduk established himself on the Mutiny defense, playing 22 games and registering one goal and six assists. He did much of the same in 1998, registering three goals and one assist with the team over 18 games while missing significant time while playing in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

===Europe===
Hejduk&#x27;s performance in the World Cup inspired German First Division side Bayer Leverkusen to purchase his contract from MLS on July 13, 1998. He remained with the Mutiny through the end of the 1998 season then joined Leverkusen in January 1999. After initially struggling at Leverkusen, Hejduk came on strong at the end of the 1998–99 season when the club experienced several critical injuries. He started ten of the last eleven games, helping the team earn a place in the UEFA Champions League. At the beginning of the 1999–2000 season, Leverkusen manager Christoph Daum changed Leverkusen&#x27;s tactical formation which took Hejduk out of the starting line up. Although Hejduk only appeared in six Bundesliga games for the team in 1999–2000, he played a significant role for the club in their Champions League campaign, appearing in five of Leverkusen&#x27;s six games and twice being named as Man of the Match. Hejduk&#x27;s role at Leverkusen continued to dwindle in 2000–01 as he only appeared in three league games for the team and a single Champions League match, spending most of his time with their third division affiliate. In the 2001–02 season, Hejduk&#x27;s role was even further diminished, as a shoulder injury kept him out of early season action, and he did not receive any playing time following his recovery. It became so bad, that Daum&#x27;s replacement as manager Klaus Toppmöller stated that Hejduk had no future with Leverkusen. Leverkusen eventually sold Hejduk&#x27;s contract to Swiss club FC St. Gallen, during the 2001–02 season. Hejduk then signed for an additional year at Gallen but made only seven appearances with the first team, losing his spot as the season progressed.

===Return to MLS===

Unable to find playing time in Europe, Hejduk returned to the United States and Major League Soccer for the 2003 season, where he was allocated to the Columbus Crew. Hejduk immediately found a spot as team leader right back for the Crew, and went on to start 23 games for the team that season, assisting on four goals. He played a similar role at right back and right midfield in 2004, starting 19 games and scoring two goals for a club that won the MLS Supporters Shield. On January 25, 2007, the Columbus Crew announced that they had signed Hejduk to a two-year contract extension, keeping him with the Crew through the 2008 MLS season. On November 23, 2008, Hejduk headed home a pass from Guillermo Barros Schelotto to provide the final goal in a 3–1 victory securing the Crew&#x27;s first MLS Cup.

After the 2010 MLS season Columbus declined Hejduk&#x27;s contract option and Hejduk elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 15, 2010, Hejduk was selected by Sporting Kansas City in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft, and subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy later the same day. He played six first-team games and another five games with the Galaxy reserve team. At season&#x27;s end, Los Angeles declined his 2012 contract option and Hejduk entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. After no other club selected him, Los Angeles exercised its option to retain his MLS rights. However, on January 30, 2012, the club announced that it was unable to come to terms with Hejduk and that he would not play for the Galaxy in 2012.

Rather than having microfracture surgery on his ankle and additional surgery to repair a broken wrist, Hejduk officially announced his retirement from professional soccer on April 19, 2012, opting to accept a position in the Crew front office.

==International career==
Hejduk was a frequent starter for the U.S. Men&#x27;s National Team, and is the only individual to have represented the U.S. in the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympic Games and the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cup Finals tournaments.

In 1990, Hejduk spent time on the U.S. U-17 national team, but was not selected for 1991 U-17 World Cup. Upon leaving UCLA, Hejduk trained full-time with the U.S. U-23 as it prepared for the upcoming 1996 Summer Olympics. This time, Hejduk made the U.S. Olympic roster, playing all three games as the U.S. went 1–1–1 and failed to make the second round. Following the Olympics, Hejduk joined his professional club and made his debut with the senior U.S. national team.

Hejduk received his first cap for the United States August 30, 1996, against El Salvador. In his first start in December of the same year, he scored a goal against Guatemala in a World Cup Qualifier. Hejduk became a regular on the U.S. team but became known for his lackadaisical &quot;surfer&quot; approach to his game. This attitude persisted until he missed a team flight to China on January 23, 1997, having spent the night with friends and overslept. U.S. coach Steve Sampson dropped Hejduk from the U.S. roster. Over the next year, Hejduk saw precisely six minutes on the field with the U.S., in an August 7, 1997, loss to Ecuador. During that year, he married his longtime girlfriend, Kim Walters, and after considerable thought decided to commit himself to a professional soccer career.

Beginning with a February 1, 1998, victory over Cuba in the 1998 Gold Cup, Hejduk again became a regular with the national team. Since then he has remained a mainstay. Following the Gold Cup, Hejduk was named to the U.S. roster for the World Cup, where he started two of the United States&#x27; three matches. Although Hejduk&#x27;s role with the United States waned during his years with Leverkusen, he seized an opportunity to regain his starting role at the 2002 Gold Cup when he took over the left back position vacated by David Regis. Hejduk held onto it to play an important role for the United States in the 2002 World Cup, starting four games from a left back position. On May 2, 2006, Hejduk was named to his third successive U.S. World Cup roster for the tournament in Germany, but was replaced after suffering a torn ACL.

In 2007, he returned to the USMNT roster after playing for the Crew in the spring, and started his first game for the U.S. in June&#x27;s 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament. In that tourney&#x27;s semifinal vs. Canada (June 21), Frankie made the first goal of the match in a U.S.&#x27;s 2–1 win, a spectacular long shot that earned him the match&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Game&quot; honor from Fox Soccer Channel. He started the first qualifier for the 2010 World Cup held in his home stadium, Columbus Crew Stadium on February 11, 2009, a 2–0 victory against Mexico. After the game, Hejduk was involved in an altercation with Mexican assistant coach Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Javier Ramírez, who slapped Hejduk in the tunnels as both teams headed to the locker room. Hejduk did not retaliate, and Ramirez was not reprimanded nor apologized. On March 28, 2009, Hejduk was influential in both U.S. goals in the final 15 minutes to earn the U.S. a 2–2 draw at El Salvador. His header in the 87th minute earned the U.S. a crucial point.

Frankie Hejduk was not named to the U.S. National Team&#x27;s preliminary 2010 FIFA World Cup roster, when it was released on May 11, 2010.

==Post-playing career==
On April 19, 2012, Hejduk rejoined the Crew organization, agreeing to terms to become the club&#x27;s &quot;Brand Ambassador&quot;, a job focused on community outreach and marketing of the team. As of 2023, Hejduk&#x27;s official position within the Crew&#x27;s Front Office was Manager of Team Strategic Partnerships.

==Personal life==
Frankie&#x27;s Croatian surname, &quot;Hejduk&quot;, is a derivation of the term Hajduk. He has been married to Elissa Zurcher since 2005 and has four children; three sons, Frankie Nesta (born February 25, 1998), Coasten Daniel (born January 2, 2008) and Hendrix (born 2015) and one daughter, Kali (born 2010). His favorite soccer team is Boca Juniors and his favorite player was Claudio Caniggia. He is also a fan of the Los Angeles Chargers. Hejduk is a huge fan of Jamaican reggae legend Bob Marley and celebrates his goals by replicating the hypnotic dances Marley did during his performances.

Hejduk gained some small notoriety in October 2008 after he showed up at a Crew supporters tailgate for a game against the LA Galaxy while serving a one-game suspension. With his duty on the U.S. Soccer team, he became one of first former Yugoslav soccer players to play for the United States, following with Serbian American Preki.

Hejduk is an avid surfer and was a member of San Dieguito High School&#x27;s state and national championship surfing team. He was a 1988 National Junior High School Surfing Champion and qualified for the 1989 U.S. Amateur Surfing Team by finishing tenth overall.

<text>The 1998 Belgian Grand Prix (formally the LVI Foster&#x27;s Belgian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 30 August 1998 at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps; it was the thirteenth race of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. The race was won by Damon Hill driving for the Jordan team, with Hill&#x27;s teammate Ralf Schumacher finishing in second place and Jean Alesi finishing in third for the Sauber team, taking his 32nd and last podium of his Formula One career.

The race ran entirely in extremely wet weather, and David Coulthard lost control of his McLaren at the start on the first lap, causing a multiple collision involving thirteen drivers, which led to the race being stopped. After a delay of more than an hour to clear the track, a second attempt was made to start the race, albeit without four of the drivers involved in the incident. At the restart, championship leader and polesitter Mika Häkkinen spun his McLaren at the first corner and was hit by the Sauber of Johnny Herbert, forcing them both to retire from the race. Hill took the lead but was overtaken on lap eight by Michael Schumacher. Schumacher had built up over 30 seconds of advantage over Hill by lap 24 when he came up to lap Coulthard. After being instructed over the team radio to let him past, Coulthard slowed down but stayed on the main racing line; due to the spray behind Coulthard, Schumacher was unsighted, hit the back of the McLaren, and caused terminal damage to his Ferrari. Coulthard initially retired due to damage on his own car but eventually rejoined the race and finished seventh.

Hill inherited the lead again, with his Jordan teammate behind him. In the latter stages of the race, the younger Schumacher was catching Hill. Initially, the team informed Hill about his teammate&#x27;s pace and implied he should let him past. Hill responded that he would not step down, telling team owner Eddie Jordan they either race for first place and risk ending up with nothing, implying a collision, or hold positions and bring the team a 1–2 finish. As a result, team orders were ultimately issued, requiring both drivers to hold their positions to the finish. Hill brought home the first Formula One win for the Jordan team (the second for Mugen Motorsports engines) after 126 starts, bringing his own win tally to 22. It was also his first win in two years since leaving Williams and would turn out to be his 22nd and final Formula One win, as well as the 42nd and last podium of his career.

==Report==
===Background===
Heading into the 13th round of the season, Mika Häkkinen led the championship with 77 points. Michael Schumacher was in second place, seven points behind. Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard was in third position on 48 points, making these three the only drivers who could mathematically win the title. With a maximum of 40 points available for the remaining four races, Eddie Irvine in fourth place could not catch Häkkinen&#x27;s score, as he was 45 points behind. In the constructors championship, McLaren led on 125 points, ahead of Ferrari on 102. Benetton were in third position with 32 points, which meant they could not catch McLaren or Ferrari with a maximum of 64 points available from the remaining races. Williams in fourth position were two points behind Benetton and Jordan were a further four points behind in fifth.

All the teams, with the exception of Tyrrell, had carried out testing in the time since the previous race in Hungary. McLaren opted to run at both Monza in Italy and Silverstone in the United Kingdom. Also present at Silverstone were the Williams, Arrows, and Stewart teams, with Williams test driver Juan Pablo Montoya setting the fastest time of those present at the circuit. Ferrari opted to run at both Monza and their own Fiorano Circuit in Maranello, Italy. Jordan were also present at Monza, although it was Coulthard for McLaren who set the fastest time at this circuit. Sauber and Minardi opted to join Ferrari at Fiorano, whilst the Benetton and Prost teams travelled to Magny-Cours, France, and Barcelona, Spain, respectively, to conduct private testing.

===Practice and qualifying===
Three practice sessions were held before the race; two on Friday and a third on Saturday morning. All three sessions were scheduled to run for one hour. David Coulthard was fastest in the first session, ahead of teammate Mika Häkkinen who finished second despite a crash late in the session. The Ferrari and Williams cars occupied the remaining top six positions; Ferrari drivers Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine third and fifth, respectively. The Williams were fourth and sixth fastest, with Jacques Villeneuve ahead of Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Schumacher lapped fastest in the second practice session, with the two McLarens second (Häkkinen) and third (Coulthard). Damon Hill driving for Jordan placed fourth. Villeneuve was involved in an incident when he lost control of his car at 290 km/h whilst negotiating the Eau Rouge corner. The session was halted for 25 minutes whilst his car was recovered. Although Villeneuve was taken to the medical centre at the circuit, he was not injured. It was described as his &quot;biggest crash in F1 so far&quot;. 

In the third practice session held on the Saturday, McLaren were again the fastest cars with Häkkinen and Coulthard finishing the session with the first and second fastest times, respectively. Hill finished the session third, whilst Villeneuve finished in fourth place driving what was originally designated the Williams spare car after the damage caused to his original car on Friday. The Ferraris of Schumacher and Irvine were fifth and sixth, respectively. During the session, Mika Salo crashed heavily at Eau Rouge, and was taken to hospital as a precaution but was cleared to take part in qualifying. The qualifying session took the form of a one-hour session held on Saturday afternoon. with each driver permitted to complete up to twelve laps. Häkkinen clinched his ninth pole position of the 1998 season with a time of 1:48.682. McLaren teammate Coulthard joined him on the front row, with a best time just under two-tenths of second slower than that of Häkkinen, the two drivers both having held the fastest lap at different points throughout the session. Hill qualified in third position, his highest of the season, with a time that was over a second slower than that of Häkkinen but three tenths faster than Schumacher. Schumacher, Häkkinen&#x27;s main rival for the championship, qualified in fourth position despite having his fastest laptime deleted, as the stewards decided he failed to slow down sufficiently when passing a yellow flag, which indicates a hazard on the track. In the event, it did not affect his position, as his fastest laptime would still have only been good enough for fourth position. Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari teammate Irvine finished the session fifth fastest and Villeneuve was sixth.

===Race===
Race day was very wet and Michael Schumacher was fastest in the morning warm-up session. Despite the heavy, moonsoon-like rain, it was decided that the race would start at the scheduled time without a safety car, unlike the previous season&#x27;s race. At the start, Mika Häkkinen led from a fast-starting Jacques Villeneuve, Schumacher, and Giancarlo Fisichella. Behind them, David Coulthard suddenly emerged from the opaque spray at a right angle to the racing line and hit the trackside wall. At the time, Coulthard claimed he had made contact with Eddie Irvine but has since said &quot;the reality is I just dropped a wheel onto the metal grille&quot;. The McLaren rebounded directly into the path of the oncoming field, causing a chain reaction that took out eleven drivers, which was almost the entire race field, as it took out more than half the field; this became one of the most famous or infamous Formula One incidents and moments, and came to be labelled &quot;The Great Pileup&quot;. Some drivers, including the Jordans of Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher and Esteban Tuero of Minardi, managed to get through unscathed. Hill was just a few metres ahead of the carnage while his teammate was behind. Drivers involved in the crash along with Coulthard included Eddie Irvine (Ferrari), Alexander Wurz (Benetton), Rubens Barrichello (Stewart), Johnny Herbert (Sauber), Olivier Panis (Prost), Jarno Trulli (Prost), Mika Salo (Arrows), Pedro Diniz (Arrows), Toranosuke Takagi (Tyrrell), Ricardo Rosset (Tyrrell) and Shinji Nakano (Minardi). Jos Verstappen managed to get his Stewart back to the pits but it was too badly damaged to continue. The race was stopped before the end of the first lap in order to allow the damaged cars to be recovered and the track to be cleared.

The race start&#x27;s pile up was the biggest first lap incident since the 1973 British Grand Prix caused eleven cars to retire. No one was injured, and all those involved in the incident were eligible to take place in the second start, as the regulations in force at the time stated that should any race be stopped within the first two laps, the start would be null and void, and a full restart over the original distance would take place. Both Irvine and Barrichello had sustained minor injuries; while Irvine restarted, Barrichello did not. Three teams had both of their cars damaged, each only had one spare car available, which meant that Salo, Rosset, and Panis could not restart as their teams decided to provide the spare car to their teammates. In total, four drivers did not take the second start. The second attempt to start the race took place nearly an hour after the first. At the start, Hill took the lead of a Grand Prix for the first time since the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix. Championship leaders Häkkinen and Schumacher battled for position at the first corner, where Häkkinen lost control of his car, and was hit by Herbert&#x27;s Sauber, forcing both Häkkinen and Herbert to retire from the race. Also during the first lap, Coulthard and Alexander Wurz collided, the damage resulted in Wurz being out of the race while Coulthard rejoined in last position. The safety car was deployed to slow the competitors down and allow Häkkinen&#x27;s car, which was stranded in the middle of the track, to be safely recovered. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of the second lap, with Hill continuing to lead from Schumacher after the resumption of the race. Hill retained the lead until the eighth lap, when Schumacher overtook him at the Bus Stop. Irvine then lost his front wing in an off-track excursion, dropping him from third to eleventh place as he pitted for repairs.

As the race intensified, Villeneuve spun out having briefly taken the lead during the first round of pitstops. Schumacher retained his lead and was nearly 40 seconds ahead of Hill when he came up to lap Coulthard. Jean Todt had already paid a visit to the McLaren pitwall to ensure that Coulthard would move over. In the other race-defining moment, Coulthard did not let Schumacher by immediately, causing the Ferrari driver to shake his fist at the Scot. As the cars came down the hill towards Pouhon, Coulthard attempted to let Schumacher through by lifting off to reduce his speed. Crucially, he had not moved off the racing line, and in very poor visibility, obscured by the spray, Schumacher slammed straight into the back of the McLaren, tearing off the right-front wheel of the Ferrari and removing the rear wing of the McLaren. Both cars made it back to the pits; Schumacher immediately got out of his car and made his way to the McLaren garage. Convinced that Coulthard was at fault, Schumacher confronted him. According to Coulthard&#x27;s version of events, Schumacher accused Coulthard of &quot;trying to fucking kill me&quot;, and also threatened to kill Coulthard. Many were convinced that Coulthard did it intentionally in order to help his teammate.
After Ferrari and McLaren team personnel separated the two drivers, Schumacher then went to the stewards&#x27; office to protest. As the race continued, the stewards considered Schumacher&#x27;s protest. At the time, they found no case against Coulthard, and the stewards further requested an explanation for why the German had driven into Coulthard&#x27;s spray in the first place after Coulthard had moved aside to let him through. Coulthard later rejoined the race after his rear wing was replaced. As a result of Schumacher&#x27;s retirement, Hill had taken the lead of the Grand Prix ahead of his teammate. On the same lap, Irvine spun out of the race, ending Ferrari&#x27;s interest in the race. One lap later, Fisichella&#x27;s Benetton hit the back of Nakano&#x27;s Minardi, ripping both the front wheels from the Benetton and damaging the back of the Minardi. The Benetton brushed against the end of the pitwall and caught fire as it came to a stop, which was quickly extinguished. Both drivers were unharmed but the incident resulted in the safety car again being deployed, and Hill immediately made his second pitstop to take advantage, retaining his lead. At this stage of the race, only six cars were running, meaning every car was in a position to score world championship points. This led to both Coulthard and Nakano rejoining the race after lengthy repairs to their cars in a bid to get a world championship point should there be any further retirements.

As the race resumed, Hill led his teammate, with Jean Alesi close behind in third. It was then just a matter of counting down the laps to the finish for the Jordan team and it was Hill who took his 22nd and final Grand Prix victory, handing Jordan their first ever Grand Prix victory at the circuit where they gained their first pole position in 1994 and finished second in 1997. It later emerged that team orders had been issued preventing the younger Schumacher from overtaking Hill. The race has been variously described as controversial, the season&#x27;s &quot;best bit&quot;, &quot;undoubtedly the most incident packed, exciting and historic race since the 1997 title-decider at Jerez&quot;, and &quot;one of Formula 1&#x27;s greatest-ever wet races&quot;, and it has been called &quot;one of the most dramatic races ever&quot;, as well as &quot;one of the most remarkable F1 races ever&quot;.

===Post-race===
During the podium ceremony, there was confusion when &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the British national anthem, was played for winning constructor Jordan instead of &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot;, the Irish national anthem. Although Jordan was based in the United Kingdom, its Formula One team&#x27;s nationality reflected its Irish ownership as well as its racing licence which was issued by the Irish national racing authority. When Heinz-Harald Frentzen recorded Jordan&#x27;s second win at the 1999 French Grand Prix, the Irish anthem was played.

Following the revelation that Eddie Jordan had ordered Ralf Schumacher not to overtake Damon Hill, amid the post-race celebrations his brother Michael Schumacher angrily confronted Jordan in his motorhome, telling him that his brother would not race for his team again and bought out his contract for £2 million. In the next season, the younger Schumacher moved to Williams.

One week after the race, Schumacher and Coulthard had a one and a half-hour private meeting and emerged shaking hands vowing to join up to combat for clearer guidelines when lapping and overtaking. Schumacher later said: &quot;It&#x27;s clear he [Coulthard] did nothing wrong at Spa.&quot; In 2003, Coulthard admitted for the first time the crash at Spa was his fault. He said: &quot;The reality is that I lifted to let him pass me, but I lifted in heavy spray on the racing line. You should never do that. I would never do that now.&quot; Schumacher thanked Coulthard for agreeing with him about the incident, and commented: &quot;I&#x27;m glad he finally shares the same opinion as me on this incident. It happened a long time ago and there is nothing more to say about it. But it&#x27;s nice to hear him admit it.&quot;

;Notes
* – Barrichello, Panis, Salo, and Rosset are all listed as &quot;Did Not Start&quot; (DNS) in the official results despite having taken the first start prior to the race being stopped. Regulations at the time were such that, in the event of a stoppage being ordered on the first lap, the original start would be deemed null and void, and the second start would take place as if the first had never occurred. As these four drivers did not make the second start, they are classified as DNS.

<doc id="1123339" wikidata="Q327223" url="?curid=1123339" title="Freestyle wrestling">
<text>Freestyle wrestling is a style of wrestling. It is one of two styles of wrestling contested in the Olympic Games, along with Greco-Roman. High school wrestling and men&#x27;s collegiate wrestling in the United States are conducted under different rules and termed scholastic and collegiate wrestling. U.S. collegiate women&#x27;s wrestling is conducted under freestyle rules.
Freestyle wrestling, like collegiate wrestling, has its origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling. In both styles, the ultimate goal is to throw and pin the opponent to the mat, which results in an immediate win. Unlike Greco-Roman, freestyle and collegiate wrestling allow the use of the wrestler&#x27;s or the opponent&#x27;s legs in offense and defense.

According to wrestling&#x27;s world governing body, the United World Wrestling (UWW), freestyle wrestling is one of the six main forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced around the globe today. The other five forms are as follows:

# Greco-Roman wrestling
# Grappling/submission wrestling
# Beach wrestling
# Pankration athlima
# Alysh/belt wrestling
# Traditional/folk wrestling.

In 2013, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended dropping wrestling as a sport from the 2020 Olympic Games, but the decision was later reversed by the IOC.

==History==

Modern freestyle wrestling, according to UWW (formerly FILA), has been said to have originated in Great Britain and the United States by the name of &quot;catch-as-catch-can&quot; wrestling. &quot;Catch-as-catch-can&quot; wrestling had a particular following in Great Britain and the variant developed in Lancashire had a particular effect on freestyle wrestling. &quot;Catch-as-catch-can&quot; wrestling gained great popularity in fairs and festivals during the 19th century. In catch-as-catch-can wrestling, both contestants started out standing and then a wrestler sought to hold his opponent&#x27;s shoulder to the ground (known as a fall). If no fall was scored, both wrestlers continued grappling on the ground, and almost all holds and techniques were allowable. A Scottish variant of Lancashire wrestling also became popular, which began with both wrestlers standing chest to chest, grasping each other with locked arms around the body and, if no fall was made, with the match continuing on the ground. In addition, there was the Irish collar-and-elbow style, where wrestlers started out on their feet with both wrestlers grasping each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. If neither wrestler then achieved a fall, the contestants would continue both standing and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish immigrants later brought this style of wrestling to the United States, where it soon became widespread, especially because of the success of the wrestling champion of the Army of the Potomac, George William Flagg from Vermont. Catch-as-catch can was the style performed by at least a half dozen U.S. presidents, including George Washington, Zachary Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt.

Because of the widespread interest in and esteem of professional Greco-Roman wrestling and its popularity in many international meets in nineteenth century Europe, freestyle wrestling (and wrestling as an amateur sport in general) had a tough time gaining ground on the continent. The 1896 Olympic Games had only one wrestling bout, a heavyweight Greco-Roman match. Freestyle wrestling first emerged as an Olympic sport in the St. Louis Olympics of 1904. All 40 wrestlers who participated in the 1904 Olympics were American. The 1904 Olympics sanctioned the rules commonly used for catch-as-catch-can, but imposed some restrictions on dangerous holds. Wrestling by seven weight classes—47.6 kg (104.9 lb), 52.2 kg (115.1 lb), 56.7 kg (125.0 lb), 61.2 kg (134.9 lb), 65.3 kg (143.9 lb), 71.7 kg (156.7 lb), and greater than —was an important innovation in the Summer Olympics.

Since 1921, the body now known as United World Wrestling (UWW), which has its headquarters near Lausanne, Switzerland, has set the &quot;Rules of the Game&quot;, with regulations for scoring and procedures that govern tournaments such as the World Games and the competition at the Summer Olympics. These were later adopted by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) for its freestyle matches. Freestyle wrestling gained great popularity in the United States after the Civil War. By the 1880s, tournaments drew hundreds of wrestlers. The rise of cities, increased industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the affable environment for amateur wrestling, along with boxing, to increase in esteem and popularity. Amateur wrestling teams soon emerged, such as the wrestling team of the New York Athletic Club, which had its first tournament in 1878. Professional wrestling also developed, and by the 1870s, professional championship matches offered allowances of up to $1,000.

Nineteenth century wrestling matches were particularly long, and especially Greco-Roman bouts (where holds below the waist and the use of the legs are not allowed) could last as many as eight to nine hours, and even then, it was only decided by a draw. In the 20th century, time limits were set for matches. For more than forty years into the twentieth century, freestyle and its USA counterpart, collegiate wrestling, did not have a scoring system that decided matches in the absence of a fall. The introduction of a point system by Oklahoma State University wrestling coach Art Griffith gained acceptance in 1941 and influenced the international styles as well. By the 1960s international wrestling matches in Greco-Roman and freestyle were scored by a panel of three judges in secret, who made the final decision by raising colored paddles at the match&#x27;s end. Dr. Albert de Ferrari from San Francisco who became vice president of FILA (now UWW), lobbied for a visible scoring system and a rule for &quot;controlled fall&quot;, which would recognize a fall only when the offensive wrestler had done something to cause it. These were soon adopted internationally in Greco-Roman and freestyle. By 1996, before a major overhaul of FILA rules, an international freestyle match consisted of two three-minute periods, with a one-minute rest between periods. Today, wrestlers from post-Soviet states, Iran, the United States, Bulgaria, Cuba, Turkey, and Japan have had the strongest showings. Alexander Medved of Belarus won 10 world championships and three Olympic gold medals from 1964 to 1972. Many collegiate wrestlers have moved on to freestyle competition, particularly internationally with great success.

In the spring of 2013, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted wrestling out of the core sports for the summer Olympics beginning in 2020 As a result of this news the wrestling community started a massive campaign in order to reinstate the sport. A largely online group called 2020 vision lead the movement. They had several campaigns as well as Facebook and Twitter pages that spread awareness and gathered support for the cause of wrestling&#x27;s return to the Olympics. They had a mission of gaining 2,000,020 signatures (online and offline) in support of wrestling&#x27;s return to the Olympic Games. In September 2013 the IOC voted to allow wrestling back into the Olympics for 2020 and 2024 as a probationary sport. In order to achieve this, UWW made several changes to the rules as well as changes to the weight classes. There are also discussions about uniform changes as well as changes to the competition mat.

==Weight classes==

Currently, international men&#x27;s freestyle wrestling is divided into six main age categories: schoolboys, cadets, novice, juvenile, juniors, and seniors. Schoolboys (boys ages 14–15; or age 13 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Cadets (young boys ages 16–17; or age 15 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Juniors (young men ages 18 to 20; or age 17 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in eight weight classes ranging from . Seniors (men ages 20 and up) wrestle in seven weight classes ranging from . For men, there is also a special category for some freestyle competitions, &quot;Veterans&quot;, for men ages 35 and older, presumably featuring the same weight classes as seniors. Also, all of the men&#x27;s age categories and weight classes can be applied to Greco-Roman wrestling.

Women currently compete in freestyle wrestling in one of four age categories on an international level: schoolgirls, cadets, juniors, and seniors. Schoolgirls (young women ages 14–15; or age 13 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Cadets (young women ages 16–17; or age 15 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 weight classes ranging from . Juniors (young women ages 18 to 20; or age 17 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in eight weight classes ranging from . Seniors (women ages 20 and up) wrestle in seven weight classes ranging from . Wrestlers after weigh-in may only wrestle in their own weight class. Wrestlers in the senior age category may wrestle up a weight class except for the heavyweight division (which starts at a weight more than for the men and more than for the women). Different nations may have different weight classes and different age categories for their levels of freestyle competition.

==Layout of the mat==
The match takes place on a thick rubber mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a border of the same thickness known as the protection area. Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter (3 ft 3 in) in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the red zone. The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the passivity zone. Inside the red zone is the central wrestling area which is seven meters in diameter. In the middle of the central surface of wrestling is the central circlewhich is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters (4 in) wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters (3  in) in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers&#x27; colors, red and blue or in some areas, red and green.

For competition in the Olympic Games, the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters (6 ft 6 in), the sides of the podium are covered with 45° (degree) inclined panels. In all cases, the color of the protection area is different from the color of the mat.

==Equipment==

* A singlet is a one-piece wrestling garment made of spandex that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from nylon or lycra and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. One wrestler usually competes in a red singlet and the other in a blue singlet.
* A special pair of shoes is worn by the wrestler to increase their mobility and flexibility. Wrestling shoes are light and flexible in order to provide maximum comfort and movement. Usually made with rubber soles, they help give the wrestler&#x27;s feet a better grip on the mat.
* A handkerchief, also called a bloodrag, is carried in the singlet. In the event of bleeding, the wrestler will remove the cloth from his singlet and attempt to stop the bleeding or clean up any bodily fluids that may have gotten onto the mat.
* Headgear, equipment worn around the ears to protect the wrestler, is optional in freestyle. Headgear is omitted at the participant&#x27;s own risk, as there is the potential to develop cauliflower ear.

==The match==
A match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. In freestyle wrestling, a jury (or team) of three officials (referees) is used. The referee controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The judge sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The mat chairman sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman).

===Session format===
In Greco-Roman and freestyle, the format is two three-minute sessions. Before each match, each wrestler&#x27;s name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls both of them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the session.

A wrestler wins the match when he has outscored his opponent at the end of the two three-minute sessions. For example, if one competitor were to score four points in the first session and his opponent two, and then two in the second session, his opponent zero, the competitor would win. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in session termination.

In freestyle, if no wrestler scores in two minutes, the referee of the match will then identify the more passive wrestler, and that wrestler will be given a thirty-second window of opportunity to score, and if he doesn&#x27;t, then his opponent will be awarded a point.

When the session (or match) has concluded, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials&#x27; table. Both wrestlers then approach each other, shake hands, and stand on either side of the referee to await the decision. The referee then proclaims the winner by raising the winner&#x27;s hand. At the end of the match, each wrestler then shakes hands with the referee and returns to shake hands with his opponent&#x27;s coach.

===Match scoring===

In freestyle wrestling, as well as in Greco-Roman wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of explosive action and risk. For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:
* Takedown (2 to 5 points): A wrestler is awarded points for a takedown when the wrestler gains control over his opponent on the mat from a neutral position (when the wrestler is on his feet). At least three points of contact have to be controlled on the mat (e.g. two arms and one knee; two knees and one arm or the head; or two arms and the head). 
::(5 points): 5 points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler brings his opponent off of the mat and controls him so that his feet go directly above his head) either from the standing or &quot;par terre&quot; position into a direct and immediate danger position.
::(4 points): 4 points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude as in the 5-point throw, but does not put the opponent into a direct and immediate danger position or if the opposing wrestler maintains contact with at least one hand on the mat.
::(3 points): Generally, three points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a short amplitude throw that does not bring his opponent in a direct and immediate danger position or for a takedown in which a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is taken from his feet or his stomach to his back or side (a throw of short amplitude) so that he is in the danger position.
::(2 points): Two points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a wrestler taking his opponent from his feet to his stomach or side such that his back or shoulders are not exposed to the mat and while in this position holding him down with control.
* Reversal (1 point): A wrestler is awarded one point for a reversal when the wrestler gains control over his opponent from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by his opponent).
* Exposure, also called the Danger Position (2 or 3 points): A wrestler is awarded points for exposure when the wrestler exposes his opponent&#x27;s back to the mat for several seconds. Points for exposure are also awarded if one&#x27;s back is to the mat but the wrestler is not pinned. Criteria for exposure or the danger position is met when 1) a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is in a bridge position to avoid being pinned, 2) a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is on one or both elbows with his back to the mat and avoids getting pinned, 3) a wrestler holds one of his opponent&#x27;s shoulders to the mat and the other shoulder at an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), 4) a wrestler&#x27;s opponent is in an &quot;instantaneous fall&quot; position (where both of his shoulders are on the mat for less than one second), or 5) the wrestler&#x27;s opponent rolls on his shoulders. A wrestler in the danger position allows his opponent to score two points. An additional hold-down point may be earned by maintaining the exposure continuously for five seconds.
* Penalty (1 or 2 points): Under the 2004-2005 changes to the international styles, a wrestler whose opponent takes an injury time-out receives one point unless the injured wrestler is bleeding. Other infractions (e.g. fleeing a hold or the mat, striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, using illegal holds, etc.) are penalized by an award of either one or two points, a Caution, and a choice of position to the opponent. A wrestler whose opponent regularly refuses to take an ordered hold is awarded a point. Three cautions automatically result in the match being awarded to the opponent.
* Out-of-Bounds (1 point): Whenever a wrestler places his foot in the protection area, the match is stopped, and one point is awarded to his opponent.
* Passivity (1 point): A point awarded to the attacking wrestler whose opponent flees the hold or refuses to start.

Classification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained. For example, a victory by fall would give the winner five classification points and the loser no points, while a match won by technical superiority with the loser scoring technical points would award three points to the winner and one point to loser.

The full determinations for scoring are found https://unitedworldwrestling.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/wrestling_rules.pdf in the &quot;UWW International Wrestling Rules&quot;].

==Victory conditions==
A match can be won in the following ways:
* Win by Fall: The object of the entire wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the fall. A fall, also known as a pin, occurs when one wrestler holds both of his opponents&#x27; shoulders on the mat simultaneously. In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to &quot;observe the total control of the fall&quot; (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made. (If the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall.) A fall ends the match entirely regardless of when it occurs.
* Win by Technical Superiority (Also called Technical Fall): If at any point during the match, a wrestler gains a ten-point lead over his opponent, the wrestler would win the match by technical fall.
* Win by Decision: If neither wrestler achieves either a fall or technical superiority, the wrestler who scored more points during match is declared the winner.
* Win by Default: If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason or fails to show up on the mat after his name was called three times before the match begins, his opponent is declared the winner of the match by default, forfeit, or withdrawal.
* Win by Injury: If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a medical forfeit or injury default. The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. If a wrestler is injured by his opponent&#x27;s illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified.
* Win by Disqualification: Normally, if a wrestler is assessed three Cautions for breaking the rules, he is disqualified. Under other circumstances, such as flagrant brutality, the match may be ended immediately and the wrestler disqualified and removed from the tournament.

===Team scoring in tournaments===
In an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60 kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team&#x27;s score is tallied, and the team with the most points wins the team competition.

===Team competition===
A team competition or dual meet is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the &quot;home&quot; competition and one winning the &quot;away&quot; competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the fewest technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament.

==Women&#x27;s freestyle wrestling==

Women compete in freestyle wrestling at the collegiate, world, and Olympic levels. Women&#x27;s freestyle wrestling made its Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics. There are ten weight classes for women (50 kg, 53 kg, 55 kg, 57 kg, 59 kg, 62 kg, 65 kg, 68 kg, 72 kg and 76 kg) that compete in World Championships. However, after the 2020 Olympic Games, there are only six weight classes (50 kg, 53 kg, 57 kg, 62 kg, 68 kg and 76 kg). Only one representative from each weight class is permitted to compete in the Olympics.

Freestyle wrestling was added to the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program effective with the 2020–21 school year. At that time, 35 NCAA members sponsored women&#x27;s wrestling teams.

Wrestlers wear a red or blue singlet, depending on their bracket placement; all female competitors are required to wear a women&#x27;s-cut singlet.

<text>The 1998 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 13 September 1998. The race was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Eddie Irvine finished second in the other Ferrari and his brother Ralf finished third in a Jordan-Mugen-Honda. , this was the last win for tyre manufacturer Goodyear in Formula One.

==Background==
In August 1998, the organisation of the sporting event was characterised by complications linked to the seizure of several stands and some underpasses by the magistrate&#x27;s court due to alleged irregularities in the testing certifications. The affair continued until the beginning of September, when the use of the stands for the match was allowed. The event was organised by the Automobile Club of Milan and SIAS, the company in charge of managing the racetrack. For the occasion, new giant screens were installed and the car parks and camping areas were expanded.

Heading into the 14th round of the season, Mika Häkkinen led the championship with 77 points. Michael Schumacher was in second place, seven points behind. Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard was in third position on 48 points, making these three the only drivers who could mathematically win the title. In the constructors championship, McLaren led on 125 points, ahead of Ferrari on 102. Williams were third with 33 points, one point ahead of Benetton and seven points ahead of Jordan in fifth. Jordan had just achieved a 1–2 finish at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, where neither Häkkinen nor Schumacher scored any point; when lapping Coulthard, Schumacher had crashed into the Scot&#x27;s McLaren, which had not moved off the racing line, obscured by spray. Although he received no penalty or sanction, many were convinced that Coulthard had intentionally caused the collision with Schumacher in order to help his teammate.

==Report==
===Qualifying===
While the free practice on Friday was dry, by the afternoon session it had rained. In a wet qualifying session, Michael Schumacher took pole position ahead of Jacques Villeneuve, who had achieved the team&#x27;s best qualifying start. Mika Häkkinen, David Coulthard, and Eddie Irvine followed them in third, fourth, and fifth position.

===Race===
Mika Häkkinen made a blinding start from third on the grid, pushing his way past Jacques Villeneuve and Michael Schumacher on the front row; at the same time, it was a dreadful start for Schumacher, who fell down to fifth but then passed Villeneuve for fourth and then Eddie Irvine for third. Häkkinen was struggling with a developing brake issue soon after and he waved his teammate David Coulthard through. Soon after, Coulthard&#x27;s engine blew and seconds later Schumacher, who had caught Häkkinen, passed the Finn when Häkkinen had adjusted his brake bias forwards to cope with the brake problem and ran wide due to the smoke from Coulthard&#x27;s engine.

Villeneuve, who was running very low downforce, soon spun out of the race, and Häkkinen started catching Schumacher again. Häkkinen was just three seconds behind with a handful of laps remaining when his rear brakes failed, sending him into a wild spin at the Roggia chicane. Although he was able to keep his engine running and kept going, at the beginning of the next lap he went off again at the first Rettifilo chicane, and Irvine reeled him in and took second off him. Ralf Schumacher then caught and overtook Häkkinen, who was able to limp home in fourth.

It was a jubilant scene for the Italian crowd as Schumacher came home first and Irvine, his Ferrari teammate, took second, with the younger Schumacher third. It was Jordan&#x27;s third podium finishes in two races. Johnny Herbert retired in unusual circumstances; prior to the start, a Sauber mechanic accidentally left a spanner in the cockpit. During the race, the spanner became jammed under the foot pedals, which caused Herbert to crash. Schumacher was now level on points with Häkkinen going into the Nürburgring, the penultimate round, although Häkkinen still led the championship on countback as both drivers had six wins but Häkkinen had two second places against Schumacher&#x27;s one. This race was Ferrari&#x27;s 600th start in a World Championship event as a team.

<text>The 1998 Luxembourg Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Warsteiner Preis von Luxemburg 1998) was a Formula One motor race held at the Nürburgring, Nürburg, Germany on 27 September 1998. It was the fifteenth and penultimate race of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 67-lap race was won by Mika Häkkinen driving for the McLaren team. Michael Schumacher finished second driving a Ferrari car, with David Coulthard third in the other McLaren.

==Report==
With two races remaining of the season, McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen and Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher were battling for the drivers title; they were level on 80 points with Häkkinen ahead on countback. However the momentum was with Schumacher who had won the previous race at Monza, whereas Häkkinen had not won a race since the German Grand Prix four races earlier.

Ferrari locked out the front row with Schumacher on pole ahead of Eddie Irvine. Häkkinen qualified third. At the start Irvine passed Schumacher to take the lead, however he allowed his team leader past at the end of the first lap and then proceeded to hold up Häkkinen. The Finn passed the Ulsterman at the Veedol Chicane on lap 14 and began to close on Schumacher. The German pitted on lap 24, while Häkkinen stayed out until lap 28, emerging from his stop ahead of Schumacher albeit by less than a second. Häkkinen resisted pressure from Schumacher during the second stint and narrowly held on to his lead during the second round of pit stops. In the final stint Häkkinen pulled away from Schumacher, extending his lead to five seconds before easing off in the closing laps to take victory by 2.2 seconds from Schumacher, with the other McLaren of David Coulthard completing the podium having leapfrogged Irvine during the first round of pitstops. The win gave Häkkinen a four-point lead in the championship heading into the final race in Suzuka, meaning he would only need second place there to clinch his first title.

<text>The 1998 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Suzuka, Mie, Japan on 1 November 1998. It was the sixteenth and final round of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 51-lap race was won by Mika Häkkinen driving for the McLaren-Mercedes team. Eddie Irvine, driving for Ferrari, finished second with David Coulthard third in the other McLaren. Häkkinen&#x27;s win confirmed him as 1998 Drivers&#x27; Champion as title-rival Michael Schumacher retired with a punctured tyre on Lap 31.

Schumacher started on pole position but stalled on the formation lap, meaning he was forced to start at the back of the grid. Schumacher managed to climb the field during the course of the race and eventually retired from a punctured tyre sustained from running over debris from an incident that occurred previously. This was the last race for the Tyrrell racing team, as the team was rebranded into British American Racing the next season.

==Report==

===Background===

Heading into the final race of the season, McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 90 points; Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was second with 86 points. A maximum of 10 points were available for the remaining race, which meant that Schumacher could still win the title. Häkkinen only needed a second-place finish to become Drivers&#x27; Champion even if Schumacher won—both drivers would be tied on points and number of victories but Häkkinen would claim the title as he would have finished second place three times, compared to Schumacher&#x27;s two. Behind Häkkinen and Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, David Coulthard was third on 52 points in a McLaren, with Eddie Irvine fourth on 41 points in a Ferrari. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren were leading with 142 points and Ferrari were second with 127 points, with a maximum of 16 points available, meaning Ferrari needed a 1–2 finish with both McLaren finishing outside point-scoring positions to claim the championship (if the two teams were level on points, McLaren would have won on countback due to having more wins than Ferrari).

During the four-week break that followed the , Ferrari and McLaren performed private tests that were heavily scheduled. Ferrari concentrated their testing at their private race track at Mugello, while McLaren tested at the Circuit de Catalunya where they were joined by Benetton and Prost, Arrows, and Stewart; new entrants for 1999 BAR and Jordan opted to run at Silverstone. Because of two controversial incidents that decided the 1994 and 1997 World Championships, Schumacher was placed under strict orders from Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo not to repeat such incidents. After having been involved since their debut in , tyre supplier Goodyear bowed out of Formula One, having been the sport&#x27;s single tyre supplier for several seasons. Competing manufacturer Bridgestone became the sport&#x27;s single tyre supplier for the season.
===Practice and qualifying===
Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday that was split into two parts and the second on Saturday morning. The first session was held for a total of three hours with the second session lasting two hours. Schumacher set the fastest time in the first practice session with a time of 1:39.823, two-tenths of a second from Jordan driver and brother Ralf Schumacher and Williams driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Schumacher&#x27;s team-mate Irvine was fourth fastest, Häkkinen was fifth fastest with team-mate Coulthard rounding out the top six.

The qualifying session was run as a one-hour session held on Saturday afternoon. Schumacher clinched his third consecutive pole position in his Ferrari, with a time of 1:36.293. He was joined on the front row by Häkkinen, who was one-tenth of a second behind, after not being able to finish his last flying lap by running off in the gravel at the Degner corner. Coulthard was third in the other McLaren. Irvine took fourth in the second Ferrari, with Frentzen taking fifth despite going off into the gravel late in the session.

===Race===

The start of the race was aborted with the Prost car of Jarno Trulli stalling from 14th position. Before the second attempt to start the race, Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari moved forward from his starting position and stalled as he put his car into gear. This promoted Häkkinen into pole position as Schumacher started from the back of the grid.

At the start, Häkkinen pulled away while Irvine overtook Coulthard for second. The Ferrari driver was unable to attack the leading Finn, while Schumacher moved up the order, reaching twelfth place at the end of the first lap. The first retirement was Pedro Diniz, who spun out on lap 3 in the Arrows. By lap four, Schumacher overtook his brother Ralf for seventh but was then stuck behind the fighting former world champions Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve. Meanwhile, Ralf Schumacher would eventually retire with engine failure by the end of lap 14. He lost thirty seconds in the following laps over race leader Häkkinen, damaging his hopes for victory and the title. After all frontrunners had pitted, Schumacher emerged in third place, having put in some fast laps. On lap 28, Esteban Tuero missed his braking point going into the final corner, crashing into the Tyrrell of Tora Takagi. When Schumacher passed over the debris, he suffered a slow puncture that blew up his right rear tyre three laps later, causing him to retire, an event not shown to UK viewers on ITV due to a poorly timed adbreak, forcing Murray Walker to inform viewers upon the return to the broadcast “And you are now looking at the new World Champion because this is what happened in the break!”. This left Häkkinen to take victory and his first drivers&#x27; championship. While Irvine succeeded at keeping Coulthard behind him, McLaren were nevertheless able to retain their lead over Ferrari in the constructors&#x27; championship. Behind the top three, Hill overtook his future Jordan teammate Frentzen in the final corner to finish fourth; the extra point elevated Jordan ahead of Benetton in the constructors&#x27; championship.

===Post-race===
After the race, Häkkinen described the situation after the two aborted starts as relieving, saying: &quot;When Michael was forced to start from the back of the grid it raised an enormous amount of pressure from me. The race was not as difficult as others I&#x27;ve had this season. But a lot of that&#x27;s down to the team who kept letting me know where Eddie and Michael were.&quot; Eddie Irvine was quoted saying: &quot;What happened to Michael at the start didn&#x27;t change our tactics for the race, it destroyed them. When Michael went to the back I knew it was up to me. I made a fantastic start and got close to Mika at some points but just couldn&#x27;t manage to get in front.&quot;

<text>The 1999 Australian Grand Prix (formally the 1999 Qantas Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 March 1999 at the Albert Park Circuit. The 57-lap race was the first round of the 1999 Formula One World Championship, the 50th World Championship season in the history of Formula One.

Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard dominated in practice and the opening stage of the race but retired with technical problems; the new McLaren MP4/14 proved to be very fast but not yet reliable, a trait shared by a number of Adrian Newey designed cars. Michael Schumacher also had problems during this eventful race, which gave his Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine the opportunity to take his first Grand Prix victory. He made no mistakes and beat Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher to the finish by a few seconds. It was Frentzen&#x27;s first race at Jordan-Mugen-Honda.

== Report ==
=== Free practice ===

==== Friday ====
Heinz-Harald Frentzen was the first car on track and initially topped the list, but Mika Häkkinen took the lead halfway through the first session. After several improvements he ended the session with a time of 1 minute and 33.213 seconds, with McLaren teammate David Coulthard in second place. The Stewart team performed well; Rubens Barrichello and Johnny Herbert ended the session in sixth and seventh position, behind Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli. The debutants (Marc Gené, Pedro de la Rosa, and Ricardo Zonta) and the returnees (Alessandro Zanardi and Luca Badoer) were at the back of the field, but the final two positions were occupied by Olivier Panis and Michael Schumacher. Both had technical problems and completed only a few laps. Damon Hill, Alexander Wurz, and Badoer had small off-track moments but were able to continue without problems.

Coulthard was fastest for a short while in the second session, but Häkkinen quickly reset the order with a time of 1 minute and 31.985 seconds. On his next attempt, Häkkinen spun and crashed into the wall in the last turn before the main straight, causing the first red flag of the season. The session was stopped for 15 minutes; Häkkinen was unhurt, but the McLaren was badly damaged and his practice session was over. In the final minute Coulthard beat his time by one hundredth of a second. Stewart and Jordan were still looking good with Barrichello in third, ahead of Frentzen, Herbert and Hill.
After the break Michael Schumacher had been the first to go out, but he could not do better than seventh, with a gap of over 1.5 seconds to the McLarens. Several drivers went off the track again including Coulthard, Frentzen, Hill, Ralf Schumacher and Zanardi. The Sauber team had somewhat more serious problems: Pedro Diniz stopped on track as a precaution when warning lights lit up, while his teammate Jean Alesi hit the wall. Zanardi and Zonta also stopped on track; Zonta&#x27;s transmission broke and he ended the session last because of it, just behind de la Rosa, Gené and Badoer.

==== Saturday ====
The first quick time on Saturday was set by Ralf Schumacher, and Frentzen momentarily topped the list as well before Coulthard took the lead. After three improvements his best time was 1 minute and 31.140 seconds, but Häkkinen went marginally quicker just before the break. Gené and Hill spun off into the gravel, while Zonta stopped on track again with transmission problems.
After the break Wurz spun into the tyre barriers and caused a red flag. Both the Sauber drivers, as well as de la Rosa and Trulli ended their session prematurely after a spin, while most drivers missed a corner once or twice, getting used to the lower grip level of the new 4-grooved front tires. Despite that, the dominance of McLaren took on breath-taking form. Häkkinen was fastest with a time of 1 minute and 30.324 seconds, six-tenths quicker than teammate Coulthard and a full 2.2 seconds faster than third man Herbert. The next second covered another 11 cars, down to Ralf Schumacher in 15th place. Hill was fourth, followed by Jacques Villeneuve, who beat Michael Schumacher and did better than his BAR teammate Zonta, who completed only three laps and ended the session last, again.

=== Qualifying ===
The results of the qualifying session were basically the same as the year before: Häkkinen beat Coulthard, while Michael Schumacher lead the rest of the field. After ten minutes, Herbert was the first to go out and set a time, followed by Zanardi who was marginally quicker on his fourth consecutive fast lap. After that, Barrichello took over first place, until the McLarens came out. Häkkinen made a mistake and spoiled his first run, but then took a firm lead with a time of 1 minute and 31.063 seconds. Coulthard was two-tenths slower and spun off into the gravel, but was able to continue. Villeneuve was third fastest for a moment but was beaten by Barrichello and Michael Schumacher, who improved his time to 1 minute and 31.781 seconds. Coulthard&#x27;s next attack on Häkkinen&#x27;s provisional pole time failed by one thousandth of a second. Two laps later he did it, with a time of 1 minute and 30.946 seconds, but Häkkinen countered in the final minute and took the pole position with 1 minute and 30.462 seconds, nearly half a second faster than Coulthard.
Barrichello&#x27;s fourth place behind Michael Schumacher was impressive. Not so impressive were Zanardi&#x27;s 15th place, Alesi&#x27;s 16th and most notably Panis&#x27; 20th position. As in the earlier practice sessions, many drivers left the track momentarily; Michael Schumacher even three times. Gené ended his session in the gravel, and the yellow flags spoiled a quick run for many drivers. To add to Gené&#x27;s problems, Häkkinen&#x27;s very fast lap time at the end of the session had pushed him off the starting grid, because the 107% time was now 1 minute and 36.974 seconds, and with 1 minute 37.013 seconds the Spaniard was 0.039 seconds outside the limit. By the same reasoning, the Minardi team issued an official request that Gené be allowed to start, which was subsequently granted by the Stewarts of the Meeting.

=== Warm up ===
In the pre-race warm up session, Coulthard and Häkkinen took turns setting the fastest time. Eventually Coulthard was quickest with 1 minute and 32.560 seconds, one-tenth ahead of Häkkinen. Panis performed better and beat his qualifying time, while other drivers were having problems. Hill went off and straight into the tyre barriers after the throttle had stuck open, and Zanardi had to switch to the spare car because of electrical problems with his race car. Ralf Schumacher got bogged down in the gravel, while Badoer, Coulthard, Diniz, Fisichella, de la Rosa, Toranosuke Takagi and Wurz all went off the track but were able to continue; Takagi only just missed the barriers. Alesi and Zonta collided when Zonta tried to pass and Alesi closed the door.

=== Race ===
Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard had dominated all sessions throughout the weekend with laptimes over a second quicker than anybody else, and with both cars starting from the front row of the grid, the race was looking to be an easy win for the McLaren team. The first signs of trouble came before the race had even begun; while the other drivers made their way to the dummy grid, pole sitter Häkkinen was still in the pits with a problem. At the last minute the team decided that he would have to use the spare car, and just before the pit lane closed Häkkinen was on his way. The warm up lap started without incidents but when the last cars were lining up for the start, there was smoke coming from the Stewart cars of Rubens Barrichello and Johnny Herbert. Both had an oil leak that had set a small fire underneath the bodywork. The start was aborted and the fires were put out. Barrichello got the spare car and had to start from the pit lane, while Herbert was out of options and became the first retirement of the race. After some delay it was announced that there would be a new race over 57 laps, one less than the originally scheduled 58.
When the new warm up lap was about to start, there was further confusion at McLaren when Häkkinen&#x27;s car was started while it was still in gear. Michael Schumacher had qualified third – right behind Häkkinen on the grid – and while McLaren team-members worked frantically to get Häkkinen underway, Schumacher had to wait, and his engine stalled when the gearbox jumped out of neutral. Further down the field, Takagi&#x27;s engine stalled as well. Despite the visible state of panic at McLaren, Häkkinen managed to get going before the last car had left the grid, and so he was allowed to retake his original pole position on the starting grid. Schumacher on the other hand was not so fortunate and had to start at the back of the grid along with Takagi.

Häkkinen made good use of his pole position at the second race start and took the lead, followed closely by Coulthard, Irvine, Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher and Fisichella. Further back Alesi immediately slowed to a stop with a broken gearbox, while Trulli made a good start from twelfth on the grid and tried to pass Hill in turn three. The cars touched; Hill spun into the gravel and retired, while Trulli continued and took seventh place from Villeneuve on the following lap. Also on lap 2, Zanardi dropped back to 21st. The top six remained unchanged during the opening stages of the race. While the McLarens pulled clear of the rest of the field, Michael Schumacher had started his push to the front and was back up to eleventh after only nine laps. After thirteen laps Häkkinen and Coulthard were leading third-placed Irvine by 18 seconds when Coulthard suddenly came into the pits and retired with transmission problems. One lap later Häkkinen lost his advantage on Irvine when the safety car was deployed; Villeneuve had lost his rear wing on the back straight and he was lucky to touch the wall only slowly after a series of high-speed spins. The race was run behind safety car for three laps while Villeneuve&#x27;s car was removed. Diniz, Zonta and Badoer took the opportunity to try to save time by making a pit stop while the safety car was out.

When the race was restarted on lap 18, Häkkinen seemed to be in trouble again when his car did not accelerate properly, bunching up the cars behind him. Several drivers swerved around the slow McLaren, including Barrichello who was later given a stop-and-go penalty because he passed Michael Schumacher before the start/finish line. After the race the Brazilian claimed that he passed Schumacher accidentally while trying to avoid a collision. Irvine took the lead ahead of Frentzen, Trulli, Ralf Schumacher, and Michael Schumacher, while Häkkinen came into the pits after a slow lap and retired with throttle problems. On lap 19, Zanardi crashed and the safety car was deployed for the second time. Barrichello and Trulli made their pit stops, with Trulli even making two. The race was restarted once again on lap 25. Irvine led followed by Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Michael Schumacher and Diniz.

On lap 27, Michael Schumacher had a puncture but he made it back to the pits. The front wing of his Ferrari had been damaged by vibrations and it was replaced with a wing originally intended for Irvine&#x27;s car, bearing the number 4. On lap 28, Diniz had to retire from 4th with a transmission problem. Barrichello was now 4th, followed by Zonta and Takagi. On the next lap Wurz had a spectacular spin when his rear suspension failed. On lap 32, Barrichello came into the pits to take his stop-and-go penalty. Zonta made his second pit stop. Badoer was 5th for a short while. On lap 34 Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop and dropped to 4th. Three laps later, Irvine and Frentzen pitted at the same time but Irvine kept the lead and rejoined just in front of Fisichella. On lap 38 Fisichella made a pit stop and dropped to 5th behind de la Rosa. Michael Schumacher drove through the pit lane without making a stop. The next lap Michael Schumacher came into the pits again and the steering wheel of his Ferrari was replaced. On lap 40 Barrichello passed Zonta and was now 7th. On lap 41 de la Rosa made his second pit stop and lost his 4th place to Fisichella. Barrichello took 6th from Takagi. On lap 43 Barrichello passed de la Rosa for 5th. With eleven laps to go Zonta came in to have his rear wing checked and rejoined just ahead of race leader Irvine, holding him up for two laps before slowing down with gearbox problems. At the finish line Irvine was first, winning his first Grand Prix, ahead of Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella and Barrichello. De la Rosa was 6th, scoring a point on his Formula One debut.

<text>The 1999 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXVIII Grande Prêmio Marlboro do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 11 April 1999 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo, Brazil. It was the second race of the 1999 Formula One season. The 71-lap race was won by McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen after starting from pole position. Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari with Heinz-Harald Frentzen third for the Jordan team.

Ricardo Zonta did not qualify for the race, after he had injured his left foot in a big crash during Saturday&#x27;s practice.

==Report==

===Background===

====Driver changes====
The race marked the debut for Stéphane Sarrazin, who drove the Minardi for an injured Luca Badoer. Badoer had injured his hand in a testing accident, and Sarrazin - then the test driver for Prost - was drafted in to Minardi.

As Luca Badoer returned for the following race, and he was still the test driver for Prost, it was Stéphane Sarrazin&#x27;s only entry in Formula One.

===Race===
At the start of the race, pole sitter Mika Häkkinen raced off with the lead, while his McLaren teammate David Coulthard stalled on the grid. McLaren at this point had been reeling from a double-DNF at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, and Coulthard&#x27;s failure raised eyebrows at the team. Coulthard&#x27;s car was pushed into the pit lane, where it was restarted as the leaders began lap 4.

On lap 4, local hero Rubens Barrichello took the lead of the race from Mika Häkkinen after Häkkinen&#x27;s car suffered a temporary transmission malfunction and was unable to select any gears. Häkkinen was also passed by Michael Schumacher before his car regained the ability to select gears. Barrichello was able to stay in front until he pitted on lap 27. It was the first time a Stewart car had led a race. The crowd of roughly 80,000 cheered wildly as &quot;Rubinho&quot; built a lead of about 5 seconds over Schumacher.

Alexander Wurz and Damon Hill collided on lap 10, ending Hill&#x27;s race. Rubens Barrichello fell to fourth place after his pit stop, and Michael Schumacher took over the lead. David Coulthard&#x27;s day ended when he pulled off the track with a mechanical failure. Stéphane Sarrazin, in his only F1 entry, had a massive crash on the pit straight on lap 31 after suffering a wing failure, with him spinning more than six times. On lap 35, Barrichello passed Eddie Irvine under braking into the first corner to take third place.

Michael Schumacher came in for a pit stop on lap 38, allowing Mika Häkkinen past. Häkkinen had been held up by Schumacher, so he began trying to build up enough of a gap so he could come out ahead of Schumacher after his own pit stop. Lapped traffic delayed his progress at first, but after one lap he was able to turn in a couple of fast laps. He pitted on lap 42, and his fast laps combined with quick work by his pit crew allowed him to easily retain the lead over Schumacher.

On lap 42, Pedro Diniz spun off and beached his car after trying to pass another car to the inside. Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s race ended on the same lap with a blown engine. Eddie Irvine came in for an unscheduled pit stop on lap 55 to clear the radiators of his overheating Ferrari, dropping him back to fifth.

Mika Häkkinen won the race, with Michael Schumacher second. Heinz-Harald Frentzen was classified third despite running out of fuel on the final lap, as the next car was a lap down. Ralf Schumacher finished fourth after being closely pursued by Eddie Irvine for the last few laps. 10th race win for Mika Häkkinen.

<text>The 1999 San Marino Grand Prix (formally the Gran Premio Warsteiner di San Marino 1999) was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 2 May 1999. It was the third race of the 1999 Formula One World Championship.

The 62-lap race was won by German Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, after he started from third position. Finn Mika Häkkinen took pole position in his McLaren-Mercedes, but crashed out after 17 laps. Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate, Briton David Coulthard, finished second, with Brazilian Rubens Barrichello third in a Stewart-Ford.

==Report==

===Race===
Mika Häkkinen took an instant lead from David Coulthard and Michael Schumacher after the start. Eddie Irvine was ahead of Rubens Barrichello, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Damon Hill and Jean Alesi. Jacques Villeneuve was left stranded on the grid after a clutch problem. In an unforced error, Häkkinen crashed out at the final &quot;Traguardo&quot; chicane on lap 17, allowing David Coulthard into the lead ahead of Michael Schumacher.

This remained unchanged until both drivers made pitstops for fuel and tyres. Schumacher stopped earlier and for a shorter time than Coulthard allowing him to take over the lead from the McLaren driver. Schumacher then gradually expanded his lead to a maximum of about 23 seconds before making a second pit stop. He was able to stay in first place and thereafter comfortably retained his position to secure his first win of the season. 

Meanwhile, Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Irvine had settled in third place following Häkkinen&#x27;s retirement. He was forced to retire from the race himself when his Ferrari engine expired on lap 47. Frentzen span off shortly afterwards on the oil left by Irvine&#x27;s Ferrari. This allowed Hill to inherit third place, but he made his final stop in a three stop strategy two laps later. Barrichello was consequently promoted to third place which he held until the end of the race ahead of Hill.

Johnny Herbert looked set to finish in fifth place until his Ford engine expired coming out of the Villeneuve chicane with three laps remaining. Alessandro Zanardi spun off shortly afterwards on the fluid spread by Herbert&#x27;s stricken Stewart-Ford, allowing Giancarlo Fisichella and Alesi to complete the top six.

<text>The 1999 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the LVII Grand Prix Automobile de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held on 16 May 1999 at the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo, Monaco. It was the fourth race of the 1999 Formula One season. The 78-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from second position. It was Schumacher&#x27;s 16th win with Ferrari, breaking the record held by Niki Lauda. His team-mate Eddie Irvine finished second with Mika Häkkinen third for the McLaren team.

The race was Schumacher&#x27;s second win of the season, his fourth at Monaco, and the result meant that he extended his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, to eight points over Irvine and twelve over Häkkinen. Ferrari extended their lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, twenty-four points ahead of McLaren and twenty-eight ahead of Jordan with 12 races of the season remaining.

==Report==

===Background===
The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, also known as constructors, were McLaren, Ferrari, Williams, Jordan, Benetton, Sauber, Arrows, Stewart, Prost, Minardi and BAR. Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought four different tyre types to the race: two dry compounds, the extra soft and the soft, and two wet-weather compounds, the intermediate and full wet.

Going into the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 16 points, ahead of Eddie Irvine on 12 points and Mika Häkkinen on 10 points. Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fourth with 10 points while Ralf Schumacher was fifth on 10 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship Ferrari were leading with 28 points, McLaren and Jordan were second and third with 16 and 13 points respectively, while Williams with 7 and Stewart with 6 points contended for fourth place. Ferrari had so far dominated the championship, winning two out of the three previous races, with Häkkinen winning the Brazilian Grand Prix. Championship contenders Frentzen and David Coulthard had each gained one second-place finish, and Ralf Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello had achieved third place podium finishes.

Following the San Marino Grand Prix on 2 May, several teams conducted testing sessions at circuits around the world. Ferrari and Minardi headed for Fiorano where testing for the set-up around the Monaco circuit took place. McLaren and Prost tested at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours running over the course of three days, while Prost elected to test for one day. Jordan tested at the Lurcy-Lévis test track with driver Andrew Gilbert-Scott performing aerodynamic mapping runs.

===Practice and qualifying===

Four practice sessions were held before the race; two one-hour sessions on Thursday and two 45 minutes sessions on Saturday. The Friday sessions were held in dry and cloudy conditions. Irvine was the fastest driver in the first session, with a time of 1:18.910 that was less than six-tenths of a second faster than Michael Schumacher. Jordan driver Damon Hill was less than two-tenths of a second off Michael Schumacher&#x27;s pace, with Barrichello, Alessandro Zanardi and Jean Alesi rounding out the top six. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher was fastest with a time of 1:22.718, ahead of Häkkinen, Olivier Panis, Irvine, Giancarlo Fisichella and Coulthard.

Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Each driver was limited to twelve laps. Häkkinen achieved his fourth pole position of the season, his second at the Circuit de Monaco, with a time of 1:20.547. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Michael Schumacher, who was less than one-tenth of a second behind.

===Race===
The conditions for the race were dry with the air temperature and the track temperature . The drivers took to the track at 09:30 (GMT +1) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Ferrari drivers maintained their good pace from qualifying; Michael Schumacher set the fastest time, a 1:23.792. Irvine was second in the other Ferrari car. Both McLaren drivers were just off Irvine&#x27;s pace—Häkkinen ahead of Coulthard—while Hill and Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top six.

Both Ferraris gained a position at the start, with Michael Schumacher taking the lead from Mika Häkkinen, Eddie Irvine and David Coulthard. The order remained this way until lap 35 when Coulthard&#x27;s car began to slow, eventually causing him to retire. Further bad luck befell McLaren a few laps later when Häkkinen went straight on at Mirabeau from oil left after Toranosuke Takagi&#x27;s blown engine. Eddie Irvine moved into 2nd place and stayed there.

On the podium, the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s flag was flown for Irvine.

===Post-race===
The race result left Michael Schumacher extending his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 26 points. Irvine&#x27;s second place ensured that he maintained second position in the Championship with 18 points, four points ahead of Häkkinen and five ahead of Frentzen. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari extended their lead to 44 points, McLaren maintained second with 20 points, with Jordan maintaining third with 16 points, with 12 races of the season remaining.

<text>The 1999 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 30 May 1999 at the Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, Spain. It was the fifth race of the 1999 Formula One season. The 65-lap race was won from pole position by Mika Häkkinen, driving a McLaren-Mercedes, with team-mate David Coulthard second and Michael Schumacher third in a Ferrari.

== Report ==

=== Race ===

Mika Häkkinen, starting on pole for the fifth time in 1999, got off the line quickly and began building a gap between him and second place. David Coulthard and Jacques Villeneuve, starting third and sixth respectively, had great starts and were able to take second and third place by the first corner. Eddie Irvine, starting second, had a poor start and fell to fifth place after being passed by Coulthard, Villeneuve, and then in the second corner, his teammate Michael Schumacher. Olivier Panis and Marc Gené failed to start, with Gené retiring and Panis able to continue on in last place.

The McLaren duo of Häkkinen and Coulthard began building up a substantial gap, with the Ferraris being held up by Villeneuve. Eddie Irvine, on lap 23, became the first of the front runners to pit. Mika Häkkinen came in the next lap, and had built up such a lead that he only fell to second place. Villeneuve and Schumacher both stopped simultaneously, but Villeneuve&#x27;s stop was longer and Schumacher was able to pass Villeneuve in the pits. Irvine was also able to capitalize on Villeneuve&#x27;s slow stop to pass him.

After pitting, Michael Schumacher was initially caught behind Heinz-Harald Frentzen, but once past, he began the task of chasing down David Coulthard, fourteen seconds ahead. Schumacher closed to within a second of Coulthard on lap 41, but he pitted the next lap without making an attempt to pass. Mika Häkkinen pitted the lap after Schumacher, and Coulthard pitted on lap 45. Coulthard&#x27;s stop was slightly faster that Schumacher&#x27;s, and came out just ahead of Schumacher. Schumacher was able to close up behind Coulthard on cold tires, but was unable to pass Coulthard. Once Coulthard&#x27;s tires warmed up, he was able to pull away from Schumacher.

Jacques Villeneuve pitted on lap 40, suffering from a broken rear wing element. The mechanics pulled the broken element off the wing, but first gear broke when Villeneuve tried to leave his pit box, and he retired.

Michael Schumacher made another late charge on David Coulthard as the two battled through the lap traffic of Damon Hill, Rubens Barrichello, and Toranosuke Takagi. Schumacher ran out of time, however, and finished the race in third place behind Coulthard. Mika Häkkinen won the race by over six seconds, marking the first time that both McLarens finished a race in 1999. Only one on-track overtaking manoeuvre was reported.

<text>The 1999 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 13 June 1999 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was the sixth race of the 1999 Formula One season. 

The race was notable for the four crashes that occurred in turn 13 and for the number of times the safety car was deployed. Turn 13, the final chicane, had four separate crashes in which a driver either went wide or spun into the wall. Three of the drivers who crashed there had previously won the Drivers&#x27; Championship, leading to the wall becoming known as the &quot;Wall of Champions&quot;. The safety car was deployed four times in the race, a record at the time, and was the first Formula One race to finish behind the safety car following Heinz-Harald Frentzen&#x27;s crash with four laps to go.

== Report ==

=== Qualifying ===
Michael Schumacher started on pole for the first time in 1999, ahead of Mika Häkkinen and Eddie Irvine.

=== Race ===
The front runners got off the line cleanly, with Michael Schumacher maintaining first place, Häkkinen second, and Irvine third. Behind them Giancarlo Fisichella passed David Coulthard to take fifth place. Jarno Trulli, starting ninth, went off the track trying to pass Heinz-Harald Frentzen up the inside into turn one. Trulli spun across turn one, collecting Jean Alesi and Rubens Barrichello in the process. Trulli and Alesi retired, and the safety car was deployed. Alexander Wurz also retired during the first lap with transmission problems. Barrichello limped back to the pits where repairs were made to his car. He was able to resume the race, albeit two laps down on the leader, but ultimately had to retire because of the collision damage after having completed 14 laps.

The safety car returned to the pits at the end of the second lap, having been deployed for only one lap, allowing normal racing to resume with the top six being Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Irvine, Fisichella, Coulthard and Frentzen.

During the third lap Coulthard passed Fisichella going into turn 13 to retake fourth place. Later that same lap, Ricardo Zonta retired after spinning into the wall at that same turn 13. He stopped just off the track, missing his right rear wheel. This brought the safety car out again. Zonta was the first of four drivers to hit the &quot;Wall of Champions&quot; in this race.

At the end of lap 7 the safety left the track again, allowing the race to resume normally again. The order remained stable until on lap 15, Damon Hill became the second driver to hit the turn 13 wall. He was able to pull off the track in a safe location, and the safety car was not deployed.

During lap 24, Pedro de la Rosa came in to the pits for a scheduled stop, but when trying to leave his gearbox failed. This forced him to retire. One lap later Stewart&#x27;s Johnny Herbert, from seventh position, was the first driver running in the top ten to make a scheduled pit stop. He returned to the track in tenth place.

Michael Schumacher hit the wall at turn 13 on lap 30, giving the lead to Mika Häkkinen. Five laps later, Jacques Villeneuve became the fourth and final driver on the day to hit the wall at that turn, bringing the safety car out for the third time. Hill, Schumacher, and Villeneuve were three of the four Formula 1 Drivers&#x27; Champions competing in the race who hit the wall.

The third safety car period, occurring around the halfway point of the race, was used by many drivers to make a scheduled pitstop. Fisichella, Frentzen, Pedro Diniz, Ralf Schumacher, Herbert, Häkkinen, and Irvine all came into the pits shortly before or after the safety car having been deployed to the circuit.

Near the end of lap 38, David Coulthard passed the safety car before entering the pit lane for his scheduled stop. Shortly afterwards Alessandro Zanardi did the same after coming out of the pit lane following his stop trying to prevent being lapped. Both Coulthard and Zanardi also ignored a red light at the end of the pit lane when exiting following their pit stop.

Following the series of pit stops, the top six behind the safety car was Häkkinen, Irvine, Coulthard, Fisichella, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher. Normal racing restarted again on lap 41. Coulthard tried to go around the outside of Eddie Irvine into turn one, then the inside on turn two. However they touched, and both spun off. Both were able to rejoin, though Coulthard had to pit at the end of the lap. This dropped them to 8th and 10th place respectively while Fisichella and Frentzen took over third and fourth place with Ralf Schumacher and Diniz following in fifth and sixth.

Two laps later Fisichella and Frentzen found themselves trying to lap Luca Badoer and Olivier Panis. However Panis attempted to pass Badoer while approaching turn 13, thus ignoring blue flags being shown to them. Panis was unable to pass before the turn and being on the outside going into it had to yield. This meant he went rather slowly through the turn, forcing Fisichella behind wide which in turn allowed Frentzen to move into third place. On the same lap, Toranosuke Takagi, already two laps from the lead, slowly entered the pit lane to retire his Arrows with transmission problems.

During lap 47 Coulthard, Zanardi, Badoer and Panis were all issued 10 second stop and go penalties. Coulthard and Zanardi for ignoring the red light in the pit lane following their pitstops, Badoer and Panis for ignoring blue flags. The latter three served their penalties on the same lap, while Coulthard followed suit one lap later.

Meanwhile, Irvine continued to move back up the order following the incident with Coulthard. By lap 46 he had moved into seventh place. At the start of lap 47 he passed Diniz for sixth place going into turn one. Six laps later he passed Herbert for fifth place going into turn 13, though both drivers had to cut across the grass. Another five lap later he passed Ralf Schumacher on the same spot to take fourth place. In the meantime, on lap 51, Zanardi retired with brake problems.

The fourth and final safety car of the race came out on lap 66 after Heinz-Harald Frentzen, running in second place, suffered a brake failure whilst approaching turn three and he crashed into the barriers sideways. He was uninjured. The safety car came out at the start of the next lap, with the race finishing under safety car conditions, a first for Formula One, with Mika Häkkinen victorious. Eddie Irvine scored his first fastest lap and finished third behind Giancarlo Fisichella.

<text>The 1999 French Grand Prix (formally the LXXXV Mobil 1 Grand Prix de France) was a Formula One motor race held on 27 June 1999 at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours near Magny-Cours, France. It was the seventh race of the 1999 Formula One season. The 72-lap race was won by Heinz-Harald Frentzen driving a Jordan car after starting from fifth position. Mika Häkkinen finished second driving for McLaren, with Rubens Barrichello finishing third for the Stewart team. The remaining points-scoring positions were filled by Ralf Schumacher (Williams), Michael Schumacher (Ferrari), Eddie Irvine (Ferrari).

As a consequence of the race, Häkkinen extended his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to eight points over Schumacher, with Irvine a further 14 behind. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren reduced the lead over Ferrari to six points with Williams passing Benetton for fourth position, 43 points behind Ferrari.

== Report ==

===Background===
Heading into the seventh round of the season, McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen was leading the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 34 points; Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was second on 30 points, 4 points behind Häkkinen. Behind Häkkinen and Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Eddie Irvine was third on 25 points in the other Ferrari, with Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Giancarlo Fisichella both on 13 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari were leading on 55 points and McLaren were second on 46 points, with Jordan third on 16 points.

Following the Canadian Grand Prix on 13 June, the teams conducted testing sessions at the Magny-Cours circuit from 16 to 18 June. David Coulthard (McLaren) set the fastest time on the first day, while Eddie Irvine was fastest on the second and final day of testing. Williams made modifications to the suspension of their cars, resulting in several spins. Among the other teams, Minardi elected to perform aerodynamic mapping work at the Automotive Safety Center using their test driver Gastón Mazzacane. Arrows performed shakedown runs at the Santa Pod Raceway.

On 16 June, Jordan driver and 1996 World Drivers&#x27; Champion Damon Hill announced that he would retire from Formula One racing at the end of the season. Hill later said a factor in his decision was the amount of testing undertaken by the teams and his own personal performance during the season, although he considered retiring with immediate effect.

===Practice and qualifying===
Two practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday from 11:00 to 14:00 local time, and a second on Saturday morning between 09:00 to 11:00. The first practice session took place in dry conditions. The ambient temperature was .

The second practice session was held in overcast and wet weather conditions, with a drop in the track temperature to and the ambient temperature to .

Saturday afternoon&#x27;s qualifying session was held from 13:00 to 14:00 local time. Each driver was limited to twelve laps with the implementation of a 107% rule to exclude slow drivers from competing in the race. The session was held in wet conditions; the ambient and track temperature were both . Rubens Barrichello clinched his first pole position of the season, in his Stewart, in a time of 1:38.441. He was joined on the front row by Jean Alesi, who was four-tenths of a second behind. Olivier Panis was third in his Prost. Coulthard took fourth despite going into the gravel and spinning off late in the session. Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fifth, with Michael Schumacher completing the top six.

Due to the wet conditions, a then-record five drivers - Damon Hill, Marc Gené, Luca Badoer, Pedro de la Rosa, and Toranosuke Takagi - all failed to meet the 107% time. Hill missed out by just three milliseconds, the slimmest-ever margin. Due to the wet conditions, and the drivers&#x27; competitiveness in practice, all five drivers were permitted to race due to &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.

=== Race ===
On Sunday morning, a pre-race warm up session took place at 09:30 local time, and lasted for 30 minutes. It took place in wet weather conditions, with the track temperature at and the ambient temperature was . Coulthard set the fastest lap with a time of 1:32.091. He was followed on the timesheets by Ferrari drivers Irvine and Michael Schumacher who completed the top three positions.

The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time, and started on a dry track, with an ambient temperature of and a track temperature of . Rubens Barrichello managed to get away quickly to maintain first position. Jean Alesi, starting second, was slower than Barrichello and held up drivers after the start. David Coulthard was able to pass Alesi on lap two. Mika Häkkinen stormed up through the field from his starting position of fourteenth to ninth place by lap two. Häkkinen caught and passed Olivier Panis for sixth place and then caught Michael Schumacher in fifth on lap five. As this happened Herbert retired thanks to a gearbox problem. Coulthard passed Barrichello on lap six by outbraking him into the Adelaide hairpin. And then Diniz retired thanks to transmission failure on lap 7. Mika Häkkinen attempted to pass Michael Schumacher on lap nine by slipstreaming him down the long straight before the Adelaide hairpin, but was on the outside coming into Adelaide and Schumacher was able to stay just ahead. Häkkinen repeated the move on the very next lap, this time to the inside, and was able to stay in front of Schumacher. Schumacher at this point was struggling on a car that was set up for a wet race.

David Coulthard suffered a complete electrical failure (alternator failure) on lap 10 and retired, giving the lead back to Rubens Barrichello. Mika Häkkinen caught Heinz-Harald Frentzen on lap 12, then hounded him for three laps before passing him in a repeat of the move he had pulled on Michael Schumacher earlier. Frentzen tried to fight back, and was able to pull alongside Häkkinen, but Häkkinen&#x27;s inside line through turn six cemented his position. Behind in the midfield Irvine overtook another car. This time it was Alexander Wurz in the Benetton. On Lap 16 Häkkinen caught up with Jean Alesi quickly, but was stuck behind him for several more laps. Häkkinen used the slipstream to pull alongside Alesi on lap 19, but they both locked up into Adelaide and only barely made the corner. Häkkinen was able to stay ahead, and began to chase down Barrichello, four and a half seconds ahead.

Rain began to fall on lap 21. Eddie Irvine pulled into the pits just as the rain started, but Ferrari was not ready for him and his pit stop took 43 seconds (42.9) after his mechanics initially put a fresh set of dry-weather tyres on his car. Well after the Irvine pit stop disaster happened Giancarlo Fisichella spun, without retiring. A scramble into the pits ensued, but the leaders were all able to hold their positions. One lap after Hill pitted he got a puncture, because he hit a wall. Jean Alesi spun out of third place on lap 25 in Chateaux d&#x27;Eau and retired, because he beached his car in the gravel. The safety car was then deployed due to the amount of water on the track. On Lap 26 Villeneuve pitted for wet tyres, and before Villeneuve pitted Zonta spun. The amount of water on the track was so great that four drivers – Jacques Villeneuve, Alexander Wurz, Marc Gené and Alessandro Zanardi – spun while following the safety car. On Lap 29 Takagi pitted for a new nose. Damon Hill retired with electrical failure while behind the safety car. The safety car came in at the end of lap 35. The restart went cleanly, with no place changes amongst the front-runners.

Mika Häkkinen made a dive-bomb attempt to pass Rubens Barrichello under braking into Adelaide on lap 38, but he put his inside wheels up onto the curbing and spun the car a full 360 degrees. Mika Häkkinen fell to seventh place. Michael Schumacher passed Heinz-Harald Frentzen through Adelaide on the next lap. Schumacher made a very late braking move to momentarily pass Barrichello into Adelaide on lap 42, but he went very wide and Barrichello cut back under Schumacher to retake the lead. Schumacher repeated the move two laps later, but this time he didn&#x27;t go wide and was able to gain first place.
After 47 laps, a long train formed behind Olivier Panis in fourth, with Ralf Schumacher, Eddie Irvine, and Mika Häkkinen being held up behind him. Ralf Schumacher got past Panis on lap 50, and then Irvine came into the pits, sticking with wet tyres. Häkkinen got a good run out of Adelaide on lap 51 and passed Panis for fifth place into Nurburgring corner. On the same lap, Michael Schumacher suffered an electrical malfunction and lost most of his eight-second lead to Rubens Barrichello. He pitted three laps later, changing his steering wheel in addition to tyres. Mika Häkkinen got past Heinz-Harald Frentzen for second place on lap 57, with Frentzen running wide at Adelaide. Häkkinen passed Barrichello on lap 60 to retake the lead.

Mika Häkkinen and Rubens Barrichello pitted for extra fuel on lap 66, which let Heinz-Harald Frentzen through into the lead. During Frentzen&#x27;s one and only pit stop to change onto wet tyres, the Jordan team had fortuitously filled his car with enough fuel to finish the race. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher on lap 70, with Michael Schumacher appearing to still have car trouble. Frentzen won the race after 72 laps to secure his first victory of the season in a time of 1:58.24.343. Häkkinen held position to finish second, with Barrichello third, 43 seconds behind.

===Post-race===
The top three finishers appeared on the podium and in the subsequent press conference. Damon Hill hinted after the race that this one could have been his last, or if he did compete at Silverstone in the next race he might leave Formula One afterwards. Toranosuke Takagi was disqualified for using tyres which had been marked for his team-mate, Pedro de la Rosa.

As a consequence of the race, Häkkinen extended his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to eight points over Schumacher, with Irvine a further 14 behind. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren reduced the lead over Ferrari to six points with Williams passing Benetton for fourth position, 43 points behind Ferrari.

=== Qualifying ===
:1. Damon Hill, Marc Gené, Luca Badoer, Pedro de la Rosa and Toranosuke Takagi all failed to set a lap time within the 107% limit, but were allowed to race due to poor weather conditions during qualifying. They were ordered in grid by free practice times, therefore Hill started 18th, de la Rosa 19th, Takagi 20th, Badoer 21st and Gené 22nd.

<text>The 1999 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 11 July 1999 at the Silverstone Circuit near Silverstone, England. It was the eighth race of the 1999 Formula One season. The 60-lap race was won by McLaren driver David Coulthard after he started from third position. Eddie Irvine finished second for the Ferrari team and Williams driver Ralf Schumacher came in third.

Jacques Villeneuve and Alessandro Zanardi both stalled on the grid. The race was red flagged due to Race Director Charlie Whiting accidentally hitting the red flag button instead of the pit exit open button. While the red flags were out, Michael Schumacher crashed at Stowe corner due to brake failure, breaking his leg. This would keep him out of Formula One until the Malaysian Grand Prix, ending his championship hopes.

Following a difficult season Damon Hill performed well to finish 5th in his home race and seemed happy enough to carry on for the rest of the season. He had also briefly led the race for a lap, which was the last time he would lead a Grand Prix.

This was Toranosuke Takagi&#x27;s final classified Formula One race finish. He failed to finish each of his subsequent eight races.

This was McLaren team&#x27;s first British Grand Prix victory since 1989.
The podiums of Coulthard and Irvine (for 1st and 2nd) also marked the last time two drivers racing under a British flag would stand together on the podium at their home event at until the 2023 British Grand Prix where Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton finished second and third.

<doc id="1123353" wikidata="Q2174657" url="?curid=1123353" title="Phosphorus-32">
<text>Phosphorus-32 (32P) is a radioactive isotope of phosphorus. The nucleus of phosphorus-32 contains 15 protons and 17 neutrons, one more neutron than the most common isotope of phosphorus, phosphorus-31. Phosphorus-32 only exists in small quantities on Earth as it has a short half-life of 14 days and so decays rapidly.

Phosphorus is found in many organic molecules, and so, phosphorus-32 has many applications in medicine, biochemistry, and molecular biology where it can be used to trace phosphorylated molecules (for example, in elucidating metabolic pathways) and radioactively label DNA and RNA.

==Decay==
Phosphorus-32 has a short half-life of 14.268 days and decays into sulfur-32 by beta decay as shown in this nuclear equation:
1.709 MeV of energy is released from this decay. The kinetic energy of the electron varies with an average of approximately 0.5 MeV and the remainder of the energy is carried by the nearly undetectable electron antineutrino. In comparison to other beta radiation-emitting nuclides, the electron is moderately energetic. It is blocked by around 1 m of air or 5 mm of acrylic glass.

The sulfur-32 nucleus produced is in the ground state, so there is no additional gamma ray emission.

==Production==

Phosphorus-32 has important uses in medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology. It only exists naturally on earth in very small amounts and its short half-life means useful quantities have to be produced synthetically. Phosphorus-32 can be generated synthetically by irradiation of sulfur-32 with moderately fast neutrons as shown in this nuclear equation:
The sulfur-32 nucleus captures the neutron and emits a proton, reducing the atomic number by one while maintaining the mass number of 32.

This reaction has also been used to determine the yield of nuclear weapons.

==Uses==
Phosphorus is abundant in biological systems and, as a radioactive isotope, is almost chemically identical with stable isotopes of the same element. Phosphorus-32 can be used to label biological molecules. The beta radiation emitted by the phosphorus-32 is sufficiently penetrating to be detected outside the organism or tissue which is being analysed

===Biochemistry and molecular biology===
The metabolic pathways of organisms extensively use phosphorus in the generation of different biomolecules within the cell. Phosphorus-32 finds use for analysing metabolic pathways in pulse chase experiments, where a culture of cells is treated for a short time with a phosphorus-32-containing substrate. The sequence of chemical changes, which happen to the substrate, can then be traced by detecting which molecules contain the phosphorus-32 at multiple time points following the initial treatment.

DNA and RNA contain a large quantity of phosphorus in the phosphodiester linkages between bases in the oligonucleotide chain. DNA and RNA can therefore be tracked by replacing the phosphorus with phosphorus-32. This technique is extensively used in Southern blot and Northern blot analysis of DNA and RNA samples respectively. In both cases, a phosphorus-32-containing DNA probe hybridises to its complementary sequence, where it appears in a gel. Its location can then be detected by photographic film.

===Plant sciences===
Phosphorus-32 is used in plant sciences for tracking a plant&#x27;s uptake of fertiliser from the roots to the leaves. The phosphorus-32-labelled fertiliser is given to the plant hydroponically, or via water in the soil, and the usage of the phosphorus can be mapped from the emitted beta radiation. The information gathered by mapping the fertiliser uptake shows how the plant takes up and uses the phosphorus from fertiliser.

==Safety==
The high energy of emitted beta particles and the low half-life of phosphorus-32 make it potentially harmful; Its molar activity is 338.61 TBq/mmol (9151.6 Ci/mmol) and its specific activity is 10.590 EBq/kg (286.22 kCi/g). Typical safety precautions when working with phosphorus-32 include wearing a personal dosimeter to monitor exposure and an acrylic or perspex radiation shield to protect the body. Dense shielding, such as lead, is less effective due to the high-energy bremsstrahlung produced by the interaction of the beta particle and the shielding. Because the beta radiation from phosphorus-32 is blocked by around 1 m of air, it is also advisable to wear dosimeters on the parts of the body, for example the fingers, which come into close contact with the phosphorus-32-containing sample.

<doc id="1123354" wikidata="Q2404445" url="?curid=1123354" title="Strontium-89">
<text>Strontium-89 () is a radioactive isotope of strontium produced by nuclear fission, with a half-life of 50.57 days. It undergoes β− decay into yttrium-89. Strontium-89 has an application in medicine.

== History ==
Strontium-89 was first synthesized in 1937 by D. W. Stewart et al. at the University of Michigan; it was synthesized via irradiation of stable strontium (88Sr) with deuterons. Biological properties and applications of strontium-89 were studied for the first time by Belgian scientist Charles Pecher. Pecher filed a patent in May 1941 for the synthesis of strontium-89 and yttrium-86 using cyclotrons, and described the therapeutic use of strontium.

==Physiological effects and medical use==
Strontium belongs to the same periodic family as calcium (alkaline earth metals), and is metabolised in a similar fashion, preferentially targeting metabolically active regions of the bone. 89Sr is an artificial radioisotope used in the treatment of osseous (bony) metastases of bone cancer.

In circumstances where cancer patients have widespread and painful bony metastases, the administration of 89Sr results in the delivery of beta particles directly to the area of bony problem, where calcium turnover is greatest. Consequently, intravenous or intracavity administration of 89Sr may be helpful in the palliation of painful bony metastases, as it allows radiation to be targeted at metastatic lesions, inducing apoptosis of cells, membrane and protein damage. Subsequently, bone pain resulting from cytokine release at the site of lesions, bone-associated nerve compression and stretching of the periosteum may be reduced. Treatment with 89Sr has been particularly effective in patients with hormonally-resistant prostate cancer, often leading to a decreased requirement for opioid analgesics, an increase in time until further radiation is needed, and a decrease in tumour markers.

<text>The 1999 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 25 July 1999 at the A1-Ring in Spielberg, Austria. It was the ninth race of the 1999 Formula One season.

After Michael Schumacher broke his leg in the previous race at Silverstone, Ferrari&#x27;s title attention turned to his teammate Eddie Irvine. David Coulthard nudged teammate Mika Häkkinen off the track on the first lap, pushing Häkkinen to the back. When Coulthard failed to hold off Irvine during the sole round of pitstops, the man from Northern Ireland wrapped up his 2nd Formula One win. Häkkinen fought through the field to finish 3rd. Mika Salo substituted for Schumacher, while Pedro Diniz scored his last world championship points at this race.

<text>The 1999 German Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland 1999) was a Formula One motor race held on 1 August 1999 at the Hockenheimring near Hockenheim, Germany. It was the tenth race of the 1999 FIA Formula One World Championship. With Michael Schumacher out injured, Eddie Irvine took a second successive victory as he chased the championship, aided by stand-in team-mate Mika Salo moving over to give him the lead. In the early laps Finnish drivers ran first and second. However, Mika Häkkinen ultimately crashed out on lap 25 due to a tyre failure, allowing Heinz-Harald Frentzen to finish third in his home Grand Prix.

Damon Hill was again rumoured to be leaving Formula One when he allegedly retired a healthy car. Hill claimed that his Jordan had brake problems. Eddie Irvine gave his winner&#x27;s trophy to Mika Salo, who was leading towards the end of the race and moved over on team orders.

=== Qualifying ===
=== Race ===
At the start, the start, Jacques Villeneuve was touched from behind, dove inside, and touched Pedro Diniz, knocking both out at the first corner. At the front, Frentzen had a bad start and was overtaken by Mika Salo and David Coulthard, while Rubens Barrichello passed Eddie Irvine. In midfield, Olivier Panis tangled with Ralf Schumacher at Senna corner and damaged his car; at the rear, Jean Alesi had to pit at the end of the first lap. So, the order was Mika Hakkinen, Mika Salo, Coulthard, Frentzen, Barrichello, and Irvine.

Barrichello passed Frentzen at Agip corner on lap 2 and started to pressure Coulthard, only to see his engine blow up on lap 6. Coulthard closed in on Mika Salo and dove for a maneuver at Ost Kurve on lap 9, but lost a winglet and had to pit. On lap 11 the order was Hakkinen, Salo, Frentzen, Irvine, Ralf Schumacher, and Alexander Wurz.

The Scotsman, who was on a mission to climb the field after his unscheduled pit stop, overtook Olivier Panis off the track only to be penalized with a Stop &amp; Go. The leaders started their mandatory pits, and the first one to stop was Frentzen, only to be overcut by Irvine one lap later. Mika Salo pitted for good and came back just in front of his teammate, putting both Ferraris in podium positions.

If McLaren&#x27;s journey wasn&#x27;t a dream given Coulthard&#x27;s faults, it became a complete nightmare when Hakkinen pitted for the lead and his fuel pump didn&#x27;t work. The team had to change it for David&#x27;s one, costing the Finn 24.3 seconds stopped and his fall to fourth place. On lap 26, Hakkinen passed Frentzen at the first chicane and started to pursue the Ferrari duo. However, on the straight before the Stadium section, his rear left tire exploded, his rear wing broke, and he spun off into the tire barrier, retiring from the race and potentially losing his lead in the championship. On the same lap, Salo and Irvine swapped positions, putting the Ulsterman in first. On lap 27 the order was Irvine, Salo, Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Panis, and Coulthard.

After those incidents, the other two casualties were Pedro de la Rosa&#x27;s accident and Johnny Herbert retiring after a good journey, but suffering from reliability problems once again. In the closing stages, Coulthard passed Panis for fifth place and the order remained the same until the chequered flag.

<text>The 1999 Belgian Grand Prix (formally the LVII Foster&#x27;s Belgian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 August 1999 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Francorchamps, Belgium. It was the twelfth race of the 1999 Formula One World Championship.

The 44-lap race was won by British driver David Coulthard, driving a McLaren-Mercedes, after he started from second position. Finn Mika Häkkinen took pole position in the other McLaren-Mercedes, but Coulthard overtook him at the first corner and went on to lead all 44 laps. Häkkinen finished second, some 10 seconds behind, with German Heinz-Harald Frentzen third in a Jordan-Mugen-Honda.

Häkkinen took back the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship by one point from Eddie Irvine, who finished fourth in his Ferrari, while McLaren moved into the lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship, nine points ahead of Ferrari.

Former world Champion Damon Hill scored his last points at this race.

==Report==

===Background===
The Grand Prix was contested by 22 drivers, in eleven teams of two. The teams, also known as Constructors, were McLaren, Ferrari, Williams, Jordan, Benetton, Sauber, Arrows, Stewart, Prost, Minardi and BAR.

Before the race, Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship on 56 points; McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen was second on 54 points. Behind them in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, David Coulthard was third on 36 points in the other McLaren, with Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Michael Schumacher on 36 and 32 points respectively. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari were leading on 94 points and McLaren were second on 90 points, with Jordan third on 42 points.

Following the Hungarian Grand Prix on 15 August, the teams conducted testing sessions at the Silverstone circuit on 17–19 August. Häkkinen set the fastest time on the first, second and final days of testing. Ferrari traveled to their testing circuit at Mugello on 18–20 August, running Schumacher on the final day after being cleared by doctors to test. After completing 20 laps, Schumacher suffered from ankle pain preventing him completing a physical training programme. Ferrari later announced that temporary replacement Mika Salo would continue to race for the team.

Several teams announced changes to their driver line-ups for the following season. Benetton confirmed that the team was retaining their driver line-up of Giancarlo Fisichella and Alexander Wurz, with an option for 2001. Sauber announced that it would sign up Salo on a two-year contract and retain Pedro Diniz. Jordan confirmed that it was signing Prost driver Jarno Trulli on a two-year contract, replacing Damon Hill.

===Practice and qualifying===

Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final practice sessions were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday sessions were held in dry and sunny conditions. Häkkinen was quickest in the first session, with a time of 1:54.396 that was less than half a second faster than Coulthard. Williams driver Ralf Schumacher was just off Coulthard&#x27;s pace; Salo, Irvine and Jean Alesi rounded out the top six; within 1.3 seconds of Häkkinen&#x27;s time. In the second practice session, Coulthard was fastest with a time of 1:53.577, ahead of Häkkinen, Fisichella, Frentzen, Hill and Schumacher.
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Each driver was limited to twelve laps. Häkkinen clinched his tenth pole position of the season with a time of 1:50.329. He was joined on the front row by Coulthard, who was one-tenth of a second behind. Frentzen qualified third, though be believed he could have gone faster due to two separate red flag incidents.

BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta both suffered massive, high-speed accidents at the fast Eau Rouge sweep during the qualifying session. Both accidents caused the session to be suspended.

===Race===
The conditions were dry for the race with the air temperature and the track temperature . The drivers took to the track at 09:30 (UTC +2) for a 30-minute warm-up session.

Coulthard took the lead from Häkkinen at the start by going around the outside of La Source, the McLaren team-mates making light contact. After emerging ahead, Coulthard led every lap of the race to claim his second victory of the season, ten seconds ahead of his team-mate. Häkkinen refused to shake Coulthard&#x27;s hand after the race.

Heinz-Harald Frentzen finished third, with the rest of the top six completed by Eddie Irvine, Ralf Schumacher and Damon Hill. This would prove to be Hill&#x27;s final points scoring finish in Formula 1. Jacques Villeneuve managed to see the chequered flag for the first time of the season.

It was the thirteenth race of the 1999 Formula One World Championship, and the last held on this layout.

The 53-lap race was won by Heinz-Harald Frentzen, driving a Jordan-Mugen-Honda, after McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen, seeking to defend his Drivers&#x27; Championship title, spun off while leading comfortably. Ralf Schumacher was second in a Williams-Supertec, with Mika Salo third in a Ferrari. Häkkinen&#x27;s rival Eddie Irvine finished sixth in the other Ferrari, thus moving level on points with the Finn at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Though the victory moved Frentzen to within ten points of Häkkinen and Irvine, it would turn out to be his third and last victory in Formula One, as well as the last for engine suppliers Mugen. It was also the Jordan team&#x27;s only victory in dry conditions, their others coming in the rain.

===Qualifying===
Going into the race, McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen led the Drivers&#x27; Championship by a single point from Ferrari&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, with Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Häkkinen&#x27;s team-mate David Coulthard also still in contention. Häkkinen was expected to do well on the fast Monza circuit, and duly claimed pole position by half a second from Frentzen. Coulthard was third, while Alessandro Zanardi, who had been having a poor year with Williams, was fourth, just ahead of teammate Ralf Schumacher. On Ferrari&#x27;s home soil, Irvine had a poor qualifying session and could only manage eighth, behind teammate Mika Salo in sixth and Stewart&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello – who had just signed with Ferrari to replace Irvine in – in seventh. Completing the top ten were Damon Hill in the second Jordan and Olivier Panis in the Prost.

===Race===
At the start, Häkkinen led away while Zanardi shot past Coulthard and Frentzen into second. Frentzen quickly re-passed Zanardi, but Coulthard fell further back, behind Schumacher and Salo. Meanwhile, at the back of the field, Minardi&#x27;s Marc Gené tangled with Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa at the Roggia chicane and became the first retirement, while on the second lap Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella and Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz both spun off at the Rettifilo chicane.

On lap 3, Zanardi ran over a kerb and damaged the underside of his car. He managed to hold on to third place for another 15 laps, while Häkkinen and Frentzen pulled away. Barrichello passed Coulthard on lap 11 and then Salo on lap 19, while Zanardi waved Schumacher past on lap 18. On lap 24, there was more drama at the back as Toranosuke Takagi in the second Arrows tried to overtake Luca Badoer in the second Minardi at the Rettifilo, only to run into the back of Badoer and end his race.

Barrichello overtook Zanardi on lap 26; Salo did the same at the start of lap 28. At this point, Häkkinen led Frentzen by eight seconds, with Schumacher a further two-and-a-half seconds back. But on lap 30, going into the Rettifilo, Häkkinen made a mistake changing gear – selecting first instead of second – and spun off, in a virtual repeat of his unforced error at San Marino earlier in the year. In a rare show of emotion, the Finn burst into tears at the side of the track.

Frentzen thus inherited the lead as the front-runners began to make their pit stops. When these had been completed, Salo had moved back ahead of Barrichello and into third, while Coulthard and Irvine had both leapfrogged Zanardi and were now fifth and sixth.

Over the closing laps, Frentzen retained a comfortable lead over Schumacher – despite the Williams driver setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 48 – while Coulthard tried unsuccessfully to find a way past Barrichello, allowing Salo to pull away from both of them. Frentzen&#x27;s eventual margin of victory was 3.2 seconds, with a further eight seconds back to Salo and another six back to Barrichello. Coulthard finished half a second behind the Stewart driver, but nine ahead of Irvine, who himself held off Zanardi for the final point.

This point moved Irvine level with Häkkinen in the Drivers&#x27; Championship on 60 points apiece, while the win put Frentzen just ten points behind on 50, with Coulthard on 48. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari cut McLaren&#x27;s lead to six points, 108 to 102.

<text>The Supporters&#x27; Shield is an annual award given to the Major League Soccer team with the best regular season record, as determined by the MLS points system. The Supporters&#x27; Shield has been annually awarded at the MLS Supporters&#x27; Summit since 1999 (with the winners between 1996 and 1998 awarded retroactively), and has been recognized as a major trophy by the league. It echoes the practice of the top European leagues in which the team with the best record is the champion. Since 2006, the Supporters&#x27; Shield winner has earned a berth in the CONCACAF Champions Cup.

D.C. United and LA Galaxy, with four Supporters&#x27; Shields each, have won the most shields of any MLS team. Inter Miami CF are the 2024 holders of the Supporters&#x27; Shield, winning it for the first time. Inter Miami CF currently holds the record for most dominant win with 74 points for the 2024 season.

== History ==

=== Conception and fundraising ===

When Major League Soccer had its inaugural season in 1996, the league resembled its contemporary North American leagues. After the regular season, the campaign culminated with the MLS Cup Playoffs, en route to the postseason championship match, the MLS Cup. The club with the best regular season record received nothing more than the top seed in the playoffs.

In 1997, soccer fan Nick Lawrus on a listserv proposed the notion of a &quot;Supporters&#x27; Scudetto&quot;, as a result of the Tampa Bay Mutiny earning the best regular season record but failing to win the 1996 MLS Cup Final. A committee composed of members of all MLS teams&#x27; supporters changed the name to &quot;Supporters&#x27; Shield&quot; but, due to disagreements between members of the committee, the proposal failed to come to fruition.

The following year, another group led by soccer enthusiast Sam Pierron tried to revive the idea by giving an award to the regular season champions. Since MLS refused to fund the idea, Pierron began fundraising to purchase a trophy with the help of supporters from various MLS clubs. Fundraising was boosted with donations from ESPN commentator Phil Schoen and MLS commissioner Doug Logan. In the end, nearly $3,000 was donated to commission the trophy, which was a chevron made by University of Missouri-Kansas City art student Paula Richardson out of sterling silver sheet metal, for $2,200.

The process to create and purchase the Supporters&#x27; Shield was not completed until the last weeks of the 1999 season. Although D.C. United were the first MLS club to win the award, the first-place finishes between 1996 and 1998 have all been awarded the honor retroactively, with their names included on the shield at the time of its creation.

Throughout the early to mid-2000s, the Shield received little praise or recognition from MLS or the general public, as the league awarded the MLS Cup winner and runner-up with spots in continental tournaments.

=== First Shield incentives arrive ===

In February 2006, USSF decided that the Supporters&#x27; Shield winner and the MLS Cup winner would represent the United States in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. If the Supporters Shield winner also wins the MLS Cup, the U.S. Open Cup, or if either spot is won by a Canadian team, the U.S.-based team with the second-highest regular season point total qualifies as well. When the Champions Cup became the CONCACAF Champions League, the United States Soccer Federation gave both the Supporters&#x27; Shield winner and the MLS Cup winner direct Group stage spots.

On eight occasions (1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2011, 2017, and 2022) the winner of the Supporters&#x27; Shield also won the MLS Cup that same year, becoming the overall champion of the MLS season. In 2011, the league announced that the Shield winner&#x27;s opponent in the MLS Cup quarterfinals would be the lowest-seeded team remaining.

=== Redesign ===

As the Shield began to become more prized and grow in significance along with &quot;supporter culture&quot; growing throughout the league, the idea of creating a new Supporters&#x27; Shield began at the MLS Supporters Summit during the 2010 MLS Cup in Toronto. The idea continued to gain traction at the then recently formed Independent Supporters Council (ISC) the following two years in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon. The Supporter&#x27;s Shield Foundation was created out of the ISC meeting in Portland in 2012 with a mission to fund the creation of a new shield and to promote and manage the trophy going forward. The cost of the new Shield was quoted at $18,000 with a majority of the funds raised through the &quot;I Support the Shield&quot; scarf drive that culminated in the sale of 2000 supporter scarves.

With the fundraising complete, in early 2013 the new Supporter&#x27;s Shield was created. The new shield weighs and is made of sterling silver and stainless steel. The outside of the shield contains a Telstar football design while the middle of the shield pays homage to the chevron design of the original trophy. The middle of the trophy was designed to be expandable as its winners&#x27; names are added to it annually around the chevron. The newly designed shield was first awarded to the New York Red Bulls on the final day of the 2013 MLS season.

=== 2020 cancellation and reinstatement ===

On October 17, 2020, Major League Soccer announced that, following a decision made by the ISC, the Supporters&#x27; Shield would not be awarded at the end of the 2020 regular season, largely in part due to the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the league. In an official announcement, the Supporters&#x27; Shield Foundation stated, &quot;After much consideration and discussion, the Supporters&#x27; Shield Foundation has decided to forego awarding the Supporters&#x27; Shield for the 2020 season. This is not an easy decision to make. With the inability for supporters to be in attendance and fill their stadiums with passion, however, we feel as though the current climate goes against the spirit of the Shield.&quot;

This decision caused a great amount of backlash from the MLS community, and was criticized by several members of MLS clubs, including Toronto FC head coach Greg Vanney (whose team was top of the Supporters&#x27; Shield standings at the time of the decision). Following these negative responses, on October 23 the Supporters&#x27; Shield Foundation announced they had reversed their original decision, and the Shield was reinstated for the 2020 season. The Philadelphia Union won the Supporters&#x27; Shield, but were unable to use the actual shield due to a delay in shipping from Los Angeles. A temporary replacement was fashioned from a repurposed Captain America shield with a vinyl cover by the Union&#x27;s fabricator shop and lifted by the players.

== Winners ==

;Keys

Sixteen different teams have won at least one Supporters&#x27; Shield, with the LA Galaxy and D.C. United level with the most wins at four each. Seven teams have gone on to win the MLS Cup after winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield, with both the Galaxy and D.C. achieving this double twice. While three teams have secured a Supporters&#x27; Shield and U.S. Open Cup double, no American team has won all three major domestic trophies (the Supporters&#x27; Shield, MLS Cup and U.S. Open Cup). However, in the 2017 season, Toronto FC managed the Canadian version of this achievement, lifting the Supporters&#x27; Shield, MLS Cup and Canadian Championship.

=== Shield winners ===


=== Performance in CONCACAF competition ===
Before 2006, Shield winners were not guaranteed a berth into CONCACAF competitions. Most regular season champions to earn berths into CONCACAF competitions typically earned them from earning a berth into the MLS Cup, or earning a berth due to the number of berths allocated to the United States for MLS. Most times, the United States was allocated two berths into the tournament, which went to the MLS Cup champion and runner-up.

Since 2007, the Shield winner replaced the MLS Cup runner-up as the second American representative for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. In 2008, with the arrival of the newly formatted CONCACAF Champions League, the Shield winner, along with the MLS Cup winner both earned direct byes into the group stage of the Champions League.

Toronto FC and Los Angeles FC are the only Shield winners to reach the final of a CONCACAF competition. However, as a Canadian team, Toronto FC qualified for the tournament by winning the Canadian Championship and not the Supporters&#x27; Shield. D.C. United and the New York Red Bulls hold the record for the earliest exit in a CONCACAF competition as the Shield winners, being eliminated from the group stage in the 2008–09 and 2014–15 editions of the Champions League, respectively.

<text>John William Gardner (October 8, 1912 – February 16, 2002) was Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) under President Lyndon Johnson. He was a strong advocate for citizen participation and founded Common Cause; he became known as &quot;the father of campaign finance reform&quot;.

==Education and military service==
A native of California, Gardner attended Stanford University. As an undergrad he set several swimming records and won a number of Pacific Coast championships, and graduated &quot;with great distinction.&quot; After earning a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1938, Dr. Gardner taught at Connecticut College and at Mount Holyoke.

During the early days of World War II he was chief of the Latin American Section, Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service. He subsequently entered the United States Marine Corps and was assigned to the O.S.S., serving in Italy and Austria.

== Early career ==
Gardner joined the staff of the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1946, and in 1955 he became president of that group, and concurrently, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. He also served as an advisor to the U.S. delegation to the United Nations and as a consultant to the U.S. Air Force, which awarded him the Exceptional Service Award in 1956.

Gardner was a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and of the Educational Testing Service and a director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. He served as chairman of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Panel on Education, and was chief draftsman of that group&#x27;s widely circulated report, &quot;The Pursuit of Excellence&quot;.

Gardner authored books on improving leadership in American society and other subjects. He was also the founder of two prestigious fellowship programs, The White House Fellows and The John Gardner Fellowship at Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. In 1966 Gardner was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.

== Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) ==
Gardner&#x27;s term as Secretary of HEW was at the height of Johnson&#x27;s Great Society domestic agenda. During this tenure, the department undertook both the huge task of launching Medicare, which brought quality health care to senior citizens, and oversaw significant expansions of the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 that redefined the federal role in education and targeted funding to poor students. Gardner resigned as head of HEW because he could not support the war in Vietnam.

Gardner was featured on the cover and in an article of the January 20, 1967 &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and later that year also presided over the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

== Later life ==
Gardner later served on the Stanford University Board of Trustees from 1968 to 1982. On August 18, 1970, Gardner founded Common Cause, and also founded the Experience Corps in the same year.

In 1973, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1980–1983 he co-founded Independent Sector, which lobbies and does public relations work on behalf of tax-exempt organizations in order to retain the charitable deduction.

In September 2000, Gardner lent his name and support to the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities at Stanford University, a center that partners with communities to develop leadership, conduct research, and effect change to improve the lives of youth.

Gardner died of cancer in San Francisco on February 16, 2002. He was buried in San Francisco National Cemetery.

==The John Gardner Fellowship Program==
The John Gardner Fellowship Program was established in 1985 by Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley to honor Gardner. The fellowship encourages highly motivated graduating seniors to pursue careers in public and community service. Three fellows from each university are chosen annually and provided with placement assistance and a senior mentor in their placement organization. Past placements have included the White House, the United States Department of State, and various nonprofit organizations.

Initial funding for the fellowship was provided by the Walter and Elise Haas Fund, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Educational Foundation of America, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the UC Berkeley Chancellor&#x27;s Millennium Fund, and Michael Walsh. Over time, additional supporters have contributed to the program.

The John Gardner Fellowship Association is an association of John Gardner Fellowship alumni from both Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, whose mission is to carry on Gardner&#x27;s legacy of public service and ensure that the Fellowship programs at both schools have adequate resources for success.

Notable former fellows include Gary Rosen, editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s Weekend Review (1988–1989), Rachel Maddow (1994–1995), and Heather Podesta (1993–1994).

<doc id="1123369" wikidata="Q62072405" url="?curid=1123369" title="Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire">
<text>The causes and mechanisms of the fall of the Western Roman Empire are a historical theme that was introduced by historian Edward Gibbon in his 1776 book &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. Though Gibbon was not the first to speculate on why the empire collapsed, he was the first to give a well-researched and well-referenced account of the event, and started an ongoing historiographical discussion about what caused the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The traditional date for the end of the Western Roman Empire is 476 when the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed. Many theories of causality have been explored. In 1984, Alexander Demandt enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell, and new theories have since emerged. Gibbon himself explored ideas of internal decline (civil wars, the disintegration of political, economic, military, and other social institutions) and of attacks from outside the empire. 

Many historians have postulated reasons for the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Their conclusions usually belong in two broad schools: (1) external factors, such as military threats and barbarian invasions or (2) internal factors, such as a decline in &quot;civic virtue&quot; and military and economic capability. Most historians believe that the fall was due to a combination of both internal and external factors, but come down more heavily on one or the other as the most important cause of the fall. Modern scholarship has introduced additional factors such as climate change, epidemic diseases, and environmental degradation as important reasons for the decline. Some historians have postulated that the Roman Empire did not fall at all, but that the &quot;decline&quot; was instead a gradual, albeit often violent, transformation into the societies of the Middle Ages. 

Comparisons by historians, both professional and amateur, and in literature, both scholarly and popular, of Rome with the decline and fall of other societies have been numerous. &quot;From the eighteenth century onward&quot;, historian Glen Bowersock wrote, &quot;we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears.&quot;

==Overview of historiography==
Historiographically, the primary issue historians have looked at when analyzing any theory is the continued existence of the Eastern Empire or Byzantine Empire, which lasted almost a thousand years after the fall of the west. For example, Gibbon implicates Christianity in the fall of the Western Empire, yet the eastern half of the Empire, which was even more Christian than the west in geographic extent, fervor, penetration and vast numbers continued on for a thousand years afterwards, although Gibbon did not consider the Eastern Empire to be much of a success. As another example, environmental or weather changes affected the east as much as the west, yet the east did not fall.

Theories will sometimes reflect the particular concerns that historians might have on cultural, political, or economic trends in their own times. Gibbon&#x27;s criticism of Christianity reflects the values of the Enlightenment; his ideas on the decline in martial vigor could have been interpreted by some as a warning to the growing British Empire. In the 19th century, socialist and anti-socialist theorists tended to blame decadence and other political problems. More recently, environmental concerns have become popular, with deforestation and soil erosion proposed as major factors, and destabilizing population decreases due to epidemics such as early cases of bubonic plague and malaria also cited. Global climate changes of 535–536, perhaps caused by the possible eruption of Krakatoa in 535, as mentioned by David Keys and others, is another example. Ideas about transformation without a distinct fall mirror the rise of the postmodern tradition, which rejects periodization concepts (see metanarrative). What is not new are attempts to diagnose Rome&#x27;s particular problems; already in the early 2nd century, at the height of Roman power, Juvenal in his Satire X criticized the people&#x27;s obsession with &quot;bread and circuses&quot;.

One of the primary reasons for the vast number of theories is the notable lack of surviving evidence from the 4th and 5th centuries. For example, there are so few records of an economic nature that it is difficult to arrive at even a generalization of the economic conditions. As a result, historians must use inductive reasoning in addition to available evidence to imagine how things most probably happened or must use evidence from previous and later periods. As in any field where available evidence is sparse, this ability of historians to imagine the 4th and 5th centuries plays as important a part in shaping our understanding as the available evidence, which means that there is room for endless variety in interpretation.

The end of the Western Roman Empire traditionally has been seen by historians to mark the end of the Ancient Era and beginning of the Middle Ages. More recent schools of history, such as Late Antiquity, offer a more nuanced view from the traditional historical narrative. There is no consensus on a date for the start of Rome&#x27;s decline. Gibbon started his account in 98. The year 376 is taken as pivotal by many modern historians. In that year there was an unmanageable influx of Goths and other Barbarians into the Balkan provinces, and the situation of the Western Empire generally worsened thereafter, despite incomplete and temporary recoveries. Significant events include the Battle of Adrianople in 378, the death of Theodosius I in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the Rhine in 406 by Germanic tribes, the execution of Stilicho in 408, the sack of Rome in 410, the death of Constantius III in 421, the death of Aetius in 454, and the second sack of Rome in 455, with the death of Majorian in 461 marking the end of the last opportunity for recovery.

Gibbon took 4 September 476 as a convenient marker for the final dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, when Romulus Augustus, the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, was deposed by Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain. Some modern historians question the significance of the events of the year 476 for the end of the western empire. Julius Nepos, the Western emperor recognized by the Eastern Roman Empire, continued to rule in Dalmatia, until he was assassinated in 480. The Ostrogothic rulers of Italia considered themselves upholders of the direct line of Roman tradition, and the Eastern emperors considered themselves the sole rightful Roman rulers of a united empire. Roman cultural traditions continued throughout the territory of the Western Empire, and a recent school of interpretation argues that the great political changes can more accurately be described as a complex cultural transformation rather than a fall.

==Overview of events==

The decline of the Roman Empire is one of the traditional markers of the end of Classical Antiquity and the beginning of the European Middle Ages. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire&#x27;s territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the Migration period. Although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for several centuries (until the Muslim conquests), the Empire as a whole had initiated major cultural and political transformations since the Crisis of the Third Century, with the shift towards a more openly autocratic and ritualized form of government, the adoption of Christianity as the state religion, and a general rejection of the traditions and values of Classical Antiquity. While traditional historiography emphasized this break with Antiquity by using the term &quot;Byzantine Empire&quot; instead of Roman Empire, recent schools of history offer a more nuanced view, seeing mostly continuity rather than a sharp break. The Empire of Late Antiquity already looked very different from classical Rome.

The Roman Empire emerged from the Roman Republic when Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar transformed it from a republic into a monarchy. Rome reached its zenith in the 2nd century, then fortunes slowly declined (with many revivals and restorations along the way). The reasons for the decline of the Empire are still debated today, and are likely multiple. Historians infer that the population appears to have diminished in many provinces—especially western Europe—from the diminishing size of fortifications built to protect the cities from barbarian incursions from the 3rd century on. Some historians even have suggested that parts of the periphery were no longer inhabited because these fortifications were restricted to the center of the city only. Tree rings suggest &quot;distinct drying&quot; beginning in 250.

By the late 3rd century, the city of Rome no longer served as an effective capital for the Emperor and various cities were used as new administrative capitals. Successive emperors, starting with Constantine, privileged the eastern city of Byzantium, which he had entirely rebuilt after a siege. Later renamed Constantinople, and protected by formidable walls in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, it was to become the largest and most powerful city of Christian Europe in the Early Middle Ages. Since the Crisis of the Third Century, the Empire was intermittently ruled by more than one emperor at once (usually two), presiding over different regions. At first a haphazard form of power sharing, this eventually settled on an east–west administrative division between the Western Roman Empire (centered on Rome, but now usually presided from other seats of power such as Trier, Milan, and especially Ravenna), and the Eastern Roman Empire (with its capital initially in Nicomedia, and later Constantinople). The Latin-speaking west, under dreadful demographic crisis, and the wealthier Greek-speaking east, also began to diverge politically and culturally. Although this was a gradual process, still incomplete when Italy came under the rule of barbarian chieftains in the last quarter of the 5th century, it deepened further afterward, and had lasting consequences for the medieval history of Europe.

Throughout the 5th century, Western emperors were usually figureheads, while the Eastern emperors maintained more independence. For most of the time, the actual rulers in the West were military strongmen who took the titles of &quot;magister militum&quot;, patrician, or both, such as Stilicho, Aetius, and Ricimer. Although Rome was no longer the capital in the West, it remained the West&#x27;s largest city and its economic center. But the city was sacked by rebellious Visigoths in 410 and by the Vandals in 455, events that shocked contemporaries and signaled the disintegration of Roman authority. Saint Augustine wrote &quot;The City of God&quot; partly as an answer to critics who blamed the sack of Rome by the Visigoths on the abandonment of the traditional pagan religions.

In June 474, Julius Nepos became Western Emperor but in the next year the &quot;magister militum&quot; Orestes revolted and made his son Romulus Augustus emperor. Romulus, however, was not recognized by the Eastern Emperor Zeno and so was technically an usurper, Nepos still being the legal Western Emperor. Nevertheless, Romulus Augustus is often known as the last Western Roman Emperor. In 476, after being refused lands in Italy, Orestes&#x27; Germanic mercenaries under the leadership of the chieftain Odoacer captured and executed Orestes and took Ravenna, the Western Roman capital at the time, deposing Romulus Augustus. The whole of Italy was quickly conquered, and Odoacer was granted the title of patrician by Zeno, effectively recognizing his rule in the name of the Eastern Empire. Odoacer returned the Imperial insignia to Constantinople and ruled as King in Italy. Following Nepos&#x27; death Theodoric the Great, King of the Ostrogoths, conquered Italy with Zeno&#x27;s approval.

Meanwhile, much of the rest of the Western provinces were conquered by waves of Germanic invasions, most of them being disconnected politically from the East altogether and continuing a slow decline. Although Roman political authority in the West was lost, Roman culture would last in most parts of the former Western provinces into the 6th century and beyond.

The first invasions disrupted the West to some degree, but it was the Gothic War launched by the Eastern Emperor Justinian in the 6th century, and meant to reunite the Empire, that eventually caused the most damage to Italy, as well as straining the Eastern Empire militarily. Following these wars, Rome and other Italian cities would fall into severe decline (Rome itself was almost completely abandoned). Another blow came with the Persian invasion of the East in the 7th century, immediately followed by the Muslim conquests, especially of Egypt, which curtailed much of the key trade in the Mediterranean on which Europe depended.

The Empire was to live on in the East for many centuries, and enjoy periods of recovery and cultural brilliance, but its size would remain a fraction of what it had been in classical times. It became an essentially regional power, centered on Greece and Anatolia. Modern historians tend to prefer the term &quot;Byzantine Empire&quot; for the eastern, medieval stage of the Roman Empire.

===Highlights===

The decline of the Western Roman Empire was a process spanning many centuries; there is no consensus when it might have begun but many dates and time lines have been proposed by historians.
;3rd century:
* The Crisis of the Third Century (234–284), a period of political instability.
* The reign of Emperor Diocletian (284–305), who attempted substantial political and economic reforms, many of which would remain in force in the following centuries.

;4th century:
* The reign of Constantine I (306–337), who built the new eastern capital of Constantinople and converted to Christianity, legalizing and even favoring to some extent this religion. All Roman emperors after Constantine, except for Julian, would be Christians.
* The first war with the Visigoths (376–382), culminating in the Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378), in which a large Roman army was defeated by the Visigoths, and Emperor Valens was killed. The Visigoths, fleeing a migration of the Huns, had been allowed to settle within the borders of the Empire by Valens, but were mistreated by the local Roman administrators, and rebelled.
* The reign of Theodosius I (379–395), last emperor to reunite under his authority the western and eastern halves of the Empire. Theodosius continued and intensified the policies against paganism of his predecessors, eventually outlawing it, and making Nicaean Christianity the state religion.

;5th century:
* The Crossing of the Rhine: on 31 December 406 (or 405, according to some historians), a mixed band of Vandals, Suebi and Alans crossed the frozen river Rhine at Moguntiacum (modern Mainz), and began to ravage Gaul. Some moved on to the regions of Hispania and Africa. The Empire would never regain control over most of these lands.
* The second war with the Visigoths, led by king Alaric, in which they raided Greece, and then invaded Italy, culminating in the sack of Rome (410). The Visigoths eventually left Italy and founded the Visigothic Kingdom in southern Gaul and Hispania.
* The rise of the Hunnic Empire under Attila and Bleda (434–453), who raided the Balkans, Gaul, and Italy, threatening both Constantinople and Rome.
* The second sack of Rome, this time by the Vandals (455).
* Failed counterstrikes against the Vandals (461–468). The Western Emperor Majorian planned a naval campaign against the Vandals to reconquer northern Africa in 461, but word of the preparations got out to the Vandals, who took the Roman fleet by surprise and destroyed it. A second naval expedition against the Vandals, sent by Emperors Leo I and Anthemius, was defeated at Cape Bon in 468.

* Deposition of the last Western Emperors, Julius Nepos and Romulus Augustus (475–480). Julius Nepos, who had been nominated by the Eastern Emperor Zeno, was deposed by the rebelled &quot;magister militum&quot; Orestes, who installed his own son Romulus in the imperial throne. Both Zeno and his rival Basiliscus, in the East, continued to regard Julius Nepos, who fled to Dalmatia, as the legitimate Western Emperor, and Romulus as an usurper. Shortly after, Odoacer, &quot;magister militum&quot; appointed by Julius, invaded Italy, defeated Orestes, and deposed Romulus Augustus on 4 September 476. Odoacer then proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and asked the Eastern Emperor Zeno to become formal Emperor of both empires, and in so doing legalize Odoacer&#x27;s own position as Imperial viceroy of Italy. Zeno did so, setting aside the claims of Nepos, who was murdered by his own soldiers in 480.
* Foundation of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy (493). Concerned with the success and popularity of Odoacer, Zeno started a campaign against him, at first with words, then by inciting the Ostrogoths to take back Italy from him. They did as much, but then founded an independent kingdom of their own, under the rule of king Theodoric. Italy and the entire West were lost to the Empire.

==Theories and explanations of the fall==
The various theories and explanations of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West can be very broadly classified into four groups, although this classification is not without overlap and does not imply four schools of thought or often more than a superficially similar result of often very different historical analyses:

* Decay due to general malaise
* Monocausal decay
* Catastrophic collapse
* Transformation

Explanations attributing the decay to general malaise go back to Edward Gibbon, who argued that the edifice of the Roman Empire had been built on unsound foundations to begin with. According to Gibbon, the fall was – in the final analysis – inevitable. On the other hand, Gibbon had assigned a major portion of the responsibility for the decay to the influence of Christianity, and he is therefore often, though perhaps unjustly, seen as the first proponent of a monocausal explanation.

On the other hand, proponents of a catastrophic collapse are convinced that the fall of the empire was not a pre-determined event and should not be taken for granted. Instead, they are convinced it was due to the combined effect of a number of adverse processes, many of them set in motion by the migration of peoples of the time, and that these processes together applied too much stress on the empire&#x27;s basically sound structure.

Finally, proponents of transformation as the cause challenge the whole notion of the &#x27;fall&#x27; of the empire and distinguish between the fall into disuse of a particular political dispensation, which was in any case unworkable towards its end, and the fate of the Roman civilisation at the basis of the empire. These explanations are similar enough in reasoning to be considered a school of thought and draw their basic premise from the Pirenne thesis that the Roman world underwent a gradual (though often violent) series of transformations in morphing into the medieval world. The historians belonging to this school often prefer to speak of late antiquity instead of the fall of the Roman Empire.

===Decay owing to general malaise===

====Edward Gibbon====
In the words of classicist James J. O&#x27;Donnell, the &quot;long, long shadow&quot; of Edward Gibbon &quot;darkens our understanding of the Roman world.&quot; Gibbon said the fall of Rome was &quot;the triumph of barbarism and religion.&quot; In &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1776–89), Gibbon dated the beginning of the decline of Rome to the year 180 after the death of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. The &quot;long peace&quot; that ended with Marcus, in his view, &quot;introduced a slow and secret poison into the vitals of the empire...The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.&quot; Weakened by internal decay, the Western Roman Empire &quot;was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.&quot;

===Underlying causes===
When Gibbon published his landmark work, it quickly became the standard, and remained so for over 200 years. Peter Brown has written that &quot;Gibbon&#x27;s work formed the peak of a century of scholarship which had been conducted in the belief that the study of the declining Roman Empire was also the study of the origins of modern Europe&quot;. Gibbon was the first to attempt an explanation of causes of a Fall of empire. Historian Gerald J. Gruman explains Gibbon&#x27;s views as built around two important concepts: &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;excess&quot;. Gibbon&#x27;s interpretation of the causes of the decline and fall of the Roman empire are primarily political and can be grouped under four political headings: universal domination, democracy, militarism and religion.

====Universal domination====
Gibbon assumes the best course for all nations is to preserve a balance of power between them. Without balance, humans produce domination, or its opposite excess, submergence. Rome&#x27;s pursuit of empire led to its own demise, because such domination is &quot;artificial and abnormal&quot;. Gibbon thought that, in its quest for world dominion, Rome had created a situation that intensified the evils of despotism, lost public freedom, and allowed the universal dominion of their &quot;Pax Romana&quot; to cause the deterioration of the political virtues. The Roman Empire included many different nations and cultures, and Rome pushed assimilation by offering citizenship in what Gibbon saw as a profligate manner. The citizens of the Roman world-empire &quot;received the name without adopting the spirit of Romans&quot;. This led to what Gibbon saw as an obliteration of what it meant to be Roman.

====Democracy====
Gibbon admired the Roman aristocracy, and believed democracy led to anarchy and instability. He condemned Roman imperialism because it reduced nations to a mediocre uniformity, levelling all classes and individuals to a servile equality. What followed democracy&#x27;s inevitable collapse was despotism. Gibbon accused despotism of weakening the military virtues (I, 194 and II, 522), of causing excessive taxation (II, 190), of fettering the mind (I, 58), and of producing other consequences fatal to the health of the empire.

====Militarism====
Like democracy and universal domination, militarism was considered by Gibbon to be one of the major causes of the decline and fall. To Gibbon, a standing army was a threatening element. So were individual soldiers. Gibbon explains, with irony, that the enrollment of barbarian troops accelerated the trend toward the &quot;perversion&quot; of pacifism in the broader society. The hiring of mercenary troops imposed a ruinous financial burden (I, 136), and the quality of those troops deteriorated. Successive generations of the governing class &quot;experienced a failure of nerve, a loss of virtue, and so abdicated to successive groups of non-Romans the role of defending Rome&quot;. For Gibbon, that meant &quot;the last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished&quot; (III, 130).

====Religion====
Gibbon believed that the adoption of Christianity as the religion of Rome in the fourth century was an important factor in the fall of the Empire. He said that Christianity &quot;preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of the military spirit were buried in the cloister.&quot; The Church caused the diversion of money and manpower away from the needs of the Empire. Gibbon was criticized for his linkage of the rise of Christianity with the decline of Rome. Gibbon&#x27;s treatment of Christianity retains its place in political categorization as Gibbon characterized the Christian community of Antiquity as a polity even during its period of persecution. According to Clifford Ando, &quot;Gibbon identifies three causes of the empire&#x27;s decline and excuses two more. The two factors absolved are the barbarians and Christianity&quot;. This is because Gibbon saw empire as already advanced in decline before either of these became a factor. Christianity typified superstition in Gibbon&#x27;s view, and its spirituality was subversive of the traditional Roman virtues (IV, 162), but monks and eunuchs were not agents of social change so much as they were symptoms of a decline already taking place.

====Vegetius on military decline====
Writing in the 5th century, the Roman historian Vegetius pleaded for reform of what must have been a greatly weakened army. The historian Arther Ferrill has suggested that the Roman Empire – particularly the military – declined largely as a result of an influx of Germanic mercenaries into the ranks of the legions. This &quot;Germanization&quot; and the resultant cultural dilution or &quot;barbarization&quot; led not only to a decline in the standard of drill and overall military preparedness within the Empire, but also to a decline of loyalty to the Roman government in favor of loyalty to commanders. Ferrill agrees with other Roman historians such as A.H.M. Jones:
====Michael Rostovtzeff, Ludwig von Mises, and Bruce Bartlett: excessive government====
Historian Michael Rostovtzeff and economist Ludwig von Mises both argued that unsound economic policies played a key role in the impoverishment and decay of the Roman Empire. According to them, in the second and third century, the Roman Empire developed a complex market economy in which trade was relatively free. Using Marxist terms, Rostovtzeff in 1926 argued that the roots of Roman decline were the &quot;alliance of the [regressive] elements of the rural proletariat with the military destroyed the beneficient rule of an urban bourgeoisie.&quot; Mises in 1959 said the ruin of Rome was due to inflation and government intervention in the economy, especially with price controls that did not reflect market realities. Bruce Bartlett followed in the footsteps of Rostovtzeff and Mises. He titled his 1994 essay, &quot;How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome.&quot; He said that &quot;the fall of Rome was fundamentally due to economic deterioration resulting from excessive taxation, inflation, and over-regulation.&quot;

====Joseph Tainter: diminishing returns====
In his 1988 book &quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies&quot;, American anthropologist Tainter presents the view that for given technological levels there are implicit declining returns to complexity, in which systems deplete their resource base beyond levels that are ultimately sustainable. Tainter argues that societies become more complex as they try to solve problems. Social complexity can include differentiated social and economic roles, reliance on symbolic and abstract communication, and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial &quot;energy&quot; subsidy (meaning resources, or other forms of wealth). When a society confronts a &quot;problem&quot;, such as a shortage of or difficulty in gaining access to energy, it tends to create new layers of bureaucracy, infrastructure, or social class to address the challenge.

For example, as Roman agricultural output slowly declined and population increased, per-capita energy availability dropped. The Romans solved this problem in the short term by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses (metals, grain, slaves, etc.). However, this solution merely exacerbated the issue over the long term; as the Empire grew, the cost of maintaining communications, garrisons, civil government, etc., increased. Eventually, this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory. At that point, the Empire fragmented into smaller units.

Though it&#x27;s often presumed that the collapse of the Roman Empire was a catastrophe for everyone involved, Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were better off (all but the elite, presumably). Archeological evidence from human bones indicates that average nutrition improved after the collapse in many parts of the former Roman Empire. Average individuals may have benefited because they no longer had to invest in the burdensome complexity of empire. Tainter&#x27;s view is supported by later studies which indicate that European men in the medieval period were taller than those of the Roman Empire. Average stature is a good indicator of nutrition and health. 

In Tainter&#x27;s view, while invasions, crop failures, disease or environmental degradation may be the &quot;apparent&quot; causes of societal collapse, the ultimate cause is &quot;diminishing returns on investments in social complexity&quot;.

====Adrian Goldsworthy====
In &quot;The Complete Roman Army&quot; (2003) Adrian Goldsworthy, a British military historian, sees the causes of the collapse of the Roman Empire not in any &#x27;decadence&#x27; in the make-up of the Roman legions, but in a combination of endless civil wars between factions of the Roman Army fighting for control of the Empire. This inevitably weakened the army and the society upon which it depended, making it less able to defend itself against the growing numbers of Rome&#x27;s enemies. The army still remained a superior fighting instrument to its opponents, both civilized and barbarian; this is shown in the victories over Germanic tribes at the Battle of Strasbourg (357) and in its ability to hold the line against the Sassanid Persians throughout the 4th century. But, says Goldsworthy, &quot;Weakening central authority, social and economic problems and, most of all, the continuing grind of civil wars eroded the political capacity to maintain the army at this level.&quot; Goldsworthy set out in greater detail his theory that recurring civil wars during the late fourth and early fifth centuries contributed to the fall of the West Roman Empire (395–476), in his book &quot;The Fall of the West: The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower&quot; (2009).

===Monocausal decay===

====Disease====
William H. McNeill, a world historian, noted in chapter three of his book &quot;Plagues and Peoples&quot; (1976) that the Roman Empire suffered the severe and protracted Antonine Plague starting around 165. For about twenty years, waves of one or more diseases, possibly the first epidemics of smallpox and measles, swept through the Empire, ultimately killing about half the population. Similar epidemics, such as the Plague of Cyprian, also occurred in the 3rd century. McNeill argues that the severe fall in population left the state apparatus and army too large for the population to support, leading to further economic and social decline that eventually killed the Western Empire. The Eastern half survived due to its larger population, which even after the plagues was sufficient for an effective state apparatus.

Archaeology has revealed that from the 2nd century onward, the inhabited area in most Roman towns and cities grew smaller and smaller. Imperial laws concerning &quot;agri deserti&quot;, or deserted lands, became increasingly common and desperate. The economic collapse of the 3rd century may also be evidence of a shrinking population as Rome&#x27;s tax base was also shrinking and could no longer support the Roman Army and other Roman institutions.

Rome&#x27;s success had led to increased contact with Asia though trade, especially in a sea route through the Red Sea that Rome cleared of pirates shortly after conquering Egypt. Wars also increased contact with Asia, particularly wars with the Persian Empire. With increased contact with Asia came increased transmission of disease into the Mediterranean from Asia. Romans used public fountains, public latrines, public baths, and supported many brothels all of which were conducive to the spread of pathogens. Romans crowded into walled cities and the poor and the slaves lived in very close quarters with each other. Epidemics began sweeping though the Empire.

The culture of the German barbarians living just across the Rhine and Danube rivers was not so conducive to the spread of pathogens. Germans lived in small scattered villages that did not support the same level of trade as did Roman settlements. Germans lived in single-family detached houses. Germans did not have public baths nor as many brothels and drank ale made with boiled water. The barbarian population seemed to be on the rise. The demographics of Europe were changing.

Economically, depopulation led to the impoverishment of East and West as economic ties among different parts of the empire weakened. Increasing raids by barbarians further strained the economy and further reduced the population, mostly in the West. In areas near the Rhine and Danube frontiers, raids by barbarians killed Romans and disrupted commerce. Raids also forced Romans into walled towns and cities furthering the spread of pathogens and increasing the rate of depopulation in the West. A low population and weak economy forced Rome to use barbarians in the Roman Army to defend against other barbarians.

====Environmental degradation====
Another theory is that gradual environmental degradation caused population and economic decline. Deforestation and excessive grazing led to erosion of meadows and cropland. Increased irrigation without suitable drainage caused salinization, especially in North Africa. These human activities resulted in fertile land becoming nonproductive and eventually increased desertification in some regions. Many animal species became extinct. The recent research of Tainter stated that &quot;deforestation did not cause the Roman collapse&quot;, although it could be a minor contributing factor.

Also, high taxes and heavy slavery are another reason for decline, as they forced small farmers out of business and into the cities, which became overpopulated. Roman cities were only designed to hold a certain number of people, and once they passed that, disease, water shortage and food shortage became common.

====Lead poisoning====

Publishing several articles in the 1960s, the sociologist S. Colum Gilfillan advanced the argument that lead poisoning was a significant factor in the decline of the Roman Empire. Later, a posthumously published book elaborated on Gilfillan&#x27;s work on this topic. Jerome Nriagu, a geochemist, argued in a 1983 book that &quot;lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire.&quot; His work centred on the level to which the ancient Romans, who had few sweeteners besides honey, would boil must in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called &quot;defrutum&quot;, concentrated again into &quot;sapa&quot;. This syrup was used to some degree to sweeten wine and food. If acidic must is boiled within lead vessels the sweet syrup it yields will contain a quantity of Pb(C2H3O2)2 or lead(II) acetate. Lead was also leached from the glazes on amphorae and other pottery, from pewter drinking vessels and cookware, and from lead piping used for municipal water supplies and baths.

The role and importance of lead poisoning in contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire is the subject of controversy, and its importance and validity is discounted by many historians. John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, criticized Nriagu&#x27;s book as &quot;so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments.&quot; He concluded that ancient authorities were well aware of lead poisoning and that it was not endemic in the Roman empire nor did it cause its fall.

===Catastrophic collapse===

====J. B. Bury====
J. B. Bury&#x27;s &quot;History of the Later Roman Empire&quot; (1889/1923) challenged the prevailing &quot;theory of moral decay&quot; established by Gibbon as well as the classic &quot;clash of Christianity vs. paganism&quot; theory, citing the relative success of the Eastern Empire, which was resolutely Christian. He held that Gibbon&#x27;s grand history, though epoch-making in its research and detail, was too monocausal. His main difference from Gibbon lay in his interpretation of facts, rather than disputing any facts. He made it clear that he felt that Gibbon&#x27;s thesis concerning &quot;moral decay&quot; was viablebut incomplete. Bury&#x27;s judgment was that:

Bury held that a number of crises arose simultaneously: economic decline, Germanic expansion, depopulation of Italy, dependency on Germanic &quot;foederati&quot; for the military, the disastrous (though Bury believed unknowing) treason of Stilicho, loss of martial vigor, Aetius&#x27; murder, the lack of any leader to replace Aetiusa series of misfortunes which, in combination, proved catastrophic:
====Peter Heather====
Peter Heather, in his &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (2005), maintains the Roman imperial system with its sometimes violent imperial transitions and problematic communications notwithstanding, was in fairly good shape during the first, second, and part of the 3rd centuries. According to Heather, the first real indication of trouble was the emergence in Iran of the Sassanid Persian empire (226–651). In Heather&#x27;s words: 
Heather goes on to statein the tradition of Gibbon and Burythat it took the Roman Empire about half a century to cope with the Sassanid threat, which it did by stripping the western provincial towns and cities of their regional taxation income. The resulting expansion of military forces in the Middle East was finally successful in stabilizing the frontiers with the Sassanids, but the reduction of real income in the provinces of the Empire led to two trends which, Heather says, had a negative long-term impact. First, the incentive for local officials to spend their time and money in the development of local infrastructure disappeared. Public buildings from the 4th century onward tended to be much more modest and funded from central budgets, as the regional taxes had dried up. Second, Heather says &quot;the landowning provincial literati now shifted their attention to where the money was ... away from provincial and local politics to the imperial bureaucracies.&quot; Having set the scene of an Empire stretched militarily by the Sassanid threat, Heather then suggests, using archaeological evidence, that by 400 the Germanic tribes of Europe had &quot;increased substantially in size and wealth&quot; since the first century. Contact with the Empire had increased their material wealth, and that in turn had led to disparities of wealth sufficient to create ruling and military classes capable of maintaining control over far larger groupings than had previously been possible. The Germans had become more formidable foes.

Heather then posits what amounts to a domino theorynamely that pressure on peoples very far away from the Empire could result in sufficient pressure on peoples on the Empire&#x27;s borders to make them contemplate the risk of full scale immigration to the empire. Thus he links the Gothic invasion of 376 directly to Hunnic movements around the Black Sea in the decade before. In the same way he sees the invasions across the Rhine in 406 as a direct consequence of further Hunnic incursions in Germania; as such he sees the Huns as important in the fall of the Western Empire long before they themselves became a military threat to the Empire. He postulates that the Hunnic expansion caused unprecedented invasions of the Empire in 376 and 405–408 by barbarian groupings who had become significantly more politically and militarily capable than in previous eras. This detached territory and denied revenues to an empire already at maximum stretch due to the Sassanid pressure.

He disputes Gibbon&#x27;s contention that Christianity and moral decay led to the decline. He also rejects the political infighting of the Empire as a reason, considering it was a systemic recurring factor throughout the Empire&#x27;s history which, while it might have contributed to an inability to respond to the challenges of the 5th century, it cannot be blamed for them. Instead he places the fall of the Western Roman Empire on outside military factors, starting with the Sassanids, and ending with the Germanic invasions under pressure from the Huns.

====Bryan Ward-Perkins====
Bryan Ward-Perkins&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization&quot; (2005) takes a traditional view tempered by modern discoveries, arguing that the empire&#x27;s demise was caused by a vicious circle of political instability, foreign invasion, and reduced tax revenue. Essentially, invasions caused long-term damage to the provincial tax base, which lessened the Empire&#x27;s medium- to long-term ability to pay and equip the legions, with predictable results. Likewise, constant invasions encouraged provincial rebellion as self-help, further depleting Imperial resources. Contrary to the trend among some historians of the &quot;there was no fall&quot; school, who view the fall of Rome as not necessarily a &quot;bad thing&quot; for the people involved, Ward-Perkins argues that in many parts of the former Empire the archaeological record indicates that the collapse was truly a disaster.

Ward-Perkins&#x27; theory, much like Bury&#x27;s, and Heather&#x27;s, identifies a series of cyclic events that came together to cause a definite decline and fall.

===Transformation===

==== Henri Pirenne ====
In the second half of the 19th century, some historians focused on the continuities between the Roman Empire and the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms rather than the rupture. In &quot;Histoire des institutions politiques de l&#x27;ancienne France&quot; (1875–89), Fustel de Coulanges argued that the barbarians simply contributed to an ongoing process of transforming Roman institutions.

Henri Pirenne continued this idea with the &quot;Pirenne Thesis&quot;, published in the 1920s, which remains influential to this day. It holds that even after the barbarian invasions, the Roman way of doing things did not immediately change; barbarians came to Rome not to destroy it, but to take part in its benefits, and thus they tried to preserve the Roman way of life. The Pirenne Thesis regards the rise of the Frankish realm in Europe as a continuation of the Roman Empire, and thus validates the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Holy Roman Emperor as a successor of the Roman Emperors. According to Pirenne, the real break in Roman history occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries as a result of Arab expansion. Islamic conquest of the area of today&#x27;s south-eastern Turkey, Syria, Palestine, North Africa, Spain and Portugal ruptured economic ties to western Europe, cutting the region off from trade and turning it into a stagnant backwater, with wealth flowing out in the form of raw resources and nothing coming back. This began a steady decline and impoverishment so that by the time of Charlemagne western Europe had become almost entirely agrarian at a subsistence level, with no long-distance trade. Pirenne&#x27;s view on the continuity of the Roman Empire before and after the Germanic invasion has been supported by recent historians such as François Masai, Karl Ferdinand Werner, and Peter Brown.

Some modern critics have argued that the &quot;Pirenne Thesis&quot; erred on two counts: by treating the Carolingian realm as a Roman state and by overemphasizing the effect of the Islamic conquests on the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. Other critics have argued that while Pirenne was correct in arguing for the continuity of the Empire beyond the sack of Rome, the Arab conquests in the 7th century may not have disrupted Mediterranean trade routes to the degree that Pirenne argued. Michael McCormick in particular has argued that some recently unearthed sources, such as collective biographies, describe new trade routes. Moreover, other records and coins document the movement of Islamic currency into the Carolingian Empire. McCormick has concluded that if money was coming in, some type of goods must have been going out – including slaves, timber, weapons, honey, amber, and furs.

==== Lucien Musset and the clash of civilizations ====
In the spirit of &quot;Pirenne thesis&quot;, a school of thought pictured a clash of civilizations between the Roman and the Germanic world, a process taking place roughly between 3rd and 8th century.

The French historian Lucien Musset, studying the Barbarian invasions, argues the civilization of Medieval Europe emerged from a synthesis between the Graeco-Roman world and the Germanic civilizations penetrating the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire did not fall, did not decline, it just transformed but so did the Germanic populations which invaded it. To support this conclusion, beside the narrative of the events, he offers linguistic surveys of toponymy and anthroponymy, analyzes archaeological records, studies the urban and rural society, the institutions, the religion, the art, and the technology.

==== Late Antiquity ====
Historians of Late Antiquity, a field pioneered by Peter Brown, have turned away from the idea that the Roman Empire fell at all – refocusing instead on Pirenne&#x27;s thesis. They see a transformation occurring over centuries, with the roots of Medieval culture contained in Roman culture and focus on the continuities between the classical and Medieval worlds. Thus, it was a gradual process with no clear break. Brown argues in his book that:

<text>The 1999 European Grand Prix (formally the 1999 Warsteiner Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 September 1999 at the Nürburgring in Nürburg, Germany. It was the fourteenth race of the 1999 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 66-lap race was won by Johnny Herbert, driving a Stewart-Ford, with Jarno Trulli second in a Prost-Peugeot and Herbert&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello third.

It was considered to be one of the most eventful and exciting races of the 1999 season. Going into the race Mika Häkkinen, Eddie Irvine, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and David Coulthard were all harbouring World Championship aspirations. Häkkinen and Irvine were tied for the points lead, with Frentzen 10 points behind them and Coulthard a further two points back. In the previous round at Monza, Häkkinen had made an unforced error while leading, Coulthard and Irvine finished only fifth and sixth and Frentzen took his second race win of the season. 

In the race, a high number of retirements saw Marc Gené take sixth place for the Minardi team, their first points since Pedro Lamy&#x27;s at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. The Stewart cars took first and third, with Prost&#x27;s Jarno Trulli finishing second. As a consequence of the race, Häkkinen moved into the lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, two points ahead of Irvine, with Frentzen a further twelve behind. In the World Constructors Championship, McLaren extended their lead to twelve points over Ferrari. It would prove to be Johnny Herbert&#x27;s third and final F1 victory, also his seventh and final podium in what was the only victory for the Stewart Grand Prix team as well as their only double podium. It was also the first podium finish of Jarno Trulli&#x27;s F1 career, and the last podium finish for the Prost team. 

This would be the last time until the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix that both Ferraris in the race would fail to score points, and also the last time until the 2003 Australian Grand Prix that neither Ferrari driver finished on the podium.

==Report==

===Background===
Heading into the race, McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen and Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine were tied for the lead of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship on 60 points each. Jordan driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third on 50, followed by Häkkinen&#x27;s team-mate David Coulthard on 48. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren led Ferrari by six points, 108 to 102, with Jordan third on 57.

Following the Italian Grand Prix on 12 September, four teams (McLaren, Williams, Jordan, Stewart) conducted testing sessions at the Magny-Cours circuit on 14–16 September. Coulthard set the fastest time on all three days of testing. Williams, Jordan and Stewart ran for only two days at Magny-Cours. Ferrari ran their pairing Irvine and Mika Salo at the team&#x27;s test circuit of Mugello. Ferrari test driver and Minardi driver Luca Badoer performed engine development work at their test track at Fiorano with Irvine performing shakedown runs. Benetton performed aerodynamic mapping tests at RAF Kemble with Arrows and Minardi electing not to test.

===Practice and qualifying===
Two practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday from 11:00 to 14:00 local time, and a second on Saturday morning between 09:00 and 11:00. The first practice session took place in dry conditions. The ambient temperature was and the track temperature was during the hour-long period.

Saturday afternoon&#x27;s qualifying session was held from 13:00 to 14:00 local time. Each driver was limited to twelve laps with the implementation of a 107% rule to exclude slow drivers from competing in the Sunday race. The session was held on a wet track – the result of previous rainfall with isolated showers a few hours before qualifying. The ambient temperature ranged between , while the track temperature ranged between . Frentzen clinched second pole position of his career, in his Jordan 199, with a time of 1:19.910. Although he was dissatisfied with earlier problems finding the ideal setup during practice—he said that he felt fantastic to be on pole position—he believed he could have made a faster lap, as he was carrying five laps worth of fuel on board. Frentzen was joined on the front row by Coulthard who was two-tenths of a second slower.

===Race===
On race day the track was dry but the start was delayed when Alessandro Zanardi and Marc Gené lined up out of sequence on the grid, necessitating another formation lap. As the start was aborted during the start lights&#x27; sequence, the top five qualifiers and Jean Alesi actually jumped the start but were not penalised due to the aborting of the start. When the race finally got under way, Frentzen led from Häkkinen, but further back there was trouble at the first corner. Damon Hill&#x27;s Jordan suffered an electrical failure in the middle of the pack which caused Alexander Wurz to swerve into Pedro Diniz, sending the Sauber into a barrel roll. The safety car was deployed while Diniz was helped uninjured from his car – a fortunate end result as it was later revealed that the Sauber&#x27;s rollbar had failed when it hit the ground.

The race settled down with the top six Frentzen, Häkkinen, Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, Giancarlo Fisichella, and Irvine. On lap 17, Irvine passed Fisichella after pressuring the Italian into running wide at turn 8. Whilst further back Zanardi was an unfortunate victim to the collision between Diniz and Wurz as his car was damaged from this incident earlier on and would eventually retire on lap 11 when his Supertec engine stalled. Just moments later the rain began to fall and Ralf Schumacher took advantage of the damp track to pass Coulthard. At the end of lap 20, Häkkinen pitted for wet tyres, which proved to be premature as the rain quickly blew over and the track dried. The following lap Irvine pitted for dry tyres but the stop lasted 28 seconds with the right-rear mechanics seemingly confused over a last minute change in tyre choice. Team mate Mika Salo had damaged his wing the previous lap leaving the Ferrari pitcrew unprepared for Irvine. On lap 24, Häkkinen on wet tyres was lapping around seven seconds slower than the leaders and was overtaken by Irvine over the start-finish straight dropping to 13th position. Soon afterwards, with his tyres clearly overheating, Häkkinen pitted again to change back to dry tyres emerging just in front of Fisichella, who was a full lap ahead of him.

Ralf Schumacher pitted from second position at the end of lap 27 for his scheduled first stop leaving Frentzen and Coulthard battling at the front followed by Fisichella twelve seconds behind the leaders in third place. At the end of lap 32 both Frentzen and Coulthard pitted for their first scheduled stops with both Jordan and McLaren mechanics impeccably turning their cars around in seven seconds, and both returning comfortably ahead of Schumacher. At this point in the race both Irvine and Häkkinen were well out of the points, meaning that if the order stayed the same Frentzen, Irvine, and Häkkinen would have all been tied for the points lead with two races to go, with Coulthard six points behind them.

What followed was a series of retirements. The first to fall was Frentzen, who ground to a halt at the first corner after his pitstop because he had forgotten to disable the car&#x27;s anti-stall system. The team claimed it was an &quot;electrical issue&quot; in order to protect Frentzen. Coulthard inherited the lead and stayed out front until the rain came back with a vengeance. Coulthard chose to stay out on dry tyres while most pitted for wets, which ultimately proved to be a costly mistake, as he slid off the road and out of the race on the 38th lap as the conditions worsened. Within a handful of laps two Championship contenders had seen their hopes of winning the title fall by the wayside. Schumacher, still on dry tyres, then inherited the lead which he held until his pitstop six laps later. This allowed Fisichella, also on dry tyres, to take the lead with Schumacher in second, as the rain stopped. Meanwhile, Johnny Herbert had quietly moved up the order after changing to wet tyres just at the right time. Mika Salo would soon be forced to retire with brake problems.

The heartbreak then reached new levels. On lap 49, Fisichella spun out of the lead like Coulthard before him, giving the lead back to Schumacher. But then Schumacher too lost the lead when his right rear tyre punctured, allowing Herbert to take the lead which he would not lose. Further back the Minardis were taking full advantage of the unpredictable nature of the race with Luca Badoer in fourth and Gené in seventh. But with just 13 laps to go, Badoer&#x27;s gearbox failed, denying the Ferrari test driver his first ever Formula One points and leaving him in tears. Gené was promoted to sixth, which became fifth when Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s car failed with a broken clutch, robbing the BAR team of a chance to get their first-ever point before . Behind him, Irvine and Häkkinen had fought their way back into contention for points, with Irvine holding sixth ahead of Häkkinen. After cruising for most of the race, Häkkinen turned up the pressure, eventually forcing Irvine into a mistake and taking sixth place. At the front Barrichello tried to pass Jarno Trulli for second and make it a Stewart 1–2, but ultimately had to settle for third. Meanwhile, Häkkinen caught and passed Gené for fifth to earn two invaluable points, but Gené held onto sixth ahead of Irvine to give Minardi their first point in four seasons.

===Post-race===
It was the only race ever won by the Stewart Grand Prix team, as well as being the only time Stewart had two drivers finish on the podium. It was also first Grand Prix victory for a Ford-powered car since the 1994 European Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix victory for Johnny Herbert, the last podium finish for the Prost Grand Prix team and also the last-ever Formula One podium finish for the Peugeot engine, . Jackie Stewart considered the race greater than any of his own race wins. This was the final time that both Ferrari cars failed to score until the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix. This was also the last win for the Milton Keynes-based Formula One team until Sebastian Vettel won the 2009 Chinese Grand Prix in the pseudo-successor Red Bull Racing team.

Gené&#x27;s performance, in finishing sixth ahead of championship contender Irvine, is considered by many as the deciding factor in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, for it is often believed that had Irvine passed Gené for sixth, he would have had the extra point to win the title (with Michael Schumacher letting Irvine pass him during the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix.).

<text>The 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix(formally the 1999 Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix) was a Formula One race held on 17 October 1999 at the new Sepang International Circuit near Sepang, Malaysia. It was the fifteenth race of the 1999 Formula One World Championship.

The 56-lap race was won by Eddie Irvine, driving a Ferrari, after starting from second position. Teammate Michael Schumacher, in his first race back after breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix, finished second after letting Irvine overtake him, having started from pole position. Championship leader Mika Häkkinen finished third in a McLaren-Mercedes.

Both Ferraris were disqualified for the race, and Häkkinen and McLaren initially appeared to have won both championships. After Ferrari&#x27;s successful appeal, the race results were reinstated. Although the win gave Irvine a four point lead over Häkkinen in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with one race to go, it would be his fourth and last Formula One career win. 

== Report ==
This was the first Malaysian Grand Prix since a Formula Holden event in 1995, and the first time at Formula One world championship level. Michael Schumacher returned to Formula One having recovered from his broken leg, and took pole position by nearly a second from Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine, with the McLarens of David Coulthard and Mika Häkkinen third and fourth, respectively. At the start, Schumacher led away from Irvine, Coulthard, Häkkinen, and Rubens Barrichello. On lap 4, Schumacher slowed and allowed Irvine to pass him, then proceeded to block the McLarens. Coulthard forced his way past Schumacher on lap 5 and pursued Irvine for the lead, only to retire on lap 15 with fuel pressure problems.

Back in second place, Schumacher slowed again in order to allow Irvine to build an advantage. As the first round of pit stops loomed, Schumacher accelerated the pace in order to stay ahead of Häkkinen. Realising this, McLaren gambled on giving Häkkinen half a tank of fuel, hoping it would be enough to get him out of the pits ahead of Schumacher. The gamble failed, as Schumacher stayed ahead of the Finn and proceeded to block him again, allowing Irvine to extend his lead to 20 seconds.
Irvine&#x27;s lead was not big enough for him to stay ahead after his second pit stop. Despite this, Ferrari were sure that Häkkinen would have to stop again, which he did, emerging in fourth place behind Johnny Herbert in the Stewart. Schumacher slowed once again to allow Irvine to retake the lead, while Häkkinen forced his way past Herbert for third.

Irvine duly took the chequered flag one second ahead of Schumacher, with Häkkinen a further eight seconds back. Immediately after the race, the Ferraris were disqualified due to an infringement on their bargeboards. This meant that Häkkinen and McLaren were effectively handed their respective championships by default. Ferrari appealed against the FIA&#x27;s decision in court and both drivers were subsequently reinstated.

With one race remaining, Irvine led the Drivers&#x27; Championship by four points over Häkkinen, 70 to 66. Similarly, Ferrari held a four-point lead over McLaren in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, 118 to 114. Despite Schumacher&#x27;s alleged wish not have Irvine being the Ferrari driver to end the team championship&#x27;s drought, his performance in Malaysia proved instrumental for Irvine to possibly win the championship at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix.

<text>The 1999 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the XXV Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 31 October 1999 at the Suzuka International Racing Course, the sixteenth and final round of the 1999 Formula One World Championship. The 53-lap race was won by McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen after starting from second position. Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari with teammate Eddie Irvine finishing third. Häkkinen&#x27;s victory confirmed him as 1999 Drivers&#x27; Champion. Ferrari were also confirmed as Constructors&#x27; Champions.

This was the last Formula One race for Stewart Grand Prix, Toranosuke Takagi, Alessandro Zanardi and for the 1996 World Champion, Damon Hill.

== Report ==

===Championship permutations===
Going into this race, Ferrari&#x27;s Eddie Irvine led the Drivers&#x27; Championship by four points from Häkkinen, 70 to 66. Häkkinen therefore needed to win the race, or to finish second with Irvine no higher than fifth, or to finish third with Irvine finishing outside the top six.

Victory for Häkkinen would give him the Championship regardless of where Irvine finished: even if Irvine finished second, both drivers would have 76 points but Häkkinen would have five wins to Irvine&#x27;s four. Similarly, the Finn would be Champion if he finished second with Irvine fifth (as he would have three second places to Irvine&#x27;s two), or if he finished third without Irvine scoring (as he would have four third places to Irvine&#x27;s two).

===Qualifying===
Qualifying saw Irvine&#x27;s Ferrari teammate, Michael Schumacher, take pole position with Häkkinen alongside on the front row. David Coulthard was third in the second McLaren, with Heinz-Harald Frentzen fourth in the Jordan. Irvine struggled throughout, also suffering a heavy crash at the Hairpin, and could only manage fifth, over 1.5 seconds slower than Schumacher and over 1.1 slower than Häkkinen. The top ten was completed by the Prosts of Olivier Panis and Jarno Trulli, Johnny Herbert in the Stewart, Ralf Schumacher in the Williams and Jean Alesi in the Sauber.

===Race===
Häkkinen beat Schumacher off the line, with Panis charging into third ahead of Irvine, Coulthard and Frentzen. Zanardi pulled off the track into the pits in the second Williams with electrical problems on lap 1. The Finn quickly built a comfortable lead, and it became clear that the Ferraris could not match him. As Trulli in the second Prost retired when his engine failed on lap 4.

Panis retired when his alternator broke on lap 20, meanwhile Hill retired after spinning off the track but managed to come back to the pits to retire with mental driver fatigue on lap 21 in his final Grand Prix, Coulthard passed Irvine for third during the first round of pit stops. On lap 34, Coulthard made a mistake and spun into a wall, losing his nose. He pitted and rejoined a lap down, just in front of Schumacher. It was alleged that the Scot deliberately held up the German driver, before retiring several laps later with a hydraulic failure. Schumacher later criticized Coulthard&#x27;s behaviour.

Häkkinen eventually took the chequered flag five seconds ahead of Schumacher and, with it, his second Drivers&#x27; Championship. Irvine finished a minute and a half behind Schumacher in third, nonetheless helping Ferrari secure their first Constructors&#x27; Championship since . The minor points went to Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher and Alesi.

<text>World Waterpark is a water park located within the West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Opened to the public in 1986, it is the second largest indoor water park in North America after American Dream&#x27;s DreamWorks Water Park which opened on October 1, 2020. It has a maximum capacity of 5,000 guests, an average air temperature of and contains the world&#x27;s largest indoor wave pool with a capacity of 12.5 million liters.

The highest slides in the park are Twister, Sky Screamer, and Cyclone, which are all high. The park has undergone many changes over the years having gained slides, lost slides, replaced slides, and added completely new attractions. 

In 2020, World Waterpark temporarily closed for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. While some parts did temporarily close, the whole park did not close down until mid-March 2020. It reopened on July 18, 2020.

==Blue Thunder wave pool==
This wave pool has four active wave bays, each with 2 panels operated by a hydraulic system (8 total active panels). For many years, the 4 panels in the two outer wave bays have been disabled, apparently due to the waves being far too intense, resulting in injuries; guests were being thrown into each other when all 12 panels were operating, as they were in the 1980s.

Waves are generated (in 10 minutes on, 5 minutes off sessions) of approximately , utilizing only the 8 active wave panels. It is arguably the most popular attraction in the park, as many swimmers (most with inner tubes) can be found bobbing in the water. The start of every session is marked with a loud air horn blast, warning swimmers to be ready for a wave to flip them over. This air horn also sounds when the park opens or closes.

Most evenings, after regular park business hours, the Blue Thunder wave pool is used by clubs for surfing, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboarding. For these activities, the waves are often programmed for increased intensity and continuous operation.

In September 2018, the water park underwent a $2.5 million renovation including repainting the wave pool, renovated cabanas, additional bathrooms, new beach area flooring, and upgraded signage.

<doc id="1123386" wikidata="Q599048" url="?curid=1123386" title="Political consulting">
<text>Political consulting is a form of consulting that consists primarily of advising and assisting political campaigns. Although the most important role of political consultants is arguably the development and production of mass media (largely television, direct mail, and digital advertising), consultants advise campaigns on many other activities, ranging from opposition research and voter polling, to field strategy and get out the vote efforts.
==Origins==
President William McKinley&#x27;s closest political adviser Mark Hanna is sometimes described as the first political consultant. Whitaker and Baxter established the first true political consulting firm, Campaigns, Inc., which focused exclusively on political campaigns in California in the 1930s–1950s. However, political consulting blossomed with the increasing use of television advertising for campaign communications in the 1960s.

Joseph Napolitan was the first person to describe himself as a political consultant; The New York Times described him in a 1968 profile as &quot;that newest American phenomenon, the professional campaign manager&quot; and &quot;a &quot;pioneering campaign consultant&quot;&quot;. In recent years, political consulting has become more commonplace throughout the world and has extended its reach to campaigns at all levels of government. Many consultants work not only for campaigns, but also for parties and political action committees, while some focus on public relations and research work. Many consultants also take up official positions inside governments while working for an officeholder of the ruling party.

==Nature of the work==
Political consultants sometimes act as political strategists, a senior political consultant who promote the election of certain candidates or the interests of certain groups. This is achieved by planning campaign strategies, coordinating campaign staffers, and arranging events to publicize candidates or causes.

Political consultants act as public relations specialists, salespeople and managers. By using many forms of marketing-suitable media, including advertising and press releases, the general goal of political consultants is to make voters aware of their candidates&#x27; party platform.

As political consulting has expanded worldwide, journalists have noted the influence of political consulting on candidates, voters, presidents and governments of different nations. Well-known American political consultants such as James Carville, Joseph Napolitan and David H. Sayers, have traveled to other continents, acting as consultants on several political campaigns and advising heads of state. For example, Napolitan acted as a consultant of French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, several Venezuelan presidents, and Costa Rica&#x27;s Óscar Arias Sánchez, and Dick Morris &quot;has consulted for candidates in other countries of the western hemisphere, including the campaigns of Fernando de la Rua for President of Argentina, Jorge Batlle for President of Uruguay, Vicente Fox for President of Mexico, and Raphael Trotman for President of Guyana.&quot; Many Latin American political consultants have also led political campaigns outside of their native countries. One such example is Brazilian political consultant João Santana, who simultaneously led three winning presidential campaigns in Latin America: Danilo Medina, in the Dominican Republic; Hugo Chávez, in Venezuela; and José Eduardo dos Santos, in Angola, in the African continent. Venezuelan political strategist JJ Rendon (who lives in United States), has also been recognized internationally, having been ranked as one of the top five most prominent Latin American consultants by the U.S.-based publication &quot;Campaigns &amp; Elections&quot; (Latin American edition) and who was the 2014 winner of The Victory Awards for his work as the lead strategist of successful presidential campaigns of Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia (including his reelection campaign in 2014), Porfirio Lobo and Juan Orlando Hernández in Honduras and Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico, among others. João Santana has been described by the news magazine as &quot;capable of mapping out the weaknesses of adversaries with an acupuncturist&#x27;s precision.&quot; Rendon has been described by Miami New Times as the &quot;Latin America&#x27;s Karl Rove&quot;.

Notable political consultants are: David Plouffe, Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Lynton Crosby, Joel Benenson, Brad Parscale, Michael Spreng (Angela Merkel), Dominic Cummings, Anne Méaux, Michel von Tell, Alastair Campbell, Paul Manafort, Ivan Redondo, Michel Barnier, Philipp Maderthaner, Prashant Kishor.

== Criticisms ==
===Notoriety===
As political consulting has become more prevalent, consultants have become subject to increasing scrutiny and involvement in scandals as journalists have devoted considerable attention to their activities. Some successful political consultants, such as James Carville and Newt Gingrich, capitalize on their consulting fame to become professional pundits. Such political consultants routinely appear on television news programs, write books and are treated as social media celebrities.

===Conflicts of interest===
Some detractors accuse political consultants of putting their own interests and images ahead of their clients. Some consultants allege that too many consultants put their own financial interests ahead of the campaigns they are hired to serve, take on too many clients, or focus too much energy on building their own reputations.

In 2007, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted that Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards employed Harrison Hickman, a principal at Global Strategy Group, as his campaign pollster. The article described this hire as evidence of the &quot;pitfalls of hiring consultants who conduct work for corporate clients and campaigns at the same time&quot;, noting that:&quot;...Edwards&#x27;s own pollster, Harrison Hickman, is a principal at Global Strategy Group, which represents a range of corporate clients -- including oil and pharmaceutical companies -- that don&#x27;t always mesh with the candidate&#x27;s message.&quot;

===Other criticism===
Critics of the political consulting industry blame consultants for what they see as problems in the American election system.

* Consultant salaries have risen, which has increased the cost of political campaigns.
* Critics of consulting&#x27;s influence on politics say that changes to the campaign landscape have further entrenched certain consultants, regardless of their track records&quot;.
* Political consultants may be opposed to low-budget campaigns of grassroots candidates.
* Activist groups charge that political consultants are a major obstacle to participatory democracy and election reform.

==Social media in modern campaigns==
Social media has dramatically changed the way in which modern political campaigns are run. With younger and more tech-savvy citizens entering into the voting population, social media are the platforms on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the public. In years to come, social media is anticipated to overtake traditional media in terms of importance to political campaigns.

For example, in Australia 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population (according to IDEA), around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year).

The implication of this for political consulting is that social media are the channels through which an increasingly larger portion of the population receives political messages. As a consequence, unless a political consultant addresses the part of the electorate which can preferentially be reached through social media, the portion of the electorate which will be reached through traditional communication technologies will increasingly shrink in the future. For instance, social media is already the main source of information for 26% of young voters in Spain.

== Trade organizations ==
The American Association of Political Consultants is the major trade association for political consultants in the United States, with thousands of members. Like other professional organizations, it propagates a code of ethics and gives out awards. Similar organizations for political consultants exist for many other countries and regions.

<text>The 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix (officially the XXIX Grande Prêmio Marlboro do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 2000 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo, Brazil. The race, which was the second round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 29th Brazilian Grand Prix, drew 72,000 spectators. Michael Schumacher, a Ferrari driver, won the 71-lap race after starting third. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella finished second, and Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third.

McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen qualified on pole position and led the first lap of the race before being passed by World Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Michael Schumacher on lap two. Following that, Michael Schumacher built a 17.6-second lead before making the first of two pit stops for fuel and tyres on lap 20. After Häkkinen retired with a shortage of engine oil pressure ten laps later, he retook the lead. In the final 12 laps, David Coulthard in the other McLaren gained on Michael Schumacher as the latter slowed to manage an oil pressure problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season and the 37th of his career.

Following the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate. McLaren submitted an appeal with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s International Court of Appeal, which was denied. The disqualification moved every driver behind Coulthard forward by a single position. The result extended Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead atop the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 12 points. Fisichella moved from fifth to second as Rubens Barrichello in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race. Ferrari further increased their lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to 18 points as Benetton advanced from fourth to second with fifteen races remaining in the season.

==Background==

The 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix was the second of 17 races in the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 29th Brazilian Grand Prix. On 26 March. it took place at the 15-turn Autódromo José Carlos Pace in the Brazilian city of São Paulo. It was the second of six non-European Grands Prix. The high-altitude, anti-clockwise track featured significant elevation changes, putting a heavy load of g-force on the left side of drivers&#x27; necks. Teams modified their cars to run at medium to high levels of downforce and dampers, springs and suspensions were tuned to adapt to the bumpy track surface. Bridgestone, Formula One&#x27;s control tyre supplier, supplied the race with soft and medium dry compound tyres.

Following his victory in the preceding , Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with ten points, followed by teammate Rubens Barrichello with six points and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher with four points. Jacques Villeneuve of British American Racing (BAR) was fourth with three points and Giancarlo Fisichella of Benetton was fifth with two points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with a maximum of 16 points. Williams and BAR tied for third with four points each, and Benetton were fourth with four points.

Prior to the event, most the 11 teams tested their cars and new components at various locations across Europe. McLaren, Jordan, Williams, Jaguar and Prost tested at the Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom from 14 to 16 March. Luca Badoer, a Ferrari test driver, completed shakedown runs at the Fiorano Circuit in northern Italy. On the first two days of testing, McLaren test driver Olivier Panis led; on day three, Williams&#x27; Jenson Button went fastest. The BAR, Arrows, Sauber and Minardi teams did not test before the Grand Prix.

The press and bookmakers considered Michael Schumacher the favourite to win the race. In response to a statement by McLaren team principal Ron Dennis, who claimed Ferrari was not as competitive as McLaren, Schumacher expressed optimism about a continuing challenge to McLaren for the rest of the season. After faulty seals on their pneumatic valve systems forced him and two-time world champion Mika Häkkinen to retire from the preceding Australian Grand Prix, McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard predicted the team would start on the front row and win: &quot;We weren&#x27;t beaten fair and square in the race because we dropped out. You have to give Ferrari credit because they won when we dropped out and that&#x27;s our mistake. But it means we come here believing we are competitive and still have a chance.&quot;

The Autódromo José Carlos Pace was resurfaced in February to try to reduce its bumpiness. The pit lane exit was relocated from the Senna S chicane entry to the Repa Opposta straight. Following Ricardo Zonta&#x27;s crash and injury during the 1999 race, a larger run-off area was installed to the outside of Laranjinha turn, and its concrete barrier was padded with tyres. The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) technical delegate, Charlie Whiting, inspected the circuit and ordered that the pit lane barriers be moved to improve driver access. The drivers were divided about the resurfacing work. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine criticised the track&#x27;s condition. His teammate Johnny Herbert described the bumps approaching the start/finish straight as &quot;horrendous,&quot; raising concerns about a repeat of Stéphane Sarrazin&#x27;s 1999 accident. Conversely, Barrichello and his teammate Michael Schumacher said the track was better for them.

The Grand Prix featured 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) with no changes from the season entry list. Several teams modified their cars, either to refine aerodynamic appendages or to address reliability issues that arose during the Australian Grand Prix. McLaren identified an air filter failure which led to the pneumatic valve system problem in the previous race and modified its design to prevent it from reoccurring. Ford-Cosworth altered its engine lubrication system while the Arrows team altered the steering linkage design. The FIA granted Arrows permission to compete after changing the headrests design in its A21 car to protect the driver.

==Practice==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The weather was hot and clear for the Friday sessions. Barrichello led with a 1-minute, 17.631-second lap after making minor changes to his car&#x27;s aerodynamic setup before the morning session. Häkkinen, Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Villeneuve, Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi, Fisichella, Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo and Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen rounded out the top ten drivers. Alesi spun three times during the session, removing the front wing on the third. A driveshaft joint leak ended Michael Schumacher&#x27;s session ended early after eight laps and Zonta was restricted to four timed laps after debris accumulation overheated his engine. A stray dog ran onto the circuit and was knocked over by marshals in a car, interrupting practice.

Häkkinen improved his 1999 pole position lap by six-tenths of a second with three minutes remaining in the afternoon session, setting the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1 minute, 15.896 seconds. Second through tenth were Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Pedro de la Rosa&#x27;s Arrows, Alesi, Verstappen, Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Villeneuve and Fisichella. Ralf Schumacher was taken off the track twice because of a brake and balance issue. Alexander Wurz spun and beached his Benetton at Mergulho corner. Coulthard spent part of the session in the pit lane as McLaren replaced his front wing after he drove onto the grass midway through. Verstappen experimented with a tyre compound that altered his car&#x27;s setup and landed him in a gravel trap at the end of practice.

The weather remained hot and dry for Saturday&#x27;s two practice sessions. Different ride height setups were tested on teams&#x27; cars, resulting in a noticeable difference in performance. They also selected the tyre compounds for the rest of the weekend. Coulthard led the third practice session with a lap of 1 minute, 15.035 seconds, followed by his teammate Häkkinen, Ferrari teammates Michael Schumacher and Barrichello, Frentzen, Fisichella, Trulli, Irvine, Minardi&#x27;s Marc Gené and Alesi. During the session, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s team spent an hour and ten minutes changing a problematic engine. Gastón Mazzacane&#x27;s Minardi had an oil leak, limiting him to five timed laps and preventing him from participating in the final practise session later that day.

Hakkinen&#x27;s lap of 1-minute, 14.159-seconds on a new set of tyres led the fourth session, with teammate Coulthard third. Barrichello separated them. Michael Schumacher was fourth, Trulli fifth, while Fisichella was sixth, repeating his third practice result. Villeneuve, Verstappen, Ralf Schumacher and Frentzen completed the top ten. While testing a new rear wing, Barrichello spun twice, one of which was caused by a broken footrest. Frentzen and his teammate Trulli ran into a gravel trap, causing minor bodywork damage to their vehicles. Zonta lost track time due to a gearbox actuator fault and ran into a gravel trap. Button&#x27;s engine failed, laying oil on the racing line between the Laranjinha and Bico do Pato corners. Salo&#x27;s rear wing failed on the start/finish straight, causing him to spin as he braked before the Senna S chicane and hit the wall. He was unhurt.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, drivers simultaneously circulated the track. Each driver was limited to twelve laps; their fastest laps determined the race&#x27;s starting order. The 107% rule was in effect during qualifying, requiring each driver to stay within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. Heavy rain fell during the session&#x27;s final 15 minutes, making the track slippery and preventing drivers from lapping faster. A heavy wind caused a gantry-mounted cardboard advertising hoarding connected by nylon ties above the start/finish straight to detach from the fasteners and fall onto the track, forcing qualifying to be stopped three times to have them removed. Häkkinen lapped fastest with 15 minutes to go before the rain began at 1-minute, 14.111-second lap for his second consecutive and 23rd career pole position. His teammate Coulthard qualified second, with the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello third and fourth, respectively.; Schumacher understeered into the grass on his second timed lap, damaging his car&#x27;s undertray on the corrugations of a high-mounted kerb. He finished qualifying in the spare Ferrari. Because of the stoppage, Barrichello had to abandon a fast lap. Fisichella, fifth, praised his car&#x27;s handling. Irvine in sixth was happy with his Jaguar&#x27;s grip and balance.

Frentzen qualified seventh after Pedro Diniz slowed him. Zonta, eighth, focused on aerodynamic setup to improve his car&#x27;s handling. Between the final practice session and qualifying, Button switched engines and worked with race engineer Tim Preston to change his car&#x27;s setup. He was fourth early on before falling to ninth. Villeneuve qualified tenth after traffic slowed two of his timed laps and he ran onto the grass. Ralf Schumacher was the fastest driver to not qualify in the top ten after trying different spring rates but failing to improve his chassis setup. Trulli spun into a gravel trap at the Bico de Peto hairpin on his first timed lap. He returned to the pit lane to drive the spare Jordan car; an electronic control unit fault affected its gear selection, leaving him 12th. Wurz, 13th, had traffic slow all of his laps. Clutch issues put Verstappen 14th. Alesi, 15th, swerved at more than to avoid a falling advertising hoarding, damaging his car&#x27;s front wing. Alesi was unhurt. The rain slowed De La Rosa in 16th. Car setup issues put Herbert 17th. Gené in 18th ventured onto the track early in qualifying. Nick Heidfeld used the spare Prost car to secure 19th after a clutch failure in his race car. Diniz in 20th and teammate Salo in 22nd had similar rear wing failures. Mazzacane, 21st, drove the spare Minardi car after fuel pressure issues.

===Post-qualifying===
Sauber announced its withdrawal from the race during the second stoppage, citing a lack of time in Brazil to analyse and repair the structural integrity of the rear wings on both of their cars. When Sauber returned to their Hinwil headquarters, they discovered that the track&#x27;s bumpy surface had caused both of their cars to have higher-than-expected impact loads; Salo&#x27;s rear wing failed on the lower plane while Diniz&#x27;s failed on the upper plane.

===Qualifying classification===

Notes:

* Sauber withdrew Pedro Diniz and Mika Salo on the grounds of safety due to separate rear wing failures on their cars.

==Warm-up==

On Sunday morning, a 30-minute warm-up session was held in hot, overcast weather. All drivers fine-tuned their race set-ups and drove their spare cars. Häkkinen set the session&#x27;s fastest lap at 1 minute, 16.343 seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Verstappen, Ralf Schumacher, Gené, Fisichella and Zonta. Wurz&#x27;s car stalled at the exit of the pit lane ten minutes in, and the session was stopped. For the rest of the session, he drove the spare Benetton B200 car. Alesi&#x27;s engine failed, so he switched to the spare Prost AP03, which had a rear wing failure on the bumpy start/finish straight, resulting in a second stoppage.

Prost examined Alesi&#x27;s rear wing after the warm-up session and determined that its failure was caused by older bodywork parts on his car, and readied its spare chassis in case it was needed. The team said it was unconcerned about the drivers&#x27; safety and confirmed their participation in the race.

==Race==
The race began before 72,000 spectators (mostly supporting Ferrari) at 14:00 local time. At the start, the weather was hot and dry, with an ambient temperature of , a track temperature of , and a humidity of 76%. According to computer simulations, drivers who made a single pit stop had the fastest overall race times. Wurz&#x27;s engine stalled during the formation lap, delaying Alesi and Herbert; both drivers took their starting positions. Wurz began from the pit lane. Häkkinen led the field into the Senna S chicane after a brisk start from the grid. Michael Schumacher passed Coulthard for second, who had wheelspin and failed to challenge Häkkinen for the lead. Coulthard kept third after Barrichello made a slow start. Irvine overtook Fisichella for fifth place. Verstappen advanced from 14th to 11th by the end of the first lap. Button fell from 9th to 14th over the same distance. Trulli passed Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve to take tenth on the track&#x27;s inside.

As the top two approached the start/finish line, Michael Schumacher, who had been close behind Häkkinen&#x27;s heavier car throughout lap one, steered off the racing line to take the lead heading into the Senna S chicane. Barrichello slipstreamed past Coulthard for third on the start/finish straight. He then ran wide, returning Coulthard to third. By the end of lap two, Barrichello had retaken third after a gearbox fault lost Coulthard the use of the first three gears and was slower in the slow-speed corners. A malfunctioning radio prevented Coulthard from alerting McLaren to the problem, meaning he braked earlier as engine braking proved ineffective and changed his driving line. With a series of fastest laps, Michael Schumacher increased his advantage over Häkkinen to four seconds by lap 4 and to 15 seconds by lap 15 for a large enough gap for him to make an early pit stop for fuel. In the meantime, Trulli passed Zonta for eighth, Button overtook Alesi for 13th and Heidfeld lost 16th to de la Rosa. Verstappen progressed from 11th to seventh by passing Villeneuve, Zonta, Frentzen, and Fisichella as Alesi overtook Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, Zonta, and Frentzen to advance to ninth. During this time, Wurz and Heidfeld both experienced separate engine failures on laps seven and nine, while Alesi experienced an electrical failure at the Bico de Pato hairpin on lap 11.

After Häkkinen ran wide at the conclusion of lap 14, Barrichello closed up. Before the Senna S chicane, he braked, slipstreamed Häkkinen, and turned left to pass him for second at the start of the 15th lap. De la Rosa passed Herbert for 14th on that lap and Trulli overtook Irvine for fifth into the Curva do Sol turn on lap 16. That lap, Villeneuve retired with a race-long gearbox problem. The Ferrari and McLaren teams used various pit stop strategies; the Ferrari team planned for two stops in the hope that they would establish a significant enough lead over McLaren on the circuit. McLaren, conversely, planned just one pit stop because they hypothesised that the long pit lane would lose them time. When the first round of fuel and tyre pit stops began four laps later, Michael Schumacher had a 17.6 second advantage over the rest of the field. He rejoined the track in third and Barrichello led the next two laps until his stop that dropped the latter to fourth. On lap 21, Irvine lost control of his vehicle&#x27;s rear into the Bico de Pato hairpin and crashed into a tyre barrier. Six laps later, Barrichello pulled into the pit lane with smoke billowing from his car due to a hydraulic motor issue that had spread from the steering wheel to the throttle linkage. As Barrichello exited the car to retire a small fire was extinguished by his mechanics.

At the conclusion of the 28th lap, Trulli made the first of his two stops from fourth place, emerging in seventh. Before he slowed with a loss of oil engine pressure on the 30th lap, Häkkinen had pulled away to lead Michael Schumacher by 12 seconds since there was less fuel in his car. He slowed and retired in his garage. Michael Schumacher retook the lead, with the yet-to-stop Coulthard second, Verstappen third, and Fisichella fourth. Coulthard lapped to within a tenth of a second of Michael Schumacher who slowed slightly with an imbalance in all four of his tyres as Ralf Schumacher challenged Fisichella for fourth. On lap 32, Gené retired from 11th with an engine failure. Verstappen (who had conditioning issues) and his teammate de la Rosa made their first pit stops on laps 35 and 37. Four laps later, Frentzen was the first driver on a one-stop strategy to enter the pit lane earlier than scheduled because of heavy rear tyre wear losing him five seconds. Coulthard made his only stop on lap 43 and remained in second position. Michael Schumacher led by 48 seconds when he made his second pit stop on the 51st lap and retained the lead. On the same lap, Fisichella was kept on the track by his team until he made his only pit stop of the race and kept third place.

On lap 51, Herbert retired in the pit lane with a gearbox failure. Four laps later, De la Rosa lost concentration, running into a gravel trap but lost no positions. Button battled Verstappen for several laps before passing him for seventh on the 56th, as Trulli made a pit stop from fourth after his second set of tyres slowed him slightly and rejoined the track in fifth. From the 59th lap, Coulthard began to gain on Michael Schumacher, who slowed due to an oil pressure problem. He could not draw close enough to pass due to his gear selection problem, and Schumacher took his second victory of the season and the 37th of his career in a time of 1 hour, 31 minutes, 35.271 seconds, averaging over a distance of and 71 laps. Coulthard followed 4.302 seconds later and Fisichella took third. Frentzen finished fourth after driving consistently, Trulli finished fifth with a two-stop strategy that allowed him to gain places with a lightly fuelled car early in the race, and Ralf Schumacher was the final points-scorer in sixth. Button, Verstappen, de la Rosa, Zonta and Mazzacane (in his first F1 race finish) were the final finishers. The attrition rate was high; only 11 of the 20 starters finished the race.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and later spoke to the media at a press conference. Michael Schumacher, who received the winners&#x27; trophy from Brazilian footballer Pelé, said his pit stop strategy helped him to win: &quot;In the past, as you may remember, we could not overtake the McLaren entries, regardless of their strategy. Now we are looking a lot more competitive – which is where we wanted to be – and the season could hardly have started better than it has.&quot; Coulthard stated that his second-place finish gave him a start on his championship campaign following gearbox issues.: &quot;It must have been entertaining for those who had places to watch at the first corner. Given the circumstances, I am very happy with my six points.&quot; Fisichella revealed that his car understeered and oversteered for the first 15 laps until its grip and balance improved. Nonetheless, he expressed satisfaction at finishing third, &quot;This is a great result and will help us to be even more competitive in the future. I am confident about the next race when we will have some new aerodynamic parts.&quot;

Approximately one hour after the race, when the cars were subjected to post-race checks at the FIA scrutineering bay by officials, all of the top six finishers, except Fisichella, were found to have excess wear on the wooden planks attached to the floors underneath their cars, in violation of a regulation concerning illegal plank wear. The Ferrari, McLaren, Jordan, and Williams teams had a successful appeal because the bumpy racing surface caused wear from cars bottoming out. All four teams were reinstated after a second inspection caused a hour delay. During the inspection, FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer discovered that Coulthard&#x27;s front wing endplates were above the ground ( too low) rather than 50 mm (5.0 cm) above a line of reference below a car as required by the FIA regulations. Bauer determined that this gave Coulthard a competitive aerodynamic advantage and the stewards disqualified him six hours later. Adrian Newey, McLaren&#x27;s technical director, rejected the stewards&#x27; offer to transport Coulthard&#x27;s car to Paris for a fair hearing and instead agreed to a set of four measurements in São Paulo. McLaren filed an appeal, claiming that vibrations from the bumpy racing surface damaged and shifted the car&#x27;s undertray and chassis. A five-man panel heard the appeal on 4 April at a meeting of the FIA International Court of Appeal in Paris. In a 90-minute hearing, they rejected McLaren&#x27;s appeal and declared the race result final.

This promoted every driver behind Coulthard one position; Button was reclassified sixth and became the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point at the age of 20 years, 2 months, 7 days old, breaking Ricardo Rodríguez&#x27;s record from the 1962 Belgian Grand Prix. The Brazilian Grand Prix organisers were summoned to a meeting of the FIA General Assembly on 6 April. They were fined $100,000 for the track&#x27;s safety issues and the three times qualifying was stopped for falling advertising hoardings. The governing body ruled it &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; and allowed the track to remain in Formula One. The FIA&#x27;s president, Max Mosley, said that no increased fine or race cancellation were imposed because the organisers provided evidence to prevent either action from occurring, &quot;Bearing in mind that we allowed the Brazilian promoters to place the signs there – and they probably didn&#x27;t know what potential there was for the failures which occurred – it seemed only fair to impose the comparatively modest penalty.&quot;

Häkkinen limited his media interviews and left the track before the race ended. He expressed his disappointment at having to retire from the race&#x27;s lead, &quot;Nothing can describe how I feel, We have been quick all weekend, right the way through, so I am not happy to be leaving Brazil without any points. We have some work to do before the start of the European season.&quot; Button was quoted in the press as saying that he would rather score points in the race than a court of appeal, &quot;I heard the news about David as I was making my way to the airport to fly back from Brazil – and I can&#x27;t say it gave me any great feeling of joy. You want to earn any success through your driving skills, not someone else&#x27;s misfortune.&quot; Eddie Jordan, the Jordan team owner, said that both his cars finishing the event demonstrated they could last a full race distance after retiring from the Australian Grand Prix with mechanical issues. According to Frentzen, the team&#x27;s season had begun in Brazil and required maintenance to improve their performance, &quot;But we are a very strong team with a good atmosphere, I get along well with Jarno and everything is fine so far.&quot;

After the race, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by 12 points, with Fisichella moving from fifth to second after finishing second. Ralf Schumacher dropped to fourth, while Barrichello fell to third and Frentzen was fifth. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari increased its lead to 26 points, while Benetton advanced from fourth to second. Jordan&#x27;s first points of the season put them third, while Williams and BAR were fourth and fifth with 15 races remaining.

<text>The 2000 San Marino Grand Prix (formally the 20 Gran Premio Warsteiner di San Marino) was a Formula One motor race held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Emilia-Romagna, Italy on 9 April 2000. It was the third race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the season&#x27;s first European event. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 62-lap race after starting in second. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen finished second, while teammate David Coulthard finished third.

Before the race, Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship while Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Häkkinen qualified on pole position after recording the quickest lap time in the one-hour qualifying session. He led the first 44 laps before Michael Schumacher overtook him during the second round of pit stops, through a strategy devised by Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn that allowed Schumacher to run four laps longer than Häkkinen and overtook him for the race lead. Schumacher held off Häkkinen for the final 18 laps to win his third successive race and 38th overall, by 1.1 seconds.

Schumacher&#x27;s victory extended his World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead to 21 points over Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello and 22 points over Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren scored their first points of the season, moving into second place with 10 points, 29 points behind Ferrari with 14 races remaining.

== Background ==
The 2000 San Marino Grand Prix was the event&#x27;s 20th running, the third of seventeen races in the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the season&#x27;s first of eleven races in Europe. It was held on 9 April 2000 at the 17-turn, anti-clockwise Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The Grand Prix featured eleven teams of two drivers (each representing a different constructor), with no changes to the season entry list. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the soft and medium dry and wet-weather compound tyres to the race.

Before the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 20 points, followed by Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella with 8 points, and Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher with 6 apiece. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 26 points, while Benetton was second with 8 points. Jordan in third and Williams in fourth had scored 7 points each.

Several teams tested their cars, setups and components on European racing tracks for the San Marino Grand Prix. Arrows, Benetton, British American Racing (BAR), Jaguar, Jordan, McLaren, Prost and Williams tested at the Silverstone Circuit in England in mixed weather conditions from 28 to 30 March 2000. Benetton also spent a day at Santa Pod Raceway&#x27;s dragstrip, where their drivers tested a new clutch and practiced starts to determine how durable the clutch was. Ferrari&#x27;s test driver, Luca Badoer, examined mechanical components on an F399 chassis for use in the F1-2000 car and performed standing starts for four days at Ferrari&#x27;s private Fiorano Circuit. Michael Schumacher also spent three days testing car aerodynamics and setup on the track, before Badoer shookdown three F1-2000 cars for the Grand Prix on 6 April. The Minardi team did not test, instead focusing on chassis construction and establishing a research and development department.

Ferrari began the season with Michael Schumacher winning the first two Grands Prix in Australia and Brazil. McLaren, meanwhile, scored no points due to their unreliable car, and their driver David Coulthard was disqualified from second place in Brazil for a technical infringement. Despite the strong start to the season, Michael Schumacher said, &quot;Twenty points from two races is ideal, but I want to ask everybody to stay quiet. The championship has only just started and it would be wrong to believe that we&#x27;ve won it already. It&#x27;s a long season.&quot; However, improvements to his Ferrari meant he saw another victory at Imola. Coulthard felt confident in catching Ferrari and wanted to demonstrate McLaren had the fastest car, saying, &quot;They have not won the championship yet and we are not going to give it to them. We are going to fight hard all the way. We can turn things around and that is what we are going to do.&quot; Häkkinen said that his season had started slowly but he wanted to do well at Imola.

Some teams modified their cars for the Grand Prix, focusing on braking systems to cope with the Imola circuit&#x27;s demands. Ferrari used lightweight brake discs just for Saturday morning practice sessions, while Michael Schumacher drove with a new engine for qualifying only and a new rear wing specification. Sauber changed its rear wing specification following car component issues that forced the team to withdraw from the previous Brazilian Grand Prix. The Impact Protection Safety barrier system was installed along a section of tyre barrier outside the Rivazza turn for the race.

== Practice ==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. Conditions were damp and overcast at the start of the first practice due to overnight rain, but the track dried and the skies cleared, allowing lap times to gradually improve. Michael Schumacher set the session&#x27;s fastest time of 1:27.270, almost a second faster than the 1999 pole lap. Coulthard, Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, Häkkinen, Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz, Arrows&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa and Barrichello completed the top ten. Several drivers reported car problems to their teams and some competitors went off the track during the session, prompting the waving of yellow flags.

It remained dry and clear for the second practice session. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the day, 1:26.944, ahead of his teammate Barrichello. The top ten included Coulthard, Jordan&#x27;s Frenzen and Jarno Trulli, Häkkinen, Jaguar&#x27;s Johnny Herbert, Fisichella, Ralf Schumacher, and De La Rosa. Some entrants made driver errors and ended up off the track in the gravel trap. The engine in Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s BAR car failed due to a failed fuel pipeline, dropping oil over the track that he and other drivers struggled on. Jenson Button&#x27;s Williams car suffered an engine failure on the start/finish straight late in the session, and he abandoned it beside the barrier.

The first Saturday morning practice session was chilly and bright. The dry track allowed teams to finish setting up their cars for qualifying later that afternoon. Michael Schumacher led with a time of 1:25.085, followed by the McLaren duo of Häkkinen and Coulthard, Frentzen, Barrichello, Trulli, Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo, Herbert, Ralf Schumacher, and Villeneuve. Prost&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld ran into the gravel trap at the Tamburello chicane but returned to the track surface. A brake problem meant Ralf Schumacher went across a gravel trap and damaged his front wing.

The final practice session took place in warmer weather. Häkkinen set the fastest time of 1:24.973, 0.112 seconds faster than Michael Schumacher, who went sideways at the Variante Alta turn. They were ahead of Coulthard, Trulli, Frentzen, Barrichello, Salo, Villeneuve, Irvine and Diniz in positions three through ten. Ralf Schumacher abandoned his car at the side of the track with a throttle butterfly mechanism fault that forced him to switch off the engine. Marc Gené heavily damaged the front of his Minardi car against the tyre wall at Piratella corner after running wide with ten minutes left. Gené was unhurt but the heavy accident required him to go to the medical centre for checks. Villeneuve changed to a new set of tyres but drove too fast and spun into the Aqua Minerale corner gravel trap, ending his session early.

==Qualifying==
Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in bright, sunny weather, and drivers drove their cars hard, with no qualifying stoppages. Grip was low on the circuit, with cars using both soft and medium tyre compounds. Häkkinen claimed his third pole position of the season and the 24th of his career with a lap time of 1:24.714. He used soft compound tyres and a detuned engine for better reliability. Häkkinen was slower than provisional pole sitter Michael Schumacher in the first two sectors on his fastest lap set late in qualifying, and made driving errors exiting both the Variante Alta corner and the final chicane. Michael Schumacher, who was second by 0.091 seconds, veered wide leaving the left-hand Rivazza corner after unintentionally pressing the speed limiter button into the turn on his final run, losing four-tenths of a second. Coulthard qualified third but could not lap faster due to a driver error leaving the second Rivazza turn and into the last chicane. Barrichello overcame handling troubles that caused severe understeer on his Ferrari to claim fourth. Ralf Schumacher, fifth, suffered an engine issue and pulled off the track at the exit of Piratella turn with three minutes to go while he was lapping quicker. Frentzen took sixth, followed by Irvine in seventh, who on the soft compound tyres made two driver errors and slowed for yellow flags.

Trulli, eighth, reported good car balance despite slower cars on his penultimate run and yellow flags on his final run. Villeneuve took ninth on soft compound tyres after race engineer Jock Clear improved his car&#x27;s balance during qualifying, after losing four tenths of a second owing to yellow flags. Diniz, tenth, raced with greater car traction and reached sixth before other drivers lapped faster late in the session. Benetton&#x27;s Alexander Wurz took 11th due to car grip issues. Salo, 12th, hit the kerbing too hard at the final chicane, exacerbating his traction troubles. De La Rosa in 13th was satisfied with his car&#x27;s balance. BAR&#x27;s Ricardo Zonta had a new engine in his car due to motion valve issues and lacked time to find a fast way around the circuit en route to 14th. Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi experienced gear selection issues and qualified 15th. Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen took 16th due to a right-rear wheel failure on his quickest run. Herbert in 17th could not extract more performance from the medium compound tyres owing to degradation, and his exhaust was broken, draining power from the engine. Button, 18th, used the medium compound tyres for the final 15 minutes. He was unacquainted with the track following hydraulic issues earlier in the day. Button forced himself to mount the kerbs. The medium compound tyres, car setup problems, a lack of traction and handing issues left Fisichella in 19th. Minardi&#x27;s Gastón Mazzacane was the faster driver in his team in 20th. Gené in 21st, had to wait until Mazzacane finished all of his assigned laps with 15 minutes remaining before driving his teammate&#x27;s car, which was altered to suit him after the third Minardi car suffered a problem on the circuit. Heidfeld completed the starting order in 22nd, driving the spare Prost AP03 car that was setup for his teammate Alesi after his race car&#x27;s engine failed to start after a pit stop.

===Qualifying classification===
== Warm-up ==
Sunday morning&#x27;s 30-minute warm-up session took place in overcast and cool weather. As teams tested their cars and drivers reported any difficulties with them prior to the race, around one-third of participants used medium compound tyres. Häkkinen set the fastest lap at 1:27.418 late in the session, ahead of teammate Coulthard, the Ferrari duo of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello, the Jordan pair of Frentzen and Trulli, Fisichella, Gené, Irvine and Alesi. Coulthard, Gené and Mazzacane went off the track and into the gravel during the session. Halfway through warm-up, Michael Schumacher overshot his pit box and hit the mechanic holding the front jack. The mechanic was knocked down onto Schumacher&#x27;s nose cone but was unhurt.

==Race==
The Grand Prix, which began at 14:00 local time, drew between 100,000 and 120,000 spectators. The weather conditions for the race&#x27;s start were cool and overcast, with a 60% probability of rain. Heidfeld&#x27;s engine stalled and he was left stranded on the starting grid during the formation lap. His team attempted to repair the problem on the grid, but he began the race from the pit lane. When the race began, Häkkinen retained his pole position advantage to lead the rest of the field into Tamburello corner. Michael Schumacher had a poor start due to excessive wheelspin in his rear tyres. He aggressively prevented Coulthard from overtaking him on the inside, leading the pack behind him to bunch up. Coulthard had to brake into Tamburello corner, and Barrichello got alongside him, taking third place on the outside. According to &quot;Autosport&quot;, Barrichello appeared hesitant to overtake his teammate Michael Schumacher, thus he slowed early into the turn, allowing Barrichello to maintain second and preventing Coulthard from passing.

Villeneuve made a quick start, moving from ninth to fifth place. Ralf Schumacher lost momentum after putting his left-hand tyres on the grass at the Tamburello chicane&#x27;s left-hand turn to avoid hitting Coulthard due to Michael Schumacher&#x27;s blocking manoeuvre. He fell from fifth to ninth. Häkkinen led Michael Schumacher by 1.2 seconds at the end of the first lap, followed by Barrichello, Coulthard, Villeneuve, and Trulli, the latter having passed Irvine and his teammate Frentzen as the field exited the Tamburello chicane and drove onto the straight between the Tamburello and Villeneuve corners. Both Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher pulled away from the rest of the field. Mazzacane lost control of his car when braking to avoid colliding with Fisichella&#x27;s slowing car at Villeneuve turn on lap three, and marshals pushed him back onto the track because he was in a dangerous place. On lap four, Frentzen&#x27;s vehicle had a gearshift selection issue, preventing him from changing down from sixth gear. He entered the pit lane, becoming the Grand Prix&#x27;s first retirement.

On lap six, Button&#x27;s engine made odd noises and failed nearing the Villeneuve chicane, forcing him to retire in the gravel. Gené noticed Button ahead of him and drove into the gravel trap after slipping on Button&#x27;s oil on the circuit. Häkkinen set a series of fastest laps to draw 3.3 seconds ahead of Michael Schumacher by lap 22, while Barrichello and Coulthard were separated by less than a second and were distanced by the former two. Meanwhile, Verstappen made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 11 to investigate a problem with his car&#x27;s right-front wheel, and his pit team replaced the front wing. He returned to the circuit down the race order two laps later. On lap 21, Irvine accidentally pressed the speed limiter button and suddenly slowed out of Tosa turn while attempting to cure an engine misfire caused by an electrical fault, falling behind Ralf Schumacher and Salo as they crested a hill. Irvine continued driving at full speed without entering the pit lane. On lap 23, Verstappen served a ten second pit lane stop-and-go penalty for blocking faster cars. Diniz overtook Zonta for tenth on that lap.

Trulli was the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop on lap 24. His 9.3-second stop moved Ralf Schumacher to sixth. Heidfeld experienced a drop in hydraulic pressure, which became so low that his car stopped running, forcing him to retire from the race at the track&#x27;s side on that lap. When lap 25 ended, Coulthard made his first fuel stop, hoping to pass Barrichello by staying on the track for longer. He rejoined the track in seventh owing to a temporary gearbox trouble while in first gear. Alesi completed a full lap at a reduced speed due to a hydraulic pressure system fault before retiring in the pit lane. Both Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher made their first pit stops at the end of lap 27. Häkkinen retained the lead because he had less fuel put in his car than the latter, who was put on a longer second stint by Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn, allowing him to gain an advantage over Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops and to also create a lead over Häkkinen after his pit stop. Barrichello made his first pit stop on lap 28. His 7.7-second stop allowed him to rejoin the track behind the yet-to-stop Ralf Schumacher but ahead of Coulthard. Ralf Schumacher made his stop on lap 30 and fell behind Villeneuve as he exited the pit lane.

At the completion of the first round of pit stops for drivers making two pit stops, Häkkinen led Michael Schumacher by 4.5 seconds, with Barrichello 35 seconds behind in third and Coulthard close behind in fourth. Michael Schumacher was able to either equal his lap times from before his pit stop or be slightly slower until the fuel burned out, at which point he could lap quicker until his second set of tyres wore out. Behind the top four, Villeneuve, Ralf Schumacher, Salo, Irvine and Trulli were fifth to ninth. Diniz passed Zonta for tenth place, but he ran wide on the grass and Zonta reclaimed the position. On lap 39, Zonta succumbed to Diniz&#x27;s pressure and lost control of his car at the Villeneuve chicane, spinning through the gravel trap. Zonta was able to continue driving. Häkkinen ran over metal debris on the circuit, damaging the air splitter under the car and making the front of the McLaren more difficult to drive due to reduced downforce. He was able to extend his advantage over Michael Schumacher to nearly five seconds by lap 39, until the latter began to close in.

Häkkinen led Michael Schumacher by a second by lap 41. Two laps later, at the end of the main straight and braking and turning into the Tamburello chicane, Häkkinen experienced a sudden fault with his car&#x27;s electronic management computer system, which briefly shut down its Mercedes engine before the computer reset and allowed him to continue at full speed, reducing his lead over Michael Schumacher by two seconds. On the same lap, Michael Schumacher had to brake hard to avoid hitting the rear of Diniz&#x27;s car in the right-hand Acque Minerali curve when Diniz allowed Michael Schumacher to pass, losing Schumacher 1.7 seconds. Häkkinen led by 2.7 seconds when he made his second pit stop when lap 44 ended. His 8.3-second stop dropped him to second. Trulli and Irvine made their second pit stops on lap 46. Trulli passed Irvine in the pit lane because Irvine had to break to avoid a collision. Both drivers battled each other on that lap, ending in Trulli&#x27;s favour. On lap 47, Ralf Schumacher was gaining on Villeneuve when he pulled off to the side of the track to retire with a fuel supply pick-up issue.

Barrichello and Coulthard made their final pit stops on lap 47. Coulthard&#x27;s stop was faster than Barrichello&#x27;s due to the McLaren team&#x27;s quick work, and he exited just ahead of the Ferrari driver in the pit lane after Barrichello braked heavily to avoid a collision. As he was no longer in the slipstream of another car, Coulthard began pulling away from Barrichello, whose lower part of his seat belt partly broke, causing him to shift around in his cockpit, lose pace, and suffer from pain. Michael Schumacher set a sequence of fast laps on a light fuel load to try to create a potential lead after his second pit stop for fuel and tyres on lap 48, when he was 21.6 seconds ahead of Häkkinen. The stop lasted 6.2 seconds since less fuel was needed in his Ferrari, and he returned to the track in the lead, with Häkkinen 3.7 seconds behind in second. A left-rear suspension failure sent De La Rosa off the track at Acqua Minerale corner and into the barrier on lap 52. De La Rosa was unhurt.

At the front, the gap between Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher fluctuated as they lapped slower cars ahead of them, and Häkkinen set the race&#x27;s fastest lap on lap 60, a 1:26.523. Trulli went onto the grass beside the track on lap 61, becoming the Grand Prix&#x27;s final retirement because he was stuck in sixth gear. Michael Schumacher held off Häkkinen in the last laps and crossed the finish line first, claiming his third win of the season and 38th overall. Häkkinen was 1.1 seconds behind in second, and his team Coulthard was 50 seconds behind in third. Barrichello finished fourth, the last driver on the same lap as the race winner. Villeneuve came fifth, holding off Salo, who scored his and Sauber&#x27;s first championship point of the season in sixth despite losing time to the former when he was lapped by Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen. Irvine finished seventh after mid-race clutch troubles stopped him from improving his starting position. Diniz was eighth after overshooting his pit box and losing time at his pit stops. Wurz took ninth, experiencing car control issues over bumps. The one-stopping Herbert and Fisichella as well as Zonta (whose exhaust cracked), Mazzacane, Verstappen and Trulli (despite his retirement) were the final classified finishers.

=== Post-race ===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and later spoke to the media at a press conference. Michael Schumacher commended his team&#x27;s approach for helping him win the Grand Prix, saying, &quot;the strategy was just right. Those four laps were crucial – and we did it, for the tifosi.&quot; Häkkinen was disappointed to lose the victory through strategy, although he noted that running over debris on the track and his engine cutting out were also contributing factors, adding, &quot;For this reason I can say that I am extremely disappointed about the work I have been able to do this weekend, and for the work the mechanics did. Until then, everybody had done the right thing.&quot; Coulthard said that he was aware he was faster than Barrichello, whom he was close behind until the second round of pit stops, and that he hoped to be called into the pit lane one or two laps after Barrichello.

The Italian press praised Ferrari for their victory. Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo praised Michael Schumacher&#x27;s work and commended Brawn for devising the race-winning strategy, &quot;It was very tough and (Mika) Hakkinen drove very well but I am very happy with this win.&quot; He added &quot;I know where we have been and I know what we have done and this was an emotional day for the fans, we have two great drivers and the car gave a perfect performance.&quot; Barrichello expressed dissatisfaction with himself since he felt he could have finished higher, adding, &quot;I never really got on the pace this weekend and that is not good enough for me. For me, it has not been a good weekend. The settings of my car were never quite right and I felt everything was hard work. Ferrari team principal Jean Todt stated, &quot;Today&#x27;s race has shown it will be a long hard road but that is an incentive to work even harder. The drivers did a great job, as did the whole team.&quot;

McLaren team principal Ron Dennis stated that second and third place were not the anticipated results, but that they still had the capacity to win races in the remaining rounds and were looking forward to the following . Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s motorsport director Norbert Haug said McLaren&#x27;s drivers had &quot;made the best out of their situation&quot;. Haug called it &quot;a very mature performance by the whole team&quot;, adding, &quot;The harder times of having cars stranded with engine failures are considered as history. &quot;We are back in business.&quot; Villeneuve commended his team&#x27;s work during his first pit stop, which helped him move ahead of Ralf Schumacher and that &quot;the race showed that we can be competitive and maybe be the best of the rest after Ferrari and McLaren.&quot; Salo stated that he was pleased to score a point for finishing sixth and that Sauber performed similarly to their performance in Australia.

The result meant Michael Schumacher continued to lead the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with a maximum of 30 points scored. Barrichello moved from third to second with 9 points. Fisichella scored no points and dropped from second to third with 8 points. Häkkinen was fourth with 6 points and Ralf Schumacher had the same number of points in fifth. Ferrari continued to lead the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 39 points. McLaren scored their first points of the season, moving into second place with 10 points. With 14 races left in the season, Benetton (8 points) and Jordan and Williams (7 points) lost one position.

<text>The 2000 British Grand Prix (formally the LIII Foster&#x27;s British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 23 April 2000 at the Silverstone Circuit, England, United Kingdom. It was the fourth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and was the 51st time that the British Grand Prix had been included in the championship since 1950. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard won the 60-lap race after starting from fourth position. His teammate Mika Häkkinen finished second and Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher was third.

Going into the event, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship while Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Rubens Barrichello, his teammate, took pole position after setting the quickest lap time in the one-hour qualifying session. Barrichello led for the first 30 laps before failing to upshift and being passed by Coulthard on lap 31. When Coulthard made his sole pit stop two laps later, Barrichello retook the lead until he spun and retired on lap 35 with a hydraulics issue. Five laps later Coulthard regained the lead, which he held for the rest of the race. Despite gearbox problems, he finished 1.4 seconds ahead of his teammate Häkkinen. It was the second time that Coulthard had won the British Grand Prix and was the seventh victory of his F1 career.

As a result of the race, Michael Schumacher maintained his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 34 points, while Coulthard&#x27;s win moved him from eighth to second. Häkkinen&#x27;s second-place finish elevated him from fourth to third. Ferrari continued to lead the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, but their lead over McLaren was cut to 16 points with 13 races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2000 British Grand Prix, formally the LIII Foster&#x27;s British Grand Prix, was the fourth of seventeen races in the 2000 Formula One World Championship. It was held on 23 April 2000 at the Silverstone Circuit in England, United Kingdom. It was the 51st time that the race had been part of the Formula One World Championship since the 1950 Grand Prix. Eleven two-driver teams competed, each representing a different constructor, with no changes to the season entry list. Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the soft and medium dry compound tyres and the soft and hard wet-weather compounds.

Going into the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 30 points, followed by his teammate Rubens Barrichello on nine and Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella on eight. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher were tied on six points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 39 points, McLaren and Benetton were second and third with ten and eight points respectively and Jordan and Williams were tied for fourth with seven points.

Teams tested at Silverstone from 11 to 14 April to prepare for the next race. There was occasional rain during the period, making the track slippery. Barrichello was fastest on the first day, ahead of Jordan driver Jarno Trulli. Ralf Schumacher was quickest on the second day. British American Racing (BAR) driver Jacques Villeneuve hit a fox at the back of the circuit, limiting his testing time. Michael Schumacher led on the third day. Ricardo Zonta, Villeneuve&#x27;s teammate, crashed into a spectator enclosure at Stowe corner after his front-right suspension failed and suffered a cut to his right middle finger. BAR withdrew from testing because of Zonta&#x27;s accident. Michael Schumacher was fastest on the final day. Shakedown testing of the F1-2000 cars was undertaken by Ferrari on 15 April at the Fiorano Circuit in preparation for the British Grand Prix.

Michael Schumacher won the season&#x27;s first three races while Häkkinen scored only six points due to his McLaren&#x27;s unreliability. Despite his start to the season, Michael Schumacher declared he would not relax until he had won the championship and would not underestimate Häkkinen, &quot;We have the momentum, but we know how quick and lively Formula One can be. Even though Mika is behind by 24 points, it is still very early in the championship.&quot; Häkkinen stated he was frustrated not to score points in the first two races for a better championship standing but that a win at Silverstone was not necessary to secure the title, adding, &quot;But there is still a long way to go in the championship and I am not stressed about it. I believe in my team and I know my car is excellent.&quot; McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard said winning the race would mean more to him than the year before and he would focus on aiming to be as fast as possible, &quot;To get my first win of the season, and to get it at Silverstone, would be just the business.&quot;

The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) controversially moved the event from mid-July to April, when average temperatures in Britain are lower, and the race took place on Easter Sunday 2000. The need to reschedule arose following calendar congestion around July because Easter was later than usual in 2000 since that dictates the date of the held on the nearest Sunday to Ascension Day, which was later than normal, and the could not be moved because that race&#x27;s organisers had trouble finding marshals on a date close to the Rally Catalunya. The &#x27;s reinstatement, initially excluded from the calendar due to problems concerning the country&#x27;s tobacco advertising laws, and the return of the were suggested as other reasons. A general consensus was a dispute with Silverstone&#x27;s owners, the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club, and FIA vice-president Bernie Ecclestone over which track would hold the race was the reason for the move. Ecclestone said he had scheduled the for April with the British Grand Prix in July though &quot;internal politics&quot; in France had prevented the change.

A change allowing teams to use modified pit lane speed limiters was a major topic of discussion leading up to the event. The FIA permitted their use as long as they were &quot;hard-coded&quot; below , preventing teams from modifying them. The condition was imposed to prevent driver aids such as traction control and launch control from being secretly deployed, but limiters were still allowed to operate the rear light and fuel flap filler. Most drivers agreed that the change lower the risk of drivers being distracted while entering and leaving the pit lane. They did, however, voice fears that they would not drive safely at a slow speed, increasing the danger of hitting mechanics or other car.

Following Zonta&#x27;s crash, Michael Schumacher intervened, convincing the Silverstone authorities to enlarge the tyre wall at Stowe corner by one tyre in height and two in depth. Schumacher and FIA chief safety delegate Charlie Whiting ordered that the gravel trap around the area be smoothed to prevent cars becoming airborne. Some teams modified their cars for the event. Following Zonta&#x27;s accident, BAR replaced the carbon elements of their 002 car&#x27;s suspension with new steel ones. McLaren offered a revised front wing specification, as well as new screens behind the MP4/15&#x27;s front wheels. McLaren received a lighter, more powerful, and reliable version of Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s V10 engine, whereas Prost qualified and raced with the most recent version of Peugeot&#x27;s Evo 3 engine.

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions held before the Sunday race, two one-hour sessions on Friday 21 April and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday 22 April. The Friday practice sessions began on a dry track in cold weather, but after half an hour, it started to rain heavily. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen led the first session with a time of 1:27.683, almost half a second quicker than Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine. Coulthard, Häkkinen, Trulli, Villeneuve. Barrichello, Benetton&#x27;s Alexander Wurz, Fisichella and Minardi&#x27;s Marc Gené (who lost engine air valve pressure, necessitating an engine change) rounded out the session&#x27;s top ten fastest drivers. An electrical failure on Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s car prevented him from setting a lap time and he stopped at the pit lane exit. Jaguar&#x27;s Johnny Herbert was limited to three laps due to a loss of pneumatic valve pressure.

In the second practice session, Frentzen remained fastest with his lap from the previous session; the circuit was too wet for him and others to improve. Clouds of spray reduced visibility, and cars aquaplaned on standing water. Conditions on the track ranged from nearly flooded to wet during the session, as drivers attempted to optimise their cars for a possible wet-weather qualifying session the next day, though no car damage was reported. Almost halfway through the session, Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren pulled out to the edge of the tarmac surface on the Hangar Straight at the exit of Chapel corner with an hydraulic problem, necessitating a 14-minute red flag stoppage. The Land Rover recovery vehicle became stuck in mud near his car, necessitating the use of a tractor—and Villeneuve nearly struck a marshal assisting Coulthard. The stewards chose to shorten the session instead of extending it for the whole hour.

Sporting personalities criticised the Friday practice sessions being held in wet weather. Michael Schumacher stated that it was &quot;almost impossible to drive and also dangerous&quot; since he was unable to observe events ahead of him or judge the distance between himself and other cars. Coulthard believed that aquaplaning would become a serious issue and recommended that altering the wooden plank underneath the car could help alleviate the issue, &quot;It&#x27;s not comfortable for any of us, we all do it because we all want to win races but really to be going along the straight not knowing whether the car is going to stay in a straight line or not is very difficult.&quot; Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart blamed the FIA for damaging Formula One&#x27;s image by holding the event in April.

The weather remained wet for the Saturday morning practice sessions, with a lot of water being lifted into the air from the track. Coulthard lapped fastest in the third session at 1:33.614; Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, the Jordan duo of Frentzen and Trulli, Sauber&#x27;s duo of Mika Salo and Pedro Diniz and Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen followed in the top ten. Several drivers went off the wet track during the session. Diniz spun off the track at Club corner, damaging his car&#x27;s front suspension triangle and nose cone in a crash with the tyre barrier. Before the end of the session, Williams driver Jenson Button slid into the gravel trap at turn 14 after leaving Priory turn, and his stationary car stopped near the barrier. Button was then hit by Irvine&#x27;s Jaguar while attempting to extricate himself from the gravel. The Williams car&#x27;s front and back suspension were broken whilst the Jaguar&#x27;s monocoque was punctured. Both drivers were unhurt. Fisichella set no lap times because of an engine oil leak caused by his team changing his engine. His team changed engines between the final two sessions.

In the final practice session, which took place on a gradually drying track after the rain had ceased, Häkkinen set the fastest lap time of 1:33.132 with one minute remaining. Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, Frentzen, Verstappen, Trulli and Salo were in positions two to ten. Neither Button nor Irvine took part in the session following their accident because their cars needed repairing. Some drivers lost control of their cars on the track. Villeneuve went off the track at Club corner, but narrowly avoided a collision with a tyre barrier and returned to the circuit. The engine of Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi failed halfway around the track, causing flames to emerge from the rear of his car on the way to the pit lane after 25 minutes of the session.

==Qualifying==
The stewards permitted qualifying to proceed as planned despite the weather conditions. Each driver was limited to twelve laps during the one-hour qualifying session on Saturday 22 April, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in cloudy weather on a drying race track, with plenty of standing water. Drivers entered the circuit on scrubbed wet-weather tyres early in the session, hoping to set quick laps if rain fell, which never did. Lap times improved as the course gradually dried due to wind and sunlight exposure, and 15 drivers held provisional pole position. With a time of 1:25.703, Barrichello secured his third career pole position and first for Ferrari. He was ahead of Frentzen in second, who recorded a lap 0.003 seconds slower, despite losing control of his car on the grass at Stowe corner. It was also his best qualifying performance of the season. Häkkinen, in his first qualifying session of the season, did not secure pole position following three prior poles. On his final quick lap, he qualified third after having to slow down due to a driver error, and a understeer on his race car was remedied by fixing a setup fault. He lost a lap for slowing to allow Barrichello to past on the latter&#x27;s pole lap. Coulthard was the highest-placed British driver in fourth, after encountering traffic on his final qualifying attempts and failing to set a clean lap. Michael Schumacher, who changed his car only to make more errors, qualified fifth and missed his final lap by 0.1 seconds due to Trulli causing a yellow flag, leaving two of his remaining allocated laps untaken. Both Button and Ralf Schumacher in sixth and seventh had mixed feelings over their performances. Ralf Schumacher gave up his first two runs to avoid being hampered by slower cars, but he ran wide.

Verstappen briefly claimed pole position in the last seconds of qualifying before spinning off and taking eighth, Arrows&#x27; best qualifying result since Salo qualified sixth for the 1998 Austrian Grand Prix. Irvine finished ninth after Jaguar put three laps of fuel in his car, costing him two-tenths of a second. Villeneuve took tenth on the soft compound tyre, after regaining control of his car in a broadside slide through Abbey turn. Trulli qualified eleventh, but was unable to lap faster after being held up by a Williams car and spinning off the track. He led Fisichella in the faster Benetton cars, despite car balance issues, driver errors at turn ten and slower cars. Diniz qualified 13th, eight tenths of a second ahead of teammate Salo in 18th, both hampered by the timing of their runs. Herbert encountered yellow flags during qualifying and forced to end his final quick lap because of engine problems and Häkkinen slowing put his line at Becketts turn narrower. He was followed by Alesi and Nick Heidfeld in the Prost cars, who separated Zonta. Behind Heidfeld, who took the spare Prost car since his was not ready, and whose engine failed on his fastest run, Pedro de la Rosa in the slower Arrows took 19th, making a mistake during his final qualifying run that cost him pace and almost saw him lose control of his car towards the end of the lap. Wurz took 20th after driving the spare Benetton car due to an unidentified problem with his race car. The Minardi team sent both drivers out late in the session after working on their cars&#x27; setups and Gené and Gastón Mazzacane (who lost six-tenths of a second encountering traffic on his final run) took 21st and 22nd places.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The rain had stopped by Sunday morning, and a half-hour warm-up session was scheduled to begin at 08:30 BST (UTC+1), but Whiting delayed it by 100 minutes due to persistent heavy fog that prevented the medical helicopter from arriving at the track or flying to nearby hospitals. The Drivers&#x27; Parade was cancelled because of the delays. The McLaren drivers were faster than in qualifying, with Coulthard setting the quickest time of 1:26.800. Häkkinen finished fourth in the other McLaren, two-tenths of a second behind Coulthard. De La Rosa and Ralf Schumacher split them in second and third, respectively. Following one slow lap, Häkkinen&#x27;s race car had a pneumatic engine valve sensor failure, forcing him to drive the spare McLaren until the problem was addressed. Heidfeld&#x27;s engine cover detached from his car and landed in the middle of the track, prompting the waving of yellow flags to clear the carbon fibre debris. His team successfully installed a new cover.

==Race==

The 60-lap race, which began at 13:00 local time on 23 April 2000, drew between 60,000 and 140,000 spectators. The weather improved after the warm-up session, and it was dry and sunny before the race; conditions were expected to remain consistent throughout the race, with a 40% chance of rain. When the five red lights went out to start the race, Barrichello maintained the lead into the first corner, with Frentzen second. Michael Schumacher was stymied by the slow-starting Häkkinen on the outside and Button on his right. He chose to turn left, but his left-hand tyres went into the wet grass, causing side-by-side contact with Häkkinen. This forced Michael Schumacher to slow, falling behind Button and Villeneuve. Coulthard overtook both his teammate Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher as they duelled. Button entered the apex of Maggots corner, forcing Villeneuve and Michael Schumacher to slow. Frentzen tried to overtake Barrichello for the lead into Stowe corner at the end of the Hangar Straight, but he was too far away. Michael Schumacher passed Villeneuve at Stowe corner and battled his brother Ralf Schumacher for sixth until the entry for Bridge corner, when the former slowed on the inside to avoid a collision. Villeneuve moved from tenth to sixth by the end of the first lap.

At the end of the first lap, Barrichello led Frentzen&#x27;s heavier and less powerful car by 0.4 seconds, followed by Coulthard, Häkkinen, Button, and Villeneuve. Barrichello began to maintain a one-second advantage over Frentzen. Villeneuve oversteered through the Maggots, Becketts, and Chapel turns, and Ralf Schumacher slipstreamed past him on the inside entering Stowe corner on the Hangar Straight for sixth by braking later on lap two. Alesi dropped to 13th after being passed by Salo, and Diniz dropped three places due to an incident. The leading drivers had gradually pulled away from Trulli by lap three. Michael Schumacher was behind Villeneuve because the BARs were faster on the straights while being a second slower than the six drivers ahead of him and Schumacher was coming under pressure from Verstappen. Two laps later, Wurz gained another position by passing Zonta for 15th. Häkkinen drove wide on lap eight after he outbraked himself into Brooklands corner and was pressured by Button.

By the 14th lap, Barrichello had a six-tenths of a second advantage over Frentzen, who was nine-tenths of a second ahead of Coulthard. Häkkinen was nine-tenths of a second behind his teammate and continued to battle Button for fourth place, who was still 1.1 seconds clear of Ralf Schumacher. Wurz, who was pressuring Alesi in 14th, became the first driver to make a pit stop to ensure he would get a clear track. Salo and Fisichella made pit stops over the next three laps. Verstappen in ninth slowed on lap 20 due to electrical issues in his car&#x27;s engine that had emerged six or seven laps earlier and was forced to retire from the race after Arrows were unable to fix the problem. Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher were the next two drivers to make pit stops on lap 24, returning to the track in seventh and eighth, respectively, despite the latter&#x27;s team having difficulty attaching his right-rear wheel to his car due to a loose wheel nut. Button made his pit stop one lap later and joined behind teammate Ralf Schumacher. On lap 28, De La Rosa retired at the pit lane&#x27;s side due to a hydraulic clutch failure.

Coulthard started to gain on Barrichello, who began having clutch and electrical throttle pedal issues around lap 29. Two laps later, Barrichello was slow out of Chapel corner because he missed an upshift going on the Hangar Straight. This allowed Coulthard to slipstream Barrichello&#x27;s rear down the straight and draw alongside him into Stowe corner on the outside. He repelled Barrichello&#x27;s block, which he manufactured by faking a right turn to become the new race leader while braking. Coulthard immediately began to pull away from Barrichello. Häkkinen was the first one-stopping driver to make his only pit stop of the race from third at the end of the same lap and changed a flat-spotted tyre. He rejoined in eighth. Coulthard and Villeneuve both made pit stops on lap 33; Coulthard rejoined the track in fourth, behind Frentzen. Due to an unstable engine, Barrichello lost control of his Ferrari&#x27;s rear in the middle of the entry to Luffield turn leading to the pit lane entrance. He elected to enter the pit lane on lap 35, surprising his mechanics. Barrichello had to retire after a high pressure hydraulic malfunction rendered his clutch unusable, preventing him from exiting his pit stall.

Michael Schumacher, no longer hampered by Villeneuve, took the race lead after Barrichello retired and set a new fastest lap of the race on lap 36, a 1:26.797, pulling out a gap before his pit stop by lapping a second quicker than the field. Zonta retired on the next lap after spinning into the gravel trap at the exit of Stowe circuit due to a driver error that sent him wide. Michael Schumacher made a 8.8-second pit stop on lap 38, promoting Frentzen to the lead. He returned to the track in sixth, ahead of Villeneuve. The Jordan driver made a pit stop on lap 42 handing the lead back to Coulthard. The Williams pair both made pit stops over the next two laps, promoting Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher into second and third positions. Michael Schumacher was unable to catch Häkkinen due to slower drivers impeding him. Herbert was the final driver to make a planned pit stop on lap 48, allowing his crew to re-pressurise his car&#x27;s hydraulic pressure system. When lap 49 ended with the scheduled pit stops completed the top six drivers were Coulthard, Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher and Button. Häkkinen started to gain on Coulthard on lap 51 who had a minor gearbox issue caused by a technical fault. Coulthard felt the problem but was not alerted of its seriousness by his race engineer Pat Fry over radio. On the same lap, Frentzen began to slow due to a gear selection issue, forcing him to drive in sixth gear, dropping behind Ralf Schumacher and Button.

Heidfeld retired from the event on the following lap after spinning into the gravel at Becketts corner due to an oil pressure problem and engine failure. Frentzen drove slowly to the pit lane to retire on lap 54. On lap 56, Häkkinen set a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:26.217 as he continued close on Coulthard, despite McLaren showing him an &quot;Easy&quot; pit board to slow. Villeneuve was passed by Trulli for sixth into Priory corner on lap 57, before retiring from the event with a gearbox selection issue caused by the hydraulic system. Coulthard slowed in the last laps to preserve his car, and he held off Häkkinen to win his second consecutive British Grand Prix and seventh in Formula One. Häkkinen finished second, 1.4 seconds behind, with Michael Schumacher third. Ralf Schumacher finished fourth, distancing his teammate Button in fifth when the latter&#x27;s exhaust broke, forcing him to have difficulties hearing his team over the radio. Trulli completed the points scorers in sixth. Fisichella finished seventh, ahead of Salo in eighth who had understeer in the final laps. Wurz, Alesi, and Diniz took the following three spots. Herbert and Irvine finished 12th and 13th in their Jaguars due to clutch issues. Gené and Mazzacane finished in the following two places, both lacking power. Villeneuve and Frentzen were the final classified finishers, despite retiring. 17 of the 22 starters finished the Grand Prix.

===Post-race===

The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and, in the subsequent press conference, Coulthard stated that passing Barrichello gave him an advantage during the pit stops. Coulthard additionally revealed that was inspired by World Drivers&#x27; Champion Nigel Mansell&#x27;s overtake on Nelson Piquet at the 1987 British Grand Prix to execute his pass on Barrichello. He also believed that his victory made him confident about posing a challenge for the Drivers&#x27; Championship saying &quot;my best years are still ahead of me.&quot; Häkkinen said his start to the race was the sort that most affected the race result, adding that his car was imbalanced, &quot;To find a good balance in the car you must first get a good run in the morning. I was lacking that, so I was unable to get the best balance in the car.&quot; Michael Schumacher said he was satisfied to finish third, adding, &quot;For most of the race I was running in 8th position, and I was wondering how the race would develop and how many points I was going to lose. At that stage I was quite happy to see Rubens in first place, taking points away from the guys like Mika and David.&quot;

Button was ecstatic to score two championship points for finishing fifth at Silverstone, saying, &quot;To think that a year ago I was camped out in a motorhome in the middle of the circuit and only went down to Stowe to watch the last couple of laps – it is pretty amazing. I remember thinking that I might be testing in the week leading up to the race, but that was it.&quot; Barrichello expressed disappointment at losing the opportunity to win his first Grand Prix due to his retirement, adding that his clutch and throttle troubles allowed Coulthard to pass him. Frentzen felt his Jordan team should have been able to finish in the first four places because their two-stop strategy was allowing them to be close to McLaren and Ferrari, &quot;We were competitive all weekend, so it is frustrating to come away without points.&quot; Villeneuve was surprised at how easy it was to stay ahead of Michael Schumacher, but disappointed that unreliability stopped him from scoring a point that could have been significant at the season&#x27;s end.

FIA president Max Mosley said Formula One&#x27;s governing body would move the event back to July if they could, refuting the suggestion that disagreements between Silverstone and Ecclestone forced the race to be held in April, &quot;We have not gone looking for problems. Everyone thinks that we want to upset Silverstone but we don&#x27;t.&quot; Michael Schumacher continued to the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 34 points following the race. Coulthard&#x27;s victory moved him from eighth to second place with 14 points. Häkkinen&#x27;s second-place finish moved him up from fourth to third and put him on 12 points. Barrichello&#x27;s retirement dropped him from second to fourth, while Ralf Schumacher remained in fifth. Ferrari maintained its World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead with 43 points, while McLaren closed to within 17 points. Williams went from fifth to third, while Benetton and Jordan dropped to fourth and fifth, respectively, with 13 races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2000 Spanish Grand Prix (formally the XLII Gran Premio Marlboro de España) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 May 2000 at the Circuit de Catalunya, in Montmeló, Catalonia, Spain with approximately 79,000 spectators. It was the fifth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 42nd Spanish Grand Prix. Mika Häkkinen of McLaren won the 65-lap race after starting second. His teammate David Coulthard finished second, with Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello third.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from Häkkinen, and Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship from McLaren entering the race. He set the fastest qualifying lap to start on pole position and held off Häkkinen on the first lap. Schumacher led until his first pit stop on lap 24, when Ferrari chief mechanic Nigel Stepney was injured by Schumacher&#x27;s right-rear tyre after Schumacher was incorrectly instructed to leave his box before the stop was completed. This moved Häkkinen to the race lead, which he held until his pit stop two laps later. Michael Schumacher led for the next 22 laps as he and Häkkinen made their second pit stops together, with Häkkinen taking the lead after a refuelling error slowed Schumacher&#x27;s pit stop. Häkkinen led the final 22 laps to achieve his first win of the season and 15th of his career.

The victory moved Häkkinen into second place in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, fourteen points behind Michael Schumacher. Coulthard dropped to third after finishing second, and Barrichello&#x27;s third place put him one point ahead of Ralf Schumacher. McLaren&#x27;s one-two finish in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship brought them within seven points of leaders Ferrari. With 12 races remaining in the season, Williams remained third with 15 points.

==Background==
The 2000 Spanish Grand Prix was the fifth of seventeen races in the 2000 Formula One World Championship, held on 7 May 2000, at the clockwise Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, Catalonia, Spain, following a two-week break from the preceding . The Grand Prix featured eleven teams of two drivers each (each representing a different constructor), with no changes from the season entry list. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the soft and medium dry compound tyres to the event.

Before the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 34 points, ahead of McLaren teammates David Coulthard (14 points) and Mika Häkkinen (12 points). Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher were tied for fourth with nine points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 43 points, 17 more than second-placed McLaren. Williams were third with twelve points, while Benetton and Jordan were fourth with eight points each.

Following the British Grand Prix on 23 April, all teams conducted in-season testing at the circuit from 25 to 28 April  in preparation for the Spanish Grand Prix. Despite spinning into the gravel early in the session, Jos Verstappen was the fastest for Arrows on the first day of testing, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Michael Schumacher was the quickest on the second and third days. The third day was hampered by several drivers stopping on the circuit due to car problems. On the final day, which was held in wet weather in the morning and during the end of the session, Michael Schumacher again remained quickest.

Coulthard was leasing his friend and Rangers F.C. chairman David Murray&#x27;s Learjet the week before the race when a ball bearing failure shut down the left engine en route to Côte d&#x27;Azur International Airport in Nice and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at Lyon-Satolas Airport in France. Coulthard, his then-girlfriend American model Heidi Wichlinski and personal trainer/bodyguard Andy Matthews survived; Murray&#x27;s personal pilot David Saunders and co-pilot Dan Worley died. Coulthard sustained bruises to his right rib cage and severe grazed elbows in the crash. FIA Formula One Safety and Medical Delegate Sid Watkins declared Coulthard fit to race. Coulthard&#x27;s survival from the accident was the main focus of comment in the motorsport media before the Grand Prix.

British American Racing (BAR) driver Jacques Villeneuve was passed fit prior to the event. At the , Villeneuve sustained a back injury after his seat became loose during the race, and the worsening effects caused him to withdraw from testing in Barcelona. He also had to go through physiotherapy. Darren Manning, BAR&#x27;s official test driver, was on standby to replace Villeneuve if necessary.

Some teams modified their cars for the event. Most teams continued to refine their vehicles&#x27; aerodynamic profiles, but no significant technical innovations were introduced at the Grand Prix. Minardi debuted Formula One&#x27;s first titanium-constructed gearbox. It was lighter than magnesium gearboxes, provided greater rigidity, and was cost-effective. Prost modified their cars&#x27; oil systems to improve engine reliability, and made minor aerodynamic changes to the front wing and floor. The team also used an updated Peugeot A20 EV2 engine during Friday&#x27;s practice sessions before reverting to the EV3 for the rest of the weekend. BAR installed a new car aerodynamic packages, which included new bargeboards and rear wings. The Williams team equipped their cars with cast titanium hub carriers, but they were not used in the race because they interfered with the brake vents operation.

==Practice==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday practice sessions were dry and overcast, but previous rainfall and undercard events made the track dirty, preventing all but nine drivers from setting a time and seven attempted a quick lap. The fastest laps were recorded late in practice. Michael Schumacher led with a lap of 1:21.982 at his second attempt to set a fast time, half a second quicker than his teammate Barrichello in second. Häkkinen was third, Ralf Schumacher fourth and Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi fifth. The two Benetton drivers were sixth and eighth, Giancarlo Fisichella ahead of Alexander Wurz; Sauber&#x27;s Johnny Herbert was seventh. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine and Verstappen were ninth and tenth.

In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher was unable to lap faster but remained fastest; Ralf Schumacher went second-fastest with a new set of tyres towards the end of the session. In positions three through ten were Barrichello, Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Coulthard, Williams&#x27; Jenson Button. Häkkinen, Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz, Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Alesi. Pedro de la Rosa lost control of his Arrows car under braking and was beached in the gravel trap, prompting the yellow flags to appear briefly. Fisichella spun 360 degrees backwards into the gravel trap at the Renault corner, then spun again at the next right-hand turn.

The weather remained dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set the third session&#x27;s fastest lap, 1:21.370, ahead of teammate Häkkinen, who was two-tenths of a second slower; both drivers set their fastest times on new tyres. Ralf Schumacher, Michael Schumacher, Villeneuve, Fisichella and Frentzen made up positions three to seven. The two Arrows drivers were eighth and ninth (with Verstappen ahead of De La Rosa) after setting identical lap times that topped the time sheets. Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo was tenth-fastest. During practice, no yellow flags were waved, though Frentzen briefly drove onto the grass late in the session.

During the final practice session, Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1:21.088 on new tyres; Coulthard was second. Barrichello was third fastest after finishing 14th the previous session. He lapped faster than Häkkinen, who struggled with a lack of grip and a loose rear end. Ralf Schumacher set the fifth-fastest time. Jordan&#x27;s drivers were sixth and seventh, Trulli ahead of Frentzen and ahead of De La Rosa, Villeneuve, and Button.

==Qualifying==
Saturday afternoon&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session saw each driver limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107 per cent of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race. The session was held in sunny and hot weather. Michael Schumacher took his first pole position of the season and 24th of his career with a time of 1:20.974 on a headwind-affected second run 43 minutes in, going more than a second quicker than the 1999 pole lap. Häkkinen joined him on the grid&#x27;s front row after lapping 0.076 seconds slower in the final seconds and held pole until Schumacher&#x27;s lap. Barrichello qualified third, feeling his car did not feel good having not made any changes. Coulthard, fourth, lost time early in qualifying due to an engine fuel pressure pick-up issue. He did not drive the spare McLaren set up for Häkkinen, believing it to be time-consuming, and he had to drive with extra fuel added by his mechanics. Ralf Schumacher, fifth, had excessive oversteer, which prevented him from lapping faster. Villeneuve qualified sixth and said he achieved the best from his car. Both Jordan drivers lined up the grid&#x27;s fourth row (with Trulli ahead of Frentzen), believing they could have a better starting position because of windy conditions.

De La Rosa and Irvine were ninth and tenth. Later that day, the FIA in a mobile laboratory analysed a fuel sample from De La Rosa&#x27;s car and declared it illegal because it did not match an earlier sample. Arrows announced it would appeal the decision, allowing de la Rosa to keep his starting spot. Button. eleventh, reported crosswinds made his car unstable. He was faster than Verstappen in the slower Arrows car, Salo in the faster Sauber after losing time in the first third of the lap, and Fisichella, who could not lap faster due to low track grip. Herbert, 15th, lost his front wing mounted television camera held on by a thin cable after hitting a kerb early in qualifying. He made a minor error that prevented him from qualifying higher. Diniz (16th) had excessive oversteer. Ricardo Zonta, seventeenth, was unable to find a suitable set-up for his BAR car, and his best lap was nine-tenths of a second slower than teammate Villeneuve&#x27;s. Alesi qualified eighteenth and was unable to lap faster due to hydraulic issues and circuit cooling. He was ahead of Wurz in nineteenth, who struggled with grip and car setup. Heidfeld&#x27;s engine failed on the circuit, and marshals extinguished a small fire when he returned to the pit lane. He drove the spare Prost car setup for his teammate Alesi and qualified 20th. The two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane were 21st and 22nd.

===Qualifying classification===

Note:
* Pedro de la Rosa had started at the back of the grid for using illegal fuel in qualifying.

==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in cool and dry weather. Despite going into the gravel after braking too deeply, Michael Schumacher set a lap of 1:22.855 to lead a session for the fifth time that weekend, and also drove the spare Ferrari. Häkkinen was second-fastest; Barrichello was third, followed by Coulthard in fourth. De La Rosa ran into the gravel trap at Elf corner after his engine cut out; he returned to the pit lane to use the spare Arrows vehicle. Coulthard was launched airborne during a lap when he mounted the kerb at the final turn, but his vehicle was undamaged. After the session, Arrows withdrew their appeal after accepting the FIA&#x27;s findings, and De La Rosa was required to start at the back of the field.

==Race==

The grid conditions were dry and particularly cloudy before the race; the air temperature ranged between and the track temperature was between . The race, which began before approximately 79,000 people at 14:00 local time, lasted 65 laps on a dry track for . Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen intended to make two pit stops during the Grand Prix, with Schumacher, the only driver in the field, opting for medium compound tyres rather than soft compound tyres. Ralf Schumacher began in a spare Williams car after his race car developed an engine sensor problem the day before. There was not an abundance of overtaking, so the race was decided by pit stops.Häkkinen made a better start than Michael Schumacher, who steered right across the circuit to block Häkkinen&#x27;s path on the outside when the race began. Consequence, Häkkinen was unable to make a strong challenge to Michael Schumacher while braking for Elf corner. Ralf Schumacher got away quickly, passing Coulthard and the slow-starting Barrichello for third. Ralf Schumacher collided with the rear of Häkkinen&#x27;s car on a large amount of dust as it exited the first right-hand turn, sending Häkkinen slightly sideways. Both drivers were able to continue, with Häkkinen ahead of Ralf Schumacher by being on the inside for the next left-hand turn. By the end of the first lap, Button had moved up from eleventh to ninth, while Irvine had dropped three places. Diniz retired after spinning into the gravel after driving onto dirt on the outside of turn three. At the conclusion of lap one, the top six drivers were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, and Villeneuve.
Michael Schumacher began to pull away from Häkkinen. On lap two, De La Rosa collided with Alesi&#x27;s rear at Wurth corner, forcing Alesi to retire. De La Rosa&#x27;s front wing broke and retired after beaching in the gravel trap at Campsa corner. Simultaneously, Irvine overtook Verstappen for twelfth position. For the next 16 laps, the gap between Michael Schumacher and the heavily-fuelled Häkkinen fluctuated from 1.6 seconds to 3.4 seconds due to driving through slower traffic, while Coulthard and Barrichello battled Ralf Schumacher for third place. Further back, Villeneuve was delaying Frentzen, Trulli, Button, Salo as the top five pulled away. Green flag pit stops began on the 18th lap, with three drivers stopping. On the next lap, Button made his first pit stop and rejoined in front of Mazzacane. Villeneuve made his only pit stop on the 22nd lap; Frentzen was promoted to sixth. After rejoining the circuit, his car caught fire after telemetry detected a drop in fuel pressure, and he pulled off the track at the exit of the long right-hand Renault corner. Trulli&#x27;s pit stop, which dropped him to 17th, proved problematic: he stalled his engine, requiring his mechanics to restart it. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop one lap later and rejoined in fifth.

On lap 24, Michael Schumacher made his pit stop. Mechanic Federico Ugozzoni raised the signboard a second before the fuel hose was removed from the Ferrari and Schumacher accelerated from his pit box. Two mechanics attempted to remove the clogged fuel hose from the car&#x27;s receptacle. Schumacher&#x27;s right rear wheel struck Ferrari&#x27;s chief mechanic, Nigel Stepney, who was assisting the refueller. Stepney was dragged before being knocked over; he was taken to the circuit&#x27;s medical centre for observation before an X-ray examination in Paris revealed a compound fracture of the tibia and stretched leg tendons. Stepney, who was replaced by reserve refuller Andrea Vacari, was ruled out for the following two . Coulthard made a pit stop on the same lap and had trouble exiting his pit box because he selected second gear. He re-emerged behind Ralf Schumacher. At the end of lap 26, Häkkinen made his first pit stop and fell behind Michael Schumacher. On the next lap, Verstappen retired in the pit lane due to a gear selection fault.All the leaders had made their stops by the start of lap 28. The top six in the running order were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard and Button. Häkkinen set the race&#x27;s fastest lap on the same lap, a 1:24.470 as he started to gain on Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher again was pressured by Coulthard in fourth. Häkkinen did not attempt to overtake the race leader, as Michael Schumacher was on the harder compound tyres. Twelve laps later, Coulthard entered the pit lane for seven-and-a-half seconds in his attempt to pass Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello. This triggered the second round of pit stops for the front-runners. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a pit stop on the following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard after being overtaken by Coulthard on the outside at Elf corner. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen made their pit stops on the 42nd lap, with Häkkinen emerging ahead after a stop lasting 6.7 seconds because Michael Schumacher&#x27;s pit stop was problematic. The mechanics began refuelling as Vacari had difficulty fitting the fuel pump into the fuel tank neck after the tyres were installed. This meant Schumacher was stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta entered the pit lane on lap 45, promoting Button to sixth.

Coulthard closed up to Michael Schumacher (who was slowed by around 1.5 to 2 seconds per lap with air leaking from his left rear tyre) by lap 46. Coulthard attempted to overtake Michael Schumacher on the inside of the pit lane straight into the first corner of the following lap, intending to slow Schumacher at the right-hand turn. As a blocking manoeuvre, Schumacher steered right into Coulthard&#x27;s path at the last possible moment. The two drivers narrowly avoided a collision and Coulthard almost drove onto the grass. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s left-rear tyre slowed him at the last right-hand turn. Coulthard had better traction and steered to the outside on lap 48, passing Michael Schumacher (who steered right to defend) by braking later into Elf corner. Ralf Schumacher drew close to Michael Schumacher on the 50th lap. Ralf Schumacher attempted to overtake Michael Schumacher on the outside on the same lap at La Caixa corner, but was blocked by his elder brother. Ralf Schumacher was forced wide, losing momentum, and pulling back into the following Banc Sabadell turn. This allowed Barrichello to pass both drivers on the inside for third.

Michael Schumacher entered the pit lane on lap 51 for a new set of tyres. He remained fifth, ahead of Button, who was significantly behind Schumacher. He immediately set new personal fastest laps in an effort to catch Ralf Schumacher. However, the order was stable at the front of the field, with Häkkinen leading significantly over Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher dropping back from Barrichello. Button, sixth, retired at the side of the circuit on lap 63, with smoke billowing from his engine that failed without warning. Häkkinen maintained his lead to achieve his first victory of 2000 and the 15th of his Formula One career following the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix the previous season in a time of 1:33.55.390 at an average speed of after 65 laps. Coulthard drove with three cracked right-hand side eighth and tenth ribs, as well as a bruised right chest wall. He finished second, 16 seconds behind his teammate. Barrichello was third, with Ralf Schumacher fourth, Michael Schumacher fifth and Frentzen was the final points-scorer in sixth. Salo, Zonta, Fisichella, Wurz and Irvine were the next five finishers, and Trulli, Herbert, Gené (who lacked fuel in his car), Mazzacane, Heidfeld and Button (despite his retirement) were the final classified finishers.

===Post-race===

The top three drivers appeared on the podium to receive their trophies and later spoke at a press conference. Häkkinen said that he was &quot;pleased&quot; to win the race, and admitted to waiting until the pit stop phase to have any chance of overtaking Michael Schumacher. He said that McLaren had more work to do on his car and was looking forward to the next race. Coulthard believed he made the right decision to race despite his injuries, and that the result was &quot;the best thing that could have happened for the team and myself.&quot; He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal. Barrichello admitted that the race had not been good for him until his overtake on Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher, and said the absence of Stepney caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual.

Attention focused on the battle between Ralf Schumacher and Michael Schumacher during the race. Michael Schumacher blamed his brother for the move and did not understand why he was upset about it. Ralf Schumacher made no comment and stated that he would watch a video of the incident before commenting. Rolf, their father, spoke with the two brothers in an attempt to reconcile the two drivers. Ralf Schumacher said a week after the race that tensions between him and his brother had subsided and that there was no resentment between them, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a lot of fun when we are out there on the track duelling against each other.&quot; There was similar ill-feeling between de la Rosa and Alesi after their collision on lap two. Alesi accused de la Rosa of blocking him and causing the crash by failing to check his mirrors, while de la Rosa claimed he tried to overtake him in a difficult corner.

Ron Dennis, the McLaren team owner, called it &quot;very good outcome&quot; and was pleased with his team&#x27;s strategy, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s a great day, particularly satisfying not only when you think of the pressure that&#x27;s unique to catching up, but also the circumstances of the week, with David&#x27;s accident.&quot; Ferrari team principal Jean Todt admitted that his team were disappointed with their final result, but added: &quot;However, we have always known that even a big advantage can easily be reduced. It was a good fight between Michael and Hakkinen, at least up to the second pitstop.&quot; Following the race, Michael Schumacher apologised to Stepney for injuring him.

The final results moved Häkkinen from third to second in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, reducing Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead from 20 to 14 points. Coulthard&#x27;s second-place finish dropped him to third, two points behind Häkkinen. Ralf Schumacher fell to fifth with 12 points, while Barrichello moved to fourth with 13 points. Ferrari maintained their World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead, but McLaren&#x27;s one-two finish brought them within seven points. Williams remained third with nine points. Frentzen&#x27;s sixth-place finish moved Jordan into fourth place, one point ahead of Benetton in fifth, with twelve races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2000 European Grand Prix (officially the 2000 Warsteiner Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held on 21 May 2000, at the Nürburgring in Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, in front of 142,000 spectators. It was the sixth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, as well as the ninth Formula One European Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher of Ferrari won the 67-lap race after starting second. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen finished second and teammate David Coulthard finished third.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship heading into the race, while Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Coulthard earned his ninth career pole position by setting the fastest qualifying lap. His teammate Häkkinen made a brisk getaway from third to take the lead into the first corner. He led for the first ten laps until Michael Schumacher overtook him on lap 11. On lap 12, heavy rain forced the entire field to make pit stops to switch from dry compound to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher led until his second pit stop on lap 36, when he handed over the lead to Häkkinen for the next nine laps before regaining it. Michael Schumacher won the race, with Häkkinen finishing second 13.822 seconds later and Coulthard finishing third one lap later. It was Schumacher&#x27;s fourth win of the season and his 39th overall.

The race result extended Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead over Häkkinen in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 18 points. Coulthard remained third and increased his lead over the second Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello in fourth. Ferrari extended their lead over second-placed McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to ten points. Despite not scoring points, Williams remained third, while Benetton passed Jordan for fourth place with eleven races of the season left.

==Background==
The 2000 European Grand Prix was the sixth of seventeen races in the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the ninth event in the series&#x27; history. It was held at the 13-turn Nürburgring in the German town of Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate on 21 May 2000, having been moved to May from September due to the inclusion of the to the calendar. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the Soft and Extra Soft dry compound tyres as well as the soft and hard wet-weather compounds to the event.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 36 points entering the race. Mika Häkkinen of McLaren was second with 22 points, and his teammate David Coulthard was third, another two points behind. Rubens Barrichello in the second Ferrari was fourth with 13 points and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher was fifth with 12 points. Ferrari (49 points) led McLaren by seven points in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Williams was third with 15 points. Jordan and Benetton competed for fourth place.

After the Spanish Grand Prix on 7 May 2000, the teams conducted in-season testing to prepare for the event. The McLaren, Sauber, Benetton, Jordan, Arrows, British American Racing (BAR) and Williams teams tested at the Circuito de Jerez between 9 and 11 May. Coulthard missed the test to rest after suffering three broken ribs in a plane crash in Lyon. His teammate Häkkinen led the first day of testing and BAR driver Ricardo Zonta led the second. Alexander Wurz set the fastest lap for the Benetton team on the final day. The Prost team tested the AP03&#x27;s aerodynamic components over three days at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours with driver Nick Heidfeld. Luca Badoer spent three days at the Fiorano Circuit practising pit stops and testing the F1-2000&#x27;s aerodynamic and mechanical setups. At the Mugello Circuit, Barrichello tested a new engine and tyres for the car.

Michael Schumacher won the season&#x27;s first three races, putting him well ahead of Häkkinen, who had reliability issues in Australia and Brazil. Coulthard then won the , while Häkkinen won the Spanish Grand Prix, after Michael Schumacher&#x27;s poor performance in both races. Häkkinen said the gap was not significant given the season&#x27;s remaining twelve races and that he was better able to handle pressure, &quot;In this sport something weird always happens. If I were in Michael&#x27;s shoes I would be getting a little bit worried at seeing us pick up two wins in a row – more than that, two 1–2 finishes.&quot; Coulthard said he would not let three broken ribs slow him down and hoped McLaren would finish first and second, &quot;We are slowly chipping away at Michael&#x27;s lead, but he has had this amazing run of luck and has finished every race in the points this season so it is still going to be difficult. But I am very confident, given my recent results, though it is still hard thinking about those six points I lost in Brazil when I was disqualified.&quot;

There were no changes from the season entry list for the 11 teams (each represented by a different constructor). Some teams modified their cars for the race. Both Ferrari and McLaren installed a revised aerodynamic package, primarily to improve their cars&#x27; qualifying performance. Ferrari introduced the 049B engine, as well as smaller Brembo brake callipers and lighter disc pads. McLaren installed cooling chimneys on both sides of the MP4/15 to aid in heat dissipation. Williams brought new cast titanium uprights, which they did not use in the previous Spanish Grand Prix. BAR used a new Honda engine and a revised version of its Xtrac-designed gearbox in its 002 cars. Minardi installed a revised front wing specification to their M02s following wind tunnel testing, and the team continued to use a cast titanium gearbox in Gastón Mazzacane&#x27;s car.

==Practice==

Before the race on Sunday, four practice sessions were held: two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday practice sessions took place in cool, variable weather. Overnight rain created a wet track that dried during the day. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time of 1:21.092, followed by BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve, the Jordan duo of Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jarno Trulli, Barrichello, Coulthard, Zonta, Häkkinen and Pedro Diniz for Sauber in positions two through ten. Häkkinen&#x27;s tyres locked at the Dunlop Curve corner during his final lap of the session, leaving him beached in the turn&#x27;s gravel trap.

Rain fell between the conclusion of the morning session and the start of the afternoon session. It continued to fall at the north section of the track in the early minutes of the second session before drying and lap times improved sufficiently over the next 20 minutes. Jenson Button set the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:19.808 with one minute remaining in the session thanks to a light fuel load and a new set of tyres on his Williams FW22. Wurz was 0.440 seconds slower in second. Häkkinen and Coulthard were third and fourth for McLaren. Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Trulli, Zonta, Heidfeld, and Villeneuve completed the top ten. An engine fault curtailed Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s running and Giancarlo Fisichella damaged his Benetton car&#x27;s left-hand side against a trackside tyre barrier. Coulthard spun on a kerb at the Veedol chicane.

The weather was cold and overcast on Saturday morning. In the third practice session, Michael Schumacher lapped fastest at 1:18.527, ahead of Häkkinen, Frentzen, Coulthard, Pedro de la Rosa of the Arrows team, Ralf Schumacher, Zonta, Villeneuve, Button and Barrichello. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen&#x27;s running was curtailed after 17 minutes due to smoke billowing from his engine. Button struck the track&#x27;s kerbs, spun, and crashed into the tyre barrier.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s time did not improve; he remained the fastest driver in the fourth practice session. In second, Barrichello was driving faster, but finished the session 0.227 seconds slower than his teammate. Häkkinen and Coulthard dropped to third and fourth, respectively, while Frentzen fell to fifth. Fisichella improved to sixth, with Villeneuve, Ralf Schumacher, De La Rosa and Trulli completing the top ten. During the session, Coulthard slid into a gravel trap at turn three though he rejoined the track without any apparent damage. He stopped at the side of the circuit at the Ford Kurve and track marshals extricated his car into an escape road. Marc Gené spun his Minardi car at the Castrol-S chicane and Ralf Schumacher drove into the grass after running deep at the Veedol chicane.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order determined by their fastest qualifying laps. The 107% rule was in effect during this session, requiring each driver to stay within 107% of the fastest lap time in order to qualify for the race. The circuit was damp from an earlier rain shower, and more rain was forecast, prompting teams to install the extra soft compound tyres on their cars, and drivers ventured onto the track early in qualifying. A heavy rainstorm made the track slippery in the final 25 minutes, preventing drivers from lapping faster. Every driver exited the pit lane with two minutes of qualifying remaining in order to maximise the benefit of driving on a dry circuit. Coulthard took McLaren&#x27;s first pole position in event history, his first since the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix and the ninth of his career with a lap of 1 minute and 17.529 seconds set 26 minutes in. Michael Schumacher, who had the pole position until Coulthard&#x27;s time and ran wide at the Ford Kurve, joined him on the front row. This formation continued on the second row, with Häkkinen third after not feeling confident in his car&#x27;s setup and Barrichello fourth after driver errors on his first two timed laps. Fifth-placed Ralf Schumacher was caught out by the change in conditions on a timed lap and went straight on at the Veedol chicane. Trulli, nursing a perforated eardrum, improved in the final minutes to go sixth, while Fisichella in seventh was delayed by Ralf Schumacher at the Coca-Cola Kurve. 

Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine was baulked by one of the Prost cars en route to eighth. Villeneuve in ninth failed to begin a fourth timed lap before qualifying ended. Frentzen qualified tenth as Verstappen slowed his first timed lap. Button, 11th, bemoaned entering the track earlier than planned for his first timed lap, and slower traffic hampered his final lap. A strategic error by the Arrows team left De La Rosa 12th and his teammate Verstappen 14th. They were separated by Heidfeld who fell from ninth to 13th in qualifying&#x27;s final moments because he did not start a fourth timed lap. Wurz was caught out by the weather change and took 15th. Diniz in 16th missed an opportunity to begin his final timed lap and Johnny Herbert&#x27;s Jaguar was 17th. After his race car&#x27;s electronic management system shut down the gearbox, Jean Alesi in 18th switched to the spare Prost setup for teammate Heidfeld. He spun on the wet track and returned to the pit lane to retake his race car until the gearbox failed. Zonta qualified 19th because his car&#x27;s setup slowed him and another driver prevented him from setting his final timed lap because the session ended less than a second before he crossed the start/finish line. Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo was another driver who missed the cut-off time for his final timed lap and took 20th. Because of slower traffic, Gené and his teammate Mazzacane qualified 21st and 22nd, respectively.

=== Post-qualifying ===
When Heidfeld&#x27;s car was pushed onto the weighbridge during qualifying, it was discovered to be under the minimum weight limit. This resulted in a one-tenth of a second improvement per lap but had no effect on his qualifying time. The Prost squad was summoned to meet the stewards and accepted that the car was underweight. The stewards disqualified Heidfeld from the race in accordance with Formula One&#x27;s Technical Regulations. The Prost team filed no appeal.

* – Nick Heidfeld was found to have a car underweight and was barred from the race.

==Warm-up==

A 30-minute warm-up session on Sunday morning took place in cool and dry weather. All drivers fine-tuned their race set-ups and set laps in their spare cars. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time in the session&#x27;s final seconds, 1:20.251. Häkkinen in second was nine thousandths of a second slower. The top ten included Frentzen, Barrichello, Verstappen, Coulthard, De La Rosa, Villeneuve, Irvine, and Trulli. Near the end of the session, Fisichella&#x27;s car&#x27;s left rear wheel detached, and a track marshal retrieved it as it rolled onto the track.

==Race==
The race began at 14:00 local time and drew 142,000 spectators. The weather was overcast and dry at first with an 80% chance of rain. The air temperature was and the track temperature . Except for Villeneuve, Verstappen, Barrichello, and Michael Schumacher, all drivers began on the soft compound tyre. Coulthard was slow to react due to an unstable rear of his car; his teammate Häkkinen made a brisk getaway to drive in-between Coulthard and Michael Schumacher and take the lead going into the Castrol-S chicane despite brief contact with Schumacher. Villeneuve moved from ninth to fifth by driving on the outside. Ralf Schumacher turned left to draw alongside Villeneuve and held fourth place as Villeneuve went onto the grass. Further down the field, Trulli and Fisichella collided at the Castrol-S chicane, breaking Trulli&#x27;s left-rear suspension and he stopped at the side of the track to retire. Frentzen was forced into the gravel at the same corner by the two Arrows, allowing them and Diniz to pass. Going downhill to the Dunlop chicane, Villeneuve stopped Ralf Schumacher from passing him for fifth.

At the end of the first lap, Häkkinen was 0.562 seconds ahead of Michael Schumacher, who was 0.998 seconds ahead of Coulthard in third. Barrichello was fourth, Villeneuve fifth, and Ralf Schumacher sixth. On lap two, Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap at the time, completing the circuit in 1 minute and 22.438 seconds. On the same lap, De La Rosa overtook teammate Verstappen for ninth and Alesi passed Button for 13th. Frentzen retired on lap three with smoke billowing from the rear of his car due to a piston sealing a gap between the engine&#x27;s combustion chamber and crankcase failing. At the front, another fastest lap from Michael Schumacher lowered Häkkinen&#x27;s advantage to 0.4 seconds. A lack of rear grip affected Coulthard&#x27;s handling and the fourth-placed Barrichello pressured him. Villeneuve in fifth was distanced by the top four. On lap four, Ralf Schumacher was passed by Fisichella for sixth and De La Rosa overtook Irvine for eighth. Fisichella drew close to Villeneuve in fifth as De La Rosa overtook Ralf Schumacher for seventh two laps later.

On the eighth lap, Michael Schumacher set the race&#x27;s overall fastest lap, a 1:22.269 lap in which he used less of the track than Häkkinen. Villeneuve made a driver error at the Veedol chicane on lap nine, allowing Fisichella&#x27;s better traction and car handling to steer right out of the turn and pass Villeneuve into the Coca-Cola Kurve. Light rain began to fall on the tenth lap. Cresting a hill to the Veedol chicane on lap 11, Michael Schumacher slipstreamed Häkkinen, and put him wide, making a pass to the left for the lead. Häkkinen lost traction and Michael Schumacher led by four-tenths-of-a-second at the end of the lap. The rain became more intense on the next lap and the track became slippery Barrichello had a better exit from the Coca-Cola Kurve and overtook Coulthard for third on the start/finish straight. Further back, Irvine passed Ralf Schumacher at the Veedol chicane for eighth and Wurz lost tenth to Alesi. The rain made teams unsure whether to pit for wet-weather tyres though Herbert began the pit stop phase at the end of lap 12.

In clear air, Michael Schumacher extended his lead on the damp track over Häkkinen to more than five seconds by the 13th lap. Gené spun onto the grass and damaged the front wing on the lap for which he entered the pit lane to have it replaced. McLaren abandoned Häkkinen&#x27;s heavy fuel load strategy, allowing him to drive with more fuel than most drivers before a late race pit stop. Coulthard made his first pit stop on the next lap; Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen followed on lap 15. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s refueller discovered no fuel had been inserted into the car for three seconds before resetting the fuel nozzle. Häkkinen&#x27;s pit crew struggled to fit the right-rear wheel on his car, keeping him stationary for an additional ten seconds. Michael Schumacher rejoined the race ahead of Coulthard, while Häkkinen dropped to fifth. Coulthard turned left into turn three, attempting an overtake on Michael Schumacher, who responded by blocking Coulthard&#x27;s path. Barrichello led one lap before his pit stop on lap 16 and Ralf Schumacher followed suit. Because he spent longer on the wet track on the dry compound tyres than his teammate, Barrichello emerged in ninth and Michael Schumacher regained the lead. On the 19th lap, Fisichella drove right to pass De La Rosa going downhill to the Dunlop-Kurve hairpin for fourth and repelled the latter&#x27;s manoeuvre to retake the position.

By the 20th lap, Häkkinen lapped fastest to close the gap to Michael Schumacher by two seconds per lap, while his teammate Coulthard had lost seven seconds to the latter. Coulthard went to the left of the Veedol chicane, allowing teammate Häkkinen to pass him for second on the next lap. Michael Schumacher lost control of his car at the Veedol chicane on lap 22 but kept the lead. Further back, Barrichello overtook Verstappen, Irvine and Ralf Schumacher to return to fifth place by lap 23. Two laps later, Ralf Schumacher passed Herbert for ninth. On lap 28, Salo&#x27;s car suffered a driveshaft failure, causing him to lose control and retire in a gravel trap. At the end of lap 29, Verstappen overtook Irvine on the outside as they exited the Coca-Cola Kurve for seventh. Irvine tried to reclaim seventh by outbraking Verstappen into the Castrol-S chicane. He lost rear grip after the apex and slid into the side of Verstappen&#x27;s car. Ralf Schumacher spun into the back of the Jaguar as Irvine spun in front of him. At turn three, Ralf Schumacher spun onto the grass, and Irvine&#x27;s rear wing detached. The loss of downforce beached Irvine in the gravel trap, as Verstappen spun and crashed against the right-side tyre barrier exiting the Ford Kurve.

Further up the field, Barrichello caught and overtook Fisichella into the Veedol chicane for fourth on lap 32. On the next lap, he entered the pit lane as Ferrari&#x27;s technical director, Ross Brawn, switched Barrichello to a three-stop strategy to better recover positions on wet tyres on a wet track. On lap 35, Michael Schumacher made a pit stop for enough fuel to finish the race. On lap 36, Häkkinen took the lead with Schumacher second. He in his lighter fuelled McLaren increased the lead to 25.6 seconds by lap 40 since Michael Schumacher had a heavily fuelled car. Three laps later, Alesi overtook Wurz for tenth. Häkkinen had delayed his second pit stop for ten laps; unable to build up a large enough lead due to slower traffic, he led by 21.9 seconds by lap 44. He and teammate Coulthard made their final pit stops on lap 45, rejoining in second and fifth place, respectively. After their pit stops, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 12.5 seconds with the yet-to-stop De La Rosa third. On lap 46, Villeneuve was told to enter the pit lane to retire from fifth because his team detected an engine fault linked to a valve issue via telemetry. De La Rosa made his stop on the 48th lap, moving Barichello to third and Coulthard to fourth. On that lap, Gené retired with a failed accelerator throttle.

On lap 49, Button was duelling Herbert when he ran into the back of Herbert&#x27;s car at the slow Veedol chicane, causing a hole in the leading edge of the Williams&#x27; front wing that Button failed to notice; both drivers remained on the circuit and continued. Barrichello made the race&#x27;s final pit stop on lap 51. Barrichello gained seven seconds on Coulthard, but the gap was insufficient for Barrichello to maintain third place, and he dropped to fourth. Zonta&#x27;s rear wheels locked under braking three laps later, sending him spinning into a gravel trap and then beaching on a kerb. Wurz outbraked Button going uphill towards the Veedol chicane on lap 61 to take tenth. On the next lap, Wurz went to the right of Herbert, who remained wide to allow Wurz to negotiate the Coca-Cola Kurve. Wurz was faster than Herbert and collided with him. Both cars spun 180 degrees into a gravel trap and retired. Their retirements moved Button to seventh. He remained there until enough water penetrated the hole in his front wing, causing a sudden electrical fault that shut down the engine on lap 65.

Unhindered in the final 19 laps, Michael Schumacher negotiated his way past slower traffic while aquaplaning on worn tyres, finishing first for his fourth victory of the season and 39th of his career in a time of 1 hour, 42 minutes, and 0.307 seconds at an average speed of . Häkkinen came in second 13.822 seconds later after losing five seconds overtaking the slower cars of Herbert, Button, Wurz and Zonta, and his teammate Coulthard was one lap behind in third due to a mechanical issue. Barrichello was close to Coulthard in fourth. Fisichella took fifth and De La Rosa registered Arrows&#x27; first points-scoring finish of 2000 in sixth. Diniz improved eight places from his starting position of 15th to finish seventh, despite spinning three times early in the race. Mazzacane raced without incident, rising from 21st to eighth. Alesi finished last after four pit stops from a faulty gearbox and a ten-second stop-and-go penalty due to a faulty pit lane speed limiter button on his steering wheel that caused him to exceed the pit lane speed limit of . The attrition rate was high, with 9 of the 21 starters finishing the race.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers collected their trophies to the podium and later spoke to the media at a press conference. Michael Schumacher stated that none of the leaders made pit stops on lap 12 because they did not want to install wet-weather tyres and discover they were slower than the slick dry compounds, &quot;We knew [the heavy rain] would come, but nobody had any idea whether it would start then or later. So obviously it was difficult. Then some drivers started to come in for rain tyres, and as soon as we saw they were faster we went straight in too.&quot; Häkkinen said his start from third to first was one of the best of his career, &quot;[When you&#x27;re third on the grid] that&#x27;s the only chance to get through. You can immediately improve your position, and I was happy to do it because the disappointment I had in qualifying was fixed.&quot; Coulthard expressed his gratitude for finishing third, calling it &quot;one of my most difficult races&quot; due to a lack of rear car grip, adding, &quot;But I knew from following other cars myself that visibility was very bad. So I just concentrated on driving my car and waiting to see where I would finish when it was over.&quot;

Barrichello was disappointed to finished fourth because he felt he could have been on the podium, &quot;Three-stops was definitely the way to make up lost time, but it was very difficult to overtake other cars in the spray. I have been looking forward to a close fought-race for some time now, and maybe I should have been on the podium today.&quot; De La Rosa achieved his first points of the season and his best finish since the 1999 Australian Grand Prix. The Arrows team owner Tom Walkinshaw said the driver&#x27;s sixth-place finish would produce &quot;a good foundation for the team to aspire to do better&quot;, and De La Rosa stated the result made up a poor start of the season, &quot;We will try now, we will have to do it. I had some very good first laps and was always with the group but not because of drivers going out – this was just a deserved point.&quot; Wurz apologised to Herbert for the collision between the two at the Coca-Cola Kurve in the race&#x27;s final laps. Frentzen called the event &quot;a very disappointing weekend all round&quot; for him and that &quot;things have just not gone our way – and that is frustrating when you know your car is competitive.&quot;

Irvine argued the three-car collision at the Castrol-S chicane on lap 30 lost him an opportunity to score points and Verstappen echoed similar feelings. Ralf Schumacher said he could not avoid the accident, &quot;I saw the accident coming between Jos and Eddie and I expected them both to slide off onto the inside. But as Irvine&#x27;s back end moved right in front of me, I had no way of getting out of the way.&quot; The new World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead between Michael Schumacher and Mika Häkkinen was 18 points in the former&#x27;s favour. Coulthard was third with 24 points, one point ahead of fourth-placed Barrichello. Ralf Schumacher maintained fifth place with 12 points. Ferrari extended its lead over McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship by three points. Williams maintained third place while Benetton passed Jordan for fourth with eleven races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2000 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the LVIII Grand Prix Automobile de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held on 4 June 2000 at the Circuit de Monaco. It was the seventh round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 58th Monaco Grand Prix. McLaren driver David Coulthard won the 78-lap race starting from third position. Rubens Barrichello finished second for the Ferrari team with Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella third.

World Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Michael Schumacher driving for World Constructors&#x27; Championship leaders Ferrari started from pole position alongside Jordan driver Jarno Trulli after recording the quickest qualifying lap time. The race was stopped due to a software glitch in the starting procedure and a collision between Jenson Button and Pedro de la Rosa that created a traffic jam. Michael Schumacher led into the first corner of the second start. After the second round of pit stops, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s exhaust failed, resulting in a left rear suspension failure and his retirement from the race. On lap 56, Coulthard, who was running in second place, took the lead. Coulthard took the win, his second of the season and ninth in Formula One, with Barrichello a further 15.8 seconds back.

Coulthard&#x27;s victory cut Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 12 points. Häkkinen maintained third place, with Barrichello trailing by seven points. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari&#x27;s lead over McLaren was reduced to five points. Fisichella&#x27;s third-place result reduced the gap to third-placed Williams to one point, with ten races of the season remaining.

==Background==
The 2000 Monaco Grand Prix was the seventh of seventeen rounds in the 2000 Formula One World Championship, taking place on 4 June 2000, at the (2.094 mi) clockwise Circuit de Monaco. The event included eleven teams (each representing a different constructor), each with two racing drivers. Control tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the soft and extra soft dry tyre compounds to the race.

Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 46 points entering the race, followed by McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen on 28 points and his teammate David Coulthard on 24 points. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 16 points, and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher was fifth with 12 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 62 points, while McLaren were second with 52. Williams were third with 15 points, Benetton fourth with 10 points and Jordan fifth with 9 points.

Following the on 21 May all teams tested across European circuits between 23 and 27 May to prepare for the Grand Prix. Jordan, Sauber, Benetton, Jaguar and Arrows tested at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo circuit which made its Formula One testing début that garnered mixed reviews from the drivers. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen led the first day of testing, from Sauber test driver Enrique Bernoldi. Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen set the second day&#x27;s quickest times. Late in the session, Fisichella collided with Jordan driver Jarno Trulli&#x27;s right-rear tyre, flipping his Benetton and temporarily stopping testing. Fisichella experienced mild thumb bruising, and Benetton withdrew second driver Alexander Wurz from testing. Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo led the final day&#x27;s running. Williams and BAR travelled to the Circuit Paul Armagnac circuit to conduct shakedown runs and test car setups. BAR tested a new control system named &quot;Athena 2000,&quot; which managed the software of the car&#x27;s engine and several chassis parts. Ferrari spent five days testing at their private test facility, the Fiorano Circuit, where test driver Luca Badoer and Michael Schumacher concentrated on aerodynamic and tyre testing, as well as testing different set-ups and driving on an artificially wet circuit.

Because of the Circuit de Monaco&#x27;s configuration, with its low average speed and quantity of low-speed corners, combined with the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car&#x27;s suspensions to work better on the circuit&#x27;s low-speed corners. The Minardi vehicles were outfitted with a new titanium cast gearbox and rear springs. McLaren sent an additional spare car to the event, giving Häkkinen and Coulthard a total of four. The team also shipped in six extra monocoques for the race. Jordan debuted an improved version of its Mugen-Honda V10 engine in the Grand Prix, while Jaguar added a reworked engine hood and a new front wing to its two cars. The Williams team installed an extra fin on the engine hood, two minor fins on the sides, and new front and back wings to their car.

==Practice==
Before the race on Sunday, there were two one-hour sessions on Thursday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The practice sessions on Thursday morning and afternoon were held in hot, dry weather. Michael Schumacher set the first session&#x27;s fastest time, 1:23.039, faster than Häkkinen by three-tenths of a second. Coulthard was third, behind Fisichella and Frentzen. Despite gearbox troubles that prompted him to pull up on the track, Alesi was sixth. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, Williams&#x27; Jenson Button, Barrichello and Salo made up positions seven to ten. Ralf Schumacher collided with the barrier near the tunnel&#x27;s entrance, necessitating pit lane repairs and Minardi&#x27;s Gastón Mazzacane spun and lost his front right wheel in an accident at La Rascasse.

Häkkinen recorded the day&#x27;s fastest lap in the second practice session, a 1:21.387; Coulthard finished third. Michael Schumacher separated the McLaren drivers. Eddie Irvine lapped faster and was fourth, ahead of Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher. Alesi, seventh, continued to struggle. Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa, Trulli and Barrichello completed the top ten. Wurz&#x27;s car collided at the Swimming Pool complex, breaking his front wing and removing one of his wheels. Nick Heidfeld lost control of his Prost car and damaged its right-hand side against the barrier at La Rascasse corner. Pedro Diniz&#x27;s Sauber car collided with the barrier at the same turn, dropping a considerable amount of oil that marshals attempted to clean up.

After taking Friday off – a race-exclusive feature – for leisure time, sponsor functions and for teams to prepare their cars for the second day of practice, the weather remained hot and dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Track evolution was observed during the third session. Michael Schumacher set the third session&#x27;s quickest lap, 1:20.762; Barrichello was third. Häkkinen was second fastest, one-tenth of a second slower than Michael Schumacher. Alesi kept improving and was fourth, faster than Coulthard, Frentzen, Irvine, Trulli, Fisichella and Sauber&#x27;s Johnny Herbert. Frentzen and Wurz went off the circuit during the session but avoided damaging their vehicles.

Coulthard led the final practice session with a lap of 1:20.405, 0.142 quicker than teammate Häkkinen&#x27;s 1999 pole lap; he stalled the engine after running down the escape road at Ste Devote to avoid a collision with the guardrail barrier. Slower cars prevented Coulthard from lapping faster. Michael Schumacher was nearly a tenth slower in second. Fisichella chose a softer damper and was third fastest. Trulli, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Alesi, Wurz, Frentzen, and Ralf Schumacher filled positions four through 10. Irvine crashed at the swimming pool complex, ending his session early.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was allowed twelve laps, with the grid order determined by the quickest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to lap within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. The session took place in hot, dry weather. Michael Schumacher took his second pole position of the season and the 25th of his career with a time of 1:19.475 with seven minutes left; he struck the metal guardrail at Portier corner entering the tunnel with his rear-left wheel but continued. Trulli, who was 0.271 seconds slower and had his best qualifying performance of the season on soft tyres and made car adjustments for better handling, joined him on the grid&#x27;s front row. Coulthard qualified third and said he could have lapped quicker as he saw a yellow flag out on the track. Trulli&#x27;s teammate Frentzen qualified fourth but criticised Irvine for an apparent blocking manoeuvre. Häkkinen took fifth in his worst qualifying result of 2000, with understeer on his second qualifying run and slower traffic on all four. Barrichello took sixth despite a nervous car. Alesi, seventh, had alternator problems in his race car early in qualifying and switched to the spare Prost car. Fisichella qualified eighth and noticed a deterioration in his car&#x27;s handling. 

Ralf Schumacher and Irvine rounded out the top ten. Herbert qualified eleventh, five hundredths slower than his teammate, and reported excessive car oversteer. He was ahead of Wurz in the slower Benetton car. Despite a misunderstanding with his race engineer over a yellow flag, Salo qualified 13th. Similarly, Button, who took 14th in the other Williams, was caught out by the waved yellow flags. Understeer, traction, and brake issues slowed Button. The two Arrows drivers were Verstappen (15th) and De La Rosa (16th); the latter crashed at the Rascasse chicane. BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve started from 17th after an engine failure into Lowes corner led him to stop at the furthest place from the pit lane and lay oil on the circuit. Villeneuve was forced to drive the spare BAR car for the rest of qualifying. Heidfeld (18th) experienced a lack of grip and understeer. He qualified ahead of Diniz and BAR&#x27;s Ricardo Zonta, who were 19th and 20th, respectively. Marc Gené and Mazzacane of Minardi qualified 21st and 22nd, respectively, but both crashed at Rascasse.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took part in a 30-minute warm-up session in dry, warm weather at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2). Barrichello set the fastest time of 1:22.251, with Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher second. Ralf Schumacher was third fastest with Coulthard fourth. The session was disrupted when De La Rosa lost traction in his car and striking the barriers leaving Tabac turn just before the session concluded – the session was ended early as marshals needed to clear the track – reducing Arrows&#x27; available race vehicles to two. After spinning on oil on the track, Herbert clipped the tyre barrier at Piscine turn in the Swimming Pool complex, forcing him to drive the spare car in the race.

==Race==

The race commenced at 14:30 local time, running for 78 laps over a distance of . The weather was warm and cloudless for the race; the air temperature was and the track temperature was . Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Häkkinen, Coulthard, Button and Mazzacane began on the soft tyre compound. Bridgestone advised drivers using the soft compound tyre to begin on new sets and those on the supersoft compound to use scrubbed tyres. The course at Sainte Devote corner had become slick owing to a two-car accident during the morning Renault Clio Cup undercard round, which saw fluids from the smashed vehicles flow onto the track, necessitating marshals to apply cement mortar in an unsuccessful attempt to dry the oil puddles. This meant a driver braking wide would lose traction on the asphalt.

Diniz was unable to launch at the start of the parade lap, forcing him to start at the back of the grid. Wurz&#x27;s engine failed during the starting procedure, and race officials aborted the start. The mechanics returned to the grid with their equipment. After Wurz&#x27;s engine failure, Diniz was allowed to start from his qualifying position as Wurz drove Fisichella&#x27;s spare car. The race began eight minutes late; Michael Schumacher maintained the lead into the first corner. Behind him, Trulli remained in second position. A glitch in the FIA computer software called for a race suspension, however marshals did not wave red flags to signal a race stoppage across the circuit, except at the start/finish line. De La Rosa attempted to overtake Button on the outside at the Loews hairpin, but Button&#x27;s front-right wheel collided with one of De La Rosa&#x27;s rear wheels, sending De La Rosa into a spin. This caused a traffic jam for six cars behind the two drivers, and the race was stopped because the circuit was blocked. All the cars that stopped on the circuit were abandoned. Button, Zonta, Heidfeld, Diniz, and Gené restarted in their team&#x27;s spare cars and had to start from the pit lane. De La Rosa, conversely, did not have a spare car available and was unable to restart.
Michael Schumacher and Trulli maintained their positions during the restart at 14:31 local time, while Ralf Schumacher made the best start, moving from nine to sixth by the end of the first lap while Barrichello lost two places. The order at the conclusion of the first lap was Michael Schumacher, Trulli, Coulthard, Frentzen, Häkkinen and Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher began to pull away from Trulli immediately, setting consecutive fastest laps. Häkkinen began to challenge Frentzen for fourth on lap two. Michael Schumacher led Trulli by more than 11 seconds by the 11th lap, while Wurz overtook Mazzacane for 17th. Button entered the pit lane after telemetry indicated that his engine was losing oil pressure and he retired on lap 17.

By lap 19, Michael Schumacher had extended his lead over Trulli to 19.5 seconds. Trulli was 0.7 seconds ahead of Coulthard. Frentzen was 2.1 seconds behind than Coulthard and was battling for sixth with the latter&#x27;s teammate Häkkinen. On the same lap Irvine overtook his teammate Herbert for tenth. Wurz lost control of his car and crashed into the barriers at Sainte Devote corner, causing his retirement from the race. On lap 22, Gené retired on an escape road at Casino Square corner due to gearbox failure. His teammate Mazzacane collided with the barriers at Sainte Devote turn on the following lap and retired from the event. Herbert was the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27, but his pit team was unprepared, and he was stationary for 30 seconds before exiting in 17th. Diniz crashed into the barriers at Sainte Devote corner on the 31st lap, retiring with left rear wheel damage. Diniz&#x27;s car was relocated behind the barriers by marshals, avoiding the use of the safety car. 

Häkkinen slowed on lap 36 owing to a brake pedal blockage caused by a loose sensor and made an unscheduled pit stop. His mechanics unlocked his car&#x27;s inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They cleared the blockage by removing a loose data transmitter and Häkkinen rejoined in ninth. Trulli retired in the garage on the next lap due to gearbox failure. Ralf Schumacher, fourth, took evasive action, went off the racing line and struck the right-hand Sainte Devote wall on the 38th lap, as the suspension arm penetrated the monocoque. He suffered a deep cut to his leg and was taken to hospital. Michael Schumacher held a 36-second lead over Coulthard by lap 38; Coulthard lapped frequently in the low 1:22 range to close up. Verstappen made the first scheduled pit stop on lap 41, five laps in front of Zonta and Heidfeld. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop at the end of lap 49 for a set of scrubbed tyres and 29 laps worth of fuel. He retained the lead over Coulthard. Fisichella made a pit stop earlier than expected on lap 51 due to a slow . Frentzen, Barrichello, Salo, and Villeneuve made pit stops over the following three laps. Because Villeneuve slowed Coulthard, the gap between Michael Schumacher and Coulthard did not close significantly until laps 53 and 54. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s car suffered a cracked exhaust that leaked gases under the fairing, breaking a lower left-rear suspension mounting arm since the carbon fiber suspension overheated while Schumacher was driving on the track&#x27;s centre after exiting Anthony Noughes corner on the 55th lap. This lifted Schumacher&#x27;s car front-right off the asphalt, causing him to slow to a near stop. As he was past the pit lane entry, he had to complete a full slow lap of the circuit. Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn retired Michael Schumacher in the pit lane after mechanics failed to replace the broken arm. Coulthard became the new race leader and made his final pit stop on lap 56. At the completion of lap 57, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Coulthard, Frentzen, Barrichello, Fisichella, Irvine, and Salo.

On the same lap, Häkkinen set the race&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:21.571, closing up to Salo in seventh. Verstappen, holding off Heidfeld for ninth, spun 360 degrees into a concrete barrier at the Swimming Pool complex on lap 62 and retired. Verstappen was unhurt. On the 71st lap, Frentzen, who lost concentration looking at the leader board, became the race&#x27;s final retirement when his rear suspension broke in an accident with the wall at the Sainte Devote turn. The accident promoted Barrichello to second and Fisichella to third. Häkkinen started to slow on lap 74. ending his battle with Salo but remained ahead of Villeneuve in seventh. Coulthard slightly slowed after Frentzen&#x27;s retirement, winning his second race of the season and eighth of his career in a time of 1:49:28.213, at an average speed of . Coulthard was the first British Monaco Grand Prix winner since Jackie Stewart in 1973. Barrichello followed 15.8 seconds later in second, ahead of Fisichella in third. Irvine finished fourth and earned Jaguar&#x27;s first Formula One points. Salo finished fifth, with Häkkinen rounding out the top six points scorers. Following Villeneuve, Heidfeld, and Herbert, Frentzen was the final classified finisher despite his accident.

== Post-race ==
The top three drivers appeared in Prince Rainier III of Monaco&#x27;s Royal box to collect their trophies and at the press conference that followed. Coulthard was overjoyed to win the race, which he regarded one of his career goals due to the challenges the drivers face on the circuit. He also stated that he wanted to avoid needless repairs to his car by waiting until the pit stops to pass Michael Schumacher and Trulli. Barrichello revealed that he was conserving tyres and fuel and that Brawn had advised him to slow due to an issue. Fisichella said that he was pleased to finish third. He also revealed that he wanted to remain at Benetton for the 2001 season after this result.

Irvine described the Grand Prix as one of the most difficult of his Formula One career, owing to a malfunctioning drink bottle and a blistering foot. He also said that the team&#x27;s issues were not fully rectified and it would take &quot;six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker.&quot; Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race because his car lacked power steering. Nevertheless, he was happy to finish fifth, saying, &quot;I knew that he would find it very tough to overtake here but I made extra sure I didn&#x27;t leave the slightest gap or make any mistakes. An enjoyable race for me and for the team, who really deserved this result.&quot; Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led most of it until his lap 56 retirement, saying: &quot;The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it.&quot;

Ralf Schumacher suffered a gash on his left calf. He was taken to Princess Grace Hospital for a routine check-up and his cut was stitched. Ralf Schumacher was later cleared to race in the next Grand Prix, two weeks later. He said he had no prior knowledge of the source of his injuries. Williams had their test driver Bruno Junqueira to fill in for Ralf Schumacher should the need arise. Frentzen admitted fault for the accident that cost him second place, and apologised to team owner Eddie Jordan. His teammate Trulli expressed disappointment over the gearbox failure, since he had thought he would have won the Grand Prix following Michael Schumacher&#x27;s retirement.

As a result of the race, Michael Schumacher retained the World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead, albeit by ten points to twelve. Coulthard&#x27;s victory put him in second place with 34 points, ahead of teammate Häkkinen, who had 29 points. With 22 and 14 points, respectively, Barrichello and Fisichella remained fourth and fifth. McLaren reduced Ferrari&#x27;s lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to five points. Benetton, in fourth place, narrowed the points gap to Williams, who was third, to one point. Jordan remained fifth on nine points with ten races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2000 Canadian Grand Prix (formally the Grand Prix Air Canada 2000) was a Formula One motor race held on 18 June 2000 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal, Quebec, Canada before 100,000 people. It was the eighth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 38th Canadian Grand Prix. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 69-lap race from pole position. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second with Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella third.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship going into the race, while Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. He started alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard after qualifying on pole position. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard&#x27;s teammate Mika Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled for first place until Coulthard served a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 14 because mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Michael Schumacher took an early pit stop just before half-distance, allowing Barrichello to lead the race until his own pit stop on lap 43. Rain had begun to fall by this point, and drivers had switched to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher maintained his lead for the rest of the race and won by one-tenth of a second over Barrichello.

Michael Schumacher won his fifth race of 2000 and his 40th overall. It increased his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 22 points over Coulthard, with Häkkinen another two points behind. Ferrari extended their World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead to 18 points over McLaren. Benetton, with 18 points, demoted the Williams squad to fourth place with nine races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2000 Canadian Grand Prix was the eighth of seventeen events in the 2000 Formula One World Championship and took place at the clockwise temporary road course Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on 18 June 2000. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the soft and medium dry compound tyres to the event.

Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the pre-race World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 46 points, followed by McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard on 34 points and his teammate Mika Häkkinen on 29 points. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 22 points, while Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth with 14 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 68 points, ahead of McLaren on 63. Williams were third with 15 points, Benetton fourth with 14 points and Jordan fifth with 9 points.

The Société de Transport de la Communauté Urbaine de Montréal (STCUM) declared in the weeks preceding up to the event that it would hold strikes over pension fund contributions throughout the Grand Prix weekend. STCUM chose those dates as because public transport was designated as an essential service over the high-profile weekend. The road leading to the circuit would also be closed to spectators. STCUM went before the Essential Services Council on 9 June to discuss developing a contingency plan to ensure spectators could attend the race with full services running. On June 13, a deal was agreed upon, with 60% of transport workers voting in favour of increased pay and pensions, letting the race to continue unaffected.

Following the on 4 June, the teams tested at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 6 and 8 June to prepare for the Canadian Grand Prix. Barrichello set the first day&#x27;s fastest times, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Testing was halted when Prost&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld and Luciano Burti both experienced engine and electronic failures respectively. Häkkinen was fastest on the second day. BAR driver Ricardo Zonta lost control of his car and crashed into the barriers at the Parabolica corner, limiting his testing time as repairs were made to his car. Williams&#x27; Jenson Button was quickest on the third day. Ferrari also tested at their private facility, the Fiorano Circuit, with test driver Luca Badoer, who practiced pit stops and starts, used different car set-ups, tested new car components and ran on an artificially wet track.

The event included eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) of two drivers each. Ralf Schumacher was passed fit in the days preceding the race. He had a major crash at the Sainte Devote ciorner in the last race, resulting in a gash on his left calf that required stitches. The Williams team had its test driver Bruno Junqueira ready to race if Ralf Schumacher was unable to compete. Ralf Schumacher said that he would decide whether to compete after the first free practice sessions. Two days before the race, he confirmed his participation.

Teams approached the event by concentrating on their brake cooling systems, installing larger air intakes to adapt to the circuit&#x27;s braking demands. McLaren installed power steering in their two race cars following six months of testing and research into a low-weight solution. BAR fitted power steering to Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s vehicle only for Friday&#x27;s free practice sessions because the team wanted to introduce it at future events. Arrows, Minardi, Prost, and Sauber were the only teams without power steering. Jaguar did not fit a high load aerodynamic downforce bonnet introduced at the Monaco Grand Prix. Benetton used new front and rear ailerons, while Sauber installed a qualifying grade Ferrari engine from the .

==Practice==
Before the race on Sunday, there were two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon practice sessions were held in hot, dry weather. Teams made changes to their car setups while drivers tested the updates, reporting on their effectiveness and any concerns. The majority of incidents during Friday practice occurred between turns seven and eight.

Michael Schumacher set the first practice session&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:21.304, almost a tenth of a second faster than teammate Rubens Barrichello. Coulthard was third, ahead of Häkkinen. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine was fifth fastest, ahead of Sauber&#x27;s Johnny Herbert. Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen, Fisichella, Villeneuve and Minardi&#x27;s Marc Gené were seventh through tenth. Heidfeld damaged his car&#x27;s left front suspension in a crash early in the session, and Zonta twice lost control of his vehicle by pushing hard. Coulthard set the day&#x27;s fastest time in the second practice session, lapping at 1:20.602 with 20 minutes remaining. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello were second and third, with Herbert lapping quicker in fourth. Häkkinen, fifth, reported inclement handling and excess understeer entering turns. Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Mika Salo of Sauber, Irvine, Fisichella and Villeneuve followed in the top ten.

During Saturday morning practice, the weather became more breezy, cooler and cloudy. Most teams fine-tuned their vehicles&#x27; aerodynamics and used new and worn tyres at both the front and rear. Due to oil pressure issues, Ralf Schumacher had a new engine installed in his car, and extra downforce was added to his car, which had been considerably modified. Häkkinen led the third practice session with a lap of 1:19.115. Barrichello was second, 0.089 seconds slower than Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher was third fastest, ahead of Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Fisichella, Verstappen and Herbert in places four to ten. Coulthard did not set a lap time during practice because his engine was changed owing to a malfunctioning electrical system. 

Most participants lapped faster in the last practice session. Coulthard enjoyed a trouble-free practice and was fastest just under halfway through with a time of 1:18.654, which was less than half a second slower than the circuit record lap set during qualifying for the 1998 race. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello maintained their pace from Friday, going second and third. Häkkinen was fourth and could not go faster when he passed an area with waved yellow flags. Trulli was fifth, ahead of Ralf Schumacher, who drove faster following set-up alterations. Villeneuve, Frentzen, Salo and Fisichella were seventh to tenth. Some drivers lost control of their cars during the session. Heidfeld&#x27;s engine failed halfway through practice and dropped oil on the circuit, catching out Benetton&#x27;s Alexander Wurz. His Prost teammate Jean Alesi stopped on the grass when his car ran out of fuel. Pedro Diniz&#x27;s Sauber chassis and undertray were damaged after mounting a kerb; he qualified in the spare C19 car.

==Qualifying==

Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in dry, sunny weather; winds were observed and there was a diminishing chance of rain. No driver appeared to venture onto the circuit, which was dustier and slicker than in practice, particularly at turns eight and nine, as well as the second chicane. Michael Schumacher took his third pole position of the season, and the 26th of his career, with a time of 1:18.439 set on his final lap. Coulthard qualified second, 0.098 seconds slower than Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lap, having battled the latter for grid position throughout qualifying. Barrichello qualified third after encountering traffic and a stoppage to qualifying. Häkkinen, fourth, encountered traffic during his qualifying runs and ran a defective front wing. Frentzen, fifth, struggled to find his braking point at the L&#x27;Epingle hairpin due to heavy winds. Villeneuve was sixth after locking his front tyres at the first chicane during his first full speed lap. His teammate Zonta was eighth. Trulli in seventh lacked grip in his tyres. Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa and Fisichella (driving with excess understeer and lack of traction) were ninth and tenth.

Herbert missed qualifying for the top ten by two hundredths of a second, even though he was happy with his car. Despite lacking mechanical grip, Ralf Schumacher set the 12th quickest lap. He was ahead of Verstappen who damaged his front suspension at turn four, (a corner without a run-off area), resulting in a five-minute delay to qualifying after 40 minutes. Drivers entered the pit lane and remained there until marshals cleaned the circuit and put Verstappen&#x27;s car onto a flatbed truck. The resultant damage meant Verstappen drove his team&#x27;s spare car. Wurz, 14th in the second Benetton, lost time when he caught the aftermath of Verstappen&#x27;s collision. Salo, 15th, had his rear wheel lock on downshifts. Irvine&#x27;s slower Jaguar was behind him. Alesi qualified his Prost car 17th despite an engine failure. He was ahead of Button in 18th after Button&#x27;s engine cut out at maximum revolutions per minute due to fuel-pick up fault on his final two (his third and fourth) runs. Diniz was 19th. The circuit&#x27;s slow corners compounded the Williams FW22&#x27;s poor performance, as it performed better on tracks with faster turns and both Ralf Schumacher and Button experienced car setup issues. Gené took 20th in the faster Minardi and his teammate Gastón Mazzacane completed the starting order in 22nd after facing the possibility of transgressing the 107 per cent rule for most of qualifying. Mazzacane went through the gravel and crashed at the first chicane; he drove the spare Minardi entry and then Gené&#x27;s race car to qualify. Heidfeld separated the two Minardi drivers in 21st.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track in cloudy, windy weather below at 09:30 Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4) for a 30-minute warm-up session, reporting car issues to their teams. Michael Schumacher set the fastest overall lap in his Ferrari at 1:18.932. His teammate Barrichello was second-quickest. The McLaren pair rounded out the top four fastest drivers; Häkkinen in third in front of Coulthard in fourth. Amongst the slower runners, the engine cover was shed from Heidfeld&#x27;s car on the main straight. Zonta recorded no lap times due to an engine failure on his first lap out of the pit lane and Irvine was observed driving on wet-weather tyres on a dry circuit.

==Race==
The race started before 100,000 at 14:00 local time and lasted 69 laps over a distance of . The pre-race weather was dry and cloudy with the air temperature at and the track temperature ; forecasters predicted a 70 per cent chance of rain. As the drivers began the formation lap, Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren stalled due to a clutch problem and he signalled to his mechanics for assistance. The mechanics restarted Coulthard&#x27;s car despite being warned not to on the McLaren team radio, a violation of FIA safety regulations. Coulthard took his grid position before the entire field passed him. Coulthard made a better start than Michael Schumacher, but the latter held his position going into the first corner. Meanwhile, Häkkinen resisted Barrichello&#x27;s initial attempts to pass him for third. During lap one, Villeneuve progressed from sixth to third by passing on the outside, and Verstappen moved from 13th to 10th. Villeneuve&#x27;s manoeuvre put the early braking Häkkinen wide, letting Barrichello past on the outside for fourth into turn two. A clutch failure farther down the track stranded Irvine on the grid. Marshals pushed him to the pit lane exit.

In contrast to past years, where there was a multi-car accident, no cars were damaged. At the first lap&#x27;s completion, the first six drivers were Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Villeneuve, Barrichello, Häkkinen, and Frentzen. Coulthard set a fastest lap of the race, a 1:21.335 on lap two as he closed on Michael Schumacher. De la Rosa took sixth from Frentzen at the hairpin on the same lap. He could not get close to Häkkinen because of his engine&#x27;s horsepower disadvantage. On lap four, Michael Schumacher began trading fastest laps with Coulthard as Villeneuve held third but was delaying three drivers behind him. Michael Schumacher pulled away from Villeneuve while Barrichello and Häkkinen could not beat Villeneuve&#x27;s straight-line speed. As Verstappen pressures Fisichella into a braking error and passed him for tenth place on the same lap, Button&#x27;s engine began to cut out at maximum revolutions due to a fuel pick-up issue.

As Michael Schumacher and Coulthard continued their battle up front, the stewards informed the McLaren team on lap ten that Coulthard would serve a ten-second stop-go penalty as his mechanics had worked on his car 15 seconds before the formation lap began. On the 13th lap, Ralf Schumacher overtook Herbert to take 12th position. Coulthard took his penalty on lap 14 and rejoined in tenth place. Herbert entered the pit lane with an gearbox issue on lap 15 and became the race&#x27;s first retirement. Häkkinen failed to pass Barrichello on the front straight on lap 17. On lap 20, as the skies darkened and rain showers approached, De la Rosa became the first of the two stopping drivers to make a pit stop. He reemerged in 15th position. Michael Schumacher had extended his lead over Villeneuve to 22 seconds by the 22nd lap, while Villeneuve continued to battle for second with Barrichello and Häkkinen. Frentzen trailed the trio ahead of him by 1.9 seconds. Meanwhile, Coulthard was one second slower than the race leader.

Light rain began to fall on lap 23, and the circuit became slippery, slowing Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lap times by two seconds for two laps. Trulli passed Zonta for sixth place one lap later. Coulthard lost three positions after spinning on oil dropped from Verstappen&#x27;s car at turn 12. Villeneuve lost second to Barrichello on lap 25 following a short battle and the Brazilian started to gradually close up to Michael Schumacher. As Häkkinen was closing in on Villeneuve, Barrichello began to draw away from the two. Two laps later, Trulli overtook teammate Frentzen for sixth. Both Ferrari drivers were trading fastest laps by lap 29. Meanwhile, Häkkinen began to launch a challenge to overtake Villeneuve for third place. Further down, Zonta passed Frentzen for sixth place. Jordan retired Frentzen at the end of his 33rd lap due to a drop in pressure in the rear wheel braking system, which softened the brake pedal.

Michael Schumacher, concerned with braking issues, stopped early on lap 34. Ferrari inspected his car&#x27;s rear and adjusted his front wing angle. Although Michael Schumacher had more fuel to complete extra laps, Ferrari did not feel he was under threat. He rejoined two seconds behind his teammate Barrichello, but a heavy fuel load and a car malfunction slowed him. Schumacher was ahead of Häkkinen, who passed Villeneuve on lap 35 by braking later than Villeneuve into the first turn. Heidfeld went off to the side of the circuit with an engine bay fire after making a pit stop on the 36th lap. Alesi in the other Prost stalled at his pit stop and emerged ahead of Irvine. Trulli became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 39. Alesi retired with a sudden loss of hydraulic pressure on lap 40. Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Zonta, Coulthard, Villeneuve and Fisichella made their pit stops over the next three laps. Salo retired with an engine failure on lap 43. As rain began to fall after the pit stop window closed on lap 42, every driver had switched from dry to wet tyres. Häkkinen was the final driver to make such a pit stop on lap 46. Fisichella ran wide and lost second to Barrichello on the 47th lap. 
At the conclusion of lap 47, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the first six drivers were Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Fisichella, Häkkinen, Trulli, and Wurz. Michael Schumacher went off the wet track at turn one on lap 48, remaining half a minute ahead of Barrichello. De La Rosa and Diniz were vying for 12th when contact between both drivers saw De La Rosa strike the barrier on the 49th lap. A broken wheel from the accident forced De La Rosa to retire. Verstappen and Wurz went off the track on lap 52 while duelling for sixth place. Verstappen overtook Wurz five laps later. Verstappen passed Trulli for fifth on lap 61. During lap 65, Gené lost control of his car in the middle of a straight while braking and spun onto the grass. His car stalled, causing him to retire. Villeneuve overshot an attempted overtake on Coulthard for eighth into turn 10 on the 64th lap.

On the next lap, the rain began increasing in intensity as Villeneuve performed the same pass although he hit Ralf Schumacher, causing both drivers to retire. Coulthard and Wurz collided at turn one, sending both drivers into the grass on lap 68. Wurz made a pit stop for repairs. Barrichello began to close up to Michael Schumacher in the final laps as Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn instructed him to slow. Michael Schumacher slowed due to an issue at the rear of his car he had for most of the race; he held off Barrichello to win his fifth race of the 2000 season and 40th of his career, in 1&#x27;41:12.313, at an average speed of . Barrichello finished second 0.174 seconds behind his teammate in a formation finish, with Fisichella securing the final podium in third because his pit stop for wet-weather tyres (following a quick decision not to install dry grooved tyres) came just as the rain fell. Häkkinen finished fourth after passing the pit lane entry just as rainfall arrived. Verstappen was fifth and Trulli completed the points scorers in sixth. Coulthard, Zonta, Wurz, and Diniz filled the next four spots, with Button, Mazzacane, and Irvine finishing at least one lap behind the victor. Despite not finishing the Grand Prix, Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, and Gené were the final classified runners.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Ferrari team member Ignazio Lunetta appeared on the podium to receive the winning manufacturer&#x27;s award. Michael Schumacher explained that his early pit stop was due to a suspected sensor failure that caused his crew to receive misinformation. He also stated that the wet weather prompted him to shift his car&#x27;s brake balance to the front. Barrichello stated that he warned Brawn that if it rained for ten more laps, it would be faster to make an extra pit stop. Nonetheless, he stated that he trusted his team&#x27;s judgement and revealed that his car developed a clutch problem during the race. Fisichella remarked that he was racing conservatively due to his one-stop strategy. He also praised the team for maintaining a continuous run of podium finishes at the circuit.

Häkkinen said that his race was &quot;over&quot; when the rain began falling, having failed to finish higher. Verstappen scored his first points since the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix. Verstappen was pleased with the outcome and thanked his team for moving to wet tyres while staying in communication with his mechanics. Trulli remarked that he had &quot;never had to work so hard for one point&quot; because of the amount of pressure he was under. Coulthard stated that stalling his car cost him the race win and that it was his fault. On the other hand, he criticised his penalty, believing that Formula One&#x27;s governing body, the FIA, should have allowed race stewards more freedom in determining whether a driver gaining an advantage. David Tremayne of &quot;The Independent&quot; noted had Coulthard raised his hand before the start, he might have started from the back of the grid.

The stewards penalties Villeneuve and Diniz 25 seconds to their total race times for their crashes with Ralf Schumacher and de la Rosa, respectively, because a decision was not reached prior to the race&#x27;s last five laps. Villeneuve and Diniz were each reprimanded following a review of video footage and interviews of all the involved drivers. McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was critical of Villeneuve&#x27;s driving in the event, saying he was driving &quot;in a way that was verging on the kamikaze. He had nothing to lose and was driving in Canada in front of his home crowd and was clearly on a mission.&quot; Villeneuve admitted he was fault for causing the accident that saw him collide with Ralf Schumacher and apologised to Schumacher. De La Rosa thought it would better for all to watch footage of his accident with Diniz on television and called Diniz&#x27;s manoeuvre &quot;very dangerous&quot;. Diniz felt that De La Rosa should have been more intelligent by slowing.

The result increased Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 56 points, 22 more than second-placed David Coulthard. Häkkinen stayed third, two points behind his teammate, while Barrichello, in fourth, closed the gap to Häkkinen to four points. Fisichella finishing third kept him in fifth place on 18 points. Ferrari&#x27;s one-two finish extended their lead over McLaren to 18 points in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Benetton overtook Williams for third place, while BAR remained fifth with nine races in the season remaining. Despite Michael Schumacher and Ferrari&#x27;s increased points lead, Coulthard maintained that his main competitors could be caught in the season&#x27;s last nine races, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s still a long way to go in the championship and anything can happen.&quot;

<text>The 2000 French Grand Prix (officially the LXXXVI Mobil 1 Grand Prix de France) was a Formula One motor race contested on 2 July 2000 at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in Magny-Cours, Burgundy, Central France, attended by 112,112 spectators. It was the 86th French Grand Prix and the ninth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard won the 72-lap race after starting second. His teammate Mika Häkkinen finished second with Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello third.

Before the race, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Coulthard started the race alongside Michael Schumacher, who started from pole position after setting the fastest qualifying lap. Barrichello started third and passed Coulthard entering the first corner. Michael Schumacher retained his early lead and led after the first round of pit stops. During the race&#x27;s second stint, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to reduce the deficit and pass him on lap 40. Coulthard won the race after retaining his lead during the second round of pit stops. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 due to engine failure, advancing Häkkinen to second place. Barrichello finished third, followed by BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve in fourth.

Coulthard won his third race of the season and his eighth in Formula One, reduced Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to twelve points. Häkkinen remained third with 38 points, six more than Barrichello. McLaren&#x27;s one-two result in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship allowed them to close the deficit on Ferrari to six points with eight races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2000 French Grand Prix was the ninth of seventeen rounds in the 2000 Formula One World Championship, contested on 2 July 2000 at the clockwise Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in Magny-Cours, Burgundy, Central France. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone delivered the more balanced and less grippy Soft and the faster Extra Soft dry compound tyres to the event. Bridgestone technical director Yoshihiko Ichikawa urged teams to use extra soft compounds instead of soft tyres because they provided more car grip and understeer was less noticeable at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours than on rougher circuits. The event featured eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) with two drivers each, with no changes from the season entry list.

Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 56 points before the race, followed by McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard on 34 and his teammate Mika Häkkinen on 32. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 28 points, with Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella fifth with 18 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 84 points. McLaren and Benetton were second and third with 66 and 18 points, respectively, and Williams and Jordan contended for fourth with 15 and ten points, respectively.

Following the on 18 June, the teams (except for Minardi due to a transport strike in Italy) tested at the track between 21 and 23 June to prepare for the upcoming French Grand Prix. Coulthard led the first day from McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen lost control of his car after a mechanical failure and crashed into the barriers at turn two. Verstappen suffered neck strain and withdrew from testing. He was later cleared to compete in the Grand Prix. Coulthard remained fastest on the second day. Fisichella damaging the underside of his car&#x27;s chassis, limiting his testing time while Benetton repaired his car. On the final day of testing, Häkkinen was fastest. Michael Schumacher stopped on track as his Ferrari engine failed, necessitating the installation of a replacement engine into the chassis. On 27 June, Ferrari went to their private testing facility, the Fiorano Circuit, where test driver Luca Badoer shakedown three Ferrari F1-2000 cars and practised pit stops.

After the Canadian Grand Prix, where he stalled on the grid before the formation lap before receiving a ten-second stop-go penalty because his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race started, Coulthard said that Ferrari could still be caught in the season&#x27;s nine remaining races. He commented: &quot;We have to look towards Magny-Cours and put this (Montreal) race behind us. The championship is not over yet and although we cannot change what happened in Canada, we can try to close the gap.&quot; After Häkkinen&#x27;s recent poor results, British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC) president and former world champion Jackie Stewart backed Coulthard to win the championship. Michael Schumacher was optimistic that his car would perform well on the track. Flavio Briatore, Benetton&#x27;s team principal, downplayed his team&#x27;s chances, saying: &quot;We need a miracle to finish on the podium.&quot;

Almost every team modified their cars for the event. Ferrari introduced chimney stacks on the F1-2000 during free practice for the first time and additional vents to extract warm air for aerodynamic efficiency. The team reverted to previous specifications for qualifying and the race. It also modified the axle construction at the car&#x27;s bottom with composite materials designed to minimise friction when it touched the asphalt surface. McLaren installed a new extractor profile for free practice and qualifying but removed it for warm-up and the race. It also asymmetrically positioned the rear-view mirrors, the right placed further forward and lower than the left for improved visibility in the track&#x27;s final corner. Sauber modified the sides&#x27; opening and BAR installed a new body and ailerons. Peugeot provided Prost with an upgraded V10 engine for driver Jean Alesi, who slammed the engine&#x27;s driveability. Jordan debuted a revised braking system.

==Practice==
Before the race on Sunday, there were two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon practice sessions were held in hot, dry weather. Michael Schumacher set the first practice session&#x27;s fastest lap at 1:16.474, two tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Prost&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld was third, ahead Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert were fifth and seventh. Fisichella came in sixth, separating the two. Alesi, Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa, and Williams&#x27; Jenson Button finished eighth through tenth. Only four drivers set timed laps after two-thirds had passed and fourteen others set one timed lap before returning to the pit lane. Just four drivers set no laps: Coulthard&#x27;s car experienced a mechanical fuel pump issue, Barrichello drove one installation lap to preserve tyre use and both Jordan drivers sat out the session.

Coulthard led the second practice session with a lap of 1:16.253 despite losing 25 minutes due to an oil tank leak that his crew remedied by removing the engine in his car, limiting his running to four minutes; Häkkinen ended second fastest. Ferraris were second and fourth, with Michael Schumacher ahead of Barrichello. Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo was fifth fastest, ahead of Fisichella, Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Heidfeld, Ralf Schumacher and Trulli&#x27;s teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen in positions six through ten. The lack of grip at the tight last corner leading onto the pit lane straight caught out some drivers. The overall grip was poor around the course and BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta beached their cars in the gravel trap. Trulli stalled attempting to simulate a standing start.

The weather remained dry and hot for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Every racer could drive on the circuit in preparation for qualifying later that day. Coulthard set the third session&#x27;s fastest time, a 1:15.965, the first driver to lap faster than 1:16. Häkkinen was second fastest, almost two-tenths slower than Coulthard. Jordan teammates Trulli and Frentzen were both faster than the day before, with Trulli third and Frentzen fourth. Jaguar&#x27;s Irvine was fifth and Herbert was eighth. Michael Schumacher and Button separated them. Barrichello and de la Rosa were ninth and tenth, respectively.

Coulthard was unable to improve his time in the last practice session due to an engine problem halfway down the track, forcing him to enter the pit lane with smoke billowing from his car, although remaining fastest overall. Because there was insufficient time to fix the problem during practise, Coulthard&#x27;s mechanics replaced the engine in his vehicle for qualifying. Häkkinen lapped faster and remained second. Barrichello went quicker and was third fastest, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Jordan drivers Trulli and Frentzen finished fifth and sixth, with best times two thousandths of a second apart. Irvine was seventh quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher, who focused on qualifying setup. Button and Herbert were ninth and tenth.

==Qualifying==
Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting position determined by their fastest performance. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to achieve a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. Qualifying was held in dry, hot weather, with temperatures periodically rising during the session. Michael Schumacher posted a time of 1:15.632, his fourth pole position of the season and the 27th of his career, around 25 minutes into the session. He was joined on the first row by Coulthard, whose fastest time was 0.102 seconds slower, and drove the spare McLaren vehicle for two laps while the team&#x27;s mechanics replaced a defective fuel pump under the fuel tank. Coulthard was unable to lap quicker after spinning through 180 degrees, and the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) ordered him to undergo a car weight inspection in the pit lane. Barrichello secured third after changing his car&#x27;s set-up in qualifying, which caused uncertainty over ride height changes. Häkkinen was demoted to fourth by Barrichello on the final lap due to difficulty in the slow speed turns from setup problems. Late in qualifying, Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and was pleased with his starting position. He demoted Irvine to sixth place in the final phases of qualifying. Villeneuve qualified seventh.

Jordan&#x27;s Trulli and Frentzen were eighth and ninth. Both drivers were disappointed with their performance; Trulli went wide off the course and returned via the off surface, preventing him from lapping faster. Button qualified tenth. Herbert in eleventh failed to qualify in the top ten by nearly three-tenths of a second. Salo took twelfth, with his fastest time posted when cloud cover reduced air and track temperatures. He was ahead of de la Rosa in 13th position in the quicker of the two Arrows; he electronics system failed, and he returned to the pit lane to drive the spare Arrows car. Fisichella started 14th due to car balance and tyre wear, nearly one-tenth of a second faster than Benetton teammate Alexander Wurz; both drivers reported car grip issues. Pedro Diniz in the other Sauber and Heidfeld split the two. Alesi followed in 18th. Zonta, 19th, used BAR&#x27;s spare car after his racing car&#x27;s engine failed. A lack of grip left Verstappen in 20th. Minardi&#x27;s Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified at the back of the grid in places 21 to 22; both drivers were 2.4 and 2.6 seconds slower than the pole sitter, respectively, Minardi&#x27;s best qualifying performance from first position up to that point in the season.

=== Post-qualifying ===
After qualifying but before the warm-up session, the FIA safety delegate Charlie Whiting announced that he had banned practice starts at the pit lane exit after observing driver behaviour in the area during the Saturday free practice sessions.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session, in sunny weather. Overnight rain left the asphalt surface slippery, but the sun dried it up as the session went; lap time were significantly slower than the previous two days. To begin the session, teams fitted wet tyres on their cars before switching to dry compound tyres when lap times decreased and the circuit&#x27;s condition improved. Drivers modified their car&#x27;s setups and some reported issues. Häkkinen set the fastest time of 1:19.329 with two minutes remaining. Coulthard was second in the other McLaren, with Michael Schumacher third and Trulli fourth. Michael Schumacher drove both the spare and race Ferraris, adjusting settings to the changing track conditions. Some drivers lost control of their cars on the slippery track, and Frentzen damaged a semi-axle by going off the circuit.

==Race==

The 72-lap event had a distance of , and began before 112,112 spectators at 14:00 local time. The weather for the race was dry and sunny; the air temperature ranged from and the track temperature was between ; conditions were expected to remain consistent throughout the race with 40% chance of rain. Every driver began on the Extra Soft dry compound tyres. Driver tyre usage and car setup modifications affected compound wear. &quot;Autosport&quot; wrote that &quot;the key to the French GP was always going to be the start&quot; due to the short pit lane straight leading into a fast left-hand corner rather than having a heavy braking zone. It observed: &quot;For the drivers in the even numbered grid positions, on the inside line, it&#x27;s always a bit difficult. The cars on the outside have a better run at the first turn, and can gain ground by sweeping across in front of those caught on the inside.&quot; Coulthard removed the rear aerofoil tailplane to reduce the effect of an understeer and increase his top speed. 

While Coulthard made the best start of the leading runners, Michael Schumacher moved left and into his path to retain the lead. Coulthard then moved to his right but was blocked and slowed to avoid a collision, allowing Barrichello past for second. Salo had the strongest start in the field, going from twelfth to ninth by the end of the first lap, while Irvine fell four positions and Ralf Schumacher dropped from fifth to seventh. At the first lap&#x27;s completion, the top six drivers were Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Häkkinen, Villeneuve, and Frentzen. Michael Schumacher began to pull away from the field, setting successive fastest laps. Barrichello began delaying the McLaren drivers to help his teammate extend his lead. On lap two, Trulli overtook Ralf Schumacher for seventh and Alesi passed Heidfeld for 14th. On the following lap, Ralf Schumacher retook seventh from Trulli. Heidfeld lost a further position to Fisichella on lap four. Ralf Schumacher began challenging Frentzen for sixth on the fifth lap. 

Michael Schumacher increasing his advantage over Barrichello to five seconds by lap ten. Button took tenth position from Irvine on lap twelve, while Heidfeld collided with Alesi at the Adelaide hairpin while attempting to overtake Fisichella, sending his teammate into a spin and dropping to 18th. Button overtook Salo for ninth on lap 13. Zonta, who was running 17th, experienced braking troubles on lap 17 and struck the tyre barriers, forcing him to retire from the Grand Prix. By the 18th lap, Michael Schumacher had extended his lead over Barrichello to 6.2 seconds, who continued to hold up Coulthard in third. Häkkinen was 1.4 seconds behind his teammate but pulling away from Villeneuve in fifth. Herbert retired three laps later after making an unscheduled pit stop due to a gearbox issue that gradually lost his use of all gears. On the same lap, Alesi became the first driver to pit for tyres. 

Trulli became the first front runner to pit on lap 21, followed by Villeneuve, Frentzen, and Ralf Schumacher. On lap 22, Coulthard passed Barrichello on the outside for second place exiting the Adelaide hairpin. Coulthard entered the hairpin wide and gained enough speed to overtake Barrichello, who did not swerve into him. Häkkinen, Button, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, and Barrichello all made pit stops over the following three laps. Verstappen retired at the side of the pit straight on lap 26 due to gearbox issues. Coulthard was able to close up to Michael Schumacher to less than a second by lap 32, having recorded the race&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:19.479 on the 28th lap; the latter was struggling with his tyres in the warm climate. He on the outside attempted to overtake Michael Schumacher on the inside two laps later but Schumacher defended his position. Coulthard slowed to avoid a collision and gave Michael Schumacher the middle finger in his immediate anger. The manoeuvre allowed Häkkinen to close up on the pair. Mazzacane spun off at the third corner on the previous lap and retired. Wurz&#x27;s brakes locked up entering turn 15, causing him to beach his car in the gravel trap and retire on lap 36. Button became the first driver to pit twice on lap 39. 

Coulthard went to the inside of Michael Schumacher (who had heavily worn tyres) in the Adelaide hairpin as Schumacher steered wide to cover. After forcing Michael Schumacher into the outside verge of the corner exit, he took the lead on lap 40. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s right front wheel made slight contact with Coulthard&#x27;s left rear tyre exiting the hairpin. Michael Schumacher then promptly withstood Häkkinen&#x27;s overtaking attempts. Frentzen and de la Rosa became the next two drivers to make pit stops on the same lap. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen made pit stops for the second time on lap 43 and both emerged in third and fourth respectively. Barrichello&#x27;s pit stop on the 44th lap lasted 16.8 seconds and dropped him to fifth because his team had trouble fitting a cross threaded wheel nut on his right front tyre. This eliminated Barrichello from contention for the victory. De La Rosa retired in the pit lane with transmission failure after completing 45 laps. Coulthard entered the pit lane at the conclusion of the 46th lap for his final 7.9-second pit stop. He rejoined in the lead, three seconds ahead of Michael Schumacher.
After the front-runners finished their pit stops, the first six drivers on lap 48 were Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Villeneuve, and Trulli. On lap 52, towards the back of the field, Gené and Alesi collided, sending both cars spinning sideways. Both drivers maintained their respective positions. Further up, Ralf Schumacher passed Trulli at turn five for sixth. By lap 53, Häkkinen was less than a second behind Michael Schumacher and continued to battle him for second as his tyres degraded faster than the McLarens. Irvine overtook Diniz for twelfth position two laps later. On the 58th lap, Häkkinen was close behind Michael Schumacher and nearly outdragged him at the exit of Lycee corner. Michael Schumacher ran wide to hold off Häkkinen. Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher on lap 59 after the latter drove wide when his rear wheels locked braking for the Adelaide hairpin. Michael Schumacher retired with a sudden engine failure on the same lap. 

Coulthard slowed slightly because he felt his lead was safe. He crossed the finish line in 1&#x27;38:05.538, at an average speed of , for his third victory of the season and eighth of his Formula One career. Häkkinen finished second 14.7 seconds later, ahead of Barrichello in third, Villeneuve in fourth, Ralf Schumacher in five, and Trulli the final points scorer in sixth. Frentzen in seventh held off Button in eighth place who was being closed up to Fisichella in ninth during the race&#x27;s final laps. Salo, Diniz, and Heidfeld followed in the next three positions, with Irvine, Alesi, and Gené the final classified finishers.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers collected their trophies on the podium and spoke at the press conference that followed. Coulthard described his race weekend as &quot;exhausting&quot; due to issues his team had to face. He also apologised for making hand motions at Michael Schumacher during his initial overtaking manoeuvre on him. Häkkinen expressed satisfaction to finish second and applauded his team&#x27;s efforts. He also mentioned watching Michael Schumacher&#x27;s racing lines and believing he might have passed him if he had not retired due to an engine failure. Barrichello said that Ferrari told him to slow in the race&#x27;s closing stages since he had a 35-second lead over Villeneuve.

After Ferrari&#x27;s victory at the previous race, their team principal Jean Todt, said that &quot;we seemed to be in a strong position but, of course, it is the order at the finish that counts&quot;, while Michael Schumacher said that his car&#x27;s tyres dropped in performance following his first pit stop. McLaren technical director Adrian Newey said that the pit stop strategy was crucial in winning the race. He commented: &quot;The tyre wear did not spring any surprises on us and we were able to trust our estimations and co-ordinate the pit-stops to our best advantage.&quot; Villeneuve was happy to finish fourth and was surprised by his good start. Heidfeld, who collided with his teammate Alesi during the race, apologised for the collision. Ralf Schumacher said that he slowed to secure fifth place. Trulli described his race as &quot;difficult&quot; because of the hot temperatures but praised his mechanics for their work.

After the race, Coulthard&#x27;s overtaking manoeuvres on Michael Schumacher drew much media attention. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: &quot;I had a clean run at Michael on the outside and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he has the right to do that because he has track position. I&#x27;m not arguing against that. I just don&#x27;t think Michael is very sporting.&quot; Michael Schumacher later denied any misconduct, citing a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix in which Coulthard pushed him wide with no objections raised. He also admitted to not seeing Coulthard&#x27;s hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes, with a source from Formula One&#x27;s governing body commenting: &quot;It was hard racing – they are racing drivers aren&#x27;t they?&quot; When asked by a journalist if Coulthard&#x27;s gesture was unsporting and gave young racing fans the wrong impression, Mercedes&#x27; head of motorsport Norbert Haug replied: &quot;You don&#x27;t understand, in motor-racing, that is a traditional gesture used to indicate to the driver ahead that you intend to overtake him in one lap&#x27;s time.&quot; According to GrandPrix.com, Coulthard&#x27;s overtake showed that he &quot;is ready to stand up to Michael and is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift.&quot;

FIA president Max Mosley stated that Michael Schumacher&#x27;s single swerving action at the start of the race was &quot;more of a convention&quot; agreed upon by drivers rather than a formal regulation, adding: &quot;They are all grown men at the height of their profession. However, where we would get involved is if the move was totally outrageous and deemed to be dangerous.&quot; Coulthard said he interpreted the regulations to mean that a driver intentionally going across the track to block another racer deserved a penalty or disqualification. He stated that he would raise the subject at the drivers&#x27; meeting prior to the next but not with Michael Schumacher directly. The consequence of the drivers&#x27; meeting was that Michael Schumacher would be allowed to continue swerving to protect the race lead at the start of events after an agreement that would have resulted in a ban on such tactics was not reached when Ralf Schumacher supported his brother.

The race resulted in Coulthard closing the World Drivers&#x27; Championship gap to Michael Schumacher to twelve points. Häkkinen remained third, six points clear of Barrichello. Fisichella remained in fifth place. McLaren&#x27;s one-two finish cut Ferrari&#x27;s lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to six points. Williams had gained two points on Benetton but were still one point behind. Jordan maintained fifth place with eleven points, with eight races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2000 Austrian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Großer A1 Preis von Österreich) was a Formula One motor race held on 16 July 2000, at the A1-Ring near Spielberg, Styria, Austria, attended by 85,112 spectators. The 24th Austrian Grand Prix was the tenth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen won the 71-lap race from pole position, with teammate David Coulthard second and Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello third.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, while his team Ferrari led McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. He started in fourth, alongside teammate Barrichello. BAR&#x27;s Ricardo Zonta collided with Michael Schumacher at the first corner, as five other drivers were involved in incidents during the opening lap. The crash forced Michael Schumacher to retire from the race, and the safety car&#x27;s deployment. Following the withdrawal of the safety car after one lap, Häkkinen and Coulthard pulled away from the rest of the field. When Häkkinen made his first pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard but in front of Barrichello. On lap 43, Coulthard made a pit stop, giving Häkkinen the lead, which he held for the rest of the race to earn his second victory of the 2000 season and his 16th in Formula One.

As a result of the race, Coulthard&#x27;s second-place finish reduced his World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead over Michael Schumacher to six points, while Häkkinen&#x27;s victory brought him within two points of his teammate Coulthard. Following the race, McLaren was deducted ten points for a post-race technical infringement, allowing Ferrari to maintain a four-point lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with seven races remaining.

==Background==
The A1-Ring hosted the tenth round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, the 2000 Austrian Grand Prix, on 16 July 2000. The event featured eleven teams (each representing a different constructor), each with two drivers, with no changes from the season entry list. Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the Soft and Medium dry compound tyres to the event. Before the race, minimal safety upgrades were made to the A1-Ring. New kerbs were erected across the track, with flagstones inside to prevent dust from gathering on the circuit. At each corner, an additional row of tyres was installed to increase absorption in the event of a collision.

Before the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 56 points, followed by McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard on 44 points and his teammate Mika Häkkinen on 38 points. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 32 points and Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth with 18 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 88 points, six points clear of second-placed McLaren. Benetton were third with 18 points, Williams fourth with 17 points, and Jordan fifth with 11 points.

Following the on 2 July, six teams tested at the Silverstone Circuit from 4 to 6 July in preparation for the Austrian Grand Prix at the A1-Ring. On the first day of testing, Heinz-Harald Frentzen led Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz. Alexander Wurz&#x27;s car had a gearbox problem, limiting Benetton&#x27;s testing time. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine was fastest on the second day. Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen was fastest on the final day of testing, although his car&#x27;s front wing was damaged when his engine cover detached from its chassis. Ferrari and McLaren tested at the Mugello Circuit, concentrating on aerodynamic and suspension set-ups between 4 and 7 July. Ferrari spent an extra day at the Fiorano Circuit shaking down their cars with its test driver Luca Badoer. Williams and BAR tested at the Circuito do Estoril from 5 to 7 July, with tyre, engine, aerodynamic and set-up optimisation.

Some teams modified their cars for the event. McLaren brought an extractor profile that had not been utilised in qualifying or the race at the French Grand Prix, as well as a tweaked rear suspension and a new Mercedes-Benz engine. Ferrari tweaked their car&#x27;s aerodynamic profile and continued to test chimney stacks in free practice. BAR completed its package of aerodynamic modifications developed with Honda in a wind tunnel and introduced in France. The Jordan team&#x27;s plan to debut their new car, the EJ10B, in Austria was delayed because its bodywork needed to pass Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) safety tests. Jordan wanted to develop the car further and create more spare parts. However, this was the EJ10&#x27;s final race before the EJ10B débuted at the next race.

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions before Sunday&#x27;s race: two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. Friday&#x27;s practice sessions were held in dry conditions. Within the first five minutes of the first practice session, 17 drivers completed explanatory laps. After 15 minutes, teams determined that there was enough grip for cars to be sent onto the track for examination. Lap times fell as the track&#x27;s conditions improved and drivers re-acquainted themselves with it. Barrichello led the first session at 1:13.603 seconds, soon before the session ended, two-tenths of a second faster than Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli. BAR&#x27;s Ricardo Zonta was third, followed by Verstappen, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Fisichella, Jaguar&#x27;s Johnny Herbert, BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve, and Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo. Häkkinen&#x27;s car had a mechanical fuel pump failure that prompted him to stop at Remus Kurve corner, limiting him to one out lap and was slowest overall.

Coulthard lapped faster each time, setting the day&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:12.464, after running into the gravel during the second practice session. Häkkinen had a trouble free season and was second-fastest. Salo ran quicker during the session and was third-fastest. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello set the fourth and seventh quickest times, separated by Zonta and Trulli. Villeneuve, Diniz, and Fisichella rounded out the top ten. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Williams car stopped five minutes into the session due to an electrical system failure that stalled his engine. Irvine slowed, entered Coulthard&#x27;s path and the two drivers collided.

Irvine withdrew from the event after the second session. When he arrived at the circuit, he felt ill and was diagnosed with suspected appendicitis at the infield medical centre. On the advice of FIA medical delegate Sid Watkins, Irvine went to London for additional surgical consultation. According to hospital tests, Irvine experienced abdominal pain brought on by an enlarged intestine. He was replaced for the rest of the event by Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti. Practice on Saturday morning sessions was held in dry weather, then later on a wet track with low grip, forcing some drivers onto the grass after sliding off the circuit. Häkkinen&#x27;s time of 1:11.355 was the quickest in the third practice session, with Coulthard second. Both Ferrari drivers finished third and fourth, with Barrichello ahead of Michael Schumacher. Verstappen maintained his fast pace, finishing fifth fastest ahead of Fisichella and Villeneuve. Zonta, Trulli, and Herbert were ranked eighth to tenth. Burti was limited to one installation lap and would need to familiarise himself with the course during the final session.

Despite running a wheel on the grass exiting the uphill right-hand Jochen Rindt Kurve corner and getting beached in the gravel trap before the start/finish straight with ten minutes left in the final practice session, Häkkinen set the fastest lap, a 1:11.336, despite a brief heavy rain shower that barely affected proceedings 25 minutes in. His teammate Coulthard remained second-quickest. Michael Schumacher was third-fastest ahead of teammate Barrichello. Villeneuve was fifth-fastest, ahead of Herbert in sixth. Frentzen, seventh, was able to establish a comfortable setup after being one of the slowest drivers in the previous three practice sessions. Salo, Fisichella and Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa made up positions eight to ten. Zonta lost control of his vehicle and reversed back into the path of an incoming driver, who veered onto the grass to avoid him.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force in qualifying, requiring each driver to stay within 107% of the quickest lap time in order to qualify for the race. Qualifying took place in overcast weather, that saw no major incidents. All cars except the Jordans immediately exited the pit lane to set lap times before a brief rainstorm hit sections of the circuit. After 15 minutes, the sun emerged from the clouds, reducing lap times. Häkkinen, after taking time off to de-stress after winning two World Championships, took his fourth pole position of the season, his first since the more than three months earlier, and the 25th of his career with a lap of 1:10.410. Teammate Coulthard joined him on the front row of the starting grid, being outqualifed for the first time since the . Coulthard was three tenths of a second slower than Häkkinen. Coulthard believed he could have fought for pole position but lost time on his penultimate run after clipping a kerb entering Castrol Kurve. Both drivers were satisfied with their car&#x27;s balance. Barrichello qualified third and briefly had pole position while using new tyres before the McLaren drivers recorded their best laps. He said that he altered his car&#x27;s set-up of to enable him to lap faster. Michael Schumacher qualified fourth, six-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, and observed uneven handling throughout the course due to a setup problem. During the session, he also had a high-speed spin at the second corner and aborted his final run after making a mistake at the exit of Gösser corner. Trulli qualified fifth, having set his quickest lap on soft compound tyres and the Jordan team determining no rain delay at the time.

New car aerodynamic packages put Zonta and Villeneuve sixth and seventh respectively, both drivers spun during the session. Fisichella, eighth, lost a bargeboard when he went off the track. He felt he could have started fifth but was slowed by a yellow flag. Salo and Verstappen were ninth and tenth. Diniz missed qualifying in the top ten by two-thousands of a second and spun off while setting lap times, triggering a yellow-flag. De La Rosa, 12th, struggled with the conditions during the session. He qualified ahead of Prost driver Nick Heidfeld and Wurz. Frentzen, 15th, used hard compound tyres and set his laps early in qualifying before track conditions improved. Frentzen explained that he did so because he expected rain near the end of qualifying. Herbert started from 16th after stopping on one run due to a broken left rear suspension caused by a loose suspension bracket at the Niki Lauda Kurve. A back wishbone was also flexing. Jean Alesi qualified his Prost car 17th. Jenson Button, 18th, used the spare Williams car set up for Ralf Schumacher since Button&#x27;s race car experienced an engine failure, balance issues on the low-grip circuit, and slow-speed corners when on the harder tyre compound. Button also had difficulty driving the spare car. Ralf Schumacher, his teammate, qualified 19th, the Williams team&#x27;s worst qualifying performance of the season. The two Minardi drivers of Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane experienced a lack of grip and qualified 20th and 22nd. Burti in 21st separated the two in his first Formula One qualifying session.
===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track in cloudy, dry weather at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Barrichello set the session&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:12.480 with two minutes remaining. Coulthard was second, and his teammate Häkkinen was third after being quickest until Barrichello&#x27;s time. Verstappen finished fourth after leading after 15 minutes. Michael Schumacher was fifth in the other Ferrari. Zonta finished sixth, 1.1 second slower than Barrichello. No major incidents occurred in warm-up. Häkkinen went into the gravel at the final right turn. His teammate Coulthard ran wide at the same corner and slid onto the grass before requiring a new nose cone after colliding with a Jordan car.

==Race==
The race, which commenced before 85,112 spectators at 14:00 local time, lasted 71 laps over . Before the race, the weather was dry and cloudy. The air temperature ranged from with the track temperature between ; weather forecasts indicated a 30% chance of rain. Burti&#x27;s car experienced a sudden drop in water pressure while on a reconnaissance lap, forcing him to start in his team&#x27;s backup car from the pit lane exit. Michael Schumacher also drove his team&#x27;s spare car. When the race began, Häkkinen maintained the lead into the first corner. Coulthard drove alongside his teammate, who was on the outside, but chose to remain second on the dirty inside of the track. The Ferrari duo had slow starts, bunching up the field behind them. Michael Schumacher was on the inside line, with Barrichello on the outside and Zonta close by, but braked alongside Barrichello and compromised his entry to turn one. Barrichello was reportedly instructed to let Schumacher through since his teammate was on a two-stop strategy. McLaren also used team orders, which allowed the driver who entered the first turn first to avoid being challenged.

Further back, Diniz lost control of his car&#x27;s rear after swerving to avoid hitting Verstappen ahead of him. Consequently, Diniz veered right across the track and into Fisichella on the inside at around ; Fisichella veered sharply right into the barrier. Ahead of them, Zonta outbraked himself and slammed into the rear of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s car, sending Schumacher into a 180-degree spin. Schumacher stopped on the kerbs beside the outside grass. Trulli was close behind Barrichello and collided with the Ferrari&#x27;s rear, sending Barrichello onto the gravel to avoid colliding with his teammate. Trulli struck Michael Schumacher&#x27;s right-front suspension. Instead of driving straight, approaching drivers had to decide whether they wanted to steer left or right. Diniz collided with Salo&#x27;s vehicle&#x27;s sidepod when his teammate observed the wreckage and slowed, throwing Diniz into a spin. To avoid a collision, both the BAR and Prost drivers drove onto the gravel. Ralf Schumacher spun and stopped near Diniz and Fisichella&#x27;s stationary vehicles but was able to restart his car and drive away. 

Race director Charlie Whiting decided that the incident did not justify stopping the race and instead deployed the safety car. Michael Schumacher drove onto the centre of the track, anticipating a delay that would allow him to drive the spare car which did not happen. Marshals cleared debris and removed the stricken cars on the outside just off the racing line with recovery vehicles. The safety car was withdrawn at the conclusion of lap two and the race restarted with Häkkinen leading. Verstappen took 15.5 seconds to conduct a pit stop to replace a damaged front wing. Barrichello (nursing a damaged right-rear diffuser) and Frentzen overtook Button who fell to eighth on lap three. At the third lap&#x27;s completion, the race order was Häkkinen, Coulthard, Salo, De La Rosa, Herbert, and Barrichello. Both McLaren drivers began to pull away from the rest of the field and exchanged fastest laps, as De La Rosa passed Salo for third at the start of lap four. Barrichello passed Herbert for fifth on that lap. With an engine failure on lap five, Frentzen&#x27;s Jordan became the race&#x27;s fourth retirement and spun off on oil that was dripping from his car. On the sixth lap, Verstappen set a new fastest lap as he quickly gained on Diniz in 17th place. Alesi overtook his teammate Heidfeld for tenth on the next lap.By the eighth lap, Coulthard and De La Rosa were separated by five seconds because of Häkkinen&#x27;s consistent fastest laps. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop for a new front wing while Barrichello overtook Salo for fourth place on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher entered the garage for repairs to his left-front brake on the following lap. By lap 13, Häkkinen had a two-second lead over Coulthard, who was ten seconds ahead of De La Rosa. Although he was pulling away from Salo in fifth, Barrichello was six seconds behind De La Rosa. Verstappen became the race&#x27;s fifth retirement on lap 15 due to gearbox failure. On lap 16, Diniz and Zonta were given ten-second stop-go penalties, both for their roles in the lap one accidents following a review of television coverage. They took their penalties immediately. Ralf Schumacher emerged from his garage to rejoin the race two laps later. Häkkinen&#x27;s lead over Coulthard was increased to 10.9 seconds by lap 24. Alesi, who was on a two-stop strategy, became the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and exited the pit lane in 13th place. When Zonta attempted to pass Mazzacane at Castrol Kurve corner on lap 25, he collided with him, promoting Diniz to 14th.

By the 30th lap, Häkkinen had a 15.2-second advantage over Coulthard, his teammate, McLaren opted to slightly slow them by displaying pit boards instructing them to reduce their revolutions per minute to preserve their engines. After Arrows noticed unusually high gearbox temperatures on lap 33, De La Rosa retired from third place in the pit lane due to an gearbox oil leak. This moved Button to sixth position. Wurz dropped to tenth after running eighth by lap 34. Häkkinen&#x27;s lead had grown to more than 17 seconds when he made his one and only pit stop on lap 38, emerging in second position. His teammate Coulthard led the next three laps before his sole pit stop on lap 42. Coulthard returned to the track behind Häkkinen, who was quick with a full tank of fuel and wanted to ensure that his teammate was not close enough to challenge for victory. Salo, Herbert, Barrichello, Button and Villeneuve all made pit stops over the next five laps. On lap 43, Alesi, who was 14th but had not yet completed his final pit stop, collided with teammate Heidfeld, and the two retired after an unsuccessful pass. 

At the conclusion of lap 50, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the running order was Häkkinen, Coulthard, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Button, and Salo. Button ran wide challenging Villeneuve for fourth on lap 51 but remained ahead of Salo. On lap 60, Zonta experienced engine overheating issues and retired in the gravel at the Remus Kurve corner. Mazzacane was issued a 10-second stop-go penalty on that lap. He took his penalty on lap 61. Ralf Schumacher spun off the track due to brake failure and retired on the following lap. Coulthard recorded the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:11.783 on lap 66, within nine seconds behind Häkkinen, who was slower on that lap, although it appeared that the latter would win comfortable. Häkkinen increased his lead to 12 seconds to prevent a formation finish, taking his second win of 2000 and 16th overall in 1&#x27;28:15.818, at an average speed of . Coulthard finished second, 12.5 seconds behind, with Barrichello third. Villeneuve finished fourth by staying on the track longer than any other driver and setting quick laps, with Button close behind in fifth. Salo completed the points scorers in sixth. Herbert, Gené, Diniz and Wurz were in the next four positions, albeit one lap behind the winner, with Burti and Mazzacane the final classified finishers.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to receive their trophies and at the following press conference. Häkkinen expressed satisfaction with winning, believing it would help raise his confidence for the rest of the season. Häkkinen said that his team displaying pit boards left him confused whether he had a problem or was being told not to go faster. Coulthard stated that he was satisfied with the outcome of the first lap since it allowed him to race conservatively. He said that finishing second would not cause him to think about his potential of winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Barrichello explained that his car was loose from contact with Trulli early in the race, preventing him from challenging De La Rosa.
Villeneuve was pleased to finish fourth, stating that despite an inclement start, his strategy allowed him to go faster when there were no back markers slowing him. After Button came fifth, the Williams team principal Frank Williams said of his performance, &quot;Jenson really excelled himself again driving in difficult circumstances at the end of the race and under a lot of pressure&quot;. Salo earned his third points of the season after finishing fifth in the . While he was happy, he said he struggled with excess oversteer in the track&#x27;s fast corners. De La Rosa believed he might have reached lap 37 while saving fuel by being on a lean fuel map before retiring. He praised his car and its engine, adding: &quot;It was a shame really, because it would have been good to finish so high.&quot; Both Heidfeld and his Prost teammate Alesi attributed their lap 43 accident to poor communication with their team.

The race should have been stopped, according to Michael Schumacher, who was involved in the first lap incident. He did, however, applaud the marshals who helped recover the cars involved. He also thought Zonta had &quot;overestimated his ability&quot; and promised to have a &quot;quiet word&quot; with him. Zonta believed the incident was not his fault and that Michael Schumacher braked harder than him, although he apologised for retiring from the race. He apologised to Schumacher via fax. Fisichella also agreed that the race should have been stopped, saying, &quot;Three of the protagonists are out and it was stupid not to red flag.&quot; Benetton technical director Pat Symonds was outraged by the driver&#x27;s actions, believing the team had lost vital points in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. He said: &quot;The driving antics of some of our competitors at the first corner were appalling and ruined the race not only for many of the drivers but also for many of the spectators.&quot;

At a routine post-race inspection, the FIA investigated irregularities with Häkkinen&#x27;s car after technical delegate Jo Bauer discovered a missing necessary paper seal on the electronic box. Additional samples from the electronic box (impounded by the FIA&#x27;s technical delegates) were taken following the race; this was software downloaded that found no issues with the FIA&#x27;s software coding. A spokesman for the McLaren team said: &quot;No one changed the software, so there&#x27;s no reason for us to be worried.&quot; The FIA concluded on July 25 that Häkkinen gained no competitive advantage from the missing seal and therefore Häkkinen&#x27;s victory stood. McLaren, on the other hand, was deducted 10 points and fined $50,000 for violating Article 7 of the 2000 Formula One Sporting Regulations, which stipulated that competitors had to maintain some safety and eligibility criteria during the event. McLaren did not appeal the penalty, and managing director Martin Whitmarsh stated, &quot;We now consider the matter closed.&quot; Norbert Haug, vice-president of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, criticised the decision and believed that the seal was never applied to Häkkinen&#x27;s car. Haug also said that he would not pursue the matter further.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship decreased to six points as a result. Coulthard was second with 50 points, two more than teammate Häkkinen and eight more than Barrichello. Fisichella retained fifth with 18 points despite not finishing. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari maintained their lead with 92 points, while McLaren&#x27;s 10-point penalty kept them second with 88 points. Williams moved third on 19 points, pushing Benetton into fourth on 18 points, and BAR overtook Jordan for fifth on 12 points, with seven rounds remaining in the season.

<text>Everett M. &quot;Ev&quot; Rogers (March 6, 1931 – October 21, 2004) was an American communication theorist and sociologist, who originated the &quot;diffusion of innovations&quot; theory and introduced the term &quot;early adopter&quot;. He was distinguished professor emeritus in the department of communication and journalism at the University of New Mexico.

==Education and career==
Rogers was born on his family&#x27;s Pinehurst Farm in Carroll, Iowa, in 1931. His father loved electromechanical farm innovations, but was highly reluctant to utilize biological–chemical innovations, so he resisted adopting the new hybrid seed corn, even though it yielded 25% more crop and was resistant to drought. During the Iowa drought of 1936, while the hybrid seed corn stood tall on the neighbor&#x27;s farm, the crop on the Rogers&#x27; farm wilted. Rogers&#x27; father was finally convinced.

Rogers had no plans to attend university until a school teacher drove him and some classmates to Ames to visit Iowa State University. Rogers decided to pursue a degree there. He received a B.S. in agriculture in 1952. He then served in the Korean War for two years (1952–1954). He returned to Iowa State University to earn a M.S. in 1955 and a Ph.D. in 1957 both in rural sociology. 

Rogers held faculty positions at Ohio State University (1957–63), Michigan State University (1964–1973), and the University of Michigan (1973–1975). He was the Janet M. Peck Professor of International Communication at Stanford University (1975–1985) and the Walter H. Annenberg Professor and associate dean for doctoral studies in the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California (1985–1993).

As Fulbright Lecturer, Rogers taught the National University of Colombia in Bogotá (1963–1964) and at the University of Paris in France (1981). He was also distinguished visiting professor at New Mexico State University (1977), visiting professor at Ibero-American University in Mexico (1979), Ludwig Erhard Professor at the University of Bayreuth in Germany (1996), Wee Kim Wee Professor (1998) and Nanyang Professor (2000–2001) at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University (1999–2000). He served as president of the International Communication Association (1980–1981) and fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California (1991–1992).

In 1993, Rogers moved to the University of New Mexico as chair of the department of communication and journalism. He had become fond of Albuquerque while he was stationed at an airbase during the Korean War. He helped the UNM launch a doctoral program in communication with a special emphasis on cross-cultural and intercultural contexts. Rogers suffered from kidney disease and retired from the UNM in the summer of 2004. He died a few months later, survived by his wife, Dr. Corinne Shefner-Rogers, and two sons: David Rogers and Everett King. During his 47-year academic career, Rogers authored more than 30 books and over 500 articles.

==Diffusion of innovations==

When the first edition of &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot; was published in 1962, Rogers was an assistant professor of rural sociology at Ohio State University. He was 31 years old and becoming a renowned academic figure. In the mid-2000s, &quot;The Diffusion of Innovations&quot; became the second most-cited book in the social sciences. (Arvind Singhal: &quot;Introducing Professor Everett M. Rogers, 47th Annual Research Lecturer, University of New Mexico&quot;) . The fifth edition (2003, with Nancy Singer Olaguera) addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas.

Rogers proposes that adopters of any new innovation or idea can be categorized as innovators (2.5%), early adopters (13.5%), early majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%), based on the mathematically based Bell curve. These categories, based on standard deviations from the mean of the normal curve, provide a common language for innovation researchers. Each adopter&#x27;s willingness and ability to adopt an innovation depends on their awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption. People can fall into different categories for different innovations—a farmer might be an early adopter of mechanical innovations, but a late majority adopter of biological innovations or VCRs.

When graphed, the rate of adoption formed what came to typify the Diffusion of Innovations model, a sigmoid curve. The graph shows a cumulative percentage of adopters over time–slow at the start, more rapid as adoption increases, then leveling off until only a small percentage of laggards have not adopted.

His research and work became widely accepted in communications and technology adoption studies, and also found its way into a variety of other social science studies. Rogers was also able to relate his communications research to practical health problems, including hygiene, family planning, cancer prevention, and drunk driving.

==Entertainment education==
In the early 1990s Rogers turned his attention to the field of Entertainment-Education. With funding from Population Communications International, he evaluated a radio drama designed to improve public health in Tanzania called &quot;Twende na Wakati&quot; (Let&#x27;s Go With the Times). With Arvind Singhal of Ohio University he co-wrote &quot;Entertainment Education: A Communication Strategy for Social Change.&quot;

To commemorate his contributions to the field, the University of Southern California&#x27;s Norman Lear Center established the Everett M. Rogers Award for Achievement in Entertainment-Education, which recognizes outstanding practice or research in the field of entertainment education.

<doc id="1123402" wikidata="Q173141" url="?curid=1123402" title="2000 German Grand Prix">
<text>The 2000 German Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland 2000) was a Formula One motor race contested on 30 July 2000, at the Hockenheimring in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, in front of 102,000 people. It was the 62nd German Grand Prix and the 11th round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello won the 45-lap race after starting 18th. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen finished second, with teammate David Coulthard third.

Before the race, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Coulthard began alongside Michael Schumacher on pole position after qualifying fastest. Coulthard&#x27;s teammate Häkkinen started fourth. At the first corner, Michael Schumacher moved to the left, colliding with Giancarlo Fisichella, and both drivers retired. Häkkinen took the race lead, which he retained until lap 25 when an intruder breached circuit limits, forcing drivers to pit under safety car conditions. Meanwhile, until the first safety car period, Barrichello had gained thirteen positions to fifth. After Coulthard&#x27;s stop on lap 27, Häkkinen reclaimed the lead. Barrichello stayed out on dry slick tyres, grabbing the lead and retaining it to claim his maiden Formula One victory. It was also the first Formula One victory for a Brazilian driver since Ayrton Senna won the 1993 Australian Grand Prix.

Barrichello&#x27;s victory was widely celebrated among the Formula One paddock as it came after a career setback. The race result tied Häkkinen and Coulthard for second, but it decreased Schumacher&#x27;s points lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to two. Barrichello trailed the McLaren drivers by eight points. With six races remaining in the season, McLaren was four points behind Ferrari and 76 points ahead of Williams in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. The track intruder, named as 47-year-old Frenchman Robert Sehli, eventually apologised and was fined by track administration.

==Background==
On 30 July 2000, the eleventh of seventeen rounds of the 2000 Formula One World Championship was held at the clockwise Hockenheimring near the town of Hockenheim in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. There were eleven teams (each representing a different constructor), each with two drivers and were the same as those on the season entry list. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone provided soft and medium dry tyre compounds, as well as intermediate and full wet-weather compounds to the race.

Before the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 56 points, followed by McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard and teammate Mika Häkkinen with 50 and 48 points, respectively. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 36 points, while Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth with 18 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 92 points, McLaren and Williams were second and third with 88 and 19 points, respectively, Benetton was fourth with 18 points, and BAR was fifth with 12 points.

Following the on 16 July, the teams tested at three circuits from 18 to 21 July to prepare for the event. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren&#x27;s test driver, led testing&#x27;s first day. Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti damaged his car&#x27;s suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod in an accident at Stowe corner. Testing was briefly stopped and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day&#x27;s testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Jarno Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team&#x27;s testing time. Burti&#x27;s right rear wheel detached. Fisichella led the third and final day&#x27;s running. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit focused on engine and aerodynamic development, while Michael Schumacher did practice starts and component testing on the fourth day.

Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine Jaguar was passed fit in the days before to the race. He arrived at the previous race ill with suspected appendicitis and withdrew at the conclusion of the Friday practice sessions. Burti replaced him. Irvine was later admitted to a London hospital and diagnosed with a swollen intestine. Irvine said he felt ready to race again: &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to Hockenheim. I have been keeping tabs on the team&#x27;s Silverstone test this week and we&#x27;re all encouraged by what has been achieved.&quot;

Teams setup their cars for the long straights of the Hockenheimring circuit, necessitateing reducing aerodynamic downforce and increasing aerodynamic efficiency. The Jaguar team included multiple characteristics in its cars. It replaced the huge panels mounted behind the front wheels with smaller screens mounted between the suspension. They also returned to the bodywork seen at the and installed a new uprated Cosworth engine. Jordan&#x27;s new car, the EJ10B, was also introduced that weekend; the team had previously raced with their primary 2000 car, the EJ10. Originally scheduled to debut at the previous race in Austria, the vehicle was required to complete  Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) safety tests on its bodywork and Jordan wished to create extra spare components for the EJ10B, postponing the car&#x27;s race début.

==Practice==
Two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday preceded Sunday&#x27;s race. The Friday practices were held in dry, cloudy weather, becoming damp during the day, making the track slippery. Michael Schumacher set the first session&#x27;s fastest time of 1:43.532, almost six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello was third, slightly behind Häkkinen, with Coulthard fourth; both Barrichello and Coulthard led during the session. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen, BAR driver Ricardo Zonta, Fisichella, Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo, Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher and Herbert rounded out the top ten. Few incidents occurred during practice as some drivers went off the circuit. Trulli&#x27;s engine failed after 20 minutes at the Ostkurve turn and marshals relocated his car with yellow flags. Jenson Button spun and slammed against the inside barriers at the pit lane entry after practice ended and rain fell, removing his car&#x27;s front wing.

Heavy rain made the track wet and dusty, slowing lap times in the second practice session. The slick surface and wet-weather tyres become familiar to drivers. After nearly three-quarters of the session had passed and the track dried, competitive lap times began to be set.Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lap time did not improve, but remained the fastest. Frentzen lapped quicker and was second-fastest. Although both McLaren drivers were testing race set-up and brake performance, Häkkinen finished third and Coulthard fifth. Barrichello separated them. Trulli, Zonta, Villeneuve, Fisichella, and Salo completed the top ten. Several drivers entered the gravel traps during the session. The two Minardi drivers crashed. Gastón Mazzacane hit the barrier in the stadium section and Marc Gené beached his car in the last turn&#x27;s gravel trap. Ralf Schumacher missed half of the session as his team switched the engine in his car.

The Saturday morning sessions were held in damp weather with occasional rain. Most of practice saw the circuit dry with sunlight appearing through the clouds. Häkkinen set the third session&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:44.144, one-tenth of a second quicker than Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa. Coulthard, Frentzen, Salo. Trulli, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, Villeneuve and Fisichella completed the top ten. Ralf Schumacher, who completed just one lap in the session&#x27;s second half, lost control of his car after crossing the start/finish line on a damp area and hit the turn one tyre barrier as the racing line began drying. Jean Alesi simultaneously beached his Prost car in the gravel due to a rear suspension failure on the damp circuit.

The track became completely dry during the last practice session and lap times fell as drivers found more grip on it. Nearly every driver exited the pit lane in the first minutes, giving teams a final chance to significantly adjust their cars before qualifying. Häkkinen set the day&#x27;s quickest time, a 1:41.658, with 15 minutes remaining; his teammate Coulthard finished third. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello were second and fourth, respectively. Frentzen fell to fifth, with Fisichella, sixth, pleased with the feel of his car. Button, Salo, Villeneuve, and Trulli were seventh to tenth. Fisichella&#x27;s car billowed smoke because of an engine failure in the final seconds at the North Kurve turn. Michael Schumacher went backwards into the Opel Kurve corner wall in the stadium section after the session. Schumacher drove the spare Ferrari in qualifying.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order determined by the fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, requiring each driver to lap within 107% of the fastest time to qualify for the race. The session was held in damp weather with intermittent rain; drivers used grooved and wet-weather compound tyres with drivers initially hesitant to go onto the track. With a lap time of 1:45.697 set on his first try, Coulthard earned his second pole position of the season after the and 10th overall. Michael Schumacher joined him on the front row, 1.3 seconds slower than Coulthard but three-tenths of a second faster than his previous best lap to move from fourth to second. Fisichella qualified third in a spare Benetton car with incorrect gear ratios. He spun on his first run but retained second until Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lap as the rain stopped. Fisichella was fined $5,000 for failing to place his car at the pit-lane weighbridge so that the FIA could check if it was within the legal minimum weight limit. Häkkinen, who qualified fourth, three hundredths of a second slower than Fisichella, admitted he was cautious about going off the track owing to the weather. In his then-career-best qualifying performance, De La Rosa took fifth in the spare Arrows car while his race car was being prepared. Trulli and Wurz were satisfied to qualify sixth and seventh. Herbert was the quicker Jaguar driver in eighth. Villeneuve secured ninth in BAR&#x27;s spare car after losing control of his car and stalling at the Jim Clark chicane, disrupting Frentzen&#x27;s running. Irvine, tenth, was slowed by Gené midway attempting to lap quicker.

Jos Verstappen had engine starting problems, resulting in Arrows removing the car&#x27;s floor to install a starter. A lack of qualifying laps for Verstappen left him 11th. Zonta, 12th, used a new engine and was impeded by Alesi at the final chicane in the stadium area. He was ahead of Alesi&#x27;s teammate Nick Heidfeld in 13th whose lap was set simultaneously as Fisichella. Ralf Schumacher, 14th, outpaced teammate Jenson Button, 16th; the change in weather caught Williams out. They were separated by Salo in 15th, who encountered two cars on his first fast lap and was slowed by the weather. Frentzen, 17th, spent most of qualifying 107 per cent outside of the quickest lap; the stewards disallowed his first quick lap when he cut the first chicane in his attempt to find room and pass two slower vehicles to lap faster and avoid being hampered by aerodynamic turbulence. Barrichello, 18th, used his teammate&#x27;s repaired race car after his vehicle developed oil-leak issues; his mechanics adjusted the settings of his pedals to suit Barrichello&#x27;s right-footed braking style before he could drive. Barrichello was also asked to park at the weighbridge for car weight checks. Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz, 19th, lost time amongst slower cars, with Alesi 20th and Mazzacane 21st. Mazzacane&#x27;s teammate Gené in 22nd incorrectly used wet-weather tyres and abandoned his car on the track with a gearbox fault; he drove the spare Minardi car.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

The drivers took to the track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (GMT+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Ten minutes in, Coulthard lapped fastest at 1:44.065; Häkkinen was second in the other McLaren, followed by De La Rosa and Michael Schumacher. Villeneuve and Verstappen collided at the Jim Clark chicane during their installation lap just as warm-up started. Yellow flags were waved because both Villeneuve and Verstappen&#x27;s cars were stationary and obstructing much of the track. Verstappen sustained multiple arm abrasions. Coulthard spun backwards into the tyre wall at the stadium section&#x27;s final double right-hand turn after drifting wide onto dust. He damaged his car&#x27;s front wing, and returned to the pit lane to drive the spare McLaren. When Heidfeld&#x27;s engine cover detached into the Ostkurve corner, littering the circuit with carbon fibre debris, waved yellow flags were once again required. De La Rosa suffered a right-rear tyre puncture after driving over some carbon fibre debris and stopped on the side of the circuit. He was unhurt.

==Race==
The 45-lap race ran before 102,000 spectators over from 14:00 local time. The race began in dry weather, but became damp and wet as it progressed. The air temperature was and the track temperature ranged from . Rain began falling in the stadium section eleven minutes before the parade lap, but it ceased eight minutes later. Ferrari adjusted the angle of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s front wing to better cope with wet weather that the team expected. Several drivers adjusted their rear wings, slowing them slightly but improving their steering in tight corners. Button&#x27;s engine suddenly failed to start during the parade lap, forcing him to start from the back of the field. When the race began, Coulthard and Michael Schumacher made slow starts. Coulthard steered hard right to obstruct Michael Schumacher&#x27;s path, allowing teammate Häkkinen to veer left and take the lead. Noticing Häkkinen to his left, Michael Schumacher moved to the outside line, and his left-rear wheel and Fisichella&#x27;s front wing collided after catching Fisichella off guard and his braking late. Both drivers ran off the track, struck the turn one tyre barrier and retired from the race. The safety car was not deployed since both cars were far off the track.

Barrichello, on a two-stop strategy making his car light, moved from 18th to 10th to end lap one. At the first lap&#x27;s completion, Häkkinen led from Coulthard, Trulli, De La Rosa, Irvine, Herbert, and Verstappen. Häkkinen began to maintain his lead from teammate Coulthard. Herbert moved into fifth place after Irvine fell to seventh after Verstappen overtook him for sixth on lap two. Barrichello advanced further up the field, passing both BAR drivers for eighth. The McLaren drivers maintained their gap over Trulli, who set the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:46.321. Irvine lost another place to Barrichello on lap three following a short battle, as Frentzen took 14th from Diniz. On lap four, Frentzen passed Heidfeld for 13th. On the same lap Verstappen locked up his tyres to avoid hitting Herbert. This allowed Barrichello to pass Verstappen for sixth into the Jim Clark chicane on lap five, as the Arrows vehicle suffered with braking into the chicanes. On lap six, Herbert lost fifth to Barrichello, while Frentzen gained more places, passing Ralf Schumacher and Wurz for 11th.

Barrichello began setting successive fastest laps, closing up to De La Rosa. Frentzen overtook Zonta for tenth on lap seven. On the next lap, Verstappen&#x27;s engine cover detached from the chassis as Frentzen advanced four spots over the next four laps. Further down, Ralf Schumacher overtook Zonta for 11th and Diniz passed teammate Salo for 14th. By lap 11, Barrichello had caught De La Rosa and passed him for fourth a lap later. Frentzen began pressuring De La Rosa. Herbert retired at the side of the track with clutch failure on lap 13. Two laps later, braking for the Jim Clark chicane, Barrichello passed Trulli for third. Barrichello was the first driver to make a pit stop, entering the pit lane for the first of two planned stops at the end of lap 17 (7.2 seconds). He rejoined the circuit in sixth place. Frentzen stopped one lap later and fell to sixth, behind Barrichello. By lap 20, Häkkinen had a 1.4-second advantage over Coulthard, who was nearly 22 seconds ahead of Trulli. De La Rosa was 2.1 seconds behind Trulli and was being caught by Barrichello, who recorded a new fastest lap of 1:44.300. Villeneuve passed Irvine for eighth on lap 22.
On lap 25, a man wearing a white raincoat with French writing critical of Mercedes-Benz appeared from beside the barriers and stepped onto the outside edge towards the Ostkurve. To avoid being apprehended by marshals, he ran in front of a group of cars approaching him at high speed to the inside of the track. The incident prompted race officials to deploy the safety car and the field closed up. As the pit stop window approached, teams rushed their drivers into the pit lane to take advantage of the situation, with Trulli and De La Rosa being the first to stop. Both Häkkinen and Coulthard had passed the pit lane following the safety car&#x27;s deployment. At the end of lap 26, McLaren called Häkkinen to the pit lane. Coulthard stayed out on worn tyres due to radio communication uncertainty about whether he should have entered the pit lane. Coulthard would stop on the following lap and fell to sixth. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. The safety car period benefited those who had stopped before it was deployed.

Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car entered the pit lane. Trulli was immediately put under pressure by Barrichello and resisted his attempts to pass him. On lap 30, Ralf Schumacher spun at the Jim Clark chicane, forcing Verstappen wide. Later, on the approach to the Ayrton Senna chicane, Diniz made a mistake under braking as attempted to pass Alesi and went across him at high speed. Alesi crashed into the barrier at high speed, removing his car&#x27;s left-hand side wheels. Diniz&#x27;s car was not damaged. Alesi suffered from abdominal pains, dizziness and vomiting. Officials again deployed the safety car as carbon fibre was scattered across the grass and needed removing by marshals. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of the 31st lap, and the race resumed with Häkkinen leading.

Salo avoided colliding with the slow to react Wurz on the start/finish straight, sending Wurz spinning onto the grass. Although Wurz&#x27;s car stopped at the side of the track with a gearbox jam, marshals were able to move it away and racing continued without the need for a third safety car period due to the Hockenheimring&#x27;s length. Light rain began to fall in the stadium on lap 32 and on other parts of the circuit a lap later. On the following lap, Button was the first driver to pit, and his Williams pit crew swapped his dry tyres to wets. With a failed engine and oil on the track on lap 34, Gené became the race&#x27;s seventh retirement. The rain had intensified on that lap and became a downpour in the stadium section on lap 35. Villeneuve spun after making minor contact with teammate Zonta&#x27;s rear exiting the first turn on that lap but continued racing.

All drivers, apart from Barrichello, Coulthard, Frentzen and Zonta, made pit stops for wet-weather tyres. After technical director Ross Brawn informed Barrichello of Häkkinen&#x27;s final pit stop, the two agreed he could stay on the track. They believed that because the rain had not reached the track&#x27;s outer edge, grooved tyres could still allow for fast laps. Brawn obtained information indicating that Barrichello might lap faster than wet-weather shod cars. Häkkinen lapped the wet stadium section three seconds faster than the circumspect Barrichello. Häkkinen lost most of his advantage through the dry chicanes, which gave his wet-weather tyres little grip. Trulli was imposed a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 37 when marshals reported him for passing Barrichello, who had just exited the pit lane after the first turn. He took the penalty immediately and fell to 11th. Zonta was also penalised, but he crashed into the tyre wall at the Sachs hairpin because he was distracted by a radio communication telling him of the penalty. Frentzen pressured Coulthard who made a driving error and cut the Jim Clark chicane on lap 38. Coulthard became the final driver to make a pit stop on the same lap but his team were not ready for him, dropping to fifth. Button then passed De La Rosa for sixth.

At the completion of lap 39, with the pit stops completed, the top six were Barrichello, Häkkinen, Frentzen, Salo, Coulthard, and Button. Frentzen retired with gearbox failure at the start/finish straight on lap 40 as Coulthard overtook Salo for third. Heidfeld became the race&#x27;s final retirement owing to alternator failure on lap 40. Rain returned two laps later. Button caught Salo on lap 43 and made an aggressive pass for fourth. By lap 44, it began raining more heavily, but Barrichello held on to win his first Formula One race and the first for a Brazilian driver since Ayrton Senna in the 1993 Australian Grand Prix in a time of 1&#x27;25:34.418. at an average speed of . Häkkinen finished 7.4 seconds behind Barrichello, with his teammate Coulthard third. Button finished fourth, his season-best finish, ahead of Salo in fifth and De La Rosa the final points-scorer in sixth. Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, Trulli, Irvine and Mazzacane filled the next five positions, with Heidfeld the final classified driver despite his alternator failure. Verstappen, the other race retirement, spun into the gravel trap in the stadium section after 39 laps.

==Post-race==
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Barrichello&#x27;s first win was widely celebrated among spectators and team personnel, because it came after an earlier setback, including a major accident during practice for the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix that rendered him unconscious. Barrichello dedicated his victory to Senna, who had assisted him in his early career. He also disclosed that he chose to race on dry tyres because he believed he would have an advantage on the straights and chicanes, even though he flat-spotted a tyre in the race&#x27;s closing stages, reducing his visibility. Häkkinen stated that he was &quot;in control&quot; of the event throughout the first phase, while he confessed that he was careful on wet tyres and could have won on dry tyres. Coulthard revealed that he used Michael Schumacher&#x27;s tactics at the start after seeking clarity on the rules governing such manoeuvres. He also said that he was unable to communicate with his team in the forest portions, which prompted him to stay out for an extra lap after Häkkinen&#x27;s pit stop.

Button was overjoyed with his then-career-best fourth and congratulated his team for timing the switch to wet-weather tyres. Salo regarded his race as &quot;hard&quot; because he chose a high downforce setup, which meant he was slower than his competitors on the straights. Furthermore, he revealed that near the end of the race, he ran out of engine oil as temperatures gradually rose. De La Rosa earned points for the second time this season after finishing fifth at the European Grand Prix. He thought the event was &quot;strange,&quot; but was happy with his team&#x27;s efforts. Michael Schumacher, who retired on the first lap after colliding with Fisichella, blamed Fisichella for the incident. &quot;I am out of the race not because of David (Coulthard) but because of Fisichella.&quot; he said. Fisichella, conversely, maintained his racing line and believed that drivers should choose their preferred racing line before describing his race as a &quot;waste.&quot; Schumacher&#x27;s manager Willi Weber rejected reports the crash was part of a conspiracy.

The majority of media attention, however, was focussed on the intruder who penetrated the circuit&#x27;s barriers on lap 25. He was identified as Robert Sehli, a 47-year-old French father of three who spent 22 years working at a Mercedes-Benz production factory in Le Mans. The news reported that Sehli was protesting his dismissal on health grounds. Additional information revealed that he planned to protest 15 seconds before the start of the formation lap but marshals stopped this by dragging him off the circuit. Sehli had attempted to do something similar at the before being stopped in the pit lane ten laps before the race ended by the FIA Photographers&#x27; Delegate. He was released on a DM 2,000 ($945) bail the Monday after the event. Retired Formula One driver Hans-Joachim Stuck said that Sehli had &quot;succeeded in avenging himself on Mercedes.&quot; Brawn said that Sehli&#x27;s actions were &quot;very, very dangerous&quot; and that similar intrusions &quot;should never be allowed to happen again.&quot; However, Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice president Norbert Haug called the police&#x27;s treatment of Sehli a &quot;scandal.&quot; Hockenheimring GmbH, the track&#x27;s owners, reported that Sehli had been charged with trespassing. Mercedes-Benz would compensate him and he apologised for the track invasion. On 16 December, Sehli won a court battle against Mercedes-Benz, which was compelled to pay F91,000 for &quot;dismissing him without any conclusive reasons.&quot; Hockenheimring GmbH, however, fined him £600 for breaching circuit limits. 

The race result cut Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to two points. Häkkinen moved into second place, level on points with teammate Coulthard; both were eight points ahead of Barrichello, with Fisichella remained a distant fifth with 18 points. McLaren cut Ferrari&#x27;s lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to four points. Williams expanded their lead over Benetton to four points with 22 points, while BAR maintained fifth with 12 points with six races remaining.

<text>The 2000 Hungarian Grand Prix (formally the XVI Marlboro Magyar Nagydj) was a Formula One motor race held on 13 August 2000, at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary, attended by 120,000 spectators. The race was the twelfth of seventeen in the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the 18th in Hungary. Mika Häkkinen, driving a McLaren-Mercedes, won the 77-lap race after starting third. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher finished second after qualifying on pole position in the one-hour qualifying session the day before the race. Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard finished third.

Before the race, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from Häkkinen, while Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship from McLaren. Häkkinen overtook Schumacher and Coulthard at the start and led every lap save the first round of pit stops. He won by eight seconds, with Schumacher holding off Coulthard for second. The win, Häkkinen&#x27;s third of the season and his 17th in Formula One, moved him to the World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead for the first time in 2000, two points ahead of Schumacher and six points ahead of Coulthard, while McLaren took the World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead from Ferrari by one point with five of the season&#x27;s races remaining.

==Background==
On 13 August 2000, the 3.975 km (2.470 mi) clockwise Hungaroring in Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary hosted the twelfth race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, the 2000 Hungarian Grand Prix. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone delivered the Soft and Extra Soft dry compound tyres to the event, the softest compounds available to teams. Entering the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 56 points, ahead of McLaren teammates Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard, who were tied for second on 54 points. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 46 points, while Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth with 18 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 102 points, four more than second-placed McLaren. Williams was third with 22 points, with Benetton fourth with 18 points. BAR were sixth with 12 points.

Following the on 30 July, teams prepared for the event by testing on circuits similar to the Hungaroring. Six teams tested at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo from 3 to 5 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis finished the first day ahead of Häkkinen. Pedro Diniz&#x27;s Sauber car had an oil leak, restricting his team&#x27;s testing time while the leak was rectified. Coulthard was fastest on the second day and Fisichella led on the final day. Benetton&#x27;s Alexander Wurz spun and struck the tyre barrier. His car&#x27;s wishbone hit his right leg, and he was taken to the circuit&#x27;s medical centre before being transferred to a local hospital. Wurz was passed fit to compete in the race the day after his accident. Ferrari tested for five days at the Fiorano Circuit, focusing on car development, practice starts, aerodynamic testing and race distance simulations with test driver Luca Badoer. He was joined by Barrichello on the second day and Michael Schumacher from the fourth day onwards. Badoer and Michael Schumacher spent two more days at the circuit shaking down the Ferrari F1-2000 car.

After three consecutive retirements, including first-lap collisions in Austria and Germany reducing his points lead from 22 points to 2, Michael Schumacher stated that his objective in Hungary was to avoid any incident on the first lap and finish in a points-scoring position. He was also confident that Ferrari would perform well on the track. Despite Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo&#x27;s comments to the press about Barrichello assisting Michael Schumacher&#x27;s title aspirations, Barrichello revealed that he received backing from him to challenge for more victories and the championship.

The event featured eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) and two drivers, with no changes from the season entry list. Following tests, Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi was declared fit by his doctors and then by FIA medical delegate Sid Watkins in the days before the race. At the previous race, Alesi was involved in a high-speed accident with Sauber driver Diniz, suffering from abdominal pains, dizziness and vomiting. Prost had their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin ready if Alesi relapsed. Alesi said he felt ready to race again: &quot;It took a few days before I really started to recover, but now I sleep and feel much better&quot;.

Some teams modified their cars for the event. The Hungaroring track&#x27;s characteristics require teams to operate their car with a high load of aerodynamics, and special attention was paid to heat dissipation because high temperatures were recorded at the circuit. McLaren improved the aerodynamics of their MP4/15 chassis in order to increase the amount of downforce, and thus grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. McLaren additionally strengthened the steel rear suspension wishbones. BAR outfitted their cars with one-off components designed to improve the performance of the monocoque&#x27;s cooling systems. Ferrari debuted an aerodynamic setup similar to that used at the , as well as a modified version of the F1-2000&#x27;s chimneys. Minardi arrived with redesigned radiator intakes and exits to address temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.

==Practice==
Before Sunday&#x27;s race, there were two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday practice sessions took place in dry, hot weather; when clouds obscured the track, the temperature dropped, but the ambient temperature remained constant. Before any lap times were set nearly 20 minutes, 15 drivers completed out-laps to allow them to perform system checks. The track was dirty due to a lack of activity for several months, and race organisers were unable to completely clean it.

Michael Schumacher waited for other drivers to clean the dirty track before setting the first session&#x27;s quickest time on his first fast lap, at 1 minute and 20.198 seconds, in the final moments of the session. He was almost six-tenths of a second faster than teammate Barrichello. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine was third fastest, ahead of Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher. Fisichella, BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve, Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Diniz, Mika Salo of Sauber and Williams&#x27; Jenson Button completed the top ten. McLaren sat out first practice, preferring to save tyres. Several teams concentrated on testing the high downforce aerodynamic packages fitted to their cars during the session.

Coulthard set the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:18.792 with about 15 minutes left in the second practice session; the time was half a second slower than teammate Häkkinen&#x27;s pole lap at the 1999 race. Häkkinen was second, Michael Schumacher third and Barrichello fourth. Trulli was faster, finishing fifth fastest, ahead of Fisichella and Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Button. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Irvine completed the top ten. Several drivers lost control of their cars during the session due to the low grip racing surface appearing to be problematic for racers. Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa was unhurt in an accident against the tyre wall.

The weather remained dry, hot and sunny for the two Saturday practice sessions, with no indication of rain when the third session began. With three minutes remaining in the third practice session, Barrichello set a time of 1:18.268. Coulthard was second, a thousandth of a second slower than Barrichello. Frentzen was third, ahead of Michael Schumacher in fourth and Häkkinen and Ralf Schumacher in fifth and sixth, respectively. Salo, Button, Trulli, and Fisichella completed the top ten. Three minutes in, De La Rosa almost lost control of his car at the final corner and Gastón Mazzacane&#x27;s Minardi engine failed due to a differential fault.

The final practice session took place on a marginally drier but still dusty circuit than the previous session. Teams were finalising car setups and scrubbing tyres. Michael Schumacher was quicker than the day before, lapping 1:17.395 with 20 minutes of the season remaining. He was 0.630 seconds faster than second-placed Coulthard with Barrichello in the second Ferrari third. Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Häkkinen, Trulli, Fisichella, Salo and Diniz followed in positions four to ten. Diniz was briefly stuck at the pit lane entry as his engine stalled in first gear.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. The session took place in dry and clear weather, similar to practice, but with a warmer track temperature. The warm weather made the track more slippery. Most of the faster teams used new rear tyres and front scrubbed compounds to reduce understeer when lapping quickly. Michael Schumacher qualified on pole position for the 28th time in his career, and fifth of the season, with a lap of 1:17.514, on his first fast lap midway through qualifying. Coulthard, who was 0.372 seconds slower on his third and final run, joined Michael Schumacher on the grid&#x27;s front row. McLaren did not optimise Coulthard&#x27;s vehicle for low fuel, and it oversteered in the circuit&#x27;s first two sectors. Häkkinen, third, made considerable car setup alterations by altering the rear anti-roll bar and front torsion beams, which he tested early in qualifying to see if it improved his performance. Ralf Schumacher qualified fourth with the newer Williams qualifying engine, his season-best qualifying result. He was satisfied with revisions to his car&#x27;s aerodynamics. Barrichello, fifth, had car handling difficulties and said Coulthard prevented him from lapping faster. Frentzen, sixth, had excess oversteer in the track&#x27;s final two sectors. 

Fisichella qualified seventh, claiming Michael Schumacher hindered his final lap. Ferrari attempted to inform Schumacher about Fisichella behind him but Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn pressed the wrong radio button and mistakenly told Barrichello. Brawn apologised for the error and Benetton technical director Pat Symonds downplayed it. Button was the slower of the two Williams drivers in eighth. Salo finished ninth, owing to cloud cover on his final run. Irvine finished tenth. Wurz, 11th, failed to reach the top-ten by two-tenths of a second after switching to his teammate Fisichella&#x27;s setup. Trulli qualified 12th after experiencing oversteer that could not be corrected by car component and setup tweaks. He was ahead of Diniz in 13th, who was hindered by traffic and had car setup problems. Alesi was the faster of the two Prost drivers in 14th. De La Rosa took 15th on the soft compound tyre and was the highest qualifying Arrows driver. Villeneuve finished 16th when his BAR chassis failed to generate enough downforce. Johnny Herbert, 17th for Jaguar, spun late in qualifying and had excess oversteer. He was followed in 18th by Zonta, who lacked downforce. For his fourth run, Nick Heidfeld switched to the spare Prost AP03 car and reported excessive oversteer en route to qualifying 19th. Jos Verstappen, 20th, struggled to adapt to the high-downforce track with his Arrows car. The Minardi drivers qualified 21st and 22nd in their underpowered cars; Marc Gené outqualified teammate Mazzacane by two-tenths of a second after the latter went wide onto the grass during his fastest lap, losing nearly half a second.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

The drivers took to the track in hot, sunny weather at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Rainfall the night before had cleaned the circuit. Teams used the session to adjust and check their race and spare cars before the race. With ten minutes remaining, Coulthard set the pace with a lap time of 1:19.261. Michael Schumacher outpaced teammate Barrichello and behind Coulthard by 0.120 seconds in the second and third-placed Ferraris. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Williams finished fourth. Due to traffic on his best lap, Häkkinen set the fifth-fastest time, 1.2 seconds behind teammate Coulthard. Frentzen completed the top six drivers. To clean his starting spot on the track&#x27;s right-hand side, Coulthard completed one installation lap in the spare McLaren on the start-finish straight. An engine failure caused Irvine to enter the pit lane with smoke billowing from his car.

==Race==

The 77-lap race was held over began at 14:00 local time before 120,000 spectators, (with 30,000 from Finland). The event saw hot and partially cloudy weather; the air temperature was and the track temperature ranged between ; conditions were expected to remain consistent throughout the race. It was warmer than the morning warm-up session, and drivers needed to drink a lot of water to cope up with the physical demands of cockpit temperatures and the circuit. Except for De La Rosa, all drivers began on the extra soft tyre compounds. Mazzacane suffered a gearbox issue and had to start in his spare car while the grid was assembling. Herbert also intended to drive his backup car because his regular car suffered a leak that was repaired before the start. Coulthard made a slow poor start on the dirty inner part of the start-finish straight. His teammate Häkkinen had more momentum than Michael Schumacher and turned right to pass him on the inside for the lead at the 180-degree first corner while near the right-hand side kerb. Michael Schumacher slowed to avoid colliding with Häkkinen and avoided retiring from the opening lap for the third successive race. 

Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s attempts to pass Coulthard for third on the inside the opening two turns were unsuccessful. Villeneuve and De La Rosa collided into the chicane and both cars (which lacked mechanical grip) sustained damage. Villeneuve made a pit stop for a new front wing assembly followed by De La Rosa for a new set of tyres since he sustained a left rear puncture. At the first lap&#x27;s conclusion, Häkkinen led from Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, and Frentzen. Michael Schumacher was close behind Häkkinen but not close enough to overtake him for the lead. Häkkinen began to pull away gradually from Michael Schumacher, increasing his lead to 3.5 seconds by the eighth lap. Fisichella in seventh had poor brake balance and slid wide onto the grass at the first corner on lap eight due to a lack of grip. In order to prevent a collision, Button slowed slightly. Irvine used this incident to pass Button for seventh position on the short straight into the second corner. Fisichella fell to 14th place. On lap 12, Fisichella ran wide into a gravel trap and was passed by Herbert for 13th. Fisichella took his first pit stop for brake repairs three laps later and rejoined the track in 19th. On that lap, Alesi became the race&#x27;s first retirement after a series of pit stops by mechanics failed to repair a broken left-rear suspension that had been exacerbated by a change in wheel alignment.

Häkkinen had a seven-second lead over Michael Schumacher by lap 19. Coulthard was three seconds behind Michael Schumacher owing to an incorrect tyre pressure setting and was pulling away from Ralf Schumacher. Heidfeld became the race&#x27;s second retirement when his car failed due to a drop in battery voltage after a pit stop after completing 22 laps. Three laps later, Irvine made his first pit stop from seventh and fell to 11th. At the end of lap 27, Brawn asked Michael Schumacher to enter the pit lane for the first of two scheduled stops, which lasted 7.3 seconds. He rejoined the track in fifth, behind his teammate Barrichello. On the 29th lap, Barrichello relinquished third to teammate Michael Schumacher at the first corner. Barrichello entered the pit lane on the 30th lap and completed the stop in 6.7 seconds. He returned to the circuit in sixth, ahead of Ralf Schumacher, whose own pit stop was hampered by a jammed wheel nut.

Race leader Häkkinen, whose drink bottle failed roughly a third of the way into the race and he became exhausted, made a seven-second pit stop on lap 31 for a new set of tyres, falling behind teammate Coulthard. Häkkinen reclaimed the race lead after Coulthard&#x27;s 6.9-second pit stop for fuel and tyres on the following lap. Coulthard returned to the track in third, behind Michael Schumacher but ahead of Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Barrichello. Häkkinen set the race&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, as he continued to pull away from Michael Schumacher. Fisichella retired on the 36th lap as his car became difficult to drive owing to bargeboard damage. Coulthard on a new set of tyres, lapped faster and was two seconds behind Michael Schumacher by lap 37 as Schumacher&#x27;s cautious pace preserved his tyres since they wore quickly on the Ferrari. 

When Coulthard was delayed by Genè on lap 47 and lost more than a second, Michael Schumacher increased the gap. Genè would receive a 10-second stop-go penalty for delaying Irvine&#x27;s Jaguar. As he had been short-fuelled, Barrichello made his second pit stop on lap 48, lasting 8.7 seconds. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher made their pit stops on lap 51. Michael Schumacher was brought into the pit lane since slower cars were likely to impede Coulthard. On the following lap, Coulthard replied by making his second pit stop, which lasted 6.6 seconds, and rejoined the circuit in third place, close behind Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen completed his final pit stop on the 53rd lap, having built a 21-second lead over Michael Schumacher. Frentzen became the last driver to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 56. The top six in the running order at the end of lap 57, with all scheduled pit stops completed, were Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, and Frentzen. Herbert spun while battling Villeneuve for 13th position. 

On lap 65, Diniz&#x27;s car stopped between turns nine and ten due to engine failure. Herbert dropped behind Verstappen on lap 70 after spinning in front of him at the first corner. He retired two laps later with gearbox problems. Mazzacane retired on track on lap 73 with an engine failure after a visor became caught inside a radiator, causing water temperatures to rise too high. Trulli caught and passed Button for seventh on the first corner on lap 75. Button lost eighth to Irvine a lap later. A cracked engine exhaust or a throttle control issue slowing Button in the last laps, giving him less available horsepower. Häkkinen slowed his pace to lap within the 1:24 minute range, finishing first for his third victory of the season and 17th of his career in a time of 1&#x27;45:33.869, at an average speed of . Michael Schumacher finished second 7.9 seconds behind, ahead of Coulthard in third. In the hot weather, Barrichello lost of weight and of fluids after running out of water by the 40th lap. Ralf Schumacher took fifth and Frentzen completed the points scorers in sixth. Trulli, Irvine, Button, Salo, and Wurz finished one lap behind the winner. The final classified finishers Villeneuve, Verstappen, Zonta, Gené, and De La Rosa. There were six retirements during the event.

===Post-race===

The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen said that modifications to his car&#x27;s engine caused his good start. Norbert Haug, Vice President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, complimented his victory. &quot;Mika had a great race,&quot; he said. &quot;His victory may have looked easy, but it was tough to achieve and in my view this was one of his best drives ever.&quot; Although he was unable to catch Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher expressed satisfaction with finishing second. He admitted to being too cautious at the start because he lost momentum and said Häkkinen would have overtaken him during the pit stops had he not done so at the start. Coulthard believed his car had balance issues prior to his first pit stop, which accounted for his lack of place. He also said that time spent behind backmarkers during the second stint hampered his attempts to overtake Michael Schumacher, but that third was the best possible result he could have achieved.

Following Ferrari&#x27;s previous race victory, Brawn stated, &quot;Our pitstops and our race strategy went well, but we just weren&#x27;t quick enough.&quot;, while Di Montezemolo urged Ferrari&#x27;s mechanics and engineers to focus on resolving the issue of wheel-spin and praised Häkkinen for his recent trend of good starts. Barrichello blamed his fourth-place finish on a poor qualifying performance. Ralf Schumacher and Frentzen were pleased to finish fifth and sixth, respectively. Fisichella, who retired with a brake problem, stated that the recurring issue damaged his car and forced his retirement. Gené blamed his stop-go penalty on faulty radio communication with his team, saying that he was not shown the blue flag until the last moment. Gary Anderson, Jaguar&#x27;s technical director, was furious with Gené after the race, believing the Spaniard&#x27;s driving cost Irvine the chance to score points. &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why the blue flags weren&#x27;t waved because it was plain for all to see.&quot; said Anderson.

As a result of the race result, Häkkinen took the lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship for the first time in the season, with 64 points, putting Michael Schumacher two points behind him. Coulthard was third with 58 points, nine points ahead of fourth-placed Barrichello and 40 points ahead of fifth-placed Fisichella. McLaren became the new leaders of the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 112 points, demoting Ferrari to second on 111 points. Williams in third were now six points ahead of Benetton in fourth. With Jordan&#x27;s one point scored by Frentzen finishing sixth, the team passed BAR for fifth with 12 points. Despite McLaren taking the lead in both championships, team principal Ron Dennis acknowledged he expected both drivers to have the advantage in most of the five remaining races but that complacency would limit his team&#x27;s chances of success.

<text>The 2000 Belgian Grand Prix (formally, the LVIII Foster&#x27;s Belgian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 27 August 2000 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Francorchamps, Wallonia, Belgium with a crowd of 83,000 spectators. It was the 13th race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, and the 58th Belgian Grand Prix. McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen won the 44-lap race from pole position. Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari, and Williams driver Ralf Schumacher was third.

Häkkinen went into the event as the World Drivers&#x27; Championship leader with his team McLaren leading the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. The race began behind the safety car due to overnight rainfall making the track wet and reducing visibility. When the safety car returned to the pit lane Häkkinen built a significant lead over Jarno Trulli. As the track dried and other drivers made pit stops, Häkkinen maintained his lead until a lap-13 spin gave Michael Schumacher the lead for most of the remainder of the race. By the 34th lap Schumacher&#x27;s tyres began to degrade; he drove off the racing line to cool them, which allowed Häkkinen to close the gap. On lap 41 Häkkinen overtook Michael Schumacher for the lead while lapping BAR driver Ricardo Zonta and maintaining the lead to win. Although Rubens Barrichello set the fastest lap time in the other Ferrari, he was hampered by a poor qualifying performance and retired with a fuel-pressure problem thirteen laps from the finish.

Häkkinen&#x27;s victory extended his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to six points over Michael Schumacher, with Coulthard a further seven points behind. Barrichello&#x27;s retirement dropped him to twenty-five points behind Häkkinen. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren extended their lead to eight points over Ferrari with four races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2000 Belgian Grand Prix was the 13th of 17 races in the 2000 Formula One World Championship and took place at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Francorchamps, Wallonia, Belgium on 27 August 2000. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the soft and medium dry compounds as well as the hard and soft wet-weather compounds to the event; the intermediate had a curvy pattern and the full wet was designed for the track&#x27;s common rainy conditions. The wet-weather tyres were introduced for the race in response to prospective new tyre supplier Michelin beginning their tyre-development program during the year, resulting in Bridgestone increasing their development rate to research advances.

Following his victory at the , McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 64 points, ahead of Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher (62 points) and McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard (58). Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 49 points, and Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth with 18. McLaren led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 112 points, one point ahead of second-placed Ferrari. Williams were third with 24 points, while Benetton (18 points) and Jordan (12) were fourth and fifth respectively.

After the race in Hungary, five teams conducted mid-season testing at the Silverstone Circuit from 15 to 17 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest on the first day, ahead of Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Williams test driver Bruno Junqueira&#x27;s car had a water leak, resulting in repairs which limited his team&#x27;s testing time. Panis remained the fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen&#x27;s Arrows car had a sensor failure, limiting his team&#x27;s testing time; the car&#x27;s floor had to be removed to install a new sensor. Panis was again fastest on the final day of testing. Ferrari opted to test the suspension and tyres of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s car at the Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher later moved to the Mugello Circuit, with Barrichello conducting engine and setup tests, and Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer remained at Fiorano for development work on new car components. Prost opted to test at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 17–18 August with driver Jean Alesi. Benetton conducted a five-day, one-car test at the Danielson Circuit, with test driver Mark Webber on aerodynamic development for the first four days and Alexander Wurz concentrating on practice starts the last day.

In September 1999 the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) released a provisional calendar for the 2000 season, dropping the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps from the Formula One World Championship due to Belgian tobacco-advertising laws which threatened to cancel the race; several teams had tobacco sponsorship. The FIA had the revived Dutch Grand Prix at the Circuit Zandvoort and the Portuguese Grand Prix at the Circuito do Estoril as alternatives if the Belgian Grand Prix was cancelled. The dispute was resolved when the Belgian government exempted the race from the advertising law, and it was reinstated at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris on 6 October.

The event featured eleven teams (each represented by a different constructor) and two drivers, with no changes from the season entry list. Ferrari arrived at the circuit with a lighter, more-powerful version of its Tipo 049 V10 engine for Saturday&#x27;s qualifying session, returning to the development power plant used at the Hungarian Grand Prix. They also had a bespoke revised low downforce aerodynamic package for the high-speed circuit. Williams brought new exhausts and an extractor profile, while the other teams only introduced minor car refinements.

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race, two one-hour sessions Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. Conditions were dry for the Friday morning and afternoon practice sessions. A dense layer of dust was gradually cleared from the track. Coulthard set the first session&#x27;s fastest time with a lap of 1 minute, 53.398 seconds, eight-tenths of a second quicker than Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen had the third-fastest time, with Jarno Trulli for Jordan, Barrichello and BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve in the next three positions. The two Benetton drivers were seventh and eighth (with Wurz ahead of Fisichella), and the Williams cars of Ralf Schumacher and Button completed the top ten. Alesi&#x27;s Prost had a fuel-pressure problem which prevented him from completing a timed lap, and he was the slowest overall. Button almost hit the tyre wall at La Source and avoided losing control of the rear of his car under braking for the Bus Stop chicane. Ferrari limited their running during the session to limit their tyre usage.

In the second practice session, due to a slow rear puncture Coulthard&#x27;s first-session lap was still the fastest; Häkkinen had the second-fastest time. Jaguar driver Johnny Herbert changed his car&#x27;s balance, improving its performance and finishing third-fastest. Villeneuve moved into fourth after changes to his car&#x27;s setup; Michael Schumacher slipped to fifth, and Wurz finished sixth. Verstappen was seventh-fastest, ahead of Fisichella, Barrichello and Trulli in positions eight through ten.

The weather remained dry for the Saturday-morning practice sessions. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the third session at 1 minute, 51.043 seconds, quicker than his best on Friday and ahead of Frentzen, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher. Coulthard, who had an engine problem early in the session, was fifth-fastest (ahead of Button and Michael Schumacher). Alesi, Villeneuve and Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session Häkkinen could not improve his time, although he remained the fastest. Button, much happier with his car&#x27;s handling, set the second-fastest time. The Jordan drivers were third and fourth, with Trulli ahead of Frentzen. Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard completed the top six. Of the slower drivers, Marc Gené&#x27;s Minardi car shed its engine cover but he was able to return to his garage.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the quickest lap time in order to qualify for the race. The session was held in clear, sunny weather. Häkkinen was unhindered by slower traffic, clinched his fifth pole position of the season and the 26th of his career with a time of 1 minute, 50.646 seconds; although he was optimistic about his race prospects, he was concerned about the start. Häkkinen was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Trulli, who equalled his best qualifying performance of the season (at the ). Trulli was also optimistic about his chances because of the Jordan team&#x27;s strong record at the circuit. Button&#x27;s car had a new qualifying engine installed in the rear, which was the same as his teammate&#x27;s. Despite a power steering issue, he chose to fine-tune his setup and qualify third, his highest qualifying place of the season. He said he was happy with his starting position. Michael Schumacher, whose fastest lap had been hampered by traffic and a yellow flag for an incident, secured fourth, nine-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, setting a lap which demoted Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate Coulthard into fifth. Coulthard, who had problems with grip, believed that he could have lapped faster due to slower cars impeding his final two runs and a requirement to slow for the Bus Stop chicane following an incident.

Ralf Schumacher secured sixth position after being caught in traffic during his final run, keeping the Williams driver from a quicker lap time. Villeneuve, in seventh, reported oversteering, and was upset he could not go through Eau Rouge corner at high speed. Frentzen qualified eighth; his best lap time was disqualified after Coulthard blocked him at the Bus Stop chicane, which caused Frentzen to run onto the grass. He retaliated by slowing Coulthard into La Source corner at the start of his following lap. Herbert and Barrichello were ninth and tenth; Barrichello spun at the chicane during his third run after locking his brakes. Fisichella, eleventh, missed the top ten by three-tenths of a second on his only quick qualifying run. Herbert&#x27;s teammate, Eddie Irvine, qualified twelfth with tyre-grip problems. He was ahead of Zonta in the slower of the two BARs (which lost a half-second through Eau Rouge), Heidfeld in the faster Prost, Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa. Alesi qualified 17th, despite spinning at the Bus Stop chicane and triggering a yellow flag, preventing several drivers from lapping quicker. Salo qualified 18th due to car issues caused by a lack of grip, ahead of Wurz (who suffered engine troubles, causing smoke to billow from it on the entry to the Bus Stop chicane on his outlap, and shared the spare Benetton monocoque with Fisichella). Verstappen, after a braking error at La Source, and the two Minardi drivers of Gené and Mazzacane qualified at the back of the grid, in positions 20 to 22.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

The drivers took the track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in wet weather, with lap times 13 seconds slower than the previous days&#x27; practice and qualifying sessions. Heavy rain fell early in the morning from 5:00 am and it increased incrementally before stopping; a rising mist formed low on the track by dawn. Drivers used full-wet tyres on the slippery track, then intermediate rain tyres when it began drying. Häkkinen set the fastest lap time of the session at 2:03.392. Michael Schumacher was the second-fastest driver; Button was third, two-thousands of a second slower than Schumacher. Barrichello was fourth and Coulthard completed the five fastest drivers.

After spinning sideways because his left-rear wheel touched a damp white line, Fisichella struck the tyre barrier at Stavelot corner with enough force to launch him into the air. He landed upside-down on the vehicle&#x27;s roll-hoop; the session was suspended for approximately 20 minutes while marshals cleared the track of debris and repaired the wall. Fisichella sustained a bruised left knee, and had to start the race with his team&#x27;s spare car. Villeneuve damaged his car&#x27;s rear in a crash against the tyre barrier at Les Fagnes turn later in the session, but was able to continue.

==Race==
The 44 lap race, commenced before 83,000 spectators at 14:00 local time, with air and track temperatures at ; clouds, but no rain, were predicted for the race. The rain had stopped approximately an hour before the race began, but there was standing water on the track, causing heavy spray and poor visibility, the race would begin behind the safety car after consultation between the drivers and FIA race director Charlie Whiting on the track&#x27;s state.; all cars except Pedro Diniz&#x27; had wet tyres. The intermediate and full wet tyres were reported to be suitable for short stints, thus the normal wet or grooved tyres were the tyre selection for the event. Every driver had a car setup with compromises made for wet-weather conditions and additions to downforce as well as setup changes for dry weather racing.

Instead of a two-by-two standing start, the race began with an American-style single file rolling start with no formation lap. During the safety car period, Diniz spun off; he was passed by Pedro de la Rosa, who received a ten-second stop-go penalty which he served on lap 13. The safety car entered the pit lane after one lap, and the cars were allowed to overtake after crossing the start-finish line. Häkkinen maintained his lead going into the first corner, followed by Trulli, Button, Michael Schumacher and Coulthard. Barrichello overtook Herbert for ninth place at the first turn. At the end of the first racing lap, Diniz dropped to the rear of the field. De la Rosa lost 16th position on lap three after running wide at turn 18, losing two places to Alesi and Verstappen.

Häkkinen began to pull away from Trulli. Attention switched to Button, who tried to pass Trulli, who he felt was baulking him and noticed Michael Schumacher approaching him, On the fourth lap Button slipstreamed Trulli on the approach to the Bus Stop chicane, but he ran wide and left the inside open for Michael Schumacher to take third position. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver to pit for dry tyres after informing his team over the radio of his intent to do so when the track began to dry. By the beginning of the fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to 9.1 seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Button and Coulthard. Schumacher then took second place from Trulli at La Source. Button was anxious to recover from his error and attempted to follow Schumacher down the inside at the same corner, but Button and Trulli collided. Trulli was sent into a spin, becoming the first retirement of the race after he stalled the engine. Button lost two positions to Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher into the Eau Rouge corner and he spent the next three laps inspecting his car for damage. He sustained front wing and minor steering damage.

As the dry line continued to appear on the circuit, Alesi&#x27;s dry tyre performance saw him lap quicker than the race leaders, encouraging other teams to bring their drivers into the pit lane for dry tyres. Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the first leaders to pit for dry tyres on lap six. Häkkinen made a pit stop from the lead on lap seven, followed by Button, and re-emerged ahead of Coulthard to retain the lead. Coulthard was required to stay on the track on deteriorating wet-weather tyres while his team tended to Häkkinen. He made his pit stop on the eighth lap, re-emerging in ninth position. All drivers made pit stops by the end of lap nine. The race order at the time was Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Alesi, Button, and Villeneuve. During that lap Barrichello overtook Frentzen for seventh, whilst Verstappen and Fisichella collided after Verstappen tried to pass the slowing Benetton at the Bus Stop chicane. Verstappen sustained damage to his front wing, and Fisichella later retired with an electrical problem caused by a loss of power.

By the beginning of lap 13, Michael Schumacher closed the gap from Häkkinen to about 4.6 seconds after setting four consecutive fastest laps. Later in the lap, one of Häkkinen&#x27;s wheels touched a damp kerb at Stavelot corner, sending him high-speed spinning sideways for hundreds of yards into the grass; Michael Schumacher took the lead, as a result of Häkkinen&#x27;s error, which cost the McLaren driver ten seconds. Heidfeld was the race&#x27;s third retirement when his car developed an engine failure caused by a broken gearbox that affected the common oil circuit. Alesi, the first front-runner to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a pit stop from sixth position and came out in eleventh.

By lap 21, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven-and-a-half seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, led teammate Button by six seconds. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on that lap that took 11.1 seconds to complete and took on enough fuel to complete the race, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and during the next two laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit stop from fourth position on lap 26. Häkkinen entered the pit lane one lap later after holding five more laps of fuel than Michael Schumacher and an adjustment to his car made it faster; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to gain on Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position.

Barrichello, setting the race&#x27;s fastest lap (1 minute, 53.803 seconds on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit stop on lap 31. However, his car&#x27;s fuel pressure dropped which caused him to run out of fuel and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem caused by a fractured fuel system) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap 33. At the end of lap 34, after all scheduled pit stops, the running order was Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Button, Coulthard, and Frentzen. During that lap Michael Schumacher&#x27;s soft compound tyres began to degrade on the drying track, and he ran off the racing line to cool them by driving through water; Häkkinen gradually closed the gap, due to his McLaren having a straightline speed advantage on the straights. He began duelling Michael Schumacher for the race lead as the track had become completely dry. Coulthard, fifth, passed Button on the outside entering Les Combes corner for fourth on lap 37.

Häkkinen tried to pass Michael Schumacher on the inside for the lead on the 40th lap on the approach to Les Combes turn, (after drafting behind him on the straightaway), Schumacher blocked him late in the manoevure to defend his position. The drivers made contact, with Häkkinen sustaining minor damage to his front wing from contact with Schumacher&#x27;s right-rear wheel and being forced to slow. During the following lap, Häkkinen was quicker through Eau Rouge turn and drew closer to Michael Schumacher. While they were lapping Zonta&#x27;s slower car who was on the centre of the circuit, Häkkinen steered right onto a damp patch to pass Schumacher for the lead after Schumacher turned left believing there was insufficient space on the right. Zonta had slowed to allow Schumacher through and Häkkinen turned left with the extra momentum gained from the slipstream from both Schumacher and Zonta&#x27;s cars to be ahead into the right-hand Les Combes corner at .

Häkkinen kept the lead for the rest of the race, crossing the finish line on lap 44 for his fourth victory of the season and his 18th in Formula One in a time of 1&#x27;28:14.494—an average speed of . Michael Schumacher finished second, 1.1 seconds behind Häkkinen. Ralf Schumacher was third but became worried about a possible engine failure in the final six laps (a throttle fault nearly forced him to retire). Coulthard finished fourth after being on the track longer than teammate Häkkinen before his pit stop for dry tyres. Button followed in fifth and Frentzen completed the points scorers in sixth. Villeneuve (who reported race-long handling issues), Herbert, Salo, Irvine and Diniz filled the next five positions. Zonta, Wurz, Gené and Verstappen finished a lap behind the leader, and de la Rosa and Mazzacane were the final finishers. 17 of the 22 starters finished the Grand Prix.

===After the race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory, saying: &quot;This was an incredible win. It was a very difficult and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not much you can do. I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better.&quot; The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen&#x27;s overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind slower cars for straight-line speed assistance during the race&#x27;s closing stages.

Ralf Schumacher said, &quot;I&#x27;m more than happy; we have been strong here the whole weekend and my car behaved perfectly. I had a little moment of worry about six laps from the end when the throttle didn&#x27;t seem to pick up properly and I thought the engine was going to stop, but it came back and all was well.&quot; Schumacher added that his team was confident of remaining third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen&#x27;s pace, he praised the team for his car&#x27;s set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team&#x27;s decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors put him at a disadvantage; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth, stating: &quot;It was a bad race for me, if not the worst. The car was working well at the start, but when I tried to pass Jarno I went in a bit late.&quot; Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he &quot;felt sorry&quot; for Verstappen and describing his weekend as &quot;disastrous&quot;. Verstappen said that he struggled with his car&#x27;s balance, which resulted in oversteer. He was &quot;happy to go home&quot; because &quot;it&#x27;s not been a good weekend&quot;. Frentzen said that although he was happy to score points, he had hoped for a better finish.
The media focused on Häkkinen overtaking Michael Schumacher for the lead on lap 41. After the race, Häkkinen went to Schumacher in &quot;parc fermé&quot; and told him not to make such a manoeuvre with at high speed that he deemed &quot;a life and death situation&quot; and not to make a move like that again. Zonta later said that although he was unaware of Häkkinen&#x27;s presence, he saw Schumacher in his mirrors. Schumacher would go on to be complimentary of the manoeuvre. Derick Allsop of &quot;The Independent&quot; described the impact the move might have on Häkkinen&#x27;s career, commenting: &quot;Perhaps, he [Mika Häkkinen] will be recognised as a driver worthy of a place in the pantheon of the sport&#x27;s heroes.&quot; McLaren team principal Ron Dennis said: &quot;His overtaking manoeuvre I&#x27;m sure will go down as one of the greatest in Formula One history.&quot; In February 2001, Häkkinen&#x27;s move was chosen by more than 60 Formula One historians as the MasterCard Priceless Moment of the 2000 F1 season.

The use of a safety car to start the race had a mixed response within the sport. Coulthard agreed with the FIA&#x27;s decision, saying: &quot;I know there will be a debate over it but the fact is I was asked beforehand and I said that, based on the previous years we&#x27;ve had here, the safest thing is to have a safety-car start.&quot; He added that although the safety-car start eliminated overtaking, it also prevented a major accident. Ralf Schumacher also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. ITV-F1 commentator and former driver Martin Brundle felt that the track was not wet enough for a safety car. Journalist Nigel Roebuck said that the length of time under safety-car conditions was inadequate, and raised the possibility of abandoning standing starts. Whiting consulted Coulthard, the drivers&#x27; representative, before making his decision.

After the race, Häkkinen remained in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead with 74 points. Michael Schumacher was second with 68 points, seven points ahead of Coulthard and nineteen ahead of Barrichello. Ralf Schumacher passed Fisichella for fifth place with 20 points, and Frentzen moved ahead of teammate Trulli and Salo. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren maintained their lead with 125 points and Ferrari remained in second with 117 points. Williams increased their lead over Benetton to twelve points, and Jordan remained fifth with 13 points. Given Häkkinen&#x27;s increased lead, Michael Schumacher acknowledged that his team lacked speed against McLaren in the season&#x27;s four remaining races but remained confident of winning the world championship.

<doc id="1123405" wikidata="Q363051" url="?curid=1123405" title="2000 Italian Grand Prix">
<text>The 2000 Italian Grand Prix (formally the LXXI Gran Premio Campari d&#x27;Italia) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 September 2000, at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza near Monza, Lombardy, Italy, in front of an estimated 110,000 to 120,000 people. It was the 14th round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and the season&#x27;s final event in Europe. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 53-lap race from pole position. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen took second and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher was third.

Before the race, Häkkinen led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and McLaren led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Michael Schumacher maintained the lead and held off Häkkinen&#x27;s attempts to pass him going into the first corner. An incident involving four cars further around the lap necessitated the safety car&#x27;s deployment and fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti was struck by a flying wheel from Heinz-Harald Frentzen&#x27;s car. When the safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to pull away from Häkkinen and maintained the lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead, which he held to earn his sixth victory of the season and the 41st of his career, tying him with Ayrton Senna; Häkkinen came in second 3.8 seconds later.

As a result of the race results, Schumacher cut Häkkinen&#x27;s World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead to two points, with David Coulthard another 17 points back. Rubens Barrichello, who was involved in the first-lap accident, was mathematically ruled out of winning the championship. McLaren&#x27;s eight-point lead entering the Grand Prix was down to four with three races remaining in the season. Gislimberti died later in hospital, prompting a review of Formula One safety standards.

==Background==
On 10 September 2000, the clockwise Autodromo Nazionale di Monza near Monza in Lombardy, Italy, hosted the 13th round of 17th in the 2000 Formula One World Championship. It was the season&#x27;s final European race. The event featured eleven teams (each representing a different constructor), each with two drivers with no changes to the season entry list. Control tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the hardest available compounds to the race, the medium and hard dry compounds. Because the Monza Circuit saw high average lap times, every team installed low incidence ailerons and the wings observed at the .

McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 74 points going into the race, followed by Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher on 68 points and Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard on 61 points. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 49 points and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher was fifth with 20 points. McLaren led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 125 points, followed by Ferrari and Williams with 117 and 30 points, respectively, while Benetton were fourth with 18 points and Jordan were fifth with 13 points.

At the previous race in Belgium, the gap between Häkkinen (who won three of the preceding four races) and Michael Schumacher had grown to six points. Häkkinen began from pole position and led until the 13th lap, when he lost control of his car at Stavelot corner. He later lapped quicker than Michael Schumacher and passed him while both were lapping BAR driver Ricardo Zonta with four laps remaining to win the race. The overtake was hailed as &quot;the best ever manoeuvre in grand prix racing&quot; by the international press and many Formula One individuals. Michael Schumacher remained confident about his title chances: &quot;With only six points between Mika and I and four more races to go, I am still optimistic about our chances. One win or a retirement before the end of the season can change the whole picture either way.&quot; 

The track was modified by its management to try and allow more overtaking. The main straight was straightened in July, and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to form a series of narrow corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the circuit&#x27;s two sections were expanded, and its tight kerbs removed. The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) requested those changes. Some drivers were dissatisfied with the changes, fearing a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard said that the new corner would make braking more difficult and expressed concern about the number of penalties issued to other drivers. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned about suspension damage. Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi, the first driver to test the new circuit, said that drivers would be able to leave the track more easily in the event of a technical issue.

Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, the teams conducted a four-day testing session at Monza and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen set the first day&#x27;s quickest times, ahead of Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Benetton driver Giancarlo Fisichella crashed at high speed into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome for a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle; he was cleared to race after five days of recuperation. Jacques Villeneuve lapped fastest for BAR on the third day as rain shortened the team&#x27;s running. Minardi&#x27;s Gastón Mazzacane had a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on testing&#x27;s fourth and final day. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari&#x27;s testing time as the car&#x27;s power unit was changed.

==Practice==
Two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday preceded Sunday&#x27;s race. Drivers manoeuvred their cars on a hot track in dry weather. On Friday morning with ten minutes remaining, Barrichello set the first session&#x27;s quickest time of 1:25.057 seconds on his final timed lap. He was three-tenths of a second faster than Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli in second. Michael Schumacher finished third, one-tenth of a second slower than Trulli, with Coulthard fourth. Pedro de la Rosa was fifth fastest, ahead of Arrows teammate Verstappen. Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Fisichella, Villeneuve, and Benetton&#x27;s Alexander Wurz rounded out the top ten fastest drivers. Some drivers ran wide onto the Rettifilo chicane at least once during practice. Häkkinen did not set a timed lap due to a slipping clutch, which was rectified for the second session.

It was sunny and warm for the second practice session. Barrichello was again fastest despite not improving his time from the first session; Michael Schumacher, Trulli, Häkkinen, Coulthard, Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, De La Rosa, Diniz, Verstappen and Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo completed the top ten drivers. Alesi&#x27;s car developed a hydraulic leak, limiting him to three timed laps and placing him last overall. Wurz was stopped at the exit of the Parabolica turn due to a similar problem. Mazzacane spun off and missed the rest of the session. Coulthard spun off under braking into the second Lesmo right-hand curve and beached his car in the gravel, breaking the McLaren&#x27;s left-rear suspension arm and ending his running early.

Following a series of crashes at the first corner in recent events, drivers agreed to take a cautious approach at the first chicane at the drivers&#x27; meeting on Friday. If they did not gain a position or an advantage after concerns were raised, they would not be penalised ten seconds. The Saturday practice sessions were again held in dry, sunny weather. Michael Schumacher set the third session&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:24.262. The Williams drivers were in the top five, with Jenson Button second after a late-session lap and Ralf Schumacher fifth, separated by Coulthard and Barrichello in third and fourth. Fisichella, Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Salo and Jaguar&#x27;s Johnny Herbert completed the top ten. In a crash at the fast Parabolica corner tyre wall, Frentzen went wide onto the edge of some dust, damaging the car&#x27;s front-left corner. Häkkinen ran onto the gravel and struggled to regain control of his car.

Michael Schumacher set the final practice session&#x27;s quickest lap time, a 1:23.904; Barrichello was third. Häkkinen separated them, with teammate Coulthard fourth-fastest. Ralf Schumacher lapped faster to maintain fifth place, ahead of teammate Jenson Button, who was unable to reproduce his third session performance. Fisichella, Zonta, Villeneuve and Irvine (who suffered a rear suspension failure but regained control of his car) rounded out the top ten. Mazzacane&#x27;s engine ran out of air pressure and caused him to stop on the track again, while Wurz did not record any laps owing to a fuel pick-up issue. While his car was being repaired, Frentzen did not set any lap times.

==Qualifying==

Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting position determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in effect during qualifying, which required each driver to record a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race.. The session was held in dry weather. Michael Schumacher used his teammate&#x27;s wing setup and undertray on his car to achieve his sixth pole position of the season and 29th of his career, with a time of 1:23.770. Despite being pleased with his car and tyres, he said that he did not have the best session due to a mistake at the first chicane during his first run. Michael Schumacher was joined on the front row by Barrichello, whose lap time was 0.027 seconds slower with ten minutes left and was happy to start alongside his teammate. Häkkinen qualified third following handling difficulties and his McLaren misfiring due to a fuel pressure fault, distracting him during his final two timed laps. Villeneuve recorded BAR&#x27;s best qualifying result at the time, taking fourth on his final fast lap with 12 minutes remaining, nearly half a second behind Michael Schumacher. Despite a minor error on his first run, he was pleased with his performance. Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate Coulthard took fifth after suffering traffic and car balance issues during qualifying. Frentzen blocked him leaving the Rettifilo chicane on his last run. Trulli and Frentzen were sixth and eighth respectively for Jordan; Trulli reported no problems while Frentzen was impeded by De La Rosa on his final quick run, losing him approximately four-tenths of a second. Ralf Schumacher, seventh, was disappointed with his performance, which saw him abort two runs owing to his braking position. Fisichella took ninth.

De La Rosa&#x27;s modified his car and he qualified tenth with a fast lap recorded with two minutes remaining. His teammate Verstappen qualified eleventh after having to drive two of his team&#x27;s cars when they had hydraulic and engine problems, causing him to stop in the gravel at Ascari corner. Button qualified twelfth after overheading his tyres and lacking control of his car after decreasing downforce. Wurz, 13th, used the session to familiarise himself with Benetton&#x27;s spare car after lacking practice. He was ahead of Irvine in the faster of the two Jaguars, whose best time was one-tenth of a second faster than his teammate Johnny Herbert in 18th; both were disadvantaged by a lack of straightline speed. Salo, 15th, was the Sauber team&#x27;s fastest driver, ahead of his teammate Diniz whose car handled badly under braking for the Rettifilo and della Roggia chicanes. The pair were marginally faster than Zonta, who had gear selection issues in his race car and had to stop on the track before switching to his team&#x27;s spare vehicle configured for Villeneuve. Alesi and Nick Heidfeld in the Prosts were 18th and 19th after driving with understeer. They qualified ahead of the Minardis of Marc Gené and Mazzacane, who were 21st and 22nd; Mazzacane&#x27;s car stopped at the Lesmo corners due to an electrical problem and returned to the pit lane to drive the spare car.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track in dry weather at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC +1) for a 30-minute warm-up session following a spell of mist that fell on the circuit. Despite a major oversteer at Parabolica corner, Zonta set the session&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:26.448 with nine minutes left. He was six hundredths of a second faster than Häkkinen in warm-up&#x27;s final seconds. Michael Schumacher was third, ahead of Coulthard in fourth, Verstappen in fifth and Salo in sixth. No major incidents occurred during the session. Coulthard spun out of control of his McLaren at the exit of the second chicane owing to a rear suspension problem, although he was able to rejoin to the track. Irvine spun at the second Lesmo right-hand turn but recovered and resumed driving.

==Race==

The 53-lap, race started with around 110,000 to 120,000 people in attendance at 14:00 local time. The conditions for the race were warm and sunny, with the air temperature and the track temperature . Every driver began on the medium compound tyre because it was three-tenths of a second faster than the hard compound tyre. The race saw more tyre blistering because compound wear was worsened by braking hard for the first chicane. Mechanics worked on Heidfeld&#x27;s car who managed to get it to the side of the circuit before the formation lap began to avoid a penalty. 

Michael Schumacher kept his lead into the first corner, withstanding Häkkinen&#x27;s attempts to pass on the inside by switching lines. Barrichello made a slow start on the inside and dropped from second to fifth place, leaving the fast starting Villeneuve stuck behind the Ferrari. Salo and Irvine collided into the first corner, and both drivers crashed into Diniz. Irvine retired with suspension damage, while Salo suffered a left-rear puncture and Diniz&#x27;s front wing was removed.

A multi-car accident happened into the Variante della Roggia chicane (the second chicane). Barrichello attempted to pass Trulli on the inside as the following Frentzen on a light fuel load struck the left-rear corner of Trulli&#x27;s vehicle with his right-front corner at nearly . Frentzen then hit the right-rear corner of Barrichello&#x27;s Ferrari with his car&#x27;s left-front corner. All three cars spun and collected Coulthard, who was trying to turn into the chicane. All four cars spun into the gravel trap, creating a dense cloud of dust and smoke. Frentzen&#x27;s right front wheel struck fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti (who had moved from his post and took his fire extinguisher with him) on the upper body exposed through the barrier on the circuit&#x27;s left side. The following four drivers Villeneuve, Ralf Schumacher, Button, and Wurz passed through the scene without incident. The cloud blinded Herbert behind them, and the unsighted De La Rosa crashed into the back of Herbert&#x27;s Jaguar. De La Rosa was propelled roughly into the air, barrel rolling and somersaulting. He went over the top of Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren and landed upside down in the gravel across the suspension of Barrichello&#x27;s car. None of the drivers involved were seriously injured. The rest of the field passed through the accident scene unscathed. Herbert retired in the pit lane with a missing wheel, and Zonta was hit by De La Rosa, causing a front puncture.

The race was neither stopped or the start aborted by FIA race director Charlie Whiting to allow those involved in the crash to return to the pit lane and get into their spare cars. Whiting deployed the safety car at the first lap&#x27;s conclusion to allow marshals to remove strands of carbon fibre from the circuit and extricate the cars from the gravel trap. Gislimberti suffered head and chest injuries and was given a heart massage before being treated by doctors Sid Watkins and Gary Hartstein. Watkins and Harstein were not informed of Gislimberti&#x27;s condition because of erroneous initial reports and were not told to drive to the accident location until race control received word of Gislimberti&#x27;s injuries. Gislimberti was afterwards transported by ambulance to San Gerardo Hospital in cardiocirculatory arrest because helicopter transport would have taken longer. Salo became the fifth driver to pit on lap eight; his mechanics fitted a new engine cover and sidepods to correct handling problems. The wait for Harstein and Watkins in the medical car to return to their position at the pit lane exit after administering aid to Gislimberti and instructing marshals not to leave the stricken vehicles at the back of the gravel trap but to move them to a safer area extended the safety car period.

After the safety car period ended on lap 11, Michael Schumacher bunched the field on the back straight between the Ascari chicane and Parabolica turn to prepare for the return to racing speeds. He braked and accelerated hard to generate heat into his brakes and tyres. This rapid drop in speed in the concertina effect surprised the five cars behind Michael Schumacher. In order to avoid colliding with Villeneuve, Button veered left onto the grass, hitting the guardrail barriers and damaging a wheel. He lost control of his car at the Parabolica curve because he had no steering and went into the gravel trap, retiring on lap 11. When the race restarted on lap 12, Michael Schumacher led, with Häkkinen and Villeneuve second and third. Behind them were Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, and Wurz. Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull away from Häkkinen as he set consecutive fastest laps. Further down the field, Wurz overtook Diniz and Mazzacane for tenth place. 

Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 1.4 seconds at the start of lap 13. Further back, Zonta passed Heidfeld to take ninth. On lap 14, Zonta moved into seventh after passing Gené and Wurz. Verstappen overtook Fisichella on the inside into the first chicane for fifth on the 15th lap. Villeneuve retired from third on the side of the track on that lap due to an electrical fault. On the 16th lap, Ralf Schumacher briefly lost control of his car and was overtaken by Verstappen and Zonta. Heidfeld spun, stalled on track at the Variante della Roggia chicane and retired after his engine failed on the same lap. A second safety car deployment was put on standby as marshals had difficulty removing his car from the circuit. After that, there were no more retirements, and the battle at the front and back of the field received attention.

Salo passed Mazzacane for ninth place on lap 17. Verstappen attempted to pass Zonta at the start of the 19th lap as they approached the Variante Goodyear chicane; Verstappen quickly took a defensive position to stop Zonta. Two laps later, Zonta made an attempt to pass Verstappen on the inside into the Variante della Rogia chicane for third but was unsuccessful because he ran wide and allowed Verstappen to draw alongside on the outside. After leaving the chicane on the same lap, Verstappen momentarily reclaimed third place before Zonta passed him because of his more powerful engine. Verstappen unsuccessfully attempted to repass Zonta for third. Michael Schumacher lapped consistently in the 1:26 range, setting the race&#x27;s new fastest lap on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to increase his advantage over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who was 9.9 seconds ahead of Zonta. Verstappen was 2.9 seconds behind in fourth but was drawing clear of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 24, Zonta became the first front-runner to make a scheduled pit stop for fuel and tyres, emerging in eleventh place. 

On lap 25, Salo passed Wurz for sixth place. Zonta overtook Mazzacane and Diniz on laps 26 and 27 to take eighth. Salo&#x27;s second pit stop came on lap 29 and he emerged in tenth. Verstappen made his pit stop four laps later and returned to the circuit in seventh. Zonta made his third and final pit stop for fuel on lap 37 and dropped to eighth place. Zonta&#x27;s final pit stop timing prevented him from finishing in the top three. Because little fuel was used during the safety car period, the race leaders sought to make their pit stops after two-thirds race distance. Michael Schumacher took his pit stop on the 40th lap and was stationary for 7.2 seconds. He rejoined the circuit 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who moved into the race lead. Michael Schumacher immediately began pushing hard to ensure that Häkkinen would not have a significant advantage following his pit stop. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a 6.6-second pit stop. He rejoined the track twelve seconds behind Michael Schumacher. Fisichella was the final driver to make a scheduled stop on lap 44. His pit stop was problematic: he stalled with a clutch system fault and his mechanics push-started his Benetton. Fisichella lost time and fell to eleventh. 

At the completion of lap 45, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the race order was Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Verstappen, Wurz, and Zonta. Zonta kept sixth despite going straight onto the escape road near the Variante Goodyear chicane. Häkkinen set out to close up to Michael Schumacher while encountering slower cars and being impeded by Mazzacane. He set the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:25.595 on lap 50 and drew to with 6.2 seconds of Michael Schumacher when Schumacher eased off slightly. Michael Schumacher was able to maintain his lead and took his sixth victory of 2000 and the 41st of his career to go level with Ayrton Senna in a time of 1&#x27;27:31.368, at an average speed of . Häkkinen came in second 3.8 seconds later, ahead of Ralf Schumacher, who finished third for the second successive race. Verstappen took fourth, Wurz finished fifth, and Zonta completed the points scorers in sixth, 1.8 seconds behind Wurz. Salo, Diniz, Gené, Mazzacane and Fisichella were in the next five positions a lap behind the winner, with Alesi the final classified finisher.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers collected their trophies on the podium and appeared in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher began crying when asked if tying Senna&#x27;s win total meant a lot to him. Later, when he had recovered his composure, he stressed the importance of maintaining engine&#x27;s life at Monza. Michael Schumacher revealed that the reason for his emotion was because he was remembering Senna&#x27;s death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. He also expressed his surprise at the media&#x27;s response, which said that Schumacher &quot;was human after all.&quot; Häkkinen revealed that his team&#x27;s adjustments to his car during his pit stop helped him set the race&#x27;s fastest lap. He also acknowledged that the two Minardis&#x27; slowing him prevented him from catching Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher said he was unworried by Verstappen and Zonta challenging him because of his quick car. He also was confident that Williams had confirmed itself as Formula One&#x27;s third strongest team.

Button blamed race leader Michael Schumacher catching him out for his retirement, asking: &quot;I thought you weren&#x27;t allowed to do that?&quot; Villeneuve disagreed, saying: &quot;Michael was only doing what you&#x27;re meant to do in that situation. The guys behind should calm down.&quot; Schumacher said he expected other drivers to generate heat in their brakes and apologised to those behind him if he caused them problems. Verstappen said he was pleased to finish fourth and commented on his pace: &quot;I was pushing the whole race because I knew that I had to make up time from the bad start.&quot; Wurz expressed his happiness at finishing fifth despite a lack of preparation, adding: &quot;fifth place made up for all this bad luck so far, and I&#x27;m really happy now with it.&quot; Zonta credited his car&#x27;s speed with allowing him to finish sixth and overtake. He added that a better qualifying result would have allowed him to compete for a higher finishing position or a podium finish.

Following discussions with the drivers involved in the first lap accidents, the stewards deemed it was &quot;a racing accident&quot; with no single driver to blame. Barrichello blamed Frentzen for starting the lap one crash at the Variante della Roggia corner. He demanded that Frentzen be banned for ten races. Barrichello also stated that his helmet was damaged in the collision with De La Rosa. Frentzen responded by suggesting that Barrichello braked too early, causing him to collide with teammate Trulli. Whiting defended his decision not to stop the race, saying that the safety car was deployed because all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that stopping the race would be dangerous. However, he admitted to being unaware of Gislimberti&#x27;s condition when making the decision. Eddie Jordan, the Jordan team&#x27;s principal, believed Whiting had made the right decision and applauded the modern Formula One car&#x27;s safety for protecting drivers.

Bernie Ecclestone, the owner of Formula One&#x27;s commercial rights, called for the removal of chicanes from racing circuits, calling them &quot;silly and unnecessary&quot;. Following that, FIA President Max Mosley announced that safety measures would be reviewed, as well as a review of the Monza track. Mosley believed that no driver was to blame for the accident but emphasised to competitors that it was their responsibility to be attentive when bunched up at a race start. Former driver Jacques Laffite advocated for an electronic warning system for marshals and thought chicanes should have been reviewed.

Gislimberti never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at hospital. The Trento-born volunteer firefighter and provincial head water control engineer, who was vice-president of the CEA Squadra Corse firefighting organisation, predeceased his wife of two years, Elena (who was pregnant with his child), and other family members. His autopsy released two days later determined he died from head trauma. On 15 September, he was given a funeral at the San Ulderico church, Lavis, attended by several drivers, friends and colleagues. Five cars involved in the crash were impounded by Italian authorities hours after the race. Magistrate Salvatore Bellomo opened a formal investigation into the crash and interviewed drivers. The investigating body examined all five cars before returning them to the teams on 12 September. The investigation was closed in June 2001 after a technical study concluded that Gislimberti was killed instantly. Following Gislimberti&#x27;s death, the strength of the wheel tethers was doubled to prevent flying tyres from endangering drivers, safety officials, and fans. The chassis would be reinforced, and improved crash resistance would be tested.
Michael Schumacher&#x27;s victory reduced Häkkinen&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to two points. Coulthard remained in third with 61 points. Barrichello&#x27;s retirement at the race ended his chances of becoming World Champion and Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s third-place finish kept him in fifth place with 24 points. Ferrari&#x27;s victory lowered McLaren&#x27;s lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to four points. Williams maintained third place with 34 points. Benetton in fourth strengthened its gap over Jordan in fifth to seven points with three races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2000 United States Grand Prix (formally the 2000 SAP United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 24 September 2000 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana before 250,000 spectators. It was the 15th round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship and Indianapolis held its first United States Grand Prix. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the 73-lap race from pole position. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second with Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen third.

Before the race, McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen led Michael Schumacher by two points in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship while McLaren led Ferrari by four points in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Michael Schumacher took pole position by setting the best lap in the one-hour qualifying session. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard started second, with Michael Schumacher. However, Coulthard had to serve a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap eight because he jumped the start. Häkkinen started third, but retired on lap 26 with a blown engine due to a pneumatic valve system failure. Michael Schumacher thus had an uncontested lead after passing Coulthard on lap seven, and despite losing control of his Ferrari in the final five circuits of the race, he went on to win his seventh race of the season and 42nd overall. Barrichello finished second, 12.1 seconds behind, and Frentzen finished third, holding off British American Racing&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve in the final laps.

Michael Schumacher retook the lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by eight points over Häkkinen following the race. Coulthard&#x27;s fifth-place finish in the Grand Prix eliminated any mathematical chance of winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship, reducing his advantage over fourth-placed Barrichello to eight points. Ferrari retook the World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead from McLaren, establishing a ten-point lead with two races left in the season.

==Background==

The 2000 United States Grand Prix, officially the &quot;SAP United States Grand Prix&quot;, was the fifteenth race of seventeen in the 2000 Formula One World Championship. Held at the clockwise Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) road course on 24 September 2000. It was the first Formula One World Championship event staged in Indianapolis since the Indianapolis 500 was part of the World Championship from to . The event was held under the auspices of the United States Auto Club (USAC), the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) member for the United States, and the Porsche Supercup and the Ferrari Challenge series held support races during the weekend. There were eleven teams of two drivers (each representing a different constructor), and all but one had never raced at Indianapolis, with no changes to the season entry list.

The event marked the United States&#x27; return to Formula One after a hiatus since . It was ended because of low attendance at its old venue in Phoenix, Arizona and it was replaced by the South African Grand Prix in the 1992 season. It was reintroduced in December 1998 after IMS president Tony George&#x27;s seven-year campaign. The road circuit was built between 2 December 1998 and 10 September 2000, ending two weeks before the Grand Prix. To celebrate the race&#x27;s return, Jaguar drivers Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert did a demonstration lap in a Jaguar R1 and a Taxicab along Broadway in New York City on Tuesday afternoon.

Going into the race, McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 80 points, ahead of Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher on 78 points, Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard on 61 points, Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello on 49 points and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher on 24 points. McLaren led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 131 points ahead of Ferrari on 127 points. Williams were third with 34 points, Benetton fourth on 20 and Jordan fifth with 17. 

Following the on 10 September, the teams largely tested aerodynamics, chassis setups and a new tyre compound from Bridgestone at on European racing circuits between 11 and 15 September to prepare for the race. Ferrari, McLaren and Sauber tested at the Mugello Circuit with one day moved to let marshals attend the funeral of fire marshal Paolo Ghislimberti, who died during the race in Italy. Olivier Panis, McLaren&#x27;s test driver, led on the first day, ahead of Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz. Panis remained fastest on the second and final days. Williams and Benetton tested at the Autódromo do Estoril circuit, with Ralf Schumacher setting fastest laps on the first and second days, and Benetton&#x27;s test driver Mark Webber leading on the third day. Jaguar and British American Racing (BAR) tested for two days at the Silverstone Circuit, led by BAR&#x27;s test driver Darren Manning and Jaguar&#x27;s test driver Luciano Burti. Luca Badoer, Ferrari&#x27;s test driver, tested aerodynamic and mechanical components and shook down four F1-2000 cars at Ferrari&#x27;s private Fiorano Circuit. Minardi tested with drivers Matteo Bobbi and Giorgio Vinella at Vairano while the Arrows and Prost teams did no testing and instead readied their cars at their respective factories for the race at Indianapolis.

At the previous race in Italy, Häkkinen&#x27;s lead over Michael Schumacher was reduced to two points after Schumacher won and Häkkinen finished second. Bookmakers put both drivers as joint favourites to win the race. With three races left in the season, Häkkinen believed that all of the last races, including the United States Grand Prix, were equally vital, and that the championship battle may last until the season-ending . Michael Schumacher stated that Ferrari&#x27;s dominance shifted to McLaren and vice versa because their cars and drivers were evenly matched, and that winning at Indianapolis would not be more difficult than at any other track, despite drivers&#x27; unfamiliarity with the layout. Coulthard was told by McLaren team owner Ron Dennis to help Häkkinen win the championship, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m now 19 points behind and although there are still 30 to be won and theoretically there&#x27;s a chance I might win the title, with just three races left it makes no sense for me to be taking points away from Mika only to allow Michael to win the championship. We will just not let that happen.&quot; Barrichello spoke with his team Ferrari and said his job was to help his teammate and hinder McLaren, &quot;The objectives are clear. We have to tighten ourselves around Michael and help bring the title back in Italy after 21 years of absence.&quot;

The track garnered largely excellent feedback, but most drivers were disappointed by the lack of challenge on the banked turn 13. Häkkinen called the track &quot;great, really enjoyable to drive and quite difficult in some parts&quot;, and Michael Schumacher said he did not find it hard to adapt to the circuit. Willams&#x27; Jenson Button described the track as a &quot;great circuit&quot;. Irvine was surprised by its layout, &quot;It has a good mix of high speed and tight turns. It&#x27;s tricky and tight – a lot of fun.&quot; However, BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve was critical, claiming that it would be &quot;very difficult to get a good lap&quot; and found the infield section &quot;very slow&quot;. Sauber&#x27;s Mika Salo disliked the first three hairpins but was satisfied with the rest of the circuit. World Champion Mario Andretti tested a car on the track and said it &quot;keeps your attention and, believe it or not, it&#x27;s got a good rhythm. It&#x27;s the kind of course that you start feeling good about as you get more laps. It invites you to shave all the little things and improve your way.&quot; Concerns over a driver error leading to a collision at turn 13 prompted the relocation of the pit lane entry line.

Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the Hard and the Extra Hard dry compound tyres to the event. Bridgestone created the extra hard tyre compound to help drivers cope with the additional demands of the Indianapolis road course. It advised teams to increase air pressures to withstand the higher cornering load through the final two corners after concerns were raised about a mechanical failure in turn 13 with a concrete barrier lining it following Ghisliberti&#x27;s death. The company and the FIA agreed to provide teams with two extra sets of tyres for Friday&#x27;s two free practice sessions in order to collect additional data and ensure that drivers were better acclimatised to the circuit. 

Teams concentrated on improving their car setups for the Indianapolis track, as well as reviewing suspension loads because cars would be stressed going through the banking. The Williams team brought a new front wing and a Ferrari-inspired sweep main profile. Arrows&#x27; car used a low-downforce layout similar to that seen at the Italian Grand Prix to gain speed on the main straight. Sauber and Williams used similar designs, but most teams eventually settled on a compromise configuration seen at the .

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. It was warm and dry for the first practice session. All drivers entered the circuit to familiarise themselves with it, with lap times gradually decreasing, which were around two seconds slower than predicted by computer simulations. Michael Schumacher led early in the first practice session, with the quickest time of 1:14.927 seconds, ahead of teammate Barrichello. Häkkinen was third although his car&#x27;s gearbox was changed. Button, Villeneuve, Benetton&#x27;s Alexander Wurz, the Jordan duo of Trulli and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Irvine and Prost&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld were in fourth through tenth. After ten minutes, an electrical fault prevented Coulthard from establishing a fast lap time as marshals pulled him onto the circuit from the pit lane entry, preventing him from participating in the rest of practice under series regulations. Giancarlo Fisichella removed his Benetton&#x27;s left-front wheel in a crash at the turn 11 tyre barrier. Ralf Schumacher slowed on course with a front-left wheel bearing failure.

It remained sunny for the second session, during which drivers experimented with car setups as teams became more familiar with the track. Coulthard set the day&#x27;s fastest lap at 1:14.561, one tenth of a second faster than teammate Häkkinen 27 minutes in. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello fell to third and fourth fastest, respectively, after failing to better their lap times, even though both drivers expressed satisfaction with their performance. Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Trulli, Button, Minardi&#x27;s Marc Gené and Villeneuve followed in the top ten. Herbert crashed, losing control of his Jaguar when braking and veering left into the outside turn one tyre barrier, damaging his car&#x27;s left-rear wheel and ending his practice early. His car went down an escape road and marshals moved him off the circuit. Jean Alesi lost control of his Prost car at turn four, getting stuck in a gravel trap near the barriers.

The Saturday morning sessions were run in cloudy conditions on a damp track with patches of standing water from overnight rain, resulting in minimal grip and some drivers going off the circuit. Warm weather improved conditions gradually throughout practice, but lap times were generally slower than the previous day. Häkkinen set the third session&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:15.802; Coulthard was third. Button ran quicker and was second. Both Ferrari drivers were fourth and fifth–Barrichello ahead of Michael Schumacher. Fisichella, Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Verstappen and Diniz followed in the top ten. Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, and Wurz all left the track at various points in the session, but all three were able to resume driving.

As the course dried out during the last practice session, drivers began to lose their vehicle balances. Both Ferraris maintained their fast performance; Michael Schumacher was the fastest driver, with a lap of 1:14.804. Barrichello was second. Button separated the McLaren drivers—Coulthard in third and Häkkinen in fifth—who remained fast. Frentzen, sixth, found it a struggle to adapt to the changing conditions. Fisichella, Villeneuve, Ralf Schumacher and Trulli made up positions seven through ten. During the session, Gené and Michael Schumacher lost control of their vehicles and ran off the track, although both were able to continue driving. A passing car dislodged part of a track marking, which a marshal removed from the circuit.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in cloudy skies with periodic rain showers. Meteorologists predicted a 70% probability of rain, so several drivers concerned over a downpower went onto the circuit early on as a precaution; the downpour never materialised. Michael Schumacher adjusted his rear wing angle and went out of teammate Barrichello&#x27;s slipstream to drive quicker on the main straight into turn one after the latter aborted a run, fearful that McLaren may lap faster despite their MP4/15 cars having more downforce. He took his seventh pole position of the season and 30th of his career with a lap time of 1:14.266 set seven minutes in. Coulthard was second, one-tenth of a second slower after going from fourth to second. Coulthard was aided by running in Häkkinen&#x27;s slipstream for more speed through turn 13 and the start of the main straight before his teammate let him pass at the start of the former&#x27;s final quick lap after being asked over the radio by McLaren technical director Adrian Newey if it would help. Häkkinen qualified third after completing nearly all of the 12 allowed laps and having no time for a final run, saying he was not disappointed to start from third. Barrichello qualified fourth, three-tenths of a second behind Michael Schumacher, after being too far behind to benefit from his teammate&#x27;s slipstream. He said he had more grip in his car to improve his time but had a minor understeer. Trulli qualified sixth late in the session after replacing his car&#x27;s engine due to issues during practice. Button took sixth on his third run due to a yellow flag for Alesi&#x27;s engine failure. He acknowledged pushing too hard at the first corner on his fourth attempt, despite encouragement from his team. 

Frentzen, seventh, reported grip troubles in the infield and slid onto the grass at turn eight. Villeneuve, eighth, felt he should have lapped quicker after spinning at the turn nine hairpin while on his final set of qualifying tyres. Diniz qualified ninth, a season best, after improving the car&#x27;s feel by removing some downforce. Ralf Schumacher, tenth, had car setup issues that compromised handling, and he spun onto the turn eight grass on his fourth attempt. Wurz qualified 11th and expressed satisfaction with his car after his engineers modified the setup. BAR&#x27;s Ricardo Zonta qualified 12th on his second run, blaming understeer. He was ahead of Verstappen, who made a driving error, and Salo noted his car did not operate well with a low fuel load and had car balance issues, causing it to go from excess understeer to oversteer. Fisichella, 15th, said understeer and poor grip prevented him from lapping faster but Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore blamed the driver for his performance. He qualified ahead of Heidfeld in 16th and Irvine in 17th, who adjusted his car&#x27;s wing settings from one run to another, and spun at turn seven. Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa took 18th after an error on his final quick lap and nearly collided with a Jaguar on a previous run. Herbert, 19th, drove a difficult to handle car and Alesi took 20th after lacking running due to a pneumatic valve engine system failure, forcing him to go off the circuit after turn ten with smoke billowing from the car&#x27;s rear. The two Minardi drivers qualified in 21st and 22nd, with Gastón Mazzacane ahead of Gené. Both drivers experienced understeer, failing to equal their previous day&#x27;s times.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
A 30-minute warm-up session was held on the morning of the race in cool, damp, and  overcast weather following heavy overnight rain, with poor grip and many drivers going off the track onto the grass. Drivers were keen to test their cars on the damp track, and some tested wet-weather tyres, which overheated in the banking and on the main straight. Some teams put dry tyres on their cars shortly before the session ended. Coulthard set the fastest time, a 1:23.14, with six minutes to go. Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher and Villeneuve were in the next three places. Diniz spun at turn seven before the back straight, Trulli went across the gravel trap at turn 11, Heidfeld slid into the turn one run-off area and Irvine spun at turn eight during the session.

The FIA safety delegate, Charlie Whiting, moved the grid&#x27;s front row back the previous night after concerns were raised by Coulthard and Michael Schumacher who experienced wheelspin while crossing the &quot;Yard of Bricks&quot; laid in the track, which stretched from its outside edge to the pit lane. They were concerned that when the race began from a standing start, their cars would lose traction or crash. Whiting also had the pit lane speed limit zone advanced deeper between turns 12 and 13 and raised the speed limit from to after most drivers raised concerns over the high speeds entering the pit lane during the race arising from incidents there during practice.

==Race==
The Grand Prix began at 13:00 Eastern Time after the FIA moved the race&#x27;s start time by an hour from 14:00 local time for unknown reasons. The conditions on the grid were dry and damp before the race; the air temperature was between and the track temperature between . Approximately 250,000 people attended the race, breaking the record set at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Every driver, except Herbert, began on the intermediate compound tyre when heavy rain fell between the end of warm-up and just before the afternoon, making the track much wetter; no more rain was forecast however the oval section dried quickly but the infield did not since there was still standing water there, making it slippery. Before any driver moved off the starting grid, Coulthard jumped the start by releasing the clutch too soon, taking the lead into turn one. The stewards investigated Coulthard for the jump start and reviewed video footage. Häkkinen held off Barrichello&#x27;s attempts to pass him for third going into turn one. Herbert fell from 19th to 22nd by the end of the first lap. Frentzen lost seventh place mid-lap after going wide, dropping two positions to Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher. 

At the end of the first lap, Coulthard led from Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Trulli and Button. Coulthard had a 1.7-second lead over Michael Schumacher by the end of lap two. Button attempted to overtake Trulli for seventh on the back straight, but the two collided. Both drivers went off the track and made pit stops to replace rear punctures, dropping to the back of the field. Frentzen overtook Ralf Schumacher for sixth place, Zonta passed Diniz for eighth, while Verstappen advanced two spots to tenth after passing Irvine and Wurz. On lap three, De La Rosa passed Heidfeld for 13th place, and Gené passed Fisichella for 17th. Coulthard&#x27;s lead over Michael Schumacher was cut to one second on the following lap. De La Rosa moved up the field by passing Wurz for twelfth. On lap five, Alesi became the first driver to make a pit stop for dry tyres. The first three drivers were close together, and Michael Schumacher, having generated enough heat in his tyres, began attacking Coulthard for the lead on the same lap that the latter was asked to slow down in order to slow Schumacher and allow his teammate Häkkinen to close in and challenge the Ferrari driver. Michael Schumacher came closer on Coulthard in the infield segment, challenging him for the lead. 

Michael Schumacher unsuccessfully tried to overtake Coulthard on the outside on the start/finish straight at the start of lap six. Coulthard&#x27;s blocking of Schumacher allowed Häkkinen to close up and almost pass on the inside. Barrichello was the first of the frontrunners to make a pit stop at the end of the same lap, while Irvine lost eleventh to De La Rosa. By this point, the track had dried enough for teams to change tyres, but several drivers struggled to generate temperature into the hard dry compound tyres, with Barrichello&#x27;s car balance deteriorating, resulting in excess oversteer due to the recommended high tyre pressures ensuring the tyres flexed less. Michael Schumacher successfully attempted to pass Coulthard on the outside of the start/finish straight into turn one on lap seven. Both drivers made minor contact and Michael Schumacher left the corner ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher began to pull away from the field, with no one to hinder him. Häkkinen was let through into second place by teammate Coulthard, who entered the pit lane and prompted numerous cars to switch to dry tyres on lap seven, including Ralf Schumacher, Zonta, Verstappen, Irvine, and Wurz. Button&#x27;s better lap times on the dry tyres encouraged other drivers to make pit stops. 

The stewards handed Coulthard a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap eight, and he was summoned to the pit lane at the end of the lap to serve the penalty. Despite nearly colliding with De La Rosa after serving the penalty, Coulthard dropped from second to sixth place, while Fisichella served an identical penalty on the same lap and remained in 22nd. Michael Schumacher, Frentzen, Diniz and Mazzacane were the only drivers not to change tyres by lap nine, while Coulthard returned to the pit lane to make his pit stop for dry tyres due to the track drying. He rejoined in 16th, behind Gené. Over the next three laps, De La Rosa and Zonta traded twelfth, while Ralf Schumacher passed Barrichello for seventh. Diniz, who was running third, made a pit stop on lap twelve and emerged in sixth. Both Williams drivers began trading fastest laps on that lap. Mazzacane, who had decided to stay on wet-weather tyres, began battling Häkkinen&#x27;s attempts to overtake him on lap 13, losing the latter around 13 seconds while Ralf Schumacher passed Diniz for sixth. Trulli&#x27;s mechanics did not have the correct tyres ready for his pit stop on the same lap, and the left-rear wheel nut did not appear to be replaced. He then stopped on the side of the track after turn one, retiring with a broken suspension caused by his earlier accident with Button. Frentzen and Mazzacane made their pit stops on lap 14, allowing Häkkinen into second. Button retired his car alongside the barrier on the inside of the start/finish straight a lap later with an engine failure, possibly caused by his car bottoming out on the Yard of Bricks.

Michael Schumacher made a pit stop for fuel and tyres at the end of lap 16, taking seven seconds. He re-emerged in first place, sixteen seconds ahead of Häkkinen, who began steadily reducing Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead. Herbert passed Barrichello in turn one and battled Diniz for sixth on lap 18, but had to brake hard as Diniz defended at the turn. Diniz went off the track at turn eight, and Herbert and Villeneuve overtook him. Barrichello overtook Diniz for eighth at turn one on lap 19. Salo spun backwards into the gravel trap at turn three on the same lap, becoming the race&#x27;s third retirement after becoming stuck in the gravel and unable to extricate himself. Seven laps later, Häkkinen had cut Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead to four seconds with a string of fastest laps. This was before Häkkinen&#x27;s pneumatic valve system failed due to a faulty engine component, resulting in a complete engine failure. Flames and smoke billowed from Häkkinen&#x27;s rear-left engine exhaust banks, and he retired at the pit lane entry. This moved Ralf Schumacher to second and Frentzen to third.

Herbert had a problematic pit stop on lap 28. He ran into a puddle entering the pit lane, and a wheelchanger dropped his wheel gun on Herbert&#x27;s front wing, which had to be replaced. Herbert returned to the track in 17th. Coulthard passed Irvine for ninth two laps later. Verstappen&#x27;s brake balance system failed on lap 35, causing him to lock the rear brakes and crash straight into the turn eight tyre wall. This promoted Diniz into the points-paying positions in sixth. Coulthard continued to gain positions, passing de la Rosa for seventh on lap 37 after a previous attempt at turn one failed. Coulthard attempted to overtake Diniz on the following lap but failed due to a lack of slipstream, and Diniz defended sixth. On lap 39, Coulthard succeeded the second time round by passing Diniz on the inside at the turn one braking zone. Ralf Schumacher was the first driver to make a planned pit stop on that lap. On lap 40, Villeneuve was closing in on Frentzen in second place when he spun 180 degrees at turn nine, allowing Barrichello to pass him from third. 

That same lap, Coulthard set the race&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:14.710. He made a pit stop for fuel and tyres one lap later, rejoining in eleventh after a 9.6-second stop. Dalf Schumacher had a 24.3-second pit stop on the following lap because his engine&#x27;s leaking pneumatic valve system needed to be recharged. De La Rosa retired on the start/finish straight alongside the pit lane barrier when his gearbox failed while he was in fifth gear on lap 46, and Fisichella retired in the pit lane one lap later with smoke spewing from his engine as he approached the pit entry. Race leader Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 49, retaining a ten-second lead over Frentzen. Mazzacane made a pit stop on lap 51 and missed his stopping position, causing some pit lane equipment to be pulled and injuring front-right wheel changer Ricardo Pozzati and refueller Sandro Parrini. Both men were brought to the infield hospital for x-ray examinations after suffering minor injuries in the crash. 

Ferrari brought their pit crew to position themselves for what appeared to be for a pit stop for Barrichello, therefore Frentzen entered the pit lane on that lap, believing that Barrichello was stopping. Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn instructed Barrichello to stay on the track and lap quickly because his car had less fuel, before becoming the final driver to make a planned pit stop on lap 53. He rejoined the track in second. By the end of lap 55, after the scheduled pit stops, the order was Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Frentzen, Villeneuve, Coulthard and Diniz. Diniz made a pit stop on lap 59 to fix a handling issue and dropped to tenth. Ralf Schumacher retired from the race due to his pneumatic valve system fault, prompting Williams to switch off the engine to prevent damage two laps later. Mazzacane stopped his car on the grass at turn 11 on lap 62, retiring with smoke billowing from the rear. Villeneuve (with his more powerful Honda engine) attempted to pass Frentzen for third into turn one on lap 65, but he braked too late and skidded onto the grass on the outside of the corner, allowing Frentzen to stay in third.

Alesi became the race&#x27;s final retirement when his engine failed, causing him to spin backwards at turn eight on the following lap, almost being hit by his teammate Heidfeld. Three laps later, Michael Schumacher spun 270 degrees after landing his right-front wheel on the damp grass at turn nine&#x27;s hairpin due to a lack of focus. He did not hit anything, was able to keep the engine going without stalling and retained the lead. Schumacher crossed the start/finish line on lap 73 for his seventh win of the season and 42nd overall. His teammate Barrichello finished second 12.1 seconds behind. Frentzen finished third for the second time in the season, beating off a late-race attack from Villeneuve in fourth, half a second behind him. Coulthard was unable to push as hard as he would have liked on his second set of tyres, finishing fifth, while Zonta finished sixth for the second consecutive race. Irvine in seventh was the last driver on the lead lap, with Diniz, Heidfeld, Wurz, Herbert, and Gené the final classified finishers, albeit one lap behind.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher explained that his late-race spin was caused to a lack of concentration when his team instructed him to slow down. Nonetheless, he expressed happiness with his win and declared that his team would focus on claiming the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; championships. According to Barrichello, wet-weather tyres allowed him to lap two seconds faster than dry tyres. He also stated that, despite having an advantage on the wet track, he had struggled with significant oversteer and maintaining his car on a high fuel load after his pit stop. During the post-race interview, Frentzen described his race as &quot;hard&quot; because of the amount of time spent passing other drivers. He also praised his team&#x27;s performance following a series of poor results.

Villeneuve expressed disappointment for losing out on a third-place finish, which would have been his team&#x27;s first podium position: &quot;Today was a lot of fun and we were really quick in the race, but it&#x27;s frustrating to get so close to a podium. I made a couple of mistakes, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference in the end.&quot; Coulthard expressed disappointment at his jump-start and apologised. Zonta was delighted to finish sixth, noting that his competitors were faster early in the race due to fuel loads, but he was able to keep up with them. Häkkinen was disappointed to retire from the race and felt &quot;it could have been interesting by the end of the race&quot; since he was gaining on Michael Schumacher, saying, &quot;I mean, this is not good, but we still have two races. Anything can happen.&quot; Mercedes-Benz motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug apologised to Häkkinen for the engine failure.

After the race, Michael Schumacher accused Coulthard of &quot;unsporting behaviour&quot; in the battle for the race lead. The accusation emerged following Coulthard&#x27;s minor collision with Schumacher, who claimed Coulthard was driving dangerously: &quot;He [Coulthard] ran in a way that he thought it [touching] could happen, and he didn&#x27;t try to avoid that, that&#x27;s pretty simple. As he is not fighting for the championship...I just want to make sure that we don&#x27;t see teammates helping the drivers fighting for the championship in the way which is not appropriate.&quot; Coulthard denied any wrongdoing: &quot;I could have easily pushed him off the circuit. But I didn&#x27;t and I won&#x27;t in the future because it is not sporting and it is not the way I do things.&quot; Trulli and Button had a similar ill-feeling following their collision on lap two, the second in three races. Trulli called the Williams driver an &quot;idiot&quot; and accused him of &quot;driving like a crazy&quot;. Button suggested that Trulli had moved towards him slightly, despite believing he had taken the right line. He also believed Trulli moved towards him while braking.

A total of 15 out of 20 Indianapolis 500 winners lauded the race&#x27;s first running in Indianapolis. Danny Sullivan, the 1985 Indianapolis 500 winner, praised the race organisers&#x27; efforts: &quot;Tony George has done a phenomenal job of integrating it into (the schedule) and not losing the integrity of the current Indianapolis 500 track. I think this shows this is the place it (Formula One) should be.&quot; Emerson Fittipaldi, the 1993 winner and double Formula One World Champion, believed that it would begin in a new era of Formula One racing in the United States. Fittipaldi&#x27;s opinion was echoed by 1998 winner Eddie Cheever, who believed the race would encourage more Americans to enter Formula One. The race received the Race Promoters&#x27; Trophy at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony in Monte Carlo in December 2000.

As a result of the race, Michael Schumacher reclaimed the lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 88 points, for the second time in the 2000 season. Häkkinen&#x27;s failure to finish lost him the Drivers&#x27; Championship lead, leaving him eight points behind Michael Schumacher. Coulthard finished fifth and stayed third, 25 points behind Michael Schumacher, eliminating his chances of winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship. The McLaren team&#x27;s poor results, along with Ferrari&#x27;s one-two finish, resulted in Ferrari retaking the lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, ten points ahead of McLaren with two races in the season remaining.

<text>The 2000 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the XXVI Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 8 October 2000, in front of 151,000 people at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Mie, Japan. It was the 26th Japanese Grand Prix and the 16th and penultimate race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 53-lap race from pole position. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard finished second and third, respectively. Schumacher&#x27;s victory confirmed him as the 2000 World Drivers&#x27; Champion, as Häkkinen could not overtake Schumacher&#x27;s points total with one race remaining in the season.

Only Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen were in contention for the World Drivers&#x27; Championship entering the race, with Schumacher leading by eight points. Ferrari led McLaren in the World Constructors Championship by ten points. Häkkinen began alongside Michael Schumacher on the grid&#x27;s first row. Michael Schumacher attempted to defend the lead off the line by moving into Häkkinen&#x27;s path, but Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher into the first corner, with Coulthard holding off attempts by Williams driver Ralf Schumacher to get into third. Michael Schumacher closed up to Häkkinen by lap 31 and overtaking him during the second round of pit stops. He maintained his lead over Häkkinen to the end of the race to claim his eighth victory of the season.

Many Formula One individuals praised Michael Schumacher, including former champion Jody Scheckter and Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, but was criticised by former Italian president Francesco Cossiga for his behaviour on the podium during the playing of the Italian National Anthem. The European press congratulated the Ferrari driver as well. Häkkinen&#x27;s second-place finish secured him second in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, while Ferrari increased its lead over McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to thirteen points with one race remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2000 Japanese Grand Prix was held on 8 October 2000 at the clockwise figure-of-eight Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Mie, Japan, the 16th and penultimate round of the 2000 Formula One World Championship. The event was contested by eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) comprising two drivers, with no changes from the season entry list. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone sent the Medium dry compound as opposed to two dry compounds as it had one all-season, as well as the intermediate and full wet-weather compounds, to the event. The circuit was altered slightly in preparation for the race. To increase safety, the pit lane entry was moved from the end of the 130R&#x27;s left-hand corner to the exit of the Casio chicane.

Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 88 points before the race, followed by McLaren teammates Mika Häkkinen on 80 and David Coulthard on 63. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 55 points with Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher fifth with 24 points. The remaining two races had a maximum of 20 points available, therefore Häkkinen could still win the championship. Michael Schumacher had to win the race regardless of where Häkkinen finished because he would be more than ten points ahead of him with one race remaining. Otherwise, Häkkinen could win the Championship by outscoring Schumacher in the final race of the season in Malaysia. Michael Schumacher would win the Championship on win count-back if there was a points tie. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 143 points, followed by McLaren and Williams with 133 and 34 points, respectively. Jordan were fifth with 17 points behind Benetton in fourth with 20.

Häkkinen retired from the preceding due to a pneumatic valve failure. With two races left in the season and an eight-point disadvantage after losing the Drivers&#x27; Championship lead, Häkkinen remained optimistic about his title chances: &quot;I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two.&quot; He approached the event similarly to the others. Michael Schumacher having won the two previous races, emphasised the pressure of leading the championship entering Japan: &quot;It hasn&#x27;t been a relaxing time at all and I still haven&#x27;t completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I&#x27;m prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And the same can be said of the entire team.&quot; Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter urged Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly after their teams ordered both drivers to support their teammates in the Championship battle.

Following the United States Grand Prix on September 24, the teams tested at various European racing circuits between 26 and 29 September in preparation for the race. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis tested at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours to prepare for Suzuka and work on the 2001 car. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent two days at the Fiorano Circuit evaluating mechanical components and Bridgestone&#x27;s wet weather tyre compounds on an artificially wet track. Williams spent two days at the Circuito do Estoril testing wet weather tyres and different aerodynamic setups with rookie Jenson Button. Stéphane Sarrazin, Prost&#x27;s test driver, collected chassis design data for the future AP04 chassis at Magny-Cours. Benetton did not test but its test driver Mark Webber tried developments at the Circuit de Catalunya that were incorporated into their 2001 car.

At the Friday afternoon drivers meeting, Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) Race Director Charlie Whiting announced that any potential blocking manoeuvres that interfered with the World Championship battle would result in a driver being shown a waved black and white flag to indicate unsportsmanlike conduct, followed by a black flag to signal disqualification from the race. Any driver found to have violated the new rule might also have faced a three-race ban. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. McLaren team principal Ron Dennis, however, was more vocal in his opposition to the new rules, believing they were arbitrary and were against choosing tactics for his team. He was particularly dissatisfied with the appointment of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo (who represented Ferrari at the 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix) as a race steward, believing that any ruling would favour Ferrari.

Some teams had modified their cars for the event, but with only two races left in the season, several teams instead focused on developing the cars that they would enter in the 2001 season. Ferrari introduced a rectangular-shaped front wing, replacing an arrow-shaped front wing. Honda introduced a more powerful version of its V10 engine for Saturday&#x27;s qualifying and the race. Sauber brought lighter components to lighten their vehicles, while Williams supplied a revised back wing. Williams engine suppliers BMW ran the same engine specification introduced in Belgium.

==Practice==
Two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday preceded Sunday&#x27;s race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions were held in dry, warm weather. Because teams were not permitted to test at Suzuka, several drivers entered the circuit for car checks. Michael Schumacher was the fastest in the first practice session, lapping at 1:38.474 with two minutes remaining, ahead of Häkkinen and Coulthard in second and third. When fourth-placed Barrichello spun at the hairpin between turns ten and eleven and crashed into the perimeter fencing, the session was yellow flagged. Ralf Schumacher was fifth fastest, with Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella sixth. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jarno Trulli were seventh and ninth, separated by Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine. BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve was tenth despite a spin off the circuit at Degner Curve, causing grass to penetrate his radiators.

In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher set the day&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:37.728, six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. On his final run, Barrichello struggled to select first gear, but he improved his lap to third fastest. Coulthard, Button, Frentzen, Trulli, Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa, Villeneuve and BAR&#x27;s Ricardo Zonta were in positions four through ten. Villeneuve had his second spin of the day, when he lost control of his car at Spoon Kurve turn on his final lap. He hit the barrier with his car&#x27;s right-front wheel. While cars were being driven on the track, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake was felt at Suzuka, though no structural damage to the circuit was reported and no one was injured despite the mild alarm.

Saturday morning&#x27;s practice sessions were held in dry and warm weather. Michael Schumacher had the quickest time in the third practise, a 1:37.176, which was faster than his best time on Friday. Ralf Schumacher was second and Button was fourth. Coulthard, in third, ran wide at the exit of Spoon Curve turn and returned to the course after driving into the gravel. Fisichella set the fifth-fastest lap, ahead of Villeneuve, who spun into the gravel at the hairpin late in practice and had to walk to the pit lane. Barrichello, Irvine, Jaguar&#x27;s Johnny Herbert and De La Rosa completed the top ten. Ten minutes into practice, the engine in Pedro Diniz&#x27;s Sauber car failed; smoke and fire billowed from the rear of his car, and a large amount of oil was laid on the track. He returned to the pit lane rather than stop at the side of the track. Some drivers slid on the oil.

With 15 minutes remaining in the last practice session, Häkkinen lapped fastest at 1:37.037, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher. Button, third, was happy with his car&#x27;s performance. Despite another spin into the gravel traps, Barrichello maintained his consistent performance and was fourth-fastest. He was ahead of Ralf Schumacher, who had his fastest lap invalidated after breaching track limits at the chicane when he braked too late with ten minutes left. Coulthard was sixth, two-tenths of a second quicker than Fisichella, who finished seventh. Irvine, Benetton&#x27;s Alexander Wurz and Villeneuve completed the top ten. Irvine had a throttle system fault and ran wide into the gravel at the Spoon Curve corner. He rejoined the track by following the gravel&#x27;s perimeter. Villeneuve spun into the gravel trap for the fourth time, but was able to rejoin to the track.

==Qualifying==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. Qualifying was held in dry weather. Michael Schumacher secured his eighth pole position of the season, the 31st of his Formula One career, with a lap of 1:35.825 set with three minutes remaining after Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn sent him into a gap in traffic. Häkkinen, who was nine thousandths of a second slower than Schumacher and battled him for grid position throughout qualifying, joined him on the front row after being slow exiting the final turn. Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate Coulthard qualified third, closing in on the session&#x27;s quickest two qualifiers. He conceded that despite making some car tweaks, he was not quick enough to fight for pole position. Both Williams drivers qualified on the third row of the grid, with Button in fifth and Ralf Schumacher in sixth. Both drivers had mixed feelings with their performances; Ralf Schumacher was unable to deal with car setup changes. Button&#x27;s first two timed laps were hampered by Häkkinen and Trulli, and he lapped fastest on his third try. Irvine, seventh, was slow into certain turns and had braking issues. Frentzen, eighth, reported driving a difficult-to-handle car.

Villeneuve, ninth, had excess oversteer and failed to lap faster due to car alterations. Herbert, tenth, felt he could have qualified on the fourth row with a setup adjustment. Wurz, eleventh, missed qualifying for the top ten by nearly two thousands of a second due to a lack of top speed. His teammate Fisichella started 12th after his car lost performance after morning practice. Both Arrows drivers were on the seventh row--De La Rosa was faster than Verstappen--and their cars were hampered by water leaks, electrical and hydraulic issues. Trulli, 15th, struggled with car power steering in high-speed corners and poor car balance. Nick Heidfeld qualified 16th, ahead of Prost teammate Jean Alesi. Zonta, 18th, had reduced qualifying time due to an engine change. Sauber secured the tenth row, with Mika Salo ahead of Diniz, who struggled with traction and understeer. Salo used a spare Sauber vehicle setup for Diniz because his race car had a broken electrical connection. Two of Diniz&#x27;s fastest qualifying times were disallowed due to him laying oil on the circuit and not stopping in the morning practice sessions. Marc Gené qualified 21st, ahead of Gastón Mazzacane in 22nd place for the two Minardi drivers. Due to a sudden rise in gear oil temperature, Gené drove the spare Minardi car, and Mazzacane made an error within the first part of his lap.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 10:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC +9) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It was held in overcast weather, with a few drops of rain falling before the session began. This rendered the circuit damp, but it dried fast, and teams switched from wet to dry compound tyres. As competitors practised their starts, teams fine-tuned their cars&#x27; handling while running high fuel loads. Michael Schumacher set the quickest overall lap of 1:38.005 on his final fast attempt. His teammate Barrichello finished third in the other Ferrari. McLaren drivers separated them—Häkkinen was second and Coulthard was fourth. Button set the fifth-fastest lap. Mazzacane lost control of his car in the final curve of the esses behind the pit lane with ten minutes left in warm-up, sustaining heavy car damage against the barrier.

==Race==
The 53-lap race ran over before approximately 151,000 people from 14:30 local time. The weather was dry and overcast for the race; forecasters predicted rain during the event. The air temperature was at and the track temperature at . During the final parade lap, Häkkinen&#x27;s car developed a hydraulic system leak, causing oil to drip out of an overflow tank and hit the engine and emit smoke but was able to start. Frentzen began the race in Jordan&#x27;s spare monocoque. When the lights went out to start the race, extra track grip allowed Häkkinen to accelerate faster than Michael Schumacher off the line. He held off Schumacher&#x27;s attempts to maintain the lead by veering right towards the McLaren car in an attempt to block his path into the first corner. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s manoeuvre created some action behind the leading two drivers on the approach into the first corner, as Ralf Schumacher overtook Barrichello and Coulthard resisted Schumacher&#x27;s attempts to pass for third. Verstappen advanced from 14th to ninth at the end of the first lap, while Fisichella&#x27;s anti-stall system activated, making a slow getaway and dropping eight positions.

At the completion of lap one, Häkkinen led Michael Schumacher by eight-tenths of a second, followed by Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, Irvine, Barrichello and Button (who had an overheating clutch). Häkkinen set the race&#x27;s fastest lap on lap two and began to maintain the gap on Michael Schumacher as both drivers drew away from the rest of the field. A light drizzle fell on the circuit on the fourth lap, but it was not heavy enough to effect the race. On lap seven, Villeneuve overtook Herbert for eighth place, while Trulli passed his teammate Frentzen from 11th. Verstappen coasted over the circuit with electronic gearbox issues and was pushed into the garage, becoming the race&#x27;s first retirement on lap ten. Diniz took his first pit stop on lap 13, starting the first round of pit stops. At the front, Häkkinen extended his lead over Michael Schumacher to two seconds, who was ten seconds ahead of Coulthard in third. Ralf Schumacher was 8.8 seconds behind Coulthard but pulling away from Irvine in fifth. Further back, Trulli made a pit stop from tenth on lap 17 due to him being fuelled light to gain track position. He fell to 18th. Irvine was the first of the front runners to make a pit stop on the following lap, emerging behind Frentzen. Wurz, Herbert, Salo, and Heidfeld all made pit stops on lap 19, while Trulli lost time after going off the circuit. Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, Frentzen, De La Rosa, and Fisichella made their first pit stops on lap 20. Barrichello and Button made pit stops on the next lap and rejoined ahead of Irvine. Alesi retired from the race on lap 21 due to an engine failure that spilled oil on the track, and spun on his own oil in either turns four or five. Häkkinen&#x27;s team requested that he make a pit stop earlier than planned on lap 22. Michael Schumacher led one lap before Brawn called him into the pit lane for extra fuel on lap 23. He fell behind Häkkinen since his pit stop was slightly longer. Coulthard led for one lap until making his first pit stop on lap 24, handing the lead to teammate Häkkinen. On the same lap, Villeneuve passed Irvine into turn 16 for eighth.

Every driver had made pit stops by the end of lap 25. Häkkinen was first, followed by Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, and Button. Häkkinen set a new fastest lap of the race on lap 26, a 1:39.189, extending his lead over Michael Schumacher to 2.9 seconds. Trulli became the first driver to make a second pit stop on lap 28. Light rain began to fall on lap 30 and the track started to become slippery. After Häkkinen was slowed by de la Rosa&#x27;s car in the chicane on the same lap, the gap between him and Michael Schumacher fell by one second. Lap times slowed after that as the track became slippery. Ralf Schumacher lost sixth to teammate Button after an error on the same lap, while Frentzen retired at the entry of First Curve due to a hydraulic pump failure that caused his gearbox to fail. Michael Schumacher closed to 0.7 seconds behind Häkkinen by lap 31, although he narrowly avoided hitting Zonta who went off the racing line to allow him past on the entry to the chicane two laps later. Further back, Heidfeld overtook Trulli for 13th on lap 34.

The second round of pit stops began on the same lap when Irvine made a pit stop. Häkkinen made his second stop on lap 37 to avoid the battling Jaguars ahead of him, exiting 25.8 seconds behind Michael Schumacher but ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher began immediately pulling away from Häkkinen; he radioed Brawn that he was nearing slower vehicles and asked whether he should make his last pit stop earlier than planned. Brawn told Michael Schumacher to stay on the track for the time being. Coulthard, Barrichello and Button remained in third, fourth and fifth espectively, during their second stops on lap 38 and 39. Wurz retired after spinning sideways exiting the chicane on lap 40. Michael Schumacher missed Wurz&#x27;s stationary vehicle, and lost time manoeuvring past it. Wurz then reversed backwards as Häkkinen went by. Schumacher made his final pit stop on the same lap, emerging 4.1 seconds in front of Häkkinen, with his stop being 1.2 seconds faster than Häkkinen&#x27;s. He had gained five seconds on Häkkinen despite encountering the two Jaguars and Wurz. Ralf Schumacher became the race&#x27;s sixth retirement when he lost control of his car&#x27;s rear mounting a kerb and spun into the gravel trap while attempting to lap Gené at turn two on lap 42. This promoted Villeneuve to the final points-paying position of sixth. Heidfeld became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap.

At the conclusion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the top six drivers were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Coulthard, Barrichello, Button, and Villeneuve. On lap 43, Heidfeld retired due to a left-front suspension component failure, while De La Rosa passed Fisichella for 13th. Fisichella was forced onto the gravel to avoid contact. Three laps later, the rain intensified slightly, and both Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen became more circumspect. De La Rosa overtook Trulli during the 48th lap. Gené retired with a failed engine at the hairpin on the same lap. Although Häkkinen closed the gap over the final 14 laps, Michael Schumacher maintained the lead to win his eighth race of the 2000 season and 43rd of his career, in a time of 1&#x27;29:53.435, at an average speed of . Michael Schumacher won the 2000 Drivers&#x27; Championship as Häkkinen could not catch his points total in the one remaining race. He also became Ferrari&#x27;s first World Drivers&#x27; Champion since Jody Scheckter in 1979. Häkkinen skidded on a set of tyres he could not generate heat into and finished second, 1.8 seconds behind, ahead of teammate Coulthard in third with Barrichello fourth. Button finished fifth and was gaining on Barrichello by the finish. Villeneuve completed the points scorers in sixth. Herbert, Irvine, Zonta, Salo, Diniz, De La Rosa, Trulli, Fisichella and Mazzacane were the final classified finishers.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher revealed that he was careful when the track became slippery owing to rain during the second stint. He also added that his team made adjustments during the first stop, which contributed to his fast pace. Häkkinen congratulated Michael Schumacher on winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship and said that, while he was naturally disappointed, &quot;to be a good winner, sometimes you have to be a good loser.&quot; He also confessed that Ferrari&#x27;s tactics cost him a chance at victory and admitted that Schumacher had an advantage after his second pit stop. Coulthard described his race as &quot;quiet&quot; because of the lack of action he encountered. He also admitted that he struggled to handle his car in the wet.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s championship victory was well received by the Formula One paddock and the media. German national newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; said: &quot;A dream has been fulfilled and it will have far-reaching consequences. Ferrari and Formula One are alive again in this season and a new monument has been created ...Hard work and self-sacrifice have been rewarded.&quot; Across Italy, events were held to celebrate Michael Schumacher&#x27;s championship victory. Candido Cannavò, director of the Italian sports newspaper &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; described the moment as: &quot;On the dawn of a luminous autumn Sunday Ferrari reconciled itself with history.&quot;

Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo described Michael Schumacher&#x27;s title victory as the &quot;most beautiful day of my life&quot;. He also thanked the Ferrari team, their worldwide fan base, Ferrari&#x27;s majority owner FIAT, and the team&#x27;s sponsors and suppliers for their continued support. Scheckter praised both Ferrari and Michael Schumacher, but expressed disappointment at losing his status as Ferrari&#x27;s last World Champion. Todt said Ferrari would not be fully satisfied until they had won the World Constructors&#x27; Championship: &quot;We need three points for the constructors&#x27; title and we won&#x27;t let go. But let&#x27;s not worry about the future right now. Let&#x27;s enjoy the present for at least five minutes.&quot; However, former Italian President Francesco Cossiga criticised Michael Schumacher&#x27;s behaviour during the Italian National Anthem, where the German traditionally imitated a conductor when it was played. Michael Schumacher apologised if his behaviour was seen as disrespectful and that he respected the national anthem.

Off track, the argument over the new race rules and the inclusion of lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward was renewed. FIA president Max Mosley published a letter to Ron Dennis dated 19 October accusing him of tarnishing Formula One with his recent statements on the issues. Mosley also backed Whiting&#x27;s proposal for the use flags to eliminate unsportsmanlike racing. Dennis apologised for his statements, saying he did not mean to bring Formula One into disrepute or to disrespect Causo. &quot;It certainly has not ever been my intention to damage a sport to which I have devoted most of my working life.&quot; he said. Williams technical director Patrick Head commended Button&#x27;s performance in the changing conditions that saw him finish fifth, saying: &quot;He drove an absolutely brilliant, very mature race and thoroughly deserved fifth position.&quot;

As a result of the race, Michael Schumacher won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with a twelve-point lead over Häkkinen, who was confirmed as the Championship runner-up. Coulthard maintained third with 67 points, nine ahead of Barrichello and 43 ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Ferrari increased their lead over McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to 13 points. Williams increased its gap over Benetton in fourth place by 16 points, while BAR passed Jordan for fifth place with 18 points with one race of the season remaining.

<text>The 2000 Malaysian Grand Prix (formally the II Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 22 October 2000, at Sepang International Circuit in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. It was the 17th and final race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, and the second Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 56-lap race from pole position. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard finished second, with Michael Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello finishing third.

McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen, started second alongside Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen, on the other hand, was handed a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for being deemed to have jumped the start. Häkkinen was able to return to fourth, his ultimate finishing position. Coulthard, who started third, took the lead until the first round of pit stops. During their second stops, Michael Schumacher and teammate Rubens Barrichello traded the lead, with the former retaining it. Michael Schumacher won the race by holding off Coulthard in the final laps.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s victory was his ninth of the season, tying his own record set in and Nigel Mansell in . Schumacher also tied Mansell&#x27;s 108-point record. McLaren was unable to pass Ferrari&#x27;s points total in the final race, confirming Ferrari as World Constructors&#x27; Champions. Coulthard&#x27;s second-place finish helped him beat Barrichello to third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Pedro Diniz&#x27;s and Johnny Herbert&#x27;s final race was at the Grand Prix; the Englishman retired after 161 race starts.

==Background==
The 2000 Malaysian Grand Prix was the 17th and final race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, held on 22 October 2000 at the clockwise Sepang International Circuit in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. It was the second Malaysian Grand Prix in the Formula One World Championship. Sole tyre supplier Bridgestone brought the Soft dry compound and the Intermediate, Heavy Wet and Soft wet-weather compounds to the race.

Before the event, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the season&#x27;s World Drivers&#x27; Championship at the preceding . Schumacher led the championship with 98 points; McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen was second on 86 points. With only 10 points available for the remaining race, Häkkinen was unable to catch Schumacher. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard was third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 67 points behind Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen, and 58 points ahead of Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello. If Barrichello won the race and Coulthard finished outside the top six, he could still finish third. Although the Drivers&#x27; Championship was decided, the World Constructors&#x27; Championship was not. Ferrari led on 156 points, and McLaren were second on 143 points, with a maximum of 16 points available. McLaren needed to finish first and second in the race to become Constructors&#x27; Champions, but Ferrari needed one of its two drivers to finish second or collect three points by finishing fourth to win the title.

Protests against Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim&#x27;s imprisonment threatened to disrupt the race. The campaign group, known as Free Anwar, were reported in the media that they would use the event to try to bid for Ibrahim&#x27;s release. However, the campaign&#x27;s director, Raja Petra Kamarudin, later announced that the event would be untouched.

The weekend was the final race for Jaguar&#x27;s Johnny Herbert and Sauber&#x27;s Pedro Diniz. Herbert&#x27;s switch to CART was publicised shortly before, and he acknowledged that he had turned down an offer to test for the Williams team. Herbert said going into the weekend: &quot;It&#x27;s going to be a bit emotional getting out of the car for the last time and out of Formula One. But I&#x27;m really looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead of me.&quot; Diniz&#x27;s future was uncertain, as he was rumoured to be moving to Prost after extensive negotiations with the team.

Following the Japanese Grand Prix on 8 October, three teams tested at European race tracks between 10 and 13 October to prepare for the upcoming race. Ferrari spent the four days with test driver Luca Badoer, who tested new mechanical components on the F1-2000 car at the Fiorano Circuit on a wet/dry track. He then moved to the Mugello Circuit where he tested brakes, car set-ups, tyre evaluation, endurance runs for the car&#x27;s engines and continued trying out new car components. Benetton cancelled a test in Barcelona ran at the Silverstone Circuit a week later using new Supertec engines angled at 110° degrees.

Eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) entered the event with each team fielding two drivers. There were few alterations to cars for the race since teams were focused on the design of their 2001 vehicles. Changes centred on the requirement to increase the cooling of each car&#x27;s mechanical components in order to cope with Malaysia&#x27;s humid climate. Several teams opened additional slots on the rear of each vehicle&#x27;s sides, while the Williams team installed chimneys used at the for the Friday free practice sessions before returning to a conventional design model the following day. Benetton fitted a new engine specification and a changed weight distribution in Alexander Wurz&#x27;s car.

==Practice==

There were two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday before Sunday&#x27;s race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions were held in hot and dry weather. Several teams reported poor radio reception, possibly caused by the large grandstands located around the track. Michael Schumacher set the first session&#x27;s fastest lap, at 1 minute and 40.290 seconds, seven-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Barrichello. Coulthard was third quickest despite spending most of the session dealing with a clutch problem. Häkkinen was fourth, ahead of Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine and BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella, Herbert, BAR&#x27;s Ricardo Zonta and Wurz (in his final race driving for Benetton) placed seventh through tenth. Some drivers went off the circuit and onto the grass during the session. 

Häkkinen set the day&#x27;s quickest time in the second practice session, a 1:40.262; Coulthard, his teammate, was third fastest. The Ferrari drivers remained fast, with Michael Schumacher second and Rubens Barrichello fourth, despite the latter developing flu symptoms. Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli was fifth quickest, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Zonta ran quicker during the session and was seventh fastest. The Benetton drivers Fisichella and Wurz, along with Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen completed the top ten. Coulthard temporarily drove onto the grass at the entry to KLIA Curve when he braked later than intended and went through the gravel to rejoin to the racing line. Mika Salo lost control of his Sauber car and went into the gravel trap at Sunway Lagoon Corner.

The weather remained hot and dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Lap times continued to fall prior to qualifying later in the day. Wurz was the fastest driver in the third practise session, lapping at 1:38.318, three thousandths of a second faster than Häkkinen in second. Coulthard set the third-fastest lap. Michael Schumacher was fourth with Barrichello sixth. Irvine was fifth. Zonta, Villeneuve, and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten. An electronic engine sensor failure at the pit lane entry on his installation lap stopped Frentzen from setting a lap. 

In the final practice session, Coulthard lapped fastest at 1:38.109 despite going into the gravel traps in the session. Michael Schumacher, Wurz, Häkkinen and Barrichello were in positions two to five. Jaguar drivers Herbert and Irvine were sixth and seventh. Jenson Button of Williams was eighth after changing his car&#x27;s engine that had a hydraulic issue. Villeneuve and Trulli were ninth and tenth. Fisichella and Minardi&#x27;s Gastón Mazzacane spun and stalled their cars after spinning. Frentzen lost control of his car, got beached in a gravel trap and stalled with five minutes left. The top 19 drivers set laps within 1.879 seconds of Wurz&#x27;s, indicating a competitive field for qualifying and race field.

==Qualifying==

Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting position determined by their fastest performance. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to achieve a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. Qualifying was held in dry and hot weather. Michael Schumacher took his ninth pole position of the season and 32nd of his career with a lap time of 1:37.397 set with three minutes remaining after a second attempt with a rear wing change was cancelled owing to a flat-spotted tyre. Häkkinen, who finished 0.463 seconds behind than Schumacher due to a car imbalance, joined him on the grid&#x27;s front row. Coulthard qualified third and during a refueling pit stop when a fire caused by a loose fuel line on his McLaren saw petrol seet into his left eye. He said that the issue could have escalated if swift action had not been taken. Barrichello, who still had the flu, qualified fourth having been demoted from second in qualifying&#x27;s closing seconds. Wurz qualified fifth, his best qualifying result of the season. Although his car&#x27;s engine was shut off due to a loss of power that caused him to slow down on the straights during his final run, Villeneuve set the sixth fastest lap time. 

Despite believing he could have been faster as he slowed through turn 15, Irvine made setup adjustments and took seventh. Ralf Schumacher in eighth lost four-tenths of a second on his fastest lap. Trulli and Frentzen were ninth and tenth for Jordan. Zonta missed qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second owing to braking issues. Herbert qualified twelfth in his final Formula One race and experienced understeer due to an engine change. He was ahead of Fisichella in 13th and Pedro de la Rosa in 14th, who set the fastest lap for the Arrows team on new tyres. Jos Verstappen, 15th, suffered from understeer, resulting in a driver error and damage to a radiator that leaked water in his race car. As a result, he drove Arrows&#x27; spare car. Button qualified 16th after experiencing traffic during qualifying and being unable to lap faster as he could not scrub down his tyres. Salo, 17th, had all four of his runs influenced by outside factors, and he lost downforce by following Irvine. Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi and Nick Heidfeld qualified 18th and 19th, respectively, due to climate-related performance issues. Diniz finished 20th due to understeer and a tyre mix-up. Minardi&#x27;s Marc Gené (21st) and Mazzacane (22nd) completed the starting order.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 10:30 Malaysian Standard Time (GMT +8) for a half hour warm-up session in warm, dry weather. Lap times in the session were about two and a half seconds slower than in qualifying because vehicles were fitted with race-specific bodywork and radiators. Zonta set the quickest lap time, a 1:40.032, with two minutes left. Both McLaren drivers finished in the top four—Häkkinen was second, slightly slower than Zonta, while Coulthard was fourth. Michael Schumacher, in third place, separated them.

==Race==

The 56-laps race that ran over started at 15:00 local time. The conditions for the race were dry and cloudy with the air temperature and the track temperature ; humidity was at 60 per cent. Tyre wear was not a major concern for the race. Cockpit temperatures were at their highest of the season due to the warm and humid climate. Häkkinen, who started alongside Michael Schumacher, jumped the start by moving early, appearing to stop before the start, and then taking the lead. Coulthard moved faster off the line, passing Michael Schumacher on the outside for second into the first corner. 

Diniz attempted to pass Heidfeld who was alongside de la Rosa at the second turn, but he overshot the entry and crashed into the rear of Alesi&#x27;s car, which was spun around and made contact with Heidfeld. Heidfeld pushed De La Rosa into the wall; De La Rosa, Diniz, and Heidfeld became the race&#x27;s first retirements, while Alesi continued. Both Minardi drivers were forced wide in avoidance. On the same lap, Ralf Schumacher (affected by a major cold) was forced onto the grass while attempting to pass Irvine, and Trulli damaged his front wing after colliding with the Jaguar. Trulli stopped for a new front wing, while Verstappen spun off. These crashes necessitated the deployment of the safety car driven by Bernd Mayländer to slow the race.

When the safety car entered the pit lane at the conclusion of the second lap, the race resumed with Häkkinen leading. Häkkinen let teammate Coulthard pass for the lead on lap three, and he was later overtaken by both Ferrari drivers after running wide at a corner on the same lap. At the competition of the third lap, Coulthard led from Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Häkkinen, Wurz, and Villeneuve. Because he was driving a lightly fuelled car, Coulthard began to pull away from Michael Schumacher almost immediately with successive fastest laps. Häkkinen received a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap four for jumping the start. Zonta moved up to eighth place after overtaking Button and Herbert. On the same lap, Button lost another position to Salo. Meanwhile, Verstappen began to make up ground, taking 16th place from Gené. 

Häkkinen took his penalty on lap five, losing around 23.8 seconds due to the pit lane entry being positioned on the outside of the last turn, requiring drivers to take a longer line than those on the track, and he re-entered the track in 19th. Frentzen went off the track and entered the pit lane for repairs on the same lap. Verstappen passed Ralf Schumacher for 14th place. Coulthard set a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:40.679 on lap seven, extending his lead over Michael Schumacher to 3.6 seconds, who was 2.6 seconds ahead of teammate Barrichello. Wurz was 4.2 seconds behind Barrichello but was steadily pulling ahead of Villeneuve in fifth. Verstappen overtook Fisichella for eleventh before Frentzen retired after a power steering failure on lap seven after one exploratory lap and later a loss of hydraulic system pressure. Trulli passed Mazzacane for 16th place on the following lap. Salo overtook Herbert for eighth position on lap nine, while Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s car began to develop mechanical issues. On the tenth lap, Coulthard ran off the track at turn six, with grass penetrating his left-hand radiator inlet and blocking the hot air release pipes. This increased the engine temperature in Coulthard&#x27;s car, and McLaren was forced to amend his race strategy when his engine overheated too much. Further down, Gené lost 13th position to Alesi, as Trulli made a pit stop for further repairs to his car. Coulthard had a 5.6-second lead over Michael Schumacher by the start of lap twelve, with Verstappen passing Button for tenth. Häkkinen moved up to 14th after passing Ralf Schumacher and Gené in the next three laps. Salo and Alesi became the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. Coulthard made an early pit stop one lap later to clear the debris from his radiator, resolving his overheating problem. He rejoined the circuit in sixth. The McLaren duo were on different strategies, with Coulthard making two pit stops and Häkkinen one. Button became the race&#x27;s next retirement when his engine failed on lap 19. Michael Schumacher continued to set successive fastest laps, building an 8.8-second lead over Rubens Barrichello by the time of first pit stop on lap 24 after becoming concerned that Coulthard was quicker than him. Barrichello led for one lap before his pit stop on the following lap returned Michael Schumacher to the lead. 

By the end of lap 26, all of the leading drivers on two-stop strategies had made their pit stops. Michael Schumacher led from Coulthard, Barrichello, Herbert, Verstappen, and Villeneuve. Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28, however he went off the track and let Villeneuve back past. Herbert made his only pit stop on the same lap, stalled, and rejoined the circuit in twelfth. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve attempted to reclaim fourth from Häkkinen at turn 15 on the 30th lap, but he braked later than expected. Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher when he completed his second pit stop at the conclusion of lap 38. He returned to driving on a set of scrubbed front tyres. Gené stopped next to the pit lane barrier on the same lap and retired due to a left-rear wheel failure. 

Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on the following lap and retained the lead. Barrichello took the lead for one lap and made his pit stop on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to retake the lead. Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher who was nursing his tyres by the start of lap 45. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s team called him into the garage to retire to prevent a failure of a malfunctioning engine oil supply system that was detected by the electronic data transmitter and transmitted to Williams&#x27; command centre that lap. Zonta retired a gravel trap with a blown engine that gradually became hotter two laps later. On the 50th lap, Herbert&#x27;s car suffered a broken right driveshaft that caused a rear suspension failure under braking for the fourth corner, causing him to lose both rear wheels. He went through the gravel trap and into the turn four tyre barrier. Herbert exited his car unaided, and track marshals assisted him on a stretcher for transport to the circuit&#x27;s medical centre for precautionary x-rays. Mazzacane was the race&#x27;s and season&#x27;s final retirement with an engine piston failure on lap 54. 

Michael Schumacher held off Coulthard and crossed the finish line first on lap 56 to claim his ninth victory of the season and 44th of his career in a time of 1&#x27;35:54.235, at an average speed of . He equalled the wins record set by himself in and Nigel Mansell in . Coulthard finished second in his McLaren, 0.7 seconds behind Michael Schumacher, with Barrichello third in the other Ferrari and Häkkinen fourth. Villeneuve in fifth achieved his third consecutive points-scoring finish and Irvine who was 1.8 seconds behind completed the points-scorers in sixth. Ferrari&#x27;s race results earned the team the 2000 World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Wurz, Salo, Fisichella, Verstappen and Alesi, Trulli (who had a slow puncture) and Mazzacane were the final classified finishers.

===Post-race===

The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher said that he and his team were delighted to win the race and the Constructors&#x27; Championship. He also added that he win with the use of team strategy after he realised Coulthard was quicker than him. Coulthard apologised to Michael Schumacher for his comments about him throughout the season. He also stated that he would not be retracting any comments made concerning Schumacher&#x27;s driving technique, but rather the manner in which they were expressed. Barrichello called his race &quot;lonely&quot; because to the lack of on-track action. He also stated that the hot temperatures he dealt with were emotionally taxing owing to his illness.

McLaren team principal Ron Dennis congratulated Ferrari and Michael Schumacher for winning both the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships. Michael Schumacher expressed hope that his success in 2000 would usher in a new era of success for Ferrari. Similarly, their technical director, Ross Brawn, believe that the team may improve more in the coming seasons: &quot;We&#x27;ve got to build from this success and I&#x27;m sure we will do and get all the support from Italy and Ferrari that we will need to continue in this vein.&quot; Ferrari celebrated their win and thanked their followers for their continuing support at an event at the Mugello Circuit in front of 50,000 people. 

Häkkinen believed that if he had not received his stop-and-go penalty, he would have won the race. He added that his car was still before the starting procedure began, and that it moved before the sequence was completed. Mercedes-Benz Motorsport head Norbert Haug praised McLaren for their form and work during the season and reflected on the race, &quot;We had the speed again today, but Mika was penalised and got a stop and go. He was on the right strategy, but if you are in the pits for 10 seconds, you are not going to win. He still came in fourth and that is a great achievement. David also put a lot of pressure on Michael, until the final lap and that is a great performance.&quot; 

Villeneuve was pleased with his fifth-place performance given how his vehicle performed at the start of the season, commenting, &quot;We have made good progress and improved the car throughout the season. We have got to know the car better in terms of set-up, which has allowed us to push harder in races and challenge consistently for points.&quot; Irvine stated that he was glad to complete the year with a single championship point and that the result highlighted the car&#x27;s potential, adding, &quot;There is obviously a lot of work to do over the winter, and if that goes well, I think we can start next season in a much better position.&quot; 

Herbert was not injured in the crash, except for a bruised left knee. He expressed disappointment in his late exit in his final Formula One race, saying that &quot;I&#x27;m pretty disappointed to have a good race ruined by a failure such as that.&quot; He remarked, &quot;I guess it was inevitable that, because I began my career being carried to the car, I would end it being carried out of it. There is nothing like ending your career with a bang!&quot; Herbert left Formula One after 12 years with 161 race starts and 3 race victories. Jaguar technical director Gary Anderson traced the suspension failure to a broken link on the rear right suspension rod. Herbert continued to participate in motor racing in 2001 driving in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the American Le Mans Series. He later abandoned plans to drive in CART and became a test driver for the Arrows team in February 2001. Diniz, meanwhile, could not find a race seat and became a shareholder in the Prost team, helping the team become more competitive.
