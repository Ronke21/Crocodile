<doc id="1118819" wikidata="Q6619448" url="?curid=1118819" title="List of feminist poets">
<text>This is a list of feminist poets. Historically, literature has been a male-dominated sphere, and any poetry written by a woman could be seen as feminist. Often, feminist poetry refers to that which was composed after the 1960s and the second wave of the feminist movement. This list focuses on poets who take explicitly feminist approaches to their poetry.

<text>A palfrey is a type of horse that was highly valued as a riding horse in the Middle Ages. It was a lighter-weight horse, usually a smooth gaited one that could amble, suitable for riding over long distances. Palfreys were not a specific breed as horse breeds are understood today.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;palfrey&quot; is cognate with of any type); both words descend from , itself deriving from Gaulish .

Meanwhile, the German term for a palfrey is (), cognate with Icelandic .

== Breeding ==

A palfrey usually was the most expensive and highly bred type of riding horse during the Middle Ages, sometimes equalling the knight&#x27;s destrier in price. Consequently, it was popular with nobles, ladies, and highly ranked knights for riding, hunting, and ceremonial use. Knights would ride palfreys to battle so that their heavier warhorses wouldn&#x27;t be fatigued during combat.

== Gait ==

The significant characteristic of the palfrey was that, rather than trotting, it usually possessed a smooth, ambling gait. The amble was the name given to a group of smooth, four-beat gaits faster than a walk, but slower than a canter or gallop. The trot is a two-beat gait, about 8 mph, suitable for covering a lot of ground relatively quickly. However, the horse also has a bit of a spring in its motion as it switches diagonal pairs of legs with each beat, and thus can be rough for a rider, and the trot also jostles about packs or weaponry to a considerable degree. The amble is about as fast as the trot, not tiring for a horse that performs it naturally, and much smoother for the rider. Thus, because much ground transportation in the Middle Ages was on horseback, with long distances to be covered, a smooth-gaited horse was much desired.

An amble is achieved by the horse when it moves with a four-step rhythm, either derived from the two-beat lateral gait known as the pace or from the diagonal trot, with the two beats broken up so there are four. There are several variations, but most either have a lateral sequence of footfalls (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), or a diagonal sequence (left hind, right front, right hind, left front). In either case, only one foot is all the way off the ground at a time. Such a gait can be maintained for long distances, and sometimes at considerable speed. Modern genetic studies have verified that ambling ability is linked to a specific genetic mechanism.
Ambling horses are now uncommon in Europe. They were effectively replaced by trotting horses for several reasons: The first was that as roads improved, travel by carriage became more common, and trotting horse breeds were generally larger and stronger, more suited to the job at hand. Another reason was the rise of the Thoroughbred and other breeds developed for horse racing and for light cavalry, both of which required horses able to gallop for substantial periods of time. Breeds swift at the gallop also tend to trot rather than pace or amble. In the Americas, ambling horses continued to be bred, both in the southern United States and in Latin America.

The smooth ambling gaits today have many names, including the single-foot, the stepping pace, the tolt, the rack, the paso corto, and the fox trot (see &quot;ambling&quot;). There are still many ambling breeds, particularly in North America where today they are referred to as gaited horses. Some of these breeds include the Missouri Fox Trotter, Tennessee Walking Horse, Icelandic horse and a sub-group within the American Saddlebred. The Paso Fino and the Peruvian Paso, breeds developed in Latin America, perform two or three different ambling gaits of varying speed, and are probably the closest modern descendants of the medieval palfrey.

<text>Parenthood is a 1989 American family comedy-drama film with an ensemble cast that includes Steve Martin, Tom Hulce, Rick Moranis, Martha Plimpton, Keanu Reeves, Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen, and Dianne Wiest.

The film was directed by Ron Howard, who assisted in developing the story with screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. Much of it is based on the family and parenting experiences of Howard, Ganz, Mandel, and producer Brian Grazer, who have at least 17 children among the four of them. Principal photography was filmed in and around Orlando, Florida with some scenes filmed at the University of Florida. It was nominated for two Academy Awards: Dianne Wiest for Best Supporting Actress and Randy Newman for Best Song for &quot;I Love to See You Smile&quot;.

The film was adapted into NBC television series in 1990 and 2010. While the first series was canceled after one season, the second series ran for six seasons.

==Plot==
The plot centers on the four Buckman siblings: Gil, Helen, Larry, and Susan 

Gil Buckman, a St. Louis sales executive, is trying to balance his family and his career. When he finds out that his eldest son, Kevin, has emotional problems and needs psychological counseling and that his two younger children, Taylor and Justin, both have issues as well, he begins to blame himself and questions his abilities as a father. When his wife, Karen, becomes pregnant with their fourth child, he is unsure whether he can handle it.

Gil is also frustrated and fearful that the financial burdens of another child and office politics at work are turning him into the detached workaholic he despised in his own father, Frank. Humbled by family and work issues, Gil opens up to Frank about his doubts as a parent. Frank tells him that he worries too much, and they have a reconciliation of sorts with Frank telling Gil that worry for one&#x27;s children never ends. Gil is finally able to accept the life he has chosen after his elderly grandmother tells him the story of her first experience riding a roller coaster when she was young; she was amazed at all of the different emotions she experienced compared to the merry-go-round, which was simple and bland.

Gil&#x27;s sister Helen is a divorced bank manager and mother of two, Julie and Garry. Her wealthy dentist ex-husband wants nothing to do with their kids beyond his small child support payments, preferring to spend more time with his new family. Garry, who has just entered puberty, is quiet and withdrawn and likes to be alone in his room with a mysterious paper bag. At first, Helen worries that it contains drugs or alcohol, but later discovers that it actually contains pornography.

Julie is still in high school but is not interested in her education. She and her boyfriend, Tod Higgins, get married, she becomes pregnant, and Tod moves into Helen&#x27;s house. Helen asks Tod to talk with Garry believing he would be more comfortable confiding to another male. Tod reassures Garry that his obsession with girls and sex is normal for a boy his age, to Garry&#x27;s relief. This also increases Helen&#x27;s respect for Tod, especially when Tod reveals his own past involving his abusive father and his determination not to follow the same path. Eventually, she supports Tod and Julie&#x27;s relationship to the extent that when Julie wants to break up with Tod, Helen orders her to face her fears and work on their relationship. Helen also starts dating Garry&#x27;s science teacher, George Bowman---giving Garry a father figure.

Susan, Gil and Helen&#x27;s youngest sister, is a middle school teacher married to scientist and researcher Nathan Huffner. They have a precocious daughter, Patty. Susan wants more children, but Nathan is more interested in Patty&#x27;s cognitive development. Susan lashes out by eating junk food and compromises her diaphragm as a plan to get pregnant against Nathan&#x27;s wishes. She eventually gets so frustrated that she leaves Nathan. To win Susan back, he comes to one of her classes and serenades her. Nathan promises that he will try to change and she agrees to move back home.

Third-born Larry is the black sheep of the family, but also Frank&#x27;s favorite. Rather than settle into a career, he has drifted through life trying to cash in on get-rich-quick schemes. Larry has recently shown up along with his biracial son, Cool (the result of a brief affair with a Las Vegas showgirl), asking to borrow money from Frank. It soon becomes apparent that he needs it to pay off gambling debts or he will be killed. Though Frank is disillusioned by his son, he still loves him and tries to help. Frank refuses to bail him out completely but offers to teach him the family business so he can take over for Frank (who has to put off retirement to pay off the debt). However, with the apparent mindset that Cool would be better off without him, Larry instead suggests another get-rich-quick scheme which involves him going to Chile. Frank agrees to look after Cool, knowing that Larry will most likely never return.

Some time later, the family reunites at the hospital when Helen gives birth to a baby girl. Frank holds Cool who is shown to be thriving. Tod and Julie are together, raising their son. Susan is visibly pregnant. Gil and Karen are now the parents of four.

<doc id="1118832" wikidata="Q4784715" url="?curid=1118832" title="Arbitrarily large">
<text>In mathematics, the phrases arbitrarily large, arbitrarily small and arbitrarily long are used in statements to make clear the fact that an object is large, small, or long with little limitation or restraint, respectively. The use of &quot;arbitrarily&quot; often occurs in the context of real numbers (and its subsets thereof), though its meaning can differ from that of &quot;sufficiently&quot; and &quot;infinitely&quot;.

== Examples ==
The statement

: &quot;formula_1 is non-negative for arbitrarily large &quot;formula_2&quot;.&quot;

is a shorthand for:

: &quot;For every real number &quot;formula_3&quot;, formula_1 is non-negative for some value of &quot;formula_2&quot; greater than &quot;formula_3&quot;.&quot;

In the common parlance, the term &quot;arbitrarily long&quot; is often used in the context of sequence of numbers. For example, to say that there are &quot;arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers&quot; does not mean that there exists any infinitely long arithmetic progression of prime numbers (there is not), nor that there exists any particular arithmetic progression of prime numbers that is in some sense &quot;arbitrarily long&quot;. Rather, the phrase is used to refer to the fact that no matter how large a number &quot;formula_3&quot; is, there exists some arithmetic progression of prime numbers of length at least &quot;formula_3&quot;.

Similar to arbitrarily large, one can also define the phrase &quot;formula_9 holds for arbitrarily small real numbers&quot;, as follows:

:formula_10

In other words:

: However small a number, there will be a number &quot;formula_2&quot; smaller than it such that formula_9 holds.

== Arbitrarily large vs. sufficiently large vs. infinitely large ==
While similar, &quot;arbitrarily large&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;sufficiently large&quot;. For instance, while it is true that prime numbers can be arbitrarily large (since there are infinitely many of them due to Euclid&#x27;s theorem), it is not true that all sufficiently large numbers are prime. 

As another example, the statement &quot;formula_1 is non-negative for arbitrarily large &quot;formula_2&quot;.&quot; could be rewritten as:

:formula_15

However, using &quot;sufficiently large&quot;, the same phrase becomes:

:formula_16

Furthermore, &quot;arbitrarily large&quot; also does not mean &quot;infinitely large&quot;. For example, although prime numbers can be arbitrarily large, an infinitely large prime number does not exist—since all prime numbers (as well as all other integers) are finite.

In some cases, phrases such as &quot;the proposition formula_9 is true for arbitrarily large &quot;formula_2&quot;&quot; are used primarily for emphasis, as in &quot;formula_9 is true for all &quot;formula_2&quot;, no matter how large &quot;formula_2&quot; is.&quot; In these cases, the phrase &quot;arbitrarily large&quot; does not have the meaning indicated above (i.e., &quot;however large a number, there will be &quot;some&quot; larger number for which formula_9 still holds.&quot;). Instead, the usage in this case is in fact logically synonymous with &quot;all&quot;.

<text>Soil classification deals with the systematic categorization of soils based on distinguishing characteristics as well as criteria that dictate choices in use.

== Overview ==
Soil classification is a dynamic subject, from the structure of the system, to the definitions of classes, to the application in the field. Soil classification can be approached from the perspective of soil as a material and soil as a resource.

Inscriptions at the temple of Horus at Edfu outline a soil classification used by Tanen to determine what kind of temple to build at which site. Ancient Greek scholars produced a number of classification based on several different qualities of the soil.

=== Engineering ===
Geotechnical engineers classify soils according to their engineering properties as they relate to use for foundation support or building material. Modern engineering classification systems are designed to allow an easy transition from field observations to basic predictions of soil engineering properties and behaviors. 

The most common engineering classification system for soils in North America is the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The USCS has three major classification groups: (1) coarse-grained soils (e.g. sands and gravels); (2) fine-grained soils (e.g. silts and clays); and (3) highly organic soils (referred to as &quot;peat&quot;). The USCS further subdivides the three major soil classes for clarification. It distinguishes sands from gravels by grain size, classifying some as &quot;well-graded&quot; and the rest as &quot;poorly-graded&quot;. Silts and clays are distinguished by the soils&#x27; Atterberg limits, and thus the soils are separated into &quot;high-plasticity&quot; and &quot;low-plasticity&quot; soils. Moderately organic soils are considered subdivisions of silts and clays and are distinguished from inorganic soils by changes in their plasticity properties (and Atterberg limits) on drying. The European soil classification system (ISO 14688) is very similar, differing primarily in coding and in adding an &quot;intermediate-plasticity&quot; classification for silts and clays, and in minor details.

Other engineering soil classification systems in the United States include the AASHTO Soil Classification System, which classifies soils and aggregates relative to their suitability for pavement construction, and the Modified Burmister system, which works similarly to the USCS but includes more coding for various soil properties.

A full geotechnical engineering soil description will also include other properties of the soil including color, in-situ moisture content, in-situ strength, and somewhat more detail about the material properties of the soil than is provided by the USCS code. The USCS and additional engineering description is standardized in ASTM D 2487.

=== Soil science ===


For soil resources, experience has shown that a natural system approach to classification, i.e. grouping soils by their intrinsic property (soil morphology), behaviour, or genesis, results in classes that can be interpreted for many diverse uses. Differing concepts of pedogenesis, and differences in the significance of morphological features to various land uses can affect the classification approach. Despite these differences, in a well-constructed system, classification criteria group similar concepts so that interpretations do not vary widely. This is in contrast to a technical system approach to soil classification, where soils are grouped according to their fitness for a specific use and their edaphic characteristics.

Natural system approaches to soil classification, such as the French Soil Reference System (Référentiel pédologique français) are based on presumed soil genesis. Systems have developed, such as USDA soil taxonomy and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, which use taxonomic criteria involving soil morphology and laboratory tests to inform and refine hierarchical classes. Another approach is numerical classification, also called ordination, where soil individuals are grouped by multivariate statistical methods such as cluster analysis. This produces natural groupings without requiring any inference about soil genesis.

In soil survey, as practiced in the United States, soil classification usually means criteria based on soil morphology in addition to characteristics developed during soil formation. Criteria are designed to guide choices in land use and soil management. As indicated, this is a hierarchical system that is a hybrid of both natural and objective criteria. USDA soil taxonomy provides the core criteria for differentiating soil map units. This is a substantial revision of the 1938 USDA soil taxonomy which was a strictly natural system. The USDA classification was originally developed by Guy Donald Smith, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s soil survey investigations. Soil taxonomy based soil map units are additionally sorted into classes based on technical classification systems. Land Capability Classes, hydric soil, and prime farmland are some examples. 

The European Union uses the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), currently the fourth edition is valid. According to the first edition of the WRB (1998), the booklet &quot;Soils of the European Union&quot; was published by the former Institute of Environment and Sustainability (now: Land Resources Unit, European Soil Data Centre/ESDAC).

In addition to scientific soil classification systems, there are also vernacular soil classification systems. Folk taxonomies have been used for millennia, while scientifically based systems are relatively recent developments. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of soils has increased dramatically. SoilGrids is a system for automated soil mapping based on models fitted using soil profiles and environmental covariate data. On a global scale, it provides maps at 1.00–0.25 km spatial resolution. Whether sustainability might be the ultimate goal for managing the global soil resources, these new developments require studied soils to be classified and given its own name.

===OSHA===
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires the classification of soils to protect workers from injury when working in excavations and trenches. OSHA uses three soil classifications plus one for rock, based primarily on strength but also other factors which affect the stability of cut slopes:

* : natural solid mineral matter that can be excavated with vertical sides and remain intact while exposed.
* - cohesive, plastic soils with unconfined compressive strength greater than 1.5 ton per square foot (tsf)(144 kPa), and meeting several other requirements (which induces a lateral earth pressure of 25 psf per ft of depth)
* - cohesive soils with unconfined compressive strength between 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) and 1.5 tsf (144 kPa), or unstable dry rock, or soils which would otherwise be Type A (lateral earth pressure of 45 psf per ft of depth)
* - granular soils or cohesive soils with unconfined compressive strength less than 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) or any submerged or freely seeping soil or adversely bedded soils (lateral earth pressure of 80 psf per ft of depth)
* - A subtype of Type C soil, though is not officially recognized by OSHA as a separate type, induces a lateral earth pressure of 60 psf per ft of depth

Each of the soil classifications has implications for the way the excavation must be made or the protections (sloping, shoring, shielding, etc.) that must be provided to protect workers from collapse of the excavated bank.

=== Current technical systems ===
Technical soil classification systems focus on representing some specific facet or quality of the soil, rather than a direct pedogenetic classification. Such technical classifications are developed with specific applications in mind, such as soil-water relationships, land quality assessment or geotechnical engineering.

<text>Frederic Herbert Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham, (20 October 1866 – 23 March 1958) was a British barrister and judge who was Lord Chancellor from March 1938 until September 1939.

==Background and education==
Born in Paris, Maugham was the second son of Robert Ormond Maugham, a solicitor, by his wife, Edith, daughter of Major Charles Snell. The author W. Somerset Maugham was his younger brother. His grandfather, Robert Maugham, was one of the founders of the Law Society. He was educated at Dover College and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He rowed for the winning Cambridge crew in the 1888 Boat Race and was also in the winning Trinity Hall Boat Club coxless four which won the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta that year. He was in the winning Cambridge crew in the Boat Race again in 1889. He also became President of the Cambridge Union Society in Lent Term 1889.

==Political and legal career==

Maugham was called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1890, and embarked upon a legal career, becoming a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1913. In 1922, he briefly considered entering politics as a Conservative Member of Parliament but could not find a seat. He was a Judge of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) from 1928 to 1934 and a Lord Justice of Appeal from 1934 to 1935. He was knighted in 1928 and sworn of the Privy Council in 1934. The following year he became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, was created a life peer on 7 October 1935 and entered the House of Lords as Baron Maugham, &quot;of Hartfield in the County of Sussex&quot;. Three years later he was offered the position of Lord Chancellor by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Such was Maugham&#x27;s lack of political experience that Chamberlain and he had never met before. He was offered the role because there were very few obvious available choices amongst the ranks of parliamentary supporters of the National Government to replace the ailing Lord Hailsham—for the obvious successor, Sir Thomas Inskip, could not be moved from the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence.

As Maugham was already 71 years old it was widely expected that he would prove to be a mere stop-gap appointment, to be succeeded by Inskip as soon as it was possible for the latter to leave Defence. However, by the time this occurred in early 1939, Chamberlain was sufficiently impressed with Maugham&#x27;s work to offer to retain him, whilst allowing Inskip the opportunity to defer choosing between becoming Lord Chancellor or remaining in the House of Commons with the possibility of becoming prime minister, a choice that Hailsham had always regretted. Chamberlain intended to make a change at the next general election, which was expected to take place that year.

However, war intervened and Chamberlain carried out a full-scale reconstruction of his government. As part of this Maugham was allowed to retire, to be finally succeeded by Inskip, who was ennobled as Viscount Caldecote. Maugham took the retirement honour, of being created Viscount Maugham, &quot;of Hartfield in the County of Sussex&quot; on 22 September 1939, which, unlike his barony, was hereditary. He again served as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary until 1941.

==Family==
Maugham married Helen Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Romer, in 1896.

They had four children:

*The Hon. Kate Mary Maugham (1897–1961, married Robert Charles Bruce)
*The Hon. Edith Honor Maugham (1901–1996, married Sebastian Earl)
*The Hon. Diana Julia Maugham (1908–2007, married Kenneth Marr-Johnson)
*Robert Cecil Romer Maugham (1916–1981), 2nd Viscount. Known as Robin Maugham. He wrote about his father in two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Escape from the Shadows&quot; (1970) and &quot;Search for Nirvana&quot; (1977).

Lady Maugham died in October 1950, aged 78. Lord Maugham survived her by seven years, dying in March 1958, aged 91. He is buried in the grounds of the parish church in Hartfield, East Sussex, alongside his wife and son.

<text>In organic chemistry, a carbene is a molecule containing a neutral carbon atom with a valence of two and two unshared valence electrons. The general formula is or where the R represents substituents or hydrogen atoms.

The term &quot;carbene&quot; may also refer to the specific compound , also called methylene, the parent hydride from which all other carbene compounds are formally derived. 

There are two types of carbenes: singlets or triplets, depending upon their electronic structure. The different classes undergo different reactions. 

Most carbenes are extremely reactive and short-lived. A small number (the dihalocarbenes, carbon monoxide, and carbon monosulfide) can be isolated, and can stabilize as metal ligands, but otherwise cannot be stored in bulk. A rare exception are the persistent carbenes, which have extensive application in modern organometallic chemistry. 

==Generation==
There are two common methods for carbene generation: α-elimination and small-molecule extrusion. 

===Α-Elimination===
In α elimination, two substituents eliminate from the same carbon atom. Α-elimination typically occurs when strong bases act on acidic protons with no good vicinal leaving groups. For example, phenyllithium will abstract HX from a haloform (CHX3). Such reactions often require phase-transfer conditions. 

Molecules with no acidic proton can still be induced to α-eliminate. A geminal dihalide exposed to organolithiums can undergo metal-halogen exchange and then eliminate a lithium salt: 
:R2CBr2 + BuLi → R2CLi(Br) + BuBr
:R2CLi(Br) → R2C + LiBr
Zinc metal abstracts halogens similarly in the Simmons–Smith reaction. 

Mercuric and organomercury halides (except fluorides) can stably store a wide variety carbenes as the α-halomercury adduct until a mild thermolysis. For example, the &quot;Seyferth reagent&quot; releases CCl2 upon heating:
:C6H5HgCCl3 → CCl2 + C6H5HgCl

It remains uncertain which (if any) of such metallated reagents form truly free carbenes, instead of a reactive metal-carbene complex. Nevertheless, reactions with such metallocarbenes generally give the same organic products as with other carbene sources.

===Small-molecule extrusion===
Separately, carbenes can be produced from an extrusion reaction with a large free energy change. Diazirines and epoxides photolyze with a tremendous release in ring strain to carbenes, the former to inert nitrogen gas. Epoxides typically give reactive carbonyl wastes, and asymmetric epoxides can potentially form two different carbenes. Typically, the C-O bond with lesser fractional bond order (fewer double-bond resonance structures) breaks. For example, when one substituent is alkyl and another aryl, the aryl-substituted carbon is usually released as a carbene fragment. 

Ring strain is not necessary for a strong thermodynamic driving force. Photolysis, heat, or transition metal catalysts (typically rhodium and copper) decompose diazoalkanes to a carbene and gaseous nitrogen; such are the Bamford–Stevens reaction and Wolff rearrangement. As with metallocarbenes, some reactions of diazoalkanes that formally proceed via carbenes may instead form a [3+2] cycloadduct intermediate that extrudes nitrogen. 

To generate an alkylidene carbene a ketone can be exposed to trimethylsilyldiazomethane and then a strong base: 

==Structures and bonding==

The two classes of carbenes are singlet and triplet carbenes. Triplet carbenes are diradicals with two unpaired electrons, typically form from reactions that break two σ bonds (α elimination and some extrusion reactions), and do not rehybridize the carbene atom. Singlet carbenes have a single lone pair, typically form from diazo decompositions, and adopt an &quot;sp&quot;2 orbital structure. Bond angles (as determined by EPR) are 125–140° for triplet methylene and 102° for singlet methylene.

Most carbenes have a nonlinear triplet ground state. For simple hydrocarbons, triplet carbenes are usually only 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) more stable than singlet carbenes, comparable to nitrogen inversion. The stabilization is in part attributed to Hund&#x27;s rule of maximum multiplicity. However, strategies to stabilize triplet carbenes at room temperature are elusive. 9-Fluorenylidene has been shown to be a rapidly equilibrating mixture of singlet and triplet states with an approximately 1.1 kcal/mol (4.6 kJ/mol) energy difference, although extensive electron delocalization into the rings complicates any conclusions drawn from diaryl carbenes. Simulations suggest that electropositive heteroatoms can thermodynamically stabilize triplet carbenes, such as in silyl and silyloxy carbenes, especially carbenes.

Lewis-basic nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, or halide substituents bonded to the divalent carbon can delocalize an electron pair into an empty &quot;p&quot; orbital to stabilize the singlet state. This phenomenon underlies persistent carbenes&#x27; remarkable stability. 

==Reactivity==
Carbenes behave like very aggressive Lewis acids. They can attack lone pairs, but their primary synthetic utility arises from attacks on π bonds, which give cyclopropanes; and on σ bonds, which cause carbene insertion. Other reactions include rearrangements and dimerizations. A particular carbene&#x27;s reactivity depends on the substituents, including any metals present. 

=== Singlet-triplet effects ===

Singlet and triplet carbenes exhibit divergent reactivity. 

Triplet carbenes are diradicals, and participate in stepwise radical additions. Triplet carbene addition necessarily involves (at least one) intermediate with two unpaired electrons. 

Singlet carbenes can (and do) react as electrophiles, nucleophiles, or ambiphiles. Their reactions are typically concerted and often cheletropic. Singlet carbenes are typically electrophilic, unless they have a filled &quot;p&quot; orbital, in which case they can react as Lewis bases. The Bamford–Stevens reaction gives carbenes in aprotic solvents and carbenium ions in protic ones.

The different mechanisms imply that singlet carbene additions are stereospecific but triplet carbene additions stereoselective. Methylene from diazomethane photolysis reacts with either &quot;cis&quot;- or &quot;trans&quot;-2-butene to give a single diastereomer of 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane: &quot;cis&quot; from &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; from &quot;trans&quot;. Thus methylene is a singlet carbene; if it were triplet, the product would not depend on the starting alkene geometry.

===Cyclopropanation===
Carbenes add to double bonds to form cyclopropanes, and, in the presence of a copper catalyst, to alkynes to give cyclopropenes. Addition reactions are commonly very fast and exothermic, and carbene generation limits reaction rate. 

In Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation, the iodomethylzinc iodide typically complexes to any allylic hydroxy groups such that addition is &quot;syn&quot; to the hydroxy group.

===C—H insertion===
Insertions are another common type of carbene reaction, a form of oxidative addition. Insertions may or may not occur in single step (see above). The end result is that the carbene interposes itself into an existing bond, preferably X–H (X not carbon), else C–H or (failing that) a C–C bond. Alkyl carbenes insert much more selectively than methylene, which does not differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary C-H bonds. 

The 1,2-rearrangement produced from intramolecular insertion into a bond adjacent to the carbene center is a nuisance in some reaction schemes, as it consumes the carbene to yield the same effect as a traditional elimination reaction. Generally, rigid structures favor intramolecular insertions. In flexible structures, five-membered ring formation is preferred to six-membered ring formation. When such insertions are possible, no intermolecular insertions are seen. Both inter- and intra-molecular insertions admit asymmetric induction from a chiral metal catalyst.

=== Electrophilic attack ===
Carbenes can form adducts with nucleophiles, and are a common precursor to various 1,3-dipoles. 

===Carbene dimerization===
Carbenes and carbenoid precursors can dimerize to alkenes. This is often, but not always, an unwanted side reaction; metal carbene dimerization has been used in the synthesis of polyalkynylethenes and is the major industrial route to Teflon (see ). Persistent carbenes equilibrate with their respective dimers, the Wanzlick equilibrium.

==Ligands in organometallic chemistry==
In organometallic species, metal complexes with the formulae LnMCRR&#x27; are often described as carbene complexes. Such species do not however react like free carbenes and are rarely generated from carbene precursors, except for the persistent carbenes. The transition metal carbene complexes can be classified according to their reactivity, with the first two classes being the most clearly defined:
*Fischer carbenes, in which the carbene is bonded to a metal that bears an electron-withdrawing group (usually a carbonyl). In such cases the carbenoid carbon is mildly electrophilic.
*Schrock carbenes, in which the carbene is bonded to a metal that bears an electron-donating group. In such cases the carbenoid carbon is nucleophilic and resembles a Wittig reagent (which are not considered carbene derivatives).
*Carbene radicals, in which the carbene is bonded to an open-shell metal with the carbene carbon possessing a radical character. Carbene radicals have features of both Fischer and Schrock carbenes, but are typically long-lived reaction intermediates.
*N-Heterocyclic (NHC), Arduengo or Wanzlick carbenes are C-deprotonated imidazolium or dihydroimidazolium salts. They often are deployed as ancillary ligands in organometallic chemistry. Such carbenes are usually very strong σ-donor spectator ligands, similar to phosphines. 

==Industrial applications==
A large-scale application of carbenes is the industrial production of tetrafluoroethylene, the precursor to Teflon. Tetrafluoroethylene is generated via the intermediacy of difluorocarbene:
: CHClF2 → CF2 + HCl
:2 CF2 → F2C=CF2

The insertion of carbenes into C–H bonds has been exploited widely, e.g. the functionalization of polymeric materials and electro-curing of adhesives. Many applications rely on synthetic 3-aryl-3-trifluoromethyldiazirines (a carbene precursor that can be activated by heat, light, or voltage) but there is a whole family of carbene dyes. 

==History==
Carbenes had first been postulated by Eduard Buchner in 1903 in cyclopropanation studies of ethyl diazoacetate with toluene. In 1912 Hermann Staudinger also converted alkenes to cyclopropanes with diazomethane and CH2 as an intermediate. Doering in 1954 demonstrated their synthetic utility with dichlorocarbene.

<doc id="1118863" wikidata="Q7897461" url="?curid=1118863" title="Unshackled!">
<text>Unshackled! is a radio drama series produced by Pacific Garden Mission, in Chicago, Illinois, that first aired on September 23, 1950. It is one of the longest-running radio dramas in history and one of a very few still in production in the United States. The show is aired over 6,500 times around the world each week on over 1,550 radio outlets, and is translated and re-dramatized into eight languages on six continents. 

As of January 2022, over 3,707 episodes have been produced, each 30 minutes in length. &quot;Unshackled!&quot; is produced in the same way as shows during the Golden Age of Radio: Actors record dialogue live before a studio audience, an organist plays live incidental music, and a sound-effects person plays sounds in real time as the show progresses. The show has retained a consistent and distinctive quality throughout its years of production, established by Jack Odell&#x27;s 40-year tenure as its producer/director from 1950 to 1990.

==Characters and stories==
Each production dramatizes the testimony of someone who converts to Evangelical Christianity, sometimes, the person converts either during or after a visit to Pacific Garden Mission or the person converts after hearing &quot;Unshackled!&quot; on the radio. Episodes include the life stories of baseball-great-turned-evangelist Billy Sunday, himself a Pacific Garden Mission convert, and Dominic Mance, an international banker who became a homeless vagabond nearly overnight. Past members of the cast and crew range from current actors to Golden Age of Radio personalities such as Harry Elders, Bob O&#x27;Donnell, Jack Bivans, Stan Dale and Russ Reed. 

With rare exceptions, the scripts are derived from actual testimonies and actual events. Beginning in the 1950s, comic book versions of many &quot;Unshackled!&quot; stories were also produced.

<text>Michael Crawford Kerr (March 15, 1827 – August 19, 1876) was an American lawyer and legislator who served as the first Democratic speaker of the United States House of Representatives after the Civil War.

==Early life==
He was born at Titusville, Pennsylvania and educated at the Erie Academy. He graduated from the University of Louisville School of Law in 1851. He moved to New Albany, Indiana in 1852 and was a member of the State Legislature from 1856 to 1857.

==Political career==
He was elected to Congress in 1864 as a War Democrat, having vigorously opposed the Copperhead element in his district. He won the praise of Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton for helping suppress illegal conspiracies by Copperheads.

Kerr served in the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat from Indiana from 1865 to 1873. In Congress he was looked upon as one of the leaders of the Democratic Party. He strongly opposed the Republican policy of Reconstruction in the Southern States. He was not re-elected in 1872.

His hard money views on financial questions did not meet with favor in his agrarian constituency, where he openly antagonized the inflationists and the Greenback element and favored the resumption of specie payments. In 1874, however, after a sharp contest he won the seat back, and on his re-entry into Congress was elected to the speakership. He presided as Speaker at only the first session of the Forty-fourth Congress and died of consumption shortly after its adjournment.

<doc id="1118866" wikidata="Q1000808" url="?curid=1118866" title="Yasa">
<text>Yasa was a bhikkhu during the time of Gautama Buddha. He was the sixth bhikkhu in the Buddha&#x27;s sangha and was the sixth to achieve arahanthood. Yasa lived in the 6th century BCE in what is now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in northern India.

Yasa was raised in Varanasi in a life of luxury. His father was wealthy. The family home was full of servants, musicians and dancers who catered for the family&#x27;s needs and entertainment. One day, when he had become a young man, Yasa awoke early and saw his female servants and entertainers asleep in a repulsive state. Disgusted by the spectacle, Yasa realised the vanity of worldly life, and left the family home muttering “Distressed am I, oppressed am I” and journeyed in the direction of Isipatana where the Buddha was temporarily residing after his first five bhikkhus had attained arahantship. This was five days after all of the first five bhikkhus had attained arahantship.

The Buddha was pacing up and down in an open space near where Yasa was muttering “Distressed am I, oppressed am I”, and called Yasa over to him, inviting him to sit down. Yasa took off his golden sandals, saluted and sat down. The Buddha gave a dharma discourse, and Yasa achieved the first stage of arahanthood, sotapanna.

At first, the Buddha spoke about generosity (Dana), morality (sila), celestial states (sagga), the evils of sensual pleasure (kamadinava), blessing of renunciation (nekkhammanisamsa), before teaching the Four Noble Truths. 
Yasa&#x27;s mother had noticed her son&#x27;s absence, and notified her husband, who sent horsemen in four directions to search for Yasa. Yasa&#x27;s father headed in the direction of Isipatana, following the trail left by the golden slippers. When the millionaire saw the Buddha and asked him if he had seen Yasa, the Buddha asked him to sit down, and then delivered a dharma talk. After this Yasa&#x27;s father became the first to take refuge in the Triple Gems, the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Yasa, who was in the vicinity and had heard the talk given to his father, became an arahant. After father and son were reunited, the father invited the Buddha and the Sangha to his home for alms on the following day. The Buddha then ordained Yasa.

The Buddha and his six arahants visited the home of Yasa the following day. Yasa&#x27;s mother and his former wife thus became the first two female lay disciples. Upon hearing of Yasa&#x27;s ordination, four of his closest friends, Vimala, Subahu, Punnaji and Gavampati followed him into the sangha and they too became arahants. Within two months, a further fifty of Yasa&#x27;s friends had joined the Sangha and attained arahantship, bringing the total number of arahants to sixty.

The black rail was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the rails in the genus &quot;Rallus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Rallus jamaicensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Least water hen&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the English naturalist George Edwards in his &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;. Edwards had obtained a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from Jamaica by Patrick Browne. Browne had briefly mentioned the rail in his book &quot;The Civil and Natural History of Jamaica&quot;. The black rail is now placed with 12 other small rails and crakes in the genus &quot;Laterallus&quot; that was introduced in 1855 by George Robert Gray. The genus name is a portmanteau of &quot;Rallus lateralis&quot;, a synonym of the binomial name for the rufous-sided crake, the type species of the genus. The specific epithet &quot;jamaicensis&quot; is from &quot;Jamaica&quot;, the type locality.

There are five recognized subspecies:
* California rail, &quot;L. j. coturniculus&quot; – found in both fresh and salt water marshes of California and Arizona, and is a resident species. The California rail can be distinguished from other subspecies by its shorter bill, and brown crown and upper back. The California Fish and Game Commission listed  &quot;L. j. coturniculus&quot; as Threatened in 1971 due to loss of wetland habitat.   
* Eastern black rail, &quot;L. j. jamaicensis&quot; – found in eastern North America, the Caribbean, and Central America. Nicknamed the &quot;feathered mouse&quot;, the subspecies is partially migratory, with the population breeding in north-central and northeastern United States wintering further south. The US Fish and Wildlife Service declared &quot;L. j. jamaicensis&quot; a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in October 2020. The eastern black rail can be differentiated from other subspecies by its gray crown and light brown nape.
* &quot;L. j. murivagans&quot; – found in coastal Peru. This subspecies is overall paler, with white bars in the undertail coverts, distinguishing it from other subspecies. There is little information available on this subspecies.
* &quot;L. j. salinasi&quot; – found in central Chile and adjacent parts of Argentina, and is the southernmost subspecies. On average, this subspecies is larger than the other subspecies. This subspecies can be distinguished from the others by the large rufus patch on the upper back.
*Junin rail or Junin crake, &quot;L. j.tuerosi&quot; – only found in the marshes of Lake Junin, in the Andean highlands of Peru. The Junin Rail is considered Endangered because of habitat loss within its limited range. The Junín rail can be distinguished from other subspecies by its plain undertail coverts and pale legs.

Their taxonomy is in need of a review. Especially the Junin rail has a distinctive plumage and is often considered a separate species (rather than a subspecies of the black rail), but its voice, while showing some differences, generally resembles that of the two other South American subspecies, &quot;L. j. murivagans&quot; and &quot;L. j. salinasi&quot;. However, their voices are quite distinct from the voices of black rails of North America. Preliminary evidence also suggests that the Galapagos crake, another member of the black rail species complex, has a voice that resembles that of the South American black rails. Genetic data is lacking for most members of the complex, except the Galapagos crake which diverged from the North American black rail about 1.2 million years ago.

==Description==
The black rail is a small black bird with a short bill. Black rails usually weigh 29–39 g, are 10–15 cm in length, and have a wingspan of 8.7–11.0 in (22–28 cm). The body is dark, with white speckles along the back and wings. Both the beak and legs are dark. Adults have a red eye that appears around 3 months of age.

It will often make its presence known by its voice. In North America, it has a distinctive &quot;ki-ki-krr&quot; call or an aggressive, presumably territorial, growl. This is primarily uttered during the night, when these birds are most vocal. The peak of vocalization is during the first two weeks of May, when breeding and courtship behaviors are also at their peak. The South American subspecies have a quite different voice.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is found in scattered parts of North America, the Caribbean, and South America, usually in coastal salt marshes but also in some freshwater marshes. The most suitable habitat for the Black Rail are high marshes. High marsh habitats provide an ideal environment for the Black Rail, as it spends most of its time concealed within the vegetation found in this area. The bird&#x27;s unique habitat choice is primarily driven by its foraging habits. While the Black Rail stays in the drier areas of the marsh, it strategically selects locations adjacent to the low marsh regions that experience occasional inundation during spring tides. These wetter parts of the marsh serve as essential foraging grounds where the Black Rail can find mud-dwelling invertebrates. The dry areas provide safe spaces for nesting by protecting their nests from flooding during high tide. The high marsh habitat is characterized by large stretches of grasses interspersed with patches of open salt panne. The salt panne is typically dry for the majority of the year but experiences periodic flooding during extreme spring tides. In the Florida Gulf Coast marshes, one of the most common grass species in the high marsh is the marsh-hay cordgrass, which is favored by the Black Rail. It is extinct or threatened in many locations due to habitat loss. The largest populations in North America are in Florida and California.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The black rail is rarely seen and prefers running in the cover of the dense marsh vegetation to flying.

===Breeding===
This rail is territorial during the breeding season, and occasionally males will mate with two or more females. The nests of this bird are placed on the ground, in dense, swampy vegetation or in patches of flooded grass. The nests are bowl-shaped and built with vegetation loosely woven.

The clutch of this bird usually consists of six to eight creamy white speckled, with reddish-brown spots, eggs. These eggs are roundish and measure around . They are incubated by both parents, taking shifts of approximately one hour each, for 16 to 20 days. The precocial young then hatch.

In 2015, the first ever breeding by black rails in South Carolina was captured through a  camera study. This species was once thought to be a non-breeding visitor to the state.

=== Food and feeding ===
The black rail is an opportunistic feeder and consumes a wide range of food. Its diet includes seeds, insects, crustaceans and mollusks. The black rail forages by feeding along the water lines after high and low tide.

===Threats===
Under the IUCN Red List, the black rail is listed as endangered with decreasing populations. The IUCN estimates there are between 28,000 and  92,000 mature individuals remaining. The largest threats to the Black Rail are habitat destruction and severe weather events.

The wetland habitat that the black rail depends on has steadily declined through the last several decades, due to draining for development and conversion to agricultural land.  

In addition to declining populations and increasing threats, the black rail is also impacted by the lack of scientific studies available. Because of the secretive and hard to observe nature of the bird, there is very little known about them to help prevent population decline.  

They are preyed upon by many avian (hawks, egrets, and herons) and mammalian (foxes and cats) predators, and rely on the cover of thick marsh vegetation for protection. High tides are a dangerous time for black rails, as they are quite vulnerable to predation outside the marsh.

<doc id="1118877" wikidata="Q7994781" url="?curid=1118877" title="White Heat (Dusty Springfield album)">
<text>White Heat is the twelfth studio album recorded by singer Dusty Springfield, and eleventh released. It was only released in the United States and Canada.

More so than her previous two albums, &quot;It Begins Again&quot; (1978), and &quot;Living Without Your Love&quot; (1979), and the non-album single &quot;It Goes Like It Goes&quot; (1980), &quot;White Heat&quot; was a distinct departure from Springfield&#x27;s Los Angeles-produced radio-friendly soft rock sound, being closely identified with the new wave, synth-pop sounds of the early 1980s. The album arguably contains the most diverse selection of genres to be collected on any Dusty Springfield studio album, ranging from Robbie Buchanan&#x27;s ballad &quot;Time and Time Again&quot;, orchestrated by James Newton Howard, to the aggressive hard rock of &quot;Blind Sheep&quot;, co-written by Springfield herself. The sessions for &quot;Blind Sheep&quot; are the last designated sessions for Twentieth Century Fox Records in the Musician&#x27;s Guild Logs.

The album&#x27;s opening track and only single release was &quot;Donnez-Moi (Give It to Me)&quot; which production wise took more than a few hints from contemporaneous synthesizer-driven pop productions by Giorgio Moroder, like Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and Irene Cara&#x27;s &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot;, and British New Romantic bands like the Human League and their 1981 album &quot;Dare&quot;.

==Background and recording==
Jean-Alain Roussel lived in Montreal at the time. Springfield lived part-time in Toronto at this stage in her life; the two met through mutual friends and ended up collaborating on most of &quot;White Heat&quot;.

Written by Canadian New Wave band Rough Trade&#x27;s Carole Pope and Kevan Staples, &quot;Soft Core&quot; describes the realities of a dysfunctional relationship. &quot;Soft Core&quot; was cut in a single take by sheer mistake, thanks to an engineer throwing a tape machine into &#x27;record&#x27;, with composer Kevan Staples playing a grand piano. The sound of footsteps heard at the beginning of the track is, in fact, Springfield walking up to the piano for what she thought was just a rehearsal.

==Release==
In the aftermath of the disco backlash and its ensuing dramatic drop in record sales worldwide, Springfield&#x27;s American label United Artists Records was bought out. 20th Century Fox Records took on the project, but by the time that the album was completed and ready for release, 20th Century Fox had in turn been sold, bought by the US arm of the PolyGram conglomerate. The release date was postponed for another six months and when &quot;White Heat&quot; finally came out, it had been relegated to the re-activated Casablanca Records, a label closely associated with disco, which in the year of 1982 didn&#x27;t improve its chances of sales. Springfield later stated that she was surprised that the album came out at all: &quot;Every time I made an album, the company I&#x27;d made it for would be swallowed up. They&#x27;d fire everyone that you&#x27;d worked with and the enthusiasm would disappear with them. Then I had to fire the original producer because he had put half the budget up his nose... there was a point where I began to feel that I was just some company&#x27;s tax loss.&quot;

The British subsidiary of Polygram, a label the singer had been connected with for 25 years in various forms, declined its option to release the album in the UK; fans of Springfield&#x27;s in her native country consequently had to buy import copies from the US and Canada.

&quot;White Heat&quot; in its entirety was first issued in the UK in 2002 when it was released on CD by Mercury/Universal Music.

==Reception==

Reviewing the album in &quot;Record&quot;, Barry Alfonso commented, &quot;Springfield&#x27;s now stepped away from her earlier MOR approach and headed in a Grace Jones pop/funk direction. The results are uneven, but encouraging nonetheless.&quot; He elaborated that Springfield&#x27;s sensual approach to songs like &quot;I Am Curious&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Think We Could Ever Be Friends&quot; was perfect, while she mishandled ballads such as &quot;Losing You&quot; by taking a modern approach to them instead of the emotional thrust that was her trademark sound.

She was the sister of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and is traditionally thought to be the inspiration for &quot;Stella&quot; of Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot; sonnet sequence (published posthumously in 1591). She was married to Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich (later 1st Earl of Warwick) and had a public liaison with Charles Blount, Baron Mountjoy, whom she married in an unlicensed ceremony following her divorce from Rich. She died in 1607.

==Early life and first marriage==

Born Penelope Devereux at Chartley Castle in Staffordshire, she was the elder daughter of Walter Devereux, 2nd Viscount Hereford, later 1st Earl of Essex and Lettice Knollys, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys and Catherine Carey, and sister of William Knollys, later 1st Earl of Banbury. Catherine Carey was the daughter of Lady Mary Boleyn by either her husband Sir William Carey, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, or her lover King Henry VIII.

Her father was created Earl of Essex in 1572. Penelope was a child of twelve when Sir Philip Sidney accompanied her distant cousin Queen Elizabeth I on a visit to Lady Essex in 1575, on her way from Kenilworth, and must have been frequently thrown into the society of Sidney, in consequence of the many ties between the two families. Essex died in Dublin in September 1576. He had sent a message to Philip Sidney from his death-bed expressing his desire that he should marry his daughter, and later his secretary wrote to the young man&#x27;s father, Sir Henry Sidney, in words which seem to point to the existence of a very definite understanding.

Penelope&#x27;s brother, Robert, Viscount Hereford, inherited the Earldom of Essex on their father&#x27;s death in 1576, and Penelope, her sister Dorothy, and younger brother Walter were entrusted to the guardianship of their kinsman Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. In 1578 their widowed mother married the Queen&#x27;s favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Perhaps the marriage of Lady Essex with the earl of Leicester, which destroyed Philip Sidney&#x27;s prospects as his uncle Leicester&#x27;s heir, had something to do with the breaking off of the proposed match with Penelope.

She had a strict Puritan upbringing and quite a simple life until she was presented at Court in early 1581. In January, she arrived at court accompanied by her guardian&#x27;s wife, Catherine, Countess of Huntingdon, who was Leicester&#x27;s sister and Sidney&#x27;s aunt. In March 1581 Huntingdon as her guardian secured the queen&#x27;s assent through Lord Burghley, Master of the Court of Wards, for her marriage with Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich (later 1st Earl of Warwick). Penelope is said to have protested in vain against the alliance with Rich. The marriage was unhappy from the start, and Philip Sidney continued to have an emotional attachment to her until his death in 1586.

Penelope&#x27;s children by Robert Rich were:
*Lettice Rich (d. 1619), named after her maternal grandmother Lettice Knollys and known as Lucy. Married firstly Sir George Carey and secondly Sir Arthur Lake
*Essex Rich, married Sir Thomas Cheek and had three sons and five daughters
*Robert Rich (1587–1658), later 2nd Earl of Warwick
*Henry Rich (1590–1649), later 1st Earl of Holland

==Poets&#x27; muse==

Penelope Rich was considered one of the beauties of Elizabeth&#x27;s court. She was golden-haired with dark eyes, a gifted singer and dancer, fluent in French, Italian, and Spanish.

Penelope is traditionally thought to have inspired Philip Sidney&#x27;s sonnet sequence &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot; (sometimes spelt &quot;Astrophil and Stella&quot;). Likely composed in the 1580s, it is the first of the famous English sonnet sequences, and contains 108 sonnets and 11 songs. Many of the poems were circulated in manuscript form before the first edition was printed by Thomas Newman in 1591, five years after Sidney&#x27;s death. They were set by the French lutenist Charles Tessier and published in London in 1597.
Whether Sidney fell passionately in love with Penelope in the years between her arrival at court in 1581 and his own marriage in 1583, or whether the &quot;Stella&quot; sonnets were courtly amusements reflecting fashionable poetic conceits may never be known. In her essay &quot;Sidney, Stella, and Lady Rich&quot;, Katherine Duncan-Jones writes:

Sidney died of wounds received at the Battle of Zutphen in 1586. In 1590, Penelope&#x27;s brother Essex married Sidney&#x27;s widow Frances, daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, and Lady Rich was much cultivated by poets and musicians during her brother&#x27;s ascendancy at court in the 1590s. Poet Richard Barnfield dedicated &quot;The Affectionate Shepherd&quot;, his first work, which was published anonymously in November 1594, to Penelope Rich. Bartholomew Yong dedicated his translation of Portuguese author Jorge de Montemor&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Books of the Diana&quot; (1598) to her; and sonnets are addressed to her by John Davies of Hereford.

In 1586 she was a godmother to the daughter of Nicholas Hilliard, the queen&#x27;s miniaturist. Hilliard is known to have painted two miniatures of Lady Rich, in 1589 and 1590 for her brother, the Earl of Essex. He sent one to James VI of Scotland (later James I of England), and the poet Henry Constable wrote a sonnet about the portrait. Essex gave the second miniature to the French ambassador for Henry IV. A miniature in the Royal Collection (above) may be one of these. Queen Anne of Scotland asked for portraits of the Earl of Essex and Lady Rich in December 1595.

Charles Tessier dedicated his book of part-songs in French and Italian, &quot;Le premier livre de chansons&quot;, to &quot;Madame Riche&quot;, commending (in Italian) her musical judgement, and John Dowland composed &quot;My Lady Rich&#x27;s Galliard&quot; in her honour.

==Affair and charge of treason==
Penelope&#x27;s arranged marriage to Rich had been unhappy, and by 1595 she began a secret affair with Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy. Lord Rich took no action during the lifetime of Penelope&#x27;s brother, the powerful Earl of Essex, who became the ageing Queen&#x27;s favourite in the years after the death of Leicester in 1588.

However Penelope became tainted by association with her brother&#x27;s plotting. Essex shocked many people, after the failure of his rebellion, by denouncing her as a traitor, and after his execution for treason in 1601, Lord Rich had Penelope and her children by Mountjoy cast out. Mountjoy, like Penelope, had been implicated in the Essex rebellion, but the Queen, who wished to show as much clemency as possible to the rebels, took no action against either of them. Lady Rich moved in with her lover, and the couple began a very public relationship. Mountjoy was created Earl of Devonshire on the accession of James I, and Lady Rich was in high favour at court.

She was among the ladies who rode north to Berwick-upon-Tweed to meet Anne of Denmark in May 1603 and escorted the new queen on her entry to London. She served Anne as a Lady of the Bedchamber. The French ambassador the Marquis de Rosny identified her as an influential courtier, and gave her a diamond-set miniature portrait of Henry IV of France. She was one of the ladies in waiting &quot;taken out&quot; from the audience to dance during &quot;The Masque of Indian and China Knights&quot; at Hampton Court on 1 January 1604. She danced as the nymph Ocyte in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Masque of Blackness&quot; on Twelfth Night 1605.

In 1605, Rich sued for a divorce, and Penelope wanted to marry Blount and legitimise their children. In the divorce proceedings, she publicly admitted to adultery. The divorce was granted, but the requests to remarry and legitimise her children were refused. She married Blount in a private ceremony conducted by his chaplain, William Laud, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, on 26 December 1605 at Wanstead House in London. This proceeding, carried out in defiance of canon law, was followed by the disgrace of both parties, who were banished from court by King James. The couple continued to live together as husband and wife with their children until his death a few months later. Blount died on 3 April 1606 and Penelope on 7 July 1607.

Penelope&#x27;s illegitimate children acknowledged by Charles Blount were:

* Penelope Rich, who, despite her surname, was a daughter of Penelope by Blount
*Mountjoy Blount (c.1597–1666), later 1st Earl of Newport
* Charles Blount
* St. John Blount
* Isabella Blount
* another child died in infancy

<text>The Serb People&#x27;s Party ( / &quot;Srpska narodna stranka, SNS&quot;) was a political party in Montenegro.

The SNS was led by Andrija Mandić. At the last legislative elections in Montenegro, on September 10, 2006, the Serb List, led by the SNS, won 12 out of 81 seats. It was then the largest political group in the Parliament of Montenegro right after the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists-Social Democratic Party coalition.

In January 2009, it merged with to People&#x27;s Socialist Party of Montenegro (NSS) to form the New Serb Democracy.

==Overview==
The SNS was an ethnic Serb party that promoted the rights of the Serb ethnic group against what it sees as state-sponsored discrimination. Unlike the pro-federalist Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro (SNP) which is left-oriented (being social-democratic), the SNS is focused primarily on representing the interests of Serb people in Montenegro around a center-right cultural conservative program. It presented itself as one of the successors to the old People&#x27;s Party in the founded in 1906 in the Kingdom of Montenegro, alongside the current People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro.

Its platform consisted of protection of the ethnic Serb community in the smaller republic against what it sees as the apartheid-like policies of the government of Milo Đukanović whom it has vehemently opposed since its creation. The SNS also supported a restoration of tighter relations between Serbia and Montenegro in conjunction with Euro-Atlantic integration.

In 1997 the People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro entered the To live better broad anti-Bulatović and anti-Milošević political alliance of Milo Đukanović. Numerous members of NS saw it betraying its own basis by siding with its greatest enemy and now also the enemy of the Serb people. NS CG had also distanced itself from its old Serbian nationalistic aims a lot and has become quite moderate, and these same members accused the party&#x27;s political leadership under Novak Kilibarda for abandoning the general interests of the Serbs. It is thus they left the party and formed the Serbian People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro ( / &quot;Srpska narodna stranka Crne Gore, SNS CG&quot;), which claims to continue to original policies of NS. The leader of the fraction, &quot;Božidar Bojović&quot;, was elected the SNS&#x27;s first leader. The fraction also supported Momir Bulatovic unlike mainstream NS which sided with Milo Djukanovic in the epic 1997-1998 presidential and party DPS changes. SNS CG refused to sign on 1 September 1997 the agreement of joint overseeing of the voting with representatives from political parties to evade repetition of future vote-balloting because they fiercely opposed any collaboration with Djukanovic, therefore cutting itself from inspecting the voting process.

The Serb People&#x27;s Party ran on the 1998 Montenegrin parliamentary election alone. It suffered a great defeat and lost enthusiasm, because it failed to pass the census and enter the Parliament.

The Serbian People&#x27;s Party decided to participate in the 24 October 2000 election for the Parliament of the Federal Republic, unlike the DPS ruling coalition of Đukanović which instituted a republican-sponsored boycott alleging the amended Constitution to promote inequality of Montenegro within the Yugoslavian federation (which the SNS sole parliamentarian at the time, vice-chairman Novica Stanić, voted against). In fact the Republican government of Đukanović made public threats to the 25% of electors who dared come out to vote. As a result of an agreement with the SNP, the SNS secured 2 seats of the Montenegrin portion of 30 seats in the 138-strong House of Citizens (with the remaining 108 belonging to Serbia). And at the election for the Chamber of Republics, SNS got even more - 9,494 or 7.5%. It secured a single seat for the 20 in the Montenegrin Dome of the 40-seat-strong Chamber of Republics. 

After Montenegrin independence referendum and proclamation of Montenegro&#x27;s independence, SNS has challenged the referendum as being rigged and fraud-ridden. Furthermore, it started a petition to make gaining of Serbian citizenship possible for Serbs from Montenegro. The SNS has stated that it will recognize and respect the Republic of Montenegro to the degree that it respects the civic and human rights of a third of its populace (the Serbs). The SNS has refused to vote in favor of the new Montenegrin Constitution adopted in October 2007, with even one of its parliamentarians, spokesman Dobrilo Dedeić publicly tearing the document in parliament, and vowing to fight against the state-sponsored policy of discrimination to the very end. Furthermore, challenging a law which would make it illegal to hold dual citizenship, party leader Mandić has also publicly, in parliament, acknowledged to have become a dual Serbian citizen, challenging Podgorica to act on its threats.

SNS began efforts to unite the Serb List into a single party, which would be more moderate in its position, for it to become a more desirable partner to civic and pro-Montenegrin opposition. However, the initiative has had moderate success, as Democratic Serb Party did not comply with merger, and few smaller Serb parties emerged from Serb List.

<text>Paul John Jerome Caponigro (December 7, 1932 – November 10, 2024) was an American photographer, writer and pianist. His best known photographs are &quot;Running White Deer&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Apple.&quot; His subject matter includes landscape and still life, taking an interest in natural forms. He was best known for his landscape works and for the mystical and spiritual qualities of his work. 

In 2001, Caponigro was awarded the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography. His work is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Museum of Modern Art, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

== Early life ==
Paul John Jerome Caponigro was born in Boston on December 7, 1932, to Italian immigrant parents, and started having interests in photography at age 13. However, he also had a strong passion in music and began to study music at Boston University College of Music in 1950, before eventually deciding to focus on studying photography at the California School of Fine Arts.

== Photography career ==
Caponigro studied with Minor White. His first one-man exhibition took place at the George Eastman House in 1958. In the 1960s Caponigro taught photography part-time at Boston University while consulting for the Polaroid Corporation on various technical research. In 1971, his work was exhibited in the group exhibition &quot;Le Groupe Libre Expression : Expo 5&quot;, presented by Jean-Claude Gautrand, at the Rencontres d&#x27;Arles festival in Arles, France.

He died on November 10, 2024 at his home in Cushing, Maine from congestive heart failure at the age of 91.

==Personal life==
Caponigro lived in El Rancho de San Sebastian during his time in New Mexico from 1973 to 1993. Caponigro was a dedicated pianist and considered his training with music to be essential to his photographic imagery.

His son, John Paul Caponigro, is a digital photographic artist. He was married to writer Eleanor Morris until their divorce in 1976.

<text>Sir Patrick Gardiner Hastings (17 March 1880 – 26 February 1952) was an English barrister and politician noted for his long and highly successful career as a barrister and his short stint as Attorney General. He was educated at Charterhouse School until 1896, when his family moved to continental Europe. There he learnt to shoot and ride horses, allowing him to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry during the Second Boer War. After demobilisation he worked briefly as an apprentice to an engineer in Wales before moving to London to become a barrister. Hastings joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901, and after two years of saving money for the call to the bar he qualified as a barrister on 15 June 1904.

Hastings first rose to prominence as a result of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examination. After his success in &quot;Gruban v Booth&quot; in 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King&#x27;s Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as &quot;Sievier v Wootton&quot; and &quot;Russell v Russell&quot;, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend in Northumberland. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the government after less than a year in power.

Following his resignation in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield to take a seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to his work as a barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 he was one of the highest paid barristers at the English bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also tried writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, &quot;The River&quot; was made into a silent film in 1927 named &quot;The Notorious Lady&quot;. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952.

==Early life==

Hastings was born on 17 March 1880 in London to Alfred Gardiner Hastings and Kate Comyns Carr, a pre-Raphaelite painter and the sister of J. Comyns Carr. Having been born on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Hastings was named after the saint. His father was a solicitor with &quot;somewhat seedy clients&quot;, and the family were repeatedly bankrupted. Despite financial difficulties, there was enough money in the family to send Hastings to a private preparatory school in 1890 and to Charterhouse School in 1894. Hastings disliked school, saying &quot;I hated the bell which drove us up in the morning, I hated the masters; above all I hated the work, which never interested me in the slightest degree&quot;. He was bullied at both the preparatory school and at Charterhouse, and did not excel at either sports or his studies.

By 1896 the family hit another period of financial trouble, and Hastings left Charterhouse to move to continental Europe with his mother and older brother Archie until there was enough money for the family to return to London. The family initially moved to Ajaccio in Corsica, where they bought several old guns and taught Hastings and his brother how to shoot. After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also learnt how to fish and ride horses.

While they were in the Ardennes, Hastings and his brother were arrested and briefly held for murder. While attending a fête in a nearby village Archie got into a disagreement with the local priest, who accused him of insulting the French church after misunderstanding one of his comments. The brothers returned to see the priest the next day to demand an apology. On their way home after receiving it, they were stopped by two gendarmes who arrested them for murder, informing them that the priest had been found dead ten minutes after they left. As the gendarmes prepared to take the Hastings to the police station, two more officers turned up with a villager in handcuffs. It transpired that the priest had been having an affair with the villager&#x27;s sister, and after waiting for the Hastingses to leave he had killed the priest with a brick. The brothers were quickly released.

Soon after this incident, the family moved from the Ardennes to Brussels after a message from their father that the financial problems had ended. When they reached Brussels they found that the situation had actually worsened, and the family moved between cheap hotels, each one worse than the one before. Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted an apprenticeship with an English engineer who claimed to have made a machine to extract gold in North Wales. After about a year and a half of work they discovered that there was no gold to be found in that part of Wales, and Hastings was informed that his services would no longer be needed.

==Military service and call to the bar==

Hastings left the failed mining operation in 1899, and travelled to London. Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required were that the recruit could ride and shoot, and Hastings immediately applied to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and after two weeks of training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. &quot;Goth Castle&quot; to South Africa. The ship reached Cape Town after three weeks, and the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, and so they were discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers. Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor, the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.

Hastings was made a scout, a duty he thoroughly enjoyed; it meant that he got to the targeted farms first, and had time to steal chickens and other food before the Royal Military Police arrived (as looting was a criminal offence). Hastings was not a model soldier; as well as looting, he estimated that by the time he left the army he had &quot;been charged and tried upon almost every offence known to military law&quot;. After two years of fighting, the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902, bringing an end to the Second Boer War, and his regiment was returned to London and demobilised.

By the time Hastings returned, he had decided to become a barrister. There were various problems with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the bar, was a member of the Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 (equivalent to approximately £ in 2015) when he was called to the bar and Hastings was literally penniless.

As soon as he joined the Middle Temple, Hastings began saving money for his call to the bar, starting with half a crown from the sale of his Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal to a pawnbroker. The rules and regulations of the Inns of Court meant that a student was not allowed to work as a &quot;tradesperson&quot; but there was no rule against working as a journalist, and his cousin Philip Carr, a drama critic for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, got him a job writing a gossip column for the &quot;News&quot; for one pound a week. This job lasted about three months; both he and Carr were fired after Hastings wrote a piece for the paper that should have been done by Carr. Despite this, his new contacts within journalism allowed him to get temporary jobs writing play reviews for the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Field&quot;. After two years of working eighteen-hour days he had saved £60 of the £100 needed to be called to the bar, but had still not studied for the examinations as he could not afford to buy any law books. Over the next year his income decreased, as he was forced to study for the examinations rather than work for newspapers. By the end of May 1904 he had the £100 needed, and he was called to the bar on 15 June.

==Career as a barrister==

At the time, there was no organised way for a new barrister to find a pupil master or set of barristers&#x27; chambers, and in addition the barrister would be expected to pay the pupil master between 50 and 100 guineas (equivalent to between £ and £ in 2015). This was out of the question for Hastings; thanks to the cost of his call to the bar, he was so poor that his wig and robes had to be bought on credit. Instead he wandered around Middle Temple and by chance ran into Frederick Corbet, the only practising barrister he knew. After Hastings explained his situation, Corbet offered him a place in his set of chambers, which Hastings immediately accepted. Although he now had a place in chambers, Hastings had no way of getting a pupillage (Corbet dealt only with Privy Council cases) and he instead decided to teach himself by watching cases at the Royal Courts of Justice. Hastings was lucky: the first case he saw involved Rufus Isaacs, Henry Duke and Edward Carson, three of the most distinguished English barristers of the early 20th century. For the next six weeks until the court vacation, Hastings followed these three barristers from court to court &quot;like a faithful hound&quot;.

===Finding a tenancy===

At the start of the court vacation in August 1904, Hastings decided that it would be best to find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet dealt with only two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet&#x27;s was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.

Hastings finished the book just before the court vacation ended, and presented the draft to Gill immediately. Gill did not offer Hastings a place in his chambers but instead gave him a copy of a brief &quot;to see if he could make a note on it that would be any use to [Gill]&quot;. He spent hours writing notes and &quot;did everything to the brief except set it to music&quot;, before returning it to a pleased Gill, who let him take away another brief. Over the next two years Gill allowed him to work on nearly every case he appeared in. Eventually he was noticed by solicitors, who left briefs for him rather than for Gill. By the end of his first year as a barrister, he had earned 60 guineas, and by the end of his second year he had earned £200 (equivalent to approximately £ and £ respectively in 2015).

On 1 June 1906, Hastings married Mary Grundy, the daughter of retired Lieutenant Colonel F. L. Grundy, at All Saints&#x27; Church, Kensington. They had met through his uncle J. Comyns Carr&#x27;s family, who had brought Hastings to dinner at the Grundys&#x27; house. After several meetings Hastings proposed, but the wedding was put off for a long time due to his lack of money. In January 1906, Hastings became the temporary secretary of John Simon, who had just become a Member of Parliament, and when he left the position Simon gave him a cheque for £50. Hastings and his fiancée had &quot;never had so much money before&quot;, and on the strength of this they decided to get married. His marriage changed his outlook on life: he now realised that to provide for his wife he would need to work a lot harder at getting cases. To do that he would need to join a well-respected set of chambers; although Gill was giving him briefs he was still in Corbet&#x27;s chambers, which saw little business.

Hastings approached Gill and asked him for a place in his chambers. Gill&#x27;s chambers were full but he did suggest a well-respected barrister named F. E. Smith, and Hastings went to see him with a letter of recommendation from Gill. Smith was out and Hastings instead spoke to his clerk; the two did not get on, and Hastings left without securing a place. Hastings later described this as &quot;the most fortunate moment of my whole career&quot;. Directly below Smith&#x27;s chambers were those of Horace Avory, one of the most noted barristers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As he prepared to return home, Hastings was informed that Chartres Biron (one of the barristers who occupied Avory&#x27;s chambers) had been appointed a Metropolitan Magistrate, which freed up a space in the chambers. He immediately went to Avory&#x27;s clerk and got him to introduce him to Avory. Avory initially refused to give Hastings a place in the chambers, but after Hastings lost his temper and exclaimed that &quot;if he didn&#x27;t want me to help him it would leave me more time to myself&quot;, Avory laughed and changed his mind.

===His own chambers===
In 1910, Horace Avory became a judge. Hastings first found out when he read the report in the morning newspapers, and was dismayed that he would again have to search for a tenancy at another chambers. He instead had the idea that he could take over Avory&#x27;s chambers himself, allowing him to avoid the trouble of finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he had the money. Despite Avory&#x27;s reputation as &quot;cold and hard&quot; he agreed to this idea, and even let Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory&#x27;s valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland. Although this was a good start, Hastings was not a particularly well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.

====The Case of the Hooded Man====
His first major case was &quot;The Case of the Hooded Man&quot;. On 9 October 1912, the driver of a horse-drawn carriage noticed a crouching man near the front door of the house of Countess Flora Sztaray in Eastbourne. Sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and to be married to a rich Hungarian nobleman, and assuming that the crouching man was a burglar the driver immediately called the police. Inspector Arthur Walls was sent to investigate, and ordered the man to come down. The man fired two shots, the first of which struck and killed Walls.

A few days after the murder, a former medical student named Edgar Power contacted the police, showing them a letter that he claimed had been written by the murderer. It read &quot;If you would save my life come here at once to 4 Tideswell Road. Ask for Seymour. Bring some cash with you. Very Urgent.&quot; Power told the police that the letter had been written by a friend of his called John Williams, who he claimed had visited Sztaray&#x27;s house to burgle it before killing the policeman and fleeing. Williams then met with his girlfriend Florence Seymour and explained what had happened. The two decided to bury the gun on the beach and send a letter to Williams&#x27; brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power.

Power helped the police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour that the police knew what had happened and that the only way to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere safer. When Seymour and Power went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Power (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Power again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.

Williams&#x27; case came to trial on 12 December 1912 at Lewes Assizes, with Hastings for the defence. Despite a strong argument and little direct evidence against Williams, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. The case generated large amounts of publicity, as well as an appeal hearing at which Hastings demonstrated his legal skills. The case established him as an excellent barrister, particularly when it came to cross-examination. He was commended by both the initial judge, Arthur Channell, and the presiding judge hearing the appeal, Lord Alverstone, for his skill in his defence of Williams. The advertisement this case gave of his skills allowed him to move some of his practice from the county courts to the High Court of Justice, where his work slowly increased in value and size.

The case made his name well-known and helped bring him work, but he still mainly worked on cases in the county courts. These did not pay particularly well, and to get around this lack of money his clerk had him take on six new pupils at once. The short length of county court cases and the number of cases Hastings got meant that he dealt with up to six cases in a single day, running from court to court with his pupils in a &quot;Mafeking procession&quot; which he later described as &quot;the forerunners of the modern Panzer division&quot;.

====First World War====
Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Hastings and his family were preparing to travel to Germany for a holiday. On the day of departure he received a note from a client, which read &quot;You tell me you are going to Germany. Don&#x27;t go, we shall be at war within forty-eight hours&quot;. Hastings heeded this warning, and remained in England – war was declared between Britain and Germany less than two days later. Hastings himself volunteered to serve in the armed forces, but was rejected as medically unfit.

====&quot;Gruban v Booth&quot;====

His next noted civil case was that of &quot;Gruban v Booth&quot;. John Gruban was a German-born businessman, originally named Johann Wilhelm Gruban, who had come to England in 1893 to work for an engineering company, Haigh and Company. By 1913 he had turned the business from an almost-bankrupt company to a successful manufacturer of machine tools, and at the outbreak of the First World War it was one of the first companies to produce machine tools used to make munitions. This made Gruban a major figure in a now-large market, and he attempted to raise £5,000 to expand his business (equivalent to approximately £ in 2015). On independent advice, he contacted Frederick Handel Booth, a noted Liberal Member of Parliament who was chairman of the Yorkshire Iron and Coal Company and had led the government inquiry into the Marconi scandal. When Gruban contacted Booth, Booth told him that he could do &quot;more for [your] company than any man in England&quot;, claiming that David Lloyd George (at the time Minister of Munitions) and many other important government officials were close friends. With £3,500 borrowed from his brother-in-law, Booth immediately invested in Gruban&#x27;s company.

Booth worked his way into the company with a string of false claims about his influence, and finally became chairman of the Board of Directors by claiming that it was the only way to avoid Gruban being interned due to his German origin. As soon as this happened, he cut Gruban out of the company, leaving him destitute, and eventually arranged for him to be interned. Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.

The case of &quot;Gruban v Booth&quot; opened on 7 May 1917 in the King&#x27;s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in front of Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that on the final day the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts. While both Rigby Smith and Douglas Hogg were highly respected barristers, Booth&#x27;s cross-examination by Hastings was so skilfully done that the jury took only ten minutes to find that he had been fraudulent; they awarded Gruban £4,750 (about £ in 2015).

===King&#x27;s Counsel===
His success in &quot;Gruban v Booth&quot; allowed Hastings to switch his practice from the county courts to the High Court, and at the beginning of Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King&#x27;s Counsel (KC). Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this he decided to take the risk, and he was accepted later that year.

====Select Committee of the House of Lords====

His first major case as a King&#x27;s Counsel was representing a Colonel Bersey at the Select Committee of the House of Lords on the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force. Bersey was a senior officer of the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force (WRAF), and along with several other officers he had been accused of conspiring to have the WRAF Commandant, Violet Douglas-Pennant, removed from office to cover up &quot;rife immorality&quot; going on at WRAF camps. Lord Stanhope formed a House of Lords Select Committee to investigate these claims, and it began sitting on 14 October 1918.

Hastings took the lead in cross-examining Douglas-Pennant. She accused Bersey and others of promoting this &quot;rife immorality&quot; and not having the best interests of the WRAF at heart. When cross examined, however, she was unable to provide any evidence of this &quot;rife immorality&quot; or any kind of a conspiracy, saying that she could not find any specific instance of &quot;immorality&quot; at the camps she visited and that it was &quot;always rumour&quot;. After three weeks the committee dismissed all witnesses. The final report was produced in December 1919, and found that Douglas-Pennant had been completely unable to substantiate her claims and was deserving &quot;of the gravest censure&quot;. As a result, Douglas-Pennant was never again employed by the government.

====Libel and divorce====

During his time at the bar, Hastings was involved in a variety of libel cases and in a divorce case which significantly changed the law relating to the admission of evidence from spouses regarding the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child. His first significant libel case was &quot;Sievier v Wootton&quot;. Robert Sievier was a well-known horse racing journalist and owner with a reputation for brushes with the law and underhanded dealings, having previously been tried for blackmail and acquitted on a technicality. In 1913 he accused Richard Wootton, a noted trainer of racehorses, of ordering his jockeys to withdraw from races if he had bet on another horse so as to allow him to make large amounts of money. Wootton sued him for libel and won, but was granted only a symbolic farthing in damages because the jury thought that Sievier had not intended to cause harm. As a result of this pyrrhic victory, Wootton held a grudge against Sievier for many years.

As revenge, Wootton wrote a pamphlet titled &quot;Incidents in the Public Life of Robert Standish Sievier&quot; in which he claimed that Sievier had been expelled from the Victoria Racing Club, twice been declared bankrupt, cheated a man of £600 in a game of billiards and blackmailed another for £5,000. The pamphlet was released on the day of the Grand National and distributed widely through the crowds, and in response Sievier sued Wootton for libel. Sievier appeared without a lawyer, while Wootton was represented by Sir Edward Carson, Hastings, and E. H. Spence. After the second day of the trial, Carson was called away to Ireland on political business, and Hastings was forced to act as the primary counsel for Wootton. Hastings destroyed Sievier&#x27;s reputation in cross-examination, and the jury decided in Wootton&#x27;s favour.

In 1922, he became involved in &quot;Russell v Russell&quot;, which eventually went to the House of Lords, who set a common law rule that evidence about the legitimacy or illegitimacy of children born in marriage is inadmissible if it is given by either spouse. John Russell, later Lord Ampthill, married Christabel Hart in 1918, with both spouses agreeing that they did not want to have children. In October 1921 Christabel Russell gave birth to a son, Geoffrey Russell, and John Russell immediately filed for divorce and to have the child declared a bastard. He claimed that the child could not be his because he had not had sexual intercourse with his wife since August 1920.

Hastings represented Christabel Russell in the initial trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who by a majority of three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgement) overturned the previous judgements and said that John Russell&#x27;s evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Christabel Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.

==Politics==
Hastings first became involved in politics after the First World War, when he joined the Liberal Party to help improve social conditions for the poorer people of the United Kingdom. He was being prepared to be the Liberal candidate for Ilford in the 1918 general election but grew disheartened by the Liberal alliance with the Conservative Party, and also by the divisions in the party; as a result, he gave up the candidacy.

Hastings eventually switched sides and joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially in the light of later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, came to the conclusion that Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.

After an interview with Sidney and Beatrice Webb he became the Labour candidate for Wallsend in December 1920. Beatrice Webb was later to write in her diaries that Hastings was &quot;without any sincerely held public purpose&quot; and &quot;an unpleasant type of clever pleader and political &quot;arriviste&quot;, who jumped into the Labour Party just before the 1922 election, when it had become clear that the Labour Party was the alternative government and it had not a single lawyer of position attached to it&quot;. However Hastings was returned for Wallsend with a majority of 2,823 in the 1922 general election.

After returning to London from Wallsend, he attended a full meeting of Labour MPs to decide who would become the Party Chairman. This effectively meant choosing the leader of Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition, because Labour was the largest opposition party in the House of Commons. The two candidates were Ramsay MacDonald and J. R. Clynes, and Hastings, who supported MacDonald, persuaded six new MPs to support him. MacDonald was elected by a margin of only five votes, and Hastings later regretted his support.

Hastings was indeed Labour&#x27;s only experienced barrister in the House of Commons at that time, and immediately became a frontbencher and the party&#x27;s main spokesman on legal matters. He made his debut speech on 22 February 1923 against the Rent Restrictions Bill, an amendment to the Rent Act 1921. He attacked it as &quot;a monstrous piece of legislation&quot;, and was repeatedly shouted down by Conservative MPs as a &quot;traitor to his class&quot;. As a result of this and the slow workings of Parliament, Hastings quickly became frustrated by politics.

===Internment orders===
Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State was set up as an independent British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces and members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island, the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA was forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March the Free State government provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O&#x27;Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O&#x27;Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.

The next day the arrests were publicly queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W. C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it perfectly legal. Hastings immediately stood and protested, saying that the act was &quot;one of the most dreadful things that has been done in the history of our country&quot; and that the internments and deportations were effectively illegal.

A few days later, the solicitors for O&#x27;Brien got in contact with Hastings. On 23 March 1923 he appeared in &quot;R v Secretary of State for Home Affairs ex parte O&#x27;Brien&quot; [1923] 2 KB 361 at a divisional court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for O&#x27;Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing was ineffective because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O&#x27;Brien, which was required for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, were effectively repealed.

The court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, an English divisional court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O&#x27;Brien. Three days later, Hastings took the case to the Court of Appeal, who declared that the internment orders were invalid since the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 was no longer applicable. The government was forced to introduce a bill to Parliament giving itself retrospective immunity for having exceeded its authority, and the whole incident was a political and legal triumph for the party and for Hastings personally.

===Attorney-General===
When the new Parliament opened in 1923, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin suggested that tariff reform was the best way to solve Britain&#x27;s economic difficulties. Unfortunately Bonar Law, his predecessor, had promised that there would be no tariff reforms introduced during the current Parliament. Baldwin felt that the only solution was to call a new general election. In the ensuing election Baldwin&#x27;s Conservatives lost 88 seats, with the Labour Party gaining 47 and the Liberal Party gaining 41. This produced a hung parliament, and Labour and the Liberals formed a coalition government with Labour as the main party. Hastings himself was re-elected without difficulty, increasing his majority.

With Ramsay MacDonald as the new Prime Minister in the first Labour government, Hastings was appointed Attorney-General for England and Wales. This was not surprising: Labour had only two KCs in Parliament, and the other (Edward Hemmerde) was &quot;unsuitable for personal reasons&quot;. Hastings hesitated before accepting the appointment, despite the knighthood and appointment as head of the bar that came with the post, and later said that &quot;if I had known what the next year was to bring forward I should almost certainly have [declined]&quot;.

Hastings described his time as Attorney General as &quot;my idea of hell&quot; – he was the only Law Officer available, since the Solicitor General was not a Member of Parliament, and as a result had to answer all queries about points of law in Parliament. In addition, he had his normal duties of dealing with the legal problems of government departments, and said that the day was &quot;one long rush between the law courts, government departments and the House of Commons&quot;. His working hours were regularly between 7am and 5am the following morning, and the policemen on duty at the House of Commons complained to him that he was working too long, since they were required to stay on duty as long as he was.

===Campbell Case===
In 1924 Hastings became involved in the Campbell Case, a prosecution which eventually led to the downfall of the Labour government. On 30 June 1924, he was met by Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who brought with him a copy of the communist newspaper &quot;Workers&#x27; Weekly&quot;. The newspaper contained an article which urged members of the military to refuse to shoot their &quot;fellow workers&quot; in a time of war. Hastings approved the prosecution of the newspaper&#x27;s editor, J. R. Campbell, for violating the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797.
On 6 August Campbell&#x27;s house was raided, and he was arrested by the police. On the same day John Scurr, a Labour backbencher, asked the Home Secretary why Campbell had been detained and on whose orders. Hastings himself read out a reply, which said that the Director of Public Prosecutions had complained that the article was inciting troops to mutiny. Another Labour backbencher, Jimmy Maxton, rose and asked the Prime Minister &quot;if he has read the article, and if he is aware that the article contains mainly a call to the troops not to allow themselves to be used in industrial disputes, and that that point of view is shared by a large number of Members sitting on these benches?&quot; This statement lead to uproar, and the Speaker was forced to intervene and halt further discussions.

The next day Hastings called for both the Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to ask their opinion on the prosecution. Maxton knew Campbell, and revealed that he was only the temporary editor and had not written the article – the article had actually been copied from another newspaper. Along with Guy Stevenson, the assistant director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged.

The reaction of the public and the press was that the case had been thrown out because of direct pressure from the government, and that this had happened behind closed doors. MacDonald was &quot;furious&quot;, and the opinion of the Liberal and Conservative parties was that the government was attempting to pervert the course of justice. On 30 September Sir Kingsley Wood, a Conservative MP, asked the Prime Minister in Parliament whether he had instructed the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw the case. MacDonald replied that &quot;I was not consulted regarding either the institution or the subsequent withdrawal of these proceedings&quot;.

A Parliamentary debate and motion to censure the Labour government on this was set for 8 October, but before this MacDonald called Hastings into his office and suggested a way to solve the problem. Hastings would accept all the blame and resign as Attorney General, and in exchange MacDonald and the rest of the cabinet would speak for Hastings at the resulting by-election. Hastings refused the general suggestion, but planned to make a speech at the upcoming debate explaining his actions.
Immediately after the debate began the Prime Minister rose to speak, and said that he &quot;sought to correct the impression [I] gave&quot; that he knew nothing about the prosecution. This was followed by a motion of censure pushed forward by Robert Horne, and after Horne had presented the motion Hastings rose to speak, and explained the facts of the case. His speech took over an hour, and was frequently interrupted by Conservative MPs. In his speech, Hastings took full responsibility for both the decision to prosecute and the subsequent decision to withdraw the prosecution, asking whether a censure was merited for correcting a mistake. His speech quieted the Conservatives and made it clear that a censure for the entire Parliament was going to be difficult for the Whips to enforce. The Liberal spokesman John Simon stood to speak, however, and called for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the case. This was rejected by MacDonald, and MPs continued to speak for several more hours.

The Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin privately wrote to MacDonald offering to withdraw the motion of censure in exchange for the government&#x27;s support for the appointment of a Select Committee. MacDonald consulted with Jimmy Thomas and Hastings (whose reply was simply &quot;Go to hell&quot;) and decided to reject the offer. Although the motion of censure failed, the motion to appoint a Select Committee passed the House over the opposition of the government, and the Labour government was forced out of office. Hastings was embittered by the disaster, and considered immediately quitting politics altogether, although he did not do so. His plight was depicted on the cover of Time Magazine, along with a quotation (&quot;What have I done wrong?&quot;) from his speech.

===Remaining time in politics===
Hastings was again returned for Wallsend at the ensuing election, despite the crisis caused by the Zinoviev letter, although with a reduced majority. Although Hastings remained on the Labour frontbench he rarely spoke in the House of Commons, and attended less and less frequently. After suffering from kidney problems during 1925, he left Parliament by accepting the nominal position of Steward of the Manor of Northstead — a legal fiction office with the same effect as, but less well known than, the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds) on 29 June 1926; this enabled Margaret Bondfield, who had lost her seat in the previous election, to return to Parliament in his place at the ensuing by-election. He never returned to politics.

==Return to the bar==
After leaving politics, Hastings returned to his work as a barrister, and eventually surpassed even his previous reputation and success as an advocate. His first major case after returning was representing F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, a noted professional explorer, in his libel action against London Express Newspapers, the owner of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; had published two articles saying that he was a liar, and had planned out a bogus robbery to advertise a device known as the Monomark. The case opened on 9 February 1928 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings and Norman Birkett representing Mitchell-Hedges and William Jowitt and J.B. Melville representing London Express Newspapers. Despite the skills of both Hastings and Birkett, who later became a much-lauded barrister in his own right, Mitchell-Hedges lost his case and had his reputation destroyed as a result.

===Savidge Inquiry===

In 1928, Hastings became involved in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.

After his release, Money immediately spoke to his official contacts, and the next morning the matter was raised in the House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had Metropolitan Police Commissioner William Horwood appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.

The next day, two police officers (Inspector Collins and Sergeant Clarke) and one policewoman (Lilian Wyles) called at Savidge&#x27;s workplace and took her to Scotland Yard, where she was questioned. The events of that day were brought up two days later in the House of Commons, where it was alleged that Savidge had been given a &quot;third degree&quot; interview by Collins lasting for five hours. After public outcry, the Home Secretary appointed a tribunal to investigate.

The tribunal (led by Sir John Eldon Bankes, a former Lord Justice of Appeal) began sitting on 15 May 1928; Hastings, Henry Curtis-Bennett and Walter Frampton represented Savidge, and Norman Birkett represented the police. When called as a witness, Savidge testified that she had not wanted to go to Scotland Yard and had been persuaded to do so by the presence of a female police officer, Miss Wyles. After they arrived at Scotland Yard, Collins told Wyles that he was going to send Savidge home, and Wyles could leave. After Wyles had left, Collins began interviewing Savidge, threatening that she and Money would &quot;suffer severely&quot; if she did not tell the truth. Savidge said that Collins&#x27; manner had become more and more familiar during the interview, and that at several points he and Sergeant Clarke had implied that they wanted her to have sexual intercourse with them. Savidge spent almost six hours in the witness box, and her testimony left Collins looking guilty in the eyes of the tribunal. Collins, Clarke and Wyles were all interviewed, along with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Archibald Bodkin himself.

The final report of the tribunal was released on 13 June 1928 and consisted of both a majority report and a minority one, since not all of the tribunal members agreed on the validity of Savidge&#x27;s evidence. The majority report said that Savidge was not intimidated into answering questions, nor treated inappropriately, and that &quot;we are unable therefore to accept Miss Savidge&#x27;s statement. We are satisfied that the interrogation followed the lines indicated to [Collins] by the Director of Public Prosecutions and was not unduly extended&quot;. The minority report blamed the police, particularly Collins, for the method in which Savidge was interviewed. The inquiry resulted in three changes to police procedure, however: firstly, that anyone interrogated should be told beforehand about the possible consequences and purpose of the statement; secondly, that the statement should normally be taken at home; and thirdly, that in cases &quot;involving matters intimately affecting [a woman&#x27;s] morals&quot; another woman should always be present for any interviews.

===&quot;United Diamond Fields v Joel&quot;===
Hastings was next involved in &quot;United Diamond Fields of British Guiana Ltd v Joel and Others&quot;, which he considered both his most difficult and most interesting case. Following the discovery of the diamond mines in South Africa, men such as Solly Joel had established a diamond syndicate to restrict the amount of diamonds on the market. For this to work, they had to control the entire output of diamonds in the world, which they planned to do by acquiring interests in all of the diamond mines. In 1925, British Guiana began producing enough diamonds to attract the attention of the syndicate, and in November 1925 a Mr Oppenheimer, representing the syndicate, entered into a contract with Mr Perez, the operator of the Guiana mines, to have worth of diamonds provided to the syndicate over a twelve-month period.

A few months later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was incorporated as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer as a technical adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor&#x27;s certificate at the end of that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.

To correct this, the syndicate were forced to reduce the flow of diamonds from British Guiana, which they did by getting Oppenheimer to reduce the price of Guianan diamonds to the point where the company output dropped from a month to less than per month. Oppenheimer then claimed that the profits were only five per cent, forcing the company to reduce the price yet again. As a result of this the company was forced into liquidation in September 1927.

A company board member, Victor Coen, was convinced that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five per cent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen per cent.

The trial began before Mr Justice McCardie on 4 March 1930, with Hastings for the company, and Stuart Bevan and Norman Birkett for the syndicate. The first witness called was Coen himself, who Hastings later described as &quot;the best witness without exception that I have ever seen in the witness-box&quot;. He was interviewed over seven days by Hastings, then Bevan and then Birkett. Eight days into the trial the matter of the certificate came up, and Oppenheimer was unable to provide an explanation. As a result, the jury found against the syndicate; they were ordered to pay back all of the company&#x27;s costs, and all of its losses.

===Royal Mail Case===

In 1931, Hastings represented John Morland in the Royal Mail Case. The director of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus with the aid of the company accountant, John Morland, to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. At the same time, he had been falsifying accounting records by drawing money from the reserves and having it appear on the records as profit. Following an independent audit instigated by the Treasury, Kylsant and John Morland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and the company records and accounts.

The trial began at the Old Bailey on 20 July 1931 before Mr Justice Wright, with Sir William Jowitt, D. N. Pritt and Eustace Fulton for the prosecution, Sir John Simon, J. E. Singleton and Wilfred Lewis for Lord Kylsant, and Hastings, Stuart Bevan, James Tucker and C. J. Conway for John Morland. Both defendants pleaded not guilty.

The main defence on the use of secret reserve accounting came with the help of Lord Plender. Plender was one of the most important and reliable accountants in Britain, and under cross-examination stated that it was routine for firms &quot;of the very highest repute&quot; to use secret reserves in calculating profit without declaring it. Hastings said that &quot;if my client ... was guilty of a criminal offence, there is not a single accountant in the City of London or in the world who is not in the same position.&quot; Both Kylsant and Morland were acquitted of falsifying records, but Kylsant was found guilty of &quot;making, circulating or publishing a written statement which he knew to be false&quot;, namely the 1928 prospectus, and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

===Elvira Barney===
Well known to dislike appearing in capital cases and having a heavy workload, Hastings hesitated in 1932 when approached by Sir John Mullens, a trustee of the Stock Exchange, to defend his daughter Elvira Mullens Barney on a charge of murder. Mrs Barney, who led a dissolute life of partying and drug-taking, was accused of shooting her lover in the Knightsbridge mews house they shared; she insisted that her gun had gone off by accident in a struggle. Hastings was persuaded to take the case by his wife who remembered that their children had shared a governess who had also cared for &quot;dear little Elvira&quot;. He appeared at the Magistrates&#x27; Court, where he cross-examined the forensic scientist Sir Bernard Spilsbury and at a three-day trial in the Old Bailey where Hastings was described by Peter Cotes in his book about the case as &quot;the star performer&quot;.

At the Old Bailey one of the principal crown witnesses was firearms expert Robert Churchill, who testified that the trigger of Mrs Barney&#x27;s gun had a strong pull. When Hastings rose to cross-examine, he took up the gun, pointed it to the ceiling and repeatedly pulled the trigger over and over again. One crown witness had said that on another occasion she saw Elvira Barney firing the gun while holding it in her left hand; when he called his client Hastings had the gun placed in front of her. After a pause he shouted at her to pick up the gun and she spontaneously picked it up in her right hand. The judge (Mr Justice Humphreys) described Hastings&#x27; final address as &quot;certainly one of the finest speeches I have ever heard at the Bar&quot; and Elvira Barney was found not guilty both of murder and manslaughter.

===Oswald Mosley===
Hastings appeared for Sir Oswald Mosley in several cases during the 1930s, having become friends with him while in Parliament. The first was a libel case against &quot;The Star&quot;, who had written a comment on one of Mosley&#x27;s speeches implying that he advocated an armed revolution to overthrow the British government. The case opened at the Royal Courts of Justice on 5 November 1934 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings representing Mosley, and Norman Birkett &quot;The Star&quot;. Birkett argued that &quot;The Star&quot; article was nothing more than a summary of Mosley&#x27;s speech, and that any comments implying the overthrow of the British government were found in the speech itself. Hastings countered that &quot;The Star&quot; was effectively accusing Mosley of high treason, and said that &quot;there is really no defence to this action...I do ask for such damages as will mark [the jury&#x27;s] sense of the injustice which has been done to Sir Oswald&quot;. The jury eventually decided that &quot;The Star&quot; had libelled Mosley, and awarded him £5,000 in damages (approximately £ in 2015).

Several weeks later, Hastings represented Mosley and three other members of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in a criminal case after they were indicted for &quot;causing a riotous assembly&quot; on 9 October 1934 at a BUF meeting. The trial opened at the Sussex Assizes on 18 December 1934 in front of Mr Justice Branson, with Hastings for the defence and John Flowers KC prosecuting. According to Mosley, Hastings told him that Flowers, a former cricketer, had a poor reputation at the bar, and that Mosley should not show him up too much. The prosecution claimed that after a BUF meeting, Mosley and the other defendants had marched around Worthing, threatening and assaulting civilians. Hastings argued that the defendants had been deliberately provoked by a crowd of civilians, and several witnesses testified that the crowd had been throwing tomatoes and threatening Mosley. The judge eventually directed the jury to return a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;. Hastings and Mosley were less successful in another libel action, against the Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen who had accused him of instructing his blackshirts to arm themselves. The defence, led by D. N. Pritt KC, called several witnesses to a fight in Manchester between blackshirts and their opponents. Hastings, taking the view that the incident was too long in the past to be relevant, did not call any rebutting evidence. Although Mosley won the case, he was awarded only a farthing in damages, traditionally a way for the jury to indicate that the case should not have been brought.

==Work as a playwright==
As well as his work as a barrister, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. His first play was &quot;The Moscow Doctor&quot;, based on a novel by Seton Merriman which he had rewritten; it ran for over a week in Brighton. He desired to have an original work performed, however, and to this end wrote &quot;The River&quot; over a period of 20 years before taking it to St James&#x27;s Theatre, where it was accepted and performed in June 1925. The play starred Owen Nares and initially went well, but foundered in the second act due to the plot requiring the most popular actors to be taken off stage – the character played by Nares, for example, broke his leg. Reviews compared the plot to something out of the &quot;Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot;. The play lasted only a month before being cancelled, but Hastings was able to sell the film rights for £2,000, and it was turned into a Hollywood film called &quot;The Notorious Lady&quot; starring Lewis Stone and Barbara Bedford.

His next play was titled &quot;Scotch Mist&quot;, and was put on at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre on 26 January 1926 starring Tallulah Bankhead and Godfrey Tearle. After a reviewer named St.John Ervine wrote a review starting &quot;this is the worst play I have ever seen&quot;, the performances bizarrely sold out for weeks later. The play was later called &quot;scandalous and immoral&quot; by the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, and as a result sold out for many months. Emboldened by this success Hastings wrote &quot;The Moving Finger&quot;, which despite moderately good reviews was not popular, and was withdrawn as a result. In 1930 he wrote &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot;, which never made it to the West End because when his family, who were familiar with the play, attended the shows, they read out the lines of the characters in bored and dreary voices just before the actors themselves spoke. As a result, the play was reduced to chaos.

Subsequent West End plays were &quot;Escort&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Blind Goddess&quot; (1947), the latter adapted into a film of the same title by Gainsborough Pictures the following year.

==Retirement and death==
Hastings retired from most of his work as a barrister in 1938, but soon found a way to occupy himself after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Although, at fifty-nine, far past the age at which he could join the armed forces, Hastings wrote to the Secretary of State for War offering his services, and was eventually contacted by Kingsley Wood, the Secretary of State for Air, who offered him a commission in the Royal Air Force as a squadron leader in Administrative and Special Duties Branch, serving with Fighter Command. His commission was dated 25 September 1939. He then started work at RAF Stanmore Park, but found his work &quot;very depressing&quot; – most of the other officers were over thirty years younger than he, and he suffered from continuous bad health. His one major contribution was to create a scheme allowing the purchase of small models of German aircraft, allowing the British forces on the ground an easy way to identify incoming planes and avoiding friendly fire situations. Due to his health he relinquished his commission on 7 December 1939.

In Spring 1940 he was elected Treasurer of the Middle Temple. He participated in only a few cases following his war service. One was a high-profile case in November and December 1946 in which he was engaged by the &quot;Newark Advertiser&quot; in defence of a libel action brought by Harold Laski, who was seeking to clear his name from the newspaper&#x27;s claim that he had called for socialism &quot;even if it means violence&quot;. Cross-examining Laski, the following exchange occurred:

HASTINGS: Are there any privileged in the Socialist Party?

LASKI: Why, indeed, Sir Patrick, when you were a member—

THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: No, Mr. Laski.

HASTINGS: Do not be rude.

Laski&#x27;s counsel later said that he hoped that Hastings would at least have said &quot;Touché&quot;. Laski lost the case, unable to counter the questioning from Hastings which referred to his previous written works. However the stress of the case told on Hastings.

In 1948, Hastings published &quot;The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings&quot;, and the following year published &quot;Cases in Court&quot;, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases. The same year he published &quot;Famous and Infamous Cases&quot;, a book on noted trials through history, such as those at Nuremberg. In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently. On 11 November 1949, he and his wife travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved to start a new life after the end of the Second World War. While there, he suffered a second stroke due to the air pressure, and he never fully recovered. Hastings spent the next two years living in a flat in London, before dying on 26 February 1952 of cerebral thrombosis.

==Personal life==
Hastings married Mary Grundy on 1 June 1906. The couple had two sons, David and Nicholas, and three daughters. David died in the Second World War in the Pacific Theatre, and Nicholas became a farmer in Kenya. One daughter, Barbara, married Nicolas Bentley, a cartoonist.

<text>Concordia is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It is in the northeastern part of the city of Winnipeg.

It is bordered to the south by St. Boniface, to the west by Elmwood, to the north by Rossmere, and to the east by Radisson. The riding was created by redistribution in 1979, and formally came into existence with the provincial election of 1981.

Concordia is an ethnically diverse riding, with 16% of its human population born outside Canada. According to a 1999 census report, 9% of the riding&#x27;s residents are aboriginal, with a further 9% of German background and 7% of Ukrainian background.

Concordia&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,318. The average family income of the riding in 1999 was $39,613, one of the lowest in the province. Thirty-two percent of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low-income, and 21% of its households are single-parent families. The unemployment rate in 1996 was 9.50%.

The riding&#x27;s primary industry in 1999 was manufacturing (18%), followed by services (14%) and the retail trade (14%).

The New Democratic Party has represented Concordia since its creation. Gary Doer was its Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1986, leader of the NDP from 1988, and Premier of Manitoba from 1999; he gave up all three of these positions when he was appointed as Ambassador to the United States in 2009. He had been re-elected in 2003 and 2007 with 77% and 70% of the popular vote. A by-election to succeed Doer was scheduled for March 2, 2010. In the event, Matt Wiebe, who previously worked for Doer as a constituency assistant, retained Concordia for the NDP, and he has continued to represent it since.

<text>Pacific Garden Mission is a homeless shelter which is located in the Near West Side section of Chicago, Illinois, it was founded in 1877 by Colonel George Clarke and his wife, Sarah. Nicknamed &quot;The Old Lighthouse&quot;, it is the largest homeless shelter in Chicago and among the oldest in the city, and, according to the PGM website, &quot;is the oldest continuously operating rescue mission in the country.&quot;

Two people who converted to Christianity as a result of PGM&#x27;s efforts are the famous evangelists Billy Sunday and Mel Trotter.

In 1950, the Mission began production of &quot;Unshackled!&quot;, a radio dramatic series which showcases conversions to Evangelical Christianity. The show, recorded live at PGM, is still in production today and it is translated into seven languages for international distribution.
PGM&#x27;s original location was 386 S. Clark Street. In 1880, the mission moved to 67 E. Van Buren Street, in a location which was formerly known as the Pacific Beer Garden. At that time, the current name of the mission, Pacific Garden Mission, was adopted; However, evangelist D.L. Moody suggested that the name of the former occupant should be kept but the word &quot;Beer&quot; should be dropped from the name.

In 1923, the Mission moved to 646 S. State Street, just south of The Loop, following a shift in the location of Chicago&#x27;s Skid Row. At that time, the area was known for its hobo jungles and its flophouses.

Beginning in the 1990s and continuing through the 2000s, the population of the neighborhood greatly increased. In response to this situation, the City of Chicago filed suit against the Mission in the early 2000s in order to expand the undersized and outdated facilities of Jones College Prep, a public high school which is located on 606 S. State Street, next to Pacific Garden Mission. In December 2004, the Mission and the city signed an agreement in which the city promised to move to a new location which is located on 1458 South Canal Street, about one mile southwest of its State Street location. PGM&#x27;s State Street building was slated for demolition in order to make room for the Jones expansion. Groundbreaking for the new PGM facility took place on November 16, 2005. The building, which was designed by Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman of Tigerman McCurry Architects, was completed in 2007, and the formal dedication of it occurred on October 13, 2007.

<text>Alternanthera philoxeroides, commonly referred to as alligator weed, is a native species to the temperate regions of South America, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Argentina alone hosts around 27 species that fall within the range of the genus &quot;Alternanthera&quot;. Its geographic range once covered only the Parana River region of South America, but it has since expanded, having been introduced to over 30 countries, such as the United States, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand and many more. This invasive species is believed to have been accidentally introduced to these non-native regions through sediments trapped by, or attached to, tanks and cargo of ships travelling from South America to these various areas.

== Description ==
&quot;Alternanthera philoxeroides&quot; can thrive in both dry and aquatic environments and is characterized by whitish, papery flowers along its short stalks, irregular, or sprawling hollow stems, and simple and opposite leaf pattern sprouting from its nodes. It is also considered a herbaceous plant due to its short-lived shoot system. It produces horizontal stems, otherwise known as stolons, that can sprout up to in length and thanks to its hollow stems, floats easily. This results in large clusters of stem amassing and create dense mats along the surface. Bisexual flowers are small, white, and born on dense, axillary spikes (type of raceme). Presence of a peduncle is a key trait that distinguishes this species from the sessile inflorescences of &quot;Alternanthera sessilis&quot;. While seed production has been observed in its native range, there is currently no record of viable &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; seeds in the introduced range. The weed&#x27;s intricate root system can either allow them to hang free in the water to absorb nutrients or directly penetrate the soil/sediment and pull their nutrients from below.

== As an invasive species ==
&quot;Alternanthera philoxeroides&quot; is considered a major threat to ecosystems because of the adverse effects it poses on both aquatic and terrestrial environments, as well as the negative influence it has on society. The species features on the list of invasive alien species of Union Concern since 2017. This means that import and trade of this species is forbidden in the whole of the European Union.

=== Impacts on vegetation ===
The presence of this invasive species disrupts the natural flow of water due to the dense mats created by its clusters of stems. It out competes the native vegetation for space and solar energy through these dense mats because they form large clusters and limit the amount of light that submerged vegetation receives. These compact clusters of stems also disturb the regular exchange of gases that occurs underneath the surface that directly influences aerobic processes, such as photosynthesis. Aside from driving down the population of native aquatic vegetation, &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; can also influence the growth and yield of crops in pastures and fields. These dense mats can affect the natural flow of water that is used in irrigation systems and as well as affect the quality of the water by increasing the sedimentation present in the water. Both of these factors must remain undisturbed for crops to grow well, and thus to provide a healthy yield for farmers, which will be discussed in the later section on its impacts on society. On top of this, the likelihood of flooding is higher due to the impaired drainage caused by the dense mats, which in turn can also damage crops. This invasive species also has other negative impacts on the environment.

=== Impacts on animals ===
As mentioned, the compact mats formed by this species can drive down the population of native vegetation in the environments it invades. This then becomes a major issue for native herbivores because their food source declines. In addition, the dense mats present a challenge for the native wildlife by acting as a barrier between them and natural water sources. However, even if they can reach the water, they are still at risk because the water quality can be contaminated by the increased sediments. Thus, just as it did with the native vegetation, &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; is also driving down the populations of the native wildlife as well.

=== Impacts on society ===
Dense mats formed by this species influence the natural flow of water, which can impede various recreational activities, such as boating and fishing. The disruption of flow can also have a negative impact on infrastructure when it comes to energy, such as the use of hydro-electric dams to power generators. The dense mats also present suitable ecological conditions that mosquitoes can thrive off of. This is a commensal relationship between mosquitoes and &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; because mosquitoes receive a breeding ground and the plant gains nothing nor loses anything. The increased population of mosquitoes can bring an increased risk of mosquito-borne diseases in humans. Furthermore, the dense mats produced by &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; may not present suitable ecological conditions for native species or humans to thrive off.

== Reproduction and dispersal ==
This invasive plant depends solely on vegetative means to reproduce and disperse itself in the area it has invaded and established its roots. In its native geographic range, the species spreads to through means of producing viable seeds; however, it has been observed within its non-native ranges that it rarely produces viable seeds. To accommodate this, the &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; reproduces through fragmentation; the plant can regenerate itself from small portions of stems or small leaf cuttings. These small fragments of the plant can then be dispersed through human means and natural means; once it is dispersed, the fragments can then find suitable ecological conditions and root themselves and regenerate.

=== Human dispersal ===
In effort to eradicate the species by manual means, such as mulching or pulling them out, if not removed efficiently, small stem fragments can be displaced to new areas. Soil movement caused by earthmoving machinery is another example of how humans influence the dispersal of the plant.

=== Natural dispersal ===
In aquatic environments, the &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; can easily disperse its fragments by being sucked into the path of the waterways. In terrestrial environments, the small fragments of stems and leaf cuttings can be dispersed through the natural movement of soil caused by erosion. Thus, the geographic range of this invasive species can easily be expanded by any means necessary due to its ability to regenerate from practically nothing.

== Methods of control ==
=== Preventive measures ===
Early detection is the best bet to ensure that the invasive species does not successfully colonize a non-native region because of its ability to regenerate and propagate from small portions of its stem or leaf cuttings. However, when that is not possible, the best that can be done is to limit and control the presence of &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; in an area. &quot;Alternanthera philoxeroides&quot; can only establish itself in shallow waters no deeper than , so one method of control is to erect barriers in shallower areas to limit the amount of suitable space the plant has. When it comes to terrestrial environments, overpopulating the area with native species can limit the suitable space available for it. However, this method is only effective before the invasive plant has asserted itself in an area. Lastly, as previously mentioned, this plant is only able to produce viable seeds in its native geographic range and not in the areas it has invaded. Learning why that is - what ecological conditions make it produce only sterile seeds - could be key to developing further preventative measures against it.

=== Biological measures ===
Insects have been released for the biological control of &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot;. The most successful and widely used is &quot;Agasicles hygrophila&quot; commonly called the alligator weed flea beetle; it has been released for biocontrol in Australia, China, Thailand, New Zealand, and the United States. However, their effectiveness is limited due to their inability to survive through temperatures lower than . &quot;Amynothrips andersoni&quot;, the alligator weed thrips, and &quot;Vogtia malloi&quot;, the alligator weed stem borer, have also been released in the United States. These species result in immediate wilting and limit &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; reproduction by colonizing its stems. A variety of chemicals have been shown to be effective in controlling the plant, the most useful of which include glyphosate, triclopyr, fluridone, imazamox, and imazapyr; however, they must constantly be applied to be successful.

===Legality of sale and shipment in the United States===
In 1956 &quot;A. philoxeroides&quot; was banned for sale or shipment in the United States, subject to a fine and/or imprisonment. This law was repealed by HR133 [116th Congress (2019-2020)] on 12/27/2020.

<text>Pittenweem Priory was an Augustinian priory located in the village of Pittenweem, Fife, Scotland. 
==History==
The 6th century religious recluse St Monan is believed to have lived at a monastery at Pittenweem before leaving to take up residence in a small cave at Inverey. Antiquarian Robert Sibbald says that in 1100, Edgar, King of Scotland gave Pittenweem to the Culdees.

Around 1145, Benedictines from Reading Abbey founded the Priory of St. Mary the Virgin on the Isle of May. David I of Scotland granted the monks the manor of Pittenweem, where they erected a priory over the ancient sacred cave associated with Saint Fillan. It was a stopping off point for pilgrims on their way to St Andrews or St. Ethernan&#x27;s shrine on the Isle of May. 

Due to raiding parties from Orkney, the relative isolation of the community, and privations due to the difficulty of securing supplies, in 1288, Reading sold the Isle of May priory to the Bishop of St. Andrews, who gave it the canons of St Andrews Cathedral Priory. With the severing of ties with Reading, Pittenweem became their chief seat. It was less exposed to incursions by the English, nearer to the superior house at St. Andrews, and could be reached without the necessity of a precarious passage by sea. In 1318, the canons on the Isle of May relocated to Pittenweem.
The cave, which is fitted out as a chapel, was rededicated as a place of worship by the Bishop of St. Andrews in 1935.

The present Church of Scotland parish kirk is on the site of the priory church. Much of the fortified east gatehouse of the priory survives (15th century), as does the &#x27;Great House&#x27;, one of Scotland&#x27;s best-preserved late medieval houses, which may have served as living quarters for the prior and monks. It was designated a Category A listed building in 1972.

<doc id="1118934" wikidata="Q1322760" url="?curid=1118934" title="Naval Battle of Hakodate">
<text>The was fought from 4 to 10 May 1869, between the remnants of the Tokugawa shogunate navy, consolidated into the armed forces of the rebel Ezo Republic, and the newly formed Imperial Japanese Navy. It was one of the last stages of Battle of Hakodate during the Boshin War, and occurred near Hakodate in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaidō.

==Ezo Republic forces==
The naval forces of the Ezo Republic were grouped around the warship &quot;Kaiten&quot;. The fleet originally consisted of eight steamships: &quot;Kaiten&quot;, &quot;Banryū&quot;, Japanese gunboat &quot;Chiyoda&quot;, &quot;Chōgei&quot;, &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot;, &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, &quot;Mikaho&quot; and &quot;Shinsoku&quot;.

However, &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; and &quot;Shinsoku&quot; had been lost in a previous engagement in front of Esashi, and &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; had been captured by Imperial forces after suffering damage in bad weather. The loss of these three major units seriously weakened the Ezo Republic side.

==Imperial forces==
For the operation, an Imperial Japanese Navy fleet had been rapidly constituted around the recently acquired ironclad warship &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; (the former Confederacy CSS &quot;Stonewall&quot;), which had been purchased from the United States. Other Imperial ships were &quot;Kasuga&quot;, &quot;Hiryū&quot;, &quot;Teibō&quot; No.1, , and &quot;Mōshun&quot;, which had been supplied by the domains of Saga, Chōshū and Satsuma to the newly formed Meiji government in 1868.

The nascent Imperial government started with a much weaker navy than that of the Ezo Republic, both in terms of vessel strength, unity (most of its ships were borrowed from Western domains), and training. However the loss of two major units on the Ezo side previous to the main action (&quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; and &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;), and most of all, the incorporation of the revolutionary &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; since April 1868 on the Imperial side (a ship originally ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate but withheld by the United States during the main conflict under a policy of neutrality taken by foreign nation and finally delivered to the newly formed government), turned the tables. In addition, the Imperial government received the support of two transportation ships chartered by the United States for the transportation of its troops.

==Combat==

The Imperial fleet supported the deployment of troops on the island of Hokkaidō, destroyed onshore fortifications and attacked the rebel ships. On 4 May &quot;Chiyoda&quot; was captured by Imperial forces after having been abandoned in a grounding and on 7 May &quot;Kaiten&quot; was heavily hit and put out of action. &quot;Banryū&quot; managed to sink the Imperial forces&#x27; &quot;Chōyō&quot;, but &quot;Banryū&quot; later sank in turn because of heavy damage.

The Imperial Japanese Navy won the engagement, ultimately leading to the surrender of the Republic of Ezo at the end of June 1869.
Ships of foreign navies — the British HMS &quot;Pearl&quot; and the French &quot;Coetlogon&quot; — were standing by neutrally during the conflict. The French captain Jules Brunet who had trained the rebels and helped organize their defenses, surrendered on &quot;Coetlogon&quot; on 8 June.

The future Admiral of the fleet Tōgō Heihachirō participated in the battle on the Imperial side as a young third-class officer, onboard &quot;Kasuga&quot;.

<text>Rezzato (Brescian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, Lombardy. It is bounded by the comunes of Brescia, Botticino, Castenedolo, Mazzano and Nuvolera. It is located at the foot of the Alps and a few kilometres from Lake Garda. It is the most populous city east of Brescia.

Officially founded on 12 March 1299, Rezzato has been an important religious and administrative centre since the Middle Ages. The settlement has played a significant role in Italian history, notably during Second Italian War of Independence when the Austrians led by Field Marshal Karl von Urban defeated the Sardinians commanded by Giuseppe Garibaldi in the famous Battle of Treponti (1859). After absorbing the nearby settlement of &quot;Virle Treponti&quot; in 1928, the borough was eventually awarded city status in 2022. During World War II, as many cities in northern Italy, Rezzato suffered extensive damage, leading to post-war rebuilding that significantly shaped its modern appearance.

Thanks to its nearness to the small town of Botticino, Rezzato is commonly considered the town of marble working. The stonecutters from Rezzato have been famous since the 15th century for their creativity and their artistic way of working with Botticino marble. For this reason, Rezzato was chosen by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission as the place to produce some headstones for its military cemeteries.

==History==

===Early history===
Neolithic deposits, including bones of Homo sapiens, have been found in local caves, and artefacts dating to the Bronze Age have been found at Mount Peladolo. The most important prehistorical place in the area was &quot;Ca&#x27; dei Grii&quot;, a cave on the south side of Mount Regogna. During archaeological research from 1954 to 1968, objects of the Neolithic period were discovered. The cave, a refuge for prehistoric men, served also as a temporary home for a few families during the Second World War. It was destroyed in 1969 by an adjacent marble pit.

===Modern era===
The origin of this town&#x27;s name is thought to be the medieval &quot;Regadium&quot;, which meant &quot;royal court&quot;, a term used to designate the area surrounding the city of Brescia. Benedictine monks contributed to the founding of Rezzato by draining the land and digging irrigation canals on the Valverde plain.

Rezzato became a free &quot;comune&quot; on 12 March 1299, when the inhabitants obtained by the bishop of Brescia Berardo Maggi the permission to autonomize the village from the Benedictine monastery of St. Eufemia.

In the 14th century, battles between Guelph and Ghibelline city-states led to domination over Milan and the nearby territory by the powerful Visconti family, backed by the emperor Henry VII. While the western part of Lombardy was taken over by the Sforza family in the 15th century, Brescia became part of the Venetian Republic in 1429. Under Venice, local commerce and crafts prospered, and Rezzato became known for its marble. Stone cutting was the predominant business in Rezzato from the 15th to the early 20th century.

Because of its nearness to the city and its particular climate, many noble families built their holiday houses in Rezzato. The noble Giacomo Chizzola, after his withdrawal from politics, founded in his villa a school for the children of the rich families in Brescia, so that they could learn Latin. It is known that the mathematician Niccolò Tartaglia gave a lesson in Euclide, and Chizzola taught rural economy. This academy was maybe the most ancient agricultural academy in the world.

Some notable people visited and stayed in Rezzato during the 19th century: Napoleone and Garibaldi spent a night in Villa Fenaroli, while the Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli used to come to Rezzato in summer to spend his holidays.

On 15 June 1859, in Rezzato took place the notable Battle of Treponti, one of the battles of the Second War of Independence, fought between Garibaldi and the Austrian Karl von Urban.

The municipal territory took on its current dimensions in 1928, with the addition of the village of Virle Treponti.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Rezzato is located in the northern section of the Po Valley, immediately east of Brescia, at the foot of the Brescian Prealps.

The territory consists of three large morphological macroregions: the flat bight between Monte Maddalena, the hills of Botticino and the Monte Regogna. The hilly system consists of the mountains &quot;Regogna&quot;, &quot;Fieno&quot; (the highest point of the town&#x27;s territory at ) and &quot;Marguzzo&quot;, and two hills called &quot;Peladolo&quot; and &quot;Poggio San Martino&quot;. While the northern part of the territory is hilly, the southern area of the town is flat. The administrative comune covers a total area of .

The hills of the entire area are made up of different types of stones. The first one to be considered is the &quot;&quot;corna&quot; consisting of calcium carbonate and magnesium, which would have formed almost 193 million years ago. This stone is present throughout the basin between Monte Regogna and Monte Marguzzo, including Poggio San Martino. Important studies carried out on Mount Regogna allowed the identification of various fossilized forms of marine life and marine life. The age of the &quot;corso&quot; begins shortly after the &quot;corna&quot; one. This stone is in the lower part of Monte Regogna. Since they are very low parts, time so submerged in the sea, fossil shells of ammonite and sea urchins have been found here. The &quot;medolo&quot;&quot;, which rises on the west side of Monte Regogna, has a much newer formation (178 million years ago) and is a stone made up of limestone marbles. The &quot;medolo&quot; is characteristic of a deep marine environment and therefore even here rivers of fossil shells emerge.

At just from the Garda Lake, it is crossed by the so-called &quot;Naviglio Grande Bresciano&quot;, an ancient canal built in 1253, from which departs a huge system of small canals now mostly covered and still today used for agriculture. Other important canals are the &quot;Rino&quot;, a torrent that coming from the mountains, crosses the historic centre of Virle Treponti and enters the &quot;Naviglio Grande&quot; at the highway of Treponti. Near the mouth of the &quot;Rino&quot;, from the waters of the &quot;Naviglio&quot; the canal &quot;Lupa&quot; flows through the countryside south of Treponti towards Castenedolo. From Botticino descends the torrent &quot;Rino Musia&quot; that crosses part of the northeast wooded area of the town and then enters the city of Brescia.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Rezzato has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Its average annual temperature is : during the day and at night. The warmest months are June, July, and August, with high temperatures from to . The coldest are December, January, and February, with low temperatures from to .

Winter is cold but snowfall is rare; it mainly occurs from December through February. Summer can be sultry when humidity levels are high and peak temperatures can reach . Spring and autumn are generally pleasant, with temperatures ranging between and .

The relative humidity is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes fog, mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become increasingly less frequent in recent years.

Precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year. The driest month is December, while the wettest months are April/May and October/November.

==Demographics==

Rezzato had a population of 13,576 inhabitants as of 31 December 2017.

Since the end of World War II, like other places in Lombardy, Rezzato has been host to two waves of mass migration: the first, workers from within Italy; the second, immigrants from outside the peninsula. These two migrations have corresponded with two different economic phases. The first migration coincided with the economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, a period of extraordinary growth based on classic industry and public works. The second immigration has taken place against the background of a vastly different economy, centred around services, small industry and post-industrial scenarios. The first migration concerned Italians, from the countryside, the mountains and the cities and towns of the South, the East or the other provinces of Lombardy.

==Municipal government==
Rezzato is headed by a mayor (&#x27;) assisted by a legislative body, the &#x27;, and an executive body, the &#x27;. Since 1995, the mayor and members of the &#x27; are directly elected together by resident citizens originally every four then every five years, while from 1945 to 1995 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The &#x27; is chaired by the mayor, who appoints other members, called &#x27;. The offices of the &#x27; are housed in a building usually called the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;, which in this case is seated in the central Piazza Vantini.

This is a list of the mayors of Rezzato since 1945:


==Main sights==

*PInAC, or &quot;Aldo Cibaldi International Gallery of Children&#x27;s Art&quot;, opened officially in 1969 and it&#x27;s the most important museum of the town. Today it holds more than 6,000 works of art in its facility in via Disciplina, the old deconsecrated church of St. Alexander. The building is both a gallery and an open educational centre, with training courses and experimental didactic activities. Drawings by children are still being collected, studied and catalogued today. The gallery works with schools that are interested in promoting children&#x27;s art and the child&#x27;s view of the world. The gallery&#x27;s collections are characterised by a multi-ethnic quality. Workshops for adults are organised with nationally and internationally known artists.
*Villa Avogadro-Fenaroli: this spectacular setting lies between the villages of Ponte and Canale and was home to the noble Avogadros and Fenarolis from Brescia for four centuries. Its north wing dates to the 16th century as well as the balcony overlooking today&#x27;s Scalabrini Street. A 16th-century lodge lies under the cedars of Lebanon near the gardens&#x27; boundaries. Gothic greenhouses were built in 1840, while gardens were rearranged in 1863. The villa is since 2006 a Palace Hotel.
*Bacchus&#x27; Temple: It&#x27;s a small temple built by the Fenarolis in their private park on the top of the St. Peter&#x27;s Hill during the 18th century, closing scenic stairs behind the Villa. In 2001, thieves deprived the temple of its pillars, leaving its dome and trabeation on the ground. The Municipality of Rezzato had it quickly repaired, recovering a symbol of the town&#x27;s identity and history.
*Rodolfo Vantini School: a reason for the success of Brescian neoclassicism is certainly the use of the white Botticino&#x27;s stone. However, very highly skilled carpenters and chisellers were necessary to a style leaning on perfection. This is how Rodolfo Vantini had the idea to set up a school in Rezzato to train these workers. The school opened in 1839 in the Town Hall. Now the school is in the south of the town in a modern building. Vantini was also one of the best architects in Brescia.

==Churches and religious sites==
===Shrine of Our Lady of Valverde===

The shrine was built in a large wooded area in the northern part of the town (the so-called &quot;Valverde&quot;, which means &quot;green valley&quot;). A small chapel called &quot;Rotonda&quot; was built here in 1099, and it is the most ancient sign of the religious faith of the entire zone. The shrine itself was only built between 1601 and 1643, after the archbishop of Milan Carlo Borromeo visited the town and ordered a big church to be built on a rural site in which there were a lot of abandoned and ruined altars built chaotically during the 15th century.

The site is one of the most important in the entire province because of the so-called &quot;miracle of Valverde&quot;, a simultaneous apparition of the Virgin Mary and Christ which allegedly took place in the summer of 1399. Some chronicles tell that a peasant was working in his field when suddenly he saw a man dressed in red, who he recognised as Christ. The man told the peasant to throw the three pieces of bread that he had in his haversack in a little pond nearby. When he arrived at the pond, the peasant saw a lady, the Virgin Mary, who stopped him and ordered him to go back to Christ without throwing the bread into the pond. The peasant went back to Christ and then came back another time to the pond, where the Virgin told him that the three pieces of bread represented war, famine and plague. By throwing only one piece (symbolising plague) into the pond, the Virgin Mary interceded to save the village from war and famine.
According to the chronicles, another apparition occurred on 11 October 1711, when two boys who were picking chestnuts in the nearby wood suddenly saw a great light coming from the pond and a female voice calling them.

To remember the 1399 apparition every year on the last Sunday of July, there is a historical procession of saints from the town centre to the shrine and then to the holy pond where a man disguised as a peasant dives into the water to recover one of the pieces of holy bread.

===St. James church===
With the shrine of Our Lady of Valverde it&#x27;s the most important symbol of the medieval religious faith in Rezzato. The small church was built in 1122 in the middle of the countryside, in the southern part of the town. Placed on the way to Rome, it worked as an inn for pilgrims who were attacked by a community of robbers, settled in the nearby town of Castenedolo. Because of the frequent looting, in 1132 pope Innocent XII ordered the excommunication of those who desecrated the church and its inn.

During the 15th century, a big cascina a corte was built around the church. Until the 1960s more than 300 people lived here and every Sunday a priest came from the town to celebrate a mass.

===St. Peter Franciscan monastery===
Built by the Benedictine monks in 1008 on the ruins of a Roman villa at the top of the St. Peter&#x27;s Hill, it served as the main parish of Rezzato until 1460. In that period it became a Capuchin monastery. Closed by the French in 1798, reopened in 1836 and then reclosed in 1866 by the Italian government, the monastery was definitely reopened by the Franciscan friars in 1869 and also used as a prison during the First World War. It hosts an ancient library.

==Transportation==
The A4 motorway (Turin-Milan-Venice-Trieste) passes south of the town, while Route SS 11, the Padana Superiore road, and Route SS 45bis, the Gardesana Occidentale road, lead directly to Rezzato.

The nearest train station to Rezzato is in Brescia (the train station of Rezzato was active until mid-1990s), on the Milan-Venice railway line. The nearest airport is in Montichiari (8 km).

The town was connected to Brescia, Salò and Lake Garda by a by a tramway from 1887 to 1954 and by a train line from 1897 to 1967.

In the town there are about 7 km of cycling paths. Rezzato is also connected to the Lake Garda by the Rezzato-Vobarno cycling route.

In the second half of 2017, due to the impossibility of an extension of the Brescia Metro to the town, the possibility of a reopening of the local train station is under consideration.

==Education and services==
In Rezzato there are: 
* one public nursery school; 
* four public pre-education schools;
* three public elementary schools;
* one public lower secondary school.

The town is also provided with a vocational institute, hosted in the ancient &quot;Rodolfo Vantini&quot; School (&quot;School of Arts and Professional Instruction&quot;), which offers also a course in marble sculpture.

The central public library of Rezzato is the biggest of the eastern area of the Province and it&#x27;s the center of a system of 22 libraries seated in different municipalities.

Since 1965, the town has a public retirement home and since 1975 there&#x27;s a public building on the Monte Regogna used for daily summer camps for children and old people.

==Environment==

===Recycling===
Since December 2009, the municipality of Rezzato has adopted a kerbside collection system for removing household waste (materials separately collected are: green waste, kitchen waste, paper, plastics, aluminium and glass, diapers, industrial products). The adoption of this new system improved the percentage of recycled waste on total municipal waste production:

<text>is a Japanese singer and musical actress. She is the leader of the Japanese rock band Lovendor. From 2002 to 2013, she was one of the main vocalists of the girl group Morning Musume and participated in other music acts under the Hello! Project name.

==Career==
===2001–2013: Morning Musume===

Tanaka auditioned for a spot in Morning Musume&#x27;s 5th Generation in 2001 and passed, but had to leave the training camp for being under the age limit. She attempted again in 2002 for a position in the 6th Generation and passed along with members Eri Kamei and Sayumi Michishige. She provided the main vocals for the single &quot;Shabondama&quot;. She was featured in two solo versions of &quot;Memory Seishun no Hikari&quot; on a fan club release CD.

In 2003, Tanaka became a member of the sub-unit Aa!, along with Miyabi Natsuyaki and Airi Suzuki, two Hello! Project Kids members. They released one single, &quot;First Kiss&quot;, on October 29, 2003. Later, in 2004, she participated in singing &quot;All for One &amp; One for All!&quot;, a collaboration single released by all Hello! Project artists under the name &quot;H.P. All Stars.&quot; She also sang the coupling track, &quot;Suki ni Naccha Ikenai Hito&quot;, with Suzuki and Megumi Murakami.

On March 28, 2008, Tanaka made her voice acting debut as Kirara, the main character in Sanrio&#x27;s anime &quot;Onegai My Melody Kirara&quot;, the fourth My Melody series. The show premiered on April 6, 2008.

In 2008, Tanaka became the leader of Hello Project&#x27;s new unit High-King.

In 2009–2010 Tanaka voiced the main/title character of the anime series, &quot;Kaitō Reinya&quot;. The character had been modeled on Tanaka. The show began airing on January 8, 2010.

Tanaka graduated from Morning Musume on May 21, 2013, and subsequently concentrated her activities on her rock band Lovendor.

===2013–present: Lovendor and solo activities===

Lovendor was formed in 2012. Originally there were four members: Reina Tanaka, Marina Okada, Yuki Uozumi, Marin Miyazawa.

In June 2019 it was announced that Lovendor would be going on hiatus.

Tanaka has also performed in various musicals and, as of 2018, has been increasing her solo live activities.

==Personal life==
Tanaka was born in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Her brother is seven years younger than her.

On July 15, 2024, she announced her marriage and pregnancy of her first child. On November 18, she gave birth to her daughter.

<text>Nonribosomal peptides (NRP) are a class of peptide secondary metabolites, usually produced by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. Nonribosomal peptides are also found in higher organisms, such as nudibranchs, but are thought to be made by bacteria inside these organisms. While there exist a wide range of peptides that are not synthesized by ribosomes, the term &quot;nonribosomal peptide&quot; typically refers to a very specific set of these as discussed in this article.

Nonribosomal peptides are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, which, unlike the ribosomes, are independent of messenger RNA. Each nonribosomal peptide synthetase can synthesize only one type of peptide. Nonribosomal peptides often have cyclic and/or branched structures, can contain non-proteinogenic amino acids including -amino acids, carry modifications like &quot;N&quot;-methyl and &quot;N&quot;-formyl groups, or are glycosylated, acylated, halogenated, or hydroxylated. Cyclization of amino acids against the peptide &quot;backbone&quot; is often performed, resulting in oxazolines and thiazolines; these can be further oxidized or reduced. On occasion, dehydration is performed on serines, resulting in dehydroalanine. This is just a sampling of the various manipulations and variations that nonribosomal peptides can perform. Nonribosomal peptides are often dimers or trimers of identical sequences chained together or cyclized, or even branched.

Nonribosomal peptides are a very diverse family of natural products with an extremely broad range of biological activities and pharmacological properties. They are often toxins, siderophores, or pigments. Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics, cytostatics, and immunosuppressants are in commercial use.

** victorin – a chlorinated cyclic pentapeptide made by the pathogenic fungus &quot;Cochliobolus victoriae&quot;. Its nonribosomal synthesis has not been established.
== Biosynthesis ==

Nonribosomal peptides are synthesized by one or more specialized nonribosomal peptide-synthetase (NRPS) enzymes. The NRPS genes for a certain peptide are usually organized in one operon in bacteria and in gene clusters in eukaryotes. However the first fungal NRP to be found was ciclosporin. It is synthesized by a single 1.6MDa NRPS. The enzymes are organized in modules that are responsible for the introduction of one additional amino acid. Each module consists of several domains with defined functions, separated by short spacer regions of about 15 amino acids.

The biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides shares characteristics with the polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. Due to these structural and mechanistic similarities, some nonribosomal peptide synthetases contain polyketide synthase modules for the insertion of acetate or propionate-derived subunits into the peptide chain.

Note that as many as 10% percent of bacterial NRPS are not laid out as large modular proteins, but as separate enzymes. Some NRPS modules deviate from the standard domain structure, and some extra domains have been described. There are also NRPS enzymes that serve as a scaffold for other modifications to the substrate to incorporate unusual amino acids.

=== Modules ===

The order of modules and domains of a complete nonribosomal peptide synthetase is as follows:
* &quot;Initiation&quot; or &quot;Starting&quot; module: [F/NMT]-A-PCP-
* &quot;Elongation&quot; or &quot;Extending&quot; modules: -(C/Cy)-[NMT]-A-PCP-[E]-
* &quot;Termination&quot; or &quot;Releasing&quot; module: -(TE/R)

(Order: N-terminus to C-terminus; &quot;[]&quot;: optionally; &quot;()&quot;: alternatively)

=== Domains ===
* F: Formylation (optional)
* A: Adenylation (required in a module)
* PCP: Thiolation and peptide carrier protein with attached 4&#x27;-phospho-pantetheine (required in a module)
* C: Condensation forming the amide bond (required in a module)
* Cy: Cyclization into thiazoline or oxazolines (optional)
* Ox: Oxidation of thiazolines or oxazolines to thiazoles or oxazoles (optional)
* Red: Reduction of thiazolines or oxazolines to thiazolidines or oxazolidines (optional)
* E: Epimerization into D-amino acids (optional)
* NMT: &quot;N&quot;-methylation (optional)
* TE: Termination by a thio-esterase (only found once in a NRPS)
* R: Reduction to terminal aldehyde or alcohol (optional)
* X: Recruits cytochrome P450 enzymes (optional)

=== Starting stage ===
* Loading: The first amino acid is activated with ATP as a mixed acyl-phosphoric acid anhydride with AMP by the A-domain and loaded onto the serine-attached 4&#x27;-phospho-pantethine (4&#x27;PP) sidechain of the PCP-domain catalyzed by the PCP-domain (thiolation).
* Some A domains require interaction with MbtH-like proteins for their activity.
* Sometimes the amino group of the bound amino acid is formylated by an F-domain or methylated by an NMT-domain.

===Elongation stages===
* Loading: Analogous to the starting stage, each module loads its specific amino acid onto its PCP-domain.
* Condensation: The C-domain catalyzes the amide bond formation between the thioester group of the growing peptide chain from the previous module with the amino group of the current module. The extended peptide is now attached to the current PCP-domain.
* Condensation-Cyclization: Sometimes the C-domain is replaced by a Cy-domain, which, in addition to the amide bond formation, catalyzes the reaction of the serine, threonine, or cysteine sidechain with the amide-&quot;N&quot;, thereby forming oxazolidines and thiazolidine, respectively.
* Epimerization: Sometimes an E-domain epimerizes the innermost amino acid of the peptide chain into the D-configuration.
* This cycle is repeated for each elongation module.

=== Termination stage ===
* Termination: The TE-domain (thio-esterase domain) hydrolyzes the completed polypeptide chain from the PCP-domain of the previous module, thereby often forming cyclic amides (lactams) or cyclic esters (lactones).
* Also, the peptide can be released by an R-domain that reduces the thioester bond to terminal aldehyde or alcohol.

===Processing===

The final peptide is often modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acylation, halogenation, or hydroxylation. The responsible enzymes are usually associated to the synthetase complex and their genes are organized in the same operons or gene clusters.

===Priming and deblocking===

To become functional, the 4&#x27;-phospho-pantetheine sidechain of acyl-CoA molecules has to be attached to the PCP-domain by 4&#x27;PP transferases (Priming) and the S-attached acyl group has to be removed by specialized associated thioesterases (TE-II) (Deblocking).

=== Substrate specificities ===

Most domains have a very broad substrate specificity and usually only the A-domain determines which amino acid is incorporated in a module. Ten amino acids that control substrate specificity and can be considered the &#x27;codons&#x27; of nonribosomal peptide synthesis have been identified, and rational protein design has yielded methodologies to computationally switch the specificities of A-domains. The condensation C-domain is also believed to have substrate specificity, especially if located behind an epimerase E-domain-containing module where it functions as a &#x27;filter&#x27; for the epimerized isomer. Computational methods, such as SANDPUMA and NRPSpredictor2, have been developed to predict substrate specificity from DNA or protein sequence data.

=== Mixed with polyketides ===

Due to the similarity with polyketide synthases (PKS), many secondary metabolites are, in fact, fusions of NRPs and polyketides. In essence, this occurs when PK modules follow NRP modules, and vice versa. Although there is high degree of similarity between the Carrier (PCP/ACP) domains of both types of synthetases, the mechanism of condensation is different from a chemical standpoint:
* PKS, carbon-carbon bond formation through Claisen condensation reaction
* NRPs, the C domain catalyzes the amide bond formation between the amino acid it adds to the chain (on the PCP of one module) and the nascent peptide(on the PCP of the next module).

<text>Albert Cabell Ritchie (August 29, 1876 – February 24, 1936) was an American lawyer and politician. A Democrat, he was the 49th governor of Maryland from 1920 to 1935. Ritchie was a conservative who campaigned for, but did not win, the presidential nomination in both 1924 and 1932. As of 2020, Ritchie is the state&#x27;s longest-serving governor, with almost 15 years of service (14 years, 11 months, and 27 days) and a record four terms. Ritchie has the eighth-longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at days.

==Early life and family==
Albert Ritchie was born on August 29, 1876, in Richmond, Virginia, to relatively distinguished parents. His middle name, Cabell, was from his mother&#x27;s family. His father, Albert, had served as a member of the Maryland Constitutional Convention in 1867, as a professor of law at the University of Maryland, as city solicitor of Baltimore, Maryland, and as a judge for the Supreme Bench of Baltimore. His mother, Elizabeth Caskie Cabell, was a granddaughter of William H. Cabell, a governor of Virginia, and great niece of Joseph Cabell, a close associate of Thomas Jefferson.

Ritchie moved to Baltimore with his family shortly after his birth and received his early education from private schools including the Carey School for Boys, which later became known as the Boys&#x27; Latin School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1896, and his law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1898. He entered into practice with the firm of Steele, Semmes, Carey and Bond in 1900, and in 1903 was appointed assistant city solicitor of Baltimore. The same year, he formed his own law practice with Stuart S. Janney. Ritchie continued to serve as solicitor until 1910, and continued to practice law with Janney until 1919. In 1907, Ritchie was appointed as a professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law.

In 1907, Ritchie married Elizabeth Catherine Baker of Catonsville, Maryland. However, in June 1916, Baker filed for divorce under the charge of abandonment, since Ritchie had left her to live with his mother in 1910. He did not challenge her claim, and the divorce was finalized soon thereafter. Ritchie never remarried, nor did he have any children.

==Early political career==

===Public Service Commission===
On July 1, 1910, Ritchie was appointed as people&#x27;s counsel to the Public Service Commission of Baltimore. He garnered much attention for fighting to lower gas and electricity prices for the people of Baltimore that resulted in annual savings of $500,000. Ritchie resigned on February 16, 1913, to return to his law practice, where he took up a case against a local utility company for producing inferior quality gas. The Public Service Commission sided with Ritchie on the issue, and the result was further savings of $200,000 annually for the residents of Baltimore.

===Attorney General of Maryland===
Ritchie&#x27;s actions did not go unnoticed, and he was nominated to be Attorney General of Maryland in 1915, a position he served in from December 20, 1915, to December 20, 1919. In the primary election, Ritchie defeated challenger William Milnes Maloy, who would later challenge him for governor, by 20,000 votes. In the general election, Ritchie defeated his Republican rival, Albert Doub, by 25,000 votes. As attorney general, Ritchie economized the state government by having the state law department assume the legal activities of nearly every department, with the exception of the Public Service Commission, thus eliminating the need for other departments to hire outside legal counsel.

On June 3, 1918, Ritchie took a leave of absence as attorney general to serve on the War Industries Board as general counsel. Established as a result of World War I, the War Industries Board was one of the most influential of all the wartime organizations established by the government. While on the board, Ritchie became a good friend of Bernard Baruch, the chairman of the board, and a man who would later support Ritchie&#x27;s presidential aspirations. The board was dissolved in December 1918, and Ritchie returned to his position as attorney general.

==Governor of Maryland==
During the gubernatorial election of 1919, Ritchie made his interest known and quickly gained support from the state Democrats. He went unopposed on the primary ticket, but the general election proved to be considerably more challenging and proved to be one of the closest elections in state history.

Harry Whinna Nice, the Republican nominee was a close friend and favorite of a notorious and powerful Democratic party boss in Baltimore, John S. &quot;Frank&quot; Kelly. Harry Nice was a frequent caller to &quot;Frank&quot; Kelly&#x27;s headquarters on West Saratoga Street in Baltimore while attending law school. The warm relationship Nice developed with &quot;Boss&quot; Kelly, as he was also known, worked to his advantage and landed him a considerably high appointment following law school, assistant to the state&#x27;s attorney in Baltimore. That was especially surprising since Nice was a Republican in a city predominantly run by Democrats. It is still rumored that Kelly, seeking to confirm and show the Democratic Party leadership, which trying to oust him, that he was still the top Democratic boss in Baltimore, pulled a few strings to get Nice appointed as a sign of just how powerful he was to any would-be political challengers.

The election year of 1919 saw the political winds of fortune blowing strongly in the direction of the GOP in Maryland but nationally as well. Convinced and initially backed by Kelly, Nice resigned as assistant state&#x27;s attorney and cast his hat into the gubernatorial race. However, Nice then made a costly mistake. In speeches during the campaign, Nice promised to clean up the dirty underworld politics of the Democrats and their political bosses and ensure elections were fair and open to everyone. Ballot stuffing, voter fraud, and outright voter intimidation were common, especially in large cities like Baltimore.

The speeches were taken by &quot;Boss&quot; Kelly as a slap to the face, the man he had helped build politically was out condemning him and his business in public. While Kelly was no doubt enraged, he was probably more embarrassed then anything else, as the other Baltimore bosses saw it as weakness believing Kelly had no real control over his candidate, as he had often claimed. In a last-minute decision on election day, &quot;Boss&quot; Kelly, switched his support from his former friend, Harry Nice, to Albert Ritchie and swung just enough votes Ritchie&#x27;s way to give him the narrowest margin of victory in Maryland history. Out of nearly 225,000 votes, Ritchie won with a mere 165 votes to spare, defeating Republican challenger Harry W. Nice 112,240 to 112,075. Across the state, however, Republicans gained control of the legislature and succeeded in electing Republicans to both mayor of Baltimore and attorney general.

;First term
Ritchie proved one of the last strong upholders of states&#x27; rights, gaining national prominence in 1922 with his stand against President Harding during the Western Maryland coal strike, and his strenuous opposition to the Volstead Act (prohibition). His legislative program was in three main areas: state government reorganization, increased representation for Baltimore, and reduction in the number of elections. The first governor of Maryland reelected since the Civil War, Ritchie loomed as a serious contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1924 until the compromise on John W. Davis. Ritchie worked hard for the ticket, and at home achieved reforms in mental health, shellfish conservation, and law enforcement while continuing to fight federal encroachments on state prerogatives.

During Ritchie&#x27;s first term, he worked to improve the public education system by establishing standards for the counties and by distributing wealth from the richer to the poorer counties. His actions were successful, and the Maryland educational system emerged as one of the best in the nation. Ritchie also invested considerable funds in expanding and improving the highways of the state, resulting in Maryland emerging as having one of the best highway systems in the country.

Ritchie was a strong opponent of the Eighteenth Amendment, which established prohibition, and was a staunch advocate of states&#x27; rights. He also gained national attention for his refusal to cooperate with the administrations of Presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. During a miner&#x27;s strike in 1922, Ritchie refused a request from Harding to break up the strike by force, instead choosing a diplomatic alternative. The situation was peacefully defused.

===Second term===
For the first time in state history, Ritchie was nominated for a second term as governor in 1923. He was again unopposed in the primary, but during the general election faced Alexander Armstrong, his successor as attorney general. In a campaign which focused on his accomplishments as governor and defiance of the Eighteenth Amendment, Ritchie easily defeated Armstrong by a plurality of 43,000 votes. His second term began on January 9, 1924, but because of an election law that changed the date of election that passed during Ritchie&#x27;s first term, his second term only lasted three years.

===Third term===
Ritchie had announced early on his intentions to seek a third term as governor, but, unlike in 1919 and 1923, he faced opposition in the primary elections of 1926. Ritchie&#x27;s old rival, William Milnes Maloy, whom Ritchie had defeated in 1915 for nomination for attorney general, again chose to challenge Ritchie for the Democratic nomination. Ritchie was easily nominated, having defeated Maloy by 81,500 votes. During the general election, Ritchie was challenged by Republican Addison Mullikin, who made issue of the Conowingo Dam construction project which he felt Ritchie had handled poorly. Nevertheless, Ritchie won the election by over 60,000 votes and won Baltimore and 14 of 23 counties in the state. He was sworn in for his third term on January 12, 1927.

During his third term, Ritchie further worked with the state transportation system, calling for the construction of new highways and bridges, and for the improvement of the railways. Ritchie also pursued one of the earliest programs of conservation of the Chesapeake Bay, enacting strict game and fishing legislation. A corruption scandal emerged towards the end of Ritchie&#x27;s third term involving employees of the State Roads Commission who were accused of embezzling $376,000. After a long investigation, and after Ritchie established a committee to investigate the allegations, those responsible were arrested. The Governor and the State Roads Commission were absolved from blame.

===Fourth term===
Ritchie was nominated for a fourth term in September 1930. State Senator David McIntosh of Baltimore County had initially announced his candidacy for governor, but withdrew upon Ritchie&#x27;s announcement that he would seek renomination. Ritchie secured renomination easily, and faced William Broening, the Republican mayor of Baltimore, during the general election. Ritchie won re-election by one of the largest majorities up to that time, having won by 66,770 votes.

By early 1931 unemployment stood at 19.2%. Governor Ritchie was a stalwart opponent of federal intervention in local affairs, and continued to urge programs sponsored by the business community itself. Social welfare agencies based on state support expanded services as much as possible, but beyond pushing ahead with all feasible public works projects the state did little. Baltimore established a Commission on Employment Stabilization but found work for only one-fifth of the job-seekers. Baltimore relief agencies were soon overwhelmed and the election of Mayor Howard W. Jackson, although bringing about municipal loans to the Citizens&#x27; Emergency Relief Committee, showed that local aid was simply inadequate. Ritchie agreed to issue state bonds to aid Baltimore, but would not borrow from President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s new Reconstruction Finance Corporation until mid-1933, and his luxury tax program met stiff opposition from county representatives opposed to new tobacco taxes. Originally planned for $8 million, the Baltimore bond issue had to be $12 million as the state economy floundered. Only reluctantly was federal assistance finally accepted.

==Presidential campaign of 1932==

Ritchie had established a national reputation during the convention of 1924 and was admired by the conservative wing of the Democratic party as a &quot;wet&quot; (in favor of repealing Prohibition) who appealed to the urban vote. At the 1932 Democratic National Convention, he was convinced that Roosevelt would not get the necessary two-thirds majority to win the nomination. Ritchie was considered a major contender for the Presidency in 1932.

Ritchie was well received, but Roosevelt was nominated on the fourth ballot. Ritchie and several others including Governor George Dern were considered for the vice presidential nomination, which ultimately went to John Nance Garner.
==Defeated for fifth term, and legacy==
Ritchie&#x27;s popularity as governor reached its peak during the early years of his fourth term, but gradually began to wane because of growing jealousy within the party as a result of his long tenure as governor, and because of two lynchings that had occurred on the Eastern Shore of Maryland (those of Matthew Williams in Salisbury in 1931, and George Armwood in Princess Anne in 1933).

Although Ritchie&#x27;s model, business-like government had thoroughly modernized Maryland, he had forged a Democratic party organization which his opponents attacked as a &quot;machine&quot;. In 1934 Ritchie was seeking his fifth term and &quot;Ritchie forever&quot; seemed a real possibility. However, Dr. Charles Conley cut heavily into the Ritchie vote in the Democratic primary, and Republican opponent Harry W. Nice attacked the governor&#x27;s relief efforts and promised to be &quot;more new Dealish&quot; than the conservative Ritchie. While a Ritchie victory was widely predicted, when Nice took all but three counties the postmortems agreed that the governor&#x27;s longevity &quot;and the cry of &#x27;too long&#x27;&quot; was the fundamental explanation, but the opposition of Baltimore blacks and labor also seemed significant. In the general election, Nice defeated Ritchie 253,813 to 247,644.

Throughout his 15 years as governor, Ritchie called the legislature into special session several times, including once in 1920 to vote on women&#x27;s suffrage in Maryland, and again in 1933 to ratify the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1933.

He was also a member of Civitan International.

==Personal life and death==
Ritchie had been married, but his work got in the way of his marriage, and he ended up getting divorced.

After his defeat, Ritchie returned to his law practice in Baltimore. On February 24, 1936, Ritchie died suddenly and unexpectedly of what was determined to be a cerebral hemorrhage. After a private funeral, Ritchie&#x27;s body was placed on public display for several days and was viewed by thousands of mourners. He was interred at Greenmount Cemetery, where he was buried next to his father and mother.

<doc id="1118968" wikidata="Q1503522" url="?curid=1118968" title="Multi Router Traffic Grapher">
<text>The Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is free software for monitoring and measuring the traffic load on network links. It allows the user to see traffic load on a network over time in graphical form.

It was originally developed by Tobias Oetiker and Dave Rand to monitor router traffic, but has developed into a tool that can create graphs and statistics for almost anything.

MRTG is written in Perl and can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS and NetWare.

==How it works==
===SNMP===
MRTG uses the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to send requests with two object identifiers (OIDs) to a device. The device, which must be SNMP-enabled, will have a management information base (MIB) to look up the OIDs specified. After collecting the information it will send back the raw data encapsulated in an SNMP protocol. MRTG records this data in a log on the client along with previously recorded data for the device. The software then creates an HTML document from the logs, containing a list of graphs detailing traffic for the selected devices in the server.

===Script output===
Alternatively, MRTG can be configured to run a script or command, and parse its output for counter values. The MRTG website contains a large library of external scripts to enable monitoring of SQL database statistics, firewall rules, CPU fan RPMs, or virtually any integer-value data.

==Features==

* Measures two values (I for Input, O for Output) per target.
* Gets its data via an SNMP agent, or through the output of a command line.
* Typically collects data every five minutes (it can be configured to collect data less frequently).
* Creates an HTML page per target that features four graphs (GIF or PNG images).
* Results are plotted vs time into day, week, month and year graphs, with the I plotted as a full green area, and the O as a blue line.
* Automatically scales the Y axis of the graphs to show the most detail.
* Adds calculated Max, Average and Current values for both I and O to the target&#x27;s HTML page.
* Can also send warning emails if targets have values above a certain threshold.

<doc id="1118971" wikidata="Q4188466" url="?curid=1118971" title="Hang fire">
<text>Hang fire is an unexpected delay between the triggering of a firearm and the ignition of the propellant. This failure was common in firearm actions that relied on open primer pans, due to the poor or inconsistent quality of the powder, although modern firearms are also susceptible. The delay is usually too brief to be noticed, but can be several seconds. A hangfire should be suspected whenever a firearm fails to fire, but has not clearly malfunctioned.

==Ignition sequence==
The ignition train of modern firearms begins with detonation of a small quantity of impact-sensitive primary explosive in a primer in cartridge firearms or in a percussion cap in muzzleloaders. The energy released by this detonation is intended to ignite the propellant charge of gunpowder or smokeless powder. Primary explosives may deteriorate with age so they release less energy; and propellants damaged by moisture or lubricants may require more energy to ignite. These conditions may either delay the ignition sequence or cause a misfire if ignition is completely prevented. While a normal ignition sequence causes the firearm to discharge immediately when the trigger is pulled, a hang fire will be perceived as a click when the hammer falls followed by the loud noise of suddenly expanding gas when the firearm discharges. The delay may be only a fraction of a second or may last for several seconds.

==Procedures==
A shooter may interpret the initial click of the hammer fall as an unloaded firearm or a misfire. A hang fire delay of a fraction of a second may be fast enough to correct that misinterpretation before the shooter takes inappropriate action to reload; but a longer delay may allow the shooter time to move the firearm so the muzzle points in a different (and possibly unsafe) direction, or to open the action so the cartridge is no longer confined. Unexpected discharge after the firearm has been moved from the firing position will damage whatever is in front of the muzzle, and large-caliber firearms may injure the shooter during recoil. Unexpected discharge as the action is being opened will allow a portion of the propellant energy to burst the cartridge case and possibly damage the firearm with a risk of injury to the shooter and nearby persons.

The correct procedure is to keep the firearm pointed at a safe target for thirty seconds, then remove the round. This rule is usually not followed in combat, where being without a working firearm is the bigger risk.

==Legacy==
The phrase &quot;to hang fire&quot; has come to mean a delay in progressing, for example from one task to another.

<doc id="1118975" wikidata="Q942678" url="?curid=1118975" title="Samuel J. Randall">
<text>Samuel Jackson Randall (October 10, 1828April 13, 1890) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who represented the Queen Village, Society Hill, and Northern Liberties neighborhoods of Philadelphia from 1863 to 1890 and served as the 44th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881. He was a contender for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States in 1880 and 1884.

Born in Philadelphia to a family active in Whig politics, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs&#x27; demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council and then to the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 1st district. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was re-elected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power.

Randall&#x27;s support for smaller, less centralized government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats lost control of the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for president in 1880 and 1884. Randall&#x27;s support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as chair of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.

==Early life and family==

Randall was born on October 10, 1828, in Philadelphia, the eldest son of Josiah and Ann Worrell Randall. Three younger brothers soon followed: William, Robert, and Henry. Josiah Randall was a leading Philadelphia lawyer who had served in the state legislature in the 1820s. Randall&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Matthew Randall, was a judge on the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas and county prothonotary in that city in the early 19th century. His maternal grandfather, Joseph Worrell, was also a prominent citizen, active in politics for the Democratic Party during Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s presidency. Josiah Randall was a Whig in politics, but drifted into the Democratic fold after the Whig Party dissolved in the 1850s.

When Randall was born, the family lived at Seventh and Walnut Streets in what is now Center City Philadelphia. Randall was educated at the University Academy, a school affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania. On completing school at age 17, he did not follow his father into the law, but instead took a job as a bookkeeper with a local silk merchant. Shortly thereafter, he started a coal delivery business and, at age 21, became a partner in a scrap iron business named Earp and Randall.

Two years later, in 1851, Randall married Fannie Agnes Ward, the daughter of Aaron and Mary Watson Ward of Sing Sing, New York. Randall&#x27;s new father-in-law was a major general in the New York militia and had served in Congress as a Jacksonian Democrat for several terms between 1825 and 1843. Randall and Fannie went on to have three children: Ann, Susan, and Samuel Josiah.

==Local politics and military service==

In 1851, Randall assisted his father in the election campaign for a local judge. The judge, a Whig, was elected despite considerable opposition from a candidate of the nativist American Party (commonly called the &quot;Know-Nothing Party&quot;). The strength of this group, combined with the Whigs&#x27; declining fortunes, led Samuel Randall to call himself an &quot;American Whig&quot; when he ran for Philadelphia Common Council the following year. He was elected, holding office for four one-year terms from 1852 to 1856. The period was one of significant change in Philadelphia&#x27;s governance, as all of Philadelphia County&#x27;s townships and boroughs were consolidated into one city in 1854.
As the Whig Party fell apart, Randall and his family became Democrats. Josiah Randall was friendly with James Buchanan, a Pennsylvania Democrat then serving as the United States&#x27; envoy in Great Britain. Both Randall and his father attended the Democratic National Convention in 1856 to work for Buchanan&#x27;s nomination for president, which was successful. When, in 1858, a vacancy occurred in Randall&#x27;s state Senate district, he ran for election (as a Democrat) for the remainder of the term, and was elected. Still only 30 years old, Randall had risen rapidly in politics. Much of his term in the state Senate was spent dealing with the incorporation of street railway companies, which he believed would benefit his district. Randall also supported legislation to reduce the power of banks, a policy that he would continue to advocate for his entire political career. In 1860, he ran for election to a full term in the state Senate while his brother Robert ran for a seat in the state House of Representatives. Ignoring their father&#x27;s advice that it meant &quot;too much Randall on the ticket&quot;, both brothers were unsuccessful.

In 1861, the Civil War began as eleven Southern states seceded from the Union to form the Confederate States of America. Randall joined the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry in May of that year as a private. The unit was stationed in central Pennsylvania and eastern Virginia during Randall&#x27;s 90-day enlistment, but saw no action during that time. In 1863, he re-joined the unit, this time being elected captain. The First Troop was sent back to central Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg campaign that summer, when Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania. He served as provost marshal at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in the days before the battle there, and had the same role at Columbia, Pennsylvania during the battle, but did not see combat. As historian Albert V. House explained, &quot;[h]is military career was respectable, but far from arduous, most of his duties being routine reconnoitering which seldom led him under fire.&quot;
==House of Representatives==
===Election to the House===

In 1862, before rejoining his cavalry unit, Randall was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1st congressional district.
The city had been gerrymandered by a Republican legislature to create four solidly Republican districts, with the result that as many Democrats as possible were lumped into the 1st district. Gaining the Democratic nomination was, thus, tantamount to election; Randall defeated former mayor Richard Vaux for their party&#x27;s endorsement and won easily over his Republican opponent, Edward G. Webb. He won with the help of William &quot;Squire&quot; McMullen, the Democratic boss of the fourth ward, who would remain a lifelong Randall ally.

Under the congressional calendar of the 1860s, members of the 38th United States Congress, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863. Randall arrived that month, after being discharged from his cavalry unit, to join a Congress dominated by Republicans. As a member of the minority, Randall had little opportunity to author legislation, but quickly became known as a hard-working and conscientious member. James G. Blaine, a Republican also first elected in 1862, later characterized Randall as &quot;a strong partisan, with many elements of leadership. He... never neglects his public duties, and never forgets the interests of the Democratic Party.&quot;

Randall was known as a friend to the manufacturers in his district, especially as it concerned protective tariffs. Despite being in the minority, Randall spoke often in defense of his constituents&#x27; interests. As House described him,
 With his party continually in the minority, Randall gained experience in the functioning of the House, but his tenure left little evidence in the statute book. He attracted little attention, but kept his constituents happy and was repeatedly reelected.

===War and Reconstruction===

When the 38th Congress convened in December 1863, the Civil War was approaching its end. Randall was a War Democrat, sometimes siding with his Republican colleagues to support measures in pursuit of victory over the Confederates. When a bill was proposed to allow President Abraham Lincoln to promote Ulysses S. Grant to lieutenant general, Randall voted in favor, unlike most in his party. He voted with the majority of Democrats, however, to oppose allowing black men to serve in the Union Army.

When it came to political plans for the post-war nation, he was strictly opposed to most Republican-proposed measures. Republicans proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865, which would abolish slavery, and Randall spoke against it. Claiming opposition to slavery, Randall said his objections stemmed instead from a belief that the amendment was &quot;a beginning of changes in the Constitution and the forerunner of usurpation&quot;. After Andrew Johnson became president following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Randall came to support Johnson&#x27;s policies for Reconstruction of the defeated South, which were more lenient than those of the Republican majority in Congress. In 1867, the Republicans proposed requiring an ironclad oath from all Southerners wishing to vote, hold office, or practice law in federal courts, making them swear they had never borne arms against the United States. Randall led a 16-hour filibuster against the measure; in spite of his efforts, it passed.

Randall began to gain prominence in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens&#x27;s military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough to prevent it from being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.

As impeachment proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall became one of his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches in favor of the president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.

===Financial legislation===

With Grant, a Republican, elected president in 1868, and the 41st Congress as Republican-dominated as its immediate predecessors, Randall faced several more years in the minority. He served on the Banking and Currency Committee and began to focus on financial matters, resuming his long-standing policy against the power of banks. This placed Randall in the growing fight over the nature of the nation&#x27;s currency—those who favored the gold-backed currency were called &quot;hard money&quot; supporters, while the policy of encouraging inflation through coining silver or issuing dollars backed by government bonds (&quot;greenbacks&quot;) was known as &quot;soft money&quot;. Although he believed in a gold-backed dollar, Randall was friendly to greenbacks; in general, he favored allowing the amount of currency to remain constant, while replacing bank-issued dollar bills with greenbacks. He also believed the federal government should sell its bonds directly to the public, rather than selling them only to large banks, which then re-sold them at a profit. He was unsuccessful in convincing the Republican majority to adopt any of these measures.

Randall worked with Republicans to shift the source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He believed the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall&#x27;s district, as it made foreign products more expensive.

Tariff legislation generally found favor with Randall, which put him more often in alliance with Republicans than Democrats. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, Randall worked to raise tariffs on a wide variety of imported goods. Even so, he sometimes differed with the Republicans when he believed the tariff proposed was too high; biographer Alfred V. House describes Randall&#x27;s attitude as supporting &quot;higher tariff rates... largely because he believed that the benefits of such high rates were passed on to the labor population.&quot; In 1870, he opposed the pig iron tariff as too high, against the wishes of fellow Pennsylvanian William &quot;Pig Iron&quot; Kelley. Randall called his version of protectionism &quot;incidental protection&quot;: he believed tariffs should be high enough to support the cost of running the government, but applied only to those industries that needed tariff protection to survive foreign competition.

===Appropriations and investigations===

While the Democrats were in the minority, Randall spent much of his time scrutinizing the Republicans&#x27; appropriations bills. During the Grant administration, he questioned thousands of items in the appropriation bills, often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments&#x27; needs. He proposed a bill that would end the practice, common at the time, of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated, then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation; the legislation passed and became law. The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through at the end of a session with little debate. Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads, he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations.

Investigating appropriations led Randall to focus on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad&#x27;s principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares that they had been allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall&#x27;s role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).

Randall was caught on the wrong side of one scandal in 1873 when Congress passed a retroactive pay increase. On the last day of the term, the 42nd Congress voted to raise its members&#x27; pay by 50%, including a raise made retroactive to the beginning of the term. Randall voted for the pay raise, and against the amendment that would have removed the retroactive provision. The law, later known as the Salary Grab Act, provoked outrage across the country. Randall defended the Act, saying that an increased salary would &quot;put members of Congress beyond temptation&quot; and reduce fraud. Seeing the unpopularity of the Salary Grab, the incoming 43rd Congress repealed it almost immediately, with Randall voting for repeal.

===Rise to prominence===

Democrats remained in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase the power of the federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.

Randall stood against this measure, as he had against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of consensus delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority for the first time since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner&#x27;s civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall&#x27;s filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.

As Democrats took control of the House in 1875, Randall was considered among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction&#x27;s vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace&#x27;s clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.

In the meantime, the divisions in the state party proved ruinous for Randall&#x27;s chances at the Speaker&#x27;s chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused on reducing the government&#x27;s spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr&#x27;s health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused to take his place as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again.

==Speaker of the House==
===Hayes and Tilden===


After Kerr&#x27;s death, Randall was the consensus choice of the Democratic caucus, and was elected to the Speakership when Congress returned to Washington on December 2, 1876. He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time, as the presidential election had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner. The Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden of New York, had 184 electoral votes, just shy of the 185 needed for victory. Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, had 163; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt.

Randall spent early December in conference with Tilden while committees examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, with each of the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.

Randall supported the idea, believing it the best solution to an intractable problem. The bill passed, providing for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member was to be a Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice, but he upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority. Randall nevertheless favored the compromise, even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote (the Speaker usually does not vote). The commission met and awarded all the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote.

Democrats were outraged, and many demanded that they filibuster the final count in the House. Randall did not commit, but permitted the House to take recesses several times, delaying the decision. As the March4 inauguration day approached, leaders of both parties met at Wormley&#x27;s Hotel in Washington to negotiate a compromise. Republicans promised that, in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the commission&#x27;s decision, Hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from the South and accept the election of Democratic governments in the remaining &quot;unredeemed&quot; states there. The Democratic leadership, including Randall, agreed and the filibuster ended.

===Monetary disputes===

Randall returned to Washington in March 1877 at the start of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this would effectively return the United States to the gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.

The attempt at repeal did not end the controversy over silver. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill that would require the United States to buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. Randall allowed the bill to come to the floor for an up-or-down vote during a special session in November 1877: the result was its passage by a vote of 163 to 34 (with 94 members absent). The pro-silver idea cut across party lines, and William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa, led the effort in the Senate. Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus, the seignorage, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government&#x27;s credit, not private citizens. President Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode the veto, and the Bland–Allison Act became law.

===Potter committee===

As the 1880 presidential elections approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed of the presidency in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought an investigation into the 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party&#x27;s candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee&#x27;s reach to the two disputed states.

Randall left no doubt about his sympathies when he assigned members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes&#x27;s enemies from both parties. The committee&#x27;s investigation had the opposite of the Democrats&#x27; intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden&#x27;s nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.

===Reelected Speaker===
As the 46th Congress convened in 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, but they still held a plurality of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, most of whom were affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall&#x27;s fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners&#x27; names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.

===Civil rights and the army===

Randall&#x27;s determination to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats&#x27; desire to reduce federal power in their home states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall&#x27;s role in the process was limited, but the Democrats&#x27; failure to force Hayes&#x27;s acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.

===1880 presidential election===

As the 1880 elections approached, Randall had two goals: to increase his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace&#x27;s faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, as well as to wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies&#x27; enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia&#x27;s 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.

When the state convention gathered in April 1880, Randall was confident of victory, but soon found that the Wallace faction outnumbered his. Wallace&#x27;s majority scrambled the party&#x27;s organization in Philadelphia and, although some Randall supporters received seats, the majority owed allegiance to the senator. Despite the defeat, Randall pressed on for Tilden, both in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. As rumors circulated that Tilden&#x27;s health would keep him from running again, Randall remained a loyal Tilden man up to the national convention that June. After the first ballot, the New York delegation released a letter from Tilden in which he withdrew from consideration. Randall hoped for the ex-Tilden delegates to rally to him. Many did so, and Randall surged to second place on the second ballot, but the momentum had shifted to another candidate, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. Nearly all the delegates shifted to Hancock, and he was nominated.

Randall believed he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless in support of his party&#x27;s nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, in keeping with the customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield&#x27;s victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall&#x27;s time as Speaker was at an end.

==Later House service==

===Tariffs===

When Randall returned to Washington in 1881 to begin his term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield&#x27;s assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had returned to his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president&#x27;s plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support it. The bill that emerged from the Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March 3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.

The Democrats recaptured the House after the 1882 elections, but the incoming majority in the 48th Congress was divided on tariffs, with Randall&#x27;s protectionist faction in the minority. The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker more in line with their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall&#x27;s attempt to canvass the incoming representatives was further hampered by an attack of the gout. In the end, John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53.

Carlisle selected William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to lead the Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall to take charge of Appropriations. Morrison&#x27;s committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall&#x27;s Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison&#x27;s tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.

===1884 presidential election===

As in 1880, the contest for the Democratic nomination for president in 1884 began under the shadow of Tilden. Declining health forced Tilden&#x27;s withdrawal by June 1884, and Randall felt free to pursue his own chance at the presidency. He gathered some of the Pennsylvania delegates to his cause, but by the time the convention assembled in July, most of the former Tilden adherents had gathered around New York governor Grover Cleveland. Early in the convention, Randall met with Daniel Manning, Cleveland&#x27;s campaign manager, and soon thereafter Randall&#x27;s delegates were instructed to cast their votes for Cleveland. As his biographer, House, wrote, the &quot;actual bargain struck between Randall and Manning is not known, but... events would seem to show that Randall was promised control of federal patronage in Pennsylvania.&quot;

Cleveland&#x27;s campaign made extensive use of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats did not want to lower the tariff so much that they would lose their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.

===Resisting tariff reform===

As the 49th Congress gathered in 1885, Cleveland&#x27;s position on the tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison&#x27;s attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall&#x27;s protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall&#x27;s protectionists, but Republicans and the rest of the Democratic caucus rejected it.

===Declining influence===

The tariff fight continued into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control of the House, with a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter&#x27;s defeat for reelection, and was as much in favor of tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills&#x27;s bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.

Mills&#x27;s and Cleveland&#x27;s defeat on the tariff bill could be considered a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker&#x27;s protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland&#x27;s veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland&#x27;s veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland&#x27;s veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.

===Death===

Randall&#x27;s positions on tariffs and pensions had made him, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;a practical Republican&quot; by 1888. Voting with the opposing party so frequently was an effective tactic, as he faced only token Republican opposition for reelection that year. Randall&#x27;s health continued to decline. When the new congress began in 1889, he received special permission to be sworn into office from his bed, where he was confined. The new Speaker, Republican Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, appointed Randall to the Rules and Appropriations committees, but he had no impact during that term.

On April 13, 1890, Randall died of colon cancer in his Washington home. He had recently joined the First Presbyterian Church in the capital, and his funeral was held there. He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Elected every two years from 1862 to 1888, Randall was the only prominent Democrat continuously on the national scene between those years. In an obituary, the Bulletin of the American Iron and Steel Association described the congressman who had consistently protected their industry: &quot;Not a great scholar, nor a great orator, nor a great writer, Samuel J. Randall was nevertheless a man of sterling common sense, quick perceptions, great courage, broad views and extraordinary capacity for work.&quot; His longtime Republican adversary and rival Thomas Brackett Reed wrote of Randall that &quot;there have been few men with a will more like iron or a courage more unfaltering.&quot;

The only scholarly works on his life are a master&#x27;s thesis by Sidney I. Pomerantz, written in 1932, and a doctoral dissertation by Albert V. House, from 1934; both are unpublished. His papers were collected by the University of Pennsylvania library in the 1950s and he has been the subject of several journal articles (many by House), but awaits a full scholarly biography.

<doc id="1118977" wikidata="Q7174053" url="?curid=1118977" title="Peter Fox (Canadian politician)">
<text>Peter Fox (May 31, 1921 – July 3, 1989) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1966 to 1986. From 1971 to 1977, he served as Speaker of the legislature.

The son of George Fox and Maria Mildovan, Fox was born in Yugoslavia shortly after that country&#x27;s creation, and moved to Canada with his parents at a young age. He was educated at the University of Manitoba, and worked as a stationary engineer. Fox served with the Canadian Forces in Europe during World War II, and was subsequently a member of the Royal Canadian Legion and the &quot;Winnipeg and Canada German Club&quot;. He was actively involved in the labour movement, was a vice-president of the Winnipeg and District Labour Council during the 1960s. Fox returned to his job at Canada Packers after the war. In 1948, he married Nancy Grant.

Fox was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1966, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent James Mills by 836 votes in the east-end Winnipeg riding of Kildonan (he had previously defeated Russell Doern to win his party&#x27;s nomination). Along with most other members of the NDP caucus, he supported Edward Schreyer&#x27;s bid to become party leader in 1968–69.

The NDP scored an upset victory in the provincial election of 1969, and Fox was easily returned in Kildonan. He was appointed Speaker of the Legislature on August 7, 1971, and retained the position until the NDP were defeated in the 1977 election. He was re-elected without difficulty in the 1973 election, but faced a surprisingly strong challenge from PC candidate James Hanson in 1977.

Following Schreyer&#x27;s resignation as party leader in 1979, Fox was one of eight NDP MLAs who supported the election of Sidney Green as interim leader. He does not appear to have been a strong supporter of Howard Pawley, Schreyer&#x27;s successor, but unlike Green and some others did not leave the party during the 1980s.

Following electoral redistribution, Fox was re-elected in the new riding of Concordia in the 1981 provincial election. He was not appointed to cabinet, and did not seek re-election in the 1986 provincial election. In late 1986, he was appointed Vice-Chair of the Highways and Transportation Department Licence Suspension Board. He served as a director on Winnipeg&#x27;s Industrial Development Board and served on the board for Winnipeg Hydro.

He died in Winnipeg at the age of 68.

<text>Emerson Columbus Harrington (March 26, 1864December 15, 1945) was an American politician who served as the 48th Governor of Maryland from 1916 to 1920. He also served as Comptroller of the Maryland Treasury from 1912 to 1916.

==Early life, career, and family==
Emerson Harrington was born to John E. Harrington and Elizabeth Thompson Harrington in the town of Madison in Dorchester County, Maryland. He attended the public schools of Madison until he turned 16, at which point he went on to attend St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1884 and a master&#x27;s degree two years later. He became a tutor at the college after graduation, and, as a result of an instructor falling ill, was elected to be an assistant professor. Before assuming his new position, he accepted a position as principal at the Cambridge Academy, a position he served in for 12 years. He married Gertrude Johnson on June 27, 1893, and with her had three children, Emerson C. Jr., Mary Virginia, and William Johnson.

==State political career==
After studying law, Harrington was admitted to the bar in 1898 and commenced practice soon thereafter. He worked with Frederick Douglass St. Clair Sr., an African American. In 1899, he was elected as the State&#x27;s Attorney for Dorchester County, and served in that position until his election defeat in 1903. As state&#x27;s attorney, Harrington gained a reputation as a hard-liner, and was an aggressive prosecutor. This, along with party conflict, contributed to his defeat.

Harrington resumed the practice of law in Cambridge, Maryland in 1903. In 1910, he was appointed as Insurance Commissioner, a position he served in until he was elected Comptroller of Maryland in 1911. During the election, he defeated Republican challenger John A. Cunningham by 7,800 votes. Harrington was re-elected two years later, defeating challenger Oliver Metzerott by a comfortable margin.

==Governor of Maryland==
In 1915, Harrington chose to run for Governor of Maryland. During the heated Democratic primary, Harrington&#x27;s opponent Blair Lee I accused him of poorly managing the state&#x27;s finances during his tenure as Comptroller, and Baltimore Mayor John H. Preston spoke ill of Harrington regarding his handling of a dispute between Baltimore City and Pennsylvania Railroad. The disputes were settled, however, and Harrington won the Democratic primary. During the general election, Harrington defeated Republican Ovington E. Weller by 3,181 votes and was sworn in as governor on January 12, 1916.

As governor, one of Harrington&#x27;s primary initiatives was to establish a ferry service between the Eastern Shore and Annapolis. The Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company began service in June 1919, and the first ferry was named after the governor. During World War I, Harrington established the Council of Defense, which assisted in the establishment of armories throughout the state, including at the Maryland Agricultural College. The council also lobbied for the creation of a military base, which later became Fort George G. Meade.

Regarding social issues of his era, Harrington&#x27;s views on women&#x27;s suffrage and prohibition caused surprise to many Marylanders. In a state that was widely considered to be &quot;wet&quot;, or in favor of legal alcohol, Harrington caused a great deal of upheaval when he announced his support of prohibition, citing concerns for the common welfare. He also surprised his constituents with his support of the proposal to grant voting rights to women, even though he was believed to be against such an initiative. He allowed the execution of John Snowden to proceed despite controversy. Snowden was pardoned posthumously due to inconsistencies in the case. Harrington met with a &quot;colored&quot; girl and her mother during a debate over the death penalty imposed on her alleged attacker.

Harrington&#x27;s term as governor ended on January 14, 1920, and afterwards he returned to his law practice. He remained active in politics, but was unsuccessful in an election for judge of the First Judicial Circuit in 1926, and was again unsuccessful in an election for the First Congressional District of Maryland. 

Harrington served as President of the People&#x27;s Loan, Savings and Deposit Bank of Cambridge, Maryland, and also as the President of the President of the Annapolis-Claiborne Ferry Company he had helped establish as governor. He held the position until operations were taken over by the state.

He died at his home in December 1945 from a short illness and was buried in the cemetery of the Christ Episcopal Church in Cambridge, Maryland.

<text>Edward Oliver LeBlanc (3 October 1923 – 29 October 2004) was a Dominican politician who served as the chief minister from January 1961 to 1 March 1967 and as the first premier from 1 March 1967 to 27 July 1974. Born in Vieille Case, a village in the north of the island, LeBlanc attended the local school and studied agriculture at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad. He worked in the civil service and became a member of the Dominica Trade Union. An early member of the Dominica Labour Party (DLP), he served as a representative in the country&#x27;s Legislative Council representing the constituency of Portsmouth between 1957 and 1958, and as a representative of Dominica in the Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation upon its foundation in 1958. LeBlanc left the federation in 1960 to run for election to the national legislature.

In the 1961 general election, LeBlanc was elected to the constituency of Roseau South and was sworn in as the chief minister and minister of finance. He was dedicated to representing the working class, particularly developing the nation&#x27;s infrastructure, education and culture. He worked to develop Dominica&#x27;s roads system and championed the native dance bélé, the Kwéyòl language and the country&#x27;s national day. On 1 March 1967, Dominica was granted associated statehood and LeBlanc became the first premier. The DLP began to face challenges from the newly established Dominica Freedom Party and the growing youth and Rastafarian movements. In the 1970 general election, LeBlanc was challenged by three of his ministers, Nicholson Ducreay, W. S. Stevens and Mabel Moir James, but he formed a new party for the election, the LeBlanc Labour Party and succeeded in winning eight of the eleven seats in the legislature.

LeBlanc resigned as premier on 27 July 1974 and was replaced by his deputy premier Patrick John. He was a delegate at the Constitutional Conference in May 1977 but otherwise retired from public life, returning to his hometown in Vieille Case. LeBlanc was honoured with the Dominica Award of Honour in 1976 and he has been described as &quot;father of the nation&quot;.

== Early life ==
LeBlanc was born on 3 October 1923 in Vieille Case, a village on the north coast of Dominica. Growing up in a rural environment, where the village was not connected to the rest of the island by roads, significantly shaped his political leanings. Later in life, LeBlanc would often speak about his own informal education, which led to his contempt for those he considered intellectuals. He attended the local government school but when he applied for a scholarship for university, he was rejected for lacking a secondary school education. LeBlanc studied agriculture at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture (now part of the University of the West Indies) in Trinidad, graduating in 1944. In 1948, he received a London matriculated certificate. He joined the civil service in Dominica, working as an agricultural instructor, and often travelled through the rural portions of the island. A member of the Dominica Trade Union (DTU), he later began working for the Dominica Banana Growers Association and was elected to the local town council. In 1949, he married his wife Ethel and the couple had five children: Ewart, Erin, Einstar, Earlsworth and Eustace.

== Political career ==
LeBlanc joined the Dominica Labour Party (DLP) in 1957, which had been established on 24 May 1955 by the trade unionist Emmanuel Christopher Loblack and the writer Phyllis Shand Allfrey. He was elected to the Legislative Council in the 1957 general election to represent the constituency of Portsmouth, beating R. B. Douglas with 46.9% of the vote. Douglas was a powerful adversary, as a businessman who controlled trade between Portsmouth and the capital in Roseau, but LeBlanc captured public interest due to his charisma and for campaigning in patois. Despite LeBlanc&#x27;s success, the DLP suffered many losses in its first election, including Allfrey&#x27;s loss to Elkin Henry.

When Dominica joined the nascent West Indies Federation the following year, LeBlanc resigned from the legislative council and ran in the March 1958 federal elections to represent Dominica in the federation&#x27;s legislative body, the Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation. He was elected alongside Allfrey, with both DLP candidates receiving the most votes in the election. The elections were a Labour landslide, largely because the country&#x27;s middle class saw no future in the federation and, believing it would soon collapse, did not field a strong candidate to oppose them. The federation – composed of ten member states, including Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and the former members of the Windward Islands – was intended to strength relationships in the region and was considered by some politicians to be a step towards independence. Based in Trinidad, the Federal House of Representatives was led by a small majority by the West Indian Federal Labour Party, with which the DLP had allied itself. The union was short-lived and the federation dissolved in 1962 when Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago both decided to leave.

LeBlanc returned to Dominica in 1960 after resigning from the federal parliament. Ahead of the 1961 general election, Allfrey challenged LeBlanc for leadership of the DLP on the basis of their ideological split; LeBlanc pushed for independence from the British Empire and increased separation from the DTU, while Allfrey preferred changes within the existing colonial structure. LeBlanc won the leadership and expelled Allfrey and, later, Loblack from the party in 1964. In the election on 17 January 1961, he won one of the eleven seats in the legislature, defeating Frank Baron to represent the Roseau South constituency. The DLP was challenged in the election by the Dominica United People&#x27;s Party (DUPP), which had been founded by Baron and R. H. Lockhart the same year. The DLP won 47.5% of the vote and 7 seats in the legislature, with the DUPP winning 25.6% of the vote and 4 seats. This was the party&#x27;s first major electoral victory and LeBlanc was sworn in as the chief minister and minister of finance. He was the first person of his background – being described as the &quot;little boy from the country&quot; – to have become the head of government for the country.

=== Chief minister (1961–1967) ===
Following the election, LeBlanc and his allies shifted the focus of the DLP to suit the issues that he had campaigned for – the party moved away from its role as the political arm of the DTU and coloniel politics to become a working class party that was open to middle class intellectuals. While the DLP under Allfrey and Loblack had a socialist lean which continued under LeBlanc, he felt that they had not gone far enough. LeBlanc was committed to achieving independence from Britain and to helping poor workers, whom he called &quot;little men&quot;, a catchphrase that still remains in Dominican politics. He had a strong relationship with the working class and black communities, who felt represented in government for the first time, although his focus on rural citizens was frequently contrasted with his contempt for those that he considered elite, notably those from Roseau who had historically held political power, which were often described by the DLP as the &quot;mulatto gros bourg&quot;. LeBlanc was described by the writer Selwyn Ryan as &quot;a radical populist who sought to govern Dominica on behalf of the black masses. He was a man of the people and a leader to whom the masses and the petit bourgs had ready access and who could speak their language&quot;. One of his first acts as chief minister was to insist that local people should be invited to state functions, rather than British expatriates.

As chief minister, LeBlanc was focused on infrastructure, education and national pride. One significant accomplishment was expanding the nation&#x27;s roads system, which benefited the agricultural industry. LeBlanc was often frustrated by leading a country still under colonial British rule. During the early 1960s, he was focused on infrastructure development, as much of the island was still unconnected by roads but the colonial administrators refused to pay to build any major roads as they claimed not to have the funds, although they would build feeder roads. In response, LeBlanc established a system to divide the roads that he wanted constructed into sections and request funds from the British government to construct each section separately. Using this strategy, he succeeded in building a road to connect the coastal villages to the ports in Roseau and Portsmouth. The LeBlanc government mandated a primary school education for local children and constructed the Dominica Grammar School, which included a technical training programme, Portsmouth Secondary School and Clifton Dupigny Technical College. It established a National Providence Fund, to provide pensions, funded affordable housing in Canefield and helped to re-vitalise village councils.

LeBlanc retained his working-class roots as chief minister and refused to wear a suit jacket and tie, used by middle class Dominicans to distinguish themselves from those of a lower class, to state functions or other formal events. Despite the criticism that he faced for this decision, it led to a change in social norms and the typical formal wear on the island became a loose white shirt described as an &quot;Afro-Jacket&quot;. The use of patois in a formal setting was also discouraged, with many middle class Dominicans pretending not to understand it and schools forbidding it to be taught. LeBlanc was a strong champion of the Kwéyòl language, the local Creole dialect, and often used it in his campaign meetings. Through these efforts, it became an important part of the nation&#x27;s cultural heritage, being used in the country&#x27;s motto and spoken on the national radio station. This focus on cultural nationalism was crucial to LeBlanc&#x27;s legacy. He commissioned the magazine &quot;Dies Dominica&quot; and a work titled &quot;Aspects of Dominican History&quot;. LeBlanc helped to promote the country&#x27;s national day as a cultural festival, with dance, music and art contests, and encouraged the rivival of the native dance bélé and funded the choral singers Siffleur Montagne.

In the 1966 general election, the DUPP were soundly defeated by the DLP, retaining only one seat in the legislature, and following the resignation of Baron, the party dissolved. The DLP was essentially without an opposition party between 1961 and 1968. Even middle class voters, who had previously opposed the party, began to support the DLP after 1965. There was a popular tale in Dominica during LeBlanc&#x27;s time in power that he could run a broomstick as a DLP candidate and still win the election.

=== Premiership (1967–1974) ===

After the dissolution of the West Indies Federation, talks began between various Windward and Leeward Islands to establish a new federation, the &quot;Little Eight&quot;. The discussions carried on for four years, with LeBlanc expressing that the new federation &quot;would preserve democracy in the area&quot;, but no results ever materialised and Dominica was ultimately left to determine its own constitutional change. In April 1966, London hosted the Windward Islands Constitutional Conference, which established a plan for the British to grant Dominica associated statehood. On 1 March 1967, the Dominica Constitutional Order 1967 came into force and under the new structure, a governor would act as the executive, advised by a cabinet comprising a premier and government ministers serving in the House of Assembly. Under this new structure, LeBlanc became the first premier. This arrangement meant that Dominica had control over its own internal politics and policies, while Britain would handle the country&#x27;s foreign affairs and national defense. LeBlanc often expressed his dissatisfaction with this arrangement, believing that Dominica should be given the same independence as Grenada, which would expand the country&#x27;s national government and grant it a seat at the United Nations General Assembly.

The DLP received its first challenge since the dissolution of the DUPP in 1968, when a speech criticising the government for supposed communist policies was reported in the &quot;Dominica Herald&quot;. A group of newspaper editors, including Allfrey of the &quot;Dominica Star&quot;, Stanley Boyd of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and Edward Scobie of the &quot;Herald&quot;, increased their criticism of a government that faced no significant political challenge. The government, led by LeBlanc, reacted by passing legislation intended to restrict media criticism, the Seditious and Undesirable Publications Act, which was nicknamed the &quot;Shut-Your-Mouth Bill&quot;. These editors, led by the barrister Eugenia Charles, founded a group called the Freedom Fighters, composed of upper-class merchants and professionals. The Freedom Fighters held rallies and infiltrated the House of Assembly to disrupt debates on the legislation but despite these efforts, the act was passed. A petition to repeal the act received over 3,000 signatures and led to a rally on 23 September 1968, where LeBlanc was said to have stated, &quot;We are here to rule and rule we will&quot;. Although the act was not repealed, the law was never enforced and several leaders of the Freedom Fighters, including Charles, Allfrey and Loblack, joined to form a new political party, the Dominica Freedom Party (DFP), to contest the 1970 general election.

The 1970 elections were the first under Dominica&#x27;s new political system. Aside from facing a challenge from the new DFP, LeBlanc was confronted by dissent within his own party. Ahead of the election on 26 October 1970, LeBlanc was challenged by three of his ministers – Nicholson Ducreay, W. S. Stevens and Mabel Moir James – who intended to remove LeBlanc from the DLP on the basis that he was an autocrat. Speaking on this issue, LeBlanc said &quot;he cannot involve the Opposition because in the British tradition, which Dominica follows, Edward Heath does not send Harold Wilson to negotiate issues which Heath&#x27;s Government is involved in.&quot; Patrick L. Baker suggested that part of their concern was that Ronald Armour was gaining too much influence over LeBlanc, while Imaobong Umoren wrote that their challenge was influenced by LeBlanc&#x27;s nationalism and opposition to foreign investment. In response to this challenge, LeBlanc established the LeBlanc Labour Party only days before the election and won eight of the eleven seats in the legislature, with the DLP retaining one seat and the DFP picking up two seats. LeBlanc was elected to the north-western constituency with 1,537 votes.

The country&#x27;s close links with Guyana, particularly the People&#x27;s National Congress led by the prime minister Forbes Burnham, began to gather notice. LeBlanc was committed to strengthening Dominica&#x27;s connections with other countries in the region, including hosting the Expo 1969 Trade Fair. In 1971, LeBlanc met with leaders of Guyana and other Caribbean states and was the first to sign the Grenada Declaration on 25 July 1972, which was intended to strength relationships in the region, but it was politically controversial in Dominica. That same year, the DFP won the local Roseau elections and the LeBlanc government reacted by introducing the Roseau Town Council (Dissolution and Interim Commissioner) Bill to replace the town council with a commissioner. A demonstration led by the Freedom Fighters and Louis Benoit of the Waterfront and Allied Workers&#x27; Union occupied the House of Assembly, drawing a response from the Dominica Defense Force (a successor to the Dominica Volunteer Force founded by LeBlanc).

In 1973, there began to be another split in the country&#x27;s government, exacerbated by the growing youth and Rastafarian movements. A radio announcer, Daniel Cauderion, was transferred to a desk job due to his negative comments about the LeBlanc government. In response, the country&#x27;s civil service, led by the Civil Service Association, went on strike. The country declared a state of emergency, which would involve police brutality against civilians. During this time, LeBlanc&#x27;s deputy premier Armour resigned on 13 July 1973 and was subsequently blamed for the circumstances leading to the state of emergency. These movements, led by the Dreads and the Four Corner Boys, only continued to grow more influential as the Movement for a New Dominica gained power. Violence continued into 1974, including between police and civilians at the 1974 Carnival celebrations in Grand Bay. LeBlanc&#x27;s deputy premier Patrick John gained prominence in the party for his radio appearances calling for an aggressive response.

LeBlanc stepped down as the DLP leader in July 1974. He then resigned his position as premier and his seat in the House of Assembly by sending a letter of resignation to the governor Louis Cools-Lartigue two weeks later, on 27 July 1974. John, who had won a party convention to replace LeBlanc as party leader, was sworn in as premier two days later. There are several theories as to why LeBlanc decided to resign, including that he was influenced by the economic or political position in the country, as the 1970s oil crisis impacted finances and traction of the youth and Rastafarian movements, or that he was impacted by colonial politics.

== Death and legacy ==

LeBlanc returned to Vieille Case after resigning from government. He was a delegate at the Constitutional Conference in May 1977 but after the conference, he left public life. LeBlanc was honoured with the Dominica Award of Honour in 1976. He died in Vieille Case on 29 October 2004 at the age of 81. The West Coast Road, connecting Portsmouth and Roseau, was renamed the Edward Oliver Leblanc Highway in 2012.

Since his death, LeBlanc has been described as &quot;father of the nation&quot; and he has been honoured in his country as a hero, gaining the prefix &quot;papa&quot; and &quot;uncle&quot; before his name. His legacy has been associated with his work in the 1960s to improve national infrastructure and for standing for &quot;the little man&quot; and supporting the country&#x27;s working class by improving education opportunities and encouraging a strong national culture. He has been criticised for his attitude as head of government, which has been described as divisive, and for leaving behind a legacy of &quot;victimhood&quot;.

<text>&quot;Death and What Comes Next&quot; is a fantasy short story by British writer Terry Pratchett, part of his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It tells the story of a discussion between Death and a philosopher, in which the philosopher attempts to use the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to argue that death is not a certainty.

The story was written in 2002 for the now-defunct online puzzle game &quot;TimeHunt&quot; and the text contains a hidden word puzzle, also devised by Pratchett, which provided a codeword for the game.

Like &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot;, another of his short stories, Pratchett allowed it to be put on the L-Space Web.

<doc id="1118991" wikidata="Q648130" url="?curid=1118991" title="Phillips Lee Goldsborough">
<text>Phillips Lee Goldsborough I (August 6, 1865October 22, 1946), was an American Republican politician who was the 47th Governor of Maryland from 1912 to 1916 and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1929 to 1935. He was also Comptroller of the Maryland Treasury from 1898 to 1900. To date, he is the last Republican to serve as Comptroller of Maryland.

==Early life and career==
Goldsborough was born in Princess Anne, Maryland and was educated in public and private schools, including Episcopal High School. While working as a clerk for the United States Navy, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1886, commencing practice in Cambridge, Maryland soon thereafter. He also held an interest in banking. In 1893 he married Mary Ellen Showell (c. 1865 – 1930) and they had two sons: Brice W. Goldsborough and Phillips Lee Goldsborough II.

In 1891 and in 1895, Goldsborough was elected state&#x27;s attorney for Dorchester County, Maryland. In 1897, he was elected to the position of comptroller of the treasury of Maryland, but was defeated for reelection in 1899 by Dr. Joshua W. Hering. , he is the last Republican to have served as Maryland Comptroller.

He was appointed collector of internal revenue for the district of Maryland in 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt and later by President William Howard Taft.

==Governor of Maryland==
Goldsborough built a large base of support in the state, which encouraged him to run for Governor of Maryland in 1911. He defeated Democratic challenger Arthur Pue Gorman Jr., becoming only the second Republican governor in state history up to that time. Goldsborough won in part due to the support of African Americans, with the disenfranchising Digges Amendment being concurrently defeated.

Goldsborough&#x27;s tenure as governor achieved education reform, including the appointment of school boards and teacher certification. It was also during his tenure that the state purchased Maryland Agricultural College, now the University of Maryland, College Park.

==United States Senate==
Goldsborough sought the Republican nomination for the Class I U.S. Senate seat from Maryland in 1916, but was defeated in the Republican primary by Joseph I. France. He left politics afterwards and resumed his law practice in Cambridge, and also became president of the National Union Bank.

When Republican Herbert Hoover was elected President of the United States, Goldsborough again sought the same senate seat in Maryland. He was elected to the United States Senate in the election of 1928, defeating incumbent William Cabell Bruce.

==Later career and death==
In 1934, he was not a candidate for re-election to the senate, but instead ran again for Governor of Maryland. He lost in the Republican primary to Harry W. Nice, who went on to win the general election.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed Goldsborough to the director&#x27;s board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1935. He served in that position until he died in 1946 in Baltimore, Maryland, and is buried in the old churchyard of Christ Episcopal Church of his hometown of Cambridge.

He served in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from Ohio from 1877 to 1885 and from 1905 to 1911. From 1881 to 1883 he was Speaker of the House.

==Early life==
Keifer was born in Clark County, Ohio. He attended school at Antioch College then returned to his family&#x27;s farm. While working as a farmer he devoted his spare time to studying law. He began his law practice in Springfield, Ohio, on January 12, 1858.

==Civil War==
Keifer enlisted in the 3rd Ohio Infantry, a three-months regiment, being appointed major. He served in western Virginia fighting in the battles of Rich Mountain and Cheat Mountain and afterward was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the regiment. When his term expired, he joined the 110th Ohio Infantry and became its colonel. He served in the Eastern Theater leading his regiment at the second battle of Winchester. While the Union army was soundly defeated and most of it surrendered, Keifer&#x27;s regiment was able to avoid capture. Following the battle of Gettysburg, Keifer was assigned to brigade command in the III Corps and fought at the battle of Wapping Heights. After Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army had retreated to safety in Virginia, Keifer and his regiment were dispatched to New York City to help suppress the draft riots.

Keifer returned to the Army of the Potomac in time for the Overland Campaign. He was wounded in the arm at the battle of the Wilderness, putting him out of action for a time. When he did return to active duty he was placed in command of the 2nd Brigade in James B. Ricketts&#x27;s 3rd Division of the VI Corps. He led his brigade at the battles of Winchester and Fisher&#x27;s Hill. During the battle of Cedar Creek, VI Corps commander Horatio G. Wright temporarily commanded the Army of the Shenandoah and Ricketts temporarily in command of the corps. This put Keifer in command of the 3rd Division in Ricketts&#x27;s absence. When Philip H. Sheridan heroically returned to command the army in the midst of the battle, returning Wright to corps command, Ricketts had already been wounded, leaving Keifer in command of the division for the rest of the battle. For his service during the Shenandoah Valley Campaign, on December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Keifer for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from October 19, 1864, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.

When the VI Corps returned to the Army of the Potomac General Truman Seymour was placed in command of the 3rd Division and Keifer returned to command the 2nd Brigade, taking part in the breakthrough at Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign. Keifer was breveted as a major general, to rank from April 9, 1865, in recognition of his contributions to the campaign.

==Political career==
Following the Civil War, Keifer returned to Springfield and resumed his law practice. From 1873 until his death, he served as a trustee of Antioch College. In 1876 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention and the next year went to Congress. From 1881 to 1883 during the 47th United States Congress, Keifer served as the 47th Speaker of the House of Representatives.

During his early House years, Keifer was a member of the congressional &quot;Stalwart&quot; faction of the Republican Party led by New York senator Roscoe Conkling.

In 1881, Keifer sparred with Maine colleague Thomas Brackett Reed for the position of U.S. House Speaker. He was selected by intraparty colleagues on the 16th ballot, and proclaimed upon mounting the Speaker&#x27;s rostrum that he would try:
He proved a disappointment as Speaker, his deficiencies in knowledge, judgment, and personality prompting &quot;The Nation&quot; to comment that he was &quot;more successful than any of his predecessors in displeasing the majority of the House.&quot;

==Spanish–American War==
During the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley appointed Keifer major general of volunteers on June 9, 1898. He commanded the 7th Army Corps and the American forces that marched into Havana after Spanish forces withdrew on Jan. 1, 1899.

==Return to politics==
After returning to private life on May 12, 1899, he published &quot;Slavery and Four Years of War&quot;, in 1900. The book was both a commentary on the history of slavery in the United States as well as an autobiography of his experiences during the Civil War. He served as the first commander in chief of the United Spanish War Veterans from 1900 to 1901 and in 1903 and 1904 as the Ohio commander of the Loyal Legion. 

He again ran and was elected to Congress and served from March 4, 1905 – March 3, 1911.

==Later life==
After his political career, Keifer again resumed his law practice and served as the president of the Lagonda National Bank in Springfield, Ohio.

== Death and burial ==
He died April 22, 1932, at the age of 96 in Springfield, and is buried in Springfield&#x27;s Ferncliff Cemetery.

<doc id="1119008" wikidata="Q431736" url="?curid=1119008" title="Edwin Warfield">
<text>Edwin Warfield (May 7, 1848March 31, 1920) was an American politician and a member of the United States Democratic Party, and the 45th Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1904 to 1908. From 1902 to 1903, he served as president general of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

== Early life ==
Edwin Warfield was born to Albert G. Warfield and Margaret Gassaway Warfield at the &quot;Oakdale&quot; plantation in Howard County, Maryland. He received early education at the public schools of Howard County and at St. Timothy&#x27;s Hall (formerly an Episcopal Church institution, now known as St. Timothy&#x27;s School) in Catonsville, Maryland, a &quot;streetcar suburb&quot; southwest of Baltimore. In 1877, he became a professor at Maryland&#x27;s Agricultural College.

Although Maryland was a Union State, many families were southern sympathizers, and two of Warfield&#x27;s brothers served in the Confederate States Army. Gassaway Watkins Warfield died at Camp Chase, while Albert G Warfield Jr. survived the conflict. After the abolition of slavery in the United States, Warfield returned home frequently to help run his family&#x27;s estate. He also spent time as a teacher in the county schools, and studied for admission to the bar in his spare time. In 1888, Warfield founded &quot;The Daily Record&quot; as a newspaper covering finance, commerce, business, and court matters or legal proceedings. The publication continued into the 21st century, along with a corresponding &quot;Warfield&#x27;s&quot; magazine published from the 1980s through the 1990s.

Through his father&#x27;s line, he was a third cousin to the Duchess of Windsor (originally named/née Bessie Wallis Warfield, later Wallis Warfield Simpson of Baltimore), wife of the abdicated king of the United Kingdom, King Edward VIII, later Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor. Warfield&#x27;s lineage also allowed him membership into the Sons of the American Revolution, where he served as 8th President General from 1902 until 1903.

== Political career ==
In 1874, Warfield was appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of Register of Wills for Howard County. He was elected to a full six-year term the following year, and served until 1881. He was appointed to the Maryland Senate following the resignation of Arthur Pue Gorman to accept a higher office, was re-elected in 1883, and served as President of the Maryland State Senate during the 1886 session. While in the Senate, Warfield began his own law practice in Ellicott City, Maryland, and purchased the &quot;Ellicott City Times&quot;, where he served as editor from 1882 to 1886.

During the 1884 Presidential election, Warfield made significant contributions to the campaign of the 22nd (and later also 24th) President Grover Cleveland in Maryland. Cleveland would become the first Democratic president to be elected since before the Civil War. Following the election, Cleveland appointed Warfield to serve as Surveyor of the Port of Baltimore beginning April 5, 1885. Warfield served in that position until May 1, 1890, after the Republicans returned to power. In 1890, Warfield married Emma Nicodemus, with whom he had three daughters and one son.

In 1890, after his removal from the position of Surveyor, Warfield founded the Fidelity and Deposit Company, where he served as president until his death. He was chosen as a delegate to the 1896 Democratic National Convention, but otherwise remained out of politics for nearly a decade.

In September 1903, Warfield served as the main speaker and orator for the ceremonies dedicating the Lt. Col. William H. Watson (1808–1846) Monument.

== Governor of Maryland ==

Warfield chose to run for Governor of Maryland in 1899, but lost the Democratic nomination after he was opposed by influential Maryland politicians, including Arthur Pue Gorman, a powerful U.S. Senator who was allied to the interests of &quot;old pols&quot; in Baltimore City. Though it was apparent that the party bosses did not hold him in favor, he again sought the nomination in 1903, openly discouraging African Americans&#x27; ability to vote. He was successfully nominated by the party, and defeated his Republican opponent, Stevenson A. Williams, by over 12,600 votes. He was inaugurated as the 45th Governor of Maryland on January 13, 1904.

The most significant event of his tenure as Governor came when Arthur Pue Gorman, who had opposed Warfield&#x27;s election, proposed the &quot;Poe Amendment&quot; to the Maryland State Constitution of 1867, which would have disenfranchised most black voters in the state. The bill easily passed the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, but Warfield refused to support the proposed amendment and delayed placing it before the voters. While Warfield was in favor of some of the amendment&#x27;s provisions (such as denying the vote to the less-educated black voters of the state) he feared it would eventually lead to greater levels of disenfranchisement which could threaten all voters in the state. The proposed amendment was put before voters in a 1904 referendum and was defeated by 30,000 votes, a defeat to the crypto-segregationists in the party in which Warfield played a major role. Warfield&#x27;s actions in this affair further alienated him from the Democratic machine in Maryland, which was openly hostile towards him by the time he left office.

As Governor, Warfield supported the establishment of direct voting by popular election for U.S. Senators, in contrast to that time&#x27;s processes of election via each state&#x27;s legislative body. He argued this before the General Assembly in 1906, and direct election of senators was eventually codified into national law with the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his time as Governor, Warfield also authorized and approved of an official state Flag of Maryland, representing a reunited State of Maryland following the division of the Civil War. This was further supported by the Maryland National Guard flying the reinvigorated Maryland flag.

Another historical &quot;final act&quot; for Wakefield&#x27;s term as Governor was the success of a long search and process by the United States&#x27; then-Ambassador to France to discover the whereabouts of an American naval hero&#x27;s burial site in Paris, and to oversee the return of the body of American Revolutionary War Captain John Paul Jones to a specially-prepared marble crypt at the U. S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Warfield left office in January 1908.

== Later life and legacy ==
After his tenure as governor, Warfield returned to his previous activities. He became president of the Fidelity Trust Company with Baltimore Sun Publisher Van Lear Black. He served on the board of the Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company until his death. In addition to retaining his presidency at the Fidelity and Deposit Company, he was a prominent member of the Maryland Club and served as president of the Maryland Historical Society. Warfield was proud of his family&#x27;s Confederate legacy, representing Maryland in reunions and events like the 1911 Southern Commercial Congress in Atlanta.

Warfield&#x27;s health began to deteriorate in late 1919, and he was confined to his home in Baltimore during the last few months of his life. He died there, and was interred in his family burial ground at &quot;Cherry Grove&quot; in Howard County.

Warfield was eulogized by &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; not as a man of definitive accomplishments, but one who stood up to the Democratic machine, supported the public interest, and transformed the office of the governor into a modern institution responsible to the public, rather than the political party.

On September 23, 1948, Edwin Warfield Jr. commemorated a memorial at the Howard County Courthouse to honor Confederate soldiers from Howard County.

In Columbia, Maryland, Governor Warfield is remembered with a street named for him, Governor Warfield Parkway. In 1914, a dredge named the &quot;Gov. Warfield&quot; helped to dig the Cape Cod Canal in Massachusetts.

<text>James Gordon Carr (October 11, 1951 – December 12, 2022) was a Canadian politician, cabinet minister, journalist, and professional oboist. A member of the Liberal Party, he served as the member of Parliament for Winnipeg South Centre from 2015 until his death on December 12, 2022. Carr died days after his Private Members Bill, Bill C-235, &quot;An Act respecting the building of a green economy in the Prairies,&quot; passed the House and went to the Senate. He last served as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, until his resignation on September 29, 2022.

Carr previously served as the Minister of Natural Resources from 2015 to 2018 and Minister of International Trade Diversification from 2018 to 2019. He left Cabinet in 2019 after being diagnosed with cancer, but soon after was named the Special Representative for the Prairies. In 2021, he returned to Cabinet to concurrently serve as a Minister without Portfolio and the Special Representative for the Prairies. He previously was a member of the Manitoba Legislature from 1988 to 1992 for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

==Biography==
Carr was born on October 11, 1951, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of Esther (Golden) and David Carr. He graduated from University of Winnipeg Collegiate, and played the oboe for the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra from ages 16 to 21. Carr was awarded a Canada Council arts grant to study for a year under Marc Lifschey, who was then the primary oboist for the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. While he was there, he unsuccessfully auditioned for first oboist at the Los Angeles Philharmonic. After returning to Winnipeg, Carr gave up music as a career, and did not play the oboe again until picking it up again for political fundraising events.

Carr started his post-secondary education at the University of British Columbia, but transferred to McGill University because his interest in politics was piqued by the Parti Québécois victory in the 1976 Quebec general election. Carr graduated from McGill in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with a joint honours in history and political science.

After graduation, Carr worked in Winnipeg as a staffer on the Manitoba government&#x27;s cultural policy review, and worked as a journalist in the early 1980s. On June 3, 1969, Carr and four other Young Liberals joined the New Democratic Party of Manitoba so as to support Sidney Green&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to lead the party. He later returned to the Liberals. Before entering public life, he was also executive director of the Manitoba Arts Council.

===Provincial politics===
Carr first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1986, losing to Progressive Conservative leader Gary Filmon in the upscale west Winnipeg riding of Tuxedo. He ran again in the provincial election of 1988 during a period of increased support for the provincial Liberals, and scored a surprisingly strong victory in the riding of Fort Rouge, defeating NDP cabinet minister Roland Penner by over 2,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government after this election, and Carr became Deputy Leader of the official opposition party.

Following redistribution, Carr sought re-election in the 1990 provincial election in the riding of Crescentwood, where he defeated Progressive Conservative Tom DeNardi by 1,310 votes. The Liberals fell from twenty seats to seven in this election; Carr resigned his seat in February 1992.

===Post-provincial politics===
After resigning his seat in 1992, Carr worked as a columnist and was on the editorial board for the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;. In 1998, he left and became president and CEO of the Business Council of Manitoba, an organization which he co-founded and stayed with until 2015. In 2006, he advocated for the province to reduce its health costs, and to not exclude the option of privatization. &quot;Everything is worth studying, and it&#x27;s studied everywhere around the world. There are advances that have been made in other places, with cultures similar to our own, that could be applied here,&quot; said Carr. In this role, he also participated in the Winnipeg Consensus, which began with an unprecedented meeting held in October 2009, bringing together diverse organizations who agreed a national dialogue and a Canadian Clean Energy Strategy was needed on the role of energy in Canada&#x27;s environmental and economic future. In his role as the President of the Business Council of Manitoba, Carr also advocated for a temporary increase to the PST by 1% to assist municipalities with their infrastructure deficits.

Carr was also a board member on the Canada West Foundation and the Winnipeg Airports Authority, as well as vice-president of the Performing Arts Consortium of Winnipeg, and a director of the Manitoba Arts Stabilization Fund. Carr has also been active in the Canadian Jewish Congress.

In July 2011, Carr was awarded the Order of Manitoba.

===Federal politics===
In January 2014, Carr was announced as a candidate for the Liberal nomination in the federal riding of Winnipeg South Centre. He went on to win the nomination meeting and was declared the Liberal candidate for the 2015 federal election. He won the subsequent election on October 19, 2015, with 59.7 per cent of the vote. Two weeks later on November 4, 2015, Carr was officially sworn into the cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources.

==== Minister of Natural Resources ====

Carr&#x27;s earlier work on the Winnipeg Consensus formed the basis for Generation Energy, his signature initiative as Minister of Natural Resources, launched in April 2017. This began a national dialogue on Canada&#x27;s energy future aimed at finding out how Canadians want to meet Canada&#x27;s climate goals, create jobs and keep energy affordable. More than 380,000 people engaged in the dialogue through online platforms and in-person roundtables, including the Generation Energy Conference held in Winnipeg with more than 650 participants from across Canada and around the world. The ideas that came from the dialogue resulted in billions of dollars of investments in electric vehicles and alternative fuels, smart grids, clean energy solutions for rural and remote communities, energy efficient buildings and emerging renewable power solutions.

Carr worked closely with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, to develop the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (PCF). He oversaw the efforts of his department to implement 30 of the 50 identified actions under the PCF, including many of the aforementioned investments.

In this role, Carr also represented Canada at the June 2016 Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission Innovation, where he announced that the federal government will &quot;double its spending on clean-energy research to $775-million by 2020, and look for ways to boost the commercialization of the emerging technology.&quot; Carr then laid the groundwork for Canada to host the Clean Energy Ministerial/Mission Innovation in Vancouver in May 2019, which showcased Canada&#x27;s efforts to boost women in energy, indigenous clean energy entrepreneurship and launch Canada&#x27;s Energy Vision based on the results of the Generation Energy initiative.

On February 11, 2016, as Natural Resources Minister, Carr purchased seven tickets to an NHL game featuring the Winnipeg Jets versus the Boston Bruins. His guests included the energy ministers and ambassadors from the United States and Mexico. It was later revealed Carr expensed $1,258.25 for the tickets and $525.30 for limo transportation from the Fort Garry Hotel to Winnipeg&#x27;s MTS Centre arena. A spokesperson for Carr&#x27;s office stated that the spending was in line with treasury board directives on hospitality and provided an opportunity for discussions in advance of an energy summit the following day.

==== Minister of International Trade Diversification ====
On July 18, 2018, Carr was shuffled from Minister of Natural Resources to the newly created position of Minister of International Trade Diversification. The addition of the word diversification to the title signaled a new foreign policy focus on diversifying Canada&#x27;s trade partners beyond the United States. It also furthered the work of his predecessor in welcoming more inclusive trade, where more Canadians are encouraged to participate in international trade and investment, including owners of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and businesses owned by often underrepresented Canadians, such as women, Indigenous peoples, youth and those who identify as LGBTQ2. In a November 2018 speech at the Toronto Region Board of Trade, Carr described the reason for the focus on diversifying those represented in Canada&#x27;s international trade: &quot;The more Canadians we have taking advantage of trade, the more wealth we can create here at home. Diversification is a national imperative. Trade diversification is a critical plank to our competitiveness.&quot;

In this role, Carr oversaw the expansion of Canada&#x27;s Trade Commissioner Service (TCS), which helps Canadian businesses find customers in other countries. The Fall 2018 Economic Statement dedicated $1.2 billion towards the Trade Diversification Strategy, helping Canadians export around the globe. This included $290 million over five years towards the TCS and a $100 million expansion of the CanExport program, which supports Canadian entrepreneurs looking to export.

This led to broadening opportunities for Canadian businesses to reach the 500 million consumers in European markets under the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), with the addition of 11 new trade commissioners across the EU, including enhanced presence in Milan.

In Canada, Carr announced the reopening of the TCS regional hub office in Winnipeg, which serves Canadian exporters in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

Carr oversaw initiatives to help close socio-economic gaps and create a trade environment where more Canadians can participate, including:

* Leading the first-ever government-led LGBTQ2 trade mission, at the NGLCC International Business Leadership Conference in Philadelphia in August 2018
* Expanding TCS resources across Canada to help connect Indigenous exporters to business opportunities abroad
* Delivering on a commitment to conduct a Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) as part of discussions towards a free trade agreement with Mercosur, marking &quot;the first time such an analysis has been conducted on an ongoing free trade negotiation anywhere in the world&quot;

In his time as Minister of International Trade Diversification, Carr welcomed the entry into force of one multilateral (CPTPP) and two bilateral (Chile and Israel) free trade agreements. The Canada-USA-Mexico agreement negotiations were concluded by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chrystia Freeland. Under Carr, negotiations continued with three other trading blocs: Mercosur, ASEAN and the Pacific Alliance.

===== Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) =====
Soon after he was sworn in, Carr picked up the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) file. Moving swiftly to ensure early preferential access for Canadian businesses, Carr and the federal government made the ratification of CPTPP in Canada a top priority, moving it though parliament in record time. Implementing legislation for the CPTPP, Bill C-79, was introduced for debate in the House of Commons by his predecessor on June 14, 2018. Carr introduced its second reading three months later, on September 17. Bill C-79 received royal assent on October 25 and Carr announced four days later that Canada was officially the 5th CPTPP country to ratify the agreement. In Carr&#x27;s words, the CPTPP legislation was introduced and moved &quot;with a speed reflecting the importance of the CPTPP to farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and workers across Canada.&quot;

By becoming one of the first six countries to ratify the agreement, Canada joined Australia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore in bringing the agreement into force on December 30, 2018. He attended the inaugural meeting of the CPTPP commission on January 19, 2019, in Tokyo, Japan. Carr and his predecessor, Francois-Philippe Champagne, marked the entry into force of the CPTPP with business owners and exporters at the Port of Vancouver on February 11, 2019. With the implementation of the CPTPP, and therefore free trade with Japan, Canada then became the only G7 country with trade agreements with all six other G7 partners.

===== Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) =====
On February 4, 2019, Carr met with Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Roberto Ampuero to mark the entry into force of the modernized Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA). The CCFTA was updated from its 1997 version, and is notable for making Canada the first G20 country to have a free trade agreement with a chapter on trade and gender. In welcoming the modernization, Carr said: &quot;This milestone agreement will help further encourage trade between Canada and Chile, by stimulating investment and creating new jobs. It has been modernized to reflect the Canadian economy of today, including the dynamic leadership that women continue to demonstrate as entrepreneurs and innovators.&quot;

===== Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) =====
In the spring of 2019, the modernized Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) received royal assent, and Carr welcomed its entry into force on September 1, 2019. CIFTA became the second Canadian free trade agreement to include a chapter on gender, and implemented additional components aimed at &quot;creating conditions for trade where more people can participate and benefit from the wealth it creates. This means including more small and medium-sized businesses, defending workers&#x27; rights, encouraging the participation of women-owned businesses and protecting the environment.&quot;

===== International Education Strategy =====
International education also falls under the purview of the Minister of International Trade Diversification. Carr unveiled Canada&#x27;s new International Education Strategy on August 22, 2019. It encourages more young Canadians to study and work abroad, including financial support for 11,000 students over five years through the Outbound Mobility Program pilot project, to be delivered by Colleges and Institutes Canada and Universities Canada.

===== Corporate social responsibility =====
In the area of corporate responsibility, Carr announced the appointment of Sheri Meyerhoffer as Canada&#x27;s first Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) on April 8, 2019. Meyerhoffer&#x27;s mandate, described as a world first, is to &quot;review allegations of human rights abuses arising from the operations of Canadian companies abroad&quot; and to make recommendations. Her role focuses on the mining, garment, oil and gas sectors. According to the news release, &quot;companies that do not cooperate could face trade measures, including the withdrawal of trade advocacy services and future Export Development Canada support.&quot;

==== Second term ====
Carr was re-elected to a second term as Member for Winnipeg South Centre in the 2019 federal election, winning 45% of the vote in a rematch with Joyce Bateman.

The day after his election, Carr was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He stepped down from Cabinet to fight it, but accepted a role as federal government&#x27;s special representative to the Prairies. Carr described the role as being &quot;the prime minister&#x27;s eyes and ears and voice in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta&quot;. On January 12, 2021, Carr returned to cabinet as minister without portfolio while keeping his special representative role. Carr is the first Minister without Portfolio in the Canadian Cabinet since 1978, a position last appointed by Pierre Trudeau.

====Third term====
Carr was re-elected to a third term as Member for Winnipeg South Centre in the 2021 federal election. Following his re-election, Carr was not re-appointed to Cabinet. Instead, he was appointed Chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security and the subcommittee on that committee&#x27;s agenda and procedure until his resignation from those roles in September 2022.

Carr&#x27;s Private Member&#x27;s Bill, Bill C-235, &quot;An Act respecting the building of a green economy in the Prairies&quot;, was a major focus of his third term. In his final speech in the House before his death, regarding his Bill C-235, Carr said &quot;I love every square metre of this country in English, en Francais, in Indigenous languages — I wish I spoke more of them — in the language of the newly arrived and all that represents to Canada and Canadians.&quot; Carr witnessed the successful vote on his Bill, just days before his death.

==Personal life and death==
Carr was Jewish. He was a descendant of Jewish immigrants who arrived from Russia in 1906. He had his bar mitzvah at Shaarey Zedek Synagogue in 1964.

On October 25, 2019, Carr issued a statement about having felt flu-like symptoms during the campaign. Blood tests revealed shortly afterward that he had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. He said that he would commence chemotherapy and dialysis treatment whilst remaining in the House of Commons. Carr died of cancer at home in Winnipeg, on December 12, 2022. He was 71.

His son Ben Carr is an educator, a former staffer to Mélanie Joly, and succeeded him as the Member for Winnipeg South Centre in a by-election in 2023.

<text>The East Neuk () or East Neuk of Fife is an area of the coast of Fife, Scotland.

&quot;Neuk&quot; is the Scots word for nook or corner, and the East Neuk is generally accepted to comprise the fishing villages of the most northerly part of the Firth of Forth and the land and villages slightly inland. It would include Elie and Earlsferry, Colinsburgh, St Monans, Pittenweem, Arncroach, Carnbee, Anstruther, Cellardyke, Kilrenny, Crail, and the immediate hinterland, as far as the upland area known as the Riggin o Fife.

The area houses a Cold War era bunker near Crail. Built in the late 1950s to be a regional seat of government in the event of a nuclear war, it is now a tourist attraction.

<text>FileZilla is a free and open-source, cross-platform FTP application, consisting of FileZilla Client and FileZilla Server. Clients are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Both server and client support FTP and FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS), while the client can in addition connect to SFTP servers. FileZilla&#x27;s source code is hosted on SourceForge.

==History==
FileZilla was started as a computer science class project in the second week of January 2001 by Tim Kosse and two classmates.

Before they started to write the code, they discussed under which license they should release it. They decided to make FileZilla an open-source project because many FTP clients were already available, and they didn&#x27;t think that they would sell a single copy if they made FileZilla commercial. Since its initial development in 2001, FileZilla has been released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The FileZilla client is currently released under GPL-2.0-or-later, and the server package under AGPL-3.0-or-later.

FileZilla featured as SourceForge&#x27;s &quot;Project of the Month&quot; in November 2003.

==Features==

FileZilla Client allows file transfer using both FTP and encrypted FTP such as FTPS (server and client) and SFTP, with support for IPv6. One of its most notable features is its capability to pause and resume file transfer processes, even for files larger than 4GB. Users can chose to overwrite existing files based on the age or size of the file. It also allows the preservation of timestamps on transferred files, provided there is support from the local system when downloading or from the target server when uploading.

FileZilla Client uses a tabbed user interface for multitasking, allowing users to browse more than one server or transfer files simultaneously between multiple servers. It also features a Site Manager to manage server lists and a transfer queue for ordering file transfer tasks. It has bookmarks for easy access and supports drag and drop for downloads and uploads. The software provides directory comparison for comparing local files and server files in the same directory. If there is a difference in the file details, such as a mismatch in name or size, the software will highlight the file in colour.

Other features include configurable transfer speed limits, filename filters, a network configuration wizard, remote file editing, keep-alive command to prevent disconnections when idle, HTTP/1.1, SOCKS5 and FTP-Proxy support, and logging events to a file for debugging. Additionally, users can export queues into an XML format file, browse directories synchronously, and remotely search for files on the server.

FileZilla Client is a cross-platform software, runs on Windows, Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X, and available in 47 languages worldwide, including Arabic, Armenian, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Corsican, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Georgian, Khmer, Korean, Kurdish, Kyrgyz, Lithuanian, Latvian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Nepali, Occitan, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

These are some features of FileZilla Server:
* FTP and FTP over TLS (FTPS)
* IPv6 support
* Speed limits
* Large file support &gt;4GB
* Remote administration
* Permissions system with users and groups
* IP filters

==Reception==
In May 2008, Chris Foresman assessed FTP clients for &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, saying of FileZilla: &quot;Some friends in the tech support world often recommend the free and open-source FileZilla, which offers a Mac OS X version in addition to Windows and Linux. But I&#x27;ve never been thrilled about its busy interface, which can be daunting for novice users.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Ars Technica&quot; in August 2008 Emil Protalinski said: &quot;this week&#x27;s free, third-party application recommendation is FileZilla... This FTP client is very quick and is regularly updated. It may not have a beautiful GUI, but it certainly is fast and has never let me down.&quot;

GoDaddy, Clarion University of Pennsylvania and National Capital FreeNet recommend FileZilla for uploading files to their web hosting services.

FileZilla is available in the repositories of many Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.

In January 2012, CNET gave FileZilla their highest rating of &quot;spectacular&quot;—five out of five stars.

 FileZilla is regularly listed in articles on the top free software applications.

Since the project&#x27;s participation in SourceForge&#x27;s program to create revenue by adware, several reviewers started warning about downloading FileZilla and discouraged users from using it.

==Criticism==

===Bundled adware issues===

In 2013 the project&#x27;s hosting site, SourceForge.net, provided the main download of FileZilla with a download wrapper, &quot;offering&quot; additional software for the user to install. Numerous users reported that some of the adware installed without consent, despite declining all install requests, or used deception to obtain the user&#x27;s &quot;acceptance&quot; to install. Among the reported effects are: web browser being hijacked, with content, start page and search engines being forcibly changed, popup windows, privacy or spying issues, sudden shutdown and restart events possibly leading to loss of current work. Some of the adware was reported to resist removal or restoration of previous settings, or were said to reinstall after a supposed removal. Also, users reported adware programs to download and install more unwanted software, some causing alerts by security suites, for being malware.

The FileZilla webpage offers additional download options without adware installs, but the link to the adware download appears as the primary link, highlighted and marked as &quot;recommended&quot;.

As of 2016, FileZilla displays ads (called sponsored updates) when starting the application. These ads appear as part of the &quot;Check for updates&quot; dialog.

In 2018, a further controversy about FileZilla&#x27;s use of a bundled adware installer caused concern.

===Plain text password storage===
Until version 3.26 FileZilla stored all saved usernames and passwords as plain text, allowing any malware that had gained even limited access to the user&#x27;s system to read the data. FileZilla author Tim Kosse was reluctant to add encrypted storage. He stated that it gives a false sense of security, since well-crafted malware can include a keylogger that reads the master password used to secure the data. Users have argued that reading the master password to decrypt the encrypted storage is still harder than just reading the unencrypted storage. A fork called &quot;FileZilla Secure&quot; was started in November 2016 to add encrypted storage. In May 2017, encrypted storage was also added to the main version, 10 years after it was first requested. Kosse maintained that the feature did not really increase security, as long as the operating system is not secure.

==FileZilla Server==
FileZilla Server is a sister product to FileZilla Client. It is an FTP server supported by the same project and features support for FTP and FTP over SSL/TLS. FileZilla Server is currently available for Linux, MacOS and Windows platforms.

FileZilla Server is a free, open-source FTP server. Its source code is hosted on the FileZilla Project website.

===Features===
FileZilla Server supports FTP and FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS). Other features include:
* Encryption with SSL/TLS (for FTPS)
* Per-user permissions on the underlying file system
* GUI configuration tool
* Speed limits
* IP filtering

==FileZilla Client issues==
Unlike some other FTP clients, FileZilla Client does not implement a workaround for an error in the IIS server which causes file corruption when resuming large file downloads.

Reykjavík University has its roots in the Commercial College of Iceland, School of Computer Science (TVÍ), which was founded in January 1988 and operated within the Commercial College of Iceland (VÍ) facilities for ten years.

Reykjavík University started its first semester on 1 September 1998, in a new building under the name Reykjavík School of Business. TVÍ became one of two departments within the school. A name change was inevitable because the school&#x27;s name was not descriptive for the variety of the school&#x27;s operations.

In January 2000, the name was changed to Reykjavík University. In the autumn of 2002, the School of Law was established at Reykjavík University and in 2005, Reykjavík University was merged with the Technical University of Iceland (THÍ) under the name Reykjavík University. Following the merger, the School of Science and Engineering was established, partly built upon the old foundation of THÍ with the addition of new engineering fields.

<doc id="1119054" wikidata="Q536076" url="?curid=1119054" title="John Walter Smith">
<text>John Walter Smith (February 5, 1845April 19, 1925), was an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party in the United States, held several public offices representing the state of Maryland. From 1899 to 1900, he was a U.S. congressman for the 1st district of Maryland; from 1900 to 1904, he was the 44th Governor of Maryland; and from 1908 to 1921, he served in the U.S. Senate, first as the junior senator for Maryland, and from November 1912 as the senior senator.

==Early life and career==
Smith was born at Snow Hill, Maryland, and attended private schools and Union Academy. His mother died when he was five weeks old, and his father died when he was five years old. Ephraim King Wilson, Smith&#x27;s cousin, assumed guardianship of Smith, and raised him. He engaged in the lumber business in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina before becoming president of the First National Bank of Snow Hill and director in many business and financial institutions.

Beginning his political career, Smith was elected to the Maryland State Senate in 1889, 1893, and 1897, and served as president of the Senate in 1894. Following the death of U.S. Senator to Maryland Ephraim K. Wilson in 1891, Smith sought to be elected to replace him, but lost nomination to fellow Democrat Charles H. Gibson. He was elected to the 56th Congress in 1898 from the 1st Congressional district of Maryland, but served for less than a year before being unexpectedly nominated for Governor of Maryland by the Democratic State Convention in 1899. Smith was victorious against incumbent governor Lloyd Lowndes, Jr.

==Governor of Maryland==

As Governor, Smith promoted education, labor, and healthcare reform. In education, Smith reorganized the public school system, guaranteed free textbooks for all students, appointed a school superintendent, and removed the Agricultural College of Maryland (now known as the University of Maryland, College Park) from private control and placed it under the guidance of the State. He also improved the State&#x27;s workmen&#x27;s compensation program, encouraged a merit system for promotions, reorganized health laws and constructed a State psychiatric hospital. Governor Smith is also credited with signing into law the Certified Public Accountant Act, making Maryland the third state to create a Profession of Public Accounting with an exam, and state licensing and oversight. Smith also freed the State from much of its debt by the time he departed from the position in 1904.

==U.S. Senate==

After another unsuccessful attempt at a Senate election in 1904, Smith was elected in January 1908 to succeed William Pinkney Whyte whose term ended in 1909. When Whyte died in March 1908, Smith was then also elected to finish the term. He was re-elected in 1914 and served from March 25, 1908, to March 3, 1921. He lost election in 1920 for a third term as Senator to Ovington E. Weller.

As senator, Smith was chairman of the Committee to Investigate Trespassers Upon Land (62nd Congress), the Committee on the District of Columbia (63rd through 65th Congresses), and the Committee to Examine Branches of the Civil Service (66th Congress).

Smith retired to private life and died in Baltimore, Maryland on April 19, 1925 after a short illness. He is buried in the Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Snow Hill, Maryland.

<text>The Leverhulme Trust () is a large national grant-making organisation in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1925 under the will of the 1st Viscount Leverhulme (1851–1925), with the instruction that its resources should be used to cover certain trade charities and support &quot;scholarships for the purposes of research and education.&quot; Over time, it has come to focus on the latter aim. 

The Trust is based in London and is a registered charity under English law.

The current Chair of the Trust is Alan Jope CBE. 

==Activities==
Since its foundation in 1925, the Trust has provided funding for research projects, fellowships, studentships, bursaries and prizes. It operates across all academic disciplines with the intention of supporting individuals in research and professional training.

Dispensing over £100 million a year, the Trust is one of the largest providers of research funding in the UK.

The Trust places special weight on:
* the originality of the projects put to them;
* the significance of the proposed work;
* the ability to judge and take appropriate risk in the project;
* the removal of barriers between traditional disciplines.

== History ==

Victorian businessman and entrepreneur William Hesketh Lever manufactured and marketed Sunlight soap. In order to produce cheap soap and undercut competition, he controlled large concessionary areas in the Congo. These were granted to him by King Leopold, with whom he was a close friend. Many Congolese were exploited for use in forced labour which was allowed to continue for many decades before coming to light.

Lever extended his business activities in ways that both served and profited from the rapid rise of a mass market for basic consumer products. He was also a philanthropist, supporting a variety of educational, religious, civic, community and medical causes. His achievements were recognised in 1922 when the title of Lord Leverhulme of the Western Isles was conferred upon him.

On his death in 1925, Lord Leverhulme left a proportion of his interest in the company he had founded, Lever Brothers, in trust for specific beneficiaries: to include first certain trade charities and secondly the provision of &quot;scholarships for the purposes of research and education&quot;. The Leverhulme Trust was established. In the succeeding years, Lever Brothers became a cornerstone of Unilever, created in 1930 by the merger of Lever Brothers with Margarine Unie of the Netherlands. The Leverhulme Trust&#x27;s shareholding thus became part of Unilever plc. November 1983 saw an evolution in the arrangements for the two charitable objectives. Subsequently, the Leverhulme Trust has been able to give concentrated attention to research and education.

== Grant schemes ==

The Trust seeks to provide mechanisms for the support of researchers and students, and currently offers the following schemes:

;Research Project Grants: Provide funds to employ research staff for up to five years on an original project of high quality and potential. Choice of theme and the design of the research depend on the applicant.

;Research Leadership Awards: Available every three years. They support researchers who have begun a university career and need to build a research team able to tackle an identified but distinctive research problem. Each UK institution is limited to one bid only.

;Study Abroad Studentships: Support for up to two years of advanced study or research at a centre of learning in any overseas country, with the exception of the United States.

;Early Career Fellowships: Provide career development opportunities of two or three years. For those who are at a relatively early stage of their academic careers but with a proven record of research.

;Research Fellowships: Provide support for up to two years for experienced researchers, particularly those who have been prevented by routine duties from completing a programme of original research. Awards are not limited to those holding appointments in higher education.

;International Fellowships: Open to those holding a full-time post in a UK institution of higher education or comparable institution and support a period overseas in a stimulating academic environment for up to two years.

;Major Research Fellowships: Provide up to three years of full-time teaching replacement so that the applicant can concentrate on a piece of research, typically bringing it forward to publication as a monograph.

;Emeritus Fellowships: Provide support for up to two years of research to be conducted by the applicant following retirement from an academic post.

;Visiting Professorships: Enable distinguished academics based overseas to spend up to ten months at a UK university, primarily in order to enhance the skills of academic staff or the student body within the host institution.

;Philip Leverhulme Prizes: Awarded to outstanding scholars who have made a &#x27;substantial and recognised&#x27; contribution to their particular field of study, are recognised at an international level, and where the expectation is that they have further progress to make.

;Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships: Support doctoral studies in UK universities and nurture the future generation of young researchers. Each award funds 15 Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships at that institution.

;Arts Scholarships: Provide training opportunities across the whole range of artistic disciplines in the fine and performing arts. Arts scholarships may be in the form of: (a) bursaries to enable individuals to develop their talent, and/or; (b) innovative teaching awards to provide new and original training opportunities for the students concerned.

<doc id="1119057" wikidata="Q7548186" url="?curid=1119057" title="Snow Bowl (1950)">
<text>The Snow Bowl is the nickname of a college football game played on November 25, 1950, between the teams of the University of Michigan and Ohio State University. The Michigan Wolverines defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes, 9–3, earning the Big Ten Conference championship and a berth in the 1951 Rose Bowl. The game was one of the most noted in the storied history of the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry.

==What was at stake==
The Big Ten Conference football championship in the 1950 college football season was on the line. The Wolverines were playing also for a berth in the 1951 Rose Bowl game. Ohio State had gone the previous year; the Big Ten Conference had a no-repeat rule regarding the Rose Bowl representative at that time. If Michigan had lost this game, the likely Rose Bowl representative would have been second place Wisconsin, which finished with a 5–2 record. If the game had not been played, which was a proposal put forth at game time, Ohio State would have been the Big Ten champion.

==Game summary==

The game was played at Ohio Stadium, in Columbus, Ohio, under severe weather that altered the normal playing of the game dramatically. The conditions were deplorable with the temperature at 10 degrees, winds gusting to 28 miles per hour out of the northwest and snow falling at two inches per hour. Snow banks lined the field, yard lines were obliterated and at times so, too, were the goal posts.

Before the game, Ohio State coach Wes Fesler and OSU athletic director Dick Larkins went to talk to Michigan athletic director Fritz Crisler and coach Bennie Oosterbaan about whether or not to play the game. Neither Fesler nor Oosterbaan wanted to play the game and Crisler indicated that Michigan would forfeit but would not reschedule the game. Larkins would not accept the forfeit and the game proceeded as scheduled.

The game was set to be played in front of 50,535 fans, some of whom built small bonfires in the stands to keep warm. Others sat with boxes over their heads to shield from the cold, with holes cut in to peer out. As the game was set to begin, grounds crews struggled to get the tarp off of the frozen field with four feet of snow on top of it. Local Boy Scouts and fans had to help with the tarps, finally removing them 2:21 hours late.

Michigan won the game 9–3, despite never getting a first down, failing on all nine pass attempts and punting 24 times. The Buckeyes had just three first downs, passed for a total of 18 yards, rushed for 16 yards (11 fewer than U-M) and punted 21 times, four of which were blocked. Overall, the teams punted 45 times during the game, sometimes on first down based on the strategy that both teams felt it better to have the ball in the hands of their opponents near the end zone and hope for a fumble of the slippery ball. In the end, Ohio State Halfback Vic Janowicz (who went on to win the Heisman Trophy) punted for 685 yards while Michigan&#x27;s Chuck Ortmann punted for 723 yards.

The first score of the game came when Buckeye defensive guard Bob Momsen blocked an Ortmann punt and fell on it at the Michigan 8-yard line late in the first quarter of the game. The Buckeyes ran three straight running plays that went for minus-13 yards, putting the ball back to the 21. Janowicz was called upon to kick a 38-yard field goal into the swirling wind with the goal posts barely in view. He made it to give the Buckeyes a 3–0 lead. The kick would later be called one of the &quot;Greatest Feats in American Sports&quot; by a panel of sports writers.

In the second quarter, Michigan tackle Al Wahl blocked a Janowicz punt deep in Ohio State territory. The blocked ball rolled out of the back of the end zone for a safety, giving Michigan their first score of the game and trimming the Buckeyes&#x27; lead to 3–2. Michigan scored what proved to be the winning touchdown when with 20 seconds remaining in the first half, Janowicz attempted a third down punt, only to have Michigan&#x27;s Tony Momsen (brother of Ohio State&#x27;s Bob Momsen) break through the line and block the punt. Momsen fell on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown and U-M kicked the extra-point to go up 9–3. OSU coach Fesler could have run another play instead of punting on third down and let the clock expire on the half, but he feared a fumble (there were 10 that day) that would be recovered as a touchdown by Michigan.

Neither team would threaten to score again, and Michigan went on to win the game 9–3 and claim the conference title and chance to go to the Rose Bowl. The loss was Fesler&#x27;s fourth straight to Michigan, and he submitted his resignation 18 days later. Fesler was replaced by Woody Hayes.

==Other uses==
The nickname has also been more recently used to refer to various other games, including the 2000 Independence Bowl, a 43–41 overtime win by Mississippi State over Texas A&amp;M. The 1992 meeting of Penn State and Notre Dame at Notre Dame Stadium is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Snow Bowl.&quot; Heavy snow slowed both teams, with Notre Dame coming from behind to win, 17–16.

<text>A legitimating ideology, a term used by sociologists C. Wright Mills and others, refers generally to any ideology which is used to legitimate the actions or policies of states.

The legitimating ideology employed may or may not have an apparent connection to the substance or form of the actions or policies being legitimated by the ideology. It is primarily a term used when making a critical analysis of religious institutions, and corporate and state actions and policies.

<doc id="1119078" wikidata="Q881279" url="?curid=1119078" title="Lloyd Lowndes Jr.">
<text>Lloyd Lowndes Jr. (February 21, 1845 – January 8, 1905), a member of the United States Republican Party, was an American attorney and politician, the 43rd Governor of Maryland from 1896 to 1900 and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the sixth district of Maryland from 1873 to 1875.

==Early life and education==
He was born in 1845 in Clarksburg, Virginia (now West Virginia), son of Lloyd Lowndes and Elizabeth Moore; he was a great-grandson of early Bladensburg, Maryland settler, Christopher Lowndes. He attended Allegheny College in Pennsylvania, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He graduated from the law department of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1867.

==Marriage and family==
He married his first cousin, Elizabeth Tasker Lowndes, daughter of Richard Tasker Lowndes and Louisa Black.

==Political career==

After starting his law practice, Lowndes turned to politics. He found that the Democratic Party was regaining political control in Maryland. After being elected to one term in Congress in 1872, he did not succeed in gaining re-election after his term ended in 1875. He returned to his law practice.

At the end of the century, however, Lowndes ran for governor in 1896, was supported by a strong Republican biracial coalition, and won the election. In addition, Maryland was one of several &quot;border states&quot; that had voted for Republican candidate William McKinley in a major sweep that showed a realignment nationally; Lowndes and some Republican state legislators and congressmen, such as Sydney Emanuel Mudd, were likely also elected on McKinley&#x27;s coattails. McKinley&#x27;s win ended free silver as an issue and American society embraced its industrial present.

Lowndes died in 1905 of heart failure, in Cumberland, Maryland, and is buried at the Rose Hill Cemetery there.

<text>ArtistShare is the internet&#x27;s first commercial crowdfunding website. It also operates as a record label and business model for artists which enables them to fund their projects by allowing the general public to directly finance, watch the creative process, and in most cases gain access to extra material from an artist. According to Bloomberg News, the company&#x27;s chief executive officer, record producer Brian Camelio, founded ArtistShare in 2000 with the idea that fans would finance production costs for albums sold only on the Internet and Artists also would enjoy much more favourable contract terms. ArtistShare was described in 2005 as a &quot;completely new business model for creative artists&quot; which &quot;benefits both the artist and the fans by financing new and original artistic projects while building a strong and loyal fan base&quot;.

==History==

A United States–based company, ArtistShare (2001) is documented as being the first crowdfunding website followed later by sites such as Sellaband (2006), SliceThePie (2007), IndieGoGo (2008), Spot.us (2008), Pledge Music (2009), and Kickstarter (2009).

ArtistShare projects have received 29 Grammy nominations and 10 Grammy awards to date.

In 2005, American composer Maria Schneider&#x27;s &quot;Concert in the Garden&quot; became the first album in Grammy history to win an award without being available in retail stores. The album was ArtistShare&#x27;s first fan-funded project. Schneider received four nominations that year for the fan-funded album and won the Grammy for &quot;Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album&quot;. According to ArtistShare.com, ArtistShare artists consist of &quot;some of today&#x27;s most prestigious artists including Pulitzer prize and Oscar nominated writers, Guggenheim fellowship recipients and NEA Jazz Masters&quot;.

In May 2013, ArtistShare partnered with Blue Note Records to form a collaboration titled &#x27;Blue Note/ArtistShare&#x27;. The Blue Note/ArtistShare collaboration was forged by Brian Camelio, Bruce Lundvall, and Don Was, President of Blue Note Records. In Blue Note&#x27;s press release about the collaboration, Lundvall, Blue Note Chairman Emeritus, is quoted as saying, &quot;&#x27;ArtistShare founder Brian Camelio is a true visionary. I see the ArtistShare business model as a key component of the future music business&#x27;&quot; The collaboration will &quot;&#x27;essentially serve as a low-risk development arm of the label&#x27;&quot; since the recordings will be funded by the fans.

== Grammy Awards==
* Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album: &quot;Concert in the Garden&quot; by Maria Schneider (2005); &quot;The Thompson Fields&quot; by Maria Schneider (2015)
* Best Instrumental Composition: &quot;Into the Light&quot; by Billy Childs (2006); &quot;Cerulean Skies&quot; by Maria Schneider (2008); &quot;The Path Among the Trees&quot; by Billy Childs (2011); &quot;How About You&quot; from the &quot;Gil Evans Project:Centennial&quot; (2013)
* Best Latin Jazz Album: &quot;Simpático&quot; by Brian Lynch and Eddie Palmieri (2007)
* Best Contemporary Classical Composition: &quot;Winter Morning Walks&quot;, by Maria Schneider (2014)
* Best Classical Vocal Solo: Dawn Upshaw, &quot;Winter Morning Walks&quot;
* Best Engineered Album, Classical: &quot;Winter Morning Walks&quot;

==Patent dispute==
On September 30, 2011, Kickstarter filed a declaratory judgment suit against ArtistShare and Fan Funded which owns U.S. patent , &quot;Methods and apparatuses for financing and marketing a creative work&quot;.

In June 2015, US District Judge Katherine Failla ruled in favor of KickStarter against ArtistShare.

<doc id="1119090" wikidata="Q3375237" url="?curid=1119090" title="No-win situation">
<text>A no-win situation or lose–lose situation is an outcome of a negotiation, conflict or challenging circumstance in which all parties are worse off. It is an alternative to a win-win or outcome in which one party wins. Arbitration or mediation may be used to avoid no-win outcomes and find more satisfactory results.

==In game theory==
In game theory, a &quot;no-win&quot; situation is a circumstance in which no player benefits from any outcome, hence ultimately losing the match. This may be because of any or all of the following:
* Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in text adventures.
* &quot;Zugzwang&quot;, as in chess, when any move a player chooses makes them worse off than before such as losing a piece or being checkmated.
* A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks each of which must be completed before the other or that are mutually exclusive (a Catch-22).
* Ignorance of other players&#x27; actions, meaning the best decision for all differs from that for any one player (as in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma).

==In history==
Carl von Clausewitz&#x27;s advice never to launch a war that one has not already won characterizes war as a no-win situation. A similar example is the Pyrrhic victory in which a military victory is so costly that the winning side actually ends up worse off than before it started. Looking at the victory as a part of a larger situation, the situation could either be no-win, or more of a win for the other side than the one that won the &quot;victory&quot;, or victory at such cost that the gains are outweighed by the cost and are no longer a source of joy.

For example, the &quot;victorious&quot; side may have accomplished their objective, which may have been worthless; it may also lose a strategic advantage in manpower or positioning. For example, the British Empire was one of the victorious powers of the Second World War but was so weakened by the war that it could no longer maintain its status as a great power in a world that became dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union.

A related concept is sometimes described as &quot;winning the battle but losing the war&quot;, where a lesser objective is won, but the greater objective beyond it is not well-pursued and is lost.

In the past in Europe, women accused of being witches were sometimes bound and then thrown or dunked in water to test their innocence. A witch would float (by calling upon the devil to save her from drowning), and then be executed, but a non-witch would drown (proving her innocence but causing her death).

==Alternative meaning of the term==
A different form of a no-win situation is where a person or government will look bad no matter what they or it does. Sometimes such is described as a situation destined for failure, expressed by the phrase &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t.&quot;

A no-win situation is a situation where no matter what you do, the outcome will be negative.

<text>Ready-to-assemble furniture (RTA), also known as knock-down furniture (KD), flat-pack furniture, or kit furniture, is a form of furniture that requires customer assembly. The separate components are packed for sale in cartons which also contain assembly instructions and sometimes hardware. The furniture is generally simple to assemble with basic tools such as hex keys, which are also sometimes included. Ready-to-assemble furniture is popular with consumers who wish to save money by assembling the product themselves.

Producers and merchants benefit from selling ready-to-assemble furniture because furniture is bulky once assembled, and thus more expensive to store and to deliver. Since the assembly work is done by the consumer instead of by the manufacturer, its price can be lower. A furniture assembly service industry has developed, making it easy for consumers to employ someone knowledgeable to assemble their furniture for them.

Produced mainly from particle board or medium-density fibreboard (MDF), the cost of producing this type of furniture is cheaper than using solid wood. The low grade timber is coated with a polymer laminate to replicate various types of wood, allowing a high quality looking finished product.

==History==

Ready-to-assemble furniture has roots that extend back a long way, as cabinetmakers have been making furniture that is easy to disassemble for transport for centuries. The &quot;New American Cyclopaedia of 1859&quot; listed the assembly of furniture as an &quot;American invention&quot; that emphasized ease of transport, but this claim is rather vague. A better claim to the earliest RTA furniture is the Thonet No. 14 bentwood chair, which was specifically made to be easily disassembled to save space during transportation. It was first produced in 1859. Slightly later there is an American patent of 1878 that defines some prefabricated furniture as follows: &quot;The invention refers to a class of furniture in kit to be packaged and transported in pieces and assembled by specialized and unqualified people.&quot;

An early attempt at a business selling RTA furniture was set up by designer Louise Brigham and two partners during World War I. By 1915, Home Art Masters was offering RTA furniture kits at moderate prices through a mail-order catalog. The buyer received a set of parts that the company stated could be “quickly put together and finished. Everything including instructions, furnished. A boy or girl can set it up.” Home Art Masters was short-lived and it is uncertain how many of their RTA furniture kits were ever sold.

The next experiments in running an RTA business stem from the 1940s and 1950s. In the late 1940s, the Australian designer Frederick Charles Ward founded a mail-order RTA furniture business because he was disturbed by how little affordable furniture there was for people of modest means. Lena Larsson helped to create one of the earliest Swedish brands of ready to assemble furniture, the TRIVA line, for Nordiska Kompaniet in 1943. In 1953, the Ohio cabinetmaker Erie J. Sauder received the first U.S. patent for RTA furniture for a table that could be assembled without either hardware or glue; he called it &quot;snap-together&quot; furniture.

In the Scandinavian countries, the furniture kit may have been independently invented by Swedish technician Gillis Lundgren, who had the idea when trying to transport a table in his car. According to reports, he had to saw off the table&#x27;s legs so he could put it inside the car and bring it home. He talked about the idea with his boss at IKEA, and IKEA started selling flat-pack furniture in 1956.

<text>Stolpen (, ) is a town in the district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, in Saxony, Germany. It is a historical town, that grew at the foot of the &quot;Schloßberg&quot; with the castle &quot;Burg Stolpen&quot;.

== Burg Stolpen ==

Burg Stolpen is a castle built on top of the Schloßberg. The first defensive works were built about 1100 and it was first documented in 1222. Owned by the Bishop of Meißen for nearly 350 years, it passed to the Electorate of Saxony and was expanded in Renaissance style. In 1675 it was further expanded as a fortress. Anna Constantia von Brockdorff, Countess of Cosel, was imprisoned in the castle from 1716 until her death in 1765. The castle fell into disrepair towards the end of the 18th century. It became a museum in 1875, and has been partly restored since then.

== Schloßberg ==

Schloßberg is a hill just to the south of the town formed of prominent basalt columns. It is the formation referred to by Georgius Agricola when he coined the term &quot;basalt&quot;.

==Historical population==

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Stolpen is twinned with:

* Hilzingen, Germany 
* Amöneburg, Germany
* Garching an der Alz, Germany
* Jockgrim, Germany
* Sipplingen, Germany
* Sloup v Čechách, Czech Republic

==Notable people==
*Walter von Boetticher (1853–1945), historian and physician, was a general practitioner at Stolpen
*The Doll Family, a circus sideshow act, were born in Stolpen
*Christian Friedrich Henrici, also known as Picander, Bach&#x27;s librettist (St Matthew Passion&#x27;s text was written by him) was born here.

<doc id="1119122" wikidata="Q2063871" url="?curid=1119122" title="Yuki people">
<text>The Yuki (also known as Yukiah) are an Indigenous people of California who were traditionally divided into three groups: &quot;Ukomno&#x27;om&quot; (&quot;Valley People&quot;, or Yuki proper), &quot;Huchnom&quot; (&quot;Outside the Valley&quot;), and &quot;Ukohtontilka&quot; or &quot;Ukosontilka&quot; (&quot;Ocean People&quot;, or Coast Yuki). The territory of these three groups included Round Valley and much of northern Mendocino County and Lake County. Today they are enrolled members of the Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation. The exonym &quot;Yuki&quot; may derive from the Wintu word meaning &quot;foreigner&quot; or &quot;enemy.&quot;

Yuki tribes are thought to have settled as far south as Hood Mountain in present-day Sonoma County.

==History==
Archaeologists, including Alfred Kroeber, have speculated that the Yuki have been resident in California for many thousands of years and once occupying a greater area than their historic homeland in Mendocino County. The Yuki language is an isolate, unrelated to other Native American languages, although distant relationships to other languages have been proposed by Joseph Greenberg and others. Scholars have also said that Yuki physical appearance is different than most other Native American peoples. They are described as short in stature and long-headed (Dolichocephalic), unusual in American Indians, but perhaps similar to the extinct Guaycura and Pericú of Baja California, also believed by archaeologists to be ancient residents of the Americas. 

In 1856, the US government established the Indian reservation of Nome Cult Farm (later to become Round Valley Indian Reservation) at Round Valley. It forced thousands of Yuki and other local tribes onto these lands, often without sufficient support for the transition. These events and tensions led to the Mendocino War (1859), where militias of white settlers killed hundreds of Yuki and took others by force to Nome Cult Farm.

==Language==

The Yuki language has been extinct since its last speaker, Arthur Anderson, died in 1983. It is distantly related to the Wappo language, the two languages making up the entirety of the Yukian language family. The Yuki people had a quaternary (4-based) counting system, based on counting the spaces between the fingers, rather than the fingers themselves.

==Population==

Scholarly estimates have varied substantially for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California, as historians and anthropologists have tried to evaluate early documentation. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the 1770 population of the Yuki proper, &quot;Huchnom&quot;, and Coast Yuki as 2,000, 500, and 500, respectively, or 3,000 in all. Sherburne F. Cook initially raised this total slightly to 3,500. Subsequently, he proposed a higher estimate of 9,730 Yuki.

According to the research of Benjamin Madley, &quot;the Yuki suffered a cataclysmic population decline under United States rule. Between 1854 and 1864, settlement policies, murders, abductions, massacres, rape-induced venereal diseases, and willful neglect at Round Valley Reservation reduced them from perhaps 20,000 to several hundred.&quot; In his work, Madley argues that Yuki history constitutes a clear-cut example of genocide. He cites the fact that there is no evidence of any epidemic that would have caused such drastic population decline among the Yuki between 1854 and 1864, other than venereal diseases originating from European settlers. His research thus challenges the idea that the indirect effects of European colonization were the leading cause of population decline and mass death for Native Americans.

E.N. Anderson a professor of Anthropology at the University of California at Riverside writes that the extermination of the Yuki, a helpless colonized people, was a genocidal massacre.

Intermarriage among neighboring tribes after their forced relocation to the Round Valley Reservation resulted in large numbers of Native Americans with mixed ancestry. Many of these people are descendants of many local tribes and have come to be called Round Valley Indian Tribes.

In the 2010 census, 569 people claimed Yuki ancestry. 255 of them were full-blooded.

==Ethnobotany==
Yuki people use the large roots of Carex plants to make baskets.

<text>Stanko Todorov Georgiev (; 10 December 1920 – 17 December 1996) was a Bulgarian communist politician.

Todorov was born in Pernik Province. Before and during World War II he was a worker. He became interested in communism, first joining the Workers Youth League in 1936 then joining the underground Bulgarian Communist Party in 1943. By 1948, communists had come to power in Bulgaria, and Todorov began to rise through the ranks of the government. He became a member of the politburo in 1961 and held several government posts. He served as Prime Minister of Bulgaria, the third highest post in the country, from July 7, 1971, until June 16, 1981. At 9 years and 344 days, he is the longest-serving Bulgarian prime minister. He then became chairman of the parliament, serving in that position until the first multiparty elections in 1990. He supported the reformist wing of the Communist Party during this time, as pressure mounted on Bulgaria and other eastern European countries to reform. He took part in the removal of long-time party leader Todor Zhivkov from office in 1989. Just before the 1990 elections, Todorov served as acting President of Bulgaria from July 6, 1990, to July 17, 1990. He won a parliamentary seat in the elections, but resigned later that year for health reasons.

<doc id="1119125" wikidata="Q2330678" url="?curid=1119125" title="Masham">
<text>Masham ( ) is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. It had a population of 1,205 at the 2011 census.

The town is located northwest of York and was in the former Harrogate district. It is situated in the lower Wensleydale, on the western bank of the River Ure, just north of its confluence with the River Burn.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Mæssa&#x27;s Ham&quot;, the homestead belonging to Mæssa.

==History==
The Romans had a presence here, but the first permanent settlers were the Angles. Around 900 AD the Vikings invaded, burning and laying waste to the church. They also introduced sheep farming, for which the town is still known.

Masham was historically a large parish in the North Riding of Yorkshire. As well as the town of Masham the parish included the townships of Burton-on-Yore, Ellingstring, Ellington High and Low, Fearby, Healey with Sutton, Ilton cum Pott and Swinton. In 1866 the townships became separate civil parishes. Masham Moor was an area of moorland to the west of the parish bordering the West Riding, common to the parishes of Masham and East Witton. It was divided between the parishes of Healey, Ilton cum Pott and Colsterdale in 1934.

The area of the ancient parish, except Burton-on-Yore, was known as Mashamshire from the 12th century or earlier.

St Mary&#x27;s Church was most likely founded in the seventh century and stood somewhere near the present town hall on what used to be known as Cockpit Hill. The graveyard yielded 36 burials in a recent excavation. The present church – while having some Anglo-Saxon stonework and the stump of an eighth-century prayer cross – is mainly Norman with fifteenth-century additions. Masham was given to York Minster in the medieval period but, as the archbishop did not wish to make the long journey north to oversee the town&#x27;s affairs, the parish was designated a peculiar.

During the Middle Ages, Masham developed as a small town with milling, mining, cloth making and tanning industries. The town received its first market charter in 1251. Masham&#x27;s importance as a major sheep market is the reason for the large market place and its Georgian houses. The market originally thrived because of its nearness to Jervaulx and Fountains Abbeys, with their large flocks of sheep.

From 1875 the town was served by the Masham branch of the North Eastern Railway. Passenger services were stopped in December 1930, with goods traffic continuing until 1963. The station was across the River Ure at Low Burton.

The naturalist Charles Hedley (1862–1926) was born in Masham, where his father, the Rev. Canon Thomas Hedley, was vicar.

On 5 July 2014 the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the town.

==Governance==
Prior to local government reform in North Yorkshire in 2023, the town lay within the Borough of Harrogate. Masham was part of that borough&#x27;s electoral ward of Mashamshire. This ward stretched west to Colsterdale with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 2,350. Since 2023, the town is covered by North Yorkshire Council, a unitary authority.

As of 2025, the parish shares a grouped parish council, called Masham Parish Council, with Burton-on-Yore, Ellington High and Low, and Swinton with Warthermarske.

==Community==

Masham market days are Wednesday, Saturday and Bank Holiday Monday with a Farmers&#x27; Market every first Sunday of the month from April to September. An annual Sheep Fair is held in September, and the Masham breed is named after the town. The market place, the largest in the district, is tightly bordered on its south and west sides by ranges of two- and three-storey buildings. To the south-east, lies St. Mary&#x27;s Church with its large yard.

Although Masham is a relatively small town it has two working breweries, Black Sheep Brewery and Theakstons, situated only a few hundred yards from one another. The Black Sheep Brewery sponsors annual folk festivals. Previous performers have included Hugh Cornwell of The Stranglers. The town was also for a long time home to Lightfoot Brewery. This was bought by the Theakston family and closed in the 1920s. The Lightfoot brewery buildings are now used by Black Sheep.

The Masham Steam Engine &amp; Fair Organ Rally is held annually, organised by the Masham Town Hall Association; it began in 1965 to raise money for Masham Town Hall. The town holds an arts festival every two years.

The town has a snooker and billiards club, which was founded in 1871.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Bilsdale TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio York, Greatest Hits Radio Harrogate &amp; the Yorkshire Dales and Dales Radio.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Harrogate Advertiser&quot;.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations are Thirsk and Northallerton both of which are on the East Coast Main Line; although the town was formerly served by a station on the Masham branch railway. Buses operate from Ripon and the town is on the A6108 road between Ripon, Leyburn, Richmond and Scotch Corner. The town is several miles west of the A1(M) motorway.

<doc id="1119132" wikidata="Q1656463" url="?curid=1119132" title="Icon of Coil">
<text>Icon of Coil is a Norwegian electronic music band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live. With the release of &quot;Shallow Nation&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, Christian Lund joined the live lineup. Later that year, the band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Serenity is the Devil&quot;, was released, which climbed to number one on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member.

==History==
===Formation===
In 1997, Andy LaPlegua established the project, Icon of Coil, which was primarily a concept built around a logo, graphic design and music. Soon after the inception, the music soon turned out to be the most important part of the concept and LaPlegua invited Sebastian Komor, who he had worked with before on the project Sector 9, (now called Moonitor) in 1996, to work with him on the project as a live member. After just a couple of gigs and the release of IOC’s first single, &quot;Shallow Nation&quot;, Seb became a full-time member.

===&quot;Shallow Nation&quot; (2000)===
&quot;Shallow Nation&quot;, released early in 2000, sold out the first thousand copies after only two weeks in the stores, which resulted in a deal with the Norwegian record label Tatra Records. Around that same time Tatra Records released the compilation Sex, Goth &amp; Electronics, to which IOC contributed an exclusive version of their song &quot;Repeat It&quot;.

Before they started working on their second release, IOC did programming for the Apoptygma Berzerk track &quot;Starsign&quot;. Soon afterwards, they traveled to Germany, with live member Jon Holm, to support Apoptygma on their Welcome to Earth tour 2000 at their gigs in Frankfurt, Cottbus and Leipzig before going back to Norway to play together at Rockefeller in Oslo.

One Nation Under Beat debuted in the top 20 on the DAC-chart (Deutsch Alternative Chart) for eight weeks and peaked at number three.

In late spring of 2000 at a gig in Uddevalla, Sweden, Christian Lund joined the band as a live-member and went on stage with Andy and Seb for the first time. Along with being the vocalist for his En Route project, Christian had a background from a melodious EBM Fredrikstad-band called Elected By Fear where he played together with Fredrik Hansen from Echo Image (who also played at that gig) and Marius Johnsen from Centravibe.

===&quot;Serenity is the Devil&quot; (2000–2001)===

The year 2000 saw IOC&#x27;s first full-length release, &quot;Serenity is the Devil&quot;, in November 2000. The album peaked at number three on the DAC-chart and was ranked #16 on the DAC Top 50 Albums of 2000. After the album&#x27;s release, the band went to tour Germany together with Beborn Beton. With nine gigs, positive feedback from the audience and very good reviews on the debut album, IOC gained a following in the synth/industrial scene. The EP &quot;One Nation Under Beat&quot; was also released in 2000 and ranked #47 on the DAC Top 100 Singles chart for 2000.

Shortly afterward, the album crossed the Atlantic and was released in North America by Metropolis Records. On March 29, 2001, the band itself followed and boarded a plane to Chicago. The song &quot;Situations Like These&quot; from the (then) forthcoming &quot;Seren&quot; EP was played live for the first time to an American audience.

The summer started with a successful show in Leipzig, Germany, at Wave-Gotik-Treffen. The following festivals included CSD, Zillo Festival, Xtreaktor Festival, Eurorock, Infest and ended at M&#x27;era Luna.

&quot;Situations Like These&quot; became a big club hit and the band was ready for a second tour (this time in a Nightliner touring bus) of North America with VNV Nation. The leg began in Chicago on the 16th of November. Icon of Coil, VNV Nation and the rest of the crew continued up to Canada, down the east coast to Florida, through Texas to the West coast and Hollywood, where they did their 15th show. The four-week tour ended in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

===&quot;The Soul is in the Software&quot; (2002)===
During their tours, the band found the time to write material for their second album, &quot;The Soul is in the Software&quot;, which was released in April 2002 and stayed at number one on the DAC for several weeks. IOC then performed at two more festivals: The Dark Jubilee Festival in London, and later as the Sunday headliner for Synthpop Goes the World in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

===&quot;Machines Are Us&quot; (2004) and &quot;Uploaded And Remixed&quot; (2004)===
In 2004, their third album, &quot;Machines Are Us&quot;, was released. Icon of Coil then released their remix album &quot;Uploaded And Remixed&quot; at the tail end of 2004, which featured new mixes of songs from their first two records and two exclusive tracks.

===Present===
Icon of Coil have been reuniting sporadically for live performances. They announced at their recent Sydney show that they would be writing new material.

On August 6, 2012, Icon of Coil released a new song, &quot;PerfectSex&quot;, as a pay-what-you-want download on Bandcamp. The single release preceded a North American tour and started rumors of a new album. Most recently, in November 2015 IOC performed on the main stage at the Orus Fest in Mexico City.
In December 2018, Icon of Coil performed dates across Germany.

<doc id="1119143" wikidata="Q5224630" url="?curid=1119143" title="Darrell Glenn">
<text>Darrell Orvis Glenn (December 7, 1935 – April 9, 1990) was an American singer and songwriter. He first made his mark in the music business with his recording of &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; released in 1953, written by his father, Artie Glenn. He also wrote songs recorded by other artists including Elvis Presley.

== Early life ==
Darrel Glenn was born to Foy and Artie Glenn in 1935. The family moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where he attended J. P. Elder Junior High and Fort Worth Technical High School. He won a talent contest in Waco, Texas, where the award was an opportunity to record with Bob Wills. He released &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; when he was 17 before he graduated in June 1953.

== Career ==
His early recordings appeared on the Valley Records label out of Knoxville, Tennessee, produced by Floyd Wilson, who penned one of Glenn&#x27;s best recordings, &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Falling In Love With You&quot;. Glenn&#x27;s recording of &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; was originally recorded as a demo in professional studios in Ft. Worth, Texas, for the purpose of his father, Artie, to place the song with a publisher. The song was eventually accepted by Valley Publishers, who agreed to release the same demo recording as their first Valley Records release in 1953. The recording was too long to be released as a single, and a piano break was edited out, and the edited demo record was then released as the single. The song quickly became a hit. Glenn was still a student when the song was released, and after glenn graduated, he went on a tour in the United States and Canada. Later he also toured with Bob Hope.

&quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; was covered in the pop field by June Valli (RCA), Sonny Til &amp; the Orioles (Jubilee) in the R&amp;B field and some ten or so years later by Elvis Presley (RCA); all versions became major hits. In 1959, Glenn re-recorded &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; for National Recording Corporation as the title track of an album of inspirational songs. Background artists who appeared on Darrell Glenn&#x27;s NRC Records included Joe South, Ray Stevens, and Jerry Reed.

Glenn made regular appearances in &quot;Bewley Barn Dance&quot;, also appearing in the &quot;Big D Jamboree&quot;. He joined as vocalist a group called the Commodores, which had a local hit titled &quot;Uranium&quot; written by Glenn&#x27;s father Artie in 1955.

Glenn wrote a number of songs recorded by other artists; among these are the 1967 Elvis 45 release of &quot;Indescribably Blue&quot;, &quot;Bear With Me a Little Longer&quot; by Eddy Arnold; and &quot;Only the Redeemed&quot; by Kenneth Copeland, which received a Grammy nomination. He also wrote for an album of gospel songs by Copeland.

Glenn was co-owner of Glendale Records, and was also involved in other labels, including serving as the head of A&amp;R with Pompeii Records in 1968.

Glenn became an evangelist in the 1970s.

==Death==
Glenn died on April 9, 1990, from cancer in Fort Worth at the age of 54. He was buried in Bluebonnet Hills Memorial Park in Colleyville, Texas.

<doc id="1119144" wikidata="Q5132637" url="?curid=1119144" title="Cliff Island">
<text>Cliff Island is an island in Casco Bay, Maine, United States. It is part of the city of Portland. As of the 2000 census, the island had a year-round population of approximately 60 people. In the summer, the island&#x27;s population grows to about 200, despite the fact that it is the only year-round inhabited island in Casco Bay with no paved roads. The ZIP Code for Cliff Island is 04019.

In the early 20th century, the island&#x27;s inns were a draw for summer tourists. There are no longer any hotels, but many homes are available for weekly rentals or longer. While there are no public services, residents enjoy a community hall, a tennis court, baseball field, and playground. The residents are served by a USPS Post Office, fire department, and one-room school for elementary grades. While the postal service has considered closing the office in the past, the islanders have managed to keep it in operation for six hours a day.

==Transportation==
Cliff Island residents (also known as Cliff Islanders) travel back and forth to the mainland via the Casco Bay Lines ferry service. The ride takes about one hour. Cliff Islanders mostly buy groceries in Portland, but there is a small store on the island. In the summer, tourists taking the ferry as a cruise often step off to enjoy an ice-cream or pizza at the café.

Bicycles, golf carts and electric carts are most often used for transportation. A barge ramp was added in 2008 to ease delivery of trucks and heavy items.

==In popular culture==
In 1987 the feature film &quot;The Whales of August&quot; was filmed entirely on location on Cliff Island. The buoy that was used in the film as a transitioning tool is now on display outside of the Casco Bay Lines Ferry Terminal. The film was among the last for stars Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, Vincent Price, and Ann Sothern.

<doc id="1119145" wikidata="Q1090558" url="?curid=1119145" title="Château Lafite Rothschild">
<text>Château Lafite Rothschild is a French wine estate of Bordeaux wine, located in Pauillac in France, owned by members of the Rothschild family since the 19th century, and rated as a First Growth under the 1855 Bordeaux Classification.

Lafite was one of five wine-producing châteaux of Bordeaux originally awarded First Growth status in the 1855 Classification. Since then, it has been a consistent producer of one of the world&#x27;s most expensive red wines. A bottle of 1869 Château Lafite Rothschild holds the world record for the most expensive bottle of wine sold at auction for $233,973 in 2010.

==History==

Situated in the wine-producing village of Pauillac in the Médoc region to the north-west of Bordeaux, the estate was the property of Gombaud de Lafite in 1234. In the 17th century, the property of Château Lafite was purchased by the Ségur family, including the 16th century manor house that still stands. Although vines almost certainly already existed on the site, around 1680, Jacques de Ségur planted the majority of the vineyard.

In the early 18th century, Nicolas-Alexandre, marquis de Ségur refined the wine-making techniques of the estate, and introduced his wines to the upper echelons of European society. Before long he was known as the &quot;Wine Prince&quot;, and the wine of Château Lafite called &quot;The King&#x27;s Wine&quot; thanks to the influential support of the Maréchal de Richelieu. Towards the end of the 18th century, Lafite&#x27;s reputation was assured and even Thomas Jefferson visited the estate and became a lifelong customer.

Following the French Revolution, the period known as Reign of Terror led to the execution of Nicolas Pierre de Pichard on 30 June 1794, bringing an end to the Ségur family&#x27;s ownership of the estate which became public property. In 1797 the vineyards were sold to a group of Dutch merchants.

The first half of the 19th century saw Lafite in the hands of the Vanlerberghe family and the wine improved more, including the great vintages of 1795, 1798 and 1818. In 1868 the Château was purchased by Baron James Mayer Rothschild for 4.4 million francs, and the estate became Château Lafite Rothschild. Rothschild, however, died just three months after purchasing Lafite. The estate then became the joint property of his three sons: Alphonse, Gustave and Edmond Rothschild.

The 20th century has seen periods of success and difficulty, coping with post-phylloxera vines, and two world wars. During the Second World War the Château was occupied by the German army, and suffered heavily from plundering of its cellars. Succeeding his uncle Élie de Rothschild, Lafite has been under the direction of Éric de Rothschild from 1974 to 2018, when he was succeeded by his daughter, Saskia de Rothschild. She is the youngest woman leading a Premier Grand Cru Bordeaux estate.

At the 5 December 1985 Christie&#x27;s auction, a new record price of approximately was paid for a bottle of wine a 1787 Château Lafite which was thought to be owned by Thomas Jefferson. The authenticity of the bottle has been challenged. On 29 October 2010 the record was broken at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in Hong Kong three bottles of 1869 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild were sold for (US$232,692) each.

==Counterfeiting ==
In early November 2012, police in the city of Wenzhou, China, seized nearly 10,000 bottles of suspected counterfeit Château Lafite Rothschild. Lafite is very popular among China&#x27;s nouveau riche, but analysts suspect that between 50 and 70 per cent of wine labeled &quot;Château Lafite Rothschild&quot; in China is fake. If genuine, the collection seized in Wenzhou would have been worth up to US$16 million.

==Vineyard==

The vineyard is one of the largest in the Médoc at 107 hectares, and produces around 35,000 cases annually, of which between 15,000 and 25,000 are first growth. Its vines are around 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, and 2% Petit Verdot, whereas the final wine is between 80% and 95% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% and 20% Merlot, and up to 3% Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Occasionally exceptions are made, such as the 1961 vintage which was 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.

A second Château Lafite Rothschild vineyard was established in the Chinese province of Shandong, where 250,000 vine stocks from France are planted on 30 hectares. Its vines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Marselan. In 2019, the estate debuted its first vintage from its Domaine de Long Dai winery in Shandong.

==Wines==
In addition to the first growth, around a third of the wine is released as a second wine under the label &quot;Carruades de Lafite&quot;.
==Price==
Across all vintages Lafite Rothschild is one of the most expensive wines in the world, with the average price per 750 ml bottle reaching $911. Prices for Carruades de Lafite rose dramatically due in part to Chinese demand, with the prices of its 2005 and 2000 vintage fetching over £10,000 per case. After peaking in 2011, however, the price of some vintages halved in two years.

<text>John McGahern (12 November 1934 – 30 March 2006) was an Irish writer and novelist.

Known for the detailed dissection of Irish life found in works such as &quot;The Barracks&quot;, &quot;The Dark&quot; and &quot;Amongst Women&quot;, he was hailed by &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;the greatest living Irish novelist&quot; and in its obituary &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;arguably the most important Irish novelist since Samuel Beckett&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Dublin, John McGahern was initially raised at Corramahon, a townland located just over a mile east-north-east from the small town of Ballinamore in the south-east of County Leitrim. The eldest of seven (two sons and five daughters), he was raised alongside his siblings on the small farm at Corramahon. McGahern&#x27;s mother, Susan (&quot;née&quot; McManus), ran the farm (with some local help), while also maintaining a job as a primary school teacher at the local national school, Aughawillan National School. The school was located in the townland of Aughawillan, right beside Corramahon, just over a mile east-north-east from Ballinamore; Aughawillan townland is very close to County Leitrim&#x27;s boundary with the north-western part of neighbouring County Cavan. Susan and her family were local, the McManus family home being in the townland of Drumderg, right beside the townland of Corraleehan, a few miles north of Ballinamore. Drumderg townland is right beside County Cavan, with the county boundary between County Leitrim and County Cavan, and, therefore, the provincial boundary between Connacht and Ulster, running along the edge of the townland, Drumderg being on the Leitrim side of the county boundary. His father, Sergeant Francis (Frank) McGahern, was a native of Scrabby (later renamed Loch Gowna in 1950), a village on the shores of Lough Gowna in the west of County Cavan.

Sergeant Frank McGahern first met the then Susan McManus in 1924 in Ballinamore, when he was posted there, just after the Irish Civil War, as a &quot;garda&quot; with the Garda Síochána; she was working in the town as a primary school teacher at the time. Susan had trained as a teacher at Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), having won a scholarship to study there. Following her graduation, she had returned to her native South Leitrim. Frank and Susan finally married at St. Bridget&#x27;s Church at Corraleehan (also known as Corraleehan Chapel), near Ballinamore, in August 1932. Sergeant McGahern later served with the Garda Síochána in Cootehall, a village in the far north of County Roscommon, an area adjacent to South Leitrim, where he lived in Cootehall Garda Barracks, around twenty miles distant from his family. McGahern&#x27;s mother died of cancer in 1944, when John was 10, resulting in the uprooting of the McGahern children to their new home with their father in Cootehall Garda Barracks. Sgt. McGahern was quite a violent man, being physically abusive to his children.

In the years following his mother&#x27;s death, McGahern completed his primary schooling in the local primary school, and ultimately won a scholarship to the Presentation Brothers secondary school in Carrick-on-Shannon. Having travelled daily to complete his second-level education, McGahern continued to accumulate academic accolades by winning the county scholarship in his Leaving Certificate enabling him to continue his education to the third level.

McGahern was offered a place at St Patrick&#x27;s College of Education in Drumcondra where he trained to be a teacher. Upon graduation, he began his career as a primary school teacher at Scoil Eoin Báiste (Belgrove), a national school in Clontarf, where, for a period, he taught the academic Declan Kiberd. He returned to third-level education in University College, Dublin (UCD), where he graduated in 1957. He was dismissed from Scoil Eoin Báiste on the orders of The Most Rev. Dr John Charles McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin.

He was first published by the London literary and arts review, &quot;X&quot;, which published in 1961 an extract from his first – abandoned – novel, &quot;The End or Beginning of Love&quot;.

McGahern married his first wife, Finnish-born Annikki Laaksi, in 1965 and in the same year published his second novel, &quot;The Dark&quot;, which was banned by the Irish Censorship Board for its alleged pornographic content along with its implied sexual abuse by the protagonist&#x27;s father. Due to the controversy which was stirred by the book&#x27;s publication, McGahern was dismissed from his teaching post and forced to move to England where he worked in a variety of jobs, including on building sites, before returning to Ireland to live and work on a small farm that he bought near Fenagh, a village near Ballinamore, in the south-east of County Leitrim. The farm was located in the townland of Aughaboneill, just south of Foxfield and a short distance south-west of Fenagh.

McGahern divorced in 1969, and married Madeline Green in 1973.

He died from cancer in the Mater Hospital in Dublin on 30 March 2006, aged 71. He is buried in St Patrick&#x27;s Church, Aughawillan, alongside his mother.

==Novels==
McGahern&#x27;s six novels, drawing inspiration from personal life experience, detail the trials of developing a sense of self in mid-twentieth century Ireland.

===The early novels: &quot;The Barracks&quot; and &quot;The Dark&quot;===
His first published novel, &quot;The Barracks&quot; (1963), chronicles the life of the barracks&#x27; Garda sergeant&#x27;s second wife, Elizabeth Reegan, who is in declining health due to cancer. &quot;The Barracks&quot; was adapted for the stage in 1969 by Hugh Leonard.

His second book, &quot;The Dark&quot; (1965), tracks the progression of a young boy as he moves through the education system in rural Ireland. The main character, young Mahoney, while maintaining his academic prowess, experiences a strained relationship with his father, old Mahoney – who beats him and the other children – as well as indecision about what to do with his life after secondary school. Young Mahoney&#x27;s attitude towards his father evolves over the large timespan covered within the novel from fear and hatred towards greater acceptance.

Note: &quot;The Barracks&quot; and &quot;The Dark&quot; came from McGahern&#x27;s re-writing of his first, unpublished, novel, &quot;The End or Beginning of Love&quot;.

===Mid-career literature: &quot;The Leavetaking&quot; and &quot;The Pornographer&quot;===
The next novel, &quot;The Leavetaking&quot; (1975), introduces the reader to Patrick Moran, a young schoolteacher in Dublin. The novel is set during his last day in the school. He will be formally fired that night for having married a divorced non-Catholic woman during a leave of absence year. The novel is divided into two parts: both of which are essentially flashbacks. Part 1 covers the teacher&#x27;s childhood up to the moment of his mother&#x27;s death. Like McGahern himself, Patrick had promised his mother that he would become a priest and, as he is unable or unwilling to do so, instead becomes a schoolteacher (often referred to as &quot;the second priesthood&quot; in mid-twentieth century Ireland). Part 2 flashes back to how he came to meet his wife, how exactly the church authorities fired him, and his ultimate dismissal by the Catholic Church authorities, the formal authority within the vast majority of primary schools on the island of Ireland at the time. The book is a close reflection on McGahern&#x27;s own experience of being dismissed from his teaching post in the early 1960s for much the same reasons as Patrick Moran, as well as the scandal caused by his second book, &quot;The Dark&quot;, for its many sexual references.

&quot;The Pornographer&quot; (published in 1979) details the life of the novel&#x27;s protagonist who lives in Dublin and writes pornography for a living. He begins a sexual relationship with a young woman called Josephine, and when Josephine subsequently becomes pregnant, the &quot;pornographer&quot; voices his contempt towards the birth of the baby, and indeed his relationship with the child&#x27;s mother. As with McGahern&#x27;s previous novel, this work treats the subject of death by cancer – the protagonist&#x27;s aunt in this case is dying in hospital – as well as visits to rural Ireland.

===Back to the country: &quot;Amongst Women&quot; and &quot;That They May Face the Rising Sun&quot; (&quot;By The Lake&quot;)===
His fifth, and perhaps McGahern&#x27;s best-known, novel is &quot;Amongst Women&quot; (1990), which marks a return to the North Roscommon/South Leitrim setting after two Dublin/London books. It details the story of Michael Moran, an IRA veteran of the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, who now dominates his family in the unforgiving farmlands surrounding Mohill in the south of County Leitrim. The book shows a detailed and understanding portrayal of a hardened, and unapologetically idealistic, protagonist in the figure of an ageing Moran. An ex-IRA commander, Moran detests the &quot;small-minded gangsters&quot; who now run the country for which he fought. Though Moran&#x27;s presence surely dominates the novel, the positive attributes of his stern moralism and sense of self-worth are passed on to his children, who become successful adults (both emotionally and financially) in both Dublin and London alike. Once again, it seems to fit into a sequence, with the progressive male character most closely reflected by Luke, who left home, emigrated to London, and refuses to get close to his father again. One may view McGahern&#x27;s portrayal of the Moran household as the house he left behind with the remaining kids being brought up by his father, his father&#x27;s remarriage, and his young brother&#x27;s struggles with his father and school. In 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;Amongst Women&quot; as 97 in its list of the 100 best novels.

His final novel, &quot;That They May Face the Rising Sun&quot;, which was published in 2002 (published in the United States as &quot;By the Lake&quot;), is a portrait of a year in the life of a rural lakeside community. The novel explores the meaning of prosaic lives and life in (a now-past life) in rural Ireland. He said &quot;the ordinary fascinates me&quot; and &quot;the ordinary is the most precious thing in life&quot;. The main characters have – just like McGahern and his wife – returned from London to live on a farm. Most of the violence of the father figure has disappeared now, and life in the country seems much more relaxed and prosperous than in &quot;The Dark&quot; or &quot;Amongst Women&quot;, as McGahern now writes in a twenty-first century Ireland.

==Other writing==
Several collections of short stories by McGahern were published ,as well as &quot;Love of the World&quot;, a collection of non-fiction essays. His autobiography, &quot;Memoir&quot; (&quot;All Will be Well: a Memoir&quot; in the US), was published in 2005 a year before his death outlining influential moments in his life which critics often speculated were present within his earlier work. Andrew Motion wrote &quot;In a tremendously distinguished career, he has never written more movingly, or with a sharper eye&quot;.

==Influence==
McGahern&#x27;s work has been very influential in Ireland and elsewhere. A younger generation of Irish writers, such as Colm Tóibín, as well as contemporaries such as Eamonn McGrath, have been influenced by his writing.

His work has been translated into other languages, in particular French.

==Awards and honours==
McGahern was a member of the Irish Arts honorary organisation Aosdána and was appointed a &quot;Chevalier dans l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot;. He was visiting professor at Colgate University and the University of Notre Dame (United States), University of Victoria (Canada), Durham University (Great Britain), UCD and NUI Galway (Ireland).

<doc id="1119171" wikidata="Q510005" url="?curid=1119171" title="Acharonim">
<text>In Jewish law and history, Acharonim (, , ; ; ) are the leading rabbis and poskim (Jewish legal decisors) living from roughly the 16th century to the present, and more specifically since the writing of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (; a code of Jewish law) in 1563 CE.

The &quot;Acharonim&quot; follow the &quot;Rishonim&quot;, the &quot;first ones&quot;—the rabbinic scholars between the 11th and the 16th century following the &quot;Geonim&quot; and preceding the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. The publication of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; thus marks the transition from the era of Rishonim to that of Acharonim.

The Acharonim are thus contemporary with the Early Modern Period, the foundation of Hasidic Judaism, Jewish emancipation in Europe, the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment), Zionism, the Holocaust, the foundation of the State of Israel and the Jewish exodus from the Muslim world.

==Consequences for Halakhic change==

The distinction between the &quot;Acharonim&quot;, &quot;Rishonim&quot; and &quot;Geonim&quot; is meaningful historically. According to the widely held view in Orthodox Judaism, the Acharonim generally cannot dispute the rulings of rabbis of previous eras unless they find support from other rabbis in previous eras. Yet the opposite view exists as well: 
In &quot;The Principles of Jewish Law&quot; Orthodox Rabbi Menachem Elon wrote:
&quot;Hilkheta Ke-Vatra&#x27;ei&quot; can be interpreted such that the Orthodox view does not constitute a contradiction, with an appeal to understand it within the greater context of Torah. While authority may go to the scholars of a later generation &quot;within&quot; a particular era, the Talmud does not allow scholars of a later era to argue with scholars of an &quot;earlier&quot; era without support from other scholars of an earlier era.

This is displayed in “hundreds of instances&quot; in the Talmud in which Amora’im are challenged by Tanna’itic sources with the term מיתיבי and the Amorai&#x27;m unable to “deflect the challenge”. An Amora called Rav is challenged by Tannai’tic sources “and is vindicated by the statement, &quot;Rav tanna hu upalig”-&quot; “Rav is a Tanna and disagrees (in &quot;Eiruvin&quot; 50b, &quot;Kesubos&quot; 8a, and elsewhere). A similar case exists for Rav Chiya, a borderline Tanna in &quot;Bava Metzia&quot; 5a&quot;.&quot; This clearly implies that the only reason they are able to get away with disagreeing is because they are Tannaim. There are “only a handful of possible exceptions [to the rule] that the &quot;Amora’im&quot; did not, in fact argue with the &quot;Tanna’im.”&quot; 

The question of which prior rulings can and cannot be disputed has led to attempts to precisely define which rulings are within the Acharonim era. According to many rabbis the Shulkhan Arukh is from an Acharon. Some hold that Rabbi Yosef Karo&#x27;s &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; has the halakhic status of a work of a Rishon, while his later &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot; has the status of a work of an Acharon.

<text>Sliding scale fees are variable prices for products, services, or taxes based on a customer&#x27;s ability to pay. Such fees are thereby reduced for those who have lower incomes, or alternatively, less money to spare after their personal expenses, regardless of income. Sliding scale fees are a form of price discrimination or differential pricing.

A business or organization may have various motivations for pricing a product or service on a sliding scale. These may include the desire to be charitable to those less able to afford the product or service, their ability to get a tax deduction for offering their services as charity, their ability to benefit from the revenue even from a partial payment, their retention of a longtime customer/client, or referrals that such a customer/client may provide.

For example, healthcare providers sometimes offer a sliding scale of fees to patients. Some child-adoption agencies collect legal fees (normally very expensive) on a sliding scale, so that couples across a wider range of incomes are able to adopt children. Sliding-scale fees are also often charged by lawyers, places of worship, and for tuition at educational institutions.

<text>Chebeague Island is located in Casco Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Maine. It was originally used as a fishing ground by Abenaki Native Americans. Also known as Great Chebeague (pronounced &quot;sha-big&quot;) Island, today it is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. It is located northeast of Portland, Maine. Chebeague Island is the largest island in Casco Bay that is not connected to the mainland by a bridge. The largest island is Sebascodegan, or &quot;Great Island,&quot; which is part of the Town of Harpswell and connected to the mainland via a 100 ft bridge.

Chebeague Island is one of the twelve major islands of the Calendar Islands, a term that originated in 1700 with the report by the English military engineer Wolfgang William Römer, who claimed there were &quot;as many islands as there are days in the year.&quot; As a corrective, the Maine State Historian Robert M. York stated there are &quot;little more than two hundred islands&quot; in Casco Bay.

Chebeague Island was a part of the Town of Cumberland until July 1, 2007, when it seceded and became the Town of Chebeague Island. The Town of Chebeague Island includes seventeen islands and their adjacent waters. These include the islands of Bangs, Bates, Hope, Ministerial, Sand, Stave, Stockman, and the tiny Upper Green Islands.

At the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s year-round population was 396. The population is said to more than triple in the summer months.

Chebeague Island is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

According to island lore, the name &quot;Chebeague&quot; evolved from Chebiscodego, the name used by members of the Wabanaki Confederacy, a First Nations and Native American confederation of five principal nations: the Mi&#x27;kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki, and Penobscot. The most accepted definition of the word Chebeague is &quot;Island of Many Springs.&quot; Other sources state that Chebeague comes from the Abenaki words T’Cabie or Chebidisco, meaning cold spring, or Jabeque or Gaboag, meaning separated, which recognizes the connectedness of Great Chebeague Island and Little Chebeague Island. Great Chebeague Island was also known for a time as Recompense Island.

The early Native American presence on the island was not year-round. During the summer months, Native Americans arrived by canoe to fish and gather shellfish for the winter months.

Early settlers included Zachariah Chandler, who bought 650 acres in 1746. Other early settlers were Ambrose Hamilton and Deborah Soule Hamilton, who had fourteen children and seventy-two grandchildren, the majority of whom settled on Chebeague. The early white settlers cleared much of the island&#x27;s land for farming. Lobsters were so plentiful that they were used as fertilizer for the fields.

Early commerce on the island developed around fishing, farming, and the construction of &quot;stone sloops,&quot; ships that carried quarried granite down the eastern seaboard for the building of breakwaters, lighthouses, and set navigational markers.

By the late 19th century and throughout the early 20th century, tourists from Canada, Boston, and points south began to visit Maine in a phenomenon sometimes known as the &quot;rusticators&quot; movement, where residents of New England&#x27;s industrial cities sought to get back to nature for a few days or weeks. The tourists filled the cottages, rooming houses, and inns, such as the Chebeague Island Inn, that dotted the islands of Casco Bay. In 1900, Chebeague Island had five hotels. Tourists arrived on steamboats from Portland.

The Chebeague High School closed in 1956; the schoolhouse, built in 1871, still stands and serves as a museum for Great Chebeague&#x27;s history. The strong sense of community is highlighted in its summer months, where children often participate in the many camps offered on the island. Popular are the farm camp, clown camp, British Soccer Camp, theatre camp, and many others sponsored by the island&#x27;s recreation center. Among the most popular is the Chebeague Island Sailing School, created by the island&#x27;s yacht club. In the acclaimed camp, students learn about small boat sailing while enjoying the great waters that Casco Bay offers.

Nearby Cousins Island is connected to the mainland by a bridge, and Great Chebeague has historically debated and entertained the idea of linking-up to the mainland or Cousins Island with a bridge of its own. The idea of building a bridge was last considered seriously in 1970, but was soundly voted down by islanders.

In 1997, the people of Chebeague were a significant part of a movement that managed to overturn Nabisco&#x27;s first attempt at discontinuing the &quot;Crown Pilot Crackers&quot; from its product line. Due to its being such a tradition with the islanders as an accessory to their consumption of soup, an organized effort was created to bring the chowder cracker back. It was successful, so much so that not only was the Pilot Cracker made again, but it was turned into a media event, with Nabisco donating $1,000 to the Chebeague Historical Society. The cracker was ultimately cancelled however—this time for good—in 2008.

In 2002 Chebeague Island explored secession from Cumberland, with whom they had been tied for 184 years. The initiative gained traction after school district 51 considered downsizing the island elementary school. The island won independence from Cumberland after votes in the Maine Senate (31–3) and House of Representatives (131–1) on April 5, 2006. The separation took effect on July 1, 2007.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

At approximately long and wide, Chebeague is the largest unconnected island in Casco Bay. The northern tip of the island is called Chebeague Point and the southern tip is called Deer Point.

===Little Chebeague===

Chebeague Island is known as &quot;Great Chebeague,&quot; as it is not always a single landmass. The nearby island of &quot;Little Chebeague&quot; is accessible on foot, via a sandbar that appears at low tide.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 341 people, 171 households, and 98 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 525 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 99.1% White, 0.3% African American, 0.3% Asian, and 0.3% from two or more races.

There were 171 households, of which 18.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.1% were married couples living together, 5.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 2.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 42.7% were non-families. 37.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 19.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.99 and the average family size was 2.63.

The median age in the town was 57.9 years. 15% of residents were under the age of 18; 4% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 14.1% were from 25 to 44; 32% were from 45 to 64; and 34.9% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the town was 48.4% male and 51.6% female.

==Transportation==

Transportation to the island includes two ferry services. Chebeague Transportation Company&#x27;s (CTC) ferry, the &quot;Independence&quot;, makes the 15-minute run from Wharf Road on Cousins Island to the Stone Wharf on the north-west side of the island. Casco Bay Lines provides service on all mail boat and other &quot;down-bay&quot; trips that travel beyond Long Island.

One main macadam-paved road (with various different names, including North Road and South Road) loops around the island, with a few connecting paved or partly-paved roads in between, such as Schoolhouse Road, Roy Hill Road, and Littlefield Avenue. Coming off the paved road, there are many unpaved roads going to residential homes and various points and beaches. The beaches are considered state land and anyone can walk on them, like state park property, thus the reason many of the smaller roads simply end at coastal points. Some of smaller &quot;roads&quot; are merely single-lane, rutted sand trails with heavy overgrowth to either side, and on the off-chance two cars meet coming at one another, one car must pull to the side or back up to a suitable area to allow the other to pass. Most residents have &quot;island cars&quot; that they use year-round; they take the abuse of rutted back roads with overgrowth that scratches the sides of vehicles, as well as the corrosive, briny Casco Bay air. Island cars are not required to have license plates, although they must be registered.

Children of year-round residents take a boat back and forth to the mainland every day from the Stone Pier to go to middle and high school. Elementary-school-age children usually stay on the island to attend the school house, which houses grades K–5.
== Wildlife and nature ==

Deer, red fox, a variety of non-venomous snakes, raccoons, grey squirrels, frogs and toads, gray and black back gulls, loons, and ducks are all creatures that can be seen on and about the island. Curiously, no skunks are to be found on this, the second largest island in Casco Bay. Mosquitoes can be a nuisance, and much of the island is soft, sandy, swampy soil (due largely in part to the many underground springs), which are perfect conditions for mosquito breeding.

Harbor seals can often be spotted from the shores of Chebeague, swimming or sunning themselves on the rocks of nearby uninhabited islands or on depth-marker buoys. Occasionally one might spot a porpoise breaking surface as well. Lobsters and lobstering are a big part of Casco Bay, and the ocean surrounding Chebeague is dotted by thousands of lobster pot buoys, the livelihood of many year-round residents in the area. Lobstering is a big commodity of Casco Bay. Locals often fish from the docks and piers for mackerel, bluefish, or striped bass, just a few of many abundant fish in the area, and crab traps hang from the docks.
=== Blueberries ===
All over the island, as Maine is often known for, are blueberry patches that supply an abundant amount of blueberries, ardently picked by the locals. However, they are slowly decreasing in size as land development continues.

=== Clamming and red tide ===

The many inlet coves around the island are home to abundant clam beds. During low tide, these fully exposed areas can be walked on and are often clammed by the locals, some of whom have made a living for decades harvesting steamers, hen clams, and razor clams from the muddy, clay-rich soil. Clamming is often shut down when the red tide—a harmful microscopic ocean organism that affects shellfish—&quot;blooms&quot; in the area. People who eat clams that are affected by the red tide (even steamed ones) can become violently ill; the algae can be fatal. This paralytic poisoning often causes death to humans, birds, larval and adult fish, and marine mammals.

For many years, mussels—which grow in clusters, attached by &quot;beards&quot; to rocks and seaweed, pier pilings, buoys, and just about any stable structure in the ocean—were largely ignored as inedible. But during the 1980s and early 1990s, when clams were getting more difficult to acquire, mussels began to be considered good eating. Some consider these mollusks a bit more &quot;gamey&quot; in taste compared to clams but quite similar otherwise. Mussels can be reaped in much larger quantities, very quickly.

Clams have to be dug out of the sand, by hand, with an angled pick; they very often withdraw deeper into their sand tunnel when they &quot;hear&quot; someone digging for them. This makes harvesting clams a backbreaking task. The clam shell may be broken during this procedure, ruining it. Mussels, on the other hand, are lying attached to rocks on the shore during low tide, and a bucketful can be collected in minutes. Marketing demands have reduced the mussel population greatly, and now they are often &quot;grown&quot; by farmers on floating barges where they can be easily &quot;picked&quot; when ready.

== Ocean geography, tides, and weather ==

Typically Great Chebeague has tides under normal conditions. Ocean floor geography in the general area can vary drastically, thus careful navigation must be practiced when boating, even in small vessels. Many islands, including Great Chebeague, have extended rock outcroppings that are completely underwater during high tide, but may be lurking just below the surface as the tide drops, and may appear out of the water during low tide. The rip tide can be several knots, and rowing against it is physically impossible: Extra care must be taken when venturing out in small watercraft. Even on the clearest day, a thick fog can suddenly &quot;roll in&quot; out of nowhere, reducing visibility to zero.

Even during the warmest summer months, the ocean temperature is barely above . Falling out of a boat into the water anytime between September and April can be dangerous, if not fatal, depending on the time of year. Swimming is enjoyed usually in inlets and coves where the water temperature is slightly higher, and off the pier or docks. Like most islands in the area, Chebeague has as much rocky cliffs for a shoreline as beaches. The &quot;Niblic&quot; beach by the boatyard and Deer Point by Chandler&#x27;s Cove are popular beaches for their soft stretch of sand. On a clear day at Deer Point, one can see Mount Washington in New Hampshire. When the sun goes down, temperatures can drop drastically and, even on the warmest summer days, nights are often very cool and can require long sleeves and pants and even a fire in the fireplace. Winters can be brutal, and usually by September, most of the non-year-round residents are packed up and gone.

== Services and stores ==

Chebeague Island has its own post office. There is cell phone service on the island.

The Town of Chebeague Island has a webpage that provides access to town documents, a town calendar, and other information.

There is one school on the island which has classes Pre-K through 5th grade. Students in sixth grade and older attend schools on the mainland. Sixth through eighth graders attend Frank H. Harrison Middle School in Yarmouth and ninth graders to seniors attend Yarmouth High School.

The Chebeague Island Boatyard provides a variety of services ranging from indoor heated storage and nightly mooring rentals to portable marine engine diagnostics and fabricating or refinishing woodwork. In the summer months, a gift store, the Niblic, is open at the Boatyard.

The Chebeague Island Methodist Church is the island&#x27;s oldest institution and the island&#x27;s only church. Its roots extend back into the 18th century when Methodist missionaries visited Casco Bay. The island matriarch was &quot;excommunicated&quot; from the Congregational Church when she joined the Methodists. They held class meetings and built a small meetinghouse. In 1814 nearly all of the 19 members were connected to the Hamiltons. As Chebeague&#x27;s population grew, the need for a new church became apparent. In 1855 a schism about the location occurred. As a result, two Methodist churches were built within sight of each other. When the Methodist Protestant Church closed around 1890, they were welcomed back to the Methodist Episcopal. A new parsonage was built in 1885–1886 and has housed many pastors and their families. Today, the church has left the Methodist denomination and is led by chaplain Victor Diaz.

The local historical museum run by the Chebeague Island Historical Society is open during the summer months. The Chebeague Island Library is open year-round.

Second Wind Farm, run by Charles Varney, provides islanders with locally-grown produce during the season.

The Chebeague Island Inn and restaurant is open in the summer, as is a nine-hole golf course, a tennis club, and two gift shops, the Niblic, located at the Boatyard, and Island Riches, located near the landing for the Casco Bay Ferry.

There is a full-time volunteer fire station and EMTs/ambulance.

Police matters are handled by Cumberland County Sheriff officers. If there is a medical emergency, one must be taken to the mainland via the ambulance and ferry, which are always on call.

<doc id="1119176" wikidata="Q266782" url="?curid=1119176" title="Combichrist">
<text>Combichrist is an American aggrotech / industrial metal band formed in 2003 by Norwegian vocalist Andy LaPlegua, who also founded the bands Icon of Coil, Panzer AG, Scandinavian Cock and Scandy. Combichrist was formed in Atlanta, Georgia. The band consists of only LaPlegua in the studio, with a changing lineup of live performing members. Releases by the band have been very successful in terms of sales and charted in top positions for dance and alternative charts worldwide.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
The first material that LaPlegua wrote for the project was a power noise/techno crossover track &quot;Thanx to my Buddies&quot; under the moniker &quot;D.r.i.v.E&quot; for the Advanced Electronics Vol. 2 compilation. The song was later remade into &quot;Like to Thank My Buddies&quot; on Combichrist&#x27;s album &quot;Everybody Hates You&quot;. The project&#x27;s name was later changed to &quot;Hudlager&quot; and then finally to Combichrist before the debut album &quot;The Joy of Gunz&quot; was released on the German record label Out of Line.
The band name came from a fanzine of LaPlegua&#x27;s in the 1990s, with Combichrist being a character in it that was a &quot;punk-rock messiah&quot;. The character would go on drug and alcohol fueled rampages, later healing those whom he had beaten. A few years after the band&#x27;s conception, LaPlegua departed Norway for the United States, which is now the current home-base for Combichrist and his other projects Scandy, Panzer AG, and Scandinavian Cock.

===&quot;The Joy of Gunz&quot; (2003–2005)===
Combichrist&#x27;s first LP &quot;The Joy of Gunz&quot; was released in 2003. Sporting a fresh, original and aggressive new sound the brainchild of LaPlegua took the crowds by storm. On Halloween of the same year, the limited edition EP &quot;Kiss The Blade&quot; was released with 667 pressings which sold out in less than a week. In 2004, the second EP, &quot;Sex, Drogen Und Industrial&quot;, spent several weeks at number one in the DAC charts. At the same time that &quot;Sex, Drogen Und Industrial&quot; was released, a limited edition of 666 white-vinyl 12&quot; pressings for &quot;Blut Royale&quot; were produced, and sold out quickly.

=== &quot;Everybody Hates You&quot; (2005–2006) ===
The year 2005 saw the release of &quot;Everybody Hates You&quot; and it was at this time that LaPlegua began labeling the music as &quot;Techno Body Music&quot; or TBM. The band released a song called &quot;This Is TBM&quot; on the Masterhit Recordings compilation &quot;This Is... Techno Body Music Vol. 1&quot;. They played this song live during their 2005 shows, adding vocals to it. No vocal version of the instrumental track was ever released, and the lyrics were instead later reworked for the track &quot;Electrohead&quot;. After this release, LaPlegua stopped referring to their music as TBM. Shortly after the release of the album, Army On The Dance Floor producer Kourtney Klein was added as alternating keyboardist and drummer to the band. The full-length album featured two tracks that became club classics &quot;This Shit Will Fuck You Up&quot; and &quot;This Is My Rifle&quot; and it was also the project&#x27;s U.S. debut on Metropolis Records. Further benchmarks were set with the release of the 2006 EP &quot;Get Your Body Beat&quot; the title track of which landed Combichrist its first appearance on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 10 Dance Singles chart. The music video for the single was included on the DVD release of the biopunk film &quot;The Gene Generation&quot; with the song also being used in the movie. The band embarked on a North American tour with KMFDM soon after the release of the single.

===&quot; What the Fuck Is Wrong with You People?&quot; (2007–2009) ===
On March 6, 2007, &quot;What the Fuck Is Wrong with You People?&quot; was released to some critical praise and popularity. The album featured 2006&#x27;s break out single &quot;Get Your Body Beat&quot;, it had an explosive barrage of corrosive beats, leering vocals, and acidic melodies. &quot;WTFIWWYP?&quot; was a high energy, adrenaline charged piece of sonic battery. Combichrist played on the Gothic Cruise in 2008, and released a limited CDr EP only available to ticket-holders. Limited to 200 copies, it contains seven tracks, of which six are exclusive.

=== &quot;Today We Are All Demons&quot; (2009–2010) ===
Pull Out Kings producer and songwriter Z. Marr joined the band as keyboardist in January 2008 to begin work on the album Today We Are All Demons. According to an exchange with a fan, Trevor Friedrich of Imperative Reaction and formerly of Eighteen Visions, he was asked to join the band as a drummer with Joe Letz (of Wednesday 13) in October 2008. He replaced keyboardist Kourtney Klein, who began full-time work with Nitzer Ebb.

Combichrist released &quot;Today We Are All Demons&quot; on January 20, 2009. Combichrist immediately went on a highly successful North American tour with Black Light Burns (featuring Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit) and an extensive European tour with Rammstein. For part the European tour that year, Trevor was temporarily replaced by Mark Jackson of VNV Nation. Combichrist&#x27;s song &quot;Shut Up and Bleed&quot; featuring W.A.S.T.E was put on the soundtrack for the horror movie &quot;The Collector&quot;. Their song &quot;&quot;Today We Are All Demons&quot; (Beneath the World Mix)&quot; was put on the soundtrack for the movie .

===&quot;Making Monsters&quot; (2010–2014) ===
Combichrist&#x27;s album, &quot;Making Monsters&quot;, was released digitally on August 31, 2010, and on CD on September 28, 2010. Combichrist began a tour in support of the new album in late 2010, with Aesthetic Perfection and iVardensphere as the support bands. In 2011, after opening for Rammstein at Madison Square Garden in December 2010, both bands announced Combichrist would be supporting Rammstein on their North American tour and LaPlegua announced the &quot;Monsters on Tour Part II&quot; taking place around the scheduled Rammstein shows. The &quot;Monsters on Tour Part II&quot; had the same support as the 2010 tour but with the additions of Angel Spit and God Module performing with them on select dates.

Combichrist&#x27;s music was prominently featured in the hack-n-slash style video game &quot;DmC Devil May Cry&quot;. Their track &quot;Never Surrender&quot; was featured in a gameplay demo, and Throat Full of Glass is played during the opening sequence. LaPlegua was heavily involved in the game&#x27;s soundtrack.

A new song called &quot;Bottle of Pain&quot; was released in January 2012 for the movie soundtrack.

=== &quot;We Love You&quot; (2014–2016) ===
In October 2013, LaPlegua announced on Facebook that there would be a new album on the way in 2014. On December 10, 2013, Combichrist announced the title of their 7th studio album, We Love You, with a March 2014 release date. The We Love You promo tour, included acts from William Control and New Years Day. Two singles were released from this album, &quot;From My Cold Dead Hands&quot; and &quot;Maggots at the Party&quot;. The video for Maggots at the Party has been nominated by Berlin Music Video Awards for 2015 Most Trashy Video.

=== &quot;This Is Where Death Begins&quot; (2016) ===
This Is Where Death Begins is the eighth studio album. It was released on June 3, 2016. The album sees the band moving further away from their original electronic sound towards rock and metal.

===&quot; Make Europe Great Again (M.E.G.A) Tour&quot; and &quot;This Is Where Death Begins&quot; (2016) ===
In February 2016, it was announced that the new album (as yet untitled, but often hashtagged #ThisIsWhereITBegins on Instagram posts about it) will be released in May. LaPlegua and the band&#x27;s official Instagram pages posted snippets, clips, and hinted at guest artists – possibly some of Coal Chamber and Filter, and the female singer of MXMS. A full European tour is planned for June and July, with Nick Rossi (ex-New Years Day) joining the live line-up as a second drummer/percussionist. Meanwhile, the band&#x27;s first show of the year – the Out Of Line Festival in Berlin – saw them perform without long-time keyboardist Z. Marr, who has left the band to pursue other interests (in June 2016 it was revealed he has joined &lt;PIG&gt;.) He was replaced by Elliott Berlin, of Aesthetic Perfection and Telemark, who has previously played keys for an &quot;Old-School&quot; Combichrist show and toured extensively as their show tech. Nick Rossi will be playing live keys on the forthcoming tour, in addition to his drumming duties – much as Shaun Frandsen did on the 2012 Evolution Tour.

On April 9, LaPlegua played a solo show at Complex, in Glendale, CA, which was a rare outing of the early instrumental incarnation of the band. The set list included tracks like Brain Bypass, Adult Content, Without Emotions, God Bless, Bulletfuck, Spit, God Wrapped In Plastic, The Kill (Instru-mental Version from &quot;The Frost EP&quot;), God Warrior, and other rarely or never played techno/noise tracks.
Of the evening, LaPlegua said: &quot;It was a rarity show, and I played the show exactly like I did back in the days when it was just me. No point playing obvious songs, when I can do those songs on any given show. I was happy to play all those songs I can never do with the full band, and I could have done a million more. Thanks to everyone coming out last night. I had a blast doing an old school set like this. For those who missed it; I will never do it again, so you missed out. To those who were there, thanks for sharing this night with me.&quot;

On April 18, it was announced that the new album will be called &quot;This Is Where Death Begins&quot; with a release date of June 3, 2016. Available on double vinyl and CD, a two-CD version includes a live recording of the Complex, LA, show. A three-CD and DVD version includes audio and video from the Summer Breeze Festival in 2015, making this the band&#x27;s first official live release.

===&quot;One Fire&quot; (2019) ===
Following the 2017 release of standalone track &quot;Broken : United&quot;, a new album called &quot;One Fire&quot; was scheduled for a Spring release, delayed from Fall 2018, followed by a US tour in March/April and European shows (some festival, some headline) in June, July, August. Joe Letz announced his departure on January 17, after 13 years as main drummer, ahead of official album/tour announcements and in line with his new sober lifestyle. LaPlegua posted a farewell statement, confirming that &quot;Joe&#x27;s departure has nothing to do with the band itself. It is about recovery, a different life and spending more time with his family.&quot; LaPlegua added that he/Combichrist has &quot;new management, new booking agency, Nick Rossi and Eric 13 working hard with me, Elliot Berlin on keyboards and a new second drummer Will Spodnick.&quot;

=== 2020 &amp; Beyond ===
LaPlegua set up a Combichrist Patreon, where he posted some exclusive unreleased Scandy tracks and &quot;Sec Four&quot; which was used in DMC game trailers but never released. During 2020, he continued working on new Combichrist material for a 2022 album - beginning with the single &quot;Not My Enemy&quot; released early 2021 - and confirmed that Elliott Berlin has rejoined the band as a recording and touring member. In addition, the first official solo album will be released under the name LaPlegua - containing some songs that were originally destined for a third Panzer AG album. First single, &quot;I Will Heal&quot; was released online in February 2021, with the post-punk/goth rock album pencilled for a summer release. New material from Icon Of Coil is also in the works, as is a new project of Viking techno which will come out under the name HDLGIR. Meanwhile, the podcast &quot;Oh Weird! It&#x27;s Combichrist and Co!&quot; began recording in early 2021, featuring LaPlegua and his sound/lights crew, Greg Gory and Chris Norris, often with special guests. The band hope to resume touring in late summer (Europe) and autumn/fall (USA) 2021, however guitarist Eric13 would be sitting it out with Jamie Cronander filling in for him. On September 15, 2021, the new single &quot;Compliance&quot; was released, accompanied by a lyric video. On May 13, 2022, another new single &quot;Modern Demon&quot; was released.

==Band members==

Combichrist was originally just LaPlegua onstage, followed by LaPlegua plus one other 2003–2006. The lineup then changed and expanded to include Shaun F, Jon Horton, and Joe Letz. Combichrist has existed and played as a solo act, a duo, a trio, a quartet, a quintet, and on occasion has played shows with six members. The Past Members include full and touring members of the band, while the Guest Members includes special appearances for one or two shows only. Elliott Berlin, for example, guested on keys for an old-school show (Glasgow) and on keys with the full band when Z_Marr quit (Berlin), before becoming a full touring member in 2018.

<text>Mary Lu Zahalan (25 October 1958 – 27 May 2023) was a Canadian rock singer and actress.

Born in Renfrew, Ontario, and raised in Oakville, Zahalan was a Miss Canada finalist in 1975 before embarking on a career as an entertainer. She had entered the contest as a class project while taking a personal improvement class at Sheridan College to overcome her shyness; what she ultimately took away from the competition was an interest in the theatrical production aspects of the experience, so she then enrolled in the college&#x27;s musical theatre program.

She released her debut album, &quot;Think of Me&quot;, in 1982, and received a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Female Vocalist at the Juno Awards of 1983. 

In 1985 she performed vocals on &quot;Visible&quot;, the final album by rock band CANO, and toured with the band to promote the album. In this era, she also had various acting roles in musical theatre.

In 1990, she released the album &quot;Zahalan&quot; on MCA Records, and enjoyed moderate success with the single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget About You&quot; on Canadian radio.

She later returned to Sheridan College as a music teacher. She also had supporting roles in film and television, including in the television films &quot;Woman on the Run: The Lawrencia Bembenek Story&quot; and &quot;Alley Cats Strike&quot;.

In January 2011, Zahalan graduated from Liverpool Hope University with a master&#x27;s degree in a program that studied the Beatles. She was the first graduate of the program. She subsequently directed &quot;Becoming the Beatles&quot;, a live musical documentary about the history of the Beatles.

On 27 May 2023, Zahalan passed away from cancer at the age of 66.

<text>Herman VI (c. 1226 – 4 October 1250) was Margrave of Baden and titular margrave of Verona from 1243 until his death.

A descendant of the Swabian House of Zähringen, he was the son of Margrave Herman V and Irmengard, daughter of Count Palatine Henry V of the Rhine. He succeeded his father in Baden on 16 January 1243.

In 1248, he married Gertrude of Austria, the niece of the last male member of the Babenberg dynasty, Duke Frederick II of Austria (1230–1246), and on the basis of that marriage claimed the duchies of Austria and Styria, leaving the rule over Baden to his younger brother Rudolf. However, he had a mighty rival in King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who in 1252 married Frederick&#x27;s sister Margaret to legitimize his claims. According to the &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot; issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1156, the Austrian lands could be bequeathed in the female line, and Herman even obtained the explicit consent by Pope Innocent IV. Nevertheless, the margrave and his son Frederick could not establish themselves in Austria and Styria against the resistance of the local nobility, who preferred Ottokar. Both rivals finally did not prevail, as the duchies were seized as reverted fiefs by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany after Ottokar&#x27;s death at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278.

==Family==
The Margrave and his wife had the following children:

*Frederick I (born 1249, died 1268).
*Agnes (born 1250, died 1295), married firstly Ulrich III, Duke of Carinthia and secondly Count Ulrich of Heunberg.

<text>Little Diamond Island is an island in Casco Bay, Maine, United States. It is part of the city of Portland. 

The island was formerly known as Little Hog Island. It is mostly made up of private property, and it is a vacation destination. It can be accessed by ferry from the mainland.

As of the 2000 census, the island had a year-round population of five. There are few permanent residents because the water supply is turned off during the winter.

<doc id="1119188" wikidata="Q2811650" url="?curid=1119188" title="Signal passed at danger">
<text>A signal passed at danger (SPAD) is an event on a railway where a train passes a stop signal without authority. This is also known as , in the United States as a stop signal overrun (SSO) and in Canada as passing a stop signal. SPAD is defined by Directive 2014/88/EU as any occasion when any part of a train proceeds beyond its authorised movement. Unauthorised movement means to pass:
* &quot;a trackside colour light signal or semaphore at danger, or an order to STOP where a Train Protection system (TPS) is not operational,&quot; 
* &quot;the end of a safety related movement authority provided in a TPS,&quot; 
* &quot;a point communicated by verbal or written authorisation laid down in regulations,&quot; 
* &quot;stop boards (buffer stops are not included) or hand signals.&quot;

==Etymology==

The name derives from red colour light signals and horizontal semaphore signals in the United Kingdom, which are said to be &quot;at danger&quot; when they indicate that trains must stop (also known as the signal being &quot;on&quot;). This terminology is not used in North America where not all red signals indicate stop. In the UK, a signal passed at red (SPAR) is used where a signal changes to red directly in front of a train, due to a fault or emergency, meaning it is impossible to stop before the signal.

==Causes==
The high inertia of trains, and the low adhesion between the wheels and track, means it takes a long distance for the train brakes to stop a train. SPADs are most commonly a small overrun of the signal (instead of a long overrun), because the driver has braked too late. The safety consequences for these types of SPADs may be minor. On the other hand, some SPADs involve the driver being unaware they have passed a signal at danger and continue until notified by network controllers, or a collision occurs, as in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash.

The causes and prevention of SPADs is actively researched. Causes of SPADs are always multidimensional. Some of the causes of SPADs are:

*Misjudgement
*Environmental conditions
*Inattention
*Distraction
*Fatigue
*Misreading of an adjacent signal due to line curvature (a “crossread”), or sighting on one beyond
*Misunderstanding
*Miscommunication
*Incomplete or lapsed route knowledge
*Acute medical condition (medical emergency), such as a heart attack or stroke
*Chronic medical condition, such as sleep apnea causing microsleep
* Driver deviation from standard operating procedures
* False assumptions based on familiarity and past situations
* Poor change management practices
* Failure to properly assess competencies

== Prevention ==

=== Automatic train protection ===
Automatic train protection (ATP) is an advanced form of train stop which can regulate the speed of trains in situations other than at a signal set at danger. ATP can supervise speed restrictions and distance to danger points. It can also take into account individual train characteristics such as brake performance etc. Therefore ATP can determine when brakes should be applied in order to stop the train before passing a signal at danger. Presently, In the UK, only a small percentage of trains (Great Western Railway and Chiltern Railways) are fitted with this equipment.

=== Driver&#x27;s reminder appliance ===
The driver&#x27;s reminder appliance (DRA) is an inhibiting switch located on the driver&#x27;s desk of United Kingdom passenger trains designed specifically to prevent &quot;starting away SPADs&quot;. The driver is required to operate the DRA whenever the train is brought to a stand, either after passing a signal displaying caution or at a signal displaying danger.

Once applied, the DRA displays a red light and prevents traction power from being taken until the DRA is manually cancelled by the driver.

==Collision prevention systems==
Whilst the ideal safety system would prevent a SPAD from occurring, most equipment in current use does not stop the train before it has passed the Danger signal. However, provided that the train stops within the designated overlap beyond that signal, a collision should not occur.

=== Train stops ===
On the London Underground (for example), mechanical train stops are fitted beside the track at signals to stop a train, should a SPAD occur.

Train stops are also installed on main line railways in places where tripcock equipped trains run in extensive tunnels, such as the on the Northern City Line where the Automatic warning system and Train Protection &amp; Warning System are not fitted.

===Automatic Warning System===
On the UK mainline, AWS consists of an on-board receiver/timer connected to the emergency braking system of a train, and magnets located in the center of the track. At each AWS site, a permanent magnet arms the system and an electromagnet connected to the green signal lamp disarms the system and a confirming chime is provided to the driver. If the receiver does not disarm within one second after arming, a warning tone sounds at the driver&#x27;s desk and if it is not cancelled by the driver, the emergency brakes will be activated. A visual indication remains set to remind the driver that they have passed a restrictive signal aspect.

===Train Protection &amp; Warning System===
On the UK mainline, TPWS consists of an on-board receiver/timer connected to the emergency braking system of a train, and radio frequency transmitter loops located on the track. The &#x27;Overspeed Sensor System&#x27; pair of loops is located on the approach to the signal, and will activate the train&#x27;s emergency brake if it approaches faster than the &#x27;trigger speed&#x27; when the signal is at &quot;danger&quot;. The &#x27;Train Stop System&#x27; pair of loops is located at the signal, and will activate the emergency brake if the train passes over them at any speed when the signal is at &quot;danger&quot;.

TPWS has proved to be an effective system in the UK, and has prevented several significant collisions. However, its deployment is not universal; only those signals where the risk of collision is considered to be significant are fitted with it.

=== Flank protection ===
At certain junctions, especially where if the signal protecting the junction was passed at &quot;danger&quot; a side collision is likely to result, then flank protection may be used. Derailers and/or facing points beyond the signal protecting the junction will be set in such a position to allow a safe overlap if the signal was passed without authority. This effectively removes the chance of a side-impact collision as the train would be diverted in a parallel path to the approaching train.

=== SPAD indicators ===
Prior to the introduction of TPWS in the UK, &quot;SPAD indicators&quot; were introduced at &#x27;high risk&#x27; locations (for example: the entry to a single track section of line). Consisting of three red lamps, they are placed beyond the protecting stop signal and are normally unlit. If a driver passes the signal at &#x27;danger&#x27;, the top and bottom lamps flash red and the centre lamp, which has the word &quot;STOP&quot; written across the lens in black, is lit continuously. Whenever a SPAD indicator activates, all drivers who observe it are required to stop immediately, even if they can see that the signal pertaining to their own train is showing a &quot;proceed&quot; aspect. Since the introduction of TPWS, provision of new SPAD indicators has become less common.

==UK acronyms: SPAD / SPAR==

In the UK, incidents where a signal is passed at danger without authority are categorised according to principal cause. A SPAD is where the train proceeds beyond its authorised movement to an unauthorised movement. Other types are categorised as SPAR (&quot;signal passed at red&quot;).

Prior to December 2012, the term &quot;SPAD&quot; applied to all such incidents, with a letter specifying cause. 

* A SPAD (formerly &quot;Category A SPAD&quot;) is where the train proceeds beyond its authorised movement to an unauthorised movement.
* A Technical SPAR (formerly &quot;Category B SPAD&quot;) is where the signal reverted to danger in front of the train due to an equipment failure or signaller error and the train was unable to stop before passing the signal.
* A Signaller SPAR (formerly &quot;Category C SPAD&quot;) is where the signal was replaced to danger in front of the train by the signaller in accordance with the rules and regulations and the train was unable to stop before passing the signal.
* A Runaway SPAR (formerly &quot;Category D SPAD&quot;) is where an unattended train or vehicles not attached to a traction unit run away past a signal at danger. Note that where this was the fault of the driver, this will be classed as a SPAD.

Some SPADs are defined as a;
* SAS SPAD – &quot;Starting against signal&quot; SPAD, where the train was standing at a danger signal and the driver moved past it.

* SOY SPAD – &quot;Starting on yellow&quot; SPAD, where the train started on a caution signal and the driver did not appreciate that the next signal would be at danger.

== Passing signals at danger – with authority ==
Signals form part of a complex system, and it is inevitable that faults may occur. They are designed to fail safe, so that when problems occur, the affected signal indicates danger (an example where this did not happen, known as a wrong-side failure, was the Clapham Junction rail crash due primarily to faulty wiring). To keep the network running, safety rules enable trains to pass signals that cannot be cleared to a proceed aspect. Provided that authority for the movement is obtained, a SPAD does not occur. There are two methods of obtaining that authority:

===Driver obtains signaller&#x27;s authority to pass a signal at danger===
Once the train has been brought to a stand at a signal which is at danger, the driver should attempt to contact the signaller. If the signal cannot be cleared then the driver must obtain the signaller&#x27;s authority to pass it at danger. Methods for contacting the signaller may include GSM-R cab radio, signal post telephone or mobile phone.

The signaller can authorise a driver to pass a signal at danger when:

* The signal is defective or disconnected
* The signal cannot be cleared because signalling or level crossing equipment has failed
* The signal is to be passed at danger for shunting purposes
* The signal cannot be cleared because a train or movement which has reversed is then required to start from beyond that signal
* An electric train is to pass the signal protecting an isolated section and proceed towards the limiting point
* A train has been accepted using restricted acceptance because the line is clear only up to the home signal of the next signal box and the section signal cannot be cleared
* In an emergency, and then only when authorised by the signal box supervisor or Operations Control, so that a train carrying passengers can enter an occupied section to use a station platform
* An engineering train is to move towards a possession, or leave a line under possession at an intermediate point
* A train is to pass the signal protecting engineering work to gain access to a station where the train is required to start back, or a line under single line working, or a siding
* The line is to be examined to check that it is clear
* A train is to proceed at caution through an absolute block section from the signal box in rear when a failed train has been removed
* A train is to enter the section after a train or vehicle that has proceeded without authority has been removed, or the front portion of a divided train has passed through the section
* A train is to enter the section to assist a failed train, evacuate passengers from a failed train, remove a portion of a divided train, or remove a train or vehicles that have proceeded without authority
* Single line working applies
* Working by pilotman or modified working applies

The driver and signaller must come to a clear understanding, and ensure they agree about how it is to be done. In the UK the signaller tells the driver of a specific train to pass a specific signal at danger, proceed with caution and travel at a speed that enables him to stop short of any obstruction, and then obey all other signals. If the signal is fitted with TPWS, the driver resets the Driver Reminder Appliance, pushes the TPWS Trainstop Override button in the cab, and proceeds cautiously through the section. If the train reaches the next signal without finding an obstruction, they must obey its aspect, at which point they can revert to normal working.

===Driver passes a signal at danger under their own authority===
If contact with the signaller cannot be made then the driver must not move the train, unless it is standing at one of the following signals:

* A signal controlled from a signal box that is closed on absolute block line only. 
* An automatic signal where local instructions permit it, e.g. signals within tunnels on the Northern City Line.

After passing a signal at danger under their own authority, the driver must stop at the next signal (even if it is showing a proceed aspect) and inform the signaller of what they have done.

==EU statistics of SPADs as precursors of accidents==

== Accidents involving a signal passed at danger without authority ==


== Accidents following a signal passed at danger with authority ==
Whenever a signal is passed at danger the driver is required to &quot;proceed with caution, stop short of any obstructions, and drive at speed that will enable you to stop within the distance which you can see to be clear&quot;. Failure to do this has caused the following collisions:
* – Roseville, 1950
* – Stratford (London Underground), 1953
* – Coppenhall Junction, 1962
* – Wrawby Junction, 1983
* – Glenbrook, 1999
* – Vittorio Emanuele (Rome Metro), 2006

==Accidents where the signaller incorrectly authorised a driver to pass a signal at danger==
Except where permissive working is in use, interlocking usually prevents a train from being signalled into a section that is already occupied. When operational needs require it, this can be overridden, and provided it is carried out in accordance with the rules this is a safe practice. However, failure to follow protocol can result in a collision:
* – Nashville, TN, 1918
* – Bucerdea, 1968 
* – Castlecary rail accidents, 1968
* – Seer Green, 1981
* – Jakarta, 1987
* – Zoufftgen, 2006
* – Szczekociny, 2012
* – Bad Aibling, 2016
* – Thessaly, 2023

<doc id="1119197" wikidata="Q454796" url="?curid=1119197" title="Gertrude of Austria">
<text>Gertrude of Austria (also named &quot;Gertrude of Babenberg&quot;) (c. 1226 – 24 April 1288) was a member of the House of Babenberg, Duchess of Mödling and later titular Duchess of Austria and Styria. She was the niece of Duke Frederick II of Austria, the last male member of the Babenberg dynasty. She was, according to the &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot; decree the first in line to inherit the Duchies of Austria and Styria after the death of childless Frederick, but these claims were disputed by her aunt Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia.

==Early years==
Gertrude was born in 1226 and was the only child of Henry II, Duke of Mödling, by his wife Agnes, daughter of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia. Henry of Mödling was the second son of Leopold VI, Duke of Austria. In 1216, after the death of his older brother Leopold, Henry became his father&#x27;s heir.

Henry died on 26 September 1228, only twenty years old and without male issue. Two years later, on 28 July 1230, Henry&#x27;s father Duke Leopold VI also died and was succeeded by Frederick II, Leopold&#x27;s third son. Because Babenberg Austria was inheritable by females according to the provisions of &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot;, Gertrude disputed Frederick&#x27;s ascension, claiming Austria as her inheritance as the only child of Leopold VI&#x27;s eldest son. Even so, Gertrude&#x27;s claim was eventually bypassed in her uncle&#x27;s favor.

Despite this negative turn of events, Gertrude inherited her father&#x27;s Duchy of Mödling and was placed under the guardianship of her uncle, Frederick II, who, after two unhappy marriages, remained childless. This made Gertrude the primogenitural heiress of the entire Babenberg line of Dukes of Austria and Styria.

== Marriage to Vladislaus III of Moravia ==
Complicating Frederick II&#x27;s hold over Austria was his long-standing quarrel with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, during which he was placed under an imperial ban. In 1245, in a spectacular change of imperial politics, Frederick II of Austria became one of the emperor&#x27;s most important allies when negotiations regarding the elevation of Vienna to a bishopric and of Austria (including Styria) to a Kingdom were initiated. One condition effecting a positive outcome was that the 19-year-old Duke&#x27;s niece, Gertrude, would marry the 51-year-old Emperor who was a widower three times over. Though desirous of the union, Wenceslaus I of Bohemia voiced his concerns given a pre-existing agreement that Gertrude marry his eldest son and heir Vladislaus III of Moravia. Gertrude herself refused the marriage with the aged Emperor, citing his recent excommunication by the Pope. Other sources claim that she was in love with Vladislaus. After sending an army to Austria in order to pressure Duke Frederick II into agreeing to the union of Gertrude and Vladislaus, the two parties came to terms early in June 1245 in Verona. 

On 15 June 1246 Frederick II was killed in battle at Leitha, Hungary. King Wenceslaus quickly arranged the formal marriage ceremony of Gertrude and his heir, Vladislaus. &quot;Per hoc Wladislaus habebat Austriae ducatum&quot; cheered Bohemia and, supported by the rights of his wife and the prospect of inheriting the Bohemian throne, Vladislaus was recognized as Duke by the Austrian aristocracy. Shortly after their marriage, Vladislaus died on 3 January 1247 before he could take possession of the duchy.

== Marriage to Herman VI, Margrave of Baden ==
In 1248, in order to bolster her claims, the 22-year-old Duchess married Herman VI, Margrave of Baden. The following year Gertrude gave birth to a son Frederick I, Margrave of Baden. In celebration of the happy event, Gertrude gave 30 people in Alland, the place of her son&#x27;s birth, extended farm lands which became the foundation of the agrarian community of the &quot;Allander Urhausbesitzer&quot;. In 1250 Gertrude had a second child, a daughter, whom she named Agnes after her maternal grandmother.

Herman was able to maintain only minimal control in the duchies, failing ultimately to defeat the opposition of the Austrian aristocracy. As a result, Gertrude and her children fled to Meissen in Saxony and her relationship with Herman deteriorated significantly. Gertrude was suspected of poisoning Herman when he died on 4 October 1250.

== Marriage to Roman Danylovich ==
Gertrude lost the favour of the curia and with it the chance to recover the Babenberg dominions of Austria and Styria when she refused to marry the brother of Count William II of Holland, Floris, who was also the favoured candidate of Pope Innocent IV. In the meantime, her aunt and competitor for the duchies of Austria and Styria, Margaret, married Ottokar of Bohemia, the second son and next heir of Wenceslaus I. The aristocracy accepted Margaret and Ottokar as the rulers of Austria.

On 12 July 1252, having lost most of her support, Gertrude formed an alliance with Béla IV of Hungary and married his relative, Roman Danylovich, Prince of Halicz, a member of the Rurikid dynasty. In 1253, Gertrude gave birth to her only child from this union, Maria Romanovna. However, after failing to establish himself as Duke of Austria, Roman left Gertrude and their daughter to return to Hungary. Shortly after the marriage was dissolved.

Eventually, in 1254, Gertrude received a portion of Styria, 400 silver marks annually, and the towns of Voitsberg and Judenburg as her residences. In 1267, as neither Gertrude nor her son Frederick forswore their claim to the duchies of Styria and Austria, King Ottokar II dispossessed them of their lands. Ottokar was largely motivated since he sought to remarry into the Hungarian royal house; he could not expect an heir with the significantly older Margaret who was past child bearing age. That same year, the death of Margaret made Gertrude the only legitimate heir to the Babenberg dynasty.

==Later life and death==
On 8 September 1268, Gertrude&#x27;s son Frederick, who had accompanied Conradin on his Italian expedition, was captured in Astura to the south of Anzio. Handed over to Charles of Anjou, he remained in degrading imprisonment in the Castel dell&#x27;Ovo in Naples until his public beheading in the Piazza del Mercato in Naples on 29 October. The following year, Gertrude was exiled and lost her claim to Windisch-Feistritz. Again, she found refuge with her family in Meissen.

Gertrude&#x27;s other claims were ultimately lost when Rudolf I of Germany granted her duchies to his own sons in 1282. Six years later, on 24 April 1288, Gertrude died in the Poor Clare convent of Saint Afra near Seusslitz in Meissen. She was buried in this monastery.

== Legacy ==
Her daughter Agnes of Baden became her mother and brother&#x27;s heir, but in 1279, renounced her rights to Baden and the Duchies of Austria and Styria. From her second marriage with Count Ulrich III of Heunburg, Agnes had five children, two sons (Frederick and Herman) and three daughters (Margaret, Elisabeth and Katharina). The sons died without heirs. The eldest daughter, Katharina, married the Styrian nobleman Ulrich of Sanneck, and their son Frederick I of Cilli eventually inherited his grandfather&#x27;s estates. He founded the House of Cilli, which included Holy Roman Empress Barbara of Cilli whose daughter, Elizabeth of Luxembourg, married into the House of Habsburg.

Gertrude&#x27;s youngest daughter, Maria Romanovna of Halicz, born from her third marriage, married in the second half of the 1260s with Joachim Gutkeled, Ban of Slavonia between 1270 and 1272 (with short interruption) and from 1276 to 1277, and three times Master of the treasury between 1272 and 1275. He was also &quot;ispán&quot;, or head, of many counties, including Baranya and Pozsony. The couple produced only a daughter, Clara, who married Roland Borsa, who served as Voivode of Transylvania in 1282 and from 1284 to 1294; they had no children.

<doc id="1119198" wikidata="Q12188" url="?curid=1119198" title="Flag of Brittany">
<text>The flag of Brittany (; ), a region in the northwest of France, is called the Gwenn-ha-du (), which means &quot;white and black&quot;, in Breton (French: &quot;blanc et noir&quot;). The flag was designed in 1923 by Morvan Marchal. It is also unofficially used in the department of Loire-Atlantique, although this now belongs to the Pays de la Loire and not to the region of Brittany, as the territory of Loire-Atlantique is historically part of the province of Brittany. Nantes (), its prefecture, was once one of the two capital cities of Brittany.

==Overview==
The flag is the official banner of the region of Brittany. It is a symbol of the Breton identity used by Bretons in and outside of Brittany. For years the authorities considered the flag as a separatist symbol, but the attitude has now changed and the flag, no longer having any political connotations, may appear everywhere, even on public buildings, along with the other official flags. It is widely used throughout Brittany and can even be seen on town halls in the region. Because of the absence of legislation concerning regional flags in France the flag is also flown on sailing boats and fishing boats. The design of the ermine spots varies as there is no official description, but although the number is also not specified, in flags produced since the 1970s, the canton virtually always contains exactly 11 spots.

The flag was created in 1923 by Morvan Marchal. He used the flag of the United States as his inspiration, seen as a symbol of freedom.

The nine horizontal stripes represent the traditional dioceses of Brittany into which the duchy was divided historically. The five black stripes represent the French or Gallo speaking dioceses of Dol, Nantes, Rennes, Saint-Malo and Saint-Brieuc; the four white stripes represent the Breton-speaking dioceses of Trégor, Léon, Cornouaille and Vannes. The ermine canton recalls the arms of the Duchy of Brittany.

The flag first came to the notice of a wider public at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris in 1925. It was adopted by various cultural and nationalist groups through the 1920s and 1930s. However its association with nationalist, fascist and separatist groups during the Second World War brought suspicions of collaboration to the flag. A revival of interest in the flag took place in the 1960s. Since then it has mostly lost an association with separatism in the mind of the public and become a widely accepted symbol for all Brittany and Bretons. The older ermine field flag and black cross continue to be used, though rarely, by some individuals and groups.

The blazon of the flag is &quot;Sable four bars argent, a canton ermine&quot;. Traditionally coats of arms could be displayed as a rectangular banner as well as on a shield.

<text>Codrington College is an Anglican theological college in St. John, Barbados now affiliated with the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill. It is one of the oldest Anglican theological colleges in the Americas. It was affiliated to the University of Durham from 1875 to 1965.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early history ===
Codrington College was founded with the profits from the bequest of Christopher Codrington, who after his death in 1710 left portions of his sugar cane estates – the Codrington Plantations as well as land on Barbados and Barbuda to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to establish a religious college in Barbados. As the sugar cane estates were still operating, the society and the college benefited directly from the institution of slavery. In addition to his bequest to the Society, Codrington provided £10,000 (the equivalent of approximately £1.2 million in modern terms) and roughly 12,000 books to his alma mater, All Souls College, Oxford.

In his will, Codrington wrote:

Codrington&#x27;s bequest is unusual for the time in that it was intended to benefit the Afro-Caribbean population of Barbados, rather than colonial colleges which benefited the white planter class. Wilder pointed out that while Codrington directed that a portion of his charitable bequest be used to educate the enslaved population of Barbados immediately or directly, this provision was effectively blocked by the objections of fellow planters. Moreover, the Society, having taken over the Codrington Plantations continued to use slave labour, branding the word &quot;Society&quot; on the chests of slaves owned by them. Slavery in Barbados ended when the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 was enacted. At that time, in accordance with the Slave Compensation Act 1837, the Society received £8,823 for 411 slaves as compensation for the loss of their labour.

Construction of the college was started in 1714, and it was eventually opened on 9 September 1745 with twelve or 16 male students. Some of the delay in completing the structure is attributed to disputes regarding the properties and related debts (and perhaps political opposition as noted by Wilder above). Later, on 10 October 1780, a hurricane severely damaged the building. That, plus a downturn in the economic climate led to the school being closed between 1780 and 1797. The Reverend Mark Nicholson was appointed the head of Codrington in 1797 and stayed on until 1821, providing stability for the college and preparing it for the next stage of its development. History would repeat itself in 1831 when the site was almost completely destroyed by a hurricane but was rebuilt. In 1926 fire gutted the college.

The college initially provided a general education at secondary level. Its curriculum was similar to that found in English grammar schools of that time. There were no other schools in Barbados at the time, so there was a need to prepare students for a college level education. Thomas Moody, an advisor of the Colonial Office, served as mathematics master, writing master, and Assistant Headmaster of Codrington College 
from 1797 to 1805.

=== 1800s ===
Beginning around 1824 and influenced by the first Bishop of the new See of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, Bishop William Hart Coleridge, Codrington made substantial steps towards teaching at the college level. While some advanced studies had been offered as early as 1748, these were usually taken up by sons of the local gentry (who had tutors at home) before they went to an English university. The first graduate had been ordained in 1759. The grammar school was moved to the Chaplain&#x27;s lodge so that the college could focus on higher studies and became known as The Lodge School.

On 9 September 1830, Codrington College opened formally focussing exclusively on training students for ordination. This marked it as one of the first theological colleges of the Anglican Church; only St. David&#x27;s College Lampeter, St Bees Theological College, the General Theological Seminary and Virginia Theological Seminary pre-date it.

In 1875, Codrington entered a new stage by entering into an affiliation with Durham University in England. Thus, graduates of Codrington received a Durham degree in classics or theology. Codrington was the first overseas institution to have the right to grant a degree from a British university. This affiliation in the classics lasted until 1958 by which 283 Codrington graduates had obtained Durham degrees. The terms of the affiliation read (in part):

=== 1900s ===
Around 1912, Codrington, under the direction of Principal Anstey, commenced delivering teacher training. The teacher training institution was called the Rawle Training Institute, 
named after a previous college principal. It initially enrolled men only, accepting women a year or two later. The Rawle provided teacher training not just to Barbadians but to individuals from other parts of the West Indies. Rawle was the forerunner of the Erdiston Teachers&#x27; Training College, established in 1948, signalling the end of Codrington&#x27;s involvement in teacher training and the closure of the Rawle Institute.

The late 1940s and early 1950s saw several factors lead to a discussion of the affiliation between Codrington College and Durham University. One was the establishment of the University College of the West Indies, the predecessor to the University of the West Indies. The university was founded in 1948, on the recommendation of the Asquith Commission through its sub-committee on the West Indies chaired by Sir James Irvine. The Asquith Commission had been established in 1943 to review the provision of higher education in the British colonies. Initially in a special relationship with the University of London, the then University College of the West Indies (UCWI) was seated at Mona, about five miles from Kingston, Jamaica. The university was based at the Gibraltar Camp used by evacuated Gibraltarians during the war.

The fact that the new institution was established in Jamaica and the final report of the commission made no mention of Codrington raised questions of its relevance. Moreover, Durham was concerned about the quality of the education offered at Codrington. One of the reasons for this was the minimal communication between the two institutions. Letters to Codrington were routinely left unanswered. In fact, the Society was still involved in managing and funding Codrington College. When the Society announced, in the press, that the college would be run by the brothers of the Community of the Resurrection, officials at Durham had not been informed and took finding out about the arrangement in the press disconcerting. Eventually, it was decided to alter the affiliation agreement so that only degrees in theology would be granted by Durham, which then mirrored the focus of studies at Codrington. The establishment of the University College of the West Indies meant that non-religious studies in the Caribbean would be focused on the new institution. Codrington, therefore, focussed its studies on theology. It was assumed that Codrington would seek affiliation with the new University College.

Since 1965, Codrington has been affiliated to the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill. The Licentiate in Theology was first introduced that year, followed by the BA in Theology in 1971, in affiliation with Cave Hill. Codrington began to offer a Diploma in Theology on a part-time basis in 1978. This course was designed for lay people who taught religion in day schools and who played important roles in churches. It began to offer post-graduate courses in 1989.

The college currently maintains several archives relating to the churches of the West Indies. The microfilm collection includes records of the Society, The Church Missionary Society, the Baptist Missionary Society, and the Presbyterian Church of Trinidad and Grenada.

In 1976, changes were made to the governance of both Codrington College and the Codrington Estates. Two boards were established, one for the estates and another for the college. In this way, day-to-day running of both came under the Anglican Church of the West Indies. Later, the Codrington Trust Act moved legal control from the Society (now called the United Society Partners in the Gospel) to a completely West Indian group. This was the outcome of the government having taken over the funding of the grammar school, referred to as the Lodge School, in 1879 and leasing the premises for 100 years. On its expiry, the government decided, with the support of the USPG, that it was time for the Codrington Trust to be fully in the control of local people.

== Campus ==

In 1713, Colonel Christian Lilly designed the original Codrington College building, on the model University of Oxford college, with four long sides of a building enclosing a quadrangle. However, due to financial constraints, only the southern portion of the plan was built, with the construction period lasting from 1714 to 1743. The main building is constructed of coral stone. The design includes a central portico with a pediment and three high arches sitting between a chapel and dining hall with a bust of Christopher Codrington. The chapel has an altar configured with a vaulted ceiling and panelled with ebony, lignum vitae, and cordia wood.

The campus also includes the Principal&#x27;s Lodge. Originally, the Consett plantation great house, it was a large building but simply designed in three chambers. The impressive porch is carved coral stone and original, carved Jacobean balustrades have survived through a building fire. The building is now used as a library and for study space.

The campus is entered via road lined with specimen trees of varyious species, including giant silk cotton, whitewood or white cedars, mahogany and others. An ornamental lake is fed by a natural spring.

== Academics ==
The college now offers a small number of undergraduate and graduate diplomas and degrees, both for those planning to join the Anglican Church as priests and for lay members.

=== Undergraduate studies ===
Diploma in Theological Studies. This two-year program is designed for lay people who are leaders in their church. The part-time programme includes six modules taken over two years. The courses are available in either a traditional face-to-face format or in an online format with asynchronous content and synchronous online sessions with the facilitator. Courses include systematic theology, the Old Testament, the New Testament, history of Christianity, Christian ethics and comparative religion. The subsequent certificate is awarded by Codrington.

Licentiate in Theology. The licentiate degree (L.Th) is designed to prepare individuals to become Anglican priests. Entrance requirements range from a high school diploma through to a previous university degree. A wide range of courses is offered in this programme. The degree is awarded by the University of the West Indies.

Bachelor of Arts in Theology. The BA (Theology) degree is also designed to prepare individuals to become Anglican ministers. Students may opt for a three-year program or a four-year programme and the entry requirements are the same as entry to the Faculty of Humanities and Education of the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, being basically high school graduation or community college/associate degree credentials. A wide range of courses is offered in this programme. The degree is awarded by the University of the West Indies.

Minors in Theology. It is also possible to take a minor in theology in one of three foci: Biblical Studies, Historical &amp; Pastoral Studies, or Systematic &amp; Religious. The degree is awarded by the University of the West Indies.

Diploma in Pastoral Studies. The Student Handbook mentions a Diploma in Pastoral Studies. It appears that the diploma provides the professional training not included in the BA Theology or Licentiate in Theology, though the handbook states that &quot;candidates may offer some of the above [diploma] courses for the L.Th. or B.A. Theology&quot;. Courses in this diploma include homiletics, pastoral studies, spirituality, and stewardship.

=== Graduate studies ===
Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in theology are also available. The main areas of study at this level are biblical studies, church history and theology, pastoral and liturgical studies, and systematic theology and philosophy. Entry into these programmes would require, &quot;inter alia&quot;, a bachelor&#x27;s degree for the Master&#x27;s programmes, and a master&#x27;s degree for the doctoral programme, or equivalent preparation, usually in theology. These degrees are awarded by the UWI.

== Administration ==
As noted in the history section above, responsibility for the Codrington Estate passed from the Society to local hands. This is in the form of the Codrington Trust. The Trust, therefore, is responsible for the continued development of the bequest. There are seven members of the Trust governing body, five appointed by the Church and two appointed by the Minister (the Codrington Trust Act does not specify which Minister but a current trustee is from the Ministry of Social Care, Constituency Empowerment &amp; Community Development).

The College Board is responsible for the leadership of the college. The board consists of 11 members, including the principal, a staff representative, a student representative, a UWI representative and a person nominated by the Minister. Most of the others are members of the clergy.

Codrington College is led by the Principal, currently the Rev. Dr. Michael Clarke. He is assisted by a Dean, the Warden/Chaplaincy and the Registrar.

<text>Pozuelo de Alarcón () is a municipality in the Community of Madrid, Spain. Bordering the Moncloa-Aravaca district of Madrid proper to its west, Pozuelo de Alarcón is surrounded by large Mediterranean pine-tree forests: the Casa de Campo, the Monte del Pardo, and the Monte del Pilar. , it ranks as the wealthiest municipality in Spain. La Finca, an isolated luxury residential area known by its affluent residents, most notably football players, lies within the municipality bounds.

==History==

Pozuelo has become a low-density residential area during recent decades, as new residential developments have spread over formerly agricultural lands. New transportation infrastructure is approved by the local government. Notable infrastructure developments include the M-40 (the second, counting outwards, of Madrid&#x27;s ring motorways) and the new &#x27;Metro Ligero&#x27; (light rail) line ML2 of the Madrid metro system, which was built in summer 2007 to connect Pozuelo with the Aluche district in the city of Madrid. Two stations also serve Pozuelo: &quot;Pozuelo&quot; and &quot;El Barrial-Centro Commercial Pozuelo&quot; of the Madrid area local train system, the &quot;Cercanias&quot;. Road access is provided by the A6 and the M503, with the Madrid orbital M40 running to the west.

<text>Han Shaogong (; born January 1, 1953) is a Chinese novelist and fiction writer.

==Biography==
Han was born in Hunan, China. While relying on traditional Chinese culture, in particular Chinese mythology, folklore, Taoism and Buddhism as source of inspiration, he also borrows freely from Western literary techniques. As a teenager during the Cultural revolution he was labeled an ‘educated youth’ and sent to the countryside for re-education through labour. Employed at a local cultural center after 1977, he soon won recognition as an outspoken new literary talent. His early stories attacked the ultra-leftist degradation of China during the Mao era; they tended toward a slightly modernist style. However, he reemerged in the mid-1980s as the leader of an avant-garde school, the &quot;Search for Roots&quot; or the &quot;Xungen Movement&quot;.

==Work==
Han&#x27;s major work to date is &quot;A Dictionary of Maqiao&quot;, a novel published in 1996 and translated into English in 2003. His writing is influenced by Kafka and by the magic realism of Gabriel García Márquez. In 1987, he published a Chinese translation of Milan Kundera&#x27;s &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; and edited &quot;Hainan Jishi Wenxue&quot; (&quot;Hainan Documentary Literature&quot;), a successful literary magazine. He has been given the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and with other Chinese writers visited France in 1988 at the invitation of the French Ministry of Culture. Han was invited back in 1989 but was denied permission to leave China until 1991.

Han&#x27;s other works include &quot;Moon Orchid&quot; (1985), &quot;Bababa&quot; (1985), &quot;Womanwomanwoman&quot; (1985), &quot;Deserted City&quot; (1989), and &quot;Intimations&quot; (2002).

==Awards==
* In 2011 Han was awarded the Newman Prize for Chinese Literature.

<doc id="1119225" wikidata="Q2992519" url="?curid=1119225" title="History of LSD">
<text>The psychedelic drug (or entheogen) lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was first synthesized on November 16, 1938, by the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. It was not until five years later on April 19, 1943, that the psychedelic properties were found. Today, the discovery of LSD is celebrated worldwide during the annual Bicycle Day holiday, serving also as the day celebrating the psychedelic revolution in general.

== Discovery ==

Albert Hofmann, born in Switzerland, joined the pharmaceutical-chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories, located in Basel, as a co-worker with professor Arthur Stoll, founder and director of the pharmaceutical department. He began studying the medicinal plant squill and the fungus ergot as part of a program to purify and synthesize active constituents for use as pharmaceuticals. His main contribution was to elucidate the chemical structure of the common nucleus of &quot;Scilla&quot; glycosides (an active principle of Mediterranean squill). While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on November 16, 1938. The main intention of the synthesis was to obtain a respiratory and circulatory stimulant (an analeptic). It was set aside for five years, until April 16, 1943, when Hofmann decided to take a second look at it. While re-synthesizing LSD, he accidentally absorbed a small amount of the drug and discovered its powerful effects. He described what he felt as being:
=== Bicycle Day ===

On April 19, 1943, Hofmann ingested 0.25 milligrams (250 micrograms) of the substance, which he estimated to be a small dose, but is actually about 10 times the minimum amount that produces a psychedelic effect. Between one and two hours later, Hofmann experienced slow and gradual changes in his perception. He asked his laboratory assistant to escort him home. As was customary in Basel, they made the journey by bicycle. On the way, Hofmann&#x27;s condition rapidly deteriorated as he struggled with feelings of anxiety, alternating in his beliefs that the next-door neighbor was a malevolent witch, that he was going insane, and that the LSD had poisoned him. When the house doctor arrived, however, he could detect no physical abnormalities, save for a pair of widely dilated pupils. Hofmann was reassured, and soon his terror began to give way to a sense of good fortune and enjoyment, as he later wrote:

The events of this first LSD trip, now known as &quot;Bicycle Day&quot;, after the bicycle ride home, proved to Hofmann that he had indeed made a significant discovery: a psychoactive substance with extraordinary potency, capable of causing significant shifts of consciousness in incredibly low doses. (The term &quot;trip&quot; was first coined by US Army scientists during the 1950s when they were experimenting with LSD.) Hofmann foresaw the drug as a powerful psychiatric tool; because of its intense and introspective nature, he could not imagine anyone using it recreationally. 

Bicycle Day is an informal celebration on April 19th of the anniversary of this first LSD trip, and the psychedelic revolution in general. It is sometimes celebrated by riding a bike on psychedelics and/or in a parade, and often with psychedelic-themed festivities. The celebration of Bicycle Day originated in DeKalb, Illinois, in 1985, when Thomas B. Roberts, then a professor at Northern Illinois University, invented the name &quot;Bicycle Day&quot; when he founded the first celebration at his home. Several years later, he sent an announcement made by one of his students to friends and Internet lists, thus propagating the idea and the celebration. His original intent was to commemorate Hofmann&#x27;s original, accidental exposure on April 16, but that date fell midweek and was not a good time for the party, so he chose the 19th to honor Hofmann&#x27;s first intentional exposure.

== Psychiatric use ==
Sandoz manufactured LSD for research use, and provided ampules to qualified researchers under the trade-name Delysid in 1947.

LSD was brought to the attention of the United States in 1949 by Sandoz Laboratories because they believed LSD might have clinical applications.

Throughout the 1950s, mainstream media reported on research into LSD and its growing use in psychiatry, and undergraduate psychology students taking LSD as part of their education described the effects of the drug. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published six positive reports on LSD between 1954 and 1959.

LSD was originally perceived as a psychotomimetic capable of producing model psychosis. By the mid-1950s, LSD research was being conducted in major American medical centers, where researchers used LSD as a means of temporarily replicating the effects of mental illness. One of the leading authorities on LSD during the 1950s in the United States was the psychoanalyst Sidney Cohen. Cohen first took the drug on October 12, 1955, and expected to have an unpleasant trip, but was surprised when he experienced &quot;no confused, disoriented delirium.&quot; He reported that the &quot;problems and strivings, the worries and frustrations of everyday life vanished; in their place was a majestic, sunlit, heavenly inner quietude.&quot; Cohen immediately began his own experiments with LSD with the help of Aldous Huxley whom he had met in 1955. In 1957, with the help of psychologist Betty Eisner, Cohen began experimenting on whether or not LSD might have a helpful effect in facilitating psychotherapy, curing alcoholism, and enhancing creativity. Between 1957 and 1958, they treated 22 patients who had minor personality disorders. LSD was also given to artists in order to track their mental deterioration, but Huxley believed LSD might enhance their creativity. Between 1958 and 1962, psychiatrist Oscar Janiger tested LSD on more than 100 painters, writers, and composers.

In one study in the late 1950s, Humphry Osmond gave LSD to alcoholics in Alcoholics Anonymous who had failed to quit drinking. After one year, around 50% of the study group had not had a drink—a success rate that has never been duplicated by any other means. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, participated in medically supervised experiments on the effects of LSD on alcoholism and believed LSD could be used to cure alcoholics.

In the United Kingdom the use of LSD was pioneered by Ronald A. Sandison in 1952, at Powick Hospital, Worcestershire. A special LSD unit was set up in 1958. After Sandison left the hospital in 1964, medical superintendent Arthur Spencer took over and continued the clinical use of the drug until it was withdrawn in 1965. In all, 683 patients were treated with LSD in 13,785 separate sessions at Powick, but Spencer was the last member of the medical staff to use it.

From the late 1940s through the mid-1970s, extensive research and testing was conducted on LSD. During a 15-year period beginning in 1950, research on LSD and other hallucinogens generated over 1,000 scientific papers, several dozen books, and six international conferences. Overall, LSD was prescribed as treatment to over 40,000 patients. Film star Cary Grant was one of many men during the 1950s and 1960s who were given LSD in concert with psychotherapy. Many psychiatrists began taking the drug recreationally and sharing it with friends. Leary&#x27;s experiments &quot;(see Timothy Leary below)&quot; spread LSD usage to a much wider segment of the general populace.

Sandoz halted LSD production in August 1965 after growing governmental protests at its proliferation among the general populace. The National Institute of Mental Health in the United States distributed LSD on a limited basis for scientific research. Scientific study of LSD largely ceased by about 1980 as research funding declined, and governments became wary of permitting such research, fearing that the results of the research might encourage illicit LSD use. By the end of the 20th century, there were few authorized researchers left, and their efforts were mostly directed towards establishing approved protocols for further work with LSD in easing the suffering of the dying and with drug addicts and alcoholics.

A 2014 study showed evidence that LSD can have therapeutic benefits in treating anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases. Rick Doblin, an American drug researcher, described the work as &quot;a proof of concept&quot; that he hoped would &quot;break these substances out of the mold of the counterculture and bring them back to the lab as part of a psychedelic renaissance.&quot;
== Resistance and prohibition ==

By the mid-1960s the backlash against the use of LSD and its perceived corrosive effects on cultural values resulted in governmental action to restrict the availability of the drug by making use of it illegal. LSD was declared a &quot;Schedule I&quot; substance, legally designating that the drug has a &quot;high potential for abuse&quot; and is without any &quot;currently accepted medical use in treatment.&quot; LSD was removed from legal circulation. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration claimed:
The governors of Nevada and California each signed bills into law on May 30, 1966, that make them the first two American states to outlaw the manufacture, sale, and possession of the drug. The law went into effect immediately in Nevada, and on October 6, 1966, in California. Other U.S. states and many other countries soon followed with similar bans.

== Influential individuals ==

=== Aldous Huxley ===

Renowned British intellectual Aldous Huxley was one of the most important figures in the early history of LSD. He was a figure of high repute in the world of letters and had become internationally famous through his novels &quot;Crome Yellow&quot;, &quot;Antic Hay&quot; and his dystopian novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;. His experiments with psychedelic drugs (initially mescaline) and his descriptions of them in his writings did much to spread awareness of psychedelic drugs to the general public and arguably helped to glamorize their recreational use, although Huxley himself treated them very seriously.

Huxley was introduced to psychedelic drugs in 1953 by a friend, psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. Osmond had become interested in hallucinogens and their relationship to mental illness in the 1940s. During the 1950s, he completed extensive studies of a number of drugs, including mescaline and LSD. As noted above, Osmond had some remarkable success in treating alcoholics with LSD.

In May 1953 Osmond gave Huxley his first dose of mescaline at the Huxley home. In 1954 Huxley recorded his experiences in the landmark book &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;; the title was drawn from a quotation by British artist and poet William Blake. Huxley tried LSD for the first time in 1955, obtained from &quot;Captain&quot; Al Hubbard.

=== Alfred Hubbard ===

Alfred Matthew Hubbard is reputed to have introduced more than 6,000 people to LSD, including scientists, politicians, intelligence officials, diplomats, and church figures. He became known as the original &quot;Captain Trips&quot;, travelling about with a leather case containing pharmaceutically pure LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin. He became a &quot;freelance&quot; apostle for LSD in the early 1950s after supposedly receiving an angelic vision telling him that something important to the future of mankind would soon be coming. When he read about LSD the next year, he immediately sought and acquired LSD, which he tried for himself in 1951.

Although he had no medical training, Hubbard collaborated on running psychedelic sessions with LSD with Ross McLean at Vancouver&#x27;s Hollywood Hospital, with psychiatrists Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond; with Myron Stolaroff at the International Federation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park, California; and with Willis Harman at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). At various times over the next 20 years, Hubbard also reportedly worked for the Canadian Special Services, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms. It is also rumored that he was involved with the CIA&#x27;s MK-ULTRA project. How his government positions actually interacted with his work with LSD is unknown.

=== Harold A. Abramson ===

In 1955, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported:

&quot;In Manhattan, Psychiatrist Harold A. Abramson of the Cold Spring Harbor Biological Laboratory has developed a technique of serving dinner to a group of subjects, topping off the meal with a liqueur glass containing 40 micrograms of LSD.&quot;

This mention in America&#x27;s most popular newsweekly is noteworthy because Abramson was not a psychiatrist or even a psychologist, but was an allergist who was a key participant in the CIA MK-ULTRA mind-control program.

=== R. Gordon Wasson ===

In 1957, R. Gordon Wasson, the vice president of J.P. Morgan, published an article in &quot;Life&quot; magazine extolling the virtues of magic mushrooms. This prompted Albert Hofmann to isolate psilocybin in 1958 for distribution by Sandoz with its product LSD in the U.S., further raising interest in LSD in the mass media. Following Wasson&#x27;s report, Timothy Leary visited Mexico to experience the mushrooms.

=== Timothy Leary ===
Timothy Leary, a lecturer in psychology at Harvard University, was the most prominent pro-LSD researcher. Leary claimed that using LSD with the right dosage, set (one&#x27;s emotional mindset at time of ingestion), and setting, preferably with the guidance of professionals, could alter behavior in dramatic and beneficial ways. Leary began conducting experiments with psilocybin in 1960 on himself and a number of Harvard graduate students after trying hallucinogenic mushrooms used in Native American religious rituals while visiting Mexico. His group began conducting experiments on state prisoners, where they claimed a 90% success rate preventing repeat offenses.

Later reexamination of Leary&#x27;s data reveals his results to be skewed, whether intentionally or not; the percent of men in the study who ended up back in prison later in life was approximately 2% lower than the usual rate. Leary was later introduced to LSD, and he then incorporated that drug into his research as his mental catalyst of choice. Leary claimed that his experiments produced no murders, suicides, psychotic breaks, or bad trips. Almost all of Leary&#x27;s participants reported profound mystical experiences which they felt had a tremendously positive effect on their lives. While it is true that Leary&#x27;s experiments did not lead to any murders, he willfully chose to ignore the bad trips which occurred, as well as the attempted suicide of a woman the day after she was given mescaline by Leary.

By 1962, the Harvard faculty&#x27;s disapproval with Leary&#x27;s experiments reached critical mass. Leary was informed that the CIA was monitoring his research (&quot;see Government experiments below&quot;). Many of the other faculty members had harbored reservations about Leary&#x27;s research, and parents began complaining to the university about Leary&#x27;s distribution of hallucinogenic drugs to their children. Further, many undergraduate students who were not part of Leary&#x27;s research program heard of the profound experiences other students had undergone and began taking LSD for recreational purposes, which was not illegal at the time . Leary described LSD as a potent aphrodisiac in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Leary left the university for an extended amount of time during the spring semester, thus failing to fulfill his duties as professor. Leary and another Harvard psychologist, Richard Alpert, were dismissed from the university in 1963.

In 1964, they published &quot;The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, which argued that the psychedelic experience paralleled the death/rebirth experience described in the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; (Tibetan Book of the Dead). Leary and Alpert, unfazed by their dismissals, relocated first to Mexico, but were expelled from the country by the Mexican government. They then set up at a large private mansion owned by William Hitchcock, named after the small town in New York State where it is located, Millbrook, where they continued their experiments. Their research lost its controlled scientific character as the experiments transformed into LSD parties. Leary later wrote, &quot;We saw ourselves as anthropologists from the twenty-first century inhabiting a time module set somewhere in the Dark Ages of the 1960s. On this space colony, we were attempting to create a new paganism and a new dedication to life as art.&quot;

A judge who expressed dislike for Leary&#x27;s books sentenced him to 30 years in prison for possession of half a marijuana cigarette in violation of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. However, this decision was reversed in the 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Timothy Leary v. United States (&quot;395 U.S. 6) on the grounds that the Act required self-incrimination, thus violating the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Publicity surrounding the case further cemented Leary&#x27;s growing reputation as a counter cultural guru. Around this time, President Richard Nixon described Leary as &quot;the most dangerous man in America.&quot; Repeated FBI raids instigated the end of the Millbrook experiment. Leary refocused his efforts towards countering the tremendous amount of anti-LSD propaganda then being issued by the United States government, popularizing the slogan &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out.&quot; Many experts blame Leary and his activism for the near-total suppression of psychedelic research over the next 35 years.

=== Owsley Stanley ===

Historically, LSD was distributed not for profit, but because those who made and distributed it truly believed that the psychedelic experience could be beneficial for humanity. A limited number of chemists, probably fewer than a dozen, are believed to have manufactured nearly all of the illicit LSD available in the United States. The best known of these is undoubtedly Augustus Owsley Stanley III, usually known simply as Owsley or Bear.
The former chemistry student set up a private LSD lab in the mid-60s in San Francisco and supplied the LSD consumed at the famous Acid Test parties held by Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, as well as the Human Be-In in San Francisco in January 1967 and the Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967. He also had close social connections with the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Big Brother and The Holding Company, regularly supplying them with LSD and working as their live sound engineer, creating many tapes of these groups in concert. Owsley&#x27;s LSD activities—immortalized by Steely Dan in their song &quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot;—ended with his arrest at the end of 1967, but some other manufacturers most likely operated continuously for 30 years or more. Announcing Owsley&#x27;s first bust in 1966, The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; headline &quot;LSD Millionaire Arrested&quot; inspired the rare Grateful Dead song &quot;Alice D. Millionaire&quot;.

Owsley associated with other early LSD producers, Tim Scully and Nicholas Sand.

=== Ken Kesey ===

Ken Kesey was born in 1935 in La Junta, Colorado to dairy farmers Frederick A. Kesey and Ginevra Smith. In 1946, the family moved to Springfield, Oregon. A champion wrestler in both high school and college, he graduated from Springfield High School in 1953.

Kesey attended the University of Oregon&#x27;s School of Journalism, where he received a degree in speech and communication in 1957, where he was also a brother of Beta Theta Pi. He was awarded a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship in 1958 to enroll in the creative writing program at Stanford University, which he did the following year. While at Stanford, he studied under Wallace Stegner and began the manuscript that would become &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

At Stanford in 1959, Kesey volunteered to take part in a CIA-financed study named Project MKULTRA at the Menlo Park Veterans Hospital. The project studied the effects on the patients of psychoactive drugs, particularly LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, AMT, and DMT. Kesey wrote many detailed accounts of his experiences with these drugs, both during the Project MKULTRA study and in the years of private experimentation that followed. Kesey&#x27;s role as a medical guinea pig inspired him to write the book &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; in 1962. The success of the book, as well as the sale of his residence at Stanford, allowed him to move to La Honda, California in the mountains west of Stanford University. He frequently entertained friends and many others with parties he called &quot;Acid Tests&quot; involving music (such as Kesey&#x27;s favorite band, The Warlocks, later known as the Grateful Dead), black lights, fluorescent paint, strobes and other &quot;psychedelic&quot; effects, and, of course, LSD. These parties were noted in some of Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poems and are also described in the books &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; by Tom Wolfe, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot; by Hunter S. Thompson, and &quot;Freewheelin Frank, Secretary of the Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; by Frank Reynolds. Ken Kesey was also said to have experimented with LSD with Ringo Starr in 1965 and that he influenced the setup for future performances with The Beatles in the UK.

In the summer of 1964, Kesey&#x27;s Merry Pranksters customized a bus named &quot;Furthur&quot; and set out on a tour to propagate LSD use.

=== Sidney Cohen ===

Sidney Cohen was a Los Angeles-based psychiatrist. His work focused on the effects of psychedelics, primarily LSD. Cohen published 13 books in his life, all of them based on drugs and substance abuse. He began working with LSD in the 1950s. One of his earlier works is a video of an experiment that shows Cohen interviewing a woman before and after administering her LSD.
In the later part of the 1960s he worked as a director for the National Institute of Mental Health in their Division of Narcotic Addiction and Drug Abuse. He has been open about having taken LSD many times himself, but was always opposed to the growing use of LSD amongst members of the counterculture movement. Cohen thought LSD was safe only if used under medical supervision and that the average person was not equipped with the ability to handle the drug safely. Through his work he had become known as one of the leading experts in LSD research.

=== William Leonard Pickard ===

William Leonard Pickard earned a scholarship to Princeton University but dropped out after one term, instead preferring to hang out at Greenwich Village jazz clubs in New York City. In 1971, he got a job as a research manager at the University of California, Berkeley in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, a job he held until 1974.

In December 1988, a neighbor reported a strange chemical odor coming from an architectural shop at a Mountain View, California industrial park. Federal agents arrived to find 200,000 doses of LSD and William Pickard inside. Pickard was charged with manufacturing LSD and served five years in prison.

By 1994, Pickard had enrolled at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. His studies focused on drug abuse in the former Soviet Union, where he theorized that the booming black market and many unemployed chemists could lead to a flood of the drug market.

In 2000, Pickard was arrested for manufacturing LSD in Kansas and was serving two life sentences at United States Penitentiary, Tucson. On July 27, 2020, Pickard was granted Compassionate Release from federal prison after serving 17 years of his sentence.

== Secret government research ==
The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) became interested in LSD when they read reports alleging that American prisoners during the Korean War were being brainwashed with the use of some sort of drug or &quot;lie serum&quot;. LSD was the original centerpiece of the top secret MKULTRA project, an ambitious undertaking conducted from the 1950s through the 70s designed to explore the possibilities of pharmaceutical mind control. Hundreds of participants, including CIA agents, government employees, military personnel, prostitutes, members of the general public, and mental patients were given LSD, many without their knowledge or consent. The experiments often involved severe psychological torture. To guard against outward reactions, doctors conducted experiments in clinics and laboratories where subjects were monitored by EEG machines and had their words recorded. Some studies investigated whether drugs, stress or specific environmental conditions could be used to break prisoners or to induce confessions.

The CIA also created The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, which was a CIA funding front which provided grants to social scientists and medical researchers investigating questions of interest related to the MKULTRA program. Between 1960 and 1963, the CIA gave $856,782 worth of grants to different organizations. The researchers eventually concluded that LSD&#x27;s effects were too varied and uncontrollable to make it of any practical use as a truth drug, and the project moved on to other substances. It would be decades before the U.S. government admitted the existence of the project and offered apologies to the families of those who were forced to participate in the experiments. During this time period, the use of LSD for psychochemical warfare was under consideration and testing, among other substances. Looking to replicate the effects of nerve gas created by the Germans during World War II without the toxicity, LSD was sought for use under the pretense that it could induce hysteria and psychoses, or at least an inability to fight without wholesale destruction of the enemy and their properties. Thousands of tests on willing research subjects took place at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, with the ultimate conclusion being that LSD was too unpredictable and uncontrollable for any tactical use.

== Recreational use ==
=== From 1960 to 1980 ===
LSD began to be used recreationally in certain (primarily medical) circles. Mainly academics and medical professionals, who became acquainted with LSD in their work, began using it themselves and sharing it with friends and associates. Among the first to do so was British psychiatrist Humphry Osmond.

====Psychedelic subculture goes mainstream====

LSD historian Jay Stevens, author of the 1987 book &quot;Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream&quot;, has said that in the early days of its recreational use, LSD users (who were at that time mostly academics and medical professionals) fell into two broadly delineated groups. The first group, which was essentially conservative and exemplified by Aldous Huxley, felt that LSD was too powerful and too dangerous to allow its immediate and widespread introduction, and that its use ought to be restricted to the &#x27;elite&#x27; members of society—artists, writers, scientists—who could mediate its gradual distribution throughout society. The second and more radical group, typified by Richard Alpert and Timothy Leary, felt that LSD had the power to revolutionize society and that it should be spread as widely as possible and be available to all.

During the 1960s, this second &#x27;group&#x27; of casual LSD users evolved and expanded into a subculture that extolled the mystical and religious symbolism often engendered by the drug&#x27;s powerful effects, and advocated its use as a method of raising consciousness. The personalities associated with the subculture included spiritual gurus such as Leary and psychedelic rock musicians such as the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane and the Beatles, and soon attracted a great deal of publicity, generating further interest in LSD.

The popularization of LSD outside of the medical world was hastened when individuals such as author Ken Kesey participated in drug trials and liked what they saw. Tom Wolfe wrote a widely read account of the early days of LSD&#x27;s entrance into the non-academic world in his book &quot;The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test&quot;, which documented the cross-country, acid-fueled voyage of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters on the psychedelic bus &quot;Furthur&quot; and the Pranksters&#x27; later &#x27;Acid Test&#x27; LSD parties.

In 1965, Sandoz laboratories stopped its still legal shipments of LSD to the United States for research and psychiatric use, after a request from the U.S. government concerned about its use. By April 1966, LSD use had become so widespread that &quot;Time&quot; magazine warned about its dangers.

In December 1966, the exploitation film &quot;Hallucination Generation&quot; was released. This was followed by the films &quot;The Trip&quot; in 1967 and &quot;Psych-Out&quot; in 1968.

==== Musicians and LSD ====
On March 27, 1965, Beatles members John Lennon and George Harrison (and their wives) were dosed with LSD without their permission by their dentist, John Riley. Lennon mentioned the incident in his famous 1970 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, but the name of the dentist was revealed only in 2006. On August 24, 1965, Lennon, Harrison and Ringo Starr took their second trip on LSD. Actor Peter Fonda repeatedly said &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to be dead&quot; to John Lennon during an LSD trip. John Lennon wrote &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, a fanciful song which many assumed referred to LSD, although he always denied the connection as coincidence. The songs &quot;She Said She Said&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; album explicitly reference LSD trips, and many lines of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; were borrowed from Timothy Leary&#x27;s book &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;. Around the same time, bands such as Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, and The Grateful Dead helped give birth to a genre known as &quot;psychedelic rock&quot; or acid rock. In 1965, The Pretty Things released an album called &quot;Get the Picture?&quot; which included a track titled &quot;L.S.D.&quot;

LSD became a headline item in early 1967, and the Beatles admitted to having been under the influence of LSD. Earlier in the year, British tabloid &quot;News of the World&quot; ran a sensational three-week series on &quot;drug parties&quot; hosted by rock group the Moody Blues and attended by leading stars including Donovan, the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend and Cream drummer Ginger Baker. Largely as a result of collusion between &quot;News of the World&quot; journalists and the London Drug Squad, many pop stars including Donovan and Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were arrested for drug possession, although none of the arrests involved LSD.

The FBI suggested in now declassified documents that the Grateful Dead were responsible for introducing LSD to the U.S. The Grateful Dead were the &quot;house band&quot; at Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters&#x27; Acid Tests. These free-form parties introduced many people on the West Coast to LSD for the first time, as documented in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; and Phil Lesh&#x27;s &quot;Searching for the Sound&quot;. Acid historian Jesse Jarnow describes how Grateful Dead concerts served as the United States&#x27; primary distribution network for LSD in the second half of the twentieth century.

In 1992, Mike Dirnt of Green Day wrote the famous &quot;Longview&quot; bass line while under the influence of LSD. In an interview, Green Day lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong recalled that he arrived at their house and saw Mike sitting on the floor with highly dilated pupils, holding his bass guitar. Mike looked up at Billie and exclaimed, &quot;Listen to this!&quot;

==== Production of LSD ====

During the 1960s and early 1970s, the drug culture adopted LSD as the psychedelic drug of choice, particularly amongst the hippie community. However, LSD dramatically decreased in popularity in the mid-1970s (see above graph which covers the period 2008). This decline was due to negative publicity centred on side-effects of LSD use, its criminalization, and the increasing effectiveness of drug law enforcement efforts, rather than new medical information. The last country to produce LSD legally (until 1975) was Czechoslovakia; during the 1960s, high-quality LSD was imported from the communist country to California, a fact appreciated by Leary in &quot;The Politics of Ecstasy&quot;.

Victor James Kapur had the first known home grown UK &#x27;acid lab&#x27;. Up to then, all LSD had been imported from the U.S. or was remnant produce of Sandoz before it stopped producing LSD. In 1967, Kapur was caught distributing 19 grams of crystalline LSD and subsequently the police raided both of his laboratories. One was in the back room of Kapur&#x27;s chemist shop and another, larger one, was in a garage he rented from a friend of his brother-in-law.

A second group was busted in 1969. A lab in Kent, and a flat in London were raided simultaneously and quantities of equipment and LSD seized along with the two men who had been making the LSD, Quentin Theobald and Peter Simmons.

The availability of LSD had been drastically reduced by the late 1970s due to a combination of governmental controls and law enforcement. The supply of constituent chemicals including lysergic acid, which was used for production of LSD in the 1960s, and ergotamine tartrate, which was used for production in the 1970s, were placed under tight surveillance and government funding for LSD research was almost eliminated. These efforts were augmented by a series of major busts in England and Europe. One of the most famous was &quot;Operation Julie&quot; in Britain in 1978, named after the first name of the female drug squad officer involved; it broke up one of the largest LSD manufacturing and distribution operations in the world at that time, headed by chemist Richard Kemp. The group targeted by the Julie task force were reputed to have had links to the mysterious The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and to Ronald Stark.

=== Modern times ===
LSD made a comeback in the 1980s accompanying the advent of recreational MDMA use, first in the punk and gothic subcultures through dance clubs, then in the 1990s through the acid house scene and rave subculture. LSD use and availability declined sharply following a raid of a large scale LSD lab in 2000 (see LSD in the United States). The lab was run by William Leonard Pickard (who served 17 years of a two lifetime sentence in US federal prison in Tucson, AZ) and Clyde Apperson (now serving 30 years in prison). Gordon Todd Skinner, who owned the property the large scale lab had been operating on, came to the DEA looking to work as an informant. He and his then-girlfriend Krystle Cole were intimately involved in the case, but were not charged in the bust. The lab was allegedly producing a kilogram of LSD every five weeks, and the U.S. government contends that LSD supply dropped by 90% following the bust. In the decade after the bust, LSD availability and use has gradually risen. Since the late 1980s, there has also been a revival of hallucinogen research more broadly, which, in recent years, has included preclinical and clinical studies involving LSD and other compounds such as members of the 2C family compounds and psilocybin. In particular, a study released in 2012 highlighted the extraordinary effectiveness of LSD in treating alcoholism.

In November 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine reported on an increasing number of young professionals, particularly in the San Francisco area, who were using &quot;microdosing&quot; (around 10 micrograms) of LSD in an effort to &quot;work through technical problems and become more innovative.&quot; In 2018, the book &quot;How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence&quot; by Michael Pollan became a No. 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller, and &quot;How to Change Your Mind&quot;, a four-part documentary film adaptation of the book, was released in 2022. In 2020, Oregon became the first U.S. state to decriminalize possession of small amounts of LSD.

<text>Franciscus Irenicus, byname of Franz Friedlieb (1494/1495 – 1553) was a German humanist, Protestant reformer and historian.

He was born in Ettlingen and died in Gemmingen. He studied at the famous Latin school in Pforzheim, where Philipp Melanchthon was a fellow student in 1508-09. As a patriotic humanist he describes Germany in twelve books: , which appeared in Hagenau in 1518.

<text>In probability and statistics, the logarithmic distribution (also known as the logarithmic series distribution or the log-series distribution) is a discrete probability distribution derived from the Maclaurin series expansion

: formula_1

From this we obtain the identity

:formula_2

This leads directly to the probability mass function of a Log(&quot;p&quot;)-distributed random variable:

:formula_3

for &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1, and where 0 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1. Because of the identity above, the distribution is properly normalized.

The cumulative distribution function is

:formula_4

where &quot;B&quot; is the incomplete beta function.

A Poisson compounded with Log(&quot;p&quot;)-distributed random variables has a negative binomial distribution. In other words, if &quot;N&quot; is a random variable with a Poisson distribution, and &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... is an infinite sequence of independent identically distributed random variables each having a Log(&quot;p&quot;) distribution, then

:formula_5
has a negative binomial distribution. In this way, the negative binomial distribution is seen to be a compound Poisson distribution.

R. A. Fisher described the logarithmic distribution in a paper that used it to model relative species abundance.

<text>Oscar Lopez (born 1953) is a Chilean-Canadian guitarist, whose signature style blends Latin and jazz styles.

==Background==
Lopez was born in Santiago, Chile, studying music through the University of Chile&#x27;s youth music program. He moved to Canada in 1978, initially settling in Winnipeg, Manitoba before moving to Calgary, Alberta in 1981. He began pursuing music as a career, initially as an electric guitarist in a rock cover band before starting to perform as a Latin-style acoustic guitarist.

He was a regional finalist for Western Canada in the Montreal International Jazz Festival&#x27;s national &quot;Concours de Jazz&quot; in 1987.

==Music career==
He released his debut album &quot;Hola&quot; in 1989.

At the 1990 Northern Lights Festival Boréal, Lopez and singer-songwriter James Keelaghan met for the first time and began to explore the fusion of Celtic and Latin music. The duo undertook a number of tours together, and contributed as guest musicians on each other&#x27;s solo albums before recording two Juno Award-nominated albums, &quot;Compadres&quot; (1997) and &quot;¿Buddy Where You Been?&quot; (2007) as a duo.

At the Juno Awards of 1995, Lopez garnered his first nomination for Best Global Recording, for the album &quot;Dancing on the Moon Contigo&quot;.

He signed to Narada Records in 1997.

In 1998, Lopez co-produced &quot;Volcán: Tributo a José José&quot;, a tribute album dedicated to the iconic Mexican singer José José. He received a nomination for Best Instrumental Artist at the Juno Awards of 1998, the same year in which the album &quot;Compadres&quot; was nominated for Best Roots &amp; Traditional Album – Group.

At the Juno Awards of 2002, Lopez won his first award, in the Best Instrumental Album category for &quot;Armando&#x27;s Fire&quot;. He won a second Juno Award in the same category for &quot;Mi Destino/My Destiny&quot; at the Juno Awards of 2005. Around this time, however, Lopez took a break from performing for two years to deal with depression. As a result, Spirit of the West recorded a tribute song to Lopez, &quot;Come Back Oscar&quot;, on their 2004 album &quot;Star Trails&quot;. On July 24 that year, Lopez appeared on stage with Spirit of the West at the Calgary Folk Music Festival to perform the song; the following year, he returned to the stage as the festival&#x27;s headlining act.

After collaborating with Keelaghan on &quot;¿Buddy Where You Been?&quot;, which was again a Juno Award nominee for Best Instrumental Album at the Juno Awards of 2008, his next recording project was with Pavlo and Rik Emmett on the album &quot;Trifecta&quot; (2009). Credited as P.R.O., the trio toured North America in support of the CD, which was again a Juno Award nominee for Best Instrumental Album at the Juno Awards of 2010.

Lopez released his latest recording &quot;Apasionado&quot; on October 21, 2014 as an independent artist.

<text>Elizur Wright III (12 February 1804 – 22 November 1885) was an American mathematician and abolitionist. He is sometimes described in the United States as &quot;the father of life insurance&quot;, or &quot;the father of insurance regulation&quot;, as he campaigned that life insurance companies must keep reserves and provide surrender values. Wright served as an insurance commissioner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

== Early life ==
Wright was born in South Canaan, Connecticut, to a devout Christian family, who held anti-slavery beliefs and instilled in him a strict moral character. He was the first son of Elizur Wright (1762–1845), whose father was also named Elizur Wright, and his second wife Clarissa Richards (1771–1843). Wright was one of 10 children; six were half-siblings by his father&#x27;s first wife. His father was a 1781 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale College, and was known for his mathematical learning and devotion to the Calvinist faith. In 1810 the family moved to Tallmadge, Ohio, and the younger Elizur worked on the farm and attended an Academy that was conducted by his father. The famous abolitionist John Brown attended the Academy in Tallmadge with Elizur. His home served often as a refuge for fugitive slaves.

In 1826, the younger Wright graduated from Yale and began to teach: first for two years in Groton, Massachusetts, where he met and married Susan Clark, then at Hudson, Ohio, as a mathematics and natural philosophy (science) professor at Western Reserve College and Preparatory School (1829–1833), the first college in northern Ohio. It was during this time that Wright encountered the writings of William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison&#x27;s small book, &quot;Thoughts on African Colonization,&quot; persuaded Wright that slavery should immediately be abolished, and that the American Colonization Society&#x27;s effort to transport free blacks to an African colony was both unethical and impractical.

Garrison&#x27;s pamphlet and his new newspaper, &quot;The Liberator&quot;, had other influence on Western Reserve College. In 1832, College pastor and professor of sacred literature (Bible) Beriah Green preached four abolitionist sermons clearly inspired by Garrison. The uproar this created, which was followed nationally, led to Green&#x27;s resignation. Under pressure from conservative trustees, he left to become president of the Oneida Institute, where as a condition of his acceptance of the post, he was free to preach &quot;immediatism&quot;, immediate abolition. The Oneida Institute focused on preparing future abolitionists, which Green felt was a moral and religious obligation.

The school&#x27;s most distinguished professor, President Charles Backus Storrs, professor of theology, &quot;bemoaned the fact that &#x27;nothing is done in [the] college but discuss abolition and colonization&#x27;&quot;. He contracted tuberculosis, took a leave of absence, and died within six months.

This left Wright as one of two remaining professors, and it was an environment scarcely more hospitable for him than it had been for Green. The other professor, Rufus Nutting, professor of ancient languages and head of the library, was a colonizationist and cared little for abolitionism. Like Green, Wright wanted to accomplish more for the abolitionist cause than he could in Hudson.

== Abolitionist ==
Along with the brothers Lewis and Arthur Tappan, Beriah Green, Theodore Weld, James Birney, and other like-minded individuals, Wright founded the American Anti-Slavery Society at a convention in Philadelphia in December 1833, the year Wright had moved to New York City. Wright became the national secretary of the organization for five years. At this time, the American Anti-Slavery Society espoused the immediate abolition of slavery, and called for an end to racial prejudice and equality for all. To effect this change, members practiced a policy of &quot;moral suasion,&quot; an appeal to people&#x27;s ethics in an attempt to get them to embrace abolitionism and renounce slavery as sinful.

Wright edited a large number of publications, including &quot;Human Rights&quot; (1834-1835), &quot;The Emancipator&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly Anti-Slavery Magazine&quot; (1835-1838). His continued opposition to slavery incurred the enmity of its advocates, his house was once besieged by a mob, and an attempt was made to kidnap him and convey him to North Carolina. In 1838, he moved to Boston, where he became editor of the &quot;Massachusetts Abolitionist&quot; in April 1839. In 1846 he established the &quot;Chronotype&quot; newspaper, which he conducted until it was absorbed by the &quot;Commonwealth&quot; (1850), of which also he was for a time the editor.

He was also involved in &quot;The Great Postal Campaign&quot;a project whose job was to distribute abolitionist material across the country. The Anti-Slavery Society was successful in recruiting agents throughout the country to spread their message, but when Garrison and others began to broaden the scope of the Society to include women&#x27;s rights and took on an anti-religion, anti-government tone, Wright and others objected and began to split from the Society in 1840.

Wright became involved with the newly created Liberty Party and began to separate from the evangelists and the religious anti-slavery movements, believing that government intervention was the way to abolition. Wright was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that assisted fugitive slaves. He was arrested and charged for aiding in the 1851 escape of Shadrach Minkins, the first black man to be seized in New England under the Fugitive Slave Act. He was not convicted. Wright was also indicted and tried for libel in consequence of his severe words for the liquor interests while publishing the &quot;Chronotype&quot;.

Wright eventually became estranged from the abolitionist movement. Moreover, due partially to disappointment in his church&#x27;s lack of support for the abolitionist cause, and to a slowly growing desire to find secular solutions to social problems, the formerly pious and devout Congregationalist distanced himself from the church. Eventually, Wright became an atheist.

== Inventions ==

Between 1853 and 1858, besides editing the &quot;Railroad Times&quot;, he gave his attention to invention and mechanics, constructing a spike-making machine, a water faucet, and an improvement in pipe coupling. He patented the last two, and manufactured them for a short time.

== Life insurance ==
According to Frank Preston Stearns, Wright became interested in life insurance as a mathematical study and read &quot;the best works on life insurance ... with the same ardor with which young ladies devour an exciting novel.&quot;

In the spring of 1852 an insurance broker placed an advertising booklet in his hand wherein Elizur Wright looked it over and perceived quickly enough that no company could undertake to do what this one pretended to and remain solvent. At age 40, Wright visited the Royal Exchange in London to investigate the life insurance industry. It was on this trip where he saw an advertisement in the Daily Telegraph for the Sale of 42 Old Life Insurance Policies in which old men were auctioning off their life insurance policies to investors after faithfully paying premiums all their lives. Elizur recognized that these life insurance policy owners were too old to work and could no longer afford their premium payments but were not yet dead to collect the benefit. As a result, the policy owners looked to speculators or investors. Wright recognized and wrote about the fact that life insurance policy owners were not able to obtain as much as half of the value that should be in these policies in his book Politics and Mysteries of Life Insurance.

To Wright, this was unconscionable, and upon his return to America, he began campaigning for a cleanup of the life insurance business, by requiring insurers to pay “surrender values” to policyholders on request and to hold adequate reserves to do so. Wright realized how easy it was to for insurance carriers to cheat, so he devised formulas for calculating the reserves and created statutory capital requirements for the industry. Ultimately, the life insurance industry accepted Wright&#x27;s reforms. Wright served as an insurance commissioner for the State of Massachusetts from 1858 to 1866.

He devised a new formula for finding the values of policies of various terms, known as the “accumulation formula,” and, in order to facilitate his work, invented and afterward patented (1869) the “arithmeter,” a mechanical contrivance for multiplication and division, based on the logarithmic principle, a form of cylindrical slide rule.

== Public parks ==
Wright, a member of the Forestry Association, was instrumental in obtaining the Massachusetts Forestry Act of 1882. He initiated and promoted plans for making Middlesex Fells, an area north of Boston bordering Malden and Melrose, into a public park; although he did not succeed during his lifetime, the plan was carried out later and Middlesex Fells is Middlesex Fells Reservation to this day.

==Other activities==
Wright served as an officer of the National Liberal League.

Along with his rationalist approach to insurance and religion, Wright was an ardent advocate of a phonetic writing system he called &quot;phonotypy.&quot; A column written in this system appeared in almost every issue of his newspaper, the &quot;Chronotype&quot; (1846-1850).
