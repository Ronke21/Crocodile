<text>True Blue is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on June 30, 1986, by Sire Records. In early 1985, Madonna became romantically involved with actor Sean Penn, and married him six months later on her 27th birthday. Additionally, she met producer Patrick Leonard while on the Virgin Tour, and formed a professional relationship with him. The first songs they created together were &quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot;, and the ballad &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, which was featured on &quot;At Close Range&quot;, a film in which Penn starred. 

In late 1985, Madonna and Leonard began working on her third studio album; she also enlisted the help of former boyfriend Stephen Bray, with whom she had worked on her previous record &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984). Titled &quot;True Blue&quot;, the record saw Madonna co-writing and co-producing for the first time in her career. Inspired by Madonna&#x27;s love for Penn, to whom she dedicated it, &quot;True Blue&quot; is a dance-pop album that features influences of Motown sound, girl groups, and Latin pop.

Upon release, the album was well received by critics, who complimented Madonna&#x27;s vocals and musical growth. It was an immediate global success, reaching number one in a record-breaking 28 countries across the world. With over 25 million copies sold worldwide, &quot;True Blue&quot; is the best-selling album of 1986, the best-selling of the 1980s by a female artist, and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Five singles were released from the album ―all reached the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with three going to number one. 

The album was promoted on Madonna&#x27;s second concert tour, 1987&#x27;s Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour, which visited cities in Asia, North America, and Europe. &quot;True Blue&quot; is credited as the album that established Madonna&#x27;s position as the biggest female artist of the 1980s, rivaling male musicians like Michael Jackson and Prince. It is also considered the album that made her an icon and artist.

== Background ==

In February 1985, Madonna began dating actor Sean Penn, whom she met in the set of the music video for her single &quot;Material Girl&quot;. She recalled that Penn was someone &quot;whose work I’d admired, and I think he felt the same way [...] We have so much in common he is almost like my brother&quot;. They dated casually and married six months later, on Madonna&#x27;s 27th birthday. Afterwards, the newlyweds starred together in a movie called &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; (1986), which was a critical and commercial failure.

Madonna met producer Patrick Leonard while on the Virgin Tour, where he was hired as musical director. After the tour was finished, Madonna asked Leonard if he wanted to work with her. They met at a barbecue in his house, where he showed her a song he&#x27;d created in his studio called &quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot;, which Madonna sang at the Philadelphia Live Aid benefit concert on July 13, 1985. Leonard and Madonna&#x27;s next collaboration was a ballad called &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, which was conceived as an instrumental for the score of Paramount&#x27;s film &quot;Fire with Fire&quot; (1986). Paramount, however, rejected the track; Leonard then asked Madonna if she could write the lyrics. She complied, and decided to use the track on &quot;At Close Range&quot;, a movie starring Penn.

On April 5, 1986, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Madonna&#x27;s new album would be called &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, and released in the summer. One month later, the title was confirmed to be &quot;True Blue&quot;, named after a favorite expression Penn&#x27;s. Described by the singer as her &quot;most personal&quot; work at the time, she wanted to reach a wider, more mature audience. Pleased with the results of &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, she chose to keep Leonard on the project, and also enlisted former boyfriend Stephen Bray, with whom she had worked on her second album &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984), and felt could help her create &quot;up-tempo songs with a classic Top 40 sensibility&quot;.

== Development ==

&quot;True Blue&quot; was recorded at the Channel Studios in Los Angeles, from December 1985 to April 1986, the first year of Madonna and Penn&#x27;s marriage. For the first time in her career, Madonna co-wrote and co-produced all of the album&#x27;s tracks. According to Leonard, she was &quot;very much in love&quot; and in control when creating the record. The singer worked with Bray and Leonard separately, with the three meeting together only once. Leonard recalled the recording process: &quot;I would put something together, usually just on piano, and then [Madonna] would come in, we&#x27;d mess around with whatever needed to be messed around with, she’d write a lyric, she’d sing it, and the next day we would do another song, one a day&quot;. On the other hand, Bray&#x27;s job was to &quot;shape things and [...] create arrangements to show off the song[s] better&quot;. &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; was the first track recorded for the album; it was created as a rock and roll song titled &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; by Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson for singer Cyndi Lauper. Madonna&#x27;s team got a demo with songs from Cole&#x27;s management, among them &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot;; she liked the track, changed the title, re-wrote some of the lyrics, and produced it alongside Leonard. They added a bassline underneath, changing it from a rock song into a dance one.

&quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was written by Brian Elliott for a singer named Cristina Dent. When Elliot played Dent&#x27;s tracks for Warner&#x27;s Michael Ostin, the same A&amp;R executive who discovered &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, Ostin asked if he could play the track for Madonna; Elliot had been working with Dent for six months and was reluctant to let the song go to another artist, but he eventually gave in, finding the idea of Madonna recording his song &quot;hard to resist&quot;. With lyrics that talk about teenage pregnancy, Madonna was attracted to the track because it &quot;fit right in with my own personal zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities&quot;. She only contributed with additional lyrics, making &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; the only song on the album that she did not have a strong hand in writing. &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; marked a &quot;stylistic shift&quot; for Madonna, as it was her first song to incorporate Latin motifs, and lyrics in Spanish. It was created by Leonard as an instrumental and offered to Michael Jackson, who turned it down. After meeting with the singer to start working on &quot;True Blue&quot;, Leonard presented her the demo and she wrote the lyrics while filming &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot;. To get the correct translations, him and Madonna talked over the phone with a Hispanic housekeeper. It was described as a tribute to &quot;the beauty and mystery of Latin American people&quot;. &quot;Where&#x27;s the Party&quot; is the only track that saw Madonna, Bray and Leonard working together. Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens-Crowder, the authors of Madonna&#x27;s 1983 hit &quot;Holiday&quot;, wrote a song called &quot;Spotlight&quot; for the album, that was recorded but ultimately not included. Madonna dedicated &quot;True Blue&quot; to Penn, &quot;the coolest guy in the universe&quot;.

== Composition ==

Daryl Easlea, author of &quot;Madonna: Blond Ambition&quot;, described &quot;True Blue&quot; as a &quot;girlish&quot; album, &quot;the sound of a woman in love&quot;. Made up of &quot;highly commercial dance-pop [with] lyrics [that] convey an upbeat message along with casual autobiographical references&quot;, it contains musical references to Motown sound and girl groups. Her love for Penn &quot;seep[s] into every song&quot;, as noted by author Lucy O&#x27;Brien. Adam Sexton pointed out that, &quot;[Madonna] transforms her own marital bliss into high-school accessible scenarios of a girl breaking down a bad boy&#x27;s defense&quot;. Opener &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; is a dance post-disco track, with lyrics that see a daughter telling her father she is pregnant and refuses to have an abortion or give up the baby for adoption, despite her friends&#x27; advice. The strings in the introduction nod to classical and Baroque music. The following track, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, is a &quot;simple&quot; &quot;dizzy, driving&quot; dance-pop love song &quot;brimming with sexual innuendo&quot;. Lyrically, it is a &quot;tale of an unrequited love for someone seen on the street&quot;, and begins with Madonna whispering &quot;watch out!&quot; just as the opening drums kick in.

Third track &quot;White Heat&quot; was dedicated to actor James Cagney and named after the 1949 film of the same name. It is a &quot;standard&quot; uptempo dance track, with synth bass and doubletracked vocals; also present are two quotes from the original soundtrack, &quot;with speech and gunshots&quot;, one at the beginning and one towards the end. &quot;Live to Tell&quot; is a pop ballad whose background instrumentation features a keyboard, a synthesizer, electric guitar and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. Lyrically, it talks about the complexity of deceit, mistrust, and &quot;bearing the burden of some enigmatic secret and coping with a painful past&quot;. Fifth track &quot;Where&#x27;s the Party&quot; is a dance song described by Madonna herself as a statement about &quot;what it&#x27;s like to be in the middle of this press stuff with everybody on my back&quot;. Inspired by Motown and girl groups from the 1960s, title track &quot;True Blue&quot; is Madonna&#x27;s tribute to Penn. The verse-and-chorus composition is reminiscent of that of The Dixie Cups&#x27; &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; (1964), with backup singers Siedah Garrett and Edie Lehman accompanying Madonna&#x27;s convincing &quot;girly&quot; vocals like a choir.

&quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; combines flamenco guitar, Latin percussion, electronic sounds, and maracas. Lyrically, it talks about a &quot;humble observer, captured by the rhythm of an imagined island&quot; named San Pedro, with mentions of &quot;tropical breeze&quot; and &quot;nature wild and free&quot;. It starts with an introduction performed on bongos, before descending into castanets. Madonna then utters the phrase &quot;¿Cómo puede ser verdad?&quot; (&quot;How can it be true?&quot;). In one line, she specifically sings, &quot;Last night I dreamt of San Pedro/Just like I&#x27;d never gone, I knew the song&quot;. One of the album&#x27;s &quot;happiest&quot; cuts is &quot;Jimmy Jimmy&quot;, which has influences of new wave music. In the lyrics, Madonna commemorates her &quot;youthful fascination&quot; with actor James Dean; &quot;I used to fantasize that we grew up in the same neighbourhood and that he moved away and became a big star&quot;, she recalled. Closer &quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot; incorporates Latin drums and samba-influenced rhythms, and lyrics that talk about anti-war and anti-poverty.

== Artwork and release ==

The album cover was shot by photographer Herb Ritts. It shows Madonna in profile, with her head thrown back and eyes closed against a sky-blue background; her skin is bleached-out, and her hair platinum blonde. Jeri Heiden, who was working at the Warner Bros. art department, was given the task of editing the photos to adapt them into record covers. The final photo was selected by Madonna, Heiden and Jeff Ayeroff, creative director of Warner Bros. at that time. After the image was chosen, Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the original, which was shot in black and white, to go along with the album&#x27;s title, and finally arrived at the final, blue toned, hand tinted version. The album&#x27;s inner sleeve did not feature any photographs, and instead was dedicated to album credits and song lyrics, since Madonna wanted to be represented by her work rather than her image.

Lucy O&#x27;Brien described the cover as a &quot;moment of Warholian pop art. A mixture of innocence [and] idealism [...] Our first glimpse of Madonna as a classic icon&quot;. For J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of &quot;&quot;, the artwork indicated how &quot;[&quot;True Blue&quot;] was a vehicle of growth for [Madonna]&quot;; the &quot;washed out color photograph&quot; cover was &quot;understated&quot;, especially when compared to the &quot;sexier poses&quot; she had been associated with in the past. For Joe Lynch from &quot;Billboard&quot;, it is one of the greatest album covers of all time.

&quot;True Blue&quot; was released on June 30, 1986. In the United States and Canada, the cover did not include the singer&#x27;s name. Heiden explained in an interview with &quot;Aperture&quot; magazine that the record company thought it would be &quot;cool&quot; to use a shrink wrap on American releases, so that when the public took it off, they&#x27;d be left with the photograph of Madonna. In Europe, Warner felt that the name was needed, as they did not want to risk messing with Madonna&#x27;s popularity. The back sleeve and booklet feature the song titles in Heiden&#x27;s own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and vinyl releases, Heiden said: &quot;I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square—and at that time we always started with the album cover configuration. It was like she was floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue—Goddess like. In the vertical cropping you see her leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly&quot;. On May 22, 2001, Warner Bros. released a remastered edition of the album with two additional remixes of &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. Twenty years later, a 35th anniversary edition was released; it includes additional remixes, dub and instrumental versions. It was reissued on crystal clear vinyl on November 8, 2019.

== Promotion ==
=== Tour ===
&quot;True Blue&quot; was promoted on 1987&#x27;s Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour, Madonna&#x27;s second concert tour. It was her first world tour, and marked her first visit to Europe and Asia. Musically and technically superior to the Virgin Tour, with a larger stage and four huge video screens used as backdrops, it was described by Madonna herself as a &quot;theatrical multimedia spectacular&quot;. Collaborating with Marlene Stewart on the wardrobe, she expanded the idea of &quot;bringing her popular video characters to life onstage&quot;, recreating scenes from &quot;True Blue&quot;, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. Who&#x27;s That Girl was critically appreciated, with reviewers singling out the performances, Madonna&#x27;s vocals and confidence as a performer. The tour&#x27;s performance of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; marked her first conflict with the Vatican, as she dedicated it to Pope John Paul II, who urged Italian fans to boycott the concerts in the country. With a total gross of US$25 million, Who&#x27;s That Girl was the second most successful female tour of the year, behind Tina Turner&#x27;s Break Every Rule World Tour.

=== Singles ===
In the United States, &quot;Live to Tell&quot; was released on March 26, 1986, whereas in Europe, the release date was April 14. It was acclaimed by critics, with some deeming it Madonna&#x27;s best ballad, and singling out her vocal performance. It was also commercially successful, becoming the singer&#x27;s third number one in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and her first number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows the singer in a more demure, toned down appearance, inspired by actresses such as Grace Kelly, intercut with clips from &quot;At Close Range&quot;.

On June 11, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was released as &quot;True Blue&quot;″s second single in the United States; in Europe, it was issued five days later.
It was lauded by critics, who applauded its hook, maturity, and referred to it as a milestone in Madonna&#x27;s career. It reached the top spot of the Hot 100 ―her fourth number one there― the United Kingdom, and Australia. The clip, also directed by Foley, shows the singer in her first &quot;head-to-toe&quot; image makeover, with a leaner, more toned body, and cropped platinum blonde hair. Its main storyline has Madonna trying to tell her father, about her pregnancy; these scenes are juxtaposed with shots of her dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend. Shortly after its release, the song caused heated discussions about its lyrical content. Women&#x27;s organizations and others in the family planning field criticized Madonna for encouraging teenage pregnancy, while groups opposed to abortion saw the song as having a positive anti-abortion message.

Title track &quot;True Blue&quot; was released as third single; first on Europe on September 29, and then in the United States on October 9. It was generally well received by music critics, who praised its retro-inspired sound and felt it was a throwback to girl groups. &quot;True Blue&quot; topped the charts in the United Kingdom, and reached the third position of the Hot 100. Two music videos were shot for the single: the official one was directed by Foley and shows Madonna with three dancers and a 1950s car in an all-blue diner. An alternate video was made through MTV&#x27;s &quot;Make My Video&quot; contest; the three entries selected portrayed a fifties-style production, and made allusion to the song&#x27;s theme.

Released in the US on November 12, 1986, and in Europe on December 1, fourth single &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; gave Madonna her fifth number one in Hot 100; she became the second female artist – behind Whitney Houston – to score three number ones from one album. The song received positive reviews from critics and was deemed a highlight from the album. Its accompanying music video, directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, depicts Madonna as an exotic dancer at a peep show who befriends a little boy. Critical reception towards the clip was generally positive: the singer was praised for presenting women as the dominant sex, but the plot of a child entering a strip club received criticism.

The last single from the album was &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, released on February 25, 1987. Critics reacted positively to the song and applauded its Latin-influenced sound. Peaking at number 4, it was Madonna&#x27;s eleventh top five hit on the Hot 100, a feat surpassed at the time only by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; also gave the singer her second Adult Contemporary number one. Mary Lambert directed the music video, which shows Madonna as two opposite characters – a young Catholic woman, and a flamenco dancer. Despite not being released as a single, &quot;Where&#x27;s The Party&quot; received airplay on radio station WKSI &quot;Kiss FM&quot; due to demand from the public.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;True Blue&quot; was generally well received by critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it was &quot;one of the great dance-pop albums&quot;, that showcases Madonna&#x27;s skills as a &quot;songwriter, record-maker, provocateur, and entertainer through its wide reach, accomplishment, and sheer sense of fun&quot;. This opinion was echoed by the staff of &quot;Billboard&quot;, who were impressed with the &quot;confident&quot; album, and the singer&#x27;s growth as writer and producer. Erika Wexler from &quot;Spin&quot; wrote: &quot;Madonna knows her days as the chanteuse for teenage romance are numbered. With perfect timing, [she] gently distanced herself from that role, and although some of the songs [on &quot;True Blue&quot;] have the sophistication of a training bra, there are glowing moments&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Stephen Holden noted that, despite lacking the &quot;gleaming ultra-sleek aural surfaces&quot; of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot;″s made up of &quot;shrewdly crafted teen-age and pre-teen-age ditties that reveal Madonna&#x27;s unfailing commercial instincts&quot;, and find her singing with &quot;a lot more heart&quot;. This opinion was shared by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where Davitt Sigerson referred to &quot;True Blue&quot; as a &quot;sturdy, dependable, lovable&quot; album, and singled out the singer&#x27;s voice for sounding &quot;better than ever&quot;.

Robert Hilburn from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, pointed out that the &quot;most obvious growth&quot; was Madonna&#x27;s voice, which is &quot;so finely tailored that she actually extends the punch and appeal of the production touches&quot;. He went on to say: &quot;&quot;True Blue&quot; isn&#x27;t revolutionary music, but it is imaginative, highly energized pop that recognizes the limitations and pleasures of Top 40 fare&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Peter Piatkowski also applauded the singer&#x27;s more mature vocals, and deemed the record &quot;brilliant, one that speaks to its time but also celebrates the disparate cultures that influence [Madonna&#x27;s] sound at the moment&quot;. &quot;True Blue&quot; is the &quot;most polished&quot; of Madonna&#x27;s first three albums, according to El Hunt from the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. In the same vein, Mary Von Aue from &quot;Stereogum&quot; said it has &quot;more vocal range and lyrical complexities&quot; than &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Madonna&quot;. &quot;True Blue&quot; was hailed &quot;nine tracks of 80s pop perfection [...] Madonna’s strongest effort from that decade&quot; by the staff of &quot;Gay Times&quot;. For Joseph Earp from Australian website Junkee, &quot;with its era-defining production, and sweaty sheen of subversion, [&quot;True Blue&quot; is] the singer&#x27;s way of understanding everything that came afterwards [...] most pop singers never release a record this good in their whole career&quot;.

Lucy O&#x27;Brien pointed out that, whereas her debut and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; were a &quot;sound in development&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot; sees Madonna &quot;nail[ing] her signature style - rhythmic, dramatic, danceable, and distinctively melodic&quot;. Replacing Nile Rodgers with Leonard and Bray resulted in a &quot;less polished, but more varied&quot; album, according to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;″s Larry Nager. The review ended on a somewhat critical note: &quot;True Blue&quot; is &quot;classic pop [...] an entertaining album&#x27;s worth of catchy, danceable tunes&quot;, despite &quot;not much content beneath the candy-coating&quot;, concluded Nager. Even though he called it a &quot;supreme archetype of &#x27;80s pop music&quot;, with its tracks being &quot;undeniably more mature&quot; than her previous endeavors, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani felt &quot;True Blue&quot; is home to &quot;some of [Madonna&#x27;s] biggest clunkers&quot;, and is &quot;undeniably of its time&quot;. To Karen Cooke from Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;, even though it includes a couple of &quot;tedious&quot; tracks, &quot;this record is full of songs to make you tap the steering wheel [and] dance in the loungeroom&quot;. &quot;True Blue&quot;″s main flaw is that its five singles are &quot;so strong they overshadow&quot; the rest of the tracks, which seem &quot;slight by comparison&quot;, wrote Daryl Easlea. 

In less favorable reviews, John Quayle from the &quot;Observer–Reporter&quot; dismissed the record as &quot;warmed over Go-Gos material&quot;, but applauded the singles for being &quot;strong enough to convince even her worst critics that Madonna does have talent - and lots of it&quot;. Mary Von Aue noted that the album experiments with &quot;different sounds that are well executed as singles&quot;, but as a whole sounds &quot;disjointed&quot;, concluding that, &quot;[&quot;True Blue&quot;] doesn’t live up to the strength of [its singles]&quot;. For Don McLeese from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, although it represents a &quot;valiant -and necessary- attempt on Madonna&#x27;s part to expand her artistic range, &quot;True Blue&quot; just isn&#x27;t as much fun&quot; as her previous records. The &quot;Record-Journal&quot;″s Jim Zebora was also negative: &quot;[&quot;True Blue&quot;] contains one absolutely marvelous torch song called &#x27;Live To Tell&#x27; [...] Unfortunately, the rest is barely competent post-disco [...] So let&#x27;s call it a C plus and program the CD player to ignore eight out of [its] nine songs&quot;. Finally, Larry Kilman, writing for American newspaper &quot;The Evening News&quot;, compared it negatively to the work of girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri-Las, dismissing it as &quot;mindless, inspid [and] air-headed&quot;, adding that, &quot;[its] slick production and arrangements disguise much of the tininess of [Madonna&#x27;s] voice [...] But that&#x27;s as good as [&quot;True Blue&quot;] gets&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
On July 19, 1986, &quot;True Blue&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 29. Five weeks later, it reached the first spot; it was Madonna&#x27;s second number one album after &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, thus she became one of five female artists in the rock era to reach the top spot with back-to-back releases. It stayed on the top position for five consecutive weeks, and on the chart for a total of 82 weeks. &quot;True Blue&quot; was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of over seven million units, making it Madonna&#x27;s third best-selling album in the United States, behind &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990). With the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 404,000 copies as of August 2010. 301,000 additional copies were sold through BMG Music Clubs, which are not counted by the Nielsen SoundScan. In Canada, &quot;True Blue&quot; debuted on the 73rd spot of the &quot;RPM&quot; Albums Chart on July 5, 1986; it quickly climbed up the chart and reached the top on August 9. By July, it had surpassed the 10-times-platinum mark for 1 million sales Canadian, and was eventually certified diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for shipment of one million copies. Madonna became the second female artist to achieve this behind Whitney Houston.

In Argentina, the album reached the chart&#x27;s top spot and was certified four-times platinum by the Cámara Argentina de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (CAPIF) for shipment of over 240,000 copies. In Brazil, &quot;True Blue&quot; sold 205,000 copies during its first-two weeks, and reached the chart&#x27;s first spot; with sales of 680,000 units, it was one of the best-selling albums in 1987, and received a gold cerification by the Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos (ABPD). With over 1 million copies sold, &quot;True Blue&quot; remains as the best-selling album in Brazil by an international female artist.

In Japan, the album peaked at number one on the Oricon chart. At the 1987 Japan Gold Disc Awards, held by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), &quot;True Blue&quot; received &quot;Album of the Year Pop Solo&quot; and &quot;Grand Prix Album of the Year&quot;, which was given for the year&#x27;s best-selling international album, while Madonna was honored the &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; for being the year&#x27;s best-selling international artist. In Hong Kong, the album was certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). In Australia, &quot;True Blue&quot; remained on the first spot of the Kent Music Report for two weeks. Additionally, it was certified four times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 280,000 copies. Similarly, it reached number one in New Zealand and was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for shipment of 75,000 copies.

Across Europe, &quot;True Blue&quot; sold 5 million copies by July 1987, and reached the top of the European Top 100 Albums chart. It spent a total of 31 weeks at number one, from July 19, 1986, to March 7, 1987, the longest number one album runner in the history of the European charts. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart on July 12, 1986, making it the first album by an American artist to debut at number one in British chart history. It spent six weeks at the top, shifting just shy of two million by the end of the year, and was 1986&#x27;s best selling album. &quot;True Blue&quot; was certified seven times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 2.1 million copies and, as of June 2019, has sold over two million copies. &quot;True Blue&quot; also topped the albums chart in France and received a diamond certification by the Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for shipment of one million copies. Actual sales of the album in the country stand at 1,300,000 copies as of March 2012. Similarly, in Germany &quot;True Blue&quot; also reached the first spot in Germany, and was certified two times platinum by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for shipment of one million copies. It reached the first spot of the charts in Italy, Belgium, Spain, and Switzerland. According to biographer Christopher Andersen, &quot;True Blue&quot; went gold in countries where it didn&#x27;t even reached number one. By August 1987, &quot;True Blue&quot; had sold over five million copies; worldwide, it has sold more than 25 million copies.

== Legacy ==

&quot;True Blue&quot; has been noted as the album that made Madonna an icon and a &quot;credible&quot; artist. Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed it the point where she &quot;truly became &#x27;Madonna the superstar&#x27;—the endlessly ambitious, fearlessly provocative entertainer that knew how to outrage, spark debates, get good reviews—and make good music while she&#x27;s at it&quot;. From the BBC, Mark Savage wrote that it established her as &quot;the first lady of pop&quot;, an opinion that was shared by Peter Piatkowski, who added that it made her the &quot;dominant face on the Mount Rushmore of 1980s pop&quot;, along with Michael Jackson, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. In a similar note, Sal Cinquemani said that with &quot;True Blue&quot;, Madonna joined the ranks of Jackson and Prince and made the transition from &quot;pop tart to consummate artist&quot;. According to Lucy O&#x27;Brien, &quot;with its sophisticated sheen, [&quot;True Blue&quot;] took Madonna firmly out of the dance-diva category into a global pop market&quot;. Jack White from the Official Charts Company wrote: &quot;&quot;True Blue&quot;, her third album, saw Madonna shoot into the realms of superstardom that her previous album &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; had cemented&quot;. To Matthew Rettenmund, author of &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot;, it was the first &quot;solid proof&quot; of her artistic and musical talents. Patrick Leonard himself explained: &quot;The music got more serious, so I think she got taken more seriously [...] [Madonna] took some chances that I don’t know most people would have. There were things [in &quot;True Blue&quot;] that weren’t normal in pop music at the time&quot;.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; considered &quot;True Blue&quot; one of the best albums from the 1980s; Jonathan Keefe wrote that it marked the point where, &quot;it became readily apparent that Madonna was more than just a flash-in-the-pan pop star. It&#x27;s when she began manipulating her image —and her audience— with a real sense of clarity and purpose&quot;. Piatkowski wrote that it &quot;set the stage for the exponential ascent of Madonna&#x27;s brilliance&quot;, that began with 1989&#x27;s &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and reached its peak on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. From music portal Albumism, Justin Chadwick conlcuded that, &quot;[&quot;True Blue&quot;] solidified [Madonna&#x27;s] blonde ambition, cemented her worldwide superstardom, and, once and for all, extinguished any remaining doubts about her potential career longevity&quot;. The album also helped popularize marketing singles, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Paul Grein: &quot;10 or 20 years ago you would have had two singles from an album at the most. Now we’re in an era where Madonna is on her fifth [from &quot;True Blue&quot;]&quot;.

&quot;True Blue&quot; was 1986&#x27;s best-selling album, and the best-selling of the 1980s decade by a female artist, with Madonna being 1986&#x27;s most successful female. The album held the record for being number one in a total of 28 countries around the world. With over 17 million copies sold, it was named the highest-seller of all time by a female in the 1991 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;; &quot;True Blue&quot; has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, and is one of the best-selling albums of all time.

<doc id="1136217" wikidata="Q521755" url="?curid=1136217" title="Duncan Oughton">
<text>Duncan Oughton (born 14 June 1977) is a retired New Zealand association football player. Oughton played professionally in the United States for Major League Soccer club Columbus Crew and represented New Zealand internationally. He was an assistant coach for Toronto FC until 31 October 2014, when the team let Ryan Nelsen and five of his assistant coaches go. Today he is the host of the TV series &quot;Soccer &amp; Beer&quot;.

==Career==

===Youth and college===
Oughton attended the University of Otago in New Zealand, before moving to the United States to play college soccer at Cal State Fullerton from 1997 to 2000. As a senior as CS Fullerton, he scored 17 goals and was credited with 8 assists.

===Professional===
Upon graduating, Oughton was selected 10th overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by Columbus Crew. Oughton immediately found playing time with the Crew, playing 20 games as a rookie, including 12 starts. He maintained a starting role for the Crew for the majority of his early career, in part due to his ability to play numerous positions in the midfield and defence. Oughton missed the entire 2005 season with a knee injury and was released in May 2006. However, he continued to train with the team, and in August 2006 the team waived Leonard Bisaku and re-signed Oughton. However, Oughton&#x27;s playing time with the Crew became more sporadic; he made just nine first team appearances in 2006 and only five in 2008. In 2009, Oughton scored a bicycle kick goal against USL 1st Division Rochester Rhinos in a US Open Cup match, however, the Crew lost in penalties, with Oughton&#x27;s being saved. In the 2009 MLS season, Oughton had been given the chance to be back in the first team and was rewarded with two straight starts, earning an assist.

After the 2010 MLS season Columbus declined Oughton&#x27;s contract option, and he elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Oughton became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft.

On 3 February 2011, Oughton announced his retirement from playing and was hired as the assistant technical director for Columbus.

===International===
Oughton has represented the New Zealand national team, on numerous occasions. He received his first cap in 2002 in a win over Tahiti in the Oceania Nations Cup and went on to make 25 appearances and score 2 goals in A-internationals.

He was a member of New Zealand&#x27;s 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup squad, and had a second taste of the big tournament atmosphere when he was named as part of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup squad to travel to South Africa. His final appearance for New Zealand was as a second-half substitute in the 2–0 loss to South Africa on 17 June 2009.

===International goals===
==Coaching career==
After retiring, Oughton joined the staff of the Crew, serving as an assistant coach in addition to serving as assistant technical director. He also served as analyst on regional television broadcasts of the club on Ohio News Network and later Fox Sports Ohio. In March 2013, Oughton was a candidate to replace Ricki Herbert as head coach of the Wellington Phoenix. During the 2013 season, he left Columbus to join the staff of Toronto FC, where he serves as an assistant to former international teammate Ryan Nelsen. Oughton holds a &quot;B&quot; license by the United States Soccer Federation.

== Television career ==
Since 2015, Oughton has been the host and a producer for the show &quot;Soccer &amp; Beer&quot;. The show centers around him exploring soccer cultures around the world and the drinks people celebrate with.

==Honors==

===Columbus Crew===
*Major League Soccer MLS Cup (1): 2008
*Major League Soccer Supporters Shield (3): 2004, 2008, 2009
*Lamar Hunt US Open Cup (1): 2002

<text>Victoria Dock was a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated in the northern dock system, it was connected to Trafalgar Dock to the north and West Waterloo Dock to the south. 

==History==
The dock was designed by Jesse Hartley and opened in 1836, on the same day as Trafalgar Dock. The dock was named after Princess Victoria, the heir apparent to William IV, and was one of the last opened specifically for sailing ships. Victoria Dock originally had its own river entrance, which was closed in 1846. 

Between 1844 and 1921, the Ordnance Datum for the British Isles was taken from the level of the Victoria Dock. The dock was altered in 1848. By 1858, the largest share of the dock&#x27;s trade was with America. The dock was unmodernised until 1929.

In 1972 the body of the dock was filled in as part of the construction of a ferry terminal for the B&amp;I Line. The remainder of the dock was closed in 1988.

<doc id="1136223" wikidata="Q2261659" url="?curid=1136223" title="Scrimshaw">
<text>Scrimshaw is scrollwork, engravings, and carvings done in bone or ivory. Typically it refers to the artwork created by whalers, engraved on the byproducts of whales, such as bones or cartilage. It is most commonly made out of the bones and teeth of sperm whales, the baleen of other whales, and the tusks of walruses.

It takes the form of elaborate engravings in the form of pictures and lettering on the surface of the bone or tooth, with the engraving highlighted using a pigment, or, less often, small sculptures made from the same material. However, the latter really fall into the categories of ivory carving, for all carved teeth and tusks, or bone carving. The making of scrimshaw probably began on whaling ships in the late 18th century and survived until the ban on commercial whaling. The practice survives as a hobby and as a trade for commercial artisans. A maker of scrimshaw is known as a &quot;scrimshander&quot;. The word first appeared in the logbook of the brig &quot;By Chance&quot; in 1826, but the etymology is uncertain.

==History and materials==

Scrimshaw developed from the practice of sailors on whaling ships creating common tools, where the byproducts of whales were readily available. The term originally referred to the making of these tools, only later referring to works of art created by whalers in their spare time. Whale bone was ideally suited for the task, as it is easy to work and was plentiful.

The widespread carving of scrimshaw was enabled when the 1815 publication of the journal of U.S. Navy Captain David Porter disclosed both the market and the source of the whale teeth, causing a surplus of whale teeth that greatly diminished their value and made them available as a material for ordinary seamen. Around this time is the earliest authenticated pictorial piece of sperm whale scrimshaw (1817). The tooth was inscribed: &quot;This is the tooth of a sperm whale that was caught near the Galápagos Islands by the crew of the ship Adam [of London], and made 100 barrels of oil in the year 1817.&quot;

Other sea animal ivories were used as alternatives to the rarer whale teeth. Walrus tusks, for example, may have been acquired in trade from indigenous walrus hunters.

Scrimshaw was a leisure activity for creative whalers. Life aboard a whaling ship often included long stretches of time between whale sightings, which gave those onboard a great deal of free time for creative pursuits.

Early scrimshaw was done with sailing needles or other sharp implements, and the movement of the ship, as well as the skill of the artist, produced drawings of varying levels of detail and artistry. Typically, readily available pigments onboard a whaleship like candle black, soot, or tobacco juice were used to bring the etched design into view. Ink, while used in some cases, was a more expensive and rarer option for this purpose. Many surviving examples of scrimshaw are unsigned, and a great many of the pieces are anonymous.

Today&#x27;s artists use finer tools in various sizes, mostly borrowed from the dental industry. Some scrimshanders ink their work with more than one color, and restrained polychromed examples of this art are now popular.

Originating in an era when sperm whales were plentiful, only to be hunted to near collapse, scrimshaw is no longer an artform utilizing an easily renewable animal resource, but one that is susceptible to contraband. The Endangered Species Act and international conventions restricted the harvest and sale of ivory in an effort to bolster populations of ivory-bearing animals.
* Though there are sources of ivory that are sanctioned and legal, poachers in Africa and other continents where elephants are an endangered species still kill for their ivory. Elephant ivory has been regulated since 1976 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and selling African ivory has been prohibited since 1989.
* 19th and 20th century scrimshaw crafted before 1989 (elephant) or before 1973 (sperm whale ivory, walrus ivory etc.) is legal. It is prohibited after those years for commercial import in the U.S. under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
* Walrus tusks bearing the Alaska State walrus ivory registration tag, and post-law walrus ivory that has been carved or scrimshawed by an indigenous Alaskan, is legal.
* Ancient ivory, such as 10,000- to 40,000-year-old mammoth or fossilized walrus ivory, is unrestricted in its sale or possession under federal law.

Scrimshanders and collectors acquire legal whale teeth and marine tusks through estate sales, auctions and antique dealers. To avoid illegal ivory, collectors and artists check provenance and deal only with established and reputable dealers. Scrimshaw that is found to have been illegally sourced may be seized by customs officials worldwide, dramatically loses value and is very hard to re-sell, as the limited channels through which collectible scrimshaw passes serves as a check on unscrupulous persons. As with any other fine art form, it is possible for experienced museums, auction houses or other experts to detect a fake.

Scrimshaw can also be practical tools that are hand carved by the scrimshander. They carved useful tools such as the jagging wheel. which is a multi-purpose tool used to pierce and trim a pie crust. Corset busks were carved from bone or ivory.

==Care and preservation==
Ivory is a fragile medium; many 19th-century pieces were preserved because they were kept in a barrel of oil on board ship. Gary Kiracofe, a scrimshander in Nantucket, Massachusetts, advises collectors that if a piece looks dry, one should fill the center of the tooth with unscented baby oil and allow it to remain until as much oil as possible is soaked into the microscopic pores of the ivory. Clear paste wax or high-end car wax will seal the surface after oiling. Bone items are even more fragile (more fibrous and porous) and may be treated the same way: with a light clear mineral oil. Organic oils are inadvisable, as they will eventually hasten discoloration, as on old piano keys subjected to the natural oils in one&#x27;s hands.

Professional conservators of art and historic artifacts generally recommend against applying any type of dressing (like oil or wax) to organic objects such as whale ivory. Sensible choices regarding storage and display preserve whale ivory best: keep out of direct sunlight, handle with cotton gloves or freshly washed hands, and avoid keeping in places with shifting humidity and temperature. Coating organic objects can induce eventual cracking.

==Design==
Whale teeth and bones were a highly variable medium, used to produce both practical pieces, such as hand tools, toys and kitchen utensils, and highly decorative pieces, which were purely ornamental. The designs on the pieces varied greatly as well, though they often had whaling scenes on them. For example, Herman Melville, in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, refers to &quot;lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies&#x27; busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other skrimshander articles&quot;. Most engravings were adapted from books and papers.

==Collections==
A significant amount of the original scrimshaw created by whalers is currently held by museums. Museums with significant collections include:
* The Hull Maritime Museum in Kingston upon Hull, England
* The Kendall Whaling Museum, which is part of the New Bedford Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts
* The Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, Connecticut
* The Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England
* The Museu de Scrimshaw at the in Horta on the island of Faial in the Azores
* The Nantucket Whaling Museum
* The Mariners&#x27; Museum in Newport News, Virginia

==Modern scrimshaw==

While scrimshaw artists rarely use whale bone anymore, it is still employed by a few. Common modern materials are micarta, ivory (elephant, fossil, walrus), hippo tusk, warthog ivory, buffalo horn, giraffe bone, mother of pearl, and camel bone. Modern scrimshaw typically retains the nautical themes of historical scrimshaw, but can also extend well beyond the traditional motifs.

Contemporary trade and carving techniques have led to more advanced, but fewer unique scrimshaw carvings. Collectors are advised to be aware of fakes.

<doc id="1136224" wikidata="Q3310911" url="?curid=1136224" title="Wolf, goat and cabbage problem">
<text>The wolf, goat, and cabbage problem is a river crossing puzzle. It dates back to at least the 9th century, and has entered the folklore of several cultures.

==The story==

A farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross a river by boat. The boat can carry only the farmer and a single item. If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage. How can they cross the river without anything being eaten?

==Solution==
The first step that must be taken is to let the goat go across the river, as any other actions will result in the goat or the cabbage being eaten. When the farmer returns to the original side, he has the choice of taking either the wolf or the cabbage across next. If he takes the wolf across, he would have to return to get the cabbage, resulting in the wolf eating the goat. If he takes the cabbage across second, he will need to return to get the wolf, resulting in the cabbage being eaten by the goat. The dilemma is solved by taking the wolf (or the cabbage) over &quot;and bringing the goat back&quot;. Now he can take the cabbage (or the wolf) over, and finally return to fetch the goat. 
His actions in the solution are summarized in the following steps:

# Take the goat over
# Return empty-handed
# Take the wolf or cabbage over
# Return with the goat
# Take whichever wasn&#x27;t taken in step 3 over
# Return empty-handed
# Take the goat over

There are seven crossings: four forward and three back.

The key to the solution is realizing that one can bring things back (emphasized above). This is often unclear from the wording of the story, but never forbidden. Knowing this will make the problem easy to solve even by small children. The focus of the puzzle is not just task scheduling, but creative thinking, similarly to the Nine dots puzzle.

==Occurrence and variations==
The puzzle is one of a number of river crossing puzzles, where the object is to move a set of items across a river subject to various restrictions.

In the earliest known occurrence of this problem, in the medieval manuscript &quot;Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes&quot;, the three objects are a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage, but other cosmetic variations of the puzzle also exist, such as: wolf, sheep, and cabbage;, p. 26 fox, chicken, and grain; fox, goose and corn; and panther, pig, and porridge. The logic of the puzzle, in which there are three objects, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;, such that neither &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; nor &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; can be left together, remains the same.

Another version of the puzzle stemming from a Chinese legend is recorded in an 18th-century painted panel by Japanese artist Maruyama Ōkyo, in the collection of the British museum. According to the legend, when a tiger has three cubs, one of them will be a leopard rather than a tiger, and more fierce than the others. Following this legend, the subject of a tiger with her cubs became a traditional subject for art in east Asia. The depiction by Ōkyo shows the tiger family crossing a river, with the mother carrying one cub across the river at a time. This depicts a puzzle equivalent to the puzzle of the wolf, goat, and cabbage, asking how the mother can do this without leaving the leopard cub alone with any of the other tiger cubs. The same variation of the puzzle has also been recorded as a koan of Ryōan-ji, a Zen temple in Kyoto.

The puzzle has been found in the folklore of African-Americans, Cameroon, the Cape Verde Islands, Denmark, Ethiopia, Ghana, Italy, Romania, Russia, Scotland, the Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe., pp. 26–27; It has been given the index number H506.3 in Stith Thompson&#x27;s motif index of folk literature, and is ATU 1579 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system.

The puzzle was a favorite of Lewis Carroll, and has been reprinted in various collections of recreational mathematics., p. 26.

In his &#x27;Arabian Nights&#x27; memoir, &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot;, the metaphysical Magus, G. I. Gurdjieff cites this riddle as &quot;The Wolf, the goat and the cabbage&quot;. He notes, &quot;This popular riddle clearly shows that...not solely by means of the ingenuity which every normal man should have, but that in addition he must not be lazy nor spare his strength, but must cross the river extra times for the attainment of his aim.&quot;

Variations of the puzzle also appear in the adventure game &quot;Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon&quot;, the Nintendo DS puzzle game &quot;Professor Layton and the Curious Village&quot;, and in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Gone Maggie Gone&quot;, where Homer has to get across a river with Maggie, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper, and a jar of rat poison that looks like candy. In the &quot;Class of 3000&quot; episode &quot;Westley Side Story&quot;, Sunny and his students perform a similar exercise involving a chicken, a coyote and a sack of corn. The &quot;Between the Lions&quot; episode &quot;Farmer Ken&#x27;s Puzzle&quot; portrays it being made into a computer game with a cat, a hen, and a sack of seeds. 

In the &quot;Bull&quot; episode &quot;Justice for Cable&quot;, Benny begins a riddle with &quot;a man has a fox, a duck, and a bag of beans&quot;. Bull inexplicably declares &quot;There is no answer&quot;, and everyone believes him.

In some parts of Africa, variations on the puzzle have been found in which the boat can carry two objects instead of only one. When the puzzle is weakened in this way it is possible to introduce the extra constraint that no two items, including &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, can be left together., p. 27.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; episode &quot;Time Amok&quot;, a holographic version of Kathryn Janeway employs the tale (here told as the chicken, fox and grain problem) to teach the crew of the USS &quot;Protostar&quot; how to work together.

<text>The Noon Gun has been a historic time signal in Cape Town, South Africa, since 1806. It consists of a pair of black powder Dutch naval guns, fired alternatingly with one serving as a backup. The guns are situated on Signal Hill, close to the centre of the city. The sight seeing point is officially permanently closed, and public entrance is unattainable.

A similar tradition exists in different other locations around the world, including in Nice (France), Hong Kong and at both Québec citadel and Halifax citadel (Canada).

== History ==
The settlement at the Cape of Good Hope was founded by the Dutch in 1652 and the signal guns were originally part of the regular artillery at the Imhoff Battery at the Castle in Cape Town.

The guns, which are still in use today, are 18 pounder smooth bore muzzle loading guns, and were designed by captain Thomas Blomfield in 1786. They were cast by Walker &amp; Co. in early 1794, and proof fired at Woolwich in June 1794. After this type of gun was adopted by the Royal Navy as their standard naval gun, the Noon Guns were brought to Cape Town during the 1795 occupation.

In 1795 during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain took the Cape Colony from the Dutch East India Company (&quot;(De) Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)&quot; in Dutch). The VOC transferred its territories and claims to the Batavian Republic in 1798 and ceased to exist in 1799. The British handed the Cape Colony back to the Batavian Republic in 1803. However, in 1806 the Cape was occupied again by the British after the Battle of Blaauwberg. Thereafter the British controlled the Cape continuously until it became a part of the independent Union of South Africa in 1910. Shortly after the English took over, the two Dutch guns were removed from the Imoff Battery and redeployed in town as signal guns, and the Castle received the latest English 18-pounders. Because the very loud report of the cannons upset residents nearby, the guns were eventually moved to the somewhat more remote Lion Battery on Signal Hill at . The first signal fired from there was on 4 August 1902.

Sailing ships were slow by modern standards and could not store fresh food for long periods, so the provisioning of vessels was one of the major commercial functions at Cape Town in those olden days. The noon Gun in Cape Town can be heard as far as the Parow area if listening closely; Indeed, the city was widely renowned as &quot;The Tavern of the Seas&quot;. There were no telephones or telegraphs before the latter half of the 19th century and the sound of the guns travelled much faster than a dispatch rider on a horse. The guns were therefore originally used to announce the arrival of a ship, perhaps requiring provisions for the next leg of its journey, to residents living in the interior. As more modern means of communications and transportation became available, Cape Town discontinued the use of the guns to announce that a ship was in port.

The original guns – 18-pounder, smoothbore muzzle-loaders – are still in use today. The ritual represents one of Cape Town&#x27;s oldest living traditions. These are the oldest guns in daily use in the world. They fire every day at 12 noon sharp, except Sundays and public holidays, and are maintained by the South African Navy.

==Time signalling==
In addition to the aforementioned port hailing duties, the guns have had the task of firing a time signal since 1806. According to local tradition, the initial purpose of the gun was to allow ships in port to check the accuracy of their marine chronometers (a precision instrument used aboard ships to help calculate longitude). The gun report might be too inaccurate for ships several kilometers away if they did not correctly compensate for the relatively slow speed of sound.
For this reason, ships marked their time by the puff of smoke rather than the sound, and this is one reason the guns are sited high above Cape Town Harbour.

The invention of the more accurate time ball in 1818 soon made time guns redundant for mariners wishing to set their chronometers. The time ball on Signal Hill was used to relay time from the Cape Town Observatory, whose time ball was not visible from all parts of the bay. At precisely 1:30pm Cape Mean Time, the ball would be dropped at the Observatory – an observer on Signal Hill would then drop that more prominent ball too. When setting their chronometers, mariners adjusted their observation of the time ball on Signal Hill by a second to allow for the relay from the observatory.

After the advent of the galvanic telegraph, it became possible to electrically trigger a gun remotely, and since 1864 the Noon Gun has been fired directly from the master clock of the oldest timekeeper in the country, the South African Astronomical Observatory. A South African Navy duty officer is present to ensure both guns are charged, explain the Noon Gun to any onlookers, and manually fire the backup gun in case of some failure with the active gun.

== Notable events ==

There have been few remarkable incidents involving the guns over the centuries. Perhaps the most notable one occurred many decades ago, in the days when horse-drawn traffic was commonplace. The rammer used to tamp the charge into the muzzle was inadvertently left in the bore of the cannon, and when the gun fired the rammer flew down into the city and killed a horse.

One day in June 1895, the gun fired at 10:30 rather than 12:00 when a spider interfered with the relay used to remotely fire the gun.

On Friday 7 January 2005, both the main gun and backup gun failed to fire owing to a technical difficulty. This was the first time in 200 years that the noon gun had not fired as scheduled.

On 9 April 2013, a Twitter account was created for the Noon Gun that sends a single message reading &quot;Boom!” every day (except Sundays and public holidays). Unfortunately, this account seems to no longer be actively posting – the last post being on 23 May 2023. 

On 4 December 2020 both the main and backup guns fired in quick succession.

On 23 May 2022, the gun fired exactly 5 minutes late at 12:05.

Again, on 30 May 2022, the gun fired late at 12:12.

On 12 March 2023, the gun fired early at 11:20 and at 11:22.

On 15 September 2023, the gun fired 3 minutes late at 12:03.

==Early life==
Maberly was born in Reigate, Surrey, England. She is the daughter of a lawyer and one of five children; her older sister Polly is also an actress. She has two older brothers, Thomas and Guy, and one younger brother, Jack. Maberly attended Dunottar School, Reigate, where she skipped ahead a year and left with A-levels in maths, chemistry, history, and music.

Maberly began swimming competitively at the age of 5, and she was a county champion swimmer up to the age of 16. At 7 years old, she completed the BT National Swimathon (as the youngest individual to complete the event at the time) to raise money for St Piers Lingfield (Now &quot;Young Epilepsy&quot;), a school to help children with epilepsy.

She represented her county in tennis from the age of 12, and from 2004–2010 she played for the Royal Parks tennis leagues in London.

Maberly started playing the piano at the age of 6, and at 14 travelled to Venice, Italy, with the Dunottar Chamber Ensemble to perform as the solo pianist in a performance of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto no. 23 (K488). She achieved grade 8 in both Piano and Cello in school and went on to study at London&#x27;s Trinity College of Music, graduating in 2004 with a joint honours degree in piano and cello performance. She also composes music and sings jazz, and has sung at London jazz venue &#x27;Pizza on the Park&#x27;.

Maberly&#x27;s breakthrough role came in 1993 when she starred as Mary Lennox in the feature film &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. Directed by Agnieszka Holland, the film achieved international acclaim and has gone on to become a family classic.

She took to the stage as Juliet in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, then as &#x27;Mathilde&#x27; in Christopher Hampton&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Total Eclipse&quot;&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in London, alongside Ben Whishaw and Matthew Macfadyen.

Since graduating, Maberly has appeared in the feature films &quot;Like Minds,&quot; with Eddie Redmayne and Toni Collette; &quot;Popcorn&quot;; &quot;Rites of Passage,&quot; with Christian Slater and Wes Bentley; &quot;Standing Up,&quot; with Val Kilmer and Rhada Mitchell; &quot;The Ghastly Love of Johnny X&quot;; and &quot;Boogeyman 3&quot;.

She has completed several radio works for BBC Radio 4, including &quot;The Dorabella Variation&quot;, &quot;A Certain Smile&quot;, and &quot;National Velvet&quot;. Maberly&#x27;s narration of the audiobook &quot;Catherine Called Birdy&quot;, written by Karen Cushman, received an Audie Award in 1995.

In 2007, Maberly teamed up with a London-area music producer to record several of her own songs for a new mini album. Maberly demonstrated her musical abilities by playing the piano in the 1995 BBC drama &quot;Mothertime&quot; and the cello in the 2004 short film &quot;The Audition&quot;. She also produced and directed a music video for Danish rock band Blooq a.k.a. Triggerbox.

<text>Simon John Elliott (born 10 June 1974) is a New Zealand football manager and former player who most recently served as head coach of USL Championship side Sacramento Republic FC. A defensive midfielder, he spent his professional career in the |A-League, the |MLS and the Premier League.

He played for several clubs in the New Zealand semi-professional Central Premier League in the 1990s, and attended Wellington College prior to moving to the United States. Elliott subsequently played college soccer at Stanford University, where he scored 13 goals and made 12 assists.

==Club career==
Elliott began his professional career with A-League (now USL First Division) team Boston Bulldogs in 1999, playing three games, before joining Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy in May 1999. He was voted Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2000 after scoring five goals and making five assists, and helped the club to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 2000, the U.S. Open Cup in 2001 and the MLS Cup in 2002. He made 122 appearances for Galaxy in five seasons, scoring ten goals. In 2001, Elliott trained for two months with Manchester United in England, but eventually returned to the United States.

Elliott was traded in January 2004 to the Columbus Crew in exchange for a first round pick in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft. He played every game in the 2005 season but was unable to help the Crew to the MLS Cup Playoffs as they finished bottom of the Eastern Conference.

Elliott caught the eye of Chris Coleman, manager of Premier League club Fulham, during a pre-season friendly game in July 2005 and joined Fulham in training after the end of the MLS season. He then joined Fulham in January 2006 on a free transfer and made 13 league and cup appearances during the remainder of the 2005–06 season.

<text>The 1955 Atlantic hurricane season was, at the time, the costliest season ever recorded, just ahead of the previous year. The hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1955, and ended on November 15, 1955. It was an extremely active season in terms of accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), but only slightly above average in terms of storm formation, with 13 recorded tropical cyclones.

The first reported system of the year, January&#x27;s Hurricane Alice, was later found to have formed on December 30, during the 1954 season. Alice caused relatively minor impact as it tracked through the Lesser Antilles and eastern Caribbean Sea. The first tropical cyclone to form in 1955, Tropical Storm Brenda, caused two deaths and minor damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in early August. The quick succession of Hurricanes Connie and Diane caused significant flooding in the Northeastern United States, with nearly $1 billion (1955 USD, $11.05 billion in 2022 USD) in losses and at least 232 fatalities. The next three storms, Hurricanes Edith and Flora, along with Tropical Storm Five, caused very minor or no impact. In early September, Hurricane Gladys caused severe localized flooding in Mexico, primarily in Mexico City. Additionally, an offshoot of Gladys inflicted minor impact in Texas.

Hurricane Hilda struck the Greater Antilles and then Mexico. It was attributed to at least 304 deaths and $120 million in losses. In mid-September, Hurricane Ione struck eastern North Carolina and contributed the flooding from Connie and Diane, resulting in seven fatalities and $88 million in damage. Later that month, Hurricane Janet, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane, lashed several countries adjacent to the Caribbean Sea, as well as Mexico and British Honduras. Janet resulted in $53.8 million in damage and at least 716 deaths. An unnamed tropical storm in the month of October did not impact land. Hurricane Katie, the final storm, caused minor damage in a sparsely populated area of Hispaniola, totaling to at least $200,000; 7 fatalities were also reported.

Collectively, the storms this year caused 1,601 deaths and $1.11 billion in losses, making it the costliest season at the time. Afterward, a thenrecord four storm names were retired.

== Season summary ==

On April 11, 1955, which was prior to the start of the season, Gordon Dunn was promoted to the chief meteorologist of the Miami Hurricane Warning Office. Dunn was replacing Grady Norton, who died from a stroke while forecasting Hurricane Hazel of the previous season. In early June, the Hurricane Hunters received new reconnaissance aircraft, which contained the latest radar and electronic equipment, at the time. Later that month, shortly before the start of the 1955 season, a bill was proposed in the United States Senate to provide funding for 55 new radar stations along the East Coast of the United States. After the United States House of Representatives passed a bill allotting $5 million, the Senate disputed about possibly increasing the funding two-fold to $10 million. Eventually, the radars were installed, starting in July 1955. After the devastating storms of the season, particularly Connie and Diane, a United States Government organization with the purpose of monitoring tropical cyclones was established in 1956 with $500,000 in funding; it later became the modern-day National Hurricane Center.

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1955. It was an above average season in which 13 tropical cyclones formed. In a typical season, about nine tropical storms develop, of which five strengthen to hurricane strength. All thirteen depressions attained tropical storm status, and eleven of these attained hurricane status. Six hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most likely because of a strong, ongoing La Niña. Hurricane Alice was named in January 1955 but was operationally analysed to have developed in late December 1954. Within the official hurricane season bounds, tropical cyclogenesis did not occur until July 31, with the development of Tropical Storm Brenda. However, during the month of August, four tropical cyclones formed – including Connie, Diane, Edith, and an unnamed tropical storm. Five additional tropical cyclones – Flora, Gladys, Hilda, Ione, and Janet – all developed in September. Tropical cyclogenesis briefly halted until an unnamed tropical storm formed on October 10. The final storm of the season, Katie, dissipated on October 19, almost a month before the official end of hurricane season on November 15. Eight hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 1,603 deaths and $1.1 billion in damage.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 158, which was well above the 1950-2000 average of 96.1. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding , which is tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm Brenda ===

The first tropical depression of the season formed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico early on July 31. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Brenda. During the next 24 hours, the storm strengthened and attained its peak intensity of early on August 1 before making landfall in New Orleans, Louisiana, at a slightly weaker intensity of . The storm steadily weakened inland and at 0600 UTC on August 2, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. About 24 hours later, Brenda dissipated while located over northeastern Texas.

Between Pensacola, Florida, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, rainfall totals were generally about ; flooding, if any, was insignificant. Tropical storm force winds were reported, peaking at at Shell Beach, Louisiana, on the south shore of Lake Borgne. At the same location, tides between above normal were measured. Four people were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after their tugboat sank in Lake Pontchartrain, while three others swam to shore. Additionally, two fatalities occurred in the vicinity of Mobile, Alabama.
=== Hurricane Connie ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression east of Cape Verde on August 3. After six hours, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Connie. By August 4, Connie began to rapidly strengthen, becoming the first major hurricane of the season later that day. Initially, it posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, although it passed about north. The outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching in Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. In Puerto Rico, Connie destroyed 60 homes and caused crop damage. After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie turned to the northwest, reaching peak winds of . The hurricane weakened while slowing and turning to the north, and struck North Carolina on August 12 as a Category 2 hurricane.

Connie produced strong winds, high tides, and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore, causing heavy crop damage and 27 deaths in the state of North Carolina. Connie made a second landfall in Virginia, and it progressed inland until dissipating on August 15 near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Connie is noted for being the only hurricane in recorded history to strike Michigan/the Great Lakes region as a tropical storm. Four people were killed in Washington, D.C. due to a traffic accident. In the Chesapeake Bay, Connie capsized a boat, killing 14 people and prompting a change in Coast Guard regulation. There were six deaths each in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and eleven deaths in New York, where record rainfall flooded homes and subways. At least 225,000 people lost power during the storm. Damage in the United States totaled around $86 million, although the rains from Connie was a prelude to flooding by Hurricane Diane. The remnants of Connie destroyed a few houses and boats in Ontario and killed three people in Ontario.
=== Hurricane Diane ===

A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 7. It slowly strengthened and became Tropical Storm Diane on August 9. After a Fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Connie, Diane curved northward or north-northeastward and quickly deepened. By early on August 8, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. Only several hours later, Diane peaked as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of . The storm resumed its west-northwestward motion on August 13. Colder air in the region caused Diane to weaken while approaching the East Coast of the United States. A recently installed radar in North Carolina noted an eye feature, albeit poorly defined. Early on August 17, Diane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm. The storm then moved in a parabolic motion across North Carolina and the Mid-Atlantic before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on August 19. Diane headed east-northeastward until becoming extratropical on August 20.

Despite landfall in North Carolina, impact in the state was minor, limited to moderate rainfall, abnormally high tides, and relatively strong winds. Further north, catastrophic flooding occurred in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and New England. Of the 287 stream gauges in the region, 129 reported record levels after the flooding from Tropical Storm Diane. Many streams reported discharge rates that were more than twice of the previous record. Most of the flooding occurred along small river basins that rapidly rose within hours to flood stage, largely occurring in populated areas; the region in which the floods occurred had about 30 million people, and 813 houses overall were destroyed. The floods severely damaged homes, highways, power lines, and railroads, and affected several summer camps. Overall utility damage was estimated at $79 million. Flooding in mountainous areas caused landslides and destroyed crop fields; agriculture losses was estimated at $7 million. Hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed, accounting for $82 million in damage. Overall, Diane caused $754.7 million in damage, of which $600 million was in New England. Overall, there were at least 184 deaths.
=== Hurricane Edith ===

An easterly tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on August 21 in the tropical Atlantic. Moving towards the west-northwest, the disturbance slowly intensified, reaching tropical storm strength at 1200 UTC on August 23 and as such was named &quot;Edith&quot; by the Weather Bureau. Afterwards, Edith began to curve towards the northwest as it gradually intensified, attaining hurricane strength on August 26, but weakened back to a tropical storm early the next day. The storm re-intensified as it northeastward and accelerated, re-attaining hurricane status early on August 29. Edith became a Category 2 hurricane on August 30 and soon peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of . The hurricane began to gradually weaken after it passed east of the island, before becoming extratropical on August 31. The extratropical cyclone would later make a clockwise loop before dissipating completely early on September 5. Although Edith remained at sea, it was suspected that the hurricane may have caused the loss of the pleasure yacht &quot;Connemara IV&quot;, after it separated from its moorings.
=== Unnamed August tropical storm ===

A weak disturbance was first observed near Grand Cayman on August 23. The disturbance moved northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico, where it became a tropical depression late on August 25. Early the next day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. The tropical storm marginally strengthened further, peaking with maximum sustained winds of by 0000 UTC on August 27. Nearing the Gulf Coast of the United States, the system curved towards the west. The storm maintained its intensity up until landfall in Louisiana near New Orleans about four hours later. Moving inland, it slowly weakened while crossing the Central United States, degenerating to tropical depression strength by August 28 and dissipating over east-central Texas several hours later.

Strong waves generated by the storm caused tides above average, slightly damaging coastal resorts. Weather offices advised small craft offshore to remain in port due to the strong waves. Rough seas battered the schooner &quot;Princess Friday&quot;, but the ship was able to ride out the storm. The storm produced squalls further inland, causing heavy rains. Very minor damage occurred as a result of this cyclone.
=== Hurricane Flora ===

A tropical wave moved along the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and passed through Cape Verde between August 30 and August 31. Although the Panair do Brasil headquarters in Recife, Brazil reported a closed circulation on August 30, Tropical Storm Flora did not develop until 0600 UTC on September 2, while located about of Cape Verde. The storm strengthened at a steady pace for the following 48 hours and reached hurricane status late on September 3. Flora headed on a parabolic track, initially moving west-northwestward and then northwesterly by September 4. It continued to intensify and by September 6, the storm curved northward. Around time, a minimum barometric pressure of was reported, along with a maximum sustained wind speed of . Flora weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane curving to the northeast late on September 8 and became extratropical at 0600 UTC on September 9, while located about midway between Flores Island in the Azores and Sable Island, Nova Scotia.
=== Hurricane Gladys ===

A tropical depression developed in the Bay of Campeche at 1800 UTC on September 3. About 24 hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Gladys. The storm quickly intensified and reached hurricane status on September 5, roughly 24 hours after developing. Around that time, Gladys peaked as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of . Later on September 5, an offshoot of Gladys with cyclonic turning formed in the northern Gulf of Mexico and struck Texas on September 6; it may have been a separate tropical cyclone. Initially, Gladys headed north-northwestward, but then re-curved south-southwestward while approaching the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Early on September 6, it made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, as a minimal hurricane. Gladys curved southward while just barely inland and weakened, dissipating near Tuxpan, Veracruz, late on September 6.

Gladys dropped up to in Tampico, Tamaulipas. The worst of the flooding from Gladys occurred in Mexico City. Roughly 5,000 residents were isolated and required rescue. Police estimated that 2,300 homes were inundated with of water. About 30,000 families were impacted by the storm. Two children drowned and five additional people were listed as missing. In Texas, the highest sustained wind speed was in the Corpus Christi–Port O&#x27;Connor area, with gusts between offshore. Precipitation peaked at in Flour Bluff, a neighborhood of Corpus Christi. Flooding in the area forced &quot;scores&quot; of people to evacuate their homes. Damage estimates reached $500,000.
=== Hurricane Ione ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression early on September 10, while located about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. After six hours, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ione. Eventually, it turned to the northwest. At 0000 UTC on September 15, Ione reached hurricane intensity, while situated north of the Leeward Islands. Ione continued to deep while moving northwest. The storm reached Category 4 intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of early on September 18. Around midday on the following day, it made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a Category 2 hurricane. Shortly after moving inland over eastern North Carolina, Ione weakened to a tropical storm. Late on September 19, Ione re-emerged into the Atlantic near Norfolk, Virginia. The storm quickly re-strengthened early on September 20, but transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 21.

Strong winds, heavy rainfall, and abnormally high tides lashed some areas along the East Coast of the United States, especially North Carolina. In Cherry Point, sustained winds reached , with gusts up to . Overall, damage was slightly more than $88 million, mostly to crops and agriculture. Rainfall in the state peaked at in Maysville. Storm surge in North Carolina peaked at in Wrightsville Beach. As a result, several coastal roadways were flooded, including a portion of Highway 94 and Route 264. Seven deaths were reported in North Carolina. The remnants of Ione brought gusty winds to Atlantic Canada, which broken poles, uprooted trees, interrupted telephone service, damaged chimneys and caused power outages, especially in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador.
=== Hurricane Hilda ===
A tropical wave spawned Tropical Storm Hilda north of Puerto Rico early on September 12. Hilda quickly intensified while moving westward into a small hurricane by September 13. Although the storm passed just north of Hispaniola on that day, damage is unknown, if any. Later on September 13, Hilda made landfall near the southeastern tip of Cuba on September 13. There, it dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds that destroyed 80% of the coffee crop in Oriente Province. In the eastern Cuban city of Baracoa, Hilda severely damaged the oldest church in the country. Damage totaled $2 million in Cuba, and there were four deaths.

Although Hilda weakened to a tropical storm over southeastern Cuba, the system re-strengthened into a hurricane as it struck Grand Cayman early on September 15. The storm intensified further over the northeastern Caribbean, becoming a Category 3 major hurricane and reaching sustained winds of about 24 hours later. Late on September 16, Hilda struck a sparsely-populated region of the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, causing light damage. Although Hilda quickly weakened to a tropical storm over the Yucatán Peninsula, the cyclone re-strengthened to again reach winds of early on September 19. Before the hurricane moved ashore, there was residual flooding in Tampico from earlier Hurricane Gladys. Hilda struck the city early on September 19 and then rapidly weakened inland, dissipating on September 20. The storm is estimated to have generated gusts up to and dropped heavy rainfall that flooded 90% of Tampico, while its strong winds damaged half of the homes, leaving 15,000 homeless. Throughout Mexico, 11,432 people were directly affected by Hilda. Overall, the storm killed 300 people and caused over $120 million in damages. Additionally, the outer bands of Hilda caused minor flooding in southern Texas, particularly in Raymondville.
=== Hurricane Janet ===
Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21. Moving toward the west across the Caribbean Sea, Janet fluctuated in intensity, but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of . The intense hurricane made landfall at that intensity near Chetumal, Mexico on September 28. Janet&#x27;s landfall as a Category 5 hurricane on the Yucatán Peninsula marked the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic basin made on a continental mainland, with all previous storms making landfall as Category 5 hurricanes on islands. After weakening to a Category 2 over the Yucatán Peninsula, it moved into the Bay of Campeche and remained mostly unchanged in intensity before making its final landfall near Veracruz on September 29. Janet quickly weakened over Mexico&#x27;s mountainous terrain before dissipating on September 30.

In its developmental stages near the Lesser Antilles, Janet caused significant damage to the island chain, resulting in 189 deaths and $7.8 million in damages in the Grenadines and Barbados. While Janet was in the central Caribbean Sea, a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost, with all eleven crew members believed perished. This was the only such loss which has occurred in association with an Atlantic hurricane. A Category 5 upon landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet caused severe devastation in areas on Quintana Roo and British Honduras. Only five buildings in Chetumal, Mexico remained intact after the storm. An estimated 500 deaths occurred in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. At Janet&#x27;s second landfall near Veracruz, significant river flooding ensued, worsening effects caused by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the month. The floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326 people in the Tampico area. The flood damage would lead to the largest Mexican relief operation ever executed by the United States. At least 1,023 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8 million in damages.
=== Unnamed September tropical storm ===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 18 and continued west-northwestward. It is possible that the system developed into a tropical depression the next day, although lack of data prevented such classification until September 23, when a nearby ship reported winds of . An approaching cold front turned the system to the north on September 24. The structure gradually became better organized, and after turning to the northeast on September 26, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. This was based on a ship report of winds, which was also estimated as the system&#x27;s peak intensity. On September 27, the system became extratropical and accelerated its forward motion, dissipating within a larger extratropical storm south of Iceland on the next day.
=== Unnamed October tropical storm ===

A tropical wave was reported to have passed through Cape Verde on October 4. The system slowly developed a vertex as it curved in a generally northward direction. By early on October 10, two ships reported that a tropical depression formed almost halfway between the Azores and the Leeward Islands. After six hours, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. While re-curving to the northeast, the storm attained its maximum sustained winds of ; the lowest atmospheric pressure recorded in relation to the storm was , but the time of measurement is unknown. Although no significant weakening occurred, it eventually merged with an extratropical cyclone on October 14, while still well southwest of the Azores. During its extratropical stage, a ship in the area reported an atmospheric pressure as low as .
=== Hurricane Katie ===

A disturbance in the ITCZ developed into a tropical depression north of Panama on October 14. Early on the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Katie. The system moved generally northeast due to the presence of a strong low pressure area along the East Coast of the United States. Later that day, Hurricane Hunters observed a rapidly intensifying hurricane, encountering winds of and a pressure of several hours before the peak intensity. Early on October 17, Katie made landfall in extreme eastern Sud-Est, Haiti, as a strong Category 2 hurricane (although it may have been stronger). About half of homes in the town of Anse-à-Pitres were destroyed. Across the border in Pedernales, Dominican Republic, 68 houses were damaged. Overall losses were at least $200,000 and 7 fatalities were reported.

While crossing the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, Katie became very disorganized and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm early on October 17, within a few hours after moving inland. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean just east of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Katie began accelerating to the northeast on October 18. During that time, the storm re-intensified and briefly approached hurricane intensity, although it failed to strengthen further due to interaction with a cold front. After passing just east of Bermuda on October 19, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Katie were last observed the following day.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names were used for tropical cyclones that reached at least tropical storm intensity in the North Atlantic in 1955. This was a completely new set of names, thus every name used this season was used for the first time.


=== Retirement ===

After the season, the names &quot;Connie&quot;, &quot;Diane&quot;, &quot;Ione&quot;, and &quot;Janet&quot; were retired from future use within the North Atlantic basin because of their severity. As of , the 1955 season is one of four seasons to have four storm names retired, along with: 1995, 2004, and 2017; only the 2005 season has had morewith five names retired.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1955 USD.

<text>TrueMajority was a left-wing advocacy group in the United States. In September 2007, TrueMajority and its related organization TrueMajorityACTION merged with USAction. By 2008, the combined groups had over 700,000 members, making it, together with MoveOn, one of the two largest liberal advocacy groups in the United States.

TrueMajorityACTION was a separate but closely related organization, which had a different status under U.S. law so that it could campaign for specific parties and politicians.

In 2007, TrueMajority merged with USAction in 2007. In 2012, Ben Cohen founded Stamp Stampede.

== History ==
TrueMajority was founded in June 2002 by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s.

TrueMajority was mentioned on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on March 5, 2007, when Ben and Jerry made a guest appearance. In the episode, they offered free frisbees to Colbert viewers who visited the web site, and then they signed up each viewer who visited as a member of the advocacy group.

TrueMajority&#x27;s Ten Principles were endorsed by Greenpeace USA, Rock the Vote, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Peace Action, the National Head Start Association, Global Exchange, The Interfaith Alliance, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Sojourners&quot;, Rainforest Action Network, Women&#x27;s Action for New Directions, Service Employees International Union, and National Council of La Raza.

== Stances ==
TrueMajority organized protests of the 2008 G-20 Summit. It also opposed the 2008 financial bailout of banks, and helped to organize protests of the bailout.

In 2004 TrueMajority ran advertisements calling for a paper trail in electronic voting.

=== Iraq war opposition ===
TrueMajority co-sponsored protests and advertisements against the Iraq war in 2003. The organization published anti-war advertisements in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, but its ads were refused by television networks including CNN, Fox, MTV, and Comedy Central. TrueMajority also supported Howard Dean in the 2004 Democratic primary, mounting a letter-writing campaign and arguing for his support on the grounds of his opposition to the Iraq War. In 2008 TrueMajority gathered over 20,000 petitions to urge CalPERS to investigate KBR for war profiteering, including in the petitions accusations of rape and murder.

<text>Norman William &quot;Norm&quot; Sterling (born February 19, 1942) is a Canadian politician, who served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1977 to 2011.

==Background==
Sterling attended Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, and worked as a lawyer and engineer before entering public life. He was a partner in the Sterling &amp; Young law firm, and in 1974 became president of the Manotick Home &amp; School Association.

==Politics==

===Davis government===
Sterling ran unsuccessfully for a Progressive Conservative nomination in 1971, at age 29. He tried again, successfully, in 1977, and was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1977 provincial election in the safe eastern Ontario riding of Grenville—Carleton. He became parliamentary assistant to the Attorney General in 1978, but was not appointed to the cabinet of Bill Davis in his first term as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP).

Sterling was returned without difficulty in the 1981 election, and served as a minister without portfolio from April 10, 1981 to February 13, 1982. He was appointed as Provincial Secretary for Justice on February 13, 1982. On July 6, 1983, he was named as Provincial Secretary for Resource Development. Sterling, who represents a predominantly rural and Protestant region of Ontario, disagreed with the Davis government&#x27;s decision to fully fund Ontario&#x27;s Catholic school system and insisted that his protest be entered into the official minutes of the executive council. Sterling initially supported Dennis Timbrell to replace Davis as party leader, but crossed to Frank Miller on the last ballot after Timbrell was eliminated.



===In opposition===
The Progressive Conservatives lost power following the 1985 election, although Sterling had no difficulty being re-elected in his own riding. There was another Progressive Conservative leadership convention in late 1985. On this occasion, Sterling broke with Timbrell (describing the latter&#x27;s post-election opposition to Catholic school funding as an opportunistic volte-face), and supported Larry Grossman.

In the Liberal landslide of 1987, however, he was only able to defeat Liberal candidate Roly Armitage by about 500 votes in the redistributed riding of Carleton.

Sterling was re-elected in the provincial elections of 1990. During his first stint in opposition, Sterling held numerous shadow cabinet portfolios such as critic for: the Solicitor General of Ontario; the Management Board of Cabinet; Economics, Industry, Trade and Technology; Intergovernmental Affairs; and Treasury and Economics and Revenue.

===Harris government===
In the 1995 election he was re-elected by almost 20,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives formed government under Mike Harris in 1995, and Sterling was appointed Minister of Small Business and Consumer Services on June 26 of that year. On August 16, 1996, he was promoted to Minister of Environment and Energy. On October 7, 1997, he became Government House Leader and was given the re-titled post of Minister of the Environment. As Minister of the Environment, Sterling oversaw cuts of nearly 50% to the ministry&#x27;s budget and privatized provincial water testing labs, which an inquiry found contributed to the Walkerton E. coli outbreak the year after he left the portfolio. During the public inquiry, Sterling testified he had not read the province&#x27;s drinking water rules and that drinking water was not a major priority for the Harris government. He also took responsibility for failing to read a warning from the health minister about shortfalls in the water-testing system.

In the provincial election of 1999, Sterling was returned for the restructured riding of Lanark-Carleton. He was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Government House Leader on June 17, 1999. Following a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, he became Minister of Consumer and Business Services; he also served as Minister of Correctional Services from December 5, 2000 to March 8, 2001.



===Eves government===
On April 15, 2002, after Ernie Eves replaced Mike Harris as Premier, Sterling was appointed Minister of Transportation. After a cabinet shuffle on February 25, 2003, he was promoted to the position of Attorney General, with responsibility for Native Affairs.


===In opposition (2nd time)===
The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election, although Sterling was able to defeat Liberal Marianne Wilkinson by about 6,000 votes.

In the 2004 leadership race, Sterling supported Jim Flaherty&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party.

In 2004, Sterling opposed parts of the legislation to create the GTA-area Greenbelt that did not allow easily removing protected status from designated land, and voted against the bill in 2005.

Lanark-Carleton was redistributed prior to the 2007 provincial election, and Sterling ran for re-election in the newly created riding of Carleton-Mississippi Mills, which had been created out of the eastern two-thirds of his old riding. He won by a convincing margin, defeating Liberal Megan Cornell by over 7,000 votes.

In the 2009 leadership race, Sterling supported the successful candidacy of Tim Hudak. However, the membership of his riding association supported rural-rights candidate Randy Hillier; Carleton-Mississippi Mills was one of only three ridings in the province where Hillier won a first-ballot victory.

In March 2011, Sterling was defeated in the race for his riding’s PC nomination for the 2011 Ontario general election by Jack MacLaren, the former president of the Ontario Landowners Association, and left politics upon his term running out.

Sterling held multiple shadow cabinet portfolios during his second stint in opposition, such as critic for Democratic Renewal, critic for Health Promotion, critic for Intergovernmental Affairs, and Finance critic. He also served as the chair of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts during this period.

== After politics ==
In April 2021, Sterling was appointed by Premier Doug Ford as chair of the Greenbelt Council, replacing David Crombie, who resigned along with six other council members in December 2020 over Ford&#x27;s intention to reduce the power of conservation authorities. Sterling will be in charge of Ford&#x27;s plan to expand the Greenbelt, which was announced after public blowback from Crombie&#x27;s resignation.

<text>Duo Datz (Hebrew: אורנה ומשה דץ, &quot;Orna U-Moshe Datz&quot;; commonly referred in Hebrew as דץ ודצה &quot;Datz Ve-Datza&quot;) is a group comprising Orna and Moshe Datz (colloquially known as Datz and Datza or as the Datzes). A musical duo in Israel for audiences of all ages, they were also introduced to European audiences by scoring a third place for Israel at the 1991 Eurovision Song Contest. 

The Datzes duo were together from 1985 to 2006. During that period, Duo Datz released ten albums, some of which reached gold album status, and six videotapes for preschoolers. The best known five of the six are in the Tif vaTaf series. The other recording is &quot;I want a party for me with Datz and Datza&quot; (1995). It was based on birthday songs by Smadar Shir, from her book &quot;I want a party for me&quot;.

== History ==
===1980s: Marriage, In the Same Bed, The Ways of Love===
Orna Cohen and Moshe Datz met during a joint concert tour around the world as part of the traveling band of the Hasidic Singer Festival, which performed in front of Jewish communities around the world. The two got married and began to act and perform together with great success. Their popularity increased after the 1987 Eurovision Kdam national selection, where they sang the song &quot;Cupidon&quot; which placed fourth.

In the summer of 1987, they published their first album &quot;In the same bed&quot;, which included the songs of Moshe Mitzvot &quot;Hoofim&quot; [2]. Its theme song was written by Hani Livna (also from &quot;Beaches&quot;) and composed by . Other prominent songs on the album were &quot;Shir Kavein&quot; and &quot;Shir Lemenach&quot;. Despite the success of the songs, the album was not a commercial success and was not praised by the critics. The album&#x27;s songs were arranged by Ron Droyan.

The duo released their second album &quot;The Ways of Love&quot; in 1989. Chava Alberstein was the artistic consultant and musical producer on this album, with Rami Levin doing the arrangement. The album was awarded gold certification. The hits of the album were &quot;Mi&quot;, which was written and composed by Elberstein, &quot;In the ways of love&quot;, &quot;Each time again&quot;, &quot;Lan&quot; and &quot;Why did you come&quot;. It was later released on CD. Other composers on the album, in addition to Alberstein, were Uzi Hitman, Rachel Shapira, and . In the same year, the children&#x27;s and youth series &quot;Tzatzkani&quot;, whose theme song was performed by the two, was broadcast on television.

=== 1990–1994: The Glass Bell, Aris, Kan at the Eurovision ===
In their second Kdam attempt, in 1991, the duo won with the song &quot;Kan&quot; and were sent to represent Israel at Eurovision 1991 in Rome, where their song placed third overall, only seven points away from first place. The song was originally offered to Yardena Arazi for her Eurovision participation in 1988. Arazi had turned it down. 

In January 1992, a small plane they were flying in with the Swedish singer Carola made a crash landing at the Bar Yehuda Airfield near the Dead Sea.

=== 1995–1999: The Sixth, The First Man, albums for children ===
In 1997, they participated in an advertising campaign for the Israeli Israel Dairy Board, and a year later in an advertising campaign for the diaper brand &quot;Tapanoks&quot;

In January 1999, the duo released their sixth album &quot;Orena and Moshe Datz&quot;, also known as &quot;The First Man&quot;. In this successful album, the songs &quot;I sing to you&quot;, &quot;Eat her&quot; with Lior Farhi , a new version of &quot;Hida at Li&quot;, a new version of &quot;Derech yusha&quot; with the Eden band and the duet with Daklon for his song &quot;Vanmati Shir&quot; (&quot;Ayelet Chen&quot;) stood out. The album&#x27;s songs were arranged by Dodi Rosenthal and Gadi Goldman.

For Hanukkah 1999, the duo played in the musical &quot;Cinderella and the prince&quot;. In the same year, they also led the advertising campaign of the insurance company &quot;The Most Direct&quot;.

=== 21st century: Collections, Tif vaTaf, separation, unifications ===

On 22 December 2006 the couple announced they were ending their 21-year marriage. Since, the couple has collaborated on several occasions.

<doc id="1136256" wikidata="Q705408" url="?curid=1136256" title="Joe DeRita">
<text>Joseph Wardell (July 12, 1909 – July 3, 1993), known professionally as Joe DeRita, was an American actor and comedian, who is best known for his stint as a member of The Three Stooges in the persona of Curly Joe DeRita.

==Early life==
DeRita was born into a show-business family in Philadelphia, the son of Florenz (&quot;née&quot; DeRita) and Frank Wardell, and of French-Canadian and English ancestry. He was the youngest of 5 brothers. Wardell&#x27;s father was a stage technician, his mother a professional stage dancer, and the three often acted on stage together from his early childhood. Taking his mother&#x27;s maiden name, DeRita, the actor joined the burlesque circuit during the 1920s, gaining fame as a comedian. During World War II, DeRita joined the USO, performing throughout Britain, France, and the Pacific with such celebrities as Bing Crosby and Randolph Scott. In the 1944 comedy film &quot;The Doughgirls&quot;, about the housing shortage in wartime Washington, D.C., he had an uncredited role as &quot;the Stranger&quot;, a bewildered man who repeatedly showed up in scenes looking for a place to sleep.

==Career==
=== Joe DeRita short subjects ===
In 1946, DeRita was hired by Columbia Pictures Short Subjects Division head/director Jules White to star in his own series of comedies. The first effort, &quot;Slappily Married&quot;, was released under the studio&#x27;s All-Star Comedy series. The three remaining entries—&quot;The Good Bad Egg&quot;, &quot;Wedlock Deadlock&quot; (both 1947) and &quot;Jitter Bughouse&quot; (1948)—billed DeRita as the headliner. Regarding his Columbia shorts series, DeRita said, &quot;My comedy in those scripts was limited to getting hit on the head with something, then going over to my screen wife to say, &#x27;Honey, don&#x27;t leave me!&#x27; For this kind of comedy material, you could have gotten a busboy to do it and it would have been just as funny.&quot; After his contract with Columbia ended, DeRita returned to burlesque and recorded a risque LP in 1950 called &quot;Burlesque Uncensored&quot;.

=== Larry, Moe and Curly Joe ===
When Shemp Howard died of a heart attack on November 22, 1955, the Three Stooges were still making short comedies for Columbia Pictures. Shemp was succeeded by Joe Besser in 1956; both Shemp Howard and Joe Besser had starred in their own separate short subjects. Columbia eventually shut down the short-subjects department at the end of 1957, and Besser quit the act in 1958 to take care of his ailing wife. The two remaining Stooges seriously considered retirement. But Larry saw DeRita in a Las Vegas stage engagement and told Moe that DeRita would be &quot;perfect for the third Stooge.&quot; Howard and Fine invited DeRita to join the act, and he readily accepted. At first, they had difficulty drawing an audience. But Columbia began releasing their shorts to television through their Screen Gems subsidiary, and their popularity with children put them back on top.

It was rumored that Jules White had attempted to recruit DeRita for the Three Stooges in 1955 because he wanted &quot;another Curly&quot;, but that strong-willed DeRita had refused to change his act or imitate another performer, and White eventually gave up on him. DeRita himself debunked the rumor, saying that it &quot;added a romance to the story&quot;. When he first joined the act, shortly after appearing in a dramatic role in the Gregory Peck Western, &quot;The Bravados&quot;, DeRita wore his hair in a style similar to that of former Stooge Shemp Howard and did so during initial live stage performances. However, with the restored popularity of the Three Stooges shorts on TV featuring Curly Howard, it was suggested that Joe shave his head in order to look more like Curly. At first, DeRita sported a crew cut; this eventually became a fully shaven head. Because of his physical resemblance to both Curly and Joe Besser, and to avoid confusion with his predecessors, DeRita was renamed &quot;Curly Joe&quot;.

=== Theatrical feature films ===
The team embarked on a new series of six feature-length theatrical Three Stooges films, including &quot;Have Rocket, Will Travel&quot; (1959), DeRita&#x27;s on-screen debut with the Stooges, and &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot; (1961). These recycled routines and songs from the older films. Moe and Larry&#x27;s advanced age, as well as pressure from children&#x27;s advocacy groups, resulted in milder forms of their trademark slapstick. While DeRita&#x27;s physical appearance was vaguely reminiscent of Curly, his characterization was different.

=== Gradual decline ===
DeRita remained a member of the team through the 1960s, participating in a full workload of television appearances and commercials, a multiyear movie contract, and &quot;The New Three Stooges&quot; animated cartoons series, which included live-action introductions. In January 1970 Larry Fine had a stroke during the production of &quot;Kook&#x27;s Tour&quot;, a pilot for a planned TV series, which put all new Stooges-related material on hold. Emil Sitka was twice named as &quot;the middle stooge&quot;, but never got to perform with the team. Shortly after Larry&#x27;s stroke, Moe, Emil, and Joe were going to appear in a movie written by Moe&#x27;s grandson, but financing fell through. Before Moe&#x27;s death on May 4, 1975, the Stooges, with Sitka, had planned to film a movie called &quot;The Jet Set&quot;. This was later produced with the surviving members of the Ritz Brothers and released as &quot;Blazing Stewardesses&quot;.

In the early 1970s, with Moe&#x27;s approval, DeRita attempted to form a &quot;new&quot; Three Stooges. He recruited burlesque and vaudeville veterans Mousie Garner and Frank Mitchell to replace Moe and Larry for nightclub engagements. Their act was poorly received, thereby ending the group.

On August 30, 1983, the Three Stooges received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Joe Besser was the only Stooge to show up at the ceremony because of DeRita&#x27;s illness; Stooges longtime supporting player Emil Sitka spoke for him. Besser later fell ill and died from heart failure on March 1, 1988, at age 80.

==Personal life==
DeRita was married twice. His first marriage was to a chorus girl named Bonnie Brooks, born Esther M. Hartenstine. They were married from July 13, 1935, until her death on September 6, 1965; they had no children. DeRita married his second wife, Jean Sullivan, the following year on December 28.

DeRita was the only member of the Stooges who was not Jewish.

==Death==
DeRita died of pneumonia on July 3, 1993, nine days before his 84th birthday. He was residing at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, at the time of his death. He was the last surviving member of the Stooges. DeRita is interred in a grave at the Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California. His tombstone reads &quot;The Last Stooge&quot;.

==Legacy==

Although DeRita enjoyed working with Moe and Larry and made a living doing it, he was not a fan of the Stooges&#x27; humor. He once told an interviewer:

On April 24, 2000, ABC aired a television movie about the Stooges, with actor Peter Callan playing DeRita.

<text>Arnold Maurice Jacobs (June 11, 1915 – October 7, 1998) was an American tubist who spent most of his career with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He held that position from 1944 until his retirement in 1988.

Jacobs was considered one of the foremost brass pedagogues of his time as well as an expert on breathing as it related to brasswind, woodwind, and vocal performance. Due to childhood illness and adult onset asthma, his lung capacity was significantly impaired. He is best remembered for his playing philosophy which he referred to as &quot;Song and Wind.&quot;

==Life and performing career==
Jacobs was born in Philadelphia on June 11, 1915, but was raised in California. Jacobs&#x27; family enjoyed music and he credited his mother, a keyboard artist, for his initial interest in music. He spent his youth progressing from bugle to trumpet to trombone and finally to tuba. When he was fifteen years old, he entered Philadelphia&#x27;s Curtis Institute of Music on a scholarship and continued to major in tuba.

After his graduation from Curtis in 1936, he played two seasons in the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra under Fabien Sevitzky. From 1939 until 1944, he was the tubist of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner. In 1941, Jacobs toured the country with Leopold Stokowski and the All-American Youth Orchestra. He was a member of the Chicago Symphony from 1944 until his retirement in 1988. 

During his forty-four year tenure with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO), he took temporary leave in the spring of 1949 to tour England and Scotland with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He was on the faculty of Western State College&#x27;s Music Camp at Gunnison, Colorado, during the early 1960s. In June 1962, he had the honor of being the first tuba player invited to play at the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico. Mr. Jacobs and with colleagues from the CSO were part of the famous 1968 recording of Gabrieli&#x27;s music with members of the Philadelphia and Cleveland Orchestras. He was also a founding member of the Chicago Symphony Brass Quintet, appeared as a soloist with the CSO on several occasions, and recorded the Vaughan Williams &quot;Concerto for Bass Tuba and Orchestra&quot; with Daniel Barenboim conducting the Chicago Symphony. In recognition of his outstanding career, in 2001, the Chicago Symphony&#x27;s tuba chair was dedicated as the Arnold Jacobs Principal Tuba Chair, Endowed by Christine Querfeld. Jacobs was succeeded in the CSO by Gene Pokorny.

==Teaching==
Jacobs had the reputation as both the master performer and master teacher. He taught tuba at Northwestern University. He also taught lessons on all wind instruments in his private studio. He was one of the most sought-after teachers in the world, specializing in respiratory and motivational applications for brass and woodwind instruments and voice. His students include many in orchestras and university faculties around the world.
Jacobs gave lectures and clinics throughout the world. During the CSO&#x27;s 1977 and 1985 Japanese tours, Jacobs presented clinics in Tokyo. In January 1978, he lectured at Chicago&#x27;s Michael Reese Hospital about playing wind instruments for the therapeutic treatment of asthma in children. He presented masterclasses at Northwestern University a week each summer from 1980 to 1998. The Second International Brass Congress presented its highest award to him in 1984. In 1991, he presented a clinic for the United States Marine Band in Washington D.C. He gave masterclasses as part of the Hearst Scholar program at the University of Northern Iowa and the Housewright Chair at Florida State University.

The Midwest Clinic presented Jacobs their highest award, the Medal of Honor, in 1985. In 1994, The Chicago Federation of Musicians awarded him for Lifetime Achievement at the first Living Art of Music awards. During his eightieth birthday celebration in 1995, he presented a lecture to the International Brassfest at Indiana University and the International Tuba-Euphonium Conference at Northwestern University. Northwestern&#x27;s School of Music presented him the first Legends of Teaching award. Mayor Richard M. Daley proclaimed June 25, 1995, as Arnold Jacobs Day in the City of Chicago.

Jacobs was given an honorary Doctor of Music degrees from the VanderCook College of Music in 1986 and DePaul University in June 1995.

==Legacy==
Several books written by students about Jacobs are available, &quot;Arnold Jacobs, The Legacy of a Master&quot; edited by M. Dee Stewart, &quot;Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind&quot; by Brian Frederiksen, &quot;Teaching Brass&quot; by Kristian Steenstrup, &quot;Lasting Change for Trumpeters: The Pedagogical Approach of Arnold Jacobs&quot;&#x27; and &#x27;Brass Singers: The Teaching of Arnold Jacobs&#x27; by Dr. Luis E. Loubriel, and &quot;Also Sprach Arnold Jacobs&quot; compiled by Bruce Nelson. Two compact discs, &quot;Arnold Jacobs Portrait of an Artist&quot; and &quot;Arnold Jacobs Legacy of an Artist&quot;, were compiled by Frank Byrne as audio &quot;time capsules&quot; of his voice and playing.

<doc id="1136268" wikidata="Q3488866" url="?curid=1136268" title="Elaan of Troyius">
<text>&quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot; is the thirteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written and directed by John Meredyth Lucas, it was first broadcast on December 20, 1968.

In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; ferries a spoiled princess whose betrothal, it is hoped, will bring peace to a star system at war.

&quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot; was written and directed by John Meredyth Lucas, the first person in &quot;Star Trek&quot; production history ever to both write and direct a filmed &quot;Star Trek&quot; television episode. Terry Matalas became the second with the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; episode &quot;The Last Generation&quot; in 2023.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the planet Elas to pick up Elaan, the Dohlman of Elas. Accompanying them is Ambassador Petri of Troyius, a planet with which Elas has been at war. As Petri explains, the Elasian Council of Nobles and the Troyius Tribunal have agreed to marry Elaan to the Troyian king to secure peace, lest the two planets destroy each other. Elaan is a most reluctant bride, cursing an arrangement that she considers a humiliation. Ambassador Petri&#x27;s mission is to instruct — er, &quot;to acquaint&quot; — Elaan in the manners and customs of the Troyians.

Not long after the &quot;Enterprise&quot; begins the return journey to Troyius at low impulse speed, a Klingon warship is detected, which paces the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and ignores all hails. To complicate matters further, Elaan stabs Petri, who refuses to have any further dealings with the Dohlman and vows that his ruler will never marry her. The job of teaching her falls to Captain Kirk.

In Sickbay, Nurse Chapel asks the ambassador why Elasian women are so prized in spite of their savagery. Petri explains that when the tears of an Elasian female touch a man&#x27;s skin, his heart is &quot;enslaved forever&quot;.

Elaan does not take kindly to Kirk&#x27;s efforts to educate her and attempts to stab him. He overpowers her, disarms her, and insists that she will learn what she has been ordered to learn. Elaan locks herself in a bathroom and begins to cry, saying she is tired of being hated by everyone. Kirk tries to comfort her, and after wiping a tear from her cheek finds himself besotted with Elaan. They begin a passionate affair that quickly turns into a love affair.

Meanwhile, one of the ship&#x27;s engineers is killed by Kryton, Elaan&#x27;s chief bodyguard, who then tampers with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s warp engines and tries to contact the Klingon battle cruiser. He is captured, but commits suicide before he can be interrogated. Kirk orders Chief Engineer Scott to check the ship&#x27;s propulsion systems. Elaan reveals that Kryton was in love with her and had been infuriated by the news of the arranged marriage.

The Klingon battlecruiser then begins what appears to be an attack. As Kirk orders the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to go to warp, Scott reports that, as a result of Kryton&#x27;s sabotage, any attempt to do so will destroy the ship. As the Klingon passes by without firing, it becomes clear that they were hoping to destroy the &quot;Enterprise&quot; without an overt act of war. This plan having failed, the Klingons attack in earnest. Mr. Scott reports that Kryton damaged the dilithium crystals in the antimatter reactor control system, making it impossible to go to warp or fire their weapons.

In Sickbay, Ambassador Petri again approaches Elaan and begs her to accept the necklace of Troyian royal jewels that was to be worn at her wedding, as a symbol of the hope for peace between their two worlds. Elaan accepts the necklace and subsequently appears on the bridge wearing it with her wedding dress. Spock detects strange energy readings from some of the jewels, which Elaan describes as common stones, valued only as good-luck charms. The stones are in fact dilithium crystals, which explains the Klingons&#x27; keen interest in this star system.

The crystals are taken to Scott in Engineering, where he and Spock work to replace the damaged dilithium crystals as the battlecruiser moves in for the kill. Power is restored to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; just before the Klingons’ final attack. After suffering serious damage from the &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; photon torpedoes, the Klingon ship is successfully driven off.

A much changed Elaan is delivered safely to Troyius. Before she departs, Elaan gives Kirk her dagger as a memento, explaining she has learned that &quot;on Troyius, they do not wear such things.&quot; She and Kirk say their farewells in the transporter room, with a heartbroken Elaan crying as she is beamed down. Later, McCoy appears on the bridge to report he has found an antidote to the Elasian tears, but it seems not to be needed after all. As Mr. Spock points out, &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did.&quot;

==Production and reception==
Cut from the episode was a scene in the ship&#x27;s recreation room, where Kirk, McCoy, Uhura and Spock meet and discuss how to calm Elaan. Uhura suggests using the sound of Spock&#x27;s Vulcan harp to calm her; the music is later heard piped into Elaan&#x27;s cabin.

This episode features the first appearance of the D-7 class Klingon battle cruiser designed and built by &quot;Star Trek&quot; art director Walter M. Jefferies. The footage of the Klingon battle cruiser was re-used in subsequent episodes of the third season.

France Nuyen had previously starred with William Shatner on Broadway for two years in the title role of &quot;The World of Suzie Wong.&quot; She would later guest-star along with Shatner, as husband and wife, in the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; season 3 episode &quot;A Small Beheading&quot;.

This is the last episode lit by cinematographer Gerald Finnerman, who had been with the show since the first episode.

This episode is also the final appearance in the original series (as originally broadcast) of Eddie Paskey as Lt. Leslie.

The episode&#x27;s title character pays tribute to Helen of Troy from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, and its plot borrows from William Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

&quot;Trek Navigator&quot; Mark A. Altman gave the episode two stars stating &quot;A thinly veiled version of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, the episode is largely carried on the shoulders of William Shatner.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Zack Handlen rates &quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot; as a B, making note of character development and the unexpected ending: &quot;If you&#x27;d asked me to predict the rest of the episode after Elaan and Kirk hooked up, I would&#x27;ve guessed it would have something to do with Kirk interfering with the wedding ... [i]nstead, we get a nifty space battle against the Klingons, a traitor in the Elasians, an unexpected source of dilithium crystals, and a curiously muted performance from Shatner that does a good job at conveying his internal struggle between feeling and duty without overselling it.&quot;

Samuel Walters of [dauntlessmedia.net] rates the episode as a C−, citing a &quot;scattershot approach to the plot&quot; which &quot;leaves too many possibilities unexplored and underdeveloped,&quot; and calling the entire episode &quot;flat.&quot;

== Critical Response and Analysis ==
Popular and scholarly viewers alike express uncertainty if this episode was written with a feminist ethos in mind — mocking the perceived stereotypes of women at the time — or if the episode is just another portrayal of colonial and patriarchal depictions of women. The superficial depiction of Elaan as an exoticized, seductive, and stereotypically uncooperative feminine character has garnered scholarly discussions over whether Elaan is a pro-feminist or anti-feminist character within the history of Star Trek – a series known for its progressive characterizations (first primetime interracial kiss on TV, gay actors).

Star Trek reviewer Jamahl Epsicokhan responds to the episode with a lukewarm assessment, asserting, &quot;The problem (or, more specifically, the running gag)—Elaan is a terrible-mannered woman from a society short on manners. She must be taught in the ways of etiquette. Her teacher (after she stabs the first one) is James T. Kirk, naturally. Watchable, mostly brainless, middle-of-the-road fare, &quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot; is at its best when it shows Kirk balancing the approaches of diplomacy and forceful wording when dealing with the brat that Elaan is.&quot; Epsicokhan identifies Elaan as the antagonist of the story - a plot device that Kirk needs to overcome.

Other scholars frame Elaan through a feminist lens. Jarrah Hodge, host of podcast Women of Warp, asserts that Elaan is “othered,” exoticized, and objectified: &quot;This technique showing women’s body parts separately, before or instead of showing her face, is a classic example of objectification. This type of “dismemberment” depiction (as part of a larger culture) encourages men and women to see women as a collection of parts, rather than of a whole.&quot; She cites Daniel Leonard Bernardi in &quot;Star Trek and History: Race-ing Toward a White Future,&quot; who claims that &quot;“&quot;Elaan exemplifies two stereotypes about Asian women, starting off as a manipulative ‘dragon lady’ and ending as the ‘submissive female slave’”.

Media Critic and historian L.I. Underhill writes that that even though Shatner and Nuyen are convincingly in love, the script has &quot;racist and sexist imagery about manipulative and savage foreign women&quot;. Underhill focuses on Asian female stereotypes and colonialist themes: ‘Elaan of Troyius’ brings into play stereotypes of the Asian female – the manipulative dragon lady and the submissive female slave. Elaan is both irrational and primitive; she throws temper tantrums, eats with her hands, and drinks from the bottle. Kirk tells her, ‘Nobody’s told you that you’re an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman’s body, an arrogant monster.’ Captain Kirk, the ‘white knight’ of Star Trek, articulates his and the Federation’s moral superiority and authority over the Asian-alien and her people through sexual conquest.

Scholar Lori Ann Stephens explains the complexity of Elaan’s character and her place as a protagonist that inspires admiration in Kirk by the end of the episode: “As the episode unfolds, we learn that in spite of her beauty, her stubbornness, and her magical tears, nothing can grant Elaan complete agency or self-determination. It is her fierce struggle against this fate that makes her such an extraordinary and admirable character.” () Elaan has to forsake all of her desires and autonomy in order to ensure interplanetary peace through an arranged marriage, a reflection of the experiences of real women in diplomatic history: &quot;One might conclude that she has no other choice, just as hundreds of women have been treated as tools to facilitate exchanges of land, titles, financial security, and peace treaties.&quot;

== Releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;.

<text>In toss juggling, Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge is a 3-ball juggling pattern named by George Gillson after its inventor, Rick Rubenstein. Along with Mills&#x27; Mess and Burke&#x27;s Barrage, it is one of three well-known named juggling patterns that involve complex carries and crossed arm throws. Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge is usually considered the most involved and difficult of the three.

==Description==
Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge is a shape distortion of the three-ball Siteswap 52233. A shape distortion means that the throws are done from non-standard positions, in this case, using crossed arm movements. The varying heights can be represented in Siteswap notation by the numbers 52233. In this notation, each of the numbers represents one particular throw in a sequence of five throws. 
* The 5 is thrown under the arm as in a windmill or Mills Mess. 
* The hand that threw the 5 will now be crossed under the other arm, which now uncrosses, which is a held 2. 
* The first arm now crosses over the second arm while holding its ball, this is the second 2. 
* The next toss is a 3, which is thrown under the arm by the second hand on the side opposite to where the 5 was thrown. 
* The final toss is a 3, which is an uncrossing reverse cascade throw. 

This is one round of Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge.

In addition to the varying ball heights, Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge incorporates elements of chops, claws and orbits. While the ball thrown as a 5 is in midair, the two other balls are carried in circular orbits around each other. These balls are then thrown and caught with the palm of the hand turned at an odd angle as in claws. One of these balls is caught with a downward diagonal movement as in chops.

The overall pattern results in a fluid and natural spiraling motion of the hands and balls. The trick is difficult to understand, especially from a written description.

<doc id="1136271" wikidata="Q370791" url="?curid=1136271" title="Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria">
<text>Arnulf II (birth unknown; died 14 July 937), also known as the Bad (), the Evil (&quot;der Böse&quot;) or the Wicked, a member of the Luitpolding dynasty, held the title of Duke of Bavaria from about 907 until his death in 937. He is numbered in succession to Arnulf of Carinthia, counted as Arnulf I.

==Life==
The year of Arnulf&#x27;s birth is unknown, but it is said that he was the namesake of other Arnulfs born around the time of the reign of the seventh-century bishop Arnulf of Metz and the Carolingian king Arnulf of Carinthia. Arnulf was the son of Margrave Luitpold of Bavaria and Cunigunde, herself a member of the Ahalolfing dynasty, daughter of Berthold I, the count palatine of Swabia. Her brother Erchanger assumed the Swabian ducal title in 915.

Under the weak rule of the East Frankish king Louis the Child, Margrave Luitpold had already achieved a strong position in the Bavarian lands, succeeding the Wilhelminer margraves. He ruled over extended estates along the Danube with Regensburg (Ratisbon), and in the adjacent Nordgau.

===Duke of Bavaria===
Together with numerous Bavarian nobles, Arnulf&#x27;s father was killed in the 907 Battle of Pressburg (Bratislava), when the Bavarian &quot;Heerbann&quot; under his command suffered a crushing defeat in a campaign against the Hungarian forces of Grand Prince Árpád. After the death of his father, Arnulf succeeded him in his Bavarian lands, and soon after he assumed the title of a &quot;Duke of Bavaria&quot; as ruler of the estates around Regensburg. An energetic and combative man, he received broad support from the local nobles, however, already during his ascension in to dukedom, he was faced with constant raids from the Hungarians. These attacks had laid waste the East Frankish lands of Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia.

Besieged by frequent Hungarian raids and desperate to raise funds to finance a re-organized defense, Arnulf strengthened his power through confiscation of church lands and the secularization of numerous monastery estates, which earned him the nickname &quot;the Bad&quot; by medieval chroniclers. In several skirmishes he was able to force back the Hungarian invaders and he defeated a small force in 913 with the support by his Swabian relatives. Having re-established the stem duchy of Bavaria, he eventually negotiated a truce with the Hungarian princes, who thereafter largely passed through Bavaria on their raids into other German duchies.

===Imperial politics===
Duke Arnulf pursued a policy of independence from the East Frankish kings. Though in 911 he participated in the election of King Conrad I of Germany in 911; in Conrad&#x27;s conflict with Erchanger of Swabia he backed his Swabian uncle and later challenged Conrad&#x27;s Saxon successor, King Henry the Fowler. The dispute was only temporarily settled when in 913 Arnulf&#x27;s widow mother Cunigunda married King Conrad.

In 916 Conrad&#x27;s forces invaded Bavaria, attacking and pillaging Regensburg. These attacks drove Arnulf into exile with his former enemies in Hungary. In September, the king convoked a church council in Hohenaltheim, attended by the Bavarian episcopate, which summoned Arnulf and his younger brother Berthold on the grounds of excommunication at Regensburg on 1 November. It is more than likely that Arnulf and his family never appeared at the convocation, or that the council meeting was never held. As a result, they remained exiled among the Hungarians. In January 917, King Conrad, angered at the situation, called for the execution of his rebellious Swabian brother-in-law, Erchanger and his brother Berthold, giving Arnulf more pause for concern.

In 919, the death of Conrad I allowed Arnulf to return to Bavaria and expel the king&#x27;s forces. Conrad I being childless, the throne was open to Arnulf, again. On his return, according to the &quot;Annales iuvavenses&quot;, in 920, &quot;Baiuarii sponte se reddiderunt Arnolfo duci et regnare ei fecerunt in regno teutonicorum&quot; (&quot;the Bavarians freely submitted themselves to Duke Arnulf and asked him to reign within the realm of the Germans&quot;). The 919 ascension of Henry the Fowler would bring forth a battle for the throne; however, whether the Bavarians, with some other East Franks, actually elected Arnulf anti-king in opposition to Henry has not been conclusively established.

In any case, Arnulf&#x27;s &quot;reign&quot; was short-lived; King Henry I turned out to be a strong opponent and defeated him in two campaigns in 921. When Arnulf was besieged by Henry in Regensburg, the duke entered into peace negotiations and recognized the sovereignty of the German king. King Henry confirmed Arnulf&#x27;s autonomous rule over Bavaria, including the right of investiture and several important regalia, in return for Arnulf&#x27;s renunciation of his royal claim.

===Later years===

Arnulf accompanied King Henry I on his 928 campaign against Duke Wenceslaus of Bohemia. In 935 he launched an attack against King Hugh of Provence to obtain the Iron Crown of Lombardy for his eldest son Eberhard, which only resulted in defeat. After King Henry had died in 936, the Duke attended the coronation of his son Otto as King of the Romans at Aachen Cathedral.

Duke Arnulf died in his Regensburg residence on 14 July 937; he was succeeded by his son Eberhard, who nevertheless was deposed by King Otto in 938. Arnulf is buried at St. Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey. A commemorative plaque in tribute to him was attached to the Walhalla memorial in 1842.

==Marriage and children==
Historians believed Arnulf was married to Judith of Friuli, a member of the Unruoching dynasty, daughter of Count Eberhard of Friuli (d. 866). The dates, however, do not match up. Judith of Friuli died ca. 881. This would have made a marriage between a boy (or at least young) Arnulf and an elder Judith, who was supposed to have produced several children 23 years or so after her death. More likely, therefore, is that he was married to Judith of Sülichgau (born ca. 888), daughter of Margrave Eberhard&#x27;s grandson Count Eberhard of Sülichgau (d. after 889) and Gisela of Verona.

They had the following children:
*Eberhard (–), Duke of Bavaria from 937 to 938
*Arnulf II (–954), Count palatine of Bavaria from 938
*Herman (d. 954)
*Henry
*Louis (born , died after 974)
*Judith (died after 984), married the Ottonian duke Henry I of Bavaria, brother of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor.
*Berthold I markgraf of Nordgau (maybe identical to Berthold of Schweinfurt count of Schweinfurt, margrave of Nordgau), founder of the Branch of Schweinfurt.
*Adelheid married with Burkhard Margrave of marchia orientalis (later Austria)

<doc id="1136279" wikidata="Q808399" url="?curid=1136279" title="Barn dance">
<text>A barn dance is any kind of dance involving traditional or folk music with traditional dancing, occasionally held in a barn, but, these days, much more likely to be in any suitable building. 

The term “barn dance” is usually associated with family-oriented or community-oriented events, usually for people who do not normally dance. The caller will, therefore, generally use easy dances so that everyone can join in.

A barn dance can be a ceilidh, with traditional Irish or Scottish dancing, and people unfamiliar with either format often confuse the two terms. However, a barn dance can also feature square dancing, contra dancing, English country dance, dancing to country and western music, or any other kind of dancing, often with a live band and a caller. Modern western square dance is often confused with barn dancing in Britain.

Barn dances, as social dances, were popular in Ireland until the 1950s, and were typically danced to tunes with rhythms.

==Radio adaptations==

WLS in Chicago is credited with developing the “barn dance” radio format, which was in large part responsible for the advent of country music in the United States. The National Barn Dance began as a program of old-time fiddling on April 19, 1924, with George D. Hay as the show&#x27;s host and announcer. A year-and-a-half later, Hay moved to Nashville, Tennessee and brought in an old-time fiddler to launch the &quot;WSM Barn Dance&quot;; this show is now known as the Grand Ole Opry and remains on the air to this day. Dozens of similar programs cropped up on AM radio stations all across the United States, from New England to Los Angeles, including the WWVA Jamboree in Wheeling, West Virginia (1933), the Renfro Valley Barn Dance in Kentucky (1939), the Louisiana Hayride (1948), the Tennessee Jamboree (1953) and Ozark Jubilee (1954). Television adaptations (often under the guise of early variety shows) were popular in the 1950s and early 1960s but eventually faded out of style.

<doc id="1136281" wikidata="Q1737450" url="?curid=1136281" title="Kayleigh">
<text>&quot;Kayleigh&quot; is a song by British neo-prog band Marillion. It was released as the first single from the concept album &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;. It is the band&#x27;s most successful single in the UK, where it peaked at number two and stayed on the UK singles chart for 14 weeks. It also became the band&#x27;s most successful single worldwide, reaching the top 10 in Ireland, Norway, and West Germany. In the United States, it gave the band their sole appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, reaching number 74 in October 1985.

The song popularised the name Kayleigh in the UK. It was later performed by the band&#x27;s lead singer, Fish, at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at Wembley Stadium, with Midge Ure on guitar and Phil Collins on drums.

==Composition==
&quot;Kayleigh&quot; has been characterised as a &quot;tremulous torch song&quot;. Fish, the band&#x27;s lead singer and lyricist, said that writing the lyrics was &quot;his way of apologizing to some of the women he had dated in the past.&quot; Although he had at one point dated a woman whose forenames were Kay Lee, the song was more a composite of several women with whom he had had relationships. Fish told &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2014, &quot;I&#x27;d wanted to write a song about a girlfriend I&#x27;d split up with, whose name was Kay. Which of course we couldn&#x27;t do. So we added her middle name, Lee, and it became Kayleigh instead.&quot;

Fish was quoted:
I was very confused at the time, you know, I had a lot of long term relationships, a lot of &#x27;deep and meaningful&#x27; relationships that basically I&#x27;d wrecked because I was obsessed with the career and where I wanted to go. I was very, very selfish and I just wanted to be the famous singer but I was starting to become aware of the sacrifices that I was making, and I think that Kay was one of those sacrifices that went along the road. &#x27;Kayleigh&#x27; was not just about one person; it was about three or four different people. The &#x27;stilettos in the snow&#x27;, that was something that happened in Galashiels, when I can remember going down one night and we were both really drunk, and, you know, dancin&#x27; under a street light, and &#x27;dawn escapes from moon-washed college halls&#x27; was part of the Cambridge thing.

According to Steve Rothery, the guitar hook line through the verse came from demonstrating to his girlfriend what effects a chorus and a delay pedal could add to a guitar&#x27;s sound. Rothery recorded the song on a chorused Stratocaster guitar, using the pick and his second and third fingers to play it. The album version contained an extended guitar solo by Rothery, 27 seconds of which is edited for the single version.

On 24 October 2012, Marillion announced on Facebook that &quot;Sad news via Fish – Kay – who inspired our song Kayleigh – has sadly died. RIP Kay.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Kayleigh&quot; entered the UK singles chart on 18 May 1985 and climbed to the number two position. It was kept from number one by a version of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; by the charity supergroup the Crowd in June 1985, which was released following the Bradford City stadium fire.

As with all Marillion albums and singles of the Fish period, the cover art was designed by Mark Wilkinson from an idea by Fish. The B-side on the international version, &quot;Lady Nina&quot;, would go on to be used as a single promoting the 1986 US-only mini album &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;. &quot;Lady Nina&quot; is the only Marillion song from the Fish era to use a drum machine. The US version of the single uses &quot;Heart of Lothian&quot; instead, another track from &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; that would eventually be released as the third and final single from the album. A CD replica of the single was also part of a collectors box-set released in July 2000 which contained Marillion&#x27;s first 12 singles and was re-issued as a 3-CD set in 2009 (see &quot;The Singles &#x27;82–&#x27;88&quot;).

==Music video==
The promotional video for the single was shot in West Berlin, where the &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; album was recorded. Tamara Nowy, a German woman who subsequently married lead singer Fish, and Robert Mead, the boy portrayed on the sleeve of the album and the single, appeared in the video.

==Legacy==
The song&#x27;s popularity in mid-1985 was responsible for a significant rise in popularity of the name Kayleigh. Its popularity and legacy was addressed by Harry Wallop, writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2011:
Some names just didn&#x27;t exist a generation ago, but have taken off in popularity. The most famous of these is Kayleigh, which came into existence thanks to the neo-prog rock band Marillion, who had a number two hit with a single of this name in 1985. It was almost unheard of before the song. But since then it has taken hold, especially with parents who grew up with a love of long-haired bouffant power ballads. A few years ago, the name made it to the 30th most popular girl&#x27;s name in Britain, and it remains popular: 267 children were named it last year. Curiously, though, it has spawned a bewildering sub-sect of names, nearly all of which are unrelentingly bizarre. There were 101 Demi-Leighs last year, seven Chelsea-Leighs and four called Lilleigh, which sounds like a sanitary product.

In 2012, it was announced that the Scottish Borders Council was to inscribe extracts from the song&#x27;s lyrics into the pavement at the newly developed Market Square in Galashiels. Council engineer David Johnstone said the authority felt it was appropriate to mark the links between Galashiels and the song: 
The lyrics from the song Kayleigh included reference to the old textiles college. Some of the lyrics referred to &#x27;dawn escapes from moon-washed college halls&#x27; and &#x27;do you remember cherry blossom in the market square?&#x27; There was a feeling that these lyrics were really appropriate and because of the connection between the singer and Galashiels that it would be appropriate to engrave some of those lyrics into the paving and make more of a feature of it.&quot; Johnstone also said the original cherry trees referred to in the song had been removed due to disease but they would be replaced.&quot;

In 2013, in a presentation on crowd funding for a TED conference in Bedford, Marillion keyboardist Mark Kelly identified the song&#x27;s popularity as &quot;part of the reason I&#x27;ve never had a proper job and I&#x27;ve been able to make a living from music for the past 32 years&quot;.

In a 2021 interview about &quot;Weltschmerz&quot;, which Fish described as his final album, he said that &quot;I&#x27;m never going to be playing stadiums or arenas again. And I definitely don&#x27;t want to be on the chicken-in-a-basket circuit singing fucking &#x27;Kayleigh&#x27;.&quot;

<text>The 1957 Atlantic hurricane season featured one of the longest-travelling tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin, Hurricane Carrie. Nevertheless, the season was generally inactive, with eight tropical storms – two of which went unnamed – and three hurricanes, two of which intensified further to attain major hurricane intensity. The season officially began on June 15 and ended on November 15, though the year&#x27;s first tropical cyclone developed prior to the start of the season on June 8. The final storm dissipated on October 27, well before the official end of the season. The strongest hurricane of the year was Carrie, which reached the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on two separate occasions in the open Atlantic; Carrie later caused the sinking of the German ship &quot;Pamir&quot; southwest of the Azores, resulting in 80 deaths.

In total, the season resulted in at least 513 fatalities and $152.5 million in damages. Hurricane Audrey was the season&#x27;s most destructive and deadly storm, causing 416 deaths and about $150 million in damages. Audrey made landfall just east of Sabine Pass, Texas, in the U.S. state of Louisiana as a strong Category 3 hurricane in late June. Three other tropical storms in the year made landfalls along the Gulf Coast of the United States, bringing heavy rains that resulted in widespread flooding across much of the Southeastern United States. The highest rainfall total measured associated with a tropical cyclone was in Quarantine, Louisiana, during Tropical Storm Esther. However, an unofficial reading of was measured in an unknown location in the Florida Panhandle during Tropical Storm One. The year&#x27;s other tropical systems curved out to sea without causing much impact. After the season, the name Audrey was retired.

== Season summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1957. It was a below-average season in which eight tropical cyclones formed, of which three became hurricanes. Of these hurricanes, two became major hurricanes. In an average season, ten tropical cyclones form, of which five become hurricanes. Five of the season&#x27;s eight tropical cyclones developed in the Gulf of Mexico, the most since the 1936 season, in which six formed in the gulf. The first tropical storm of the season formed on June 8, a week before the official start of the hurricane season. However, the first named storm, Audrey, formed afterwards, on June 25; these two storms were the only to form in June during the season. July featured no Atlantic tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Bertha was the only system to form during August, developing in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Atlantic, no storms formed during the month, below the climatological average of one. The low monthly activity was in part due to an unfavorable wind pattern which prevailed across the Atlantic for much of the month. In September, however, conditions for tropical cyclogenesis were more favorable, with concomitant cyclonic activity. Four storms formed, of which two attained hurricane strength, higher than the mean activity of the last 70 Septembers. By contrast, only one tropical storm formed in October, below the average of two in the month. This tropical storm dissipated on October 27, 16 days before the official end of the hurricane season on November 15.

Five tropical cyclones made landfall during the hurricane season, including one hurricane. All of these storms made landfall on the Gulf Coast of the United States. Property damage that resulted from cyclone-related impacts totaled to $152 million in the United States, with most caused by Hurricane Audrey, which made landfall near the border between Texas and Louisiana. 513 deaths were also caused by tropical storms during the season, with 416 deaths attributable to Hurricane Audrey.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflective with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 84, which is categorized as being &quot;near normal.&quot; However, this was under the 1950–2000 average of 96.1. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of hurricanes multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical cyclones with winds exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Unnamed June tropical storm ===
An area of disturbed weather accompanied by low barometric pressure was first identified near the Yucatán Peninsula on June 7. Reports from the following day in the region reported pressures that were indicative of a developing tropical cyclone, and at 06:00 UTC, the disturbance attained tropical storm strength, the first of the season. Though hurricane reconnaissance flights could not locate a well-defined center, ship observations showed that the tropical storm was moving quickly to the northeast. Due to its fast forward motion, the storm gained little in organization and made landfall near Port Leon, Florida, on June 9 with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). However, the system gradually strengthened as it crossed the Florida peninsula, reentering the North Atlantic later that day. On June 10, the storm reached peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) prior to becoming an extratropical storm. The post-tropical cyclone then strengthened and moved erratically in open seas before entirely dissipating on June 15.

Despite the tropical storm&#x27;s fast passage over land, heavy rainfall was reported, officially peaking at in Live Oak, Florida. However, unofficial reports of at least of rain were collected. In Perry, Florida, 100–200 families were evacuated due to the floodwater. Field crops, including tobacco and watermelon, were damaged, with flood damage estimated at $30,000. The storm also spawned ten tornadoes, with nine in northeastern Florida and one on Georgia&#x27;s Jekyll Island. All of these tornadoes were relatively weak and caused minor damage, totaling to $12,000. At the coast, the tropical storm&#x27;s strong winds generated waves high, which caused moderate damage. Though located south of where the storm made landfall, buildings and roads along the Tampa Bay Area waterfront were flooded by the waves. The cabin cruiser &quot;Kinnebar&quot; capsized in the Gulf of Mexico due to the waves, and five of the seven crew on board drowned; these were the only deaths associated with the system. Coastal damages due to storm surge amounted to $10,000, and overall the storm caused $52,000 in damages across the southeastern United States.

=== Hurricane Audrey ===

An ill-defined tropical wave was first identified in the Caribbean Sea on June 20, and moved westward into the Bay of Campeche. The disturbance slowly strengthened as it developed a low pressure system. A nearby trough aided the intensification of the system, and it developed into a tropical depression on June 24, while remaining generally stationary in the Bay of Campeche. Situated in an area of favorable upper-air divergence and warm waters, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Audrey about six hours later. Audrey began to accelerate northward due to troughing in the upper-levels in the atmosphere. The storm became a hurricane late on September 25. Audrey intensified quicker while in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, reaching peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of on June 27. Audrey made landfall at this intensity in extreme southwestern Louisiana very shortly thereafter. The hurricane quickly weakened as it moved inland, becoming an extratropical cyclone by June 28. The extratropical remnants soon dissipated over the Northeastern United States.

Hurricane Audrey caused widespread impacts across a wide swath of the United States and Canada. The storm&#x27;s worst effects were felt in Louisiana, where the storm caused $120 million in damages. The highest storm surge measured with the hurricane was , reported west of Cameron, Louisiana. The strong surge inundated much of the coast, killing much of the local wildlife and causing widespread property damage. Heavy rainfall also caused flooding, peaking at west of Basile, Louisiana. Rainfall was concentrated particularly in the Atchafalaya Basin. In Texas, effects of the storm were much less severe, but the storm still caused $8 million in damages, primarily as a result of strong winds. Further inland, the weakening hurricane spawned tornadoes and caused additional flooding in conjunction with a frontal boundary. The effects of Audrey were felt as far north as Canada, where 15 people died due to the strong winds and heavy rain. In total, the storm caused $152 million in damages and at least 416 deaths.

=== Tropical Storm Bertha ===
A weak extratropical low entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 6 and drifted slowly westward. The system slowly organized, developing into a tropical depression on August 8 about southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Moving westward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bertha later on August 8. Bertha then turned northwestward and quickly organized; the system attained its peak intensity with and an estimated minimum pressure of 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47 inHg) on August 9. Early on August 10, Bertha came ashore near Cameron, Louisiana. at the same intensity. After landfall, the storm moved northward due to a strong high-pressure system and weakened over land, before degenerating into a remnant low at 0600 UTC on August 11 over Oklahoma. The storm&#x27;s remnants later moved across the U.S. Interior Highlands before dissipating.

In the Gulf of Mexico, 1,350 workers on offshore oil drilling platforms were evacuated in preparation for the storm. The oil drilling tender &quot;Murmanill No. 1&quot; sunk due to the strong waves, though the two people on board at the time were evacuated by helicopter. At the coast, the maximum storm surge height measured was at the Schooner Bayou Control Structure. Bertha dropped heavy rainfall primarily as a remnant low across much of The Ozarks. Rainfall peaked at near Damascus, Arkansas, which set a 24-hour rainfall record for the city and made August 1957 the wettest month on record. Across Arkansas, the heavy rains triggered flash floods after numerous rivers exceeded flood stage. The flash floods caused property damage in cities adjacent to rivers. Though damage estimates were difficult to accurately obtain, four Arkansas counties reported combined losses of $925,000, and two deaths were reported.
=== Hurricane Carrie ===

An easterly tropical wave spawned a tropical depression near the Cabo Verde Islands on September 2. The depression moved generally west-northwestward and became Tropical Storm Carrie on September 3, before becoming a hurricane on September 5. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on early September 8 as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northward and fluctuated in intensity, bottoming out at Category 1 intensity early on September 10. After turning northward on September 11, the storm began re-strengthening, reaching a secondary peak as a Category 3 hurricane on September 13. However, the storm soon began slowly weakening, falling to Category 2 intensity shortly before curving west-northwestward on September 14. Although Carrie threatened Bermuda, the storm passed northeast of the island and then turned in a general eastward direction by September 17. Carrie accelerated northeastward by September 22 and passed through the Azores over of close to Terceira Island as a Category 1 hurricane. The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 23, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles. The extratropical system dissipated near the southwestern tip of England on September 25.

Due to its distance away from any major land masses, Carrie caused relatively minor damage along its path. On September 16, the hurricane passed well north of Bermuda, causing minimal damage despite its intensity at the time, though hurricane reconnaissance flights in the area were postponed due to damage sustained by one of the aircraft. As it was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone southwest of the Azores, the German ship Pamir encountered the storm and capsized on September 21, resulting in the deaths of 80 crew members on board. On September 23, Carrie completed its extratropical transition. As an extratropical storm, Carrie brought strong storm surge and heavy rain to the British Isles, which claimed three lives. The hurricane&#x27;s long duration and path in open water also helped it attain a number of Atlantic hurricane records.
=== Tropical Storm Debbie ===
On September 5, a weak easterly wave moved into the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean Sea due to the influence of an upper-level trough. The wave organized and spawned a weak area of circulation which developed into a tropical storm by 0600 UTC on September 7. Moving steadily towards the northeast at roughly , Debbie only marginally strengthened due to the presence of cooler air entrainment. Late on September 8, Debbie made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida as a minimal tropical storm with winds of . A minimum barometric pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg) was recorded in Pensacola, Florida. The tropical storm weakened as it moved over land, degenerating to a tropical depression on September 9. The system became increasingly diffuse, and later merged with strong weather systems by 0600 UTC later that day.

Offshore, the tropical storm generated high tides above average in Apalachee Bay, located about east of where Debbie made landfall. The strong surf caused some localized flooding. In St. Marks, Florida, a station recorded maximum sustained winds of , the highest measured in association with the storm. However, a station in Tampa, Florida recorded a peak wind gust of in a squall. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, though rainfall was mostly beneficial to crops. Rainfall peaked at in Wewahitchka, Florida, while precipitation was reported as far north as Pennsylvania. The tropical storm only caused minor damage, but was indirectly responsible for four deaths.
=== Tropical Storm Esther ===
On September 12, a mid-level circulation area formed over Nicaragua and slowly drifted northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. As it entered the Gulf, the system developed thunderstorm activity and an area of low pressure, and as a result the Weather Bureau began initiating advisories on a newly formed tropical depression on September 16. The depression quickly intensified and attained tropical storm strength. Esther continued to strengthened, reaching a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg) early on September 18, as reported by a hurricane reconnaissance flight. Shortly thereafter, the large tropical storm peaked with sustained winds of as it made landfall to the southwest of Dulac, Louisiana. Esther weakened over land and later dissipated over the Mississippi Valley by 1200 UTC on September 19.

Like Tropical Storm Debbie, which had made landfall just a week prior in the same area, Esther&#x27;s wind impacts were minimal. The strongest gust measured associated with the storm was , as recorded at Pensacola International Airport. Other locations reported similar gusts and strong winds in squalls. Heavy rains persisted in the region well after Esther moved inland, resulting in high rainfall amounts. Rainfall peaked at in Quarantine, Louisiana, near the mouth of the Mississippi River. The heavy rains breached several levees, resulting in severe flooding, particularly in Buras, Louisiana. Although rainfall was beneficial in many places due to an existing drought, cotton, pecan, and peanut crops were damaged by the floods. While crop damage amounted to $1 million, property damage amounted to $1.5 million. Esther also caused three indirect deaths, all of which were in Louisiana.
=== Hurricane Frieda ===
On September 20, a low pressure area developed within the same frontal boundary that had curved Hurricane Carrie towards the Azores. Rapidly developing, the system was classified as a tropical depression at 1200 UTC later that day, southwest of Bermuda. Initially, the depression was ill-defined and was slowly moving to the southwest. The following day, the attached cold front dissipated, allowing for the system to intensify. The system was subsequently upgraded a tropical storm by September 22, following a reconnaissance flight into the system which reported a minimum pressure of 1001 mbar (hPa; 29.56 inHg). At the time, however, Frieda was a small system with minimal shower activity. Gradually strengthening, Frieda reached an initial peak intensity with winds of later that day. Following the split of an upper-level ridge to the north, Frieda recurved towards the northeast the next day. As it sped to the northeast, a westerly shortwave progressed eastward, enhancing environmental conditions. As a result, the tropical storm began to quickly strengthen. By 1200 UTC on September 25, Frieda attained hurricane strength, and reached peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of 992 mbar (hPa; 29.30 inHg), as reported by the Canadian merchant ship &quot;Irvingbrook&quot;. However, a cold front associated with the shortwave encountered the hurricane, which caused it to transition into an extratropical cyclone on September 26. Frieda&#x27;s extratropical remnants later passed over Newfoundland. Though Frieda remained far from any land masses, a peak rainfall amount of was measured in Bermuda.
=== Unnamed October tropical storm ===
On October 22, an area of thunderstorm activity developed north of the Lesser Antilles, and barometric pressures fell throughout the region. The following day, a cut-off low developed and strengthened along the edge of a trough extending from Bermuda. This justified the classification of the system as a tropical depression on October 23, northeast of Puerto Rico. Moving towards the west, the depression attained tropical storm strength shortly after formation. A ship reported a minimum pressure of 999 mbar (hPa; 29.50 inHg) in the storm&#x27;s vicinity. The large system gradually strengthened the following day, reaching its peak intensity by 1800 UTC on October 24. A ship reported a minimum pressure of 993 mbar (hPa; 29.33 inHg) early the next day, the lowest pressure measured in association with the tropical storm. At the same time, the tropical storm also recurved towards the northeast. Heading towards more northerly latitudes, a gradual weakening trend began, due to the presence of an extratropical system. The tropical storm was itself absorbed by the same system on October 27. This storm may not have been named operationally due to a lack of discernible tropical characteristics.
== Storm names ==
The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1957. This was a completely new set of names, thus every name used this season was used for the first time.

=== Retirement ===
Due to the extensive damage and high fatalities, the name &quot;Audrey&quot; was retired by the U.S. Weather Bureau after the 1957 season. The name will never be used to name another Atlantic hurricane.

<doc id="1136297" wikidata="Q505670" url="?curid=1136297" title="Heliand">
<text>The Heliand () is an epic alliterative verse poem in Old Saxon, written in the first half of the 9th century. The title means &quot;savior&quot; in Old Saxon (cf. German and Dutch &quot;Heiland&quot; meaning &quot;savior&quot;), and the poem is a Biblical paraphrase that recounts the life of Jesus in the alliterative verse style of a Germanic epic. &quot;Heliand&quot; is the largest known work of written Old Saxon.

The poem must have been relatively popular and widespread because it exists in two manuscript versions and four fragmentary versions. It takes up about 6,000 lines. A &quot;praefatio&quot; exists, which could have been commissioned by either Louis the Pious (king from 814 to 840) or Louis the German (806–876). This &quot;praefatio&quot; was first printed by Matthias Flacius in 1562, and while it has no authority in the manuscripts it is generally deemed to be authentic. The first mention of the poem itself in modern times occurred when Franciscus Junius (the younger) transcribed a fragment in 1587. It was not printed until 1705, by George Hickes. The first modern edition of the poem was published in 1830 by Johann Andreas Schmeller.

==Historical context==

The &quot;Heliand&quot; was probably written at the request of emperor Louis the Pious around AD 830 to combat Saxon ambivalence toward Christianity. The Saxons were forced to convert to Christianity in the late 8th to early 9th century after 33 years of conflict between the Saxons under Widukind and the Franks under Charlemagne. Around the time that the &quot;Heliand&quot; was written, there was a revolt of the Saxon &quot;stelinga,&quot; or lower social castes. Murphy depicts the significant influence the &quot;Heliand&quot; had over the fate of European society; he writes that the author of the &quot;Heliand&quot; &quot;created a unique cultural synthesis between Christianity and Germanic warrior society – a synthesis that would plant the seed that would one day blossom in the full-blown culture of knighthood and become the foundation of medieval Europe.&quot;

==Manuscripts==

The 9th-century poem on the Gospel history, to which its first editor, J. A. Schmeller, gave the name of Heliand (the word used in the text for Savior, answering to the Old English &quot;hǣlend&quot; and the modern German and Dutch &quot;Heiland&quot;), is, with the fragments of a poem based on the Book of Genesis, all that remains of the poetical literature of the old Saxons, i.e. the Saxons who continued in their original home. It contained when entire about 6000 lines, and portions of it are preserved in two nearly complete manuscripts and four fragments. The Cotton MS. in the British Library, written probably in the second half of the 10th century, is one of the nearly complete manuscripts, ending in the middle of the story of the journey to Emmaus. It is believed to have an organization closer to the original version because it is divided into &quot;fitts,&quot; or songs. The Munich MS., formerly at Bamberg, begins at line 85, and has many lacunae, but continues the history down to the last verse of St. Luke&#x27;s Gospel, ending, however, in the middle of a sentence with the last two &quot;fitts&quot; missing. This manuscript is now retained in Munich at the Bavarian State Library. Because it was produced on calf skin of high quality, it has been preserved in good condition. &quot;Neumes&quot; above the text in this version reveal that the &quot;Heliand&quot; may have been sung. A fragment discovered at Prague in 1881 contains lines 958–1006, and another, in the Vatican Library, discovered by K. Zangemeister in 1894, contains lines 1279–1358. Two additional fragments exist that were discovered most recently. The first was discovered in 1979 at a Jesuit High School in Straubing by B. Bischoff and is currently held in Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. It consists of nearly three leaves and contains 157 poetic lines. The final fragment was found in Leipzig in 2006 by T. Doring and H. U. Schmid. This fragment consists of only one leaf that contains 47 lines of poetry, and it is currently kept at Bibliotheca Albertina.

==Authorship and relation to Old Saxon Genesis==

The poem is based not directly on the New Testament, but on the pseudo-Tatian&#x27;s Gospel harmony, and it demonstrates the author&#x27;s acquaintance with the commentaries of Alcuin, Bede, and Rabanus Maurus.

Early scholarship, notably that of Braune, hypothesized that the &quot;Heliand&quot; was authored by the same hand as the &quot;Old Saxon Genesis&quot;, but scholarly consensus has shifted away from this view; Sievers had already abandoned the hypothesis when Braune published his study. Large parts of that poem are extant only in an Old English translation, known as &quot;Genesis B&quot;. The portions that have been preserved in the original language are contained in the same Vatican manuscript that includes the fragment of the &quot;Heliand&quot; referred to above. In the one language or the other, there are in existence the following three fragments: (I) The passage which appears as lines 235–851 of the Old English verse Genesis in the Caedmon Manuscript (MS Junius 11) (this fragment is known as Genesis B, distinguishing it from the rest of the poem, Genesis A), about the revolt of the angels and the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve. Of this a short part corresponding to lines 790–820 exists also in the original Old Saxon. (2) The story of Cain and Abel, in 124 lines. (3) The account of the destruction of Sodom, in 187 lines. The main source of the Genesis is the Bible, but Eduard Sievers showed that considerable use was made of two Latin poems by Alcimus Avitus, &quot;De initio mundi&quot; and &quot;De peccato originali&quot;.

The two poems give evidence of genius and trained skill, though the poet was no doubt hampered by the necessity of not deviating too widely from the sacred. Within the limits imposed by the nature of his task, his treatment of his sources is remarkably free, the details unsuited for poetic handling being passed over, or, in some instances, boldly altered. In many passages his work gives the impression of being not so much an imitation of the ancient Germanic epic, as a genuine example of it, though concerned with the deeds of other heroes than those of Germanic tradition. In the Heliand, the Saviour and His Apostles are presented as a king and his faithful warriors. While some argue that the use of the traditional epic phrases appears to be not, as with Cynewulf or the author of Andreas, a mere following of accepted models but rather the spontaneous mode of expression of one accustomed to sing of heroic themes, others argue that the &quot;Heliand&quot; was intentionally and methodically composed after careful study of the formula of other German poems. The Genesis fragments have less of the heroic tone, except in the splendid passage describing the rebellion of Satan and his host. It is noteworthy that the poet, like John Milton, sees in Satan no mere personification of evil, but the fallen archangel, whose awful guilt could not obliterate all traces of his native majesty. Somewhat curiously, but very naturally, Enoch the son of Cain is confused with the Enoch who was translated to heaven – an error which the author of the Old English Genesis avoids, though (according to the existing text) he confounds the names of Enoch and Enos.

Such external evidence as exists bearing on the origin of the Heliand and the companion poem is contained in a Latin document printed by Flacius Illyricus in 1562. This is in two parts; the one in prose, entitled (perhaps only by Flacius himself) &quot;Praefatio ad librum antiquum in lingua Saxonica conscriptum&quot; ; the other in verse, headed &quot;Versus de poeta et Interpreta hujus codicis&quot;. The &quot;Praefatio&quot; begins by stating that the emperor Ludwig the Pious, desirous that his subjects should possess the word of God in their own tongue, commanded a certain Saxon, who was esteemed among his countrymen as an eminent poet, to translate poetically into the German language the Old and New Testaments. The poet willingly obeyed, all the more because he had previously received a divine command to undertake the task. He rendered into verse all the most important parts of the Bible with admirable skill, dividing his work into &quot;vitteas&quot;, a term which, the writer says, may be rendered by &quot;lectiones&quot; or &quot;sententias&quot;. The &quot;Praefatio&quot; goes on to say that it was reported that the poet, till then knowing nothing of the art of poetry, had been admonished in a dream to turn into verse the precepts of the divine law, which he did with so much skill that his work surpasses in beauty all other German poetry (&quot;Ut cuncta Theudisca poemata suo vincat decore&quot;). The &quot;Versus&quot; practically reproduce in outline Bede&#x27;s account of Caedmon&#x27;s dream, without mentioning the dream, but describing the poet as a herdsman, and adding that his poems, beginning with the creation, relate the history of the five ages of the world down to the coming of Christ.

==Controversies==

===Authorship===
The suspicion of some earlier scholars that the &quot;Praefatio&quot; and the &quot;Versus&quot; might be a modern forgery is refuted by the occurrence of the word &quot;vitteas&quot;, which is the Old Saxon &quot;fihtea&quot;, corresponding to the Old English &quot;fitt&quot;, which means a canto of a poem. It is impossible that a scholar of the 16th century could have been acquainted with this word, and internal evidence shows clearly that both the prose and the verse are of early origin. The &quot;Versus&quot;, considered in themselves, might very well be supposed to relate to Caedmon; but the mention of the five ages of the world in the concluding lines is obviously due to recollection of the opening of the Heliand (lines 46–47). It is therefore certain that the Versus, as well as the &quot;Praefatio&quot;, attribute to the author of the Heliand a poetic rendering of the Old Testament. Their testimony, if accepted, confirms the ascription to him of the Genesis fragments, which is further supported by the fact that they occur in the same MS. with a portion of the Heliand. As the &quot;Praefatio&quot; speaks of the emperor Ludwig in the present tense, the former part of it at least was probably written in his reign, i.e. not later than AD 840. The general opinion of scholars is that the latter part, which represents the poet as having received his vocation in a dream, is by a later hand, and that the sentences in the earlier part which refer to the dream are interpolations by this second author. The date of these additions, and of the Versus, is of no importance, as their statements are not credible.

That the author of the Heliand was, so to speak, another Caedmon – an unlearned man who turned into poetry what was read to him from the sacred writings – is impossible according to some scholars, because in many passages the text of the sources is so closely followed that it is clear that the poet wrote with the Latin books before him. Other historians, however, argue that the possibility that the author may have been illiterate should not be dismissed because the translations seem free compared to line-by-line translations that were made from Tatian&#x27;s &quot;Diatessaron&quot; in the second quarter of the 9th century into Old High German. Additionally, the poem also shares much of its structure with Old English, Old Norse, and Old High German alliterative poetry which all included forms of heroic poetry that were available only orally and passed from singer to singer. Repetitions of particular words and phrases as well as irregular beginnings of fits (sentences begin at the middle of a line rather than at the beginning of a line to help with alliteration) that occur in the &quot;Heliand&quot; seem awkward as written text but make sense when considering the Heliand formerly as a song for after-dinner singing in the mead hall or monastery. There is no reason for rejecting the almost contemporary testimony of the first part of the Free folio that the author of the Heliand had won renown as a poet before he undertook his great task at the emperor&#x27;s command. It is certainly not impossible that a Christian Saxon, sufficiently educated to read Latin easily, may have chosen to follow the calling of a scop or minstrel instead of entering the priesthood or the cloister; and if such a person existed, it would be natural that he should be selected by the emperor to execute his design. As has been said above, the tone of many portions of the Heliand is that of a man who was no mere imitator of the ancient epic, but who had himself been accustomed to sing of heroic themes.

===German Christianity===
Scholars disagree over whether the overall tone of the &quot;Heliand&quot; lends to the text being an example of a Germanized Christianity or a Christianized Germany. Some historians believe that the German traditions of fighting and enmity are so well pronounced as well as an underlying message of how it is better to be meek than mighty that the text lends more to a Germanized Christianity. Other scholars argue that the message of meekness is so blatant that it renders the text as a stronger representation of a Christianized Germany. This discussion is important because it reveals what culture was more pervasive to the other.

===Use by Luther===
Many historians agree that Martin Luther possessed a copy of the &quot;Heliand&quot;. Luther referenced the &quot;Heliand&quot; as an example to encourage translation of Gospels into the vernacular. Additionally, Luther also favored wording presented in the &quot;Heliand&quot; to other versions of the Gospels. For example, many scholars believe that Luther favored the angel&#x27;s greeting to Mary in the &quot;Heliand&quot; – &quot;you are dear to your Lord&quot; – because he disliked the notion of referring to a human as &quot;full of grace.&quot;

===Extra-canonical origins===
Contention exists over whether the &quot;Heliand&quot; is connected to the Gospel of Thomas. The Gospel of Thomas is a Judaic/Christian version of the Gospels found in 1956 that has been attributed the apostle Thomas. Quispel, a Dutch scholar, argues that the &quot;Heliand&quot; author used a primitive &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, the Gospel harmony written in 160-175 by Tatian and thus has connections to the Gospel of Thomas by this association. Other scholars, such as Krogmann assert that the &quot;Heliand&quot; shares a poetic style of the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; but that the author may not actually have relied on this source and therefore the &quot;Heliand&quot; would have no association to the Gospel of Thomas.

==Editions and translations==
===Editions===
The first complete edition of the &quot;Heliand&quot; was published by J. A. Schmeller in 1830; the second volume, containing the glossary and grammar, appeared in 1840. The standard edition is that of Eduard Sievers (1877), in which the texts of the Cotton and Munich manuscripts are printed side by side. It is not provided with a glossary, but contains an elaborate and most valuable analysis of the diction, synonymy and syntactical features of the poem.

Other useful editions are those of Moritz Heyne (3rd ed., 1903), Otto Behaghel (1882) and Paul Piper (1897, containing also the Genesis fragments). The fragments of the &quot;Heliand&quot; and the &quot;Genesis&quot; contained in the Vatican MS. were edited in 1894 by Karl Zangemeister and Wilhelm Braune under the title &quot;Bruchstücke der altsächsischen Bibeldichtung&quot;.

James E. Cathey wrote &quot;Heliand: Text and Commentary&quot; (2002) (Morgantown: West Virginia University Press, ), which includes an edited version of the text in the original language, commentaries in English and a very useful grammar of Old Saxon along with an appended glossary defining all of the vocabulary found in this version.

<doc id="1136301" wikidata="Q5452061" url="?curid=1136301" title="Fireworks Regulations 2004">
<text>The Fireworks Regulations 2004 impose restrictions on the importation, supply and possession of fireworks in England, Wales and Scotland. The regulations were made under the Fireworks Act 2003.
In particular, the Regulations introduced the following measures:

* a ban on the use of fireworks late at night (after 11 pm) - except for New Year&#x27;s Eve, the night of Diwali and the first day of Chinese New Year - where fireworks may be used until 1 am (on Guy Fawkes Night fireworks may be used until 12 midnight); 
* a ban on the possession of Category 4 fireworks by non-professionals; 
* a ban on persons under the age of 18 possessing fireworks in public places; 
* a ban on the sale of fireworks outside certain &quot;traditional&quot; or minority-cultural periods (such as those listed in the first bullet), unless suppliers are licensed; and, 
* a requirement that importers of fireworks notify HM Revenue and Customs of the storage destination of their imports - the intention being to prevent illegal distribution and dangerous storage.

Some of these regulations are not applicable to Scotland, and none of them applies in Northern Ireland, which has its own, stricter regulations in place. The regulations revoked the Fireworks Regulations 2003 which introduced, as emergency measures, prohibitions on the possession of fireworks by those under the age of 18 and the possession of category 4 fireworks by non-professionals. UK emergency regulations are usually temporary in nature - lasting no more than one year after the date of coming into force.

The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) is responsible for fireworks policy.

<text>A gamelan gadhon is an ensemble consisting of the &#x27;soft&#x27; instruments of the Javanese gamelan. This can include &quot;rebab&quot;, &quot;gendér&quot;, &quot;gendér panerus&quot;, voice, &quot;slenthem&quot;, &quot;suling&quot;, &quot;siter&quot;, gong, &quot;kempul&quot;, &quot;kenong,&quot; and &quot;kendhang&quot;.

==The instruments and their functions==

The &quot;rebab&quot;, a two-stringed fiddle, is the melodic leader of the ensemble. The &quot;rebab&quot; player signals changes between sections of a piece, and to a new piece.

The &quot;gendér&quot; is a tube-resonated metallophone with fourteen keys suspended by string above metal tubes. The &quot;gendér&quot; plays improvisatory patterns called &quot;cengkok&quot; which link one &quot;seleh&quot; note to the next. Each pattern can be played in many ways and the musician chooses how to play each one at the time, according to the style of the piece, the &quot;pathet&quot;, the &quot;irama&quot;, and other musical considerations.

The &quot;slenthem&quot; is a low-pitched tube-resonated metallophone played with a large padded mallet held in one hand, with the other hand is used for damping the ringing key as a new key is sounded. The melodic framework of a piece, sometimes called the &quot;balungan&quot;, is played on the &quot;slenthem&quot;.

The &quot;kendhang&quot;, two-headed drums played with the hands, control the tempo of the music and signal changes in &quot;irama&quot;. Different drums are used according to the style of the music; some lively and others more restrained. The &quot;kendhang&quot; player usually begins and ends on the &quot;ketipung&quot; and &quot;kendhang ageng&quot;, switching to more elaborate patterns on the medium-sized &quot;ciblon&quot; drum.

The gongs — &quot;kempul&quot; (small hanging gongs) and &quot;kenong&quot; (large horizontal gongs) — act as structural markers and punctuate the form, depending on the type of piece being played. The &quot;gong ageng&quot; (large gong) marks the end of each of the largest melodic phrases; these are called &quot;gongan&quot;, and a piece can have one or several of these.

Several other instruments can also be included: the &quot;gambang&quot; (xylophone), &quot;suling&quot; (end-blown bamboo flute), and &quot;siter&quot; (plucked stringed instrument). Vocal parts called &quot;gerong&quot; (for male singers) or &quot;sindhen&quot; (for female singers) can be added in certain sections of pieces, as can &quot;alok&quot;, vocal cries that accent certain parts of the form or melody.

<text>Criminal Minded is the debut studio album by hip-hop group Boogie Down Productions, released on March 3, 1987, by B-Boy Records. It is considered a highly influential hip hop album and one of the first in the gangsta rap genre.

Since its release, the album has been sampled, interpolated and paraphrased. Its samples and direct influences were unusual at the time, ranging from liberal use of dancehall reggae (as well as the more commonly used James Brown) to rock music artists such as AC/DC, the Beatles and Billy Joel. The album was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA. The songs &quot;South Bronx&quot; and &quot;The Bridge Is Over&quot; ignited the rivalry with the Brooklyn-bred but Queens resident emcee MC Shan and the Juice Crew. Throughout the album, KRS-One gives honor and praise to Scott La Rock for producing the album and he mostly goes on about the importance of originality and being &quot;real&quot; instead of a &quot;Sucker MC&quot;.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 444 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and was later ranked number 239 in the 2020 edition.

==Background==

Production on the LP is credited to Blastmaster&#x27; KRS-One (Lawrence Krisna Parker) and DJ Scott La Rock (Scott Sterling), with a special thanks to Ced-Gee (Cedric Miller) of The Ultramagnetic MCs on the back cover.

The cover, which showcases Parker and Sterling surrounded by an arsenal of weapons, was hip-hop&#x27;s first major release to feature members brandishing firearms. The album also contained several hardcore songs such as &quot;9mm Goes Bang&quot;, one of the first hip-hop songs to be based around a first-person crime narrative, and &quot;P Is Free&quot;, which details an encounter with a drug-abusing prostitute.

The liner notes of &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; read, &quot;Peace to Ron Nelson and the Toronto posse.&quot; This statement is evidence of BDP&#x27;s involvement with Toronto&#x27;s hip hop scene in the 1980s, which produced artists such as Michie Mee, Dream Warriors, and Maestro Fresh Wes.

==Controversy==
Initially, the album sold at least several hundred thousand copies; however, the relationship between the group and B-Boy Records quickly deteriorated when the label, headed by Jack Allen and Bill Kamarra, was allegedly slow to pay royalties. A lawsuit was launched, which was eventually settled out-of-court. Having left B-Boy Records, new friend Ice-T introduced BDP to Warner Bros. Records&#x27; Benny Medina, head of the label&#x27;s Black-music division, who promptly agreed to sign the duo in principle to a new record deal. However, the Warner Brothers deal was later rescinded after Scott La Rock&#x27;s murder.

By this time, Sterling had befriended a neighborhood teenager named Derrick &quot;D-Nice&quot; Jones, who did a human beatboxing routine for the group. One evening, Jones was assaulted by some local hoodlums and he later called Sterling to run interference. The next day, Sterling and a group of others came to the stoop where the offending parties lived. Sterling&#x27;s intention was to try and mediate things, but one of the hoods pulled out a gun and began shooting at random. In the ensuing confusion, Sterling was hit in the neck. Critically wounded, he died an hour later in hospital, leaving behind an infant son.

Warner Bros. reneged on the new deal in the aftermath of Sterling&#x27;s death. Parker, however, decided that the group should continue. A handful of friends were brought into the collective, including Parker&#x27;s new wife Ms. Melodie and brother Kenny Parker, with whom he had just recently reunited. Original member and &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; co-producer Lee Smith was dropped by Parker in pursuit of a deal. Signing with Jive/RCA Records, Parker recorded eight albums for that label in a 10-year period, eventually dropping the Boogie Down Productions moniker and billing himself as a solo performer. R.E.M. and others recruited him for collaborations, and he was among the few hip-hop acts at the Beastie Boys&#x27; Tibetan Freedom Concerts.

Meanwhile, &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; became notoriously hard to find, falling in and out of print every few years, surfacing with a different distributor every time. Eventually, the Boston-based independent label LandSpeed Records purchased the rights of the B-Boy Records catalogue, hence a re-release in 2002. An expanded re-release titled &quot;The Best of B-Boy Records: Boogie Down Productions&quot; includes longer versions of the album&#x27;s tracks and several 12-inch singles that didn&#x27;t make &quot;Criminal Minded&quot;&#x27;s original pressing. On Spotify this bumper pack is simply known as Criminal Minded (Deluxe). The album was re-released again in 2006—original art intact—when LandSpeed became Traffic Entertainment Group.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Criminal Minded&quot; has been well received by critics. In 1988, for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column:

In 1998, &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; was selected by &quot;The Source&quot; as one of the 100 Best Rap Albums. &quot;Vibe&quot; included it in its list of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century in 1999, and in 2002, the magazine placed it at number three on its list of the Top 10 Rap Albums. In 2003, the album was ranked number 444 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and was later ranked 239 in the 2020 edition.

&quot;Complex&quot; named the song &quot;South Bronx&quot; as the ninth-best hip hop dis song of all-time.

In 2017, rapper MC Ren named &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; as his all-time favorite hip hop album. MC Ren also heavily sampled &quot;The Bridge Is Over&quot; on his 1992 single &quot;Final Frontier&quot;.

<doc id="1136331" wikidata="Q4520372" url="?curid=1136331" title="1956 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1956 Atlantic hurricane season featured a decent number of tropical cyclones, although most tropical storms and hurricanes affected land. There were twelve tropical storms, a third of which became hurricanes. One of the hurricanes strengthened to the equivalent of a major hurricane, which is a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betsy, which was also the most damaging storm of the season: it destroyed 15,000 houses and left $40 million in damage in Puerto Rico. Betsy was also the deadliest of the season, having killed 18 people in the French West Indies, two from a shipwreck in the Caribbean Sea, and 16 in Puerto Rico. Tropical Storm Dora struck Mexico in September and killed 27 people.

The season officially started on June 15, although an unnamed storm developed about a week prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean. A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June 12 alleviated drought conditions in the south-central United States. Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico. Tropical storms Carla and Ethel both formed near the Bahamas and moved northeastward until dissipating. The only hurricane that hit the contiguous United States was Hurricane Flossy. One of the final storms of the year, Greta, was an unusually large hurricane that produced high waves from Florida to the Lesser Antilles. It developed in the western Caribbean and moved across much of the southeastern United States, causing $24.8 million in damage and 15 deaths.

== Season summary ==

The season officially began on June 15, the date that the Weather Bureau office in Miami, Florida, under the direction of Gordon Dunn, began daily monitoring of all tropical disturbances and cyclones across the northern Atlantic Ocean. The agency had access to the hurricane hunters, a fleet of aircraft that obtain data by flying into storms. The Weather Bureau, in collaboration with other agencies, began a five–year project in 1956 to obtain and analyze data on the structure of hurricanes. The season officially ended on November 15.

There were a total of twelve tropical storms during the season, five of which were unnamed. In all, four storms strengthened into hurricanes. Compared to the average activity from the previous two decades, the season&#x27;s activity was below normal despite average sea surface temperatures and a normal number of tropical waves. Instead, the inactivity was the result of the subtropical ridge being located further south than normal, which decreased the atmospheric instability across much of the basin. Such a pattern was different from the more active 1954 and 1955 seasons. Several tropical depressions formed that did not attain tropical storm status, many of which formed beneath an unfavorable upper-level trough.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 54, which is categorized as being &quot;below normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength. Thus, tropical depressions are excluded from the total.
== Systems ==

=== Early June tropical storm ===

A dissipating cold front off the southeastern United States spawned a low-pressure area on June 6. On the next day, the system organized into a tropical storm off the coast of North Carolina. The storm moved southward and reached peak winds of , based on reports from ships. During its duration, the storm failed to develop an inner core, affected by cool, dry air to the northwest. The structure was likely akin to a subtropical storm, based on its formation beneath an upper-level trough. On June 8, the storm accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, weakening to a tropical depression the next day, and becoming an extratropical cyclone within the front on June 10. The system dissipated later that day as a larger storm developed within the front.
=== Mid-June tropical storm ===

During the second week of June, a tropical wave traversing the Yucatán Peninsula commenced interacting with a trough extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, which generated a disturbance over the Bay of Campeche, that spawned a tropical depression on June 12. The newly developed tropical cyclone tracked northward, quickly intensifying into a tropical storm. It attained peak winds of on June 13, although it never developed a well-defined circulation. In addition, it had characteristics of both a tropical and extratropical cyclone, with cooler air aloft. Late on June 13, the storm made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana, and its lowest pressure of was measured over land, suggesting it did not weaken substantially after landfall. After moving inland, it dissipated on June 15 over Arkansas.

As the storm moved ashore, it did not develop rainbands, unlike other tropical cyclones. The heaviest rainfall occurred in a region east of where it moved ashore. Precipitation fell across the entire United States gulf coast, and the highest rainfall total was in Golden Meadow, Louisiana. The rains were beneficial to farmers, due to drought conditions persisting in the region. The storm produced higher than normal tides, peaking at in Biloxi, Mississippi; this was the highest since the 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane. The tides left damage to the Freeport Sulphur Company, as well as to boats, beaches, and piers. Three people died after their boat capsized, and there was another death after a driver skidded off the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. A barge in the lake became disabled due to the storm and caused light damage to the causeway. Sustained winds during the storm&#x27;s passage peaked at near Grand Isle, Louisiana, and a boat reported a gust of near Pilottown, Louisiana. Damage was estimated at $50,000.
=== Hurricane Anna ===

A westward-moving tropical wave traversed the Lesser Antilles on July 20. It moved across the Caribbean, and its thunderstorms increased on July 23 while passing south of Cuba and beneath a high-pressure area. There is evidence that it could have developed a circulation on July 24 before it struck the Yucatán Peninsula. It is confirmed to have developed into a tropical depression on July 25 in the Bay of Campeche. As it continued west-northwestward, it rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm Anna, and before moving ashore in Mexico near Ozuluama, Veracruz, on July 26 it attained hurricane status. Peak winds reached , although Anna rapidly dissipated on July 27 as it moved further inland. The high winds wrecked several homes in poor regions of Tampico, Tamaulipas, while rainfall of resulted in flooding. The high winds severed telegraph lines from Tampico to San Luis Potosí. The same area was affected by several hurricanes in the previous year. Damage totaled around $50,000, and there were no deaths.
=== Hurricane Betsy ===
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 4. It developed into Tropical Storm Betsy developed on August 9 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It rapidly developed into a hurricane before striking Guadeloupe with a minimum central pressure of . There, Betsy heavily damaged 1,000 houses and left severe crop destruction, and led to 18 deaths. As Betsy continued into the northeastern Caribbean, it capsized a ship, killing its crew of two. On August 12, a slightly weakened Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico near Maunabo with winds of and quickly crossed the island. Damage was heaviest where it moved ashore and in the territory&#x27;s central portion. 15,023 houses were destroyed by Betsy, and multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy, which reported a complete loss of the corn crop.

After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy strengthened steadily as it headed generally northwestward, becoming a major hurricane on August 13 while centered north of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It attained peak winds of the next day to the east of the Bahamas. Betsy later turned northeastward, attaining its lowest central pressure of on August 17. It later became extratropical early on August 18. The remnants dissipated two days later to the north of the Azores. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the San Juan radar, and also resulted in the first hurricane warning on the island that was released on television. The hurricane left $40 million in damage and 16 deaths, which prompted the declaration of a federal disaster area. Locally the hurricane was known as the Santa Clara Hurricane.
=== Tropical Storm Carla ===

The origins of Tropical Storm Carla were from a tropical wave that spawned a depression near the Bahamas on September 7. It moved generally to the north, intensifying to a tropical storm the following day. An upper-level low located to the northeast of Carla produced hostile conditions that prevented significant strengthening, and Carla had a structure which resembled a subtropical storm. An approaching cold front turned the storm to the northeast, and despite the unfavorable atmosphere, Carla intensified, reaching peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) late on September 9. The interaction between the storm and a high-pressure system over the Great Lakes yielded a strong pressure gradient that produced gale-force winds over New England. After Carla passed to the north of Bermuda, it became extratropical on September 10, according to HURDAT—the official hurricane database—and the annual report in the &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot;. As a post-tropical cyclone, ex-Carla strengthened to before weakening and dissipating by September 16.
=== Tropical Storm Dora ===

On September 10, a tropical depression developed over the Bay of Campeche. Later that day, hurricane hunters observed winds of tropical storm force, indicating that the depression had become Tropical Storm Dora, with winds of about . Dora moved generally westward due to a ridge to its north. A reconnaissance flight on September 11 estimated hurricane-force winds, but reanalysis assessed these as being unrepresentative of Dora&#x27;s true strength. Early on September 12, Dora peaked at shortly before striking land near Tuxpan with a minimum central pressure of . It quickly dissipated early the next day, although the storm produced heavy rains across the region. The deluge caused a landslide as well as flooding, including along a river near San Andrés Tuxtla. In Puebla, there were 13 deaths and 20 injuries after a bus crashed into a washed out portion of the highway from Tuxpan to Mexico City. Overall, Dora caused 27 deaths in the country, but minor damage.
=== Tropical Storm Ethel ===

On September 11, a tropical depression developed along the southern end of a quasi-stationary cold front over Grand Exuma Island in the Bahamas. It moved to the northeast and encountered cold air from the north. This resulted in significant instability that allowed in quick strengthening. A hurricane hunters flight on September 12 reported winds of in the storm&#x27;s northeast quadrant; as a result, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ethel. The flight observed a well-developed eye in diameter, although they only observed hurricane-force winds in one quadrant. Reassessment, however, discounted the observations of hurricane-force winds from the aircraft as being unrepresentative of Ethel&#x27;s strength, and analyzed that Ethel peaked at late on September 12, with the lowest pressure reported being . Shortly after reaching peak intensity, Ethel began weakening and dissipated on September 14 to the southwest of Bermuda.
=== Hurricane Flossy ===
Hurricane Flossy originated from a tropical wave that moved through the Caribbean. A tropical depression formed on September 20 just east of the Yucatán Peninsula and headed northwest across the landmass. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico on September 22, it quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Flossy. Continuing to intensify, the storm turned to the north and attained hurricane status on September 23. Bearing winds of , Flossy struck near Venice, Louisiana, on September 24 after turning to the northeast, crossing the Mississippi River Delta. The hurricane again moved into the Gulf of Mexico, continuing to the northeast and intensifying further until moving ashore near Miramar Beach, Florida, on September 25 as a strong Category 1 hurricane with winds of and a minimum pressure of . Later that day, Flossy became extratropical over Georgia after weakening into a tropical storm. The extratropical remnants moved through the southeast United States and emerged from North Carolina into the western Atlantic on September 27. The storm was last observed on October 3, near southernmost Newfoundland.

Flossy was the only hurricane of the season to strike the United States. Winds in Louisiana reached , although an oil rig offshore Grand Isle reported a gust of . The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at in Golden Meadow, Louisiana. The rainfall and the hurricane&#x27;s accompanying storm surge caused widespread flooding and beach erosion in southeast Louisiana. The flooding surmounted the eastern seawall in New Orleans, submerging an area of . Across the region, the resulting flooding drowned cattle and caused heavy crop damage. Hurricane Flossy left about $27.8 million in damage (1956 USD), mostly from crop damage, as well as 15 deaths. The rainfall extended through the Mid-Atlantic states, which alleviated drought conditions.
=== Early October tropical storm ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa in early October. By October 9, a tropical storm developed with winds of , based on ship reports. On October 10, the storm turned to the north and weakened to a tropical depression. It drifted northeast for two days, dissipating on October 12.
=== Mid-October tropical storm ===

A low-pressure area formed along a dissipating cold front to the north of Puerto Rico. The system moved westward, developing some tropical characteristics by October 13. The next day, the system became a tropical storm over the Straits of Florida. On October 15, it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of . While it is unclear whether this cyclone ever became fully tropical, it is entered into HURDAT as a tropical cyclone. The storm intensified further over the Florida peninsula, peaking at early on October 16. After affecting Florida, the storm crossed the western Atlantic and moved across the Outer Banks. The storm became extratropical on October 17, and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical storm.

The storm produced significant rainfall in a region of Florida. The highest total in the state was in Kissimmee. There, the rains caused flash flooding that entered over 200 houses. The flooding flooded three state highways, and also left portions of Okeechobee inaccessible after reporting the heaviest rainfall in eight years. Large tomato fields were inundated, resulting in some crop damage. In portions of the state, the rains were beneficial due to previously dry conditions. The storm spawned a tornado in North Miami that injured one person. Damage throughout Florida was estimated at $3 million, mostly in the Kissimmee area. In addition, two surfers drowned during the storm. Precipitation extended as far north as New Jersey, and coastal areas experienced high tides and gusty winds.
=== Hurricane Greta ===
The Intertropical Convergence Zone spawned a tropical depression on October 31 a short distance to south of easternmost Cuba. The system tracked northward and crossed over eastern Cuba, and the system initially had characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. It eventually acquired tropical features and intensified into Tropical Storm Greta on November 1. A high-pressure area east of the Mid-Atlantic states caused the depression to turn to the south on November 2 and loop to the southeast. Later that day the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta to the northeast of the Bahamas. It attained hurricane status on November 4 while maintaining a large size (in fact, becoming one of the largest tropical cyclones known in the Atlantic basin); such strengthening is unusual in storms moving in a southeast trajectory. Greta turned to the east and later northeast, reaching its peak of late on November 4 due to the energy transfer between levels of the atmosphere. Cooler waters caused subsequent weakening and gradual loss of tropical characteristics, and Greta transitioned into an extratropical storm on November 6, dissipating the next day.

The extremely large size of Greta, in conjunction with the high-pressure system to its north, produced strong winds and high waves across a large area of the western Atlantic. In Puerto Rico, waves of left heavy damage and killed one person who did not heed an evacuation order. Waves reached in the French West Indies, which destroyed 80% of the structures at the port in Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe. Further west, high waves left heavy damage in and around the beaches of Jacksonville, Florida. Overall damage was estimated at $3.58 million.
=== November tropical storm ===

In the middle of November, a weakening cold front produced a low-pressure area, which organized into a tropical depression early on November 19, though it is possible it formed a day earlier. The depression moved slowly west for the next 12 hours, becoming a tropical storm thereafter. Due to its slow movement, and based on ship reports, it is estimated that peak winds were , with a minimum pressure recorded was 1002 mbar. The system continued to crawl westward, weakening to a depression on November 21 at 12:00 UTC and degenerating later in the day to a trough of low pressure.
=== Other systems ===

A weak circulation developed late on July 4 beneath a cold mid-level trough in the Gulf of Mexico. It moved north-northwestward, and hit near Pensacola, Florida, on July 6. It dissipated on July 7. Although the disturbance did not generate gale force sustained winds, it produced wind gusts of in Panama City, Florida. As it moved ashore, the system dropped heavy amounts of precipitation, with a total of reported in Whatley, Alabama. The rains washed away or eroded several highways and bridges, and also resulted in some agricultural damage. A train line from Mobile to Birmingham, Alabama, was washed out near Suggsville. Overall the damage was estimated at $503,000, and there were no associated deaths.

A vigorous tropical wave spawned a possible tropical depression on August 28 near the Cape Verde islands. A weather station on the island of Sal recorded a minimum central pressure of on August 31. Ships in the area reported winds as strong as as the storm moved through the islands. However, the ship and land data was insufficient to establish whether the system had developed a closed low level circulation. It maintained a general westward track, eventually dissipating on September 6 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles.

<text>Charles W. Sawyer (February 10, 1887April 7, 1979) was an American lawyer and diplomat who served as the United States Secretary of Commerce from May 6, 1948 to January 20, 1953 in the administration of Harry Truman.

==Early life==
Sawyer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on February 10, 1887. He was a son of Caroline (née Butler) Sawyer and Edward Milton Sawyer, a Maine Republican who moved to Ohio become a principal.

He attended Oberlin College, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1908, followed by the University of Cincinnati, where he received his law degree in 1911.

==Career==
===Early career===

He served as a member of Cincinnati City Council from 1912 until 1916 when he ran for Mayor of Cincinnati losing to George Puchta. Prior to his political career, he worked at the Cincinnati law firm of Dinsmore &amp; Shohl.

===Military service===
In August 1917, Sawyer joined the military for World War I, and was commissioned from civilian life as a captain of Infantry. After completing initial training at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, he served with the 158th Depot Brigade Camp Sherman, Ohio and was assigned as the post&#x27;s provost marshal. In August 1918, he was promoted to Major. He then served in France as adjutant of the 178th Infantry Brigade, a unit of the 89th Division. After the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war, Sawyer continued to serve in Europe as part of the Occupation of the Rhineland. He returned to the United States in May 1919, and was discharged on 31 May. Following his wartime service, Sawyer frequently participated in veterans events, and was a longtime member of the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars.

===Post-war career===
Sawyer was also involved in several business ventures, including the American Rolling Mill Company and a share of the Cincinnati Reds, the Cincinnati Gardens, and a chain of newspapers and radio stations (through Great Trails Broadcasting Corporation).

Between the Wars, he was a prominent Ohio Democratic politician. In the 1930s, a faction led by Sawyer vied with a faction led by Martin L. Davey for control of the state Democratic party. He was the 44th lieutenant governor of Ohio from 1933 to 1935. Sawyer authored the Twenty-first Amendment which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which established the prohibition of alcohol in the United States. From 1936 to 1944, Sawyer served as a member of the Democratic National Committee. In 1938, he was an unsuccessful candidate for governor of Ohio.

===Federal service===

In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Sawyer as the United States Ambassador to Belgium and served as was Minister to Luxembourg during the difficult period from 1944 to 1946, at the beginning of the Belgian Royal Question concerning King Leopold III of Belgium. Two years later, President Harry Truman appointed Sawyer to the U.S. Civil Service Commission&#x27;s Review Board. Sawyer had first met Truman upon the latter&#x27;s arrival in Antwerp en route to Germany to attend the Potsdam Conference.

In 1948, Sawyer was chosen to succeed W. Averell Harriman as the United States Secretary of Commerce. While Secretary of Commerce, Sawyer was ordered by Truman to seize and operate the steel mills in 1952. This seizure was executed to prevent a labor strike which Truman believed would hamper the ability of the United States to proceed in the war in Korea.

While Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Sawyer declared the first National Secretaries Week from June 1 to 7, 1952. He designated Wednesday, June 4, as National Secretaries Day for this formerly male-dominated field of work turned female-dominated by sociocultural anamorphisms. Upon the end of Truman&#x27;s term as office, Sawyer&#x27;s term as Commerce Secretary also ended and he was succeeded by the Republican Sinclair Weeks who served during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

===Later career===
When Sawyer returned to Cincinnati after serving President Truman, he joined the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister, which had been founded by another prominent Cincinnati politician, Robert A. Taft (the elder son of President William Howard Taft), and became its managing partner. Following Taft&#x27;s death, Sawyer succeeded to his seat on the board of the Central Trust Company, a Cincinnati bank.

In 1968, he authored &quot;Concerns of a Conservative Democrat&quot; which was published by the Southern Illinois University Press. Sawyer served on the Hoover Commission on Overseas Economic Operations Task Force, the Commission on Money and Credit, and the World&#x27;s Fair Site Committee.

Sawyer gave $1 million to purchase 123 acres of riverfront property in Cincinnati for what became Sawyer Point Park.

==Personal life==
On July 15, 1918 Sawyer married his first wife, Margaret Sterrett Johnston, a niece of Col. William Cooper Procter of Procter &amp; Gamble. Together, they had five children, two daughters and three sons, including: Anne Johnston Sawyer (who married John Pattison Williams. She later married John Bradley Greene); Charles W. Sawyer II; Jean Johnston Sawyer (who married the Very Rev. John J. Weaver, Dean of Detroit Cathedral, in 1948); John William Sawyer; and Edward Milton Sawyer.

After Margaret&#x27;s death in 1937, Sawyer married his second wife, Countess Elizabeth (née Lippelman) de Veyrac (1907-1999), on June 10, 1942. Elizabeth, who was living in Glendale, Ohio, was previously married to Louis Renner of Cincinnati and then Count Robert de Veyrac. They had no children.

He died in April 1979, at age 92, at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. He was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery near his birthplace in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<text>Charles Sinclair Weeks (June 15, 1893February 7, 1972), better known as Sinclair Weeks, was an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Massachusetts in 1944 and as United States Secretary of Commerce from 1953 until 1958, during President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s administration.

==Biography==
Born in West Newton, Massachusetts, Weeks was the second child of John Wingate Weeks, who was a United States congressman and Secretary of War, and Martha Aroline Sinclair. His older sister was Katherine Weeks, wife of John Washington Davidge. Weeks graduated from Harvard College, served on the U.S.-Mexico border with the U.S. National Guard in 1916, and served in World War I. He was a businessman in various industries, including the First National Bank of Boston, the United Carr Fastener Corporation and as President of Reed &amp; Barton of Taunton Massachusetts.

He served as mayor of Newton, Massachusetts from 1930 to 1935. He was a United States senator from Massachusetts from February 8, 1944, when he was appointed by Governor Leverett Saltonstall following the resignation of Henry C. Lodge Jr., who went to serve in World War II, until December 19, 1944, when a new senator was elected. Weeks did not run in that election. Weeks was a member of the United States Republican Party and served as the member of a Republican National Committee from 1941 to 1953. He was the treasurer of the party from 1940 to 1944. Weeks was the president of the American Enterprise Association from 1946 to 1950.

President Dwight Eisenhower appointed him the United States Secretary of Commerce from January 21, 1953, until November 10, 1958. Among the signature initiatives of the Eisenhower administration with which Weeks was involved was the Interstate Highway system of 1956. As Secretary of Commerce, he was charged with securing funding for the project.

Weeks married the former Beatrice Lee Dowse of Newton MA on December 4, 1915. She was the daughter of William Bradford Homer Dowse, Esq., President of Reed &amp; Barton Silversmiths and granddaughter of Henry Gooding Reed, co-founder of Reed &amp; Barton Silversmiths (1824 - 2015), They had three sons and three daughters, Frances Lee Weeks Hallowell Lawrence, John Wingate Weeks III, Martha Sinclair Weeks Sherrill, Sinclair Weeks Jr, William D. Weeks and Beatrice Weeks Bast. His wife died July 10, 1945, in Lancaster NH. Weeks married Jane Tompkins Rankin of Nashville TN on January 3, 1948. In 1968 he married Alice Requa Palmer Low of San Francisco, CA - widow of Admiral Francis S. Low. He had no children by his second or third wives.

In 1941, he and his sister Katherine Weeks Davidge had given their father&#x27;s summer estate on Mt. Prospect in Lancaster to the State of New Hampshire to be a State Park. They intended the historic Arts &amp; Crafts-style 1913 Lodge and 1912 Observation Tower on the summit to educate the public about sustainable forestry management. Today Weeks State Park, with its historic 1910 NH Scenic Byway road to the top, Lodge and Tower, attracts thousands of visitors annually to enjoy a panoramic 360-degree view of the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Green Mountains of Vermont.

Due to the illness of his second wife, in 1958 Weeks retired to his farm in Lancaster, New Hampshire.

In the 1960s, Weeks worked with his friend and Republican colleague New Hampshire Governor Sherman Adams and others to ensure that Interstate 93 did not destroy the fragile environment of Franconia Notch State Park through which the Interstate was intended to run. As a result, Interstate 93 is transformed into the unique eight-mile long scenic Franconia Notch State Parkway before reverting to a major US Interstate. He died on February 7, 1972, at age 78, in Concord, Massachusetts. He is buried in Summer Street Cemetery in Lancaster, New Hampshire.

<text>Santa Cruz da Graciosa () is a Portuguese municipality on the volcanic island of Graciosa, in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 4,391, in an area of 60.66 km2. It includes four local parishes and one municipal government structure, which administers the entire island.

==History==
While the date of its first discovery is uncertain, it is known that its first settlers arrived from the island of Terceira around 1450. One of the first settlers was Vasco Gil Sodre.

The island&#x27;s volcanic soil is rich and supports cultivation of fruits, grains and grapes used in winemaking. The early settlement was primarily agrarian, but by 1486 its population had grown sufficiently to warrant the founding of the &quot;vila&quot; (or town) of Santa Cruz in 1486, while Praia lost this role.

Between the 16th-17th century, Graciosa was regularly attacked by pirates and privateers, which obliged the local government to construct fortifications along the island&#x27;s coast for defense.

Over the centuries Santa Cruz was visited by important travellers. The Jesuit António Vieira, who stopped in the village after a shipwreck while returning to Lisbon from Brazil. Later the French writer Chateaubriand, in 1791, whilst fleeing the horrors of the French Revolution stopped in Graciosa en route to America. In 1814, a young Almeida Garret wrote some of his first verses, already a revelation of his budding talents. Finally, in 1879, Prince Albert of Monaco, notable for his oceanographic and maritime studies, stopped in Graciosa and visited Furna do Enxofre. He was one of the first to descend the volcanic chamber using a rope ladder.

The construction of the port in Praia, and the northern aerodrome, were important in breaking the island&#x27;s isolation and concentration on agriculture.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
===Human geography===
The territory of Graciosa Island consists of one municipality, Santa Cruz da Graciosa (4,780 inhabitants in 2001), which is divided into four civil parishes:

* Santa Cruz - the seat of the municipality and principal urbanized population on the island, located on eastern coast;
* São Mateus da Praia - a historic village and once-municipal seat, until it was unincorporated in the 19th century;
* Guadalupe - the principal rural population on the island;
* Luz - civil parish better known locally as &quot;Sul&quot; (South), located along the southern coast of the island.

The population centers on the island, apart from appearing dispersed, are concentrated along the road network. This is typical of many of other Azorean islands, usually colonized along important corridors corresponding to river-valleys or open terrains. Consequently, urban development has been conditioned by the islands geomorphology resulting in four principal axes of settlement supporting 80% of the islands population:
* along the valley separating the Caldeira Massif from the rest of the island, between the village of Praia and Carapacho, Fonte do Mato, Pedras Brancas and Luz;
* around Serra das Fontes, the axis between Santa Cruz and Santo Amaro, including Fontes and Guadelope, as well as two branches to Pontal by way of Pedras Brancas, and southeast to include Almas, Manuel Gaspar, Ribeirinha and Brasileira;
* from Santa Cruz to Rebentão, around Pico da Hortelã, and northeast to Vitória;
* from Dores to Bom Jesus and along the coast to Vitória, this region is a vast landscape of many disperse settlements, different from the rest of the island.

<doc id="1136348" wikidata="Q1622794" url="?curid=1136348" title="Hoeffding's inequality">
<text>In probability theory, Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality provides an upper bound on the probability that the sum of bounded independent random variables deviates from its expected value by more than a certain amount. Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality was proven by Wassily Hoeffding in 1963.

Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality is a special case of the Azuma–Hoeffding inequality and McDiarmid&#x27;s inequality. It is similar to the Chernoff bound, but tends to be less sharp, in particular when the variance of the random variables is small. It is similar to, but incomparable with, one of Bernstein&#x27;s inequalities.

== Statement ==
Let be independent random variables such that formula_1 almost surely. Consider the sum of these random variables,

:formula_2

Then Hoeffding&#x27;s theorem states that, for all ,
:formula_3

Here is the expected value of .

Note that the inequalities also hold when the have been obtained using sampling without replacement; in this case the random variables are not independent anymore. A proof of this statement can be found in Hoeffding&#x27;s paper. For slightly better bounds in the case of sampling without replacement, see for instance the paper by .

=== Generalization ===
Let formula_4 be independent observations such that formula_5 and formula_6. Let formula_7. Then, for any formula_8,formula_9

=== Special Case: Bernoulli RVs ===

Suppose formula_10 and formula_11 for all &quot;i&quot;. This can occur when &quot;Xi&quot; are independent Bernoulli random variables, though they need not be identically distributed. Then we get the inequality
:formula_12
or equivalently,

formula_13

for all formula_14. This is a version of the additive Chernoff bound which is more general, since it allows for random variables that take values between zero and one, but also weaker, since the Chernoff bound gives a better tail bound when the random variables have small variance.

== General case of bounded from above random variables ==

Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality can be extended to the case of bounded from above random variables.

Let be independent random variables such that formula_15 and formula_16 almost surely. 
Denote by
:formula_17

Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality for bounded from above random variables states that for all formula_14,
:formula_19
In particular, if formula_20 for all formula_21,
then for all formula_14,
:formula_23

== General case of sub-Gaussian random variables ==

The proof of Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality can be generalized to any sub-Gaussian distribution. Recall that a random variable is called sub-Gaussian, if 

:formula_24

for some formula_25. For any bounded variable , formula_26 for formula_27 for some sufficiently large . Then formula_28 for all formula_29 so taking formula_30 yields

:formula_31

for formula_29. So every bounded variable is sub-Gaussian.

For a random variable , the following norm is finite if and only if is sub-Gaussian:

:formula_33

Then let be zero-mean independent sub-Gaussian random variables, the general version of the Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality states that:

:formula_34

where &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 is an absolute constant.

== Proof ==
The proof of Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality follows similarly to concentration inequalities like Chernoff bounds. The main difference is the use of Hoeffding&#x27;s Lemma:

::Suppose is a real random variable such that formula_35 almost surely. Then
::::formula_36

Using this lemma, we can prove Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality. As in the theorem statement, suppose are independent random variables such that formula_37 almost surely for all &quot;i&quot;, and let formula_38.

Then for , Markov&#x27;s inequality and the independence of implies:

:formula_39

This upper bound is the best for the value of minimizing the value inside the exponential. This can be done easily by optimizing a quadratic, giving

:formula_40

Writing the above bound for this value of , we get the desired bound:

:formula_41

==Usage==
===Confidence intervals===

Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality can be used to derive confidence intervals. We consider a coin that shows heads with probability and tails with probability . We toss the coin times, generating samples formula_42 (which are i.i.d Bernoulli random variables). The expected number of times the coin comes up heads is . Furthermore, the probability that the coin comes up heads at least times can be exactly quantified by the following expression:

:formula_43

where is the number of heads in coin tosses.

When for some , Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality bounds this probability by a term that is exponentially small in :

:formula_44

Since this bound holds on both sides of the mean, Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality implies that the number of heads that we see is concentrated around its mean, with exponentially small tail.

:formula_45

Thinking of formula_46 as the &quot;observed&quot; mean, this probability can be interpreted as the level of significance formula_47 (probability of making an error) for a confidence interval around formula_48 of size 2:

:formula_49

Finding for opposite inequality sign in the above, i.e. that violates inequality but not equality above, gives us:

:formula_50

Therefore, we require at least formula_51 samples to acquire a formula_52-confidence interval formula_53.

Hence, the cost of acquiring the confidence interval is sublinear in terms of confidence level and quadratic in terms of precision. Note that there are more efficient methods of estimating a confidence interval.

<text>Neville Dickie (born 1 January 1937 in Durham) is an English boogie-woogie and stride piano player. He has performed all over Europe and North America.

==Career==
After serving in the RAF, Dickie left Durham and moved to London, where he began playing piano for small wages in various pubs. It was only after Doreen Davies, who was head of BBC Radio 2, noticed him at a BBC audition that he took a notable stride in his musical career. He has played on hundreds of BBC Radio broadcasts.

Dickie has produced scores of records and can be heard on hundreds of jazz recordings, as well as several recordings with the French pianist, Louis Mazetier. Dickie had a Top 40 UK hit single in 1969 with &quot;Robin&#x27;s Return&quot; on the Major Minor Records label (MM 644). It reached number 33 on the UK Singles Chart.

His album &quot;Back to Boogie&quot; (1975) has sold over 100,000 copies. Dickie formed a band called the Rhythmakers in 1985 and continued to perform with that group and with his trio. When in the United States he frequently appeared with The Midiri Brothers and is annually hosted by the Tri-State Jazz Society for mid-Atlantic appearances. He also regularly appeared at the Scott Joplin International Ragtime Festival in Sedalia, Missouri, and other major jazz festivals around the United States.

<text>Déjà Vu, is the second studio album by American folk rock group Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and their first as a quartet with Neil Young. Released on March 11, 1970, by Atlantic Records, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for one week and generated three Top 40 singles: &quot;Woodstock&quot;, &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;, and &quot;Our House&quot;. It was re-released in 1977 and an expanded edition was released in 2021 to mark its fiftieth anniversary.

In 2003, the album was ranked No. 148 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and later was ranked No. 220 on the 2020 edition of the list. Certified 7× platinum by RIAA, the album&#x27;s sales currently sit at over 8 million copies. It remains the highest-selling album of each member&#x27;s career to date.

==Recording==
The album was recorded between July 1969 and January 1970 at Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio C in San Francisco, and Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood. It was produced by all four members of the band. Stephen Stills estimates that the album took around 800 hours of studio time to record; this figure may be exaggerated, even though the individual tracks display meticulous attention to detail. The songs, except for &quot;Woodstock,&quot; &quot;Almost Cut my Hair,&quot; and &quot;Helpless,&quot; were recorded as individual sessions by each member, with each contributing whatever was needed that could be agreed upon. Young appears on only half of the tracks, with Nash stating he &quot;generally recorded his tracks alone in Los Angeles then brought them back to the recording studio to put our voices on, then took it away to mix it&quot;.

Young&#x27;s &quot;Helpless&quot; was released on his &quot;Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 (1963-1972)&quot; in 2009 in a different mix with a harmonica introduction. His other contribution, &quot;Country Girl&quot;, combined two Buffalo Springfield songs, &quot;Down, Down, Down&quot; and &quot;Whiskey Boot Hill,&quot; (also released on his &quot;Archives&quot;) with a recently written title chorus.

Commenting on the album to &quot;Hit Parader&quot; in 1971, Stills stated &quot;getting that second album out of us was like pulling teeth, there was song after song that didn&#x27;t make it. The track &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; must have meant 100 takes in the studio. But &quot;Carry On&quot; happened in a grand total of eight hours from conception to finished master. So you never know.&quot;

It was during these sessions that Crosby would break down and cry due to the recent death of his girlfriend Christine Hinton, telling &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; in 1974 &quot;I was not at my best as a functioning person, ... completely unable to deal with it all.&quot;

Nash stated to &quot;Music Radar&quot;, &quot;the mood was different from the first album, which was recorded while the band members were in relationships, and by the second Joni and I had split up, Stephen and Judy had split up, and Christine had just been killed. It was all dark.&quot;

During this time members were not getting along, as they would critique each other&#x27;s contributions, causing friction, with Crosby stating to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;I kept &quot;Almost Cut My Hair&quot; in there over the protestations of Stephen, who didn&#x27;t want me to leave it in &#x27;cause he thought that it was a bad vocal.&quot;

Stills brought &quot;Woodstock&quot; into the band, having already worked out the arrangement for it while playing with Jimi Hendrix in September 1969; this was released on the 2018 Hendrix album &quot;Both Sides of the Sky&quot;. The final version had Stills singing a slightly rearranged version of Mitchell&#x27;s lyrics. &quot;Woodstock&quot; was one of the few &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; tracks where Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young all performed their parts in the same session. Later the original lead vocal by Stills was partly replaced with a later vocal also recorded by Stills, who recalled: &quot;I replaced one and a half verses that were excruciatingly out of tune.&quot; Young disagreed, saying that &quot;the track was magic. Then later on [Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash] were in the studio nitpicking [with the result that] Stephen erased the vocal and put another one on that wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.&quot; Stills also made Nash change &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; from a &quot;Henry VIII&quot; style song to a hit record with a &quot;country swing&quot;.

Drummer Dallas Taylor and bassist Greg Reeves play on the majority of tracks, and are credited on the cover with their names in slightly smaller typeface. Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;, and former Lovin&#x27; Spoonful leader John Sebastian plays harmonica on the title track.

==Release==
By January 1970, Atlantic records had taken in $2 million in preorders; anticipation for the album was high. &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; was released on March 11, 1970, under Atlantic Records, catalogue SD 7200. It was re-released in 1977 as SD-19188 and the cover was changed from black to brown in some foreign releases.

It was certified Gold in the US, 14 days after release on March 25, 1970, spending 88 weeks in the Billboard 200 charts.

Four singles were released from the album with all but the last, &quot;Carry On&quot;, charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song &quot;Country Girl&quot; by Young is a suite put together from three song fragments entitled &quot;Whiskey Boot Hill&quot;, &quot;Down Down Down&quot;, and &quot;Country Girl (I Think You&#x27;re Pretty)&quot;, and is so identified in the credits.

The album was issued on compact disc a second time on September 6, 1994, after being remastered from the original tapes at Ocean View Digital by Joe Gastwirt.

== Reception ==

Contemporary reception was mixed, with Robert Christgau saying that there were &quot;five or seven memorable tunes&quot; and that it was &quot;Young&#x27;s guitar—with help from Stills and hired hands Taylor and Reeves—that make the music work, not those blessed harmonies&quot;.

Langdon Winner wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that, despite the addition of Young, the sound &quot;is still too sweet, too soothing, too perfect, and too good to be true&quot;. He has high praise for &quot;Carry On&quot;, &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; and &quot;Helpless&quot; on Side One. Side Two has &quot;precision playing, glittering harmonies, a relaxed but forceful rhythm, and impeccable twelve-string guitars&quot; but no first rate songs. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;Tight. Uptight, even.&quot;

Nick Logan and Bob Woffinden, of &quot;ZigZag&quot; and &quot;The New Musical Express&quot;, were critical of Crosby&#x27;s and Nash&#x27;s contributions, while stating that all of the other songs were &quot;easily outclassed by the immensely superior material of Young.&quot;

==Legacy==
The popularity of the album contributed to the success of the four albums released by each of the members in the wake of &quot;Déjà vu&quot; – Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, Stephen Stills&#x27; self-titled solo debut, David Crosby&#x27;s &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot;, and Graham Nash&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot;. In 2003, the album was placed at number 148 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, moving up to 147 in a 2012 revised listing, and then down to number 220 in a 2020 revised listing. The TV network VH1 named &quot;Déjà vu&quot; the 61st greatest album of all time. It was voted number 106 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).

&quot;Déjà Vu&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2023.

In 2012, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1136358" wikidata="Q864450" url="?curid=1136358" title="Biola University">
<text>Biola University () is a private, nondenominational, evangelical Christian university in La Mirada, California. It was founded in 1908 as the Bible Institute of Los Angeles. It has over 150 programs of study in nine schools offering bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.

== History ==

Biola University was founded in 1908 as the Bible Institute of Los Angeles by Lyman Stewart, president of the Union Oil Company of California; Thomas C. Horton, a Presbyterian minister and author; and Augustus B. Prichard, also a Presbyterian minister.

In 1912, the institute appointed R. A. Torrey as dean, and in 1913 began construction on a building at the corner of Sixth and Hope St. in downtown Los Angeles, which included a 3,500-seat auditorium, two large neon signs (added later) on top of the building proclaiming &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;, and a carillon of 11 bells on which hymns were played three times each day. The early leaders wanted the institute to focus on training students in the Bible and missions rather than the broad approach to Christian education typical of Christian liberal arts colleges. The institute offered a diploma after completion of a two-year curriculum. This model was based largely on the Moody Bible Institute. Beginning in the 1920s, attempts were made to broaden the curriculum, but it was not until 1949 that the institution took the name &quot;Biola College&quot; and in 1981 was renamed &quot;Biola University&quot;. Biola re-located to La Mirada, California in 1959.

The school has a tradition of conservative theology, documented in the 1917 four-volume version of &quot;The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth&quot;.

As of 1925, John Murdoch MacInnis was the school&#x27;s second dean. He was a Presbyterian minister who had been an instructor at the school for about two years. MacInnis served as dean until his forced resignation on December 31, 1928. His administration had been turbulent. In 1927, Biola published a book by MacInnis entitled &quot;Peter the Fisherman Philosopher&quot;, which became the focus of an intense national controversy in which MacInnis was accused by fundamentalists of advocating liberal theological positions. Eventually, MacInnis was forced to resign, and all remaining copies of the book, along with the printing plates, were destroyed.

In 1929, Charles E. Fuller a businessman, evangelist, and graduate of Biola, was drafted as vice president to find a new dean and a president. Elbert McCreery and William P. White, both associated with Moody Bible Institute, were chosen to fill these posts.

During the Great Depression, the institute suffered serious financial difficulties. In 1932, Louis T. Talbot, pastor of the Church of the Open Door, assumed the presidency and helped raise much-needed funds. During the next two decades, Talbot concentrated efforts on academic programs as the school&#x27;s mission. Talbot Theological Seminary became Biola&#x27;s first graduate school and in 1977, Biola acquired the graduate programs of Rosemead Graduate School of Professional Psychology and relocated them to the La Mirada campus. Biola added a School of Intercultural Studies in 1983, through funds from the abandoned property of the Hunan Bible Institute in China, a School of Business in 1993, and a School of Education in 2007.

===Presidents===
* William P. White (1929–1932)
* Louis T. Talbot (1932–1935)
* Paul W. Rood (1935–1938)
* Louis T. Talbot (1938–1952)
* Samuel H. Sutherland (1952–1970)
* J. Richard Chase (1970–1982)
* Clyde Cook (1982–2007)
* Barry Corey (2007– )

== Conferences ==

Biola holds two annual student conferences, the Missions Conference during the spring semester and the Torrey Memorial Bible Conference during the fall semester.

The Torrey Memorial Bible Conference is also a three-day conference dedicated to students&#x27; spiritual growth. Every year, a specific topic is chosen that is geared towards the typical college student&#x27;s spiritual needs.

The annual one-day Biola Media Conference seeks to advance the integration of faith and the arts. It brings together Christian media leaders and other Christians for education, inspiration, and networking.

On November 16, 1996, the university hosted the first national conference on intelligent design. Later, Intervarsity Press published &quot;Mere Creation&quot;, a collection of the papers presented at the conference. Subsequent intelligent-design conferences were held at the university in 2002 and 2004.

Since 2015, Biola requires students to attend five conference sessions and twenty chapel services per semester, or face a financial penalty.

==Center for Messianic Jewish Studies==
On October 8, 2007, Biola opened the Charles L. Feinberg Center for Messianic Jewish Studies in Manhattan. The center offers a master&#x27;s degree in divinity in Messianic Jewish studies in cooperation with Chosen People Ministries.

==Academics==

It offers biblically integrated courses and programs that exist to train those who desire to make an impact as educators and administrators in public, private, homeschool, charter and international schools. At the undergraduate level, the School of Education is home to the elementary education, multidisciplinary majors and liberal studies, which consistently rank among the most popular undergraduate majors at Biola. At the graduate level, the School of Education offers Master of Arts in Teaching and Master of Arts in Education programs.

===Honors program===
Torrey Honors College, formerly Torrey Honors Institute, is a classical literature great books program started by John Mark Reynolds in 1995 and named after Reuben Archer Torrey. Classes in the department are used to meet most of the general education requirements at Biola University in four years; the program does not offer a major or minor. The Torrey Honors College is patterned after the Oxford tutorial system, employing reading, discussion, writing, mentoring, and lectures.

== Student organizations ==
Biola has over 40 student organizations and clubs.

In May 2012, an underground LGBTQ community, calling themselves the Biola Queer Underground, launched a website in support of promoting dialogue and reconsideration of Biola&#x27;s expulsion policy regarding homosexual behavior. The covert group requested to be accepted as a facet of diversity within the campus, declaring that, despite traditional church teaching on homosexuality, they held similar Christian beliefs and values to the university. The website garnered national attention from the mainstream media. The Biola administration released a formal statement on their conservative Christian views on human sexuality shortly afterwards. Since 2013, The Dwelling, a university-sanctioned LGBTQ organization, has been established. It seeks to support LGBT students without endorsing same-sex marriage and related policies.

== Athletics ==
The Biola athletic teams are called the Eagles. The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Pacific West Conference (PacWest) since the 2017–18 academic year; while its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving teams compete in the Pacific Collegiate Swim and Dive Conference (PCSC).

The Eagles continued as an active member of the GSAC and the NAIA for the 2016–17 school year while completing Provisional Year One with the NCAA. In Provisional Year Two (2017–18), Biola joined the PacWest Conference and competed primarily against NCAA opponents. With successful completion of Provisional Year Three (2018–19) of the membership process, the Eagles will gain full, active NCAA D-II membership and become eligible to compete for NCAA Division II championships beginning as early as 2019–20.

In 2012, the Biola University Center for Christian Thought (CCT) was launched, funded by a $3.03 million grant from the John Templeton Foundation, the largest academic grant ever awarded to Biola University. The CCT is a forum where leading Christian thinkers from around the world gather to research and discuss issues of significance to the academy, the church, and the broader culture. In 2013, the Biola University Center for Christianity, Culture and the Arts (CCCA) was launched, funded with a grant from philanthropists Howard and Roberta Ahmanson&#x27;s Fieldstead and Company. The CCCA sponsors events and symposia, produces online resources and strives to facilitate thoughtful reflection on the interplay of Christian faith, the larger culture and the world of the arts. 

In October 2014, Biola launched the Center for Marriage and Relationships (CMR). The center exists to build and sustain healthy relationships and marriages in the church and broader culture. 

In Fall of 2017, Biola launched the Center for the Study of the Work and Ministry of the Holy Spirit Today, funded by a $3 million donation. Located within Talbot School of Theology, the center is a 10-year initiative that provides resources for students and scholars.

== Publications ==
The university has been involved in the publication of the following magazines and academic journals:
* &quot;The King&#x27;s Business&quot; was a monthly publication of Biola from 1910 to 1970. In the first decades of its publication, it was the leading journal for conservative Christianity and the early fundamentalist movement.

* &quot;Journal of Psychology and Theology&quot; has as its purpose to communicate recent scholarly thinking on the interrelationships of psychological and theological concepts, and to consider the application of these concepts to a variety of professional settings. The major intent of the editor is to place before the evangelical community articles that have bearing on the nature of humankind from a Biblical perspective.
* &quot;Journal of Spiritual Formation and Soul Care&quot; has as its purpose advancing the discussion of the theory and practice of Christian formation and soul care for the sake of the educational ministries of the church, Christian education, and other para-church organizations through scholarly publications that are rooted in Biblical exegesis, systematic theology, the history of Christian spirituality, philosophical analysis, psychological theory/research, spiritual theology, and Christian experience.

<text>1,000,000,000 (one billion, short scale; one thousand million or one milliard, one yard, long scale) is the natural number following 999,999,999 and preceding 1,000,000,001. With a number, &quot;billion&quot; can be abbreviated as b, bil or bn.

In standard form, it is written as 1 × 109. The metric prefix giga indicates 1,000,000,000 times the base unit. Its symbol is [[Giga-|G]].

One billion years may be called an &quot;eon&quot; in astronomy or geology.

Previously in British English (but not in American English), the word &quot;billion&quot; referred exclusively to a million millions (1,000,000,000,000). However, this is not common anymore, and the word has been used to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000) for several decades.

The term milliard could also be used to refer to 1,000,000,000; whereas &quot;milliard&quot; is rarely used in English, variations on this name often appear in other languages.

In the Indian numbering system, it is known as 100 crore or 1 .

1,000,000,000 is also the cube of 1000.

It is a common metric used in macroeconomics when describing national economies.

==Sense of scale==
The facts below give a sense of how large 1,000,000,000 (109) is in the context of time according to current scientific evidence:

===Time===

* 109 seconds (1 gigasecond) equal 11,574 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes and 40 seconds (approximately 31.7 years, or 31 years, 8 months, 8 days).
* About 109 minutes ago, the Roman Empire was flourishing and Christianity was emerging. (109 minutes is roughly 1,901 years.)
* About 109 hours ago, modern human beings and their ancestors were living in the Stone Age (more precisely, the Middle Paleolithic). (109 hours is roughly 114,080 years.)
* About 109 days ago, &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, an ape-like creature related to an ancestor of modern humans, roamed the African savannas. (109 days is roughly years.)
* About 109 months ago, dinosaurs walked the Earth during the late Cretaceous. (109 months is roughly years.)
* About 109 years—a gigaannus—ago, the first multicellular eukaryotes appeared on Earth.
* About 109 decades ago, the thin disk of the Milky Way started to form. (109 decades is exactly years.)
* The universe is thought to be about 13.8 × 109 years old.

===Distance===
* 109 inches is , more than halfway around the world and thus sufficient to reach any point on the globe from any other point.
* 109 metres (called a gigametre) is almost three times the distance from the Earth to the Moon.
* 109 kilometres (called a terametre) is over six times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

===Area===
* A billion square inches could make a square about one half mile on a side.
* A bolt of finely woven 1000-TC bed sheet linen with a billion thread crossings would have an area of , comparable to the floor area of a motel unit.

===Volume===
* There are one billion cubic millimetres in a cubic metre, and a billion cubic metres in a cubic kilometre.
* A billion grains of table salt or granulated sugar would occupy a volume of about .
* A billion cubic inches would be a volume comparable to a large commercial building slightly larger than a typical supermarket.

===Weight===
* Any object that weighs would weigh about as much as 5,525 empty Boeing 747-400s.
* A cube of iron that weighs would be on each side.

===Products===
* As of July 2016, Apple has sold one billion iPhones. This makes the iPhone one of the most successful product lines in history, surpassing the PlayStation and the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.
* As of January 2023, Facebook has 2.963 billion users.

===Nature===
* A small mountain, slightly larger than Stone Mountain in Georgia, United States, would weigh (have a mass of) a billion tons.
* There are billions of worker ants in the largest ant colony in the world, which covers almost of the Mediterranean coast.
* In 1804, the world population was one billion.

===Count===
A is a cube; B consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube &quot;A&quot;, C consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube &quot;B&quot;; and D consists of 1000 cubes the size of cube &quot;C&quot;. Thus there are &quot;A&quot;-sized cubes in &quot;C&quot;; and 1,000,000,000 &quot;A&quot;-sized cubes in &quot;D&quot;.

<text>Zuschendorf is a village in the municipality of Pirna in the Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge district of Saxony, Germany. It was incorporated into Pirna in 1923. The place was mentioned for the first time in 1378. It lies in the valley of the river Seidewitz, 4 km southwest of Pirna town centre, on the road to Liebstadt.

In 1553, a castle was built there, where the von Carlowitz and von Bünau families lived for many years. The baroque-style church was built in 1560 and has been a part of the castle since the Thirty Years&#x27; War. During the communist years of East Germany, a notorious antique dealer occupied the castle. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the rundown castle that should have been torn down was luckily spared. The premises has been cleaned and now has an outstanding garden of hortensia, bonsai, ivy and camellia.

<text>Fernando del Paso Morante (April 1, 1935 – November 14, 2018) was a Mexican novelist, essayist and poet.

==Biography==
Del Paso was born in Mexico City and took two years in economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). He lived in London for 14 years, where he worked for the British Broadcasting Corporation and in France, where he worked for Radio France Internationale and briefly served as Consul General of Mexico.

He has been a member of El Colegio Nacional de México since 1996 and won several international awards, including the Premio Miguel de Cervantes (2015), Alfonso Reyes International Prize (2013), the FIL Literature Prize (2007) Guadalajara International Book Fair), the Rómulo Gallegos Prize (1982), the Best Novel Published in France Award (1985) for &quot;Palinurus of Mexico&quot;, the Xavier Villaurrutia Award (1966) and the Mexico Novel Award (1976).

&quot;Noticias del Imperio&quot; (1986) is an important contribution to the Latin American new historical novel. The novel, based upon the lives of Maximilian and Carlota and the French Intervention in Mexico, is called by the author a &quot;historiographic&quot; novel. This encyclopedic novel is remarkable in that, instead of trying to discover the &quot;truth&quot; about &quot;what really happened,&quot; the author presents a number of possible versions of important and controversial events.

Del Paso claimed influence from a variety of authors including Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, Erskine Caldwell, and Thomas Wolfe.

===Library and Media Center===
On May 14, 2007, the Universidad de Guadalajara paid homage to Fernando del Paso by naming the library and media center in Ocotlán, Jalisco, the &quot;Biblioteca Fernando del Paso&quot;. This library is the largest in the western region of Mexico with a collection of 120,000 volumes and a capacity for 800 simultaneous users.

<doc id="1136380" wikidata="Q3348672" url="?curid=1136380" title="Ocean Spray (cooperative)">
<text>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. is an American agricultural cooperative of cranberry growers headquartered in Plymouth County, Massachusetts. It currently has over 700 member growers (in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington, Florida, British Columbia and other parts of Canada, as well as Chile). The cooperative employs about 2,000 people, with sales of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2013 and accounts for 70% of North American cranberry production. Their products include cranberry sauce, fruit juices, fruit snacks, and dried cranberries.

The cooperative has made a number of innovations, including the first juice blend, the first juice boxes, and sweetened dried cranberries (Craisins). Its cranberry juice won the ChefsBest Award for best taste.

==History==
Ocean Spray was formed in 1930, in Hanson, Massachusetts, by three cranberry growers who wanted to expand their market for cranberries. Led by growers Marcus L. Urann, Elizabeth F. Lee and John C. Makepeace, who had created a cranberry sauce, the cooperative developed more cranberry-based products. In the same year, Ocean Spray became the first producer of cranberry juice drinks with the introduction of Cranberry Juice Cocktail. (A.D. Makepeace Company, one of the original founders of Ocean Spray, has been in continual operation since the late 19th century and is currently the world&#x27;s largest grower of cranberries.)

In 1963, executive Edward Gelsthorpe worked with Sylvia Schur to develop Cranapple juice, a product that brought the cranberry to greater popularity and increased usage to year-round, earning Gelsthorpe the nickname &quot;Cranapple Ed&quot;.

In 1976, the cooperative expanded its membership to grapefruit growers in Florida. In September 1976, the headquarters was moved from Hanson to Plymouth, Massachusetts.

In 1989, the Ocean Spray headquarters was moved to its current location of a building on the Lakeville-Middleborough town line.

In June 2004, Ocean Spray members voted down a joint venture of the cooperative&#x27;s beverage business with PepsiCo. Pepsi had offered the co-op $100 million, an assumption of debt and fixed prices for cranberry harvests. In July 2006, the cooperative signed a 25-year single-serve (machine-dispensed) juice distribution deal with Pepsi.

In September 2004, Ocean Spray agreed to purchase the processing assets of Northland Cranberry. This acquisition included a juice production facility in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.

In June 2006, at the request of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Ocean Spray agreed to end its support for animal experiments. Previously, Ocean Spray had funded tests involving infecting mice with &quot;H. pylori&quot;, bacteria that cause stomach ulcers, and then feeding them cranberry juice to see if it had any positive effect. These experiments were conducted to determine the usefulness of Ocean Spray&#x27;s cranberry juice as a digestif.
Ocean Spray completed expansion of the Wisconsin Rapids processing plant in September 2008. The addition doubles the facility size to , making it the world&#x27;s largest cranberry processing facility. The plant has numerous environmentally friendly features including a wastewater treatment facility, energy-efficient lighting, and the use of methane from the nearby Veolia Cranberry Creek Landfill for boiler fuel. With the addition, the plant will produce Craisins, in addition to currently produced juice concentrates.

Throughout 2012, Ocean Spray contributed $387,100 to a $46 million political campaign known as &quot;The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers&quot;. This organization was set up to oppose a citizen&#x27;s initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.

Ocean Spray has juice-filling facilities in Henderson, Nevada; Sulphur Springs, Texas; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and Kenosha, Wisconsin.

In January 2020, Ocean Spray settled a class-action lawsuit that claimed its products were misleading in advertising that they do not contain artificial flavors, since they contain malic acid and/or fumaric acid. The company agreed to pay $5.4 million dollars to claimants.

In February 2020, Ocean Spray dismissed its president and CEO, Bobby Chacko, for violating the company&#x27;s harassment policy.

In October 2020, Ocean Spray gained media attention when Nathan Apodaca made a TikTok video that went viral featuring the Fleetwood Mac 1977 hit &quot;Dreams&quot; while drinking a bottle of Ocean Spray and riding his skateboard.

<doc id="1136385" wikidata="Q456216" url="?curid=1136385" title="Peter G. Peterson">
<text>Peter George Peterson (June 5, 1926 – March 20, 2018) was an American investment banker who served as United States Secretary of Commerce from February 29, 1972, to February 1, 1973, under the Richard Nixon administration. Peterson was also chairman and CEO of Bell &amp; Howell from 1963 to 1971. From 1973 to 1984, he was chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers. In 1985, he co-founded the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, and served as chairman. In the same year, Peterson became chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, a position he held until his retirement in 2007, after which he was named chairman emeritus. In 2008, Peterson was ranked 149th on the &quot;&quot;Forbes&quot; 400 Richest Americans&quot; with a net worth of $2.8 billion. He was also known as founder and principal funder of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting fiscal austerity.

==Early life and education==
Peterson was born in Kearney, Nebraska, as the eldest of three children, to Venetia &quot;Venet&quot; Paul (Παύλου &quot;Pavlou&quot;) and George Peterson (Πετρόπουλος &quot;Petropoulos&quot;); both were immigrants from southern Greece. He had one younger sister, Elaine, who died of croup when she was one year old, and a brother, John, who was the youngest. His father arrived in the United States at age 17 and worked as a dishwasher for Union Pacific Railroad and roomed on a caboose. In 1923, George opened and then ran a Greek diner, Central Café, in Kearney, after changing his name from Georgios Petropoulos. Peter began working at the cash register at age 8. Expelled from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for plagiarizing a term paper in his freshman year, Peterson enrolled at Northwestern University and The Kellogg School, graduating in 1947 with highest academic honors, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. Peterson was first married from 1948 to 1950 to Kris Krengel, a journalism student at Northwestern University. He joined Market Facts upon graduation, a Chicago-based market research firm, in 1948. In 1951, he received an M.B.A. degree from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, before returning to Market Facts as an executive vice president.

==Business career==
Peterson joined advertising agency McCann Erickson in 1953, again in Chicago, where he served as a director. He joined movie-equipment maker Bell and Howell Corporation in 1958 as executive vice president. He later succeeded Charles H. Percy as chairman and CEO, positions he held from 1963 to 1971.

In 1969, he was invited by philanthropist John D. Rockefeller III, CFR chairman John J. McCloy, and former treasury secretary Douglas Dillon to chair a Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy, which became known as the Peterson Commission. Among its recommendations adopted by the government were that foundations be required annually to disburse a minimum proportion of their funds.

==United States Secretary of Commerce (1972–73)==

In 1971, he was named assistant to the president for international economic affairs by U.S. president Richard Nixon. In April 1971, Peterson produced a secret report for Nixon on the volatile world economy that argued that the U.S. was in economic decline under the existing world order of trade, which the U.S. had helped build immediately after World War II. To stem that decline, according to Peterson, the U.S. must challenge competing nations in the trading sphere by adopting industrial policy. The report impressed Nixon and the idea of American competitive decline soon became &quot;an article of popular belief&quot;. The report established some of the intellectual foundations of Nixon&#x27;s decision in August 1971 to upend the Bretton Woods agreement. Professional economists derided the thesis as a form of mercantilism that betrayed &quot;economic illiteracy&quot;.

In 1972, Peterson became Secretary of Commerce, a position he held for one year. At that time he also assumed the chairmanship of Nixon&#x27;s National Commission on Productivity and was appointed U.S. Chairman of the U.S.–Soviet Commercial Commission. During his tenure, Peterson was a strong critic of the rising financial debt of the United States.

==Post-Washington career==
Peterson was chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers (1973–1977) and Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. (1977–1984).

In 1985, Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman co-founded the private equity and investment management firm the Blackstone Group, and for many years Peterson was its chairman. At Blackstone, he made a fortune, including the $1.9 billion he received when it went public in 2007, that funded many of his charitable and political causes.

==Clinton presidency==
In 1992, he was one of the co-founders of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan citizens&#x27; organization that advocates reduction of the federal budget deficit. Following record deficits under President George W. Bush, Peterson said in 2004, &quot;I remain a Republican, but the Republicans have become a far more theological, faith-directed party, not troubling with evidence.&quot;

In February 1994, President Bill Clinton named Peterson as a member of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform co-chaired by Senators Bob Kerrey and John Danforth. He also served as co-chair of the Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprises (co-chaired by John Snow).

==Later career==
Peterson succeeded David Rockefeller as chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1985 and served until his retirement from that position in 2007. He served as trustee of the Rockefeller family&#x27;s Japan Society and of the Museum of Modern Art, and was previously on the board of Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc.

He was the founding chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (formerly the &quot;Institute for International Economics&quot;, renamed in his honor in 2006), and a trustee of the Committee for Economic Development. He was also chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York between 2000 and 2004.

In 2008, he founded the Peter G. Peterson Foundation (PGPF), an organization devoted to spreading public awareness on fiscal sustainability issues related to the national debt, federal deficits, Social Security policy, and tax policies. PGPF distributed the 2008 documentary film I.O.U.S.A. and did outreach to the 2008 presidential candidates.

Peterson funded &quot;The Fiscal Times&quot;, a news website that reports on current economic issues, including the federal budget, the deficit, entitlements, health care, personal savings, taxation, and the global economy. &quot;Fiscal Times&quot; contributors and editors include several veteran economics reporters for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

On August 4, 2010, it was announced that Peterson had signed &quot;The Giving Pledge&quot;. He was one of 40 billionaires, led by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who agreed to give at least half their wealth to charity. Most of his giving was to his own foundation, The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which focuses on raising public awareness about long-term fiscal sustainability issues.

==Political activities==
From 2007 through 2011, Peterson was reported to have contributed $458 million to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, to promote the cause of fiscal responsibility.

Peterson opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 because it cut corporate and other taxes by raising the debt. &quot;Mortgaging our fiscal future for trillions in temporary tax cuts will hurt our economy over time, and every C.E.O. should know that&quot;, he said. &quot;True business patriots need to advocate for their country as well as their company.&quot;

==Personal life==
Peterson was married three times and divorced twice. In 1953, he married former Brown University psychology professor Sally Hornbogen Peterson, a trustee of the Dalton School and a graduate of Northwestern University, with whom he had five children: John Scott Peterson, James Jim Peterson, David Peterson, Michael Alexander Peterson, and the writer Holly Peterson. They divorced in 1979. The next year, Peterson married Joan Ganz Cooney, the co-creator of the popular American educational children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

In his autobiography, Peterson recalled his business and private life and blamed himself for the failure of two of his three marriages but expressed pride for having grown close to his children.

Peterson died on March 20, 2018, at age 91, of natural causes at his Manhattan home. He is survived by his children, his wife Joan, and nine grandchildren.

==Honors==
In 1962, Peterson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In recognition of his support, the influential Peterson Institute for International Economics was named in his honor in 2006.

In 2006, Peterson was honored with the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution. The same year he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<doc id="1136387" wikidata="Q65122140" url="?curid=1136387" title="John I (archbishop of Cyprus)">
<text>John () was the archbishop of Cyprus in the late 7th century, during the temporary relocation of much of the Cypriot population, and the see of the Church of Cyprus, to Cyzicus in northwestern Asia Minor.

John was originally archbishop of Salamis on Cyprus, and hence head of the autocephalous Church of Cyprus. In 688, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II and the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik concluded a treaty that made the island a neutral condominium, not occupied by either of the two, and with revenue shared between them. 

Sometime after that, but before 691, Emperor Justinian II decided to resettle the Cypriots in the Byzantine Empire: John with his flock were moved to Artake, near Cyzicus on the shores of the Sea of Marmara. The emperor&#x27;s motive was probably to repopulate the area, which had suffered from the depredations of the Umayyads during the previous decade; Cyzicus had even been the base of the Umayyad fleet during the First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 674–678. The &quot;De administrando imperio&quot; of the 10th-century Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, on the other hand, attributes this move to the initiative of John himself, whom he has travelling in person to Constantinople for this purpose in 691. 

According to the 39th canon of the Quinisext Council of 691/92, the town, and John&#x27;s episcopal see, was renamed to &quot;Nea Ioustinianoupolis&quot; (, &quot;New City of Justinian&quot;), and John was allowed to retain the same privileges granted to the Church of Cyprus in the Council of Ephesus in 431, namely his archiepiscopal rank and autocephalous status. John thus became the metropolitan bishop of the ecclesiastical eparchy of Hellespontus, much to the displeasure of the previous incumbent, the metropolitan of Cyzicus, who was demoted to the rank of a simple bishop and subordinated to the see of &quot;Nea Ioustinianoupolis&quot;. John&#x27;s prominence is underscored by the fact that he signed the canons of the Quinisext Council, which he attended, in seventh place among all prelates participating.

The Cypriots&#x27; exile did not last long; only seven years according to Constantine VII. Most modern scholars have thus reconstructed that in 698/99, the Cypriots returned to their island after an agreement between Abd al-Malik and the Emperor Tiberios III. This marked also the end of the see of &quot;Nea Ioustinianoupolis&quot;, which disappears from the record, while Cyzicus received its previous rights as metropolitan see back.

John was possibly succeeded as archbishop by Anthimos, who probably held office .

<text>In radio and television, broadcast delay is an intentional delay when broadcasting live material, technically referred to as a deferred live. Such a delay may be to prevent mistakes or unacceptable content from being broadcast. Longer delays lasting several hours can also be introduced so that the material is aired at a later scheduled time (such as the prime time hours) to maximize viewership. Tape delays lasting several hours can also be edited down to remove filler material or to trim a broadcast to the network&#x27;s desired run time for a broadcast slot, but this is not always the case.

==Usage==
A short delay is often used to prevent profanity, bloopers, nudity, or other undesirable material from making it to air. In this instance, it is often referred to as a &quot;seven-second delay&quot; or &quot;profanity delay&quot;. Longer delays, however, may also be introduced, often to allow a show to air at the same time for the local market as is sometimes done with nationally broadcast programs in countries with multiple time zones. Considered as time shifting, that is often achieved by a &quot;tape delay&quot;, using a video tape recorder, modern digital video recorders, or other similar technology.

Tape delay may also refer to the process of broadcasting an event at a later scheduled time because a scheduling conflict prevents a live telecast, or a broadcaster seeks to maximize ratings by airing an event in a certain timeslot. That can also be done because of time constraints of certain portions, usually those that do not affect the outcome of the show, are edited out, or the availability of hosts or other key production staff only at certain times of the day, and it is generally applicable for cable television programs.

In countries that span multiple time zones and have influential domestic eastern regions, such as Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the United States, television networks usually delay the entirety of their schedule for stations in the west, so prime time programming can be time shifted to air in local primetime hours to improve accessibility and viewership. Although Mexico and Canada have now regularly televised their live programs in real time simultaneously across all of their territories, in the U.S., &quot;east&quot; feeds usually target the Eastern and Central time zones, while &quot;west&quot; feeds are usually oriented towards the Pacific time zone. As a result, until today, many live programs, such as music and talent competition shows, are usually tape delayed for the western half of the country and aired as-live (although they may include edits to streamline the broadcast or resolve technical faults). Australian network television schedule is largely patterned from the U.S. format.

In countries that span multiple time zones and are the most populous in their western or central regions, like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, all television schedules nationwide are simultaneous with their broadcast sources, enabling full nationwide live telecasts regardless of time zones (although Russia conducts separate live primetime newscast versions for each range of time zones in that country). The continents of Europe and Africa, which both fall in the same range of time zones, are receptive to each other&#x27;s live telecasts, while most of Asia from India eastwards, which includes China alongside the most populous time zone in the world, also receive simultaneous live telecasts within those cluster of regions. 

International tape delays of live global events, intended by major television networks, dominated world television until the early 2010s. For example, during the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and the Beijing Olympics in 2008, daytime events were occurring at early morning hours in the Americas, Africa, and Europe but were aired in the afternoon and evening hours live entirely in Asia, Australia, and Oceania. That made some broadcasters show high-profile events twice (live and then rebroadcast during prime time), but others withheld the same event to be broadcast solely during prime time. Often, tape-delaying of those events would mean editing them down for time considerations, highlighting what the broadcaster feels are the most interesting portions of the event, or advertising, resulting in reduced desired TV coverage for the given multiple sporting events.

However, since many live events became available via social media in the late 2000s, tape delays have become increasingly irrelevant because of live television&#x27;s resurgence as a broadcast format. Since the mid-2010s, several high-profile entertainment programs with huge live global audiences like the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Grammy Awards, Emmy Awards and Tony Awards, yearly specials like the Miss Universe and Miss World pageants, and major sporting events like the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup and the National Football League&#x27;s Super Bowl, air to totality live on both television and the internet virtually all across the world&#x27;s time zones in and out of their countries of origin. In addition, television networks nowadays mandate prime time rebroadcasts (featuring edits as desired by broadcasters) for regions that are not covered by the original live primetime broadcasting and previously and solely relied on delayed telecasts on prime time among these otherwise live events.

In certain professional competitions, like chess, broadcast delays may be used to prevent cheating or other irregularities.

==History==
The radio station WKAP in Allentown, Pennsylvania, introduced a tape delay system consisting of an external playback head, which was spaced far enough away from the record head to produce a six-second delay. A system of rollers guided the tape over the playback head before it wound up on the take up reel. This system was introduced in 1952, when WKAP started a talk show called &quot;Open Mic&quot;. It is believed that this was the first time a telephone call-in show was broadcast with the telephone conversation &quot;live&quot; on the air. The FCC rules at the time prohibited the broadcasting of a live telephone conversation. However, there was no rule prohibiting a taped playback of a telephone call, provided that a &quot;beep&quot; tone was heard by the caller every 15 seconds so that the caller knew he was being recorded. The six-second delay constituted a &quot;taped&quot; telephone conversation, thus complying with FCC regulations.

The broadcast profanity delay was invented by C. Frank Cordaro (July 13, 1919 – February 20, 1997), who was Chief Engineer of WKAP during the 1950s and early 1960s. Ogden Davies, then-General Manager of WKAP, assigned Cordaro the task of developing a device whereby profanity during a &quot;live&quot; conversation could be deleted by the radio talk show host before it was broadcast. This new device was to be used on the &quot;Open Mic&quot; radio talk show. The device Cordaro developed was the first tape delay system. WKAP was one of several stations owned by the Rahal brothers of West Virginia (later Rahal Communications). First tested and used at WKAP, this tape system for broadcast profanity delay was then installed at the other Rahal-owned radio stations. From the Rahal brothers&#x27; stations, the broadcast profanity delay went into common usage throughout the US.

John Nebel, who began a pioneering radio talk show in New York City in 1954, was one of the early users of a tape delay system that was invented by his engineer, Russell Tinklepaugh. Another announcer who was said to use a tape-delay was talk show pioneer Jerry Williams at WMEX in Boston in the late 1950s.

==Computerized delay==

In 1977, the capacity of RAM (random-access memory) had reached 16 kilobits per chip, enough to think about using computerized digital audio means to create a sufficient delay for content deletion. By storing audio digitally, it was possible to move a &quot;virtual tape head&quot; along recorded audio. Eventide, Inc. created the first digital broadcast delay for this purpose. The device (known colloquially as a &quot;dump box&quot;) had a large &quot;DUMP&quot;/&quot;DELAY DUMP&quot; button that would bring the delay to zero, thus removing unwanted segments. In addition to this convenience, it would also &quot;rebuild&quot; the delay time by unnoticeably lengthening the normal pauses in spoken material. Thus, a minute or so later, the broadcaster would again have full delay, often leaving the listener unaware that material had been deleted.

In modern systems, a profanity delay can be a software module manually operated by a broadcast technician that puts a short delay (usually, 30 seconds) into the broadcast of live content. This gives the broadcaster time to censor the audio (and video) feed. This can be accomplished by cutting directly to a non-delayed feed, essentially jumping past the undesired moment (something that can be quite jarring to a viewer or listener). In other cases, dedicated hardware units similar to the original digital unit but with improved quality and editing capability can be used. These products can even &quot;build up&quot; delay with difficult program material such as music. Alternatively, a bleep noise or other substitute sound can be inserted. This is more difficult to do with live content, however, and more often appears on recorded material.

<doc id="1136404" wikidata="Q779384" url="?curid=1136404" title="Final-obstruent devoicing">
<text>Final-obstruent devoicing or terminal devoicing is a systematic phonological process occurring in languages such as Catalan, German, Dutch, Quebec French, Breton, Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, Turkish, and Wolof. In such languages, voiced obstruents in final position (at the end of a word) become voiceless before voiceless consonants and in pausa. The process can be written as *C[+ obstruent, +voice] → C[-voice]/__#.

==Languages with final-obstruent devoicing==
===Germanic languages===
Most modern continental West Germanic languages developed final devoicing, the earliest evidence appearing in Old Dutch around the 9th or 10th century.

* Afrikaans
* Central Franconian (Luxembourgish and Ripuarian)
* Dutch, also Old and Middle Dutch
* (High) German, also Middle High German
* Gothic (for fricatives)
* Limburgish
* Low German, also Middle Low German
* Old English (for fricatives, inconsistently for )
* West Frisian. In contrast, North Frisian (and some Low German dialects in North Frisia influenced by it) do not have final devoicing.
* East Frisian

In contrast to other continental West Germanic languages, (Eastern)-Yiddish notably does not alter final voiced sounds; this appears to be a later reversal, most probably under Slavic influence. In its earliest recorded example (Yiddish, written evidence), it has final-obstruent devoicing (טַק &quot;tak&quot; instead of &quot;tag&quot; for day.) 

North Germanic languages generally lack devoicing. Norwegian and Swedish do not have final devoicing, and Danish does not even have voiced obstruents that could be devoiced. As in Danish, Icelandic stops are voiceless, but it has voiced fricatives which may also occur word-finally.

Gothic (an East Germanic language) also developed final devoicing independently, but only for fricatives.

===Romance languages===
Among the Romance languages, word-final devoicing is common in the Gallo-Romance languages, some of which tend to exhibit strong Frankish influence (itself the ancestor of Old Dutch, above).
* Catalan
* Old French and Middle French. Preserved in certain Modern French inflections such as vs. , when applying liaison vs. , but now often regularized. However, dialects maintain word-final devoicing:
** Canadian French
** Meridional French, influenced by Catalan and Occitan
* Friulian
* Lombard
* Occitan
* Romansh
* Walloon

Notes:

* Many Romance languages (such as Italian) rarely have words with final voiced consonants for different reasons in their phonological histories, but borrowings from other languages that have a voiced final consonant (like &quot;weekend&quot;) are not devoiced.

* Portuguese merges and in word-final position ( and are homophones) but has a few words ending with voiced stops like . However, some dialects add an epethentic vowel after word-final voiced stops.

===Slavic languages===
Most Slavic languages exhibit final devoicing, but notably standard (Štokavian) Serbo-Croatian and Ukrainian do not.
* Belarusian
* Bulgarian
* Czech
* Macedonian
* Polish
* Russian
* Rusyn
* Serbo-Croatian (Kajkavian dialects)
* Slovak
* Slovene
* Sorbian

===Other Indo-European languages===
* Albanian – certain dialects, notably the dialects of certain areas of the Berat and Korçë counties, towards the southeast of Albania
* Arbëresh
* Breton
* Latgalian
* Lithuanian
* Yaghnobi

===Non-Indo-European languages===
* Azerbaijani (half-voiced in Iranian Azerbaijan)
* Georgian (for stops)
* Indonesian (for stops)
* Kalmyk (for stops)
* Khmer
* Korean (nuanced; see Korean phonology)
* Livonian (fully devoiced or half-voiced)
* Lao
* Malaysian (for stops)
* Maltese
* Modern Javanese (for stops)
* Mongolian
* Thai
* Tok Pisin
* Turkish (for stops, partially)

Notes:
* Hungarian, a Uralic language which lies geographically between Germanic- and Slavic- speaking areas, does &quot;not&quot; have it.

==Examples==
===Dutch and Afrikaans===
In Dutch and Afrikaans, terminal devoicing results in homophones such as &#x27;hard&#x27; and &#x27;heart&#x27; as well as differences in consonant sounds between the singular and plural forms of nouns, for example (Dutch) and (Afrikaans) for &#x27;wave–waves&#x27;.

The history of the devoicing phenomenon within the West Germanic languages is not entirely clear, but the discovery of a runic inscription from the early fifth century suggests that this terminal devoicing originated in Frankish. Of the old West Germanic languages, Old Dutch, a descendant of Frankish, is the earliest to show any kind of devoicing, and final devoicing also occurred in Frankish-influenced Old French.

Amelands, spoken on the Wadden Sea island of Ameland, is the only Dutch dialect that does not feature final-obstruent devoicing.

===English===
Standard varieties of English do not have phonological final-obstruent devoicing of the type that neutralizes phonemic contrasts; thus pairs like &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;bat&quot; are distinct in all major accents of English. Nevertheless, voiced obstruents are devoiced to some extent in final position in English, especially when phrase-final or when followed by a voiceless consonant (for example, &quot;bad cat&quot; ). Additionally, the voiced alveolar stop /d/ is regularly devoiced in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE).

Old English had final devoicing of , although the spelling did not distinguish and . It can be inferred from the modern pronunciation of &quot;half&quot; with a voiceless , from an originally voiced fricative in Proto-Germanic (preserved in German and Gothic ). There was also final devoicing of to finally, evidenced by spellings like alongside .

===German===
Final-obstruents devoicing occurs in the varieties from Northern Germany. The German contrast between homorganic obstruents is more properly described as a fortis and lenis opposition than an opposition of voiceless and voiced sounds. Therefore, the term &quot;devoicing&quot; may be misleading, since voice is only an optional feature of German lenis obstruents. By contrast, the German term for the phenomenon, &quot;Auslautverhärtung&quot; (&quot;final-sound hardening&quot;), refers to fortition rather than devoicing. However, the German phenomenon is similar to the final devoicing in other languages in that the opposition between two different kinds of obstruents disappears at the ends of words, and in fact at the ends of all syllables, making homophones of such pairs as (&quot;wheel&quot;) and (&quot;council, counsel&quot;), both pronounced . The German varieties of the north, and many pronunciations of Standard German, involve voice in the distinction between fortis and lenis obstruents however. Final devoicing applies to all plosives, affricates and fricatives, and to loan words as well as native words.

Some examples from Northern German include:
===Russian===
Final-obstruent devoicing can lead to the neutralization of phonemic contrasts in certain environments. For example, Russian (&#x27;demon&#x27;, phonemically ) and (&#x27;without&#x27;, phonemically ) are pronounced identically in isolation as .

The presence of this process in Russian is also the source of the seemingly variant transliterations of Russian names into &quot;-off&quot; (Russian: ), especially by the French, as well as older English transcriptions.

==Devoicing in compounds==
In compounds, the behaviour varies between languages:
* In some languages, devoicing is lexicalized, which means that words that are devoiced in isolation retain that final devoicing when they are part of a compound. In English, for example, there is an alternation between voiced and voiceless fricatives in pairs such as the following:
** thief ([f]) – thieve ([v])
** bath ([θ]) – bathe ([ð]) 

The process is not productive in English, however; see article Consonant voicing and devoicing.
* In other languages, it is purely phonological, which means that voicing depends solely on position and on assimilation with adjacent consonants. Example: German.

<text>A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, is the enclosure that contains most of the hardware of a personal computer. The components housed inside the case (such as the CPU, motherboard, memory, mass storage devices, power supply unit and various expansion cards) are referred as the &quot;internal&quot; hardware, while hardware outside the case (typically cable-linked or plug-and-play devices such as the display, speakers, keyboard, mouse and USB flash drives) are known as &quot;peripherals&quot;.

Conventional computer cases are fully enclosed, with small holes (mostly in the back panel) that allow ventilation and cutout openings that provide access to plugs/sockets (back) and removable media drive bays (front). The structural frame (chassis) of a case is usually constructed from rigid metals such as steel (often SECC — steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil) and aluminium alloy, with hardpoints and through holes for mounting internal hardware, case fans/coolers and for organizing cable management. The external case panels, at least one of which are removable, cover the chassis from the front, sides and top to shield the internal components from physical intrusion and dust collection, and are typically made from painted metallic and/or plastic material, while other materials such as mesh, tempered glass, acrylic, wood and even Lego bricks have appeared in many modern commercial or home-built cases. In recent years, &quot;open frame&quot; or &quot;open air&quot; cases that are only partly enclosed (with freer ventilation and thus theoretically better cooling) have become available in the premium gaming PC market.

==Sizes and terminology==


Cases can come in many different sizes and shapes, which are usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard since it is physically the largest hardware component in most computers. Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only the &quot;internal&quot; dimensions and layout of the case. Form factors for rack-mounted and blade servers may include precise &quot;external&quot; dimensions as well since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures.

For example, a case designed for an ATX motherboard and power supply unit (PSU) may take on several external forms such as a vertical &quot;tower&quot; (designed to sit on the floor, height &gt; width), a flat &quot;desktop&quot; (height &lt; width) or &quot;pizza box&quot; (height ≤ ) designed to sit on the desk under the computer&#x27;s monitor). Full-size tower cases are typically larger in volume than desktop cases, with more room for drive bays, expansion slots, and custom or all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions. Desktop cases—and &quot;mini-tower&quot; cases under about high—are popular in business environments where space is at a premium.

Currently, the most popular form factor for desktop computers is ATX, although microATX and small form factors have also become very popular for a variety of uses. In the high-end segment, the unofficial and loosely defined XL-ATX specification appeared around 2009. It extends the length of the mainboard to accommodate four graphics cards with dual-slot coolers. Some XL-ATX mainboards increase the mainboard&#x27;s width as well, to allow more space for the CPU, Memory PWM, and in some cases, a second CPU socket. While the market share of these exotic high-end mainboards is very low, almost all high-end cases and many mainstream cases support XL-ATX (10 expansion slots). As of 2018, no major motherboard manufacturer has made an XL-ATX board for several years. E-ATX is similar to XL-ATX in that it is larger than ATX and is also loosely defined. Unlike XL-ATX, E-ATX motherboards and cases are still in production (as of 2020), and support quad-channel memory across 8 slots of ram, up to 4 PCI-e expansion slots for up to 4 double slot graphics cards and a single CPU such as the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X. Companies like In Win Development, Shuttle Inc. and AOpen originally popularized small cases, for which FlexATX was the most common motherboard size. As of 2010 Mini ITX has widely replaced FlexATX as the most common small form factor mainboard standard. The latest mini ITX mainboards from Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, ASRock, Zotac and Foxconn offer the same feature set as full size mainboards. High-end mini ITX mainboards support standard desktop CPUs, use standard memory DIMM sockets, and mostly feature a full-size PCI-E 16× slot with support for the fastest graphics cards, although some instead use a PCI, or PCIe slot of fewer than 16 lanes. This allows customers to build a fully-fledged high-end computer in a significantly smaller case. Apple Inc. has also produced the Mac Mini computer, which is similar in size to a standard CD-ROM drive, and many manufacturers offer mini-ITX cases of similar size for low-wattage CPUs with integrated graphics.

Tower cases are often categorized as mini-tower, midi-tower, mid-tower, or full-tower. The terms are subjective and inconsistently defined by different manufacturers.

&quot;Full tower cases&quot; are typically or more in height and intended to stand on the floor. They can have anywhere from six to ten externally accessible drive bays. These cases were originally developed to house file servers which would typically be tasked with serving data from expensive CD-ROM databases that held more data than the hard drives commonly available at the time. Hence, many full tower cases include locking doors and other physical security features to prevent theft of the discs. However, as computing technology moves from floppy disks and CD-ROMs to large capacity hard drives, USB flash drives, and network-based solutions, more recent full tower cases typically only have none, one, or two external bays for CD drives, with the internal bays moved elsewhere in the case to improve airflow. Today, full tower cases are commonly used by enthusiasts as showpiece display cases with custom water cooling, lighting, and tempered glass (replacing acrylic). They may also hold two computers (as is the case with the Corsair 1000D) and dual power supplies (Corsair 900D).

&quot;Mid-tower cases&quot; are smaller, about high with two to four external bays. They may also hold two computers.

A &quot;mini-tower&quot; case will typically have only one or two external bays.

The marketing term &quot;midi-tower&quot; sometimes refers to cases smaller than mid-tower but larger than mini-tower, typically with two to three external bays. Other times the term may be synonymous with &quot;mid-tower&quot;.

==Layout==
Computer cases usually include sheet metal enclosures for a power supply unit and drive bays, as well as a rear panel that can accommodate peripheral connectors protruding from the motherboard and expansion slots. Most cases also have a power button or switch, a reset button, and LEDs to indicate power, hard drive activity, and network activity in some models. Some cases include built-in I/O ports (such as USB and headphone ports) on the front of the case. Such a case will also (normally) include the wires needed to connect these ports, switches, and indicators to the motherboard.

===Major component locations===
* The motherboard is usually screwed to the case along its largest face, which could be the bottom or the side of the case depending on its form factor and orientation.
* Form factors such as ATX provide a back panel with cut-out holes to expose I/O ports provided by integrated peripherals, as well as expansion slots which may optionally expose additional ports provided by expansion cards. Many larger ATX cases can also be used with motherboards of other form factors.
* The power supply unit mounting point differs from case to case, but the most commonly used locations (both at the rear of the case) and their advantages/disadvantages are:
**The top of the case, usually allowing the PSU&#x27;s built-in fan to act as an auxiliary exhaust fan but causes the PSU to be fed air heated by the internal components of the case, thus causing PSU efficiency and lifespan degradation.
**The bottom of the case, with an (often filtered) vent in the bottom of the case allowing the PSU to draw cool air from the outside.
*Regardless of the mounting position, the PSU will usually be attached to the case with four screws to support its weight.
* Most cases include drive bays on the front of the case; a typical ATX case includes 5.25&quot;, 3.5&quot; and 2.5&quot; bays. In modern computers, the 5.25&quot; bays are used for optical drives, the 3.5&quot; bays are used for hard drives and card readers, and the 2.5&quot; bays are used for solid-state drives.
* Buttons and LEDs are typically located on the front of the case; some cases include additional I/O ports, temperature, and processor speed monitors in the same area.
* Vents are often found on the front, back, top, left side panel, and sometimes on the right-side panel of the case. Regardless of their placement, their purpose is either to let cool air into the case or to let hot air out. Larger vents usually allow cooling fans to be mounted via surrounding threaded screw holes. Newer cases include mountings for larger 120 mm or 140 mm cooling fans for quieter operation than the 80 mm fans formerly common.
* An I/O template, or I/O plate, fits around the motherboard&#x27;s back panel of external ports. Sometimes provided by the case manufacturer, it is often replaced by the one that comes with the motherboard.

===Internal access===
Accessing the interior components of a modern ATX tower case is done by removing the side panels. Looking front-to-back, accessing the motherboard, PSU, drive bays, and most case fan installation points are done by removing the left side panel.
Removing the right-side panel is done less often to access the space behind the motherboard mounting plate. This space is devoted to cable management, as cables routed in front of the motherboard may disrupt the flow of air within the case causing increased temperatures. BTX, an uncontemporary standard, has the main side panel on the right side as opposed to the left. Some upside-down designed ATX cases are also accessed by removing the right-side panel door.

Alternatively, the case may have a single large U-shaped cover that saddles the chassis. This was ubiquitous in AT tower cases.

To prevent the buildup of performance-degrading dust within the case, many models feature dust filters in front of the air intake fans. While the exact method of accessing the front filters depends on the case model, it usually requires the removal of the entire front panel. Removal of the front panel itself may or may not require the removal of one or both of the side panels. If there is any doubt, consult the user&#x27;s manual if possible.

Traditionally, most computer cases required computer case screws to hold components and panels in place (i.e. motherboard, PSU, drives, and expansion cards). From the early 2000s onwards there is a trend towards tool-less cases, in which components are held together with snap-in plastic rails, thumbscrews, and other methods that do not require tools; this facilitates quick assembly and modification of computer hardware and is also cheaper to manufacture.

==Appearance==

Throughout the 1990s, most computer cases had simple rectangular shapes, and were often painted beige or white with little attention given to the visual design. Beige box designs are still found on a large number of budget computers assembled from generic components. These class of machines are now known as white box computers, even though the cases for these types of machines are now generally colored black or silver instead of beige. More modern computer cases include a much wider range of variation in shape, color, form factor, and materials, such as brushed aluminium and/or tempered glass which are offered with more expensive cases.

&quot;Case modding&quot; is the artistic styling of computer cases, often to draw attention to the use of advanced or unusual components. Since the early 2000s, some cases have included clear side panels or acrylic windows so that users can look inside while it is operating. Modded cases may also include colored internal lighting, custom paint, or liquid cooling systems. Some hobbyists build custom cases from raw materials like aluminum, steel, styrofoam, acrylic, or wood.

Historically, cases used CCFL lighting and eventually single color LEDs as strips or in fans to illuminate their interior; modern cases use RGB LED lighting instead, often incorporated into case fans. To improve airflow while allowing RGB fans to be visible, many cases as of 2020 use metal meshes, without any external bays. Many include a PSU shroud and vertical gpu mounts. Some used to include holes to support external water cooling radiators. Cases with side windows may have side fans (on the window) as well, although it is uncommon for cases with glass windows to have side fans.

===Case manufacturers===

Prominent after-market case manufacturers include Antec, BitFenix, Cooler Master, Corsair, Fractal Design, In Win Development, Lian Li, NZXT Corp., Phanteks, Rosewill, and Thermaltake, (DIY PC)

==Intrusion detection==
Some computer cases include a biased switch (push-button) which connects to the motherboard. When the case is opened, the switch position changes, and the system records this change. The system&#x27;s firmware or BIOS may be configured to report this event the next time it is powered on. This physical intrusion detection system may help computer owners detect tampering with their computers. However, most such systems are quite simple in construction; a knowledgeable intruder can open the case or modify its contents without triggering the switch.

In the past, many tower cases (including full tower cases) intended to house file servers featured a locking door covering the external drive bays. This was a security feature intended to prevent the theft of the CD-ROM discs the drives would be holding. At the time, CD-ROM capacity was larger than the hard disks available, and many business-critical databases were distributed on this media. These databases were often very expensive or held proprietary data, and hence would be likely targets for casual theft.

==Story summaries==

===Bon Voyage, Mr. President===
An overthrown Latin American president, Mr. President, is exiled to Martinique. The 73-year-old man develops a peculiar pain in his ribs, lower abdomen, and groin. He travels to Geneva, Switzerland in search of a diagnosis. After extensive medical testing, he is informed that the problem resides in his spine. A risky operation is recommended to relieve the pain. The President meets a fellow countryman, Homero Rey, who works as an ambulance driver at the hospital. Homero schemes to sell an insurance plan and funeral package to the sick man, but the President is no longer wealthy and lives frugally. He is reduced to selling his dead wife&#x27;s jewelry and other trinkets to pay the cost of his medical expenses and operation. Homero and his wife, Lázara, grow fond of Mr. President. They provide financial assistance and care for him after he is discharged from the hospital. The President returns to Martinique. His pain is unimproved but no worse either. He resumes many of his bad habits and considers going back to the country he once ruled, only this time as the head of a reform group.

===The Saint===
The story is centered on a character named Margarito Duarte and takes place in Rome. Margarito is originally from a small Andean village in Tolima, Colombia but travels to Rome in order to begin the process of having his deceased daughter recognized as a saint. Margarito lost his wife shortly after the birth of their only daughter and she died soon after at the age of seven from an essential fever. Eleven years after her death the villagers are forced to move their loved ones from the cemetery to another location as the space is needed for a new dam. When his daughter is unearthed she is found to be still intact and completely weightless. The villagers decide that she is a saint and pool funds to send Margarito with his daughter&#x27;s body to Rome. There he meets the narrator at the &quot;pensione&quot; where they are both staying. Nothing seems to come from his inexhaustible attempts to canonize his daughter and he eventually loses contact with the narrator and other characters of the story. However, twenty-two years later, and after the death of four popes, Margarito and the narrator meet again by chance and the narrator finds that Margarito is still waiting for his daughter&#x27;s recognition as a saint. It is then that the narrator realizes that the true saint of the story is really Margarito. The narrator states, &quot;Without realizing it, by means of his daughter&#x27;s incorruptible body and while he was still alive, he had spent twenty-two years fighting for the legitimate cause of his own canonization.&quot;

===The Airplane of the Sleeping Beauty===
A man reflects on a peculiar flight experience from Paris to New York. Seated next to a beautiful woman who remains asleep throughout the entire flight, he becomes increasingly fascinated with her and the situation. The narrator imagines the woman as an almost unreachable object of desire, akin to Sleeping Beauty. As the flight continues, he contemplates the nature of his obsession with her slumber and the possible parallels to the voyeuristic tendencies of others. After an eventful night, he reflects on how life can pass by unnoticed, and when the woman finally wakes, she acts indifferent, leaving him with a sense of disappointment and realization about the fleeting nature of these connections. &quot;The Airplane of the Sleeping Beauty&quot; recounts García Márquez&#x27;s personal impressions, when he fell in love with a woman in a Parisian airport at the first sight. By coincidence, she happened to be his neighbor on the plane he was taking later.

===I Sell My Dreams===
One day, while the narrator was having breakfast in the morning at the Havana Riviera Hotel, a gigantic wave crashed down (&quot;like an explosion of dynamite&quot;) on the shore, picking up and overturning several cars. Under one of smashed cars was found a woman wearing &quot;a gold ring shaped like a serpent, with emerald eyes&quot;. Her eyes and ring reminded the narrator of &quot;an unforgettable woman&quot;, who used to wear &quot;a similar ring on her right forefinger&quot;, whom he met thirty-four years earlier in Vienna, which was an old imperial city back then. When she was asked &quot;how had she come to be in a world so distant and different from the windy cliffs of Quindio&quot;, she answered &quot;I sell my dreams.&quot; Born third of eleven children born to a prosperous shopkeeper in old Caldas, selling dreams was her only trade. In her childhood her dreams began to show oracular qualities, and she turned them into a source of earnings. One night, she told the narrator to leave Vienna. Considering her conviction real, the narrator boarded the last train to Rome that same night and &quot;considered himself a survivor of some catastrophe&quot;. Later the narrator happened to meet Pablo Neruda and they found that woman; by then the woman earned affluence by selling dreams. They spent time together for some days. One day Neruda &quot;dreamed about that woman who dream(ed)&quot;s. Later after Neruda &quot;took his leave&quot;, the narrator met the woman and she said &quot;I dreamed he (Neruda) was dreaming about me.&quot; After that day, the narrator never met her again. After the Havana Riviera disaster, the narrator met the Portuguese ambassador with whom that woman wearing a snake ring come and he asked him &quot;what did she do?&quot; He (the ambassador) answered with a certain disenchantment &quot;Nothing,&quot; &quot;she dreamed.&quot;

===I Only Came To Use The Phone===
A woman&#x27;s car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and she tries to seek help at a nearby building, which she believes is a place to use the phone. She unknowingly hitches a ride on a bus on its way to a mental institute. Despite her protests and attempts to explain her situation, the staff refuses to release her, insisting she becomes a patient. Her husband, referring to their trouble-ridden history, believes she has run off with another man. When she finally finds an opportunity to call him, he curses her and hangs up. She is forced to sleep with a guard to pass along the full message to her husband. When he arrives, he takes the doctor&#x27;s account to heart and leaves the woman at the hospital, where she eventually adopts the role of insanity imposed upon her by the medical staff. 

===The Ghosts of August===
A family vacationing in Tuscany decides to spend the night in a castle owned by a friend. The builder of the castle, Ludovico, a renaissance nobleman, killed his bride in bed, before setting his dogs upon himself. The family, disregarding this as a ghost tale, goes to sleep in a creepy guest room, only to awake in the bedchamber of Ludovico, with fresh blood on the sheets and a scent of fresh strawberries in the air.

===María dos Prazeres===
Maria dos Prazeres has recently had a vision of death at the age of seventy-six and wants to make all preparations before her death. She has picked out a plot for her burial on the hill cemetery, Montjuich. She meticulously trains her dog Noi to travel to the cemetery and to be able to pick out her grave on the vast hill so that he can visit and shed tears there every Sunday. She also makes sure her grave stone is nameless, like other anarchists chose under in Francoist Spain. She also held a long-standing relationship with the Count of Cardona, a man who worked under Francisco Franco, but the relationship was cut off because it had become stale. One rainy day in November, she gets a ride from the cemetery back home and she finds that she had made an error in interpreting her vision.

===Seventeen Poisoned Englishmen===
Prudencia Linero, a grieving widow, travels to Naples, Italy, after the death of her husband. She is motivated by a deep desire to see the Pope, believing it will help her find solace. However, her journey is marked by cultural shocks and disappointment. The chaotic and indifferent atmosphere of Naples contrasts starkly with her expectations of the solemnity associated with the Pope&#x27;s presence. During her stay, she becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the city’s indifference to violence and decay. She encounters grotesque sights, including the titular &quot;seventeen poisoned Englishmen,&quot; which symbolizes the absurdity and indifference she perceives in her surroundings. Despite her efforts, Prudencia&#x27;s pilgrimage leaves her feeling disillusioned, highlighting themes of grief, cultural disconnection, and the struggle to find meaning amidst loss.

===Tramontana===
The narrator describes his family&#x27;s journey through a village where the locals are inexplicably terrified of the tramontana, a cold, northern wind that sweeps through the area. The wind is portrayed as a mysterious and almost supernatural force that seems to control the villagers&#x27; behavior. They react to its presence with anxiety, fear, and a sense of inevitability, leading the narrator to explore the strange grip it holds over them. The story touches on themes of superstition, the unknown, and the irrational fear that something beyond human control can impose itself on daily life. The narrator&#x27;s observations reveal the intense psychological and emotional effects that the wind has on the community, even though the wind itself is a natural phenomenon.

===Miss Forbes&#x27;s Summer of Happiness===
While their parents are away two young boys have the serenity of a peaceful summer holiday ruined by the intervention of a strict German nanny. The nanny named Miss Forbes treats the boys terribly making them stay locked in the house and eat the most disgusting of foods, while she is free to roam as she pleases and indulges herself in delicious meals. The boys poison her wine in an attempt to kill her. After they believe she is dead they go off to play. When they come back they find their house surrounded by police and investigators because the body of Miss Forbes was found dead, not by poison, but from multiple stab wounds on her body.

===Light is Like Water===
Two young boys, Toto and Joel, live in Madrid with their parents. They ask for a boat in return for their good grades, even though their apartment is far from any water. When their parents finally buy them the rowboat, they break the light bulbs in their home and the light comes flowing out like water. They use the light to navigate around their home every Wednesday, and invite their friends to go sailing with them as well. The boys&#x27; friends end up drowning in the light.

===The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow===
Billy Sanchez and Nena Daconte, children of two wealthy Colombian families, fly to Europe to celebrate their honeymoon. Although just married, Nena is already two months pregnant. After she scrapes her ring finger on a rose thorn, the nearly imperceptible cut starts bleeding profusely. Nena is admitted to the intensive care unit of a Paris hospital. Visitation is permitted only one day a week so, Billy must wait six days before he can see his wife again.

<text>The Cretan Gendarmerie () was a gendarmerie force created under the Cretan State, after the island of Crete gained autonomy from Ottoman rule in the late 19th century. It later played a major role in the coup that toppled the government of King Constantine in 1916, and also in the World War II Battle of Crete and the Greek Resistance that followed.

==The police in Crete before autonomy==
During the second half of the 19th century the Christian Cretans revolted almost every decade against Ottoman rule. In 1878, in an agreement known as the Pact of Halepa, the Sultan Abdul Hamid II, agreed that in future Crete would be policed by native-born Cretans, Christian and Muslim. It was agreed that a new body of Gendarmerie would be formed and recruited only from Cretans.

In 1889, however, there was a breakdown of law and order on the island which gave the Sultan the chance to land large numbers of troops on the island and to ignore the undertakings contained in the Pact of Halepa, although he never formally renounced it. The Sultan appointed Colonel Tahsin as chief of police in Crete at the head of a body of two hundred men recruited in Macedonia. In 1896, law and order again broke down in Crete and a final Christian insurrection against Ottoman rule took place. Under pressure from foreign powers, Abdul Hamid agreed to the creation of a body of one hundred Montenegrin constables under the command of the British Major Bor. These men remained on the island until February 1899 and were generally regarded as an effective force, although their numbers were not proportionate to the problems of the island. In 1898, the Muslim population of Heraklion, who had been enduring intolerable conditions for nearly two years, revolted against the British force there and killed eighteen British soldiers and several hundred Cretan Christians. This led directly to the end of Ottoman rule on the island as Britain and other Great Powers tried to force the Turkish authorities to withdraw from the island by the middle of November 1898. Prince George of Greece, the second son of the King of Greece, arrived on 21 December 1898 as High Commissioner appointed by the Great Powers to rule Crete, which was now &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous, although under Ottoman suzerainty. The Prince replaced one of the earliest examples of international rule in European history. After the collapse of Ottoman rule in much of the island in February 1897, a committee of admirals of four of the Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and Italy) had run the coastal sections and immediate hinterland of the island. The British administered the prefecture of Heraklion, the Russians the prefecture of Rethymno, the French the prefecture of Lasithi and Sitia, and the Italians the prefectures of Chania and Sfakia.

The public safety situation on the island was far from ideal. Normal law and order had disappeared with the collapse of Ottoman administration and almost all adult males were armed, and apart from the national problems there were also personal feuds and endemic problems, such as cattle stealing and vendettas. Many people abandoned the countryside and flocked to the cities for protection. The foreign governors were forced to organize units of gendarmerie from Cretans to supplement their own police and military forces, and a separate force was formed in each prefecture. Naturally, the organization and system of operation of every one of these units was different and reflected the national origins of the governor. As a result, Crete was policed by four independent units of Gendarmerie, which were organised on completely different models.

==The foundation and organization of the Cretan Gendarmerie==

When Prince George of Greece undertook his duties as High Commissioner, one of his fundamental objectives was to restore law and order. He wanted to prove to everyone that Cretans were worthy of autonomy. So it was decided that all residents should be disarmed and a central body of Gendarmerie should be created. The core of the new Cretan Gendarmerie were the small units that the powers had created.

In January 1899 the Prince called the commanders of the four Gendarmerie units to Chania to hear their proposals on the way the Cretan Gendarmerie should be organized. At this meeting it was realized that the only commander who was expert and had serious proposals on the subject was the Italian representative. Thus, the Italian proposal was accepted and it was decided on the organization of a unit of gendarmerie similar to the Italian Carabinieri, which was considered one of the best such units in Europe.

In the summer of 1899, Carabinieri Captain Federico Craveri was named commander and organizer of the new Cretan Gendarmerie. Craveri, with the help of a team of 140 Carabinieri officers and non-commissioned officers, undertook the organization of the new force, using as a core the personnel of the four forces created by the international governors. In the achievement of this objective he was helped by two particularly favourable factors.

First, was the fact that many young Cretans, inspired by love for their country, hurried to enlist in this new paramilitary unit of the independent Cretan State. This meant that Craveri could choose the best. Enlistment in the Gendarmerie, which also had military duties (the foundation of Militia having been postponed permanently due to lack of funds), was considered an honorable service to the nation. Georgios Vouros, for example, abandoned his studies in the Law Faculty of Athens University in order to enlist as a simple constable, and Evangelos Sarris, who had previously abandoned his studies in order to participate in the revolution of 1898, immediately enlisted in the Gendarmerie. Both were later to be among the first Cretans commissioned into the Gendarmerie.

The other factor that helped Craveri to enforce law and order in the island was his excellent relationship with the government and Prince George, as well as the fact that the island&#x27;s authorities had the right to deport all persons who were considered dangerous. This measure was initially applied by the international authorities and the constitution of 1899 and was extended for two years as a privilege of the Prince. None of the people deported by the admirals or the Prince had the right to return to Crete unless the Prince decided so.

===Organization and uniform===
The Cretan Gendarmerie consisted of a single battalion of five companies. Although the official establishment was 1,600, under Italian command the total was never more than 1,275. One company was assigned to each &quot;nomos&quot; (prefecture). The company commanders were Carabinieri lieutenants, who in Crete were given the local rank of captain. In June 1900 Craveri was replaced by Luigi Balduini Caprini, who created a sixth headquarters company. The first company commanders were: Ferdinando Mensitieri (HQ Company), Luigi Bassi (Chania Company), Ettore Lodi (Sfakia Company), Arcangelo de Mandate (Heraklion Company), Edigio Garrone (Rethymno Company), and Filiberto Vigliani (Lasithi Company).

Each company was divided into three or four &quot;ypomoirarchies&quot; (subcompanies), each also under the command of an officer. Each &quot;ypomoirarchia&quot; had six &quot;enomoties&quot; (stations) commanded by a non-commissioned officer. Initially all officers and non-commissioned officers were Italian Carabinieri, but gradually the non-commissioned officers were replaced by Cretans. The Cretans, many of whom were well educated, were promoted rapidly after three months training at a military school operating at the headquarters, at the end of which they took examinations. Some of the Italian officers slightly changed their signatures to look Greek: Luigi Balduini Caprini, for instance, signed himself &quot;Kaprinis&quot;.

The uniform was dark blue in winter and white in summer. The constables wore the traditional Cretan &quot;vraka&quot; (voluminous breeches) and the officers wore trousers. The constables wore a round hat and the officers wore a kepi similar to that worn by officers of the Greek Army. Both officers and constables wore black boots. The constables were armed with rifle, bayonet, and revolver, while some also carried the traditional Cretan knife on their belts.

==The Cretan Gendarmerie in an autonomous Crete==
The Gendarmerie was busy upholding the public order, struggling against brigands and also performing services as saving people from drowning in the harbour of Chania.

In a very short period of time, the Cretan Gendarmerie managed to gain the trust of the Cretans and the foreigners, although the latter had initially been prejudiced against the Cretans..

During the Theriso Revolt, the Cretan Gendarmerie remained loyal to Prince George and fought against the rebels, aided by a Russian expeditionary corps. Those members of the Gendarmerie who had defected to the rebels were not included in the amnesty the rebels received later, but were allowed to leave for Greece.

==From the departure of Prince George until the Balkan Wars==
On 16 December 1906 Eugenio Monaco, third and last head of the Italian mission, delivered command of the Gendarmerie to Artillery Lieutenant Colonel Andreas Momferratos, head of the Greek mission. The first objective of the Greek mission was the creation of a militia and the equipping of the Gendarmerie with new rifles of the Mannlicher–Schönauer type. They also tried to introduce more intensive military education. The creation of battalions of militia released the Gendarmerie from certain military duties.

The Greek mission immediately began to promote of Cretans to commissioned officer rank. The first Cretans to be commissioned as lieutenants on 14 January 1907, in order of seniority, were: Evangelos Sarris, Dimitrios Kokkalas, Andreas Androulakis, Alexandros Hatzioannou, Nikiforos Nikiforakis, Zaharias Brillakis, Ilias Mourginakis, Minos Mylogiannakis, Emannouil Vogiatzakis, Georgios Vouros, and Ioannis Souris.

On the eve of the Balkan Wars in 1912 there were 45 officers, 50 senior non-commissioned officers, and 1,371 junior non-commissioned officers and constables serving in the Cretan Gendarmerie. Of the officers, five second lieutenants were physicians and one a pharmacist, while another pharmacist was a senior NCO.

Some of the officers were attached from the Greek Army, including the commander, Colonel Andreas Momferratos. Army officers constituted the entire Greek mission that replaced the Italians in December 1906.

As a direct result of the Cretan Gendarmerie&#x27;s success in its duties, the organization of the Greek Gendarmerie was also assigned to Italian officers in July 1911. Some of them, like Arcangelo de Mandate, had also participated in the organization of the Cretan Gendarmerie.

==The Balkan Wars==
On 4 October 1912 the Christian countries of the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia) declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The advance of the Greek Army was rapid and on 26 October the Turks surrendered Thessaloniki (Salonika). Eleftherios Venizelos, forecasting the problems of law and order that would be presented after the liberation of the city and knowing that the Bulgarians and other European nations would like to promote a picture of and a Greek state incapable of imposing order, ordered Cretan Gendarmerie units to be transported to the city.

Thus, on 24 October 1912 the commander of the Cretan Gendarmerie with four officers, two senior non-commissioned officers and 150 constables left from Chania for Athens and thence to Thessaloniki aboard the steamer &quot;Arcadi&quot;. This force was strengthened and eventually almost the whole of the Gendarmerie was shipped to Thessaloniki. On the 14 October 1912, the Governor-General of Crete Stefanos Dragoumis mobilised the reservist non-commissioned officers and constables enlisted in the 1880s and 1890s.

Thessalonica was then an international city. Apart from the Greeks, it was also inhabited by many Turks and Western Europeans, a very large Jewish community, and a substantial Bulgarian minority. Most of them did not welcome the Greek flag flying over the city. The Western Europeans considered that they would lose their commercial privileges; the Jews for commercial reasons would have preferred an Austrian administration or the internationalization of Thessalonica; whilst the Bulgarians, Turks and Austrians wanted the city for their own countries. The composition of population in the city of Thessalonica, according to Turkish authorities a short time before its liberation, was:
* Jews - 61,000
* Turks - 43,000
* Greeks - 40,000
* Bulgarians - 6,000
* Other nationalities - 5,000
The reader should notice that the population of the suburbs and the rural area around Thessaloniki was almost 100% Greek. 
However, to these numbers of permanent citizens there should also be added others. Because of the war the population of the city almost had been doubled. Also present were the Greek army, the Bulgarian army, gangs of Komitadji (Bulgarian irregulars), the crews of British, Russian, Austrian and French warships that were in Thessalonica in order to protect their nationals, and the Turkish troops, who according to the treaty had freedom of movement. There were also the Turkish Gendarmerie and police, who according to the treaty were not disarmed, and a large number of Turkish deserters, many of them also armed, who were wandering the streets begging for food and money. Finally, there were Muslim refugees who had been gathering in the city as a result of Bulgarian atrocities against the unarmed population. These were assembled in Panes, cemeteries and squares creating unacceptable hygiene conditions and the immediate danger of a spread of epidemics in the city.
The British correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, Crawford Price, reported: &quot;Eloquent proof of the size and gravity of the Turkish defeat lies in the thousands of the refugees, who come to Salonika like swarms of locusts. Terrified and panicked leave to save their lives from the Servo-Bulgarian advance...ask shelter and protection from the cold behind walls and wear various rags...One can see pregnant women lying in the mud, and the complete absence of all elementary sanitary precaution, and not having a single blanket...one can see women and children starving not having a single piece of bread.&quot;

The policing of the city was very difficult, with a varied population, with explosive racial and religious prejudices, with the economic problems that were created by the change of rule, with the consequences of the recent battles, but also with the lack of any infrastructure for solving these problems.

Initially, the Cretan Gendarmerie took care of the refugees by organizing them in settlements in the suburbs of the city, thus allowing the municipal workers to clean the city. They then tried to create a climate of calm and order in the city, so that all the citizens, regardless of their nationality, could feel safe. The gendarmes immediately gained the confidence and admiration of population, as it appears from the following comments in newspapers and magazines on their actions in Thessalonica:

From the French paper &quot;L&#x27; Illustration&quot;, in an article by the military correspondent Jean Len: &quot;There is something that occasionally draws the attention of the crowd. The passage of a Cretan Gendarmerie patrol, dressed in their national uniform: boots, &quot;vraka&quot;, shirt and &quot;toca&quot; hat on their heads. They are handsome men with dark hair, tall with a steady step...pride lights their faces. What a dream they live, these man who were for so long the captives of the Turks in their poor island, when they realize that they are entrusted to keep order in Thessalonica which they liberated from the Turks and which is still inhabited by so many of the previous conquerors, who now have to obey them! The presence of this Gendarmerie might calm the Bulgarian soldiers a little. Every evening they drink too much, creating problems wherever they pass.&quot;

From &quot;Morning&quot; of Thessalonica: &quot;The Cretan Gendarmes impose equally the law on civilians, partisans and soldiers, regardless of race or religion, everybody obeys to everything they impose, because everyone respects and fears them.&quot;

From &quot;New Truth&quot; of Thessalonica: &quot;The Cretan Policeman – man of duty, disciplined and decent, managed from the first days to impose order...So in a short period of time Thessalonica had the fortune to see a peace and order that during the last years of Turkish occupation could not even be dreamt of. What men, what great lads. How handsome, decent and strong these Cretan Gendarmes...There is not soil in the world able to give birth to men better and braver than Cretans.&quot;

From &quot;Time&quot; of Athens (C. Chairopoulos): &quot;Excellent in their carriage, discipline, organization, every man chosen with the serious sight of American or British policemen, they patrol the city inspiring respect in all citizens regardless of nationality. Trained well, military by nature, brave of character, strengthened by exercise, they are a formidable force.&quot;

From &quot;Time&quot; of Moscow: &quot;Unfortunately not all countries have the brave men of Crete in order to create such a Gendarmerie.&quot;

The Bulgarians did not cease their efforts to make Thessalonica seem like a city in anarchy or to make it appear that they were also in control. On the night of 31 October, only five days after the liberation, a group of Bulgarian irregulars blew up a big Turkish ammunition dump in the suburb of Zeitelik. As a result, some Turkish prisoners and a few Greek cavalry troopers were killed. Soon afterwards, the Bulgarian irregulars started lighting fires and slaughtering the Turkish non-combatants. The Cretan gendarmes attacked them and forced them to stop their actions and retreat to the Bulgarian army barracks to seek protection.

This was the first in a series of incidents involving the Bulgarians. In the following days they started occupying mosques and turning them into Bulgarian churches, insulting the religious feelings of the Muslim citizens, who protested to the Greek authorities. The Cretan Gendarmerie, with the help of the Greek Army, intervened to protect the Muslims. Most of these mosques had been converted from Greek Orthodox churches when the Turks first captured the city five centuries before.

In another case, &quot;Ipenomotarchis&quot; John Petrakis, who with ten other gendarmes was guarding the railway station, discovered a Bulgarian plot to blow up the station. He arrested the Bulgarians and confiscated 100 kilograms of gunpowder and some rifles. Elsewhere, the French post office was closed after a Bulgarian officer shot the clerks because they would not accept Bulgarian banknotes.

According to the report of the French military correspondent Jean Len, the whole population of Thessalonica disliked the Bulgarians. The only exception was the Jewish community, which initially, following the orders of the Austrian counsellor, gave to the Bulgarian army buildings that they refused to give to the Greek Army. Later, however, the Jewish community changed their point of view

==Capture of Bulgarian units in Thessalonica==
On 17 June 1913 the Bulgarians, without any declaration of war, attacked the Greek Army. The Second Division and the Cretan Gendarmerie were given the task of neutralising the Bulgarian units in Thessalonica. The Cretan Gendarmerie was ordered to capture the various small Bulgarian units scattered around the city, while the Second Division was to capture the larger units of Bulgarian Army.

Later the same day General Kallaris sent the following message to the commander of Bulgarian forces in Thessalonica :

Sir,
Since Bulgarian troops began hostilities in the countryside against our Army, I have the honour to request you to leave the city of Thessalonica one hour after the delivery of this letter.
The arms of your men must be delivered to our officers, while your officers may keep their swords. A train will transport your men to the front and measures will be taken to allow them to safely pass the front line. After this deadline expires I must, to my regret, give orders that your troops will be considered hostile.

As expected, the Bulgarians ignored the ultimatum and plans for their disarmament were initiated. The operations began in the afternoon of the same day and lasted until the morning of the next day.

Bulgarian units were located in the Rotunda, in the building of the Faculty of Public Employees, in the church of Saint Sofia, in the buildings along the Hamidiye road, in the Turkish school on Kassandrou Street, and inside the Ioannidios School. The Bulgarian headquarters were located in a large house that belonged to the banker Samouel Mouson.

Soldiers and Cretan gendarmes encircled the Public Employees building and firing from the houses opposite forced the Bulgarians to surrender. The Bulgarian units that were located in the buildings on Hamidiye road surrendered after a hard battle. Gendarmes and soldiers positioned in the houses opposite continued firing at them until the Bulgarians surrendered. The bullet holes in the facades of the buildings could still be seen until their destruction during the earthquake of 20 June 1978.

In the Turkish school Ticaret Mectebi on Kassandrou Road and in the Bulgarian consulate there were about one hundred Bulgarian irregulars (&quot;komitadjis&quot;), who were used to attack the Greek headquarters. The &quot;komitadjis&quot; were always causing problems, walking provocatively in the streets, and they often attacked Turkish refugees housed nearby. On the afternoon of 17 June a unit of gendarmes commanded by &quot;Ypenomotarchis&quot; Emmanuel Tsakonas encircled the building and called on the Bulgarians to surrender. When they refused, heavy firing began that lasted into the next morning. Then Tsakonas resorted to a trick. He entered the courtyard of the school carrying a &quot;bomb&quot; and threatened to blow up the building unless they surrendered in one hour. The Bulgarians surrendered without realising that the supposed bomb was actually a bottle of mineral water.

Lieutenant Hatzioannou with his unit attacked, neutralised and arrested the guard of the Bulgarian post office and bank in the Grant hotel.

The fighting was hard in Saint Sofia, where sergeant Avatzos&#x27;s unit had the task of capturing the Bulgarians who were holed up in the church. At one point in the battle the Bulgarians raised a white flag. As soon as the Cretans advanced in order to arrest them the Bulgarians started firing again, wounding two gendarmes. Then the Cretans assaulted with fixed bayonets and captured all the surviving Bulgarians.

At the Roman monument of Rotunda, the Greek soldiers, taking positions in the terraces of the surrounding houses and aided by many citizens, fired at the tents of the Bulgarians located in the courtyard and against the windows of Rotunda until they surrendered.

In total, 1,300 Bulgarian soldiers were arrested, including seventeen officers and General Hesapsiev, who was transported aboard the steamer &quot;Marietta Rialdi&quot; to Piraeus, where he was held until the end of war.

==After the Balkan Wars==
In July 1913 the Cretan Gendarmerie was incorporated into the Greek Gendarmerie. However the majority of its personnel remained in Macedonia, and the distinctive uniform was retained. In 1914 a &quot;Battalion of Gendarmerie of the Expeditionary Army&quot; was created, consisting of four companies, mainly reservist gendarmes of the Cretan Gendarmerie.

Unfortunately, peace did not last long. On 22 September 1915, ignoring Greek neutrality, Allied forces occupied Thessaloniki to further their plans for a Macedonian front. In December 1915 Italian and French forces occupied the Greek island of Corfu, where they gathered the remnants of the Serbian Army and Government.

King Constantine wanted to keep Greece neutral and did not wish to participate in a war that might end in economic and/or military disaster for Greece. After all, Greece had doubled its territories after the Balkan Wars. The soldiers wanted to return at their homes and there were many economic problems as a result of the Army&#x27;s mobilisation. Also many Greeks were angry with the Italians and French, who after the Balkan Wars did not support the Greek claims on the liberated lands of Macedonia and Northern Epirus.

On the other hand, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos believed that Greece had an obligation to help Serbia and enter the war with the Allies against the Central Powers. The main thrust of his policy was that Greece, as a maritime nation, should always follow Britain&#x27;s lead. He hoped that Greece again had the chance to liberate the many Greeks still living under Turkish rule.

The King was accused of being pro-German due to his relationship to the Kaiser. However, he was also a cousin of the Tsar and the British King.

By the end of 1915 it was obvious that neutrality could not be maintained and that Greek sovereignty was being eroded day by day. A group of influential Greek Macedonian citizens and officers, believing that the Allies may give Greek Macedonian grounds to the Serbs, decided on a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; in order to force King Constantine to abandon neutrality and enter the war in favour of the Allies. This group, the Committee of National Defence, was led by D. Ligas, Periklis Argyropoulos, Alexandros Zannas, K. Aggelakis, N. Manos, Pazis, Grekos, Pamikos Zymvrakakis, Th. Koutoupis and others. The leadership was offered to the now ex-Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who strongly believed that Greece should enter the war in favour of the Allies. Venizelos agreed on condition that military units should be committed on all fronts and not only in Macedonia.

In March 1916 the German and Bulgarian forces started occupying Greek territories in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. Bulgarian forces, intent on expelling the Greek population from the area, started a campaign of terror, slaughtering civilians, burning villages, raping women and children, and robbing the population. The Germans objected to these atrocities, but did not wish to displease their allies too much. Once again refugees, Greeks this time, began flooding into Thessaloniki.

Cretans and other Greek soldiers who could not tolerate the occupation of Greek soil by the Bulgarian army started volunteering for the Allied armies in order to fight against the Central Powers. The Greek high command started transferring units from Thessaloniki to Southern Greece in order to maintain discipline and avoid provocative actions against the Allied forces who were in Thessaloniki.

==The National Defence &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;==
On 21 May 1916, the day of King Constantine&#x27;s name-day, the French forces of General Sarrail imposed martial law in Thessaloniki (despite British opposition), occupying the post office, the telegraph office, the telephone office, the railway facilities, the power station, and the gasworks.

Simultaneously they imposed censorship in the press, forcibly closed two newspapers and expelled five Greek officers with whom they considered that could not work: Colonel Troupakis, commanding the constabulary, Lieutenant-Colonel Nidriotis, commanding the police, Colonel Messalas, commanding Fortress Thessalonica, his chief of staff Lieutenant-Colonel Gouvelis, and Colonel Bouklakos, commanding the artillery.

Any form of Greek sovereignty in the Allied-occupied Greek territories had been eliminated. The French naval attaché Lieutenant-Commander de Rokfeill reported in September 1916: &quot;There is not any question of concern for the sovereign rights of Greece because no-one remains in this country that has not been violated&quot;.

In April 1916 the new Serbian Army of 120,000 men was transported to the Macedonian front. Simultaneously the King of Serbia and his government arrived in Thessalonica. In this situation and with the danger that the Allies would proclaim Thessalonica capital of the Kingdom of Serbia, the Committee of National Defence on 17 August 1916 decided to mount their &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. The representative of the Cretan Gendarmerie on this Committee was Captain D. Kokkalas. The decision was taken after General Sarrail threatened to nominate a Serbian prefect in Thessalonica and despite the possible objections of Venizelos. Afterwards the Committee of National Defence issued two proclamations, to the population and to the army.

Lieutenant-Colonel Konstantinos Mazarakis tried without success to convince the 11th Artillery Battalion to take part in the coup. But all army units remained loyal to the legal government and only individual officers and soldiers took part in the coup, mostly men from units of the IV Army Corps who had felt the humiliation of surrendering Greek lands to the Bulgarians without a fight.

The Cretan Gendarmerie, however, managed to overcome the loyal forces in Thessaloniki and to initiate the coup. Many of the Gendarmerie officers were already insiders in the conspiracy. After the declaration of the Committee of National Defence, the first Gendarmerie unit to revolt was the Second Company of Gendarmerie that was attached to the army, commanded by Second Lieutenant Emmanuel Tsakonas. This was followed by other companies of Cretan Gendarmerie, including the First Company (First Class Captain Evangelos Sarris), the Second Company (Captain Pavlides), and HQ Company (Major Panousopoulos). All officers and gendarmes of the Cretan Gendarmerie participated voluntarily at the coup. Even the Italian Lieutenant Farughi, still serving with the Gendarmerie, participated at the coup.

Cavalry Lieutenant-Colonel Zymvrakakis, who was a member of the National Defence Committee, undertook the leadership of the coup and led the troops to the general headquarters of the Allied forces. There he announced to General Sarraill that they wished to put themselves under his orders. The British officer Price C. Ward in his book &quot;The Story Of The Salonica Army&quot; wrote: &quot;General Sarrail accepted their offer since he already had the habit of accepting Greek volunteers from the moment Bulgarians had entered Greece.&quot;

The only organised units that participated at the coup were the Cretan Gendarmerie and the volunteer battalion that was already under French orders. Alexandros Zannas, a member of the National Defence committee, wrote that &quot;the situation was curious. We (the rebels) had occupied the city of Thessaloniki (17 August 1916) based only on the forces of the Cretan Gendarmerie.&quot;

Athinogenis, the prefect of Thessaloniki, and the assistant district attorney convinced the officers of the loyal troops not to try to suppress the rebels immediately. Then the rebels tried to surround the loyal units. Fortunately, the occasional firing only resulted in three dead and seven wounded. The next day French troops forced the loyal units to surrender. It was a tragic irony that the French bayonets that had created the conditions for a civil war with the occupation of Greek territories at this moment prevented one.

In the following days the coup was established in other Greek Macedonian cities, Crete and other islands, always with the help of Cretan Gendarmerie officers like Captain Vouros in Veria.

<text>Davy Arnaud (; born June 22, 1980) is an American soccer coach and former player. During his professional career, he played for Sporting Kansas City, Montreal Impact, and D.C. United, and served on the coaching staff of D.C. United and Houston Dynamo. Arnaud also made seven appearances for the United States national team, scoring one goal. He is currently an assistant coach at Austin FC.

==Career==

===College===
Arnaud played college soccer at West Texas A&amp;M University from 1999 to 2001, finishing his career with 31 goals and 11 assists. In his junior year he scored 13 goals and 3 assists, becoming a Division II NCAA All-American, the first from his school.

===Professional===
After his junior year, Arnaud turned professional, and was drafted 50th overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards. He hardly played at all his first year, registering only 43 minutes in three games. Although his second year began much the same, Arnaud began to get significant time as the year progressed, and finished the year having played in 18 games, and scored three goals. Although his performance in 2003 boded well for his 2004 season, Arnaud exceeded everybody&#x27;s expectations. After Preki and Igor Simutenkov went down with long-term injuries before the beginning of the season, Arnaud was given a starting role in the Wizards&#x27; offense next to Josh Wolff. Arnaud proved he deserved the opportunity from the outset, and went on to start all 30 of Kansas City&#x27;s games, scoring nine goals and eight assists while leading the club to first place in the Western Conference.

Arnaud remained a starter for the club for the next several years. Before the 2010 season, Arnaud was named the team&#x27;s new captain by coach Peter Vermes. During the 2011 season injuries limited his play but he still remained a key player for the club helping Sporting to a first place Eastern Conference finish during the regular season.

On November 28, 2011, Arnaud was traded to new expansion team Montreal Impact for defender Seth Sinovic and allocation money. He was named captain of the Montreal Impact for the team&#x27;s first season in Major League Soccer. On March 17, 2012, before a crowd of 58,912 at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Arnaud scored the first ever goal for the Montreal Impact in MLS in the 56th minute by heading a cross from Sanna Nyassi into the top right corner against Chicago Fire keeper Paolo Tornaghi.

On December 10, 2013, Arnaud was traded to D.C. United in exchange for an international roster slot.

On March 3, 2016, Arnaud officially announced his retirement. In his professional career he played 351 games, scored 50 goals, and recorded 46 assists.

===Coaching===
Upon retirement from playing, Arnaud immediately joined the D.C. United&#x27;s coaching staff as an assistant coach.

Arnaud joined the Houston Dynamo in late 2016 as an assistant coach, joining Wilmer Cabrera back in his native Texas. Upon Cabrera&#x27;s departure from the club after a 9–13–3 start to the 2019 season, Arnaud was elevated to the role of interim head coach. Arnaud went 3–5–1 in the interim role before Tab Ramos was named permanent head coach.

On July 13, 2020, Arnaud was named assistant coach for Austin FC, joining Josh Wolff&#x27;s staff for the expansion club&#x27;s inaugural campaign.

===International===
Arnaud made his first appearance for the United States national team as a late substitute during the U.S.&#x27;s 4–2 friendly defeat against Brazil on September 9, 2007, at Soldier Field in Chicago. He scored his first international goal on July 11, 2009, against Haiti in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts.

<doc id="1136447" wikidata="Q1077769" url="?curid=1136447" title="Microcanonical ensemble">
<text>In statistical mechanics, the microcanonical ensemble is a statistical ensemble that represents the possible states of a mechanical system whose total energy is exactly specified. The system is assumed to be isolated in the sense that it cannot exchange energy or particles with its environment, so that (by conservation of energy) the energy of the system does not change with time.

The primary macroscopic variables of the microcanonical ensemble are the total number of particles in the system (symbol: ), the system&#x27;s volume (symbol: ), as well as the total energy in the system (symbol: ). Each of these is assumed to be constant in the ensemble. For this reason, the microcanonical ensemble is sometimes called the ensemble.

In simple terms, the microcanonical ensemble is defined by assigning an equal probability to every microstate whose energy falls within a range centered at . All other microstates are given a probability of zero. Since the probabilities must add up to 1, the probability is the inverse of the number of microstates within the range of energy,
:formula_1
The range of energy is then reduced in width until it is infinitesimally narrow, still centered at . In the limit of this process, the microcanonical ensemble is obtained.

== Applicability ==

Because of its connection with the elementary assumptions of equilibrium statistical mechanics (particularly the postulate of a priori equal probabilities), the microcanonical ensemble is an important conceptual building block in the theory. It is sometimes considered to be the fundamental distribution of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It is also useful in some numerical applications, such as molecular dynamics. On the other hand, most nontrivial systems are mathematically cumbersome to describe in the microcanonical ensemble, and there are also ambiguities regarding the definitions of entropy and temperature. For these reasons, other ensembles are often preferred for theoretical calculations.

The applicability of the microcanonical ensemble to real-world systems depends on the importance of energy fluctuations, which may result from interactions between the system and its environment as well as uncontrolled factors in preparing the system. Generally, fluctuations are negligible if a system is macroscopically large, or if it is manufactured with precisely known energy and thereafter maintained in near isolation from its environment. In such cases the microcanonical ensemble is applicable. Otherwise, different ensembles are more appropriate – such as the canonical ensemble (fluctuating energy) or the grand canonical ensemble (fluctuating energy and particle number).

== Properties ==
=== Thermodynamic quantities ===
The fundamental thermodynamic potential of the microcanonical ensemble is entropy. There are at least three possible definitions, each given in terms of the phase volume function . In classical mechanics this is the volume of the region of phase space where the energy is less than . In quantum mechanics is roughly the number of energy eigenstates with energy less than ; however this must be smoothed so that we can take its derivative (see the Precise expressions section for details on how this is done). The definitions of microcanonical entropy are:
In the microcanonical ensemble, the temperature is a derived quantity rather than an external control parameter. It is defined as the derivative of the chosen entropy with respect to energy. For example, one can define the &quot;temperatures&quot; and as follows:
: formula_2
: formula_3
Like entropy, there are multiple ways to understand temperature in the microcanonical ensemble. More generally, the correspondence between these ensemble-based definitions and their thermodynamic counterparts is not perfect, particularly for finite systems.

The microcanonical pressure and chemical potential are given by:
: formula_4

=== Phase transitions ===
Under their strict definition, phase transitions correspond to nonanalytic behavior in the thermodynamic potential or its derivatives. Using this definition, phase transitions in the microcanonical ensemble can occur in systems of any size. This contrasts with the canonical and grand canonical ensembles, for which phase transitions can occur only in the thermodynamic limit – i.e., in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. Roughly speaking, the reservoirs defining the canonical or grand canonical ensembles introduce fluctuations that &quot;smooth out&quot; any nonanalytic behavior in the free energy of finite systems. This smoothing effect is usually negligible in macroscopic systems, which are sufficiently large that the free energy can approximate nonanalytic behavior exceedingly well. However, the technical difference in ensembles may be important in the theoretical analysis of small systems.

=== Information entropy ===
For a given mechanical system (fixed , ) and a given range of energy, the uniform distribution of probability over microstates (as in the microcanonical ensemble) maximizes the ensemble average .

== Thermodynamic analogies ==

Early work in statistical mechanics by Ludwig Boltzmann led to his eponymous entropy equation for a system of a given total energy, , where is the number of distinct states accessible by the system at that energy. Boltzmann did not elaborate too deeply on what exactly constitutes the set of distinct states of a system, besides the special case of an ideal gas. This topic was investigated to completion by Josiah Willard Gibbs who developed the generalized statistical mechanics for arbitrary mechanical systems, and defined the microcanonical ensemble described in this article. Gibbs investigated carefully the analogies between the microcanonical ensemble and thermodynamics, especially how they break down in the case of systems of few degrees of freedom. He introduced two further definitions of microcanonical entropy that do not depend on – the volume and surface entropy described above. (Note that the surface entropy differs from the Boltzmann entropy only by an -dependent offset.)

The volume entropy formula_5 and associated temperature formula_6 are closely analogous to thermodynamic entropy and temperature. It is possible to show exactly that
: formula_7

( is the ensemble average pressure) as expected for the first law of thermodynamics. A similar equation can be found for the surface entropy formula_8 (or Boltzmann entropy formula_9) and its associated temperature , however the &quot;pressure&quot; in this equation is a complicated quantity unrelated to the average pressure.

The microcanonical temperatures formula_6 and formula_11 are not entirely satisfactory in their analogy to temperature as defined using a canonical ensemble. Outside of the thermodynamic limit, a number of artefacts occur.
* &quot;Nontrivial result of combining two systems&quot;: Two systems, each described by an independent microcanonical ensemble, can be brought into thermal contact and be allowed to equilibriate into a combined system also described by a microcanonical ensemble. Unfortunately, the energy flow between the two systems cannot be predicted based on the initial s. Even when the initial s are equal, there may be energy transferred. Moreover, the of the combination is different from the initial values. This contradicts the intuition that temperature should be an intensive quantity, and that two equal-temperature systems should be unaffected by being brought into thermal contact.
* &quot;Strange behavior for few-particle systems&quot;: Many results such as the microcanonical Equipartition theorem acquire a one- or two-degree of freedom offset when written in terms of . For a small systems this offset is significant, and so if we make the analogue of entropy, several exceptions need to be made for systems with only one or two degrees of freedom.
* &quot;Spurious negative temperatures&quot;: A negative occurs whenever the density of states is decreasing with energy. In some systems the density of states is not monotonic in energy, and so can change sign multiple times as the energy is increased.

The preferred solution to these problems is avoid use of the microcanonical ensemble. In many realistic cases a system is thermostatted to a heat bath so that the energy is not precisely known. Then, a more accurate description is the canonical ensemble or grand canonical ensemble, both of which have complete correspondence to thermodynamics.

== Precise expressions for the ensemble ==

The precise mathematical expression for a statistical ensemble depends on the kind of mechanics under consideration – quantum or classical – since the notion of a &quot;microstate&quot; is considerably different in these two cases. In quantum mechanics, diagonalization provides a discrete set of microstates with specific energies. The classical mechanical case involves instead an integral over canonical phase space, and the size of microstates in phase space can be chosen somewhat arbitrarily.

To construct the microcanonical ensemble, it is necessary in both types of mechanics to first specify a range of energy. In the expressions below the function formula_12 (a function of , peaking at with width ) will be used to represent the range of energy in which to include states. An example of this function would be
: formula_13
or, more smoothly,
: formula_14

=== Quantum mechanical ===

A statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a density matrix, denoted by formula_15. The microcanonical ensemble can be written using bra–ket notation, in terms of the system&#x27;s energy eigenstates and energy eigenvalues. Given a complete basis of energy eigenstates , indexed by , the microcanonical ensemble is
: formula_16
where the are the energy eigenvalues determined by formula_17 (here is the system&#x27;s total energy operator, i. e., Hamiltonian operator). The value of is determined by demanding that formula_15 is a normalized density matrix, and so
: formula_19
The state volume function (used to calculate entropy) is given by
: formula_20

The microcanonical ensemble is defined by taking the limit of the density matrix as the energy width goes to zero, however a problematic situation occurs once the energy width becomes smaller than the spacing between energy levels. For very small energy width, the ensemble does not exist at all for most values of , since no states fall within the range. When the ensemble does exist, it typically only contains one (or two) states, since in a complex system the energy levels are only ever equal by accident (see random matrix theory for more discussion on this point). Moreover, the state-volume function also increases only in discrete increments, and so its derivative is only ever infinite or zero, making it difficult to define the density of states. This problem can be solved by not taking the energy range completely to zero and smoothing the state-volume function, however this makes the definition of the ensemble more complicated, since it becomes then necessary to specify the energy range in addition to other variables (together, an ensemble).

=== Classical mechanical ===

In classical mechanics, an ensemble is represented by a joint probability density function defined over the system&#x27;s phase space. The phase space has generalized coordinates called , and associated canonical momenta called .

The probability density function for the microcanonical ensemble is:
: formula_21
where
* is the total energy (Hamiltonian) of the system, a function of the phase ,
* is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of , setting the extent of one microstate and providing correct dimensions to .
* is an overcounting correction factor, often used for particle systems where identical particles are able to change place with each other.

Again, the value of is determined by demanding that is a normalized probability density function:
: formula_22
This integral is taken over the entire phase space. The state volume function (used to calculate entropy) is defined by
: formula_23

As the energy width is taken to zero, the value of decreases in proportion to as .

Based on the above definition, the microcanonical ensemble can be visualized as an infinitesimally thin shell in phase space, centered on a constant-energy surface. Although the microcanonical ensemble is confined to this surface, it is not necessarily uniformly distributed over that surface: if the gradient of energy in phase space varies, then the microcanonical ensemble is &quot;thicker&quot; (more concentrated) in some parts of the surface than others. This feature is an unavoidable consequence of requiring that the microcanonical ensemble is a steady-state ensemble.

== Examples ==
=== Ideal gas ===
The fundamental quantity in the microcanonical ensemble is formula_24, which is equal to the phase space volume compatible with given formula_25. From formula_26, all thermodynamic quantities can be calculated. For an ideal gas, the energy is independent of the particle positions, which therefore contribute a factor of formula_27 to formula_26. The momenta, by contrast, are constrained to a formula_29-dimensional (hyper-)spherical shell of radius formula_30; their contribution is equal to the surface volume of this shell. The resulting expression for formula_26 is:
: formula_32
where formula_33 is the gamma function, and the factor formula_34 has been included to account for the indistinguishability of particles (see Gibbs paradox). In the large formula_35 limit, the Boltzmann entropy formula_36 is
: formula_37
This is also known as the Sackur–Tetrode equation.

The temperature is given by
: formula_38
which agrees with analogous result from the kinetic theory of gases. Calculating the pressure gives the ideal gas law:
: formula_39
Finally, the chemical potential formula_40 is
: formula_41

=== Ideal gas in a uniform gravitational field ===
The microcanonical phase volume can also be calculated explicitly for an ideal gas in a uniform gravitational field.

The results are stated below for a 3-dimensional ideal gas of formula_35 particles, each with mass formula_43, confined in a thermally isolated container that is infinitely long in the &quot;z&quot;-direction and has constant cross-sectional area formula_44. The gravitational field is assumed to act in the minus &quot;z&quot; direction with strength formula_45. The phase volume formula_46 is
: formula_47
where formula_48 is the total energy, kinetic plus gravitational.

The gas density formula_49 as a function of height formula_50 can be obtained by integrating over the phase volume coordinates. The result is:
: formula_51
Similarly, the distribution of the velocity magnitude formula_52 (averaged over all heights) is
: formula_53
The analogues of these equations in the canonical ensemble are the barometric formula and the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, respectively. In the limit formula_54, the microcanonical and canonical expressions coincide; however, they differ for finite formula_35. In particular, in the microcanonical ensemble, the positions and velocities are not statistically independent. As a result, the kinetic temperature, defined as the average kinetic energy in a given volume formula_56, is nonuniform throughout the container:
: formula_57
By contrast, the temperature is uniform in the canonical ensemble, for any formula_35.

<doc id="1136451" wikidata="Q953998" url="?curid=1136451" title="Philip Klutznick">
<text>Philip Morris Klutznick (July 9, 1907 – August 14, 1999) was a U.S. administrator who served as U.S. Secretary of Commerce from January 9, 1980, to January 19, 1981, under President Jimmy Carter. He was a prominent leader of several Jewish organisations, including as president of the World Jewish Congress from 1977 to 1979.

==Early life==
Klutznick was born on July 9, 1907, in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Morris and Minnie Klutznick, who had emigrated from Russian Poland two years earlier. In 1924, Klutznick participated in the formation of the second chapter of the Jewish fraternal youth organization Aleph Zadik Aleph (AZA). He became the 2nd Grand Aleph Godol (International Teen President) of the expanding organization in 1925. After high school, he became the first executive director of AZA.

He attended the University of Kansas at Lawrence and the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and received an LL.B. degree in 1930 from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. After school, he worked as an attorney and became involved in housing construction. During World War II, he was responsible for building homes for defense workers in the eastern United States including the construction of the residential town of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where parts of the atomic bomb were being developed in the Manhattan Project. After the war, he built suburban shopping malls in the Chicago area in partnership with the Chicago department store chain, Marshall Field &amp; Company.

==Career==
Klutznick&#x27;s career in public service advanced along with his success in business. After World War II, he joined American Community Developers to create Park Forest, a suburb south of Chicago. In 1953, he was elected to the first of two three-year terms as president of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. His presidency focused on strengthening the century-old organization&#x27;s internal structure and expanding its constituency. He visited B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith districts worldwide and worked to strengthen lodges in post-war Europe and Israel. Domestically, he instituted a membership drive, expanded support for youth programs and travelled in the Southern United States to discuss B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith support for school desegregation and the growing civil rights movement.

Klutznick was also active in international affairs. In 1957, he served a three-month term as a United Nations delegate. He gained the rank of ambassador as US representative on the UN Economic and Social Council in 1960, working closely with United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson II. Klutznick resigned his UN post two years later, contending that a failure to integrate political goals with economic and social needs undermined the effectiveness of international diplomacy. In later years, he remained active in international affairs, completing a survey of Brazilian housing for the Johnson administration, writing and speaking frequently on international issues and working with the United Nations Association of the United States of America.

Klutznick had a special interest in the Middle East and in Israel–United States relations. As B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith president, he travelled to Israel and advocated the use of German reparations funds to support Jewish organizations. He was among the American Jewish leaders to meet with President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to discuss Middle Eastern policy and events. In 1977, Klutznick became president of the World Jewish Congress, succeeding Nahum Goldmann who had led the group since 1949. During negotiations that preceded the 1977 Camp David Accords, Klutznick met with Israeli leader Menachem Begin, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and Jimmy Carter, as well as other US administration officials. In 1978, Klutznick initiated a commission headed by Guy de Rothschild to examine the economic implications of Arab-Israeli peace for Israel and the international Jewish community. Another focus of his leadership was Jewish culture, demonstrated in efforts to strengthen and reorganize the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and Beit Hatfutsot, the museum of the Jewish diaspora. Klutznick&#x27;s service as WJC President was brief. He took a leave of absence upon his confirmation vote as Secretary of Commerce in 1979, and chose to leave the position to his replacement, Edgar Bronfman, Sr, after leaving the government.

Klutznick&#x27;s views on Middle Eastern issues were often controversial in the American and international Jewish communities. He considered himself a Zionist, and a strong defender of Israel, but encouraged dialogue with Arab groups and leaders. In 1975, he served on a &quot;Middle East Study Group&quot;, sponsored by the Brookings Institution, which produced a report encouraging both Israeli and Arab concessions and active involvement by the US government. In 1981, he travelled to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and the West Bank as part of a private group to meet with leaders in government, education, military affairs, business and communications, as well as political dissidents. The resulting &quot;Seven Springs Report&quot; attempted to provide a base of knowledge and understanding for the conduct of future negotiations and peace plans. In June 1982, Klutznick joined with Nahum Goldmann, former president of the World Jewish Congress, and Pierre Mendès France, former prime minister of France, to issue the &quot;Paris Declaration&quot;, encouraging an end to Israel&#x27;s siege of Beirut and negotiation with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to ensure regional peace and security. Klutznick&#x27;s involvement in each of these reports and statements prompted both widespread support and protest from Jewish organizations and individuals.

In January 1980, Klutznick began service as U.S. Secretary of Commerce under 39th President Jimmy Carter. He took office at the age of 72, making him the oldest first-time appointee to cabinet in U.S. history. That record was broken in 2017 when Wilbur Ross became Secretary of Commerce at the age of 79. Klutznick had long-standing relationships with Vice-President Walter Mondale and U.S. Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance and his ties to the Carter administration were further strengthened by his significant role in Arab-Israeli peace talks. His appointment was viewed by some critics as an effort to strengthen Carter&#x27;s status among Jewish voters. Klutznick&#x27;s tenure was marked by the economic recession and inflation that characterized the later years of the Carter administration, Carter&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for re-election, and the completion of the 1980 census.

==Personal life==
Klutznick married Ethel Riekes in 1930. They had six children, Bettylu, Richard, who died in early childhood, Thomas, James, Robert and Samuel. Ethel Klutznick died in 1996. Philip M. Klutznick died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on August 14, 1999.

He served as president of the Chicago Bulls franchise in 1973.

His daughter, Bettylu Saltzman, is widely credited with helping launch President Barack Obama&#x27;s political career. She introduced the then-community organizer to David Axelrod in 1992.

<text>Rheinstetten (; South Franconian: &quot;Rhoischdedde&quot;) is a town in the west of Baden-Württemberg on the border to Rhineland-Palatinate. It is situated to the south-west of Karlsruhe and belongs to the rural district of Karlsruhe. The city has fewer inhabitants than Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Bretten and Stutensee and is therefore the fifth largest city in the district of Karlsruhe. Since 2005 it has formed part of a regional organization for economy, science, culture and administration, the Technologieregion Karlsruhe.

&quot;Rheinstetten&quot; was formed in 1975 by a merger of the former municipalities of Forchheim, Morsch and Neuburgweier. In 2000 it received town privileges and became a district seat on 1 January 2005.

==Geography==
The town is located in the Upper Rhine Plain, about 10 km southwest of Karlsruhe. The Black Forest is ten kilometers to the east. The Rhine forms the west border of the town and also marks the border to Rhineland-Palatinate. A small river, called the Federbach flows through the town. In the South the town borders on the municipality of Durmersheim. The federal highway 36 splits the city; to the west of the highway lies the city, to the south is agricultural land. Further to the east is a forest named Hardtwald.

===City Structure===
The urban area of Rheinstetten consists of the three districts of Mörsch, Forchheim and Neuburgweier.

The district of Forchheim consists of the following villages: Forchheim, &quot;Dammfeldsiedlung&quot;, Silberstreifen and includes the 19th century &quot;Durmerheimer Landstraße&quot; house and &quot;Nußbaumäcker&quot; estate. The abandoned village of &quot;Derssloch&quot; is also within the district area of Forchheim. The district of Mörsch consists of the village Mörsch and the gravel pit. Neuburgweier has no further land aside from the village itself. The abandoned villages of &quot;Königsmörsch&quot; and &quot;Staudendorf&quot; lie within Neuburgweier.

In addition to Neuburgweier being a city district, it is also an &quot;Ortschaft&quot; (provincial town) of Baden-Württemberg, which means it has certain rights according to the Gemeindeordnung [council law).

===Neighboring Cities===
The neighboring cities of Rheinstetten are on one side of the Rhine:Karlsruhe, Ettlingen (in Karlsruhe (district)), Durmersheim and Au am Rhein(in Rastatt (district)) and, on the other side of the Rhine in Rhineland-Palatinate the city Neuburg am Rhein (in Germersheim (district)).

==History==
Rheinstetten was founded on 1 January 1975, in the course of the reformation of municipalities in Baden-Württemberg. Three communities, Forchheim, Mörsch and Neuburgweier merged to form the district of Rheinstetten. By 1993 Rheinstetten had 23,000 inhabitants. It was thus the largest municipality of Baden-Württemberg in the 1990s without town privileges, and so it received these on 1 January 2000. Despite its size, the city did not apply to become a district seat until 2004. Then, on 14 September 2004, it was decided that Rheinstetten became a district seat of 2005, by the order of the Baden-Württemberg Council of Ministers.

===City Districts===
====Forchheim====
In 1086 Forchheim was mentioned for the first time in an official document by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor; ‘Vorechheim’ was noted as a gift. Until 1100 Forchheim was the principle estate of &quot;Ufgau&quot;, known as County Forchheim. The rule of this county was gradually taken from the Forchheim-Malch family and in 1086 came under the rule of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer. Then Forchheim was given to Herman V (Margrave of Baden-Baden), then returned to the county and in 1219 passed back to Herman V (Margrave of Baden-Baden), who became the liege lord of Forchheim. Later, Forchheim came under the administration of Mühlburg and in the course of the division of lands it went to the Margraviate of Baden. At this time it belonged to the administration of Ettlingen. In 1921, it became part of the district office Karlsruhe, which in 1938 became the district Karlsruhe.

Since 1963 the head office of Bruker has been in Silberstreifen. Bruker is a manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research and has over 4,000 employees..

====Mörsch====
In 940 Mörsch was mentioned as &#x27;Meriske&#x27; in a document in which emperor Otto III gave the village to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer. The Ministrialis of Mörsch, or the Eberstein family, ruled over the village in the 12th century. Eventually the village became the fiefdom of Margrave Hermann VIII of Baden). In 1306, he sold it to the Abbey of Herrenalb, but was able to buy it back in later years. Since 1291 most of the village belonged to the Weißenburg monastery, which then became the owner of the entire village in 1339. In 1350, Mörsch finally ended up in Baden, as part of the administrative district Mühlbürg. During the division of lands in 1535, Mörsch was handed over to the Baden-Baden family and thus belonged to the administration office of Ettlingen. After the dissolution of the administration office, Mörsch belonged to the district Karlsruhe.

====Neuburgweier====

In 1219 Neuburgweier was mentioned for the first time in an official document. The document discussed the distribution of the property of the Eberstein brothers. In 1383, Neuburgweier was handed over to the Electorate of the Palatinate. In 1396, the first mention of &quot;Wilre&quot; (meaning &quot;Weiler&quot;) in an official document can be found. The name &quot;Neuburgweiler&quot; was mentioned in 1422. The village was always mentioned in connection with Neuburg am Rhein and thus belonged to the Palatine dsictrict Hagenbach-Germersheim. In the 16th century, Neuburgweier was separated from Neuburg through the natural change in the course of the Rhine. In 1674, French soldiers occupied the village and was handed over to the French in 1682. It remained in French hands until 1697. In 1707, through an exchange of estates, the village became part of the lands of the Margraviate of Baden-Baden (and thus belonged to the administrative district Ettlingen). After the dissolution of the district Ettlingen in 1937, it belonged to the district Karlsruhe.

On 1 January 1975, Forchheim, Mörsch and Neuburgweier gave up their autonomy and merged into the municipality of Rheinstetten.

===Population development===
Population figures according to city district Forchheim, Mörsch and Neuburgweier respectively. The numbers were taken from official population counts.

===Religion===
The city council of Rheinstetten originally belonged to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer. There is a church in Forchheim which is consecrated to Saint Martin and has existed since 1408. It was the main church of the parish of Forchheim, as well as Mörsch and Daxlanden (a city district that nowadays belongs to Karlsruhe). The parish church was under the patronage of Weissenburg Abbey and later the &#x27;Schenken von Schüpf&#x27; family. Via the Counts of Zweibrücken, the diocese of Speyer became the patron of Rheinstetten. Because Mörsch and Forchheim had political bonds to Baden-Baden, which did not take part in the reformation, they stayed Catholic. Neuburgweier had been reformed due to its religious affiliation to the Palatinate region, but during the French occupation this was changed back.

Mörsch has had its own parish administration since the high-medieval period. The right of patronage first belonged to the Counts of Eberstein then in 1567 the Margraves of Baden became the patrons. Since the 15th century Neuburgweier has belonged to the parish of Mörsch. In the 17th century the parishes of Forchheim and Mörsch (aloing with Neuburgweier) were merged, but in 1907 this merger was undone. Until 1962 Neuburgweier belonged to Mörsch and then became its own parish.

The contemporary parish church of Forchheim was constructed by Johannes Ludwig Weinbrenner in 1857/1858. The forest chapel &quot;Maria Hilf&quot;, which was built in 1950/51 and is situated in the village Silberstreifen, also belongs to the parish of Forchheim. The parish church in Mörsch, which is shaped like an early Christian Basilika, was built in 1846/47. The St. Ursula Chapel of Neuburgweier was first mentioned in 1495. In 1776 the nave was replaced and in 1871 the chapel was expanded and renovated in a neo-Gothic style. In 1952 the contemporary Catholic church St. Ursula was built. Since 18 September 2005 the three Catholic parishes together have constituted the Catholic pastoral care unit of Rheinstetten. Until 2008 it belonged to the deanery of Ettlingen. Since the reformation of deaneries, it belongs to the deanery of Karlsruhe of the archdiocese of Freiburg.

The priest Anton Fränznick, who was killed in the Dachau concentration camp because of his role in the resistance movement, worked in the 1920s and 30s in Mörsch.

After the second world war, Protestants also moved to Rheinstetten. Initially they were cared for by the neighbouring municipality of Durmersheim, which lies to the south of Rheinstetten. On 1 January 1971 the Protestant parish of Forchheim was established. Three years later this parish was assigned to the church district &#x27;Alb-Pfinz&#x27; and renamed Rheinstetten. In 1979 a second rectorate for the districts Mörsch and Neuburgweier was established and in 1984 they established their own parish. The Protestant parish house in Forchheim was built in 1972. In 1981 Mörsch built their Protestant parish house. In Neuburgweier the Protestants obtained the old St. Ursula chapel in 1954, after the new construction of the Catholic St. Ursula church.

<text>Gough Island ( ), also known historically as Gonçalo Álvares, is a rugged volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a dependency of Tristan da Cunha and part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It is approximately south-east of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago (which includes Nightingale Island and Inaccessible Island), north-east from South Georgia Island, west from Cape Town, and over from the nearest point of South America.

Gough Island is uninhabited, except for the personnel of a weather station (usually six people) that the South African National Antarctic Programme has maintained, with British permission, continually on the island since 1956. It is one of the most remote places with a constant human presence. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of &quot;Gough and Inaccessible Island&quot;. It is one of the most important seabird colonies in the world.

==Name==
The island was first named &quot;Ilha de Gonçalo Álvares&quot; on Portuguese maps. Gonçalo Álvares was a Portuguese explorer who discovered the island in 1505. Confusion of the unusual Portuguese saint name Gonçalo with Spanish Diego led to the misnomer Diego Alvarez Island in English-language sources from the 1800s to 1930s. However, the most likely explanation is that it was simply a misreading of &quot;Is. de Go. Alvarez&quot;, the name by which the island is represented on some of the early charts, the &quot;de Go&quot; mutating into &quot;Diego&quot;.

The name &quot;Gough island&quot; refers to the British mariner Captain Charles Gough of the &quot;Richmond&quot;, who sighted the island in 1732.

==History==
The details of the discovery of Gough Island are unclear, but the most likely occasion is July 1505 by the Portuguese explorer Gonçalo Álvares. Maps during the next three centuries named the island after him. On some later maps, this was erroneously given as Diego Alvarez.

According to some historians, the British merchant Anthony de la Roché was the first to land on the island, in the austral autumn of 1675.

Charles Gough rediscovered the island on 3 March 1732, thinking it was a new find. It had been named Gonçalo Álvares since 1505 after the captain of Vasco da Gama&#x27;s flagship on his epic voyage to the east, and under this name, it was marked with reasonable accuracy on the charts of the South Atlantic during the following 230 or so years. Then, in 1732, Captain Gough of the British ship &quot;Richmond&quot; reported the discovery of a new island, which he placed to the east of Gonçalo Álvares. Fifty years later, cartographers realised that the two islands were the same, and despite the priority of the Portuguese discovery, and the greater accuracy of the position given by them, &quot;Gough&#x27;s Island&quot; was the name adopted. It is still known by its old name &quot;Ilha de Gonçalo Álvares&quot; in Portuguese, though Portugal lays no claim to any of the islands in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago.

In the early 19th century, sealers sometimes briefly inhabited the island. The earliest known example is a sealing gang from the U.S. ship &quot;Rambler&quot; (Captain Joseph Bowditch) which remained on the island in the 1804–1805 season. The sealing era lasted from 1804 to 1910 during which 34 sealing vessels are known to have visited the island, one of which was lost offshore.

The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition on the &quot;Scotia&quot; made the first visit to the island by a scientific party on 21 April 1904, when William Speirs Bruce and others collected specimens. The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition also stopped at the island in 1922. There was a brief period of human occupation for two years from 1936 to 1938 when farming was done to hunt for birds, their eggs, and to extract driftwood, guano and apples. The 1955 Gough Expedition mapped out the internal geography of the island and also studied its biota over several months.

Gough Island was formally claimed in 1938 for the United Kingdom, during a visit by of the Royal Navy.

In 1995, the island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2004, the site was extended to include Inaccessible Island, and the marine zone of Gough Island was extended from . The site was renamed Gough and Inaccessible Islands. The selection criteria for the site do not include its geomorphic interest. As it happens, Gough and Inaccessible Islands are included in a possible &quot;serial trans-boundary nomination&quot; for the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which would include other volcanic sites in the Atlantic.

Gough Island is the only land outside South America from which the solar eclipse of 12 September 2034 (excluding partial phases), will be visible; the centre of the path of totality crosses over the island.

==Geography and geology==
One of the most remote islands in the world, Gough Island is in the South Atlantic Ocean. While the central part of the island is a plateau, the western part has a highland with the peaks and cliffs rising over 350 metres. Gough Island is roughly rectangular with a length of and a width of . It has an area of and rises to a highest point over above sea level. Glens cut deep into the inland mountains from the northern and eastern sides. Geological formations on the island are of volcanic origin.

Topographic features include its highest peak, Edinburgh Peak (), as well as Hags Tooth, Mount Rowett, Sea Elephant Bay, Quest Bay, and Hawkins Bay.

Surrounding Gough are small satellite islands and rocks, such as Southwest Island, Saddle Island (to the South), Tristiana Rock, Isolda Rock (West), Round Island, Cone Island, Lot&#x27;s Wife, Church Rock (North), Penguin Island (Northeast), and The Admirals (East).

The average temperature is while the average rainfall is . Snow falls in the highlands in winter.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen system, Gough Island features an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Gough Island&#x27;s maximum temperatures are between and during the day year-round, due to its isolated position far out in the South Atlantic. As a result, summers are never hot and are highly susceptible to cold fronts. The Atlantic is much cooler in the southern hemisphere than in the northern, but frosts are still very rare due to heavy cloud cover. Precipitation is high throughout the year, and sunshine hours are few. Snow frequently falls on the peaks and plateau all year round (with occurrences of summer snow on the 900-metre peaks), but is uncommon at sea-level.

==Fauna and flora==
Gough and Inaccessible Island are a protected wildlife reserve, which has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It has been described as one of the least disrupted ecosystems of its kind and one of the best shelters for nesting seabirds in the Atlantic. In particular, it is host to almost the entire world population of the Tristan albatross (&quot;Diomedea dabbenena&quot;) and the Atlantic petrel (&quot;Pterodroma incerta&quot;). The island is also home to the almost flightless Gough moorhen, and the critically endangered Gough bunting.

===Birds===

The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for its endemic landbirds and as a breeding site for seabirds. Birds for which the IBA has conservation significance include northern rockhopper penguins (30,000 breeding pairs), Tristan albatrosses (1,500–2,000 pairs), sooty albatrosses (5,000 pairs), Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses (5,000 pairs), broad-billed prions (1,750,000 pairs), Kerguelen petrels (20,000 pairs), soft-plumaged petrels (400,000 pairs), Atlantic petrels (900,000 pairs), great-winged petrels (5,000 pairs), grey petrels (10,000 pairs), great shearwaters (100,000 pairs), little shearwaters (10,000 pairs), grey-backed storm petrels (10,000 pairs), white-faced storm petrels (10,000 pairs), white-bellied storm petrels (10,000 pairs), Antarctic terns (500 pairs), southern skuas (500 pairs), Gough moorhens (2,500 pairs), and Gough buntings (3,000 individuals).

===Mammals===

The island has a large breeding population of subantarctic fur seals, and some southern right whales still migrate around the island.

House mice are currently present on the island (see Invasive Species).

===Invasive species===

====Pearlwort (&quot;Sagina procumbens&quot;)====
In 1998, a number of procumbent pearlwort (&quot;Sagina procumbens&quot;) plants were found on the island which are capable of dramatically transforming the upland plant ecosystem (as it has on the Prince Edward Islands). Eradication efforts are ongoing but are expected to require years of &#x27;concerted effort&#x27;.

====House mice====
In April 2007, researchers published evidence that predation by introduced house mice on seabird chicks is occurring at levels that might drive the Tristan albatross and the Atlantic petrel to extinction. As of October 2018, it is estimated that as many as 2,000,000 fewer eggs and chicks are being raised due to the impact of mice on the island, threatening the extinction of several species of seabirds that breed exclusively or nearly exclusively on Gough Island. 

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) awarded £62,000 by the UK government&#x27;s Overseas Territories Environment Programme to fund additional research on the Gough Island mice and a feasibility study of how best to deal with them. This grant also paid for the assessment of a rat problem on Tristan da Cunha island. Trials for a method of eradicating the mice through baiting were commenced, and ultimately a £9.2 million eradication programme was planned, set to begin in 2020, with the island expected to be mouse-free by 2022. However, the start date was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme used helicopters to drop cereal pellets containing the rodenticide brodifacoum. Gough has also been identified as the third-most important island in the world (out of 107 islands) to be targeted for the removal of non-native invasive mammals in order to save threatened species from extinction and to make major progress towards achieving global conservation targets. The proposed cull was criticised by the director of Animal Aid, stating, &quot;We don’t feel we have the right to choose some animals over others ... We don’t agree with any culling for so-called conservation purposes. The conservation priority should be making sure wild spaces are protected, but allowing nature to do its thing.&quot;

As of December 2021, the head of the project to cull the population of mice considers this to have been a failure, since a living mouse was spotted after the completion of the project, which implied that there are other mice still alive on Gough. Nevertheless, the RSPB is planning a future restoration attempt by applying rodenticide bait, after doing some research to improve this operation.

==Weather station==

A weather station has been operating on Gough Island since 1956. It is operated as part of the network of the South African Weather Service. Because cold fronts approach South Africa from the south-west, the Gough station is particularly important in forecasting winter weather. Initially it was housed in the station at The Glen, but moved in 1963 to the South lowlands of the island, more precisely . The new location improved the validity and reliability of the data acquired for use in modelling.

===Human presence===
Each year, a new overwintering team arrives by ship from Cape Town (beginning in 2012, the &quot;S. A. Agulhas II&quot;) to staff the weather station and perform scientific research. The team for a particular year may be termed as &quot;Gough&quot; and an expedition number: For example, the 1956 team was designated &quot;Gough 01&quot;, and the team for 2013 was &quot;Gough 58&quot;. Each new team directly replaces the departing one, thereby maintaining a continual human presence on the island.

A team normally consists of:
*A senior meteorologist
*Two junior meteorologists
*A radio technician
*A medic
*A diesel mechanic
*A number of biologists (depending on ongoing research projects)

The team is supplied with enough food to last the whole year. People and cargo are landed either by helicopter, from a helideck-equipped supply ship, or by a fixed crane atop a cliff near the station (a place aptly called &quot;Crane Point&quot;).

On 11 February 2014, a member of the research team choked to death on the island and his body was taken back to South Africa.

<text>Pockau is a village and a former municipality in the district of Erzgebirgskreis in Saxony, Germany. On 1 January 2014 it was merged with the town Lengefeld to form the town Pockau-Lengefeld. Pockau is on the Silver Road (&quot;Silberstraße&quot;).

==Geography==
Originally a forest village (&quot;Waldhufendorf&quot;), Pockau is located in the valley of the Flöha at its confluence with the Black Pockau. To the north lie the one-time forest villages of Görsdorf und Forchheim, the latter in the valley of the Haselbach. To the east, in the Flöha valley, lie Wernsdorf and the settlement of Nennigmühle. To the west is the settlement of Marterbüschel. The highest point in the former municipality of Pockau is the Brandhübel, at a height of ; the lowest point is the Flöha valley at around . The Saidenbach Dam is northeast of Pockau.

Kinesics was first used in 1952 by an anthropologist named Ray Birdwhistell. Birdwhistell wished to study how people communicate through posture, gesture, stance and movement. His ideas over several decades were synthesized and resulted in the book &quot;Kinesics and Context.&quot; Interest in kinesics specifically and nonverbal behaviour generally was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by such popular mass-market (nonacademic) publications as &quot;How to Read a Person Like a Book&quot;. Part of Birdwhistell&#x27;s work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show elements of communication that were not seen otherwise. One of his most important projects was &quot;The Natural History of an Interview,&quot; a long-term interdisciplinary collaboration including Gregory Bateson, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Norman A. McQuown, Henry W. Brosin and others.

Drawing heavily on descriptive linguistics, Birdwhistell argued that all movements of the body have meaning and that nonverbal behaviour has a grammar that can be analyzed in similar terms to spoken language. Thus, a &quot;kineme&quot; is &quot;similar to a phoneme because it consists of a group of movements which are not identical, but which may be used interchangeably without affecting social meaning.&quot;

Birdwhistell estimated that no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words. He also concluded that there were no universals in these kinesic displays, a claim that was disputed by Paul Ekman, who was interested in analysis of universals, especially in facial expression.

==Modern applications==
In a current application, kinesic behavior is sometimes used as signs of deception by interviewers looking for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered, although kinesics can be equally applied in any context and type of setting to construe innocuous messages whose carriers are indolent or unable to express verbally.

Relevant concepts include:
*Emblems - Body movements or gestures that are directly translatable into a word or phrase
*Illustrators - Accompany or reinforce verbal messages
**Batons - Temporally accent or emphasize words or phrases
**Ideographs - Trace the paths of mental journeys
**Deictic movements - Point to a present object
**Kinetographs - Depict a bodily action
**Spatial movements - Depict a spatial relationship
**Pictographs - Draw a picture of their referent
**Rhythmic movements - Depict the rhythm or pacing of an event
*Affect Displays - Show emotion
*Regulators - Control the flow and pace of communication
*Manipulators - Release physical or emotional tension

Kinesic behaviors are an important part of nonverbal communication. Body movements convey information, but interpretations vary by culture. As many movements are carried out at a subconscious or at least a low-awareness level, kinesic movements carry a significant risk of being misinterpreted in an intercultural communication situation.

<text>Waterloo Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall and connected to Princes Half Tide Dock to the south. The site of Victoria Dock is located to the north.

==History==
The dock was designed by Jesse Hartley and opened in 1834 as Waterloo Dock, named after the Battle of Waterloo. 

In 1843 an observatory was built here for astronomical and meteorological observations and to provide accurate time for ships&#x27; chronometers.

In 1866, when the dock was redeveloped, the observatory was relocated to Bidston Hill on the Wirral Peninsula.

In 1868, Waterloo Dock was split in two separate basins; East Waterloo Dock and West Waterloo Dock. 

Initially planned eleven years earlier, the lock entrance from the Mersey was finally opened in 1949. Construction was delayed due to the Second World War.

The dock closed to shipping in 1988. The entrance channel from the river and part of the dock has since been filled.

In 2007, work began on a £20 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further of navigable waterway and encompassing Princes Half Tide Dock. 
A new -wide channel from Trafalgar Dock to the northern end of West Waterloo Dock will be excavated as part of the canal route. 

The extensive Waterloo Warehouse has since been converted into residential apartments.

<text>Prince&#x27;s Half-Tide Dock on the River Mersey, England, is a half tide dock and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall, connected to East Waterloo Dock and West Waterloo Dock to the north and Prince&#x27;s Dock to the south.

==History==
The dock opened in 1810 and consisted of a lock entrance from the Mersey. This passage has since been closed off. The dock was rebuilt in 1868 by George Fosbery Lyster.

In 2007, work began on a £20 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further of navigable waterway and encompassing Prince&#x27;s Half-Tide Dock. A new lock, and fixed bridge, was built at the entrance to the adjoining Prince&#x27;s Dock. The dock was partly filled in to reduce its depth.

==Future==
The area surrounding Prince&#x27;s Half-Tide Dock forms part of the proposed multi-billion pound Liverpool Waters development; a series of towers is planned to be built around the dock.

Prince&#x27;s Half-Tide Dock is the proposed location of the new £3.5 million Isle of Man Steam Packet Company ferry terminal, which will replace the existing facility at Pier Head, which is &quot;nearing the end of its operational life&quot; according to the report placed before Tynwald (the Isle of Man parliament). The proposals were discussed before Tynwald on 19 July 2016.

<doc id="1136493" wikidata="Q3355092" url="?curid=1136493" title="Pipe cleaner">
<text>A pipe cleaner or chenille stem or furry wire is a type of brush originally intended for removing moisture and residue from smoking pipes. They can also be used for any application that calls for cleaning out small bores or tight places. Special pipe cleaners are manufactured specifically for cleaning out medical apparatus and for engineering applications.

Outside of their originally intended purpose, they are commonly used in crafts, and are also popular for winding around bottle necks to catch drips, bundling things together, as a twist tie, colour-coding, and as a makeshift brush for applying paints, oils, solvents, greases, and similar substances.

==Description==
Smoking pipe cleaners normally use some absorbent material, usually cotton or sometimes viscose. Bristles of stiffer material, normally monofilament nylon or polypropylene are sometimes added to better scrub out what is being cleaned. Microfilament polyester is used in some technical pipe cleaners because polyester wicks liquid away rather than absorbing it as cotton does. Some smoking pipe cleaners are made conical or tapered so that one end is thick and one end thin. The thin end is for cleaning the small bore of the pipe stem and then the thick end for the bowl or the wider part of the stem. When used for cleaning purposes, pipe cleaners are normally discarded after one or two uses.

==History== 
Pipe cleaners were invented by John Harry Stedman and Charles Angel in Rochester, New York in the early 1900s, later to be sold on to BJ Long Company, with a possibly parallel invention by Johan Petter Johansson 1923.

==Crafts==
Pipe cleaners are commonly used in arts and crafts projects. Craft pipe cleaners are usually made with polyester or nylon pile and are often longer and thicker than the &quot;cleaning&quot; type, and available in many different colors. Craft pipe cleaners are not very useful for cleaning purposes, because the polyester does not absorb liquids, and the thicker versions may not even fit down the stem of a normal pipe or into the usual hard-to-access area of applications that call for cleaning small bores or tight places.

In Japan, crafting with pipe cleaners is known as Mogol art. Its name derived from the Portuguese word Mughal for a style of weaving. Workshops in malls and schools in Japan have been led by Atushi Kitanaka on an effort to support the pipe cleaner industry. Ikuyo Fujita (藤田育代 &quot;Fujita Ikuyo&quot;) is a Japanese artist who works primarily in needle felt painting and mogol (pipe cleaner) art. Use of pipe cleaners as an art format where animals are made by twisting pipe cleaners together. They can also be used to create whiskers for an animal mask or nose.

Craft pipe cleaners are often used in classroom settings for a variety of reasons including creating simple models, creating complex models, or as learning aids for various topics.

==Manufacture==
A pipe cleaner is made of two lengths of wire, called the core, twisted together trapping short lengths of fibre between them, called the pile. Pipe cleaners are usually made two at a time, as the inner wires of each pipe cleaner have the yarn wrapped around them, making a coil, the outer wires trap the wraps of yarn, which are then cut, making the tufts. Chenille yarn is made in much the same way, which is why craft pipe cleaners are often called &quot;chenille stems&quot;. The word &quot;chenille&quot; comes from French meaning &quot;caterpillar&quot;. Some pipe cleaner machines are actually converted chenille machines. Some machines produce very long pipe cleaners which are wound onto spools. The spools may be sold as-is or cut to length depending on the intended use. Other machines cut the pipe cleaners to length as they come off the machines. Smoking pipe cleaners are usually long. Craft ones are often and can be up to . They come in 4 mm, 6 mm, and 15 mm diameter sizes. Jumbo pipe cleaners have a 30 mm diameter with lengths of and .

<doc id="1136499" wikidata="Q4120294" url="?curid=1136499" title="Hundred Days' War">
<text>The Hundred Days War (, &quot;Harb Al-Mia&#x27;at Yaoum,&quot; French: La Guerre des Cent Jours) was a subconflict within the 1977–82 phase of the Lebanese Civil War which occurred in the Lebanese capital Beirut. It was fought between the allied Christian Lebanese Front militias, under the command of the Kataeb Party&#x27;s President Bachir Gemayel, and the Syrian troops of the Arab Deterrent Force (ADF).

==Background==

In January 1976, the Phalange joined the main Christian parties – National Liberal Party (NLP), Lebanese Renewal Party (LRP), Marada Brigade, Al-Tanzim, and others – in a loose coalition, the Lebanese Front, designed to act as a political counterweight to the predominantly Muslim Lebanese National Movement (LNM) – Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) alliance. In order to deal with the Syrian military intervention of June 1976 and better coordinate the military operations of their respective militias, Christian militia leaders agreed to form in August that year a joint military command (a.k.a. the &quot;Command Council&quot;) whose new collective name was the &quot;Lebanese Forces&quot; (LF).
From the very beginning, it became clear that the Lebanese Front&#x27;s Command Council was dominated by the Phalange and its KRF militia under the charismatic leadership of Bachir Gemayel, who sought to unify the various Christian militias. From 1977 onwards, Bachir began implementing the controversial &quot;unification of the rifle&quot; policy, using the LF to build a new power base for himself, distinct from that of the Phalange or any of the other traditional rightist parties. However, Bachir&#x27;s actions soon put him on a direct collision course with Syria. Relations between the LF command and Damascus had already become frosty as a consequence of the ADF&#x27;s growing unwillingness to either suppress the LNM-PLO alliance militias in west Beirut altogether or allow the Christian militias to do so.

==History==
===The Hundred Days&#x27; War===

===1 July 1978===

On this day, Syrian army started a military offensive destined to dislodge the anti-Syrian Lebanese Front leadership from Beirut and the Front&#x27;s strongholds. This move not only began the Lebanese Hundred&#x27;s Days War but a series of confrontation between Lebanese nationalists and Syrian regime and pro-Syrian factions, that continue to this day. 

In this opening act, Syria gathered 15,000 troops around Beirut supported by heavy weaponry, which bombed Lebanese residential areas in the city at a heavy rate reaching sometimes 100 shells per minute. On the other hand, the Lebanese Front united its leadership under Bachir Gemayel and started successive counter operations against Syrian brigades, which Syria responded with further savage bombings determined to seize control of Lebanon at all costs.

The final stage of the war culminated with the humiliating surrender of brigades of Syrian special forces in Beirut after only days of encirclement. This event caused a massive collapse in Syrian moral and its leadership started to question the ability of the army to take Lebanon.

Following this, the USSR rushed to defend Syria by calling a meeting to UN security council on 7th October 1978. The meeting lasted for only 4 minutes and issued resolution 436, forcing an end to the fightings, an end to Syrian so called &quot;de-zionification&quot; operation and recognising the legitimacy of the Lebanese Front as representative of Lebanese Free Zones on international stages.

==Consequences==
However, the LF attack on the pro-Syrian Marada Brigade militia of the Frangieh Clan that summer, which culminated in the infamous Ehden massacre, provoked another round of fighting in June–July. President Elias Sarkis threatened to resign in protest over the Syrian bombardment of East Beirut, but later withdrew his resignation when the shelling stopped.
More fighting erupted in the fall, again followed by a ceasefire. In October 1978, the Foreign Ministers of Lebanon and those Arab League states contributing to the ADF – Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Sudan, Qatar and the UAE – met at the town of Beiteddine, in the Chouf District south-east of Beirut. The outcome of the meeting was essentially a reaffirmation of the role of the ADF and a strong condemnation of those dealing with Israel. This meeting, and subsequent discussions between Syria and Saudi Arabia led to the lifting of the siege of Achrafieh by the Syrians and the withdrawal of all Syrian troops from East Beirut, being replaced by Saudi and Sudanese ADF troops, whom the Lebanese Front leaders viewed as more impartial and less hostile towards the Christians than the Syrian forces. The settlement was welcomed by the Lebanese Front parties and marked the end of the clashes.

<text>André George(s) Louis Onslow (27 July 1784 – 3 October 1853) was a French composer of English descent. His wealth, position and personal tastes allowed him to pursue a path unfamiliar to most of his French contemporaries, more similar to that of his contemporary German romantic composers; his music also had a strong following in Germany and in England. His principal output was chamber music, but he also wrote four symphonies and four operas. Onslow was esteemed by critics of his time, but his reputation declined swiftly after his death. It has only been revived in recent years.

==Life==
George Onslow was born in Clermont-Ferrand to an English father, Edward Onslow, and a French mother, Marie Rosalie de Bourdeilles de Brantôme; his paternal grandfather was George Onslow, 1st Earl of Onslow. In Onslow&#x27;s own brief autobiography (written in the third person) he comments that in his childhood, &quot;music studies formed but a secondary part of his education&quot; but names Jan Ladislav Dussek and Johann Baptist Cramer amongst his piano teachers. It has been suggested that he received this tuition in London under the aegis of his grandfather the Earl. However, other research indicates he may not have studied with Dussek until 1797–1798 in Hamburg, where his family was living in exile after his father had become involved in counter-revolutionary activities in France. This research also indicates that there is no evidence to support the suggestions sometimes made that Onslow at any time visited Vienna, or that he met, or studied, there with Ludwig van Beethoven.

Onslow states in his autobiography that his attitude to music was transformed by his experience of hearing the overture to Étienne Méhul&#x27;s opera &quot;Stratonice&quot; in Paris in 1801. In Onslow&#x27;s own later words: &quot;On hearing this piece, I experienced so lively an emotion in the depths of my soul that I sensed myself at once penetrated by feelings previously unknown to me; even today this moment is present in my thought. After this, I saw music with other eyes; the veil which had hidden its beauties from me was rent; it became the source of my most intimate joy, and the faithful companion of my life.&quot; This led him to compose his first string quintets (Op. 1 nos. 1–3) and string quartets (Op. 4 nos. 1–3), although he had not at this stage received any composition tuition. These were published at his own expense; Onslow was always wealthy and did not need critical or financial support. The critic François-Joseph Fétis noted that, despite his absence of training, Onslow &quot;had all the leisure necessary to overcome these obstacles&quot;. Onslow learnt to play the cello, and would play the chamber music of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven with other local amateurs. However, aware of the need to develop his technical musical skills, in 1808 he began to study composition with Anton Reicha in Paris. At this time he also married a French heiress, Charlotte Françoise Delphine de Fontanges, by whom he was to have three children.

Onslow based himself near Clermont-Ferrand, initially at his father&#x27;s Château de Chalendrat at Mirefleurs (where at the age of six he had planted many of the trees), later at Château de Bellerives at Perignat, La Roche-Noire. He typically visited Paris during the winter (concert) season, when his works were often performed by musicians including the violinists Pierre Baillot and Théophile Tilmant, and the brothers Dancla, who gave quartet concerts. In 1824 and 1827 his first two operas, &quot;L&#x27;Alcalde de la vega&quot; and &quot;Le colporteur&quot;, were premiered at the Théâtre Feydeau in Paris under the auspices of the Opéra-Comique. &quot;Le colporteur&quot; was also produced in Germany, and even (in a very mangled version, in 1831), in London. In 1825 in Paris he met the 16-year-old Felix Mendelssohn, who enjoyed a performance of one of Onslow&#x27;s quartets but was surprised that he was not aware of Beethoven&#x27;s opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;. Onslow was an early enthusiast of the music of Hector Berlioz, whose &quot;Eight scenes from Faust&quot; (1829) and overture &quot;Les francs-juges&quot; (1830) he praised. In 1829, after Onslow had commenced his quintet op. 38 (his fifteenth), he was very seriously wounded in a hunting accident, which left him partially deaf in one ear; completing the quintet in the aftermath, he named the final movements &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Convalescence&quot; and &quot;Recovery&quot;. The work was subtitled &quot;De la Balle&quot; (&quot;The Bullet&quot;).

Throughout the 1820s, Onslow&#x27;s reputation continued to grow both in France and abroad as a series of trios, quartets and quintets were published. Onslow&#x27;s publishers in Paris were Ignaz and Camille Pleyel. In 1818 his works began to be published in Germany by Breitkopf und Härtel and in Austria by C. F. Peters; the same year saw the first writings about his works by German music critics. Other German publishers, including Hoffmeister, Steiner and Simrock, followed in later years. In the 1830s, Onslow&#x27;s quartets were in the repertoire of the Müller Quartet, which played them at the Meiningen court of Duke Bernhard II, and of the Prague-based quartet of Friedrich Pixis the younger.

In 1831 Onslow was elected the second Honorary Fellow of the Philharmonic Society of London (Felix Mendelssohn had been the first). He wrote for the Society his Second Symphony, Op. 42, and continued to maintain close relations with leading London musicians including John Ella and George Frederick Anderson. In 1834, Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt played Onslow&#x27;s Grand Sonata for four hands Op. 22 at their debut joint performance in Paris. From 1835 to 1838 Onslow was the President of the &quot;&quot; in Paris, an association founded in 1829 &quot;to propagate the study and the spirit of music&quot;, with the intention of bringing together both amateurs and professionals. The year 1837 saw the premiere in Paris of Onslow&#x27;s third (and last) opera &quot;Le duc de Guise&quot;. In 1839 Onslow founded the &quot;&quot; in which the émigré Polish violinist Alexandre Tarnowski was very active. Performances were given of Onslow&#x27;s own chamber music, and also of his opera &quot;Guise&quot;, including passages which had been cut from the Paris performances. At the instigation of Tarnowski, Onslow also hosted in Clermont-Ferrand the Polish-Jewish xylophonist and rival of Josef Gusikov, Sankson Jakubowski.

In 1842 Onslow&#x27;s wealth increased on the death of his father-in-law, who owned extensive property. In the same year his French musical prestige was consolidated when he succeeded Luigi Cherubini as a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Invited to the Aachen music festival in 1846, in the following year, on what may have been his last journey outside France, Onslow conducted his Fourth Symphony in Cologne, at the . During his last years he wrote a number of pieces for large chamber ensemble with piano, including quintets, a sextet (Op. 77b) and a septet (Op. 79); he also wrote a nonet (op. 77a) for strings and woodwind. Onslow died unexpectedly (although after a period of declining health) in Clermont-Ferrand in 1853, after taking a morning walk.

Onslow was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1837.

==Music==

Onslow was a prolific composer of chamber music (including 36 string quartets and 34 string quintets). He also wrote 10 piano trios, three performed operas (an early opera, &quot;Les deux oncles&quot;, remains in manuscript) and four symphonies, apart from various works for solo piano, piano duet, and sonatas for solo strings and piano. Of his string quintets, the first three (Op. 1) were written for two violins, two violas and cello, as with the quintets of Mozart. The remainder were nearly all written for two violins, one viola, and two cellos. After hearing the virtuoso double-bassist Domenico Dragonetti step in to play in a performance of his tenth quintet, Onslow began to provide in his subsequent quintets the option of replacing one of the cellos with a double-bass.

Onslow&#x27;s emphasis on instrumental music, and his base in Clermont-Ferrand, set him apart from many French composers of his era, for whom opera was a principal aspiration – the period after 1830, in particular, was a time when Paris led the world in grand opera. His interest in chamber ensembles and forms seemed to align him more closely with German musical traditions. Moreover, being possessed of an independent fortune, he could write for himself rather than needing to pander to the desires of audiences or impresarios. Fétis complained in 1830: &quot;Nature worked in vain to have a Haydn or a Beethoven born in France; such talent was better concealed in the capital than are diamonds deep in the earth. It was the same with chamber music such as quartets and quintets. If M. Onslow has been able to establish a fine reputation in this genre, it is because his social position renders him independent...he is still better known abroad than in France. The lack of encouragement for instrumental music, a taste for futilities, and other secondary causes which it would be too tedious to detail, have left us insensible to anything but fantasies, variations and other trivia.&quot;

Such comments enabled Onslow&#x27;s publisher Camille Pleyel, in the same year, to promote the composer as &quot;&quot; (&quot;our French Beethoven&quot;), an epithet which was to be frequently repeated by critics, and was also a trigger for rebuttal by those not so convinced of the similarity; as for example Paul Scudo who wrote in 1854 that to compare Onslow with Beethoven was like comparing Casimir Delavigne (a popular librettist of the time) with Shakespeare. Indeed Onslow himself would have disowned comparison with Beethoven&#x27;s late style, according to his conversation as recorded by the music journalist Joseph d&#x27;Ortigue: &quot;The last quartets of Beethoven are mistakes, absurdities, the reveries of a sick genius...I would burn everything I have composed if I someday wrote anything resembling such chaos.&quot; However Onslow&#x27;s interest in classical forms and counterpoint, and the styles of emotional expressiveness in his music, place his music close to the works of his teacher Reicha, and to Onslow&#x27;s German and Austrian contemporaries of early Romantic music, such as Moscheles, Hummel, and Schubert. In the opinion of Robert Schumann, only Onslow and Mendelssohn approached Beethoven&#x27;s mastery of the quartet form.

In the years after his death, Onslow&#x27;s reputation progressively declined. When Richard Wagner was conducting the overture to the opera &quot;L&#x27;Alcalde de la Vega&quot; in London for the Philharmonic Society in 1855, he found it &quot;trivial&quot; and threatened to quit his contract for the rest of the Society&#x27;s concert series. However, from the late twentieth century onwards, commercial recordings of his music began to appear.

<text>Carn Marth () is the name of a hill in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, near Redruth. It is high, and is well known for the granite quarried from it in the past. The name of the hill comes from the Cornish language words &quot;karn&quot; (cairn) and &quot;margh&quot;, meaning &#x27;horse&#x27;.

==Geography and history==
Carn Marth lies southeast of Redruth and is part of the Carnmenellis granite plateau, the &#x27;Carnmenellis Granite&#x27;, one of several granite plutons in Cornwall that make up part of the Cornubian batholith (see also Geology of Cornwall).

In prehistoric times men settled on the uplands as they had many advantages over the more densely vegetated lowlands. From the late Stone Age they have been natural places of refuge; offering easily defended bases and view points over what was the densely wooded landscape of prehistoric Britain. In early modern times they have been perfect sites to mark victories and celebrations, and to host warning beacons of impending attack such as the feared Spanish invasion of the 1580s.

The hill can be seen from the hills of Bodmin Moor on a clear day, over : the reverse is also true. One can look back, up to the East past St Agnes Beacon to the hills of the Moor, Rough Tor and Brown Willy, the highest hill in Cornwall at , Carn Marth being lower at . The Celtic Sea and Bristol Channel to the north and the English Channel to the south are both easily seen. Those with keen sight or binoculars will be able to pick out St Anthony&#x27;s Light at the entrance to Carrick Roads with Pendennis Castle and Falmouth opposite. Turning further west there is the glint of light on the reservoir at Stithians, then more hills, Carnmenellis and Carn Brea, with views across the Great Flat Lode and its attendant engine houses making such poignant relics of the great age of mining.

==Ecology==
The topmost parts of the Carn are clothed in lowland heath, gorse, bracken and a generous mixture of wild flowers. As one would expect this makes for an equally rich population of insects and in turn, as one moves up the food chain, there are small mammals, reptiles and amphibians and then birds being among the most visible. Cuckoos, warblers, swallows drinking on the wing in the flooded quarries, falcons soaring overhead may be seen. Lower down there are fields for grazing, their limits marked by Cornish Hedges. The Carnmarth Trust exists to care for the area.

==Other things by the same name==
Carnmarth North and Carnmarth South are deaneries of the Diocese of Truro: Carnmarth Deanery was established in 1875, the division into North and South is 20th-century. There is a song called &quot;Carn Marth&quot; on &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot;, by Cornish electronic musician Aphex Twin.

<doc id="1136511" wikidata="Q3048258" url="?curid=1136511" title="Hurricane David">
<text>Hurricane David was a devastating tropical cyclone which significantly damaged and killed many people in Dominica and the Dominican Republic in August 1979, and was the most intense hurricane to make landfall in the country in recorded history. A long-lived Cape Verde hurricane, David was the fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season. David formed on August 25, in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean near Cape Verde off the coast of West Africa. Two days later, the storm reached hurricane strength, then underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a Category 5 hurricane and reaching peak sustained winds of on August 28. By the time the system dissipated on September 8, it had traversed the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, The Bahamas, the East Coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada.

David was the first hurricane to affect the Lesser Antilles since Hurricane Inez in 1966. With winds of , David was one of only 2 storms of Category 5 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century, the other also being Inez, and the deadliest since the 1930 San Zenón hurricane, killing over 2,000 people in its path. In addition, David was the deadliest tropical cyclone to hit the island of Dominica since the 1834 Padre Ruíz hurricane, which killed over 200 people.

== Meteorological history ==

On August 25, the US National Hurricane Center reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of disturbed weather, which was located about to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. During that day the depression gradually developed further as it moved westwards, under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure that was located to the north of the system before during the next day the NHC reported that the system had become a tropical storm and named it David. Becoming a hurricane on August 27, it moved west-northwestward before entering a period of rapid intensification which brought it to an intensity of on August 28. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane ravaged the tiny windward Island of Dominica on the following day. David continued west-northwest, and intensified into a Category 5 hurricane in the northeast Caribbean Sea, reaching peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and minimum central pressure of on August 30. An upper-level trough pulled David northward into Hispaniola as a Category 5 hurricane on the August 31. The eye passed almost directly over Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. David crossed over the island and emerged as a weak hurricane after drenching the islands.
After crossing the Windward Passage, David struck eastern Cuba as a minimal hurricane on September 1. It weakened to a tropical storm over land, but quickly re-strengthened as it again reached open waters. David turned to the northwest along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and re-intensified to a Category 2 hurricane while over the Bahamas, where it caused heavy damage. Despite initial forecasts of a projected landfall in Miami, Florida, the hurricane turned to the north-northwest just before landfall to strike near West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 3. It paralleled the Florida coastline just inland until emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at New Smyrna Beach, Florida, later on September 3. David continued to the north-northwest, and made its final landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, as a minimal hurricane with winds on September 5. It turned to the northeast while weakening over land, and became extratropical on September 6 over New York. As an extratropical storm, David continued to the northeast over New England and the Canadian Maritimes. David intensified once more as it crossed the far north Atlantic, clipping northwestern Iceland before moving eastward well north of the Faroe Islands on September 10.

==Preparations==
In the days prior to hitting Dominica, David was originally expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the hurricane to make a direct hit on the southern part of Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency among much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.

Some 400,000 people evacuated in the United States in anticipation of David, including 300,000 people in southeastern Florida due to a predicted landfall between the Florida Keys and Palm Beach. Of those, 78,000 fled to shelters, while others either stayed at a friend&#x27;s house further inland or traveled northward. Making landfall during Labor Day weekend, David forced the cancellations of many activities in the greater Miami area.

== Impact ==
David is believed to have been responsible for 2,078 deaths, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes of the modern era. It caused torrential damage across its path, most of which occurred in the Dominican Republic where the hurricane made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.

=== Lesser Antilles ===

Aside from Dominica, other islands in the Lesser Antilles experienced minor to moderate damage. Just to the south of Dominica, David brought Martinique winds of up to sustained gust in the northeast of the coast of the Caravelle. The capital, Fort-de-France, reported wave heights of and experienced strong tropical storm sustained winds at and gust at . David&#x27;s strong winds caused severe crop damage, mostly to bananas, amounting to $50 million in losses. Though no deaths were reported, the hurricane caused 20 to 30 injuries and left 500 homeless.

Guadeloupe experienced moderate to extensive damage on Basse-Terre Island. There, the banana crop was completely destroyed, and combined with other losses, crop damage amounted to $100 million. David caused no deaths, a few injuries, and left several hundred homeless. Nearby, Marie-Galante and Les Saintes reported some extreme damage while Grande-Terre had some moderate damages.

The island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands experienced significant rainfall amounting to , but fairly minor flooding.

==== Dominica ====
During the storm&#x27;s onslaught, David dropped up to of rain, causing numerous landslides on the mountainous island. Hours of hurricane-force winds severely eroded the coastlines and washed out coastal roads.

Damage was greatest in the southwest portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm&#x27;s passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood) on the island, leaving 75 percent of the population homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.

Most severely damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 percent of the crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David&#x27;s winds uprooted many trees on the tops of mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.

In all, 56 people died in Dominica and 180 were injured. Property and agricultural damage figures in Dominica are unknown.

=== Puerto Rico ===
Though it did not hit Puerto Rico, Hurricane David passed less than south of the island, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. Portions of southwestern Puerto Rico experienced sustained winds of up to , while the rest of the island received tropical storm-force winds. While passing by the island, the hurricane caused strong seas and torrential rainfall, amounting to in Mayagüez and up to in the central mountainous region.

Despite remaining offshore, most of the island felt David&#x27;s effects. Agricultural damage was severe, and combined with property damage, the hurricane was responsible for $70 million in losses. Following the storm, the FEMA declared the island a disaster area. In all, Hurricane David killed seven people in Puerto Rico, four of which resulted from electrocutions.

=== Dominican Republic ===
Upon making landfall in the Dominican Republic, David turned unexpectedly to the northwest, causing winds in Santo Domingo and Category 5 winds elsewhere in the country. The storm caused torrential rainfall, resulting in extreme river flooding. The flooding swept away entire villages and isolated communities during the storm&#x27;s onslaught. A rail-mounted container crane collapsed in Rio Haina at the sea-land terminal. Many roads in the country were either damaged or destroyed from the heavy rainfall, especially in the towns of Jarabacoa, San Cristobal, and Baní.

Nearly 70% of the country&#x27;s crops were destroyed from the torrential flooding. Extreme river flooding resulted in most of the country&#x27;s 2,000 fatalities. One particularly deadly example of this was when a rampaging river in the mountainous village of Padre las Casas swept away a church and a school, killing several hundred people who were sheltering there. The flooding destroyed thousands of houses, leaving over 200,000 homeless in the aftermath of the hurricane. President Antonio Guzmán Fernández estimated the combination of agricultural, property, and industrial damage to amount to $1 billion.

Neighboring Haiti experienced very little from David, due to the hurricane&#x27;s weakened state upon moving through the country.

=== Bahamas ===
While passing through the Bahamas, David brought winds to Andros Island as the eye crossed the archipelago. David, though still disorganized, produced heavy rainfall in the country peaking at . Strong wind gusts uprooted trees, and overall damage was minimal.

=== United States ===

David produced widespread damage across the United States amounting to $320 million. Prior to the hurricane&#x27;s arrival, 400,000 people evacuated from coastal areas. In total, David directly killed five in the United States, and was responsible for ten indirect deaths.

==== Florida ====
Upon making landfall, David brought a storm surge of only , due to its lack of strengthening and the obtuse angle at which it hit. In addition, David caused strong surf and moderate rainfall, amounting to a maximum of in Vero Beach. Though it made landfall as a Category 2 storm, the strongest winds were localized, and the highest reported wind occurred in Fort Pierce, with sustained and gusts. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million. Two journalists from the Brevard County-based newspaper &quot;TODAY&quot;, reporter Dick Baumbach and photographer Scott Maclay, experienced extremely high winds as they followed the hurricane&#x27;s progress from South Florida to Cocoa.

Because the hurricane remained near the coastline, David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. At the height of the storm, up to 50,000 people in Broward and Miami-Dade County (then Dade County) lost electricity due to downed and damaged power lines. Storm surge and abnormally high tides caused significant erosion damage to State Road A1A in the vicinity of Sunrise Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale. Four fatalities occurred in Broward County, two directly and two indirectly. In Palm Beach County, sustained winds peaked at at the Palm Beach International Airport and wind gusts reached up to in Jupiter. Winds shattered windows in stores near the coast and caused some property damage, including blowing the frame off the Palm Beach Jai alai fronton in Mangonia Park and downing the 186-ft (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. Around 70,000 people in or near West Palm Beach lost electricity after falling trees downed around one-third of Florida Power &amp; Light&#x27;s main feeder lines. Abnormally high tides damaged docks and piers, while also flooding portions of South Ocean Boulevard between Lake Worth and Lantana. In Palm Beach, several boats moored in the Lake Worth Lagoon capsized. Damage in the county totaled approximately $30 million, most of it incurred to crops.

Farther north, the storm deroofed a few structures and flooded some buildings in the Treasure Coast, including the Stuart City Hall. A 450-ft (140-m) crane was snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. In Vero Beach, a tornado caused major damage to a restaurant and deroofed a condominium and apartment building. Some clapboard-style homes in the county suffered major damage, especially in Gifford and other low income communities. Heavy rains inundated portions of State Road 60 with up to of water between Interstate 95 and Yeehaw Junction because the St. Johns River marsh had difficulty draining. Two tornadoes in Brevard County caused damage. The first twister severely impacted or destroyed about 50 mobile homes and a condominium complex in Melbourne Beach and a shopping center in Palm Bay after crossing the Indian River. The shopping center alone sustained about $1.5 million in damage. Another tornado was spawned in Cocoa, damaging a few roofs.

==== Georgia ====
Hurricane David made landfall in Georgia as a quickly weakening minimal hurricane, bringing a storm surge and heavy surf. Its inner core remained away from major cities, though Savannah recorded sustained winds of and wind gusts of . Although no major damage occurred in Savannah, high winds downed numerous power lines, leaving approximately 70,000 electrical customers without power, some for up to two weeks after the storm. Many trees were downed along downtown streets. Tybee Island and its vicinity may have experienced hurricane-force wind gusts. Several homes on the island were partially deroofed. In Darien, the storm severely damaged a nursing home, flooded some streets, and downed tree limbs. Offshore, strong seas disrupted a portion of the coastal reef by moving a sunken ship . Tides produced by the storm also inundated the Jekyll Island Causeway and the F.J. Torras Causeway, which links Brunswick to St. Simons Island. Overall, David was responsible for approximately $5 million in damage in Georgia, much of it in Chatham County, while two people drowned at Jekyll Island due to heavy surf.

==== Rest of the East Coast ====
Upon entering South Carolina, David retained winds of up to hurricane force, though the highest recorded was sustained in Charleston and a wind gust in Hilton Head Island. The storm spawned at least five tornadoes in the state, four of which caused damaged. The first such twister, spawned in Georgetown, demolished five beachfront homes and severely damaged eight other homes and a condominium complex. A tornado touched down in North Myrtle Beach destroyed a few roofs and caused damage to utilities. Minutes later, a second tornado in the city demolished some fishing piers, substantial damaged several dwellings and a motels, and ignited a few fires, which destroyed a condominium complex. A third tornado in North Myrtle Beach caused some degree of roof damage to about 80 percent of oceanfront homes in the Windy Hill Beach section of the city. The twister also demolished three piers and a motel. David caused approximately $10 million in damage in South Carolina.

Similar winds occurred in North Carolina, and lesser readings were recorded throughout the northeastern United States, excluding a wind gust on Mount Washington in New Hampshire. In addition, David dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with widespread reports of over . Storm surge was moderate, peaking at in Charleston and up to along much of the eastern United States coastline.

Overall, damage was light in most areas, though it was very widespread. High winds and rain downed power lines in the New York City area, leaving 2.5 million people without electricity during the storm&#x27;s passage. Had David not taken an unexpected very late turn, it would have likely toppled the Citicorp Building (53rd and Lexington), which was in the process of being fortified because the building could not withstand hurricane-level winds; a major tragedy affecting a square mile of Midtown Manhattan (including Grand Central Station, the UN, and Rockefeller Center), was avoided. David also caused minor to moderate beach erosion, as well as widespread crop damage from the flooding. In addition, the hurricane spawned numerous tornadoes while moving through the Mid-Atlantic and New England, with associated prominent wind damage occurring even in inland communities. In Virginia eight tornadoes formed across the southeastern portion of the state, of which six were F2&#x27;s or greater on the Fujita scale, including two rated F3 in Fairfax County and Newport News. The tornadoes caused 1 death, 19 injuries, damaged 270 homes, and destroyed 3 homes, amounting to $6 million in damage. In Maryland, David&#x27;s outer bands formed seven tornadoes, including an F2 in Kingsville. In New Castle County, Delaware, an F2 tornado damaged numerous homes and injured five.

==Aftermath==

===Dominica===
Immediately after the storm, lack of power prevented communications and the outside world had little knowledge of the extent of the damage in Dominica. A citizen named Fred White ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world.

In response to the severe agricultural damage, the government initiated a food ration. By two months after the storm, assistance pledges amounted to over $37 million from various groups around the world. Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material, or lack thereof, for the affected citizens. The Hurricane destroyed some important landmarks, including a significant part of the ruins of the Fort Young which had stood since the 1770s.

Looting was practiced in supermarkets, seaports, and homes; what was not destroyed by the hurricanes was stolen in the weeks after the storm.

The destroyer was on its way back to the United Kingdom when the hurricane struck, and was turned back to provide emergency aid to the island. Sailing through mountainous seas, &quot;Fife&quot; docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only outside help for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship&#x27;s helicopter (called &quot;Humphrey&quot;) took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance. This was the first time a Royal Navy ship had provided a public broadcast news service.

===Dominican Republic===
Immediately following the storm, more than 200,000 people left homeless sought refuge at churches and public buildings. Tropical Storm Frederic struck the Dominican Republic only about a week after David, exacerbating recovery efforts. In September 1979, the Civil Defense Secretariat of the Dominican Republic provided assistance to approximately 1.8 million people via international organizations such as Care International (CARE), the Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the Church World Service (CWS), and the Peace Corps. Prior to David, these organizations had staged over of P.L. 480 food commodities, which suffered little damage from the storm. CARE and CRS distributed an additional of P.L. 480 food commodities between October 1979 and September 1980. The Civil Defense Secretariat also ordered nearly all privately owned construction equipment be used to clear blocked roadways. Approximately 500,000 sheets galvanized roofing, manufactured locally, was purchased by the government of the Dominican Republic. Within two months, the National Housing Institute and private firms repaired over 12,000 homes. The Secretariat of Agriculture provided assistance with replanting 60–90-day crops. Businesses, non-governmental organizations, and volunteers within the Dominican Republic also contributed significantly, providing construction materials and bedding, clothing, and shoes. Thousands of family-sized food parcels were packed by volunteered and shipped to devastated areas.

The United Nations and intergovernmental organizations, including the European Economic Community, Food and Agriculture Organization, Inter-American Development Bank, Organization of American States, Pan American Health Organization, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund, World Food Programme, and World Bank, provided more than $139.2 million in material and monetary donations.

Cash donations and relief supplies were contributed from Red Cross agencies throughout the world, including from Australia, the Bahamas, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. Additionally France&#x27;s Médecins Sans Frontières and Action d&#x27;urgence internationale and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Oxfam also provided money and supplies. Overall, contributions from these non-governmental organizations totaled nearly $203.13 million.

The United States Congress and president Jimmy Carter approved legislation appropriating $15 million in aid to the Dominican Republic. By 1980, the United States government contributed funds and materials with a monetary value totaling just over $10.1 million. Aside from CARE, CRS, and CWS, non-governmental organizations based in the United States with significant donations of funds and supplies were the American Institute for Free Labor Development, Assemblies of God, Baptist World Alliance, Brother&#x27;s Brother Foundation, Catholic Medical Mission Board, Compassion International, Direct Relief, Lutheran World Relief, MAP International, Michigan Partners of the Americas, Missionary Enterprises, Redemptorists (Baltimore Province), Roman Catholic Episcopate of Puerto Rico, Salesians of St. John Bosco, Salvation Army, Save the Children USA, Seventh-day Adventist World Service, Sister Cities International, Southern Baptist Convention, World Relief, and World Vision International. These organizations combined gave over $2.5 million in aid. Other national governments contributing aid included Argentina, Austria, Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, France, Germany, Haiti, Japan, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.

===United States===
Despite the casualties and damages attributed to David, the storm&#x27;s effects were not as bad as in other countries. In particular, South Florida escaped relatively lightly. Because of this, then NHC Director Neil Frank was accused of overly stirring up panic before the arrival of David. Two local psychiatrists even claimed that the experience would make residents more complacent towards future storms. However, the NHC defended their methods, with Frank stating: &quot;If we hadn&#x27;t [raised public alarm] and our predictions had been more accurate, the consequences would have been disastrous.&quot;
One reporter who covered Hurricane David was Dick Baumbach, a journalist with TODAY newspaper, now known as &quot;Florida Today&quot;. He along with news photographer Scott Maclay followed the path of the hurricane from Miami to Central Florida. In Cocoa Beach, Baumbach decided to ride out the hurricane in his home with two other journalists. While it was a difficult and trying experience, all three reporters survived and ended up winning numerous awards. The hurricane also interrupted the filming of the movie &quot;Caddyshack&quot; that was taking place at the Rolling Hills Country Club in Fort Lauderdale.

===Retirement===

The name &quot;David&quot; was retired following this storm because of its devastation and high death toll; it will never be used again to name a tropical system in the North Atlantic. It was replaced with &quot;Danny&quot; for the 1985 season.

<doc id="1136519" wikidata="Q7244440" url="?curid=1136519" title="Prince's Dock, Liverpool">
<text>Prince&#x27;s Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is the most southerly of the docks situated in the northern part of the Liverpool dock system, connected to Prince&#x27;s Half-Tide Dock to the north. The dock is now in the buffer zone to one of Liverpool&#x27;s World Heritage Sites.

==History==
Initially, William Jessop and John Rennie were consulted about the plans for the dock. The dock was built by John Foster, with construction starting around 1810. During the construction, Foster ordered many times more stone than was needed. Allegedly, Foster diverted it to his family&#x27;s building company. He resigned when this was discovered.

The dock was named for the Prince Regent. Still unfinished, it opened on the day of the Prince Regent&#x27;s coronation as George IV on 19 July 1821. Access to the southern half of the dock system was via George&#x27;s Basin, George&#x27;s Dock and into Canning Dock.

In 1865, the &quot;Mimosa&quot; set sail from Liverpool, containing 153 Welsh settlers destined for Patagonia. It is currently thought that around 50,000 people in Patagonia today have Welsh heritage from the group of 153 settlers. A monument to the settlers was unveiled at Prince&#x27;s Dock in 2015.

In 1874 George&#x27;s Basin was filled, and in 1899 George&#x27;s Dock was filled and the site used to create what is now the Pier Head.

On 12 June 1895 Liverpool Riverside Station was opened, situated between Prince&#x27;s Dock and the River Mersey.

In 1968 B&amp;I Line (operator of the Liverpool - Dublin service) commenced a new car ferry service from Carriers&#x27; Dock further downriver. A passenger only service continued to use Prince&#x27;s Dock until 1969.

Ferry services from Prince&#x27;s Dock finally ended in November 1981 when P&amp;O Ferries closed their Liverpool - Belfast overnight service. The dock subsequently closed to shipping and was partly filled.

==Redevelopment==


Commercial redevelopment began when the dock was passed to the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1988. Much of Prince&#x27;s Dock&#x27;s wharfage and warehouse space has been replaced by:
*Three blocks of office accommodation along the river front.
*The £24 million Malmaison 128-room hotel. It opened in 2007 and is its owning company&#x27;s first ever &#x27;new build&#x27;. It stands alongside the existing Crowne Plaza hotel.
*Three blocks of flats.

The dock was partially filled in to inland canal boat depths precluding deep water vessels. The dock has been divided into two sections spanned by a pedestrian bridge that was designed by the Liverpool John Moores University Centre for Architectural Research and Consultancy Unit (CARCU).

By March 2009 work was completed on a £22 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further 1.4 miles of navigable waterway. 
A new lock and fixed bridge was built at the northern end of Prince&#x27;s Dock. At the south end of the dock, a new canal tunnel was constructed which leads to the Pier Head. The tunnel is routed beneath St. Nicholas Place and the access road for the new cruise liner facility. 
From Prince&#x27;s Dock, the extension passes the Pier Head and terminates at Canning Dock.

In 2007, planning permission was secured for the £130million &quot;New World Square&quot;. This was to have incorporated an eight-storey, five-star hotel, 385 apartments and space for shops and restaurants. However, planning permission for this development expired in 2010.

In 2016, planning permission was granted for the 34-storey Lexington Liverpool.

==Liverpool Cruise Terminal==

Liverpool Cruise Terminal opened in 2007.
As part of their plans to increase the number of visitors to Liverpool, the city council unveiled plans in September 2017 for a new cruise terminal that would be situated on the banks of the Mersey at Prince&#x27;s Dock, where the wooden landing currently stage is. The plans would allow ships carrying up to 3,600 passengers to dock in Liverpool with the facilities including dedicated passport control and a cafe. It is hoped that a multi-storey car park and hotel will be built at Prince&#x27;s Dock as part of the work.

==Cultural references==
Prince&#x27;s Dock is mentioned in the novel &quot;Redburn, His First Voyage&quot; by Herman Melville (1849):

&quot;In magnitude, cost and durability the docks of Liverpool surpass all others in the world... for miles you may walk along that riverside, passing dock after dock, like a chain of immense fortresses.
Prince&#x27;s Dock, of comparatively recent construction, is perhaps the largest of all and is well known to American sailors from the fact that it is mostly frequented by the American shipping.&quot;
It is also mentioned in &quot;The English at the North Pole&quot;, the first part of Jules Verne novel &quot;The Adventures of Captain Hatteras&quot; (1864).

<doc id="1136523" wikidata="Q442200" url="?curid=1136523" title="Wallace H. White">
<text>Wallace Humphrey White Jr. (August 6, 1877March 31, 1952) was an American politician and Republican leader in the United States Congress from 1917 until 1949. White was from the U.S. state of Maine and served in the U.S. House of Representatives before being elected to the U.S. Senate, where he was Senate Minority Leader and later Majority Leader before his retirement.

==Background==
White was born in Lewiston, Maine. His grandfather, William P. Frye, was also a prominent political figure, having served as a Senator from Maine and President pro tempore. In 1899, White graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick. After graduating, he became the assistant clerk to the Senate Committee on Commerce and later secretary to his grandfather. White studied law and was admitted to the bar, afterward beginning to practice in Lewiston.

==Career==
The political career of White began when he was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1916. He took office on March 4 of the following year and served until March 3, 1931 (65th–71st Congresses). He left the House in 1931 after being elected to the Senate in late 1930.

In Congress, White served as chairman of the House Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice (66th Congress), the House Committee on Woman Suffrage (67th through 69th Congresses), the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries (70th and 71st Congresses), and the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (80th Congress). He also served as a presidential appointee on a variety of commissions.

White was reelected in 1936 and 1942 and served from March 4, 1931, to January 3, 1949. He was elected minority leader by his colleagues (1944–1947), and became majority leader when his party held a majority in the 80th Congress (1947–1949). According to John Gunther&#x27;s 1947 book &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, as the titular party floor leader, &quot;his chief function is to hold the balance between two much more dominant and vivid men, Taft and Vandenberg...Everybody likes White; few people pay much attention to him.&quot;

White was one of a handful of senators who voted against the elevation of Hugo Black to the Supreme Court in 1937 based on his previous Klan membership.

He was not a candidate for renomination in 1948. In 1952, White died in Auburn and is interred at the Mt. Auburn Cemetery.

==Family==
White was married twice, first to Anna Pratt of Lewiston in 1903. One son, Herbert Frye White, was born in 1904. In 1914, Anna Pratt White and an infant daughter Helen Hayden White both died in childbirth. In 1917 White married widow Nina Lumbard Lunn. Nina Lunn was the widow of Ralph Lunn and she brought to the marriage a son, Richard Lunn and daughter, Nina Katherine Lunn.

<text>Blacksad is a noir comic series created by Spanish authors Juan Díaz Canales (writer) and Juanjo Guarnido (artist), and published by publisher Dargaud in album format. Though both authors are Spanish, their main target audience for &quot;Blacksad&quot; is the French market and thus they publish all &quot;Blacksad&quot; volumes in French first; the Spanish edition usually follows about one month later. The first volume, &quot;Quelque part entre les ombres&quot; (literally &quot;Somewhere between the Shadows&quot;, but simply called &quot;Blacksad&quot; in the US), was published in November 2000. The second volume, &quot;Arctic-Nation&quot;, was published in 2003 and the third, &quot;Âme Rouge&quot; (&quot;Red Soul&quot;), was published in 2005. An English translation of the third volume was delayed due to the bankruptcy of its North American publisher, iBooks. In 2010, Dark Horse Comics published all three translated volumes as one volume. The publication of this 184-page collection also coincided with the European release of the series&#x27; fourth installment, &quot;L&#x27;Enfer, le silence&quot; (literally &quot;The Hell, the silence&quot;), in September 2010. In 2014, a fifth installment of the series, &quot;Amarillo&quot;, was released in various translations.

The series has been translated into Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian.

Guarnido and Díaz Canales have received several prizes for the series, including three Eisner Award nominations in 2004, two Eisner Award wins in 2013, and an Angoulême Prize for Artwork. A video game adaptation of &quot;Blacksad&quot;, under the name &quot;&quot;, developed by Pendulo Studios, was released in 2019.

==Synopsis==
Rendered in a &quot;film noir&quot; style, the stories are set in late 1950s United States. All of the characters are anthropomorphic animals whose species reflects their personality, character type and role in the story. Animal stereotypes are often used: for example, nearly all of the policemen are canids, such as German Shepherds, Bloodhounds, and foxes, while underworld characters are often reptiles or amphibians. Female characters are often much more human-looking than their male counterparts.

The strip attempts to reflect a dirty, realist outlook and a dark cinematic style through fairly clean, realistic lines. Detailed watercolor drawings, including real-life places and cities, also contribute to the realistic feel of the series, despite the fact that characters are animals. The style of drawing has evolved throughout the series, with later issues displaying sharper, higher-quality colour and fewer grainy lines.

==Cameos==
The series occasionally features anthropomorphic versions of famous people, most notably in &quot;Red Soul&quot;. Adolf Hitler is portrayed as a cat (possibly in homage to Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot;), Senator Joseph McCarthy as Senator Gallo (a rooster), Mark Rothko as Sergei Litvak (a bear), the president as an eagle, and Allen Ginsberg as Greenberg (a bison), while Otto Liebber (an owl) bears a strong resemblance to many of the scientists involved in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos.

==Main characters==
*John Blacksad – hardboiled private investigator. A tuxedo cat was raised in a poor neighborhood and spent much of his youth running from the police. This and his service in World War II likely account for his above-average marksmanship and fighting skills. He also spent a year in college as a history major before being expelled. Like other hardboiled detectives, Blacksad narrates his stories, adding cynical commentary on the evils of the world around him. Unlucky in love, he never seems to be able to form a lasting relationship, often due to circumstances beyond his control. He usually wears a dark suit and trench coat, and uses the alias John H. Blackmore on several fake IDs, including debt collector, FBI agent and customs officer.
*Weekly – Blacksad&#x27;s occasional sidekick. A weasel with has an odor problem, he has a near-constant optimistic attitude, working as a muckraker for a tabloid called the &quot;What&#x27;s News&quot;. His job and size enables him to aid Blacksad gather information by going undercover.
*Smirnov – Police commissioner and friend of Blacksad. A German Shepherd, Smirnov sometimes helps Blacksad to reach the rich and powerful which he himself cannot touch due to &quot;pressure upstairs&quot;. He&#x27;s willing to bend the rules to ensure all criminals are justly punished.

==Volumes==

The first three volumes listed here are released by Dark Horse Comics as a single publication titled simply &quot;Blacksad&quot;.

===&quot;Somewhere Within the Shadows&quot;===
Blacksad investigates the murder of the famous actress Natalia Willford, whom he used to be involved with – first as a bodyguard, then in a more intimate capacity.

Blacksad&#x27;s first inquiries lead him to the screenwriter, Léon Kronski, a lion who is Natalia&#x27;s last known lover, who has disappeared. He finds Kronski already dead and buried under a pseudonym. After Blacksad is severely beaten by two hired thugs, the police arrest him. Smirnov, a police commissioner, explains to Blacksad that because of &quot;pressure upstairs&quot; he himself cannot investigate the matter any further. Smirnov offers him a deal, advantageous to both sides.

As Blacksad returns home, two contact killers consisting in a monitor lizard named Fiston and a rat attempt to kill him. Blacksad shoots the rat, interrogates the dying goanna and finally uncovers the culprit of the whole affair: Ivo Statoc, a cane toad businessman who considers himself above any law. Statoc himself shot the actress because of her infidelity. After brutally infiltrating the office suite at the top of his skyscraper, Blacksad confronts the completely calm and cold-blooded Statoc – who first offers him a job, and then a bribe. Blacksad rejects both offers as a matter of principle and shoots Statoc in the head. The police arrange it so it appears to be a suicide.

===&quot;Arctic Nation&quot;===
This volume deals with inter-racial violence and racial segregation of the 1950s in a pseudo-American suburb called &quot;The Line&quot;. The book also obliquely addresses issues of economic depression, sexual repression and perversion, all intended to expose the social malaise and prejudice that exist beneath the apparently harmonious surfaces of communities.

Observing the aftermath of a lynching on a city street, Blacksad meets his future sidekick, Weekly. Blacksad initially rejects him due to his unpleasant smell and obnoxious behavior. It is revealed that Blacksad is working for an elementary school teacher, Miss Grey, who has asked him to search for a young girl named Kaylie. Miss Grey believes that Kaylie was kidnapped by Arctic Nation, a white supremacist organization. After befriending Weekly, Blacksad is harassed in a bar by three Arctic Nation members. Their leader, Huk the Arctic fox, who turns out to be a close friend of the local police chief Karup the polar bear. Blacksad and Weekly who was taken before Karup.

Blacksad confronts Kaylie&#x27;s mother, Dinah, who has mysteriously failed to report her daughter&#x27;s disappearance. Based on a rumor that he has heard, he suggests that there might have been an affair between herself and the son of Oldsmill, a rich white tiger, but doubts this lead when Dinah takes offense at the insinuation and violently denies it. Blacksad and Weekly cross paths with a violent black power organisation called the Black Claws, which were originally accused of Kaylie&#x27;s abduction. They force Weekly to publish a statement denying their involvement in the kidnapping. Blacksad decides to meet Oldsmill, but discovers that Oldsmill&#x27;s son is mentally disabled and thus unlikely to have had an affair with Dinah.

Meanwhile, Weekly investigates the activities of Karup&#x27;s wife, Jezabel, and discovers that she is having an affair with Huk. She also has an emotional meeting with Dinah, who appears to blackmail Jezabel by threatening to reveal &#x27;what she knows&#x27;. This compounds suspicion on Karup, who is already rumoured to be a pedophile. When Blacksad returns to Dinah&#x27;s apartment, he finds out that she has been murdered. Suspecting Karup of the killing, Blacksad directly confronts him with his suspicions and reveals Jezabel&#x27;s affair with Huk. In consequence, Karup attacks Huk and argues violently with Jezabel; during their tête-à-tête, it comes to light that they have never had sex.

At the violent climax, a magpie called Cotten – who has been complicit in Kaylie&#x27;s abduction against his will – leads Blacksad to an Arctic Nation meeting, located in a derelict war factory. There, Kaylie and Weekly – himself kidnapped by Arctic Nation – are hidden. Blacksad saves Weekly after Huk betrays and hangs Karup, supposedly for kidnapping and child abuse. As the factory burns and Cotten is killed by Huk, Blacksad rescues Kaylie and Weekly. Later, he finds Huk dead in his garage, stabbed in the eye with a screwdriver.

Blacksad corners Jezabel after Karup&#x27;s funeral, proving, through a matching birthmark; that she is Dinah&#x27;s twin sister. Jezabel reveals that Karup was actually their biological father, but had left their black pregnant mother to die after being turned by Oldsmill&#x27;s racist doctrines. Both fueled by revenge, Jezabel ascended white society under a false identity, eventually marrying Karup. With Dinah hired as their maid, Jezabel seduced and manipulated Huk, using him to carry out the fake kidnapping and implicate Karup. However, Huk killed Dinah to ensure her silence, not knowing that she was Jezabel&#x27;s sister, leading Jezabel to kill him in kind.

Blacksad meets with Miss Grey and compliments her on her dedication towards the neighborhood&#x27;s children. After the two say goodbye, Blacksad finds Kaylie sadly staring at him, and he stares back sadly as well. The book concludes by highlighting Kaylie&#x27;s innocence and her ultimate abandonment, but her fate is not made clear.

There are probably some discrepancies between publications. Cotten is also seen as Hewitt, Kayleigh as Kaylie, and some versions of the book end with Blacksad scattering Cotten&#x27;s (Hewitt&#x27;s) ashes to the wind over Las Vegas, fulfilling his last wish.

===&quot;Red Soul&quot;===
During the Red Scare, Blacksad is employed as a bodyguard for a tortoise called Hewitt Mandeline, who goes on a gambling trip to Las Vegas. After returning home, Blacksad&#x27;s last assignment is to accompany him to an art gallery, where he runs into Smirnov and his family. He finds a leaflet for a lecture given by his old school teacher, Otto Liebber a barn owl nuclear physicist and Nobel Prize candidate. Also appearing is the Dalmatian philanthropist Samuel Gotfield, who heads a scientific research foundation; Blacksad takes an instant dislike for Gotfield, who makes a mockery of Otto&#x27;s lecture. He also meets Gotfield&#x27;s fiancée, the writer Alma Mayer.

Gotfield invites Blacksad to a party at his luxurious coastal mansion along with twelve leftist intellectuals: Greenberg, a beat poet; the photographer Dora; the sculptor Klein; the actor Bill Ratcliff; the scriptwriter Jess Logan; the Russian painter Sergei Litvak, a brown bear, the accomplished chemist Laszlo Herzl, a Rhesus monkey and Alma Mayer. After Blacksad grudgingly saves a drunken Gotfield from drowning, with the help of Otto&#x27;s close friend Otero, Herzl angrily accuses Otto of promoting nuclear weapons. When Otero gets back home, he is killed by a gavial assassin named Ribs. It seems he actually meant to kill Otto.

Blacksad and Alma – who plans to spend her honeymoon with Gotfield at Niagara Falls – begin to have feelings for each other. Blacksad decides to follow Otto, saving him from a car bomb planted by the assassin. However, he fails to stop the goon from escaping or a traumatised Otto from leaving the scene. Smirnov informs Blacksad that the assassin is a highly regarded hit man known as Ribs, and that his bomb was chemically complex. Suspecting that Herzl might have hired Ribs, Blacksad confronts him. To his surprise, Herzl is a Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter who shows him photographic proof that Otto used to work for the Third Reich.

Stricken with this new information, Blacksad seeks solace from Alma, only to learn that she has been arrested by the FBI after being inexplicably betrayed by Gotfield. When FBI agents visit Litvak in his studio, they accidentally kill him while using truth serum to ask about Otto&#x27;s whereabouts. Otto, meanwhile, has returned to his old neighborhood – the same neighborhood where Blacksad grew up – only to find it overcome by poverty and his father&#x27;s church a ruin. Suffering a personal crisis, Otto hides at the city aquarium, where Blacksad himself once hid as a child.

Blacksad rescues Alma from the FBI, taking shelter in Weekly&#x27;s apartment. Falling in love with Alma, Blacksad promises to take her to Niagara Falls, which to her is an important act of commitment. Blacksad then finds a fatalistic Otto, who admits that his efforts to reduce the world&#x27;s suffering have only left it worse than before. He also admits to conspiring with Litvak to hand over American nuclear secrets to the Soviets. Blacksad soon realizes that Litvak had copied Otto&#x27;s information onto a canvas and then painted over it as a disguise. When Blacksad goes to the shipyards, he finds out that the painting is bound for an art exhibition in East Berlin. Blacksad manages to re-route the painting to Australia.

As Blacksad prepares to travel to Niagara Falls, the FBI arrests him and plant fake evidence in Litvak&#x27;s death. He is interrogated by the rooster senator Gallo about Otto&#x27;s current location. After he is released, Blacksad confronts a hysterical and disturbed Gotfield, and learns that he betrayed Alma in order to win Senator Gallo&#x27;s patronage and become part of a selected group of people who will be evacuated to a special government shelter in the event of a nuclear war. Finding proof in Gotfield&#x27;s safe, Blacksad uses it to blackmail Senator Gallo into dropping his frame-up. The government fakes Otto&#x27;s death and allows him to leave the country. Blacksad gives the proof to Weekly in a sealed envelope, with instructions to publish the contents if anything happens to him.

Otto writes Blacksad a letter, explaining that he has returned to Germany and is helping rebuild a post-war community. Alma, however, abandons Blacksad after she reads the (fake) story in the newspaper that Liebber committed suicide after Blacksad turned him in. In her mind, Blacksad is now as much a traitor as Gotfield. Blacksad tries to find her again, but she has vanished.

===&quot;A Silent Hell&quot;===
The fourth &quot;Blacksad&quot; album is a murder mystery set in the jazz scene of New Orleans. It has been translated into several European languages and released in the United States by Dark Horse Comics as &quot;Blacksad: A Silent Hell&quot;.

Notably, the story of the album unfolds in non-chronological order. The story alternates between day scenes and night scenes: the night scenes take place during a single night and are the culmination of the story, and the day scenes depict events that took place over several weeks before that night.

Blacksad and Weekly travel to New Orleans to meet Faust LaChapelle, a goat musician who found success signing more talented yet less fortunate musicians to record labels. They learn that LaChapelle has terminal cancer, and is being treated by Ms. Gibraltar, a &quot;vodou&quot; priestess. LaChapelle begs Blacksad to find Sebastian &quot;Little Hand&quot; Fletcher, a Boxer, who – despite having one arm smaller than the other – was the most successful musician he ever signed. Fletcher has gone missing, and LaChapelle is concerned that his addiction to heroin has something to do with it. Blacksad and Weekly accept the case.

The pair soon meet Leeman the hippopotamus, who is the last detective who was hired to find Fletcher. He proposes they all work together, but Blacksad is put off by his reckless driving and alcoholism. Blacksad tracks down and roughs up Fletcher&#x27;s drug dealer, who admits that a masked individual paid him to sell poisoned heroin to Fletcher. Later, Blacksad meets LaChapelle&#x27;s son, Thomas, who has formed a friendship with Fletcher&#x27;s pregnant wife, Hannah. The two get on well until Thomas asks Blacksad to give up the case for his father&#x27;s sake; he believes Fletcher is a bad influence, and his father is wasting his money trying to find him when he could be saving it for his cancer treatment. Disappointed, Blacksad walks out. The conversation does lead him to ponder if Thomas cares for Hannah as more than a friend and may be jealous of Fletcher&#x27;s attentions.

Later, Blacksad finds Thomas and Hannah as she gives birth to Fletcher&#x27;s son. Despite Thomas&#x27; insistence that he leave her alone, he questions her as to her husband&#x27;s whereabouts. Hannah states that Fletcher had been supposed to perform his newest song that night, but that LaChapelle was enraged when he found out. Meanwhile, Weekly discovers that some of Fletcher&#x27;s friends seem to have been mysteriously murdered in staged suicides, causing Blacksad to fear that someone might be after Sebastian&#x27;s life as well.

At a nightclub, Fletcher performs his new song, detailing how he had become congenitally deformed and many others had died due to a carcinogenic flu balm that was being sold in his hometown by the mysterious &quot;Dr. Dupre&quot;, and how bureaucratic payoffs kept Dupre from prison once he was found out. LaChapelle saved them from poverty by signing them all to a successful band. However, the conditions eventually caught up with them, leading them to lives full of addiction and death; now, only Fletcher is left to tell the tale.

Blacksad discovers that Leeman is responsible for killing Fletcher&#x27;s friends, who had planned to blackmail LaChapelle with the truth of what happened in Fletcher&#x27;s hometown. When Blacksad confronts LaChapelle in his house, the latter confesses to being Dupre and admits that he has a rare genetic disorder rather than cancer. He has been investing money in medical research to find a cure, so that his son might one day have healthy children to carry on his legacy. It is also implied that he had the drug dealer poison Fletcher to prevent him from performing the new song that would ruin LaChapelle. Weekly appears and urgently informs Blacksad of Fletcher&#x27;s whereabouts. Blacksad arrives to find that Fletcher has died of the strychnine-laden heroin. It also appears that LaChapelle&#x27;s plans may go in vain as Fletcher was able to perform the new song (though it is unclear whether anyone will connect the story to LaChapelle or not). As for Thomas, he has no interest in his father&#x27;s money nor in having any children, and thus the bloodline will most likely end with him.

Afterwards, Blacksad sees Thomas and Hannah at Fletcher&#x27;s funeral, and they nod to each other in respect. It&#x27;s revealed in his conversation with Weekly that Blacksad gave Thomas their payment for the case; Blacksad says, &quot;he&#x27;ll need it&quot;. It is unknown whether he is referring to Thomas&#x27;s genetic disorder or predicting that LaChapelle&#x27;s deeds will come out in the end.

===&quot;Amarillo&quot;===

The fifth &quot;Blacksad&quot; album is set towards the end of the 1950s. Chad, is a lion writer that travels the road as a vagrant with his on-again-off-again friend Abraham, a bison poet, who appears earlier in the volume titled Red Soul, then referred to simply as &quot;Greenberg&quot;. Abe is extremely volatile towards Chad and his interactions with him lean from harassing to almost sociopathic bullying. Abe views his vocation more romantically than Chad, who sees writing as his career and a means to money, and Abe accuses Chad of not having a true passion like he does. Abe takes his collection of poems he was about to publish and burns them, and encourages the appalled Chad to do the same with his next novel&#x27;s manuscript, to give it a &quot;proper ending&quot;.

Blacksad is happy to be taking a well-earned vacation, staying behind in New Orleans for a while, while Weekly returns home to New York. He lands a side-job when a rich Texan asks him to drive his prized car to Tulsa, Oklahoma where he is flying. Blacksad accepts, enjoying the free road trip. At a pit-stop, two hitch-hikers (who we see are Chad and Abe) steal the prized car and Blacksad, with the help of a street gang, motorcycles after them, hoping to catch them on their way to Amarillo.

Meanwhile, Chad and Abe party with Abe&#x27;s friend, Billy, a flamingo mobster. In front of all of Billy&#x27;s friends, Abe humiliates Chad by saying he is afraid of the cops and has no guts, forcing him to prove it by shooting a shotglass off of Abe&#x27;s head. Chad cannot do it, however, and the entire bar laughs at him. Later on, into the wee hours, Chad, Abe and Billy sit smoking, drinking and talking. Abe drops into the discussion that he has mailed Chad&#x27;s manuscript off to some place in Tibet, and Chad is instantly infuriated—that novel was his ticket out of the vagrant life, and out of relying on Abe to live. Billy and Abe laugh, until Chad finally takes the gun from earlier and shoots Abe out of vengeance. Horrified, Chad flees in Blacksad&#x27;s prized car. He crashes it into a post box, and retrieves his manuscript.

Blacksad parts ways with the bike gang in Amarillo and runs into Neal Beato, a suspicious hyena lawyer while he woos a potential client into suing his boss, a circus owner, for replacing him unlawfully. Overhearing their conversation, Blacksad suggests they are after the same person, and they travel to catch up with the circus where Chad is indeed working. Meanwhile, Chad struggles to fit in, and makes friends with one of the performers, a beautiful and mysterious Siamese cat named Luanne but is warned about becoming close to her by one of the clowns, the massive and imposing Polyphemus, a sun bear. Later that night during a performance, before Luanne is to go out and perform her act, Chad catches Polyphemus attempting to rape Luanne and while they fight, she stabs Polyphemus in the neck. It is an uproar as the circus members apprehend the fleeing Chad and after the show finishes, decide the best way to deal with the tragedy is to abandon Chad and Polyphemus&#x27; body in the wilderness. Unbeknownst to the rest of the circus, Luanne has tagged along to repay Chad for not ratting her out, and with mutual thanks they catch a train to start a new life—but Elmore, the koala who leads the circus, finds out they have escaped.

Blacksad and Neal make a stop at Blacksad&#x27;s sister&#x27;s (Donna) church, and borrow a car from her and her enthusiastic little son (Ray). Eventually the both of them catch up with the circus. Blacksad questions Elmore about Chad, but Elmore lies and betrays Blacksad to the police. After escaping, Blacksad follows and eavesdrops on Elmore as he tries to kill Chad by throwing him off the moving train, however Elmore misses and plummets to his death. Blacksad sees Chad and Luanne embrace, and realizes what has happened.

At a Greyhound Bus depot in Chicago, Blacksad and Neal arrange for Luanne to stay with Blacksad&#x27;s sister for a while. Neal promises to represent Chad and get him off with less than a year for the manslaughter of Abe, and help him publish his manuscript—the fabulous payout from Chad&#x27;s manuscript will make both of them rich. However, out of guilt, Chad has thrown the manuscript away, comparing it to toilet paper. Neal is outraged, and their loud arguing attracts a crowd. Chad tries to stop Neal from walking away, but in grabbing his coat, accidentally imbalances Neal into the road and he is violently hit by one of the buses. Blacksad runs to the ensuing commotion and sees Chad, distraught, holding the bleeding and broken body of Neal in his arms. While the crowd murmurs that Chad pushed him, Neal&#x27;s last words mention how he fell in love with Blacksad&#x27;s sister from the moment he saw her. Blacksad and Chad flee. He finds Luanne as she is about to leave and insists Chad go with her, and lie low for a while, while he deals with the police. Blacksad approaches, and is about to be handcuffed... when Chad stops them, and confesses everything, hoping to atone for what he has done.

Blacksad returns to New York, eager to get back to work, and water his plants. Meanwhile, in a bathroom stall back in the Chicago Greyhound Bus depot, a well-to-do man finds an abandoned manuscript in the bathroom, and is engrossed in reading it.

The American version features an introduction by Neal Adams, who co-translated the book into English.

It was released on 5 November 2019, on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, with a Switch release scheduled for 10 December 2019. The idea of adapting &quot;Blacksad&quot; into a game was proposed by Microïds to Pendulo, as the publisher is owned by the same media conglomerate as &quot;Blacksad&quot; publisher Dargaud.

The game was announced in July 2017, and its first teaser trailer was revealed in August 2018. By February 2019, the game had been in production for roughly two years. It was released on 14 November 2019, and a Nintendo Switch port of the game was released on 10 December 2019, to mixed critical reviews, many reviewers praised its atmosphere as being faithful to the comics, but criticized the game&#x27;s many bugs, crashes, and long loading times.
