<text>The Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked (LVT) (AMTRAC) is an amphibious warfare vehicle and amphibious landing craft, introduced by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. (The USN and USMC use &quot;L&quot; to designate Amphibious vessels, also called &quot;L class&quot;.) The United States Army, Canadian Army and British Army used several LVT models during World War II, and referred to those vehicles as &quot;Landing Vehicle, Tracked.&quot;

Originally intended solely as cargo carriers for ship to shore operations, they evolved into assault troop and fire support vehicles. The types were known as amphtrack, &quot;amtrak&quot;, &quot;amtrac&quot;, etc. (portmanteaus of &quot;amphibious tractor&quot;), and &quot;alligator&quot; or &quot;gator&quot;.

== Development ==
===The Alligator===
The LVT had its origins in a civilian rescue vehicle called the &quot;Alligator&quot;. Developed by Donald Roebling in 1935, the Alligator was intended to operate in swampy areas, inaccessible to both traditional cars and boats. Two years later, Roebling built a redesigned vehicle with improved water speed. The United States Marine Corps, which had been developing amphibious warfare doctrine based on the ideas of Lieutenant colonel Earl Hancock Ellis and others, became interested in the machine after learning about it through an article in &quot;Life&quot; magazine and convinced Roebling to design a more seaworthy model for military use.

Both the US Navy and Roebling resisted the idea of a military design; the US Navy because it felt conventional landing craft could do the job, and Roebling because he wished his invention to be used only for peaceful purposes. Roebling was persuaded after war broke out in Europe, and completed a militarized prototype by May 1940. The Bureau of Ships requested a second prototype with a more powerful engine, and the USMC tested the design in November 1940. Impressed by the second prototype, the Bureau of Ships placed a contract for production of 100 units of a model using all-steel construction, for a more rugged and easily produced design, and the first LVT-1 was delivered in July 1941. Another 200 units were ordered even before the first production units were delivered. After more improvements to meet requirements of the Navy, made difficult by Roebling&#x27;s lack of blueprints for the initial designs, the vehicle was adopted as &quot;Landing Vehicle Tracked&quot; or LVT.

===The LVT-1 design===
The contract to build the first 200 LVTs was awarded to the Food Machinery Corporation (FMC), a manufacturer of insecticide spray pumps and other farm equipment, which built some parts for the Alligators. The initial 200 LVTs were built at FMC&#x27;s factory in Dunedin, Florida, where most of the improvement work had been done as well. The first production LVT rolled out of the plant in July, 1941. Later, wartime LVT production was expanded by FMC and the Navy to four factories, including the initial facility in Dunedin; the new facilities were located in Lakeland, Florida, Riverside, California, and San Jose, California.

The LVT-1 could carry 18 fully equipped men or of cargo. Originally intended to carry replenishment from ships to shore, they lacked armor protection and their tracks and suspension were unreliable when used on hard terrain. However, the Marines soon recognized the potential of the LVT as an assault vehicle. A battalion of LVTs was ready for 1st Marine Division by 16 February 1942. The LVTs saw their first operational use in Guadalcanal, where they were used exclusively for landing supplies. About 128 LVTs were available for the landings.

===LVT-2 Buffalo and other developments===
As early as January 1940, Roebling had prepared preliminary sketches of an LVT with a gun turret to provide fire support to the landing waves. The concept languished until June 1941, when USMC recommended development of an LVT armed with a 37mm gun and three machine guns and armored against 0.50 (12.7mm) machine gun fire. Development was slow and ultimately involved a complete redesign of the LVT, the LVT-2 Buffalo. Armored versions were introduced as well as fire support versions, dubbed &quot;Amtanks&quot;, which were fitted with turrets from Stuart series light tanks (LVT(A)-1) and howitzer motor carriage M8s (LVT(A)-4).

Among other upgrades were a new powerpack (engine and cooling accessories), also borrowed from the Stuarts, and a rubber &quot;torsilastic&quot; suspension which improved performance on land. After Borg-Warner evaluated the LVT-1, Borg-Warner and FMC began work on new designs. FMC was assisted by faculty from Caltech and the University of California and developed the designs that became the LVT-2 and the LVT(A)-1. Interest in the LVT was enough that the Secretary of the Navy formed the Continued Board for the Development of the Landing Vehicle Tracked on 30 October 1943.

Production continued throughout the war, resulting in 18,616 LVTs delivered. 23 US Army and 11 USMC battalions were equipped by 1945 with LVTs. British and Australian armies also used LVTs in combat during World War II.

In the late 1940s, a series of prototypes were built and tested, but none reached production stage due to lack of funding. Realizing that acquisition of new vehicles was unlikely, the Marines modernized some of the LVT-3s and LVT(A)-5s under projects SCB-60B and SCB-60A respectively, and kept them in service until the late 1950s.

==Combat history==

===WWII Pacific Theatre===
====Guadalcanal====
USMC LVT-1s were mainly used for logistical support at Guadalcanal. LVT-1 proved in this campaign its tactical capabilities, versatility and potential for amphibious operations.

As LVT-1s were unarmed, the Marines decided to arm them using any available machine gun. Each one was armed with three .30-caliber machine guns (sometimes water-cooled models) and a .50-caliber machine gun. Organization of LVTs of the Amphibian Tractor Battalions for the assault:
* Company &quot;A&quot; of 1st Battalion with thirty LVT-1 was assigned to the 5th Marines which was to land on Guadalcanal.
* A platoon of LVT-1s assigned to 2nd Marine Battalion went ashore on Tulagi.
* Company &quot;B&quot; was assigned to the 1st Marine Regiment.
* The remainder of the 1st Battalion remained with the 1st Division&#x27;s support group.
* Company &quot;A&quot; of the 2nd Battalion was assigned to 2nd Marine Regiment, the landing force reserve.

====Tarawa====
In the amphibious assault on Tarawa in late 1943, the LVTs were first used for amphibious assault in order to negotiate the barrier reef, where several Higgins Boats had run aground and became stuck, and arrive to the most heavily defended beaches the Americans ever met in the Pacific. This was also the first use of the LVT-2 Water Buffalo in combat. 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion LVTs took part in the first, second, and third waves of landings and carried the continuous supply of ammunition, reinforcements, and ferrying back of the wounded. Of 125 vehicles used (50 new LVT-2s and 75 LVT-1s), only 35 remained operational by the end of the first day, continuing to ferry men and supplies across the coral reef and through the shallows to the beach.

The 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion had only about 79 LVT-1s and 50 LVT-2s (directly shipped from San Diego) available for the assault. Most of the troops had to disembark from LCVP &quot;Higgins boats&quot; and wade across the reef in chest-deep or higher water while under heavy enemy fire. American casualties were very heavy and many who made it to the beach alive had lost their rifles and other essential gear.

====Design Developments in the Pacific====
After Tarawa, many changes were made. The USMC recommended that a battalion of armored LVTs, two companies of DUKWs and two battalions of cargo LVTs be assigned to each division in future amphibious operations. The number of LVTs by battalion was increased to 300; before Tarawa it was 100. Due to mechanical reliability problems after every landing, the Marines replaced all LVTs used in operations.

As a result of Tarawa experience, standardized armor kits were provided for the LVTs to be used in contested landings. Other improvements were made in the damage repair area, machine gun shields, and in the LVT design to increase crew and LVT survivability.

The gun-armed &quot;amtank&quot; LVT(A)-1 and LVT(A)-4 were developed to provide fire support. Armed with a 75mm howitzer, the latter was introduced in 1944 just before the Marianas campaign and was especially effective in this role as it was capable of destroying Japanese fortifications as it came ashore. Its howitzer complemented the 75mm gun of the M4 Sherman tanks used by the Marines. However, the LVT(A)-4 had an open-topped turret which left the crew vulnerable to artillery and infantry attack, especially to the latter, as it lacked any sort of machine gun armament. The lack of machine gun armament was eventually rectified, though the open-topped turret remained in order to save weight. Although usually used in a direct role during landings only (once inland the &quot;amtanks&quot; were assigned to artillery formations to augment their firepower), in the Marianas campaign &quot;amtanks&quot; were employed inland, much like regular tanks.

==== Bougainville, Marshall Islands and Saipan ====
In November 1943, US Marines landed on the island of Bougainville. 29 LVTs were landed on the first day, with a total of 124 LVTs operating with the Marines during the landing.

In the campaign for the Marshall Islands, the full range of the LVT models became available, including armed Amtrac LVTs based on the proven LVT-2 with a tank gun turret. This provided close-in firepower as the cargo LVTs neared the beach. The combination of armoured cargo LVT-2 and the armed LVT(A)-1 together helped to capture the Marshalls far ahead of schedule.

Saipan saw the massive use of the LVTs by the USMC with six battalions of cargo LVT, including the new ramped LVT-4, and two battalions of armored Amtracs, employing the new LVT(A)-4 with a 75 mm howitzer.

====Tinian and Peleliu====

At Tinian a field variant of the LVT-2 was created by the Seabees of the 3rd Battalion 18th Marines and 3rd Battalion 20th Marines. V Amphibious Corps chose beaches abutted by coral embankments up to 15 feet. The Japanese thought the embankments made the beaches unsuitable for a landing. The CB engineers constructed detachable ramps mounted on LVTs to make such an assault possible. Salvaging iron beams from the damaged sugar factory on Saipan they fabricated 10 assault vehicles. Their commander, General Harry Schmidt, was skeptical and ordered a vehicle go up and down a ramp 100 times before approving their use in combat. The Tinian assault was a success. The defenders were quickly overwhelmed compromising the remainder of the defenses. The Seabees named their LVTs &quot;doodlebugs&quot;.

From the Peleliu campaign on, a number of LVTs were fitted with a flamethrower for use against fortifications. The LVT was usually flanked by a pair of gun tanks for protection. A number of LVTs were converted to armored ambulances carrying a doctor and three corpsmen. LVTs were also employed as guide boats for tanks unloading onto submerged reefs.

====Philippines====
The largest use of LVTs was in the Leyte landing in October 1944, with nine US Army amtrac and two amtank battalions deployed by US Army Sixth Army. These US Army LVTs were later used in other Philippine islands landings. 54 LVT(4) tracked amphibious assault vehicles of the 672nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion as part of the raiding force on 23 February 1945 forged across Laguna de Bay and crashed the gates during the liberation of Los Baños Internment Camp. They ferried the weakened liberated civilians back behind the lines during the contested withdrawal.

The US Army 826th Amphibious Tractor Battalion provided Company A to land 43rd Infantry Division troops in first wave of this first American return to the Philippine Islands. Following the landing Company A &quot;amphibs&quot; were utilized to transport dead and wounded, carry supplies inland and provide support throughout the invasion and subsequent taking of Leyte. Company A vehicles brought troops for the second major landing on Leyte at Ormoc. The Battalion provided vehicles for the landing at Luzon as well and during the conquest of Luzon personnel were heavily involved in clean-up operations of Japanese troops left behind the advance.

====Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign====
The LVT-4 played a crucial role both as the assault vehicle to carry troops and as the chief logistical vehicle in the first days of Battle of Iwo Jima. Ashore, the LVTs were used to rescue wheeled vehicles that could not navigate Iwo Jima&#x27;s soft volcanic ash and steep terraces. In addition, American troops used the LVTs to transport casualties from the front lines to evacuation sites on the beaches. The 75 mm howitzer on the LVT-4 provided important fire support as the Marines slowly advanced across the island.

Okinawa was the largest landing in the Central Pacific drive. The new LVT-3, which featured a redesign of the arrangement of the powertrain, was used successfully through the long Battle of Okinawa. Over 1,000 LVTs took part in the campaign.

===Europe===
In Europe, LVTs were mainly used for landings and river crossing operations as well as assaults in swampy zones. By the end of 1943, 200 LVT-1s had been delivered to the British Army for training in preparation for future operations in Europe. The U.S., British, and Canadian armies used the Buffalo in the 1944 Battle of the Scheldt in the Low Countries, during Operation Plunder crossing of the Rhine in March 1945, along the Po River in Italy, across the river Elbe, and in a number of other river crossing operations.

LVTs were used in the Normandy landings, but their use by the United States was limited as the US Army doctrine in Europe viewed the Sherman DD as the answer to assault on heavily defended beaches. LVT-2s were used to help unload supplies after the landings on Utah Beach from the cargo ships off the coast to the beach and through the nearby swamps.

For the Rhine crossing, the British 21st Army Group had some 600 Buffalos available, most of them used to transport the assault infantry. As mud was expected to hamper the Sherman DD tanks, some LVTs were armed with a 20 mm cannon and two machine guns to give fire support until bridges could be constructed across the river. The &quot;Specials&quot; were under the 79th Armoured Division (which operated and coordinated the use of all specialist assault vehicles), that also provided Buffalos fitted with &quot;Bobbin&quot; carpets to create temporary roadways over the mud.

The US Army used LVT-2s and LVT-4s in Europe in small numbers in 1944–45 for river crossing operations. LVT-2s and LVT-4s were used by US troops on the Roer River crossing in 1945. US Army LVT-4&#x27;s were also used by 752nd Tank Battalion to ferry 88th Infantry Division troops across the Po River in Italy in April 1945.

Five LVT-4s were supplied through Lend-Lease to the Soviet Red Army, which used them when assaulting the well-defended west banks of the Oder and Danube rivers.

===North Africa===
The first operational use of the LVT in North Africa was in November 1942. A small number of LVT-1s were used during the landings on the coast of North Africa during Operation Torch. Four LVT-1s and two bulldozers were assigned to each shore party engineer company. Their tasks were towing vehicles and boat salvage operations. LVT-1s proved useful in getting stranded landing craft afloat, but they also experienced many mechanical failures.

===South East Asia===
Some of the reconnaissance units of the British Fourteenth Army in Burma operated LVT-1s. Although originally planned to fight against the Japanese on the Burmese coast at the end of 1943, this part of the operations plan was cancelled and no LVT-1s were used in combat. In 1945, the Royal Marines Amphibious support unit was created. Its LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s supported Royal Marines landings in Burma and Malaya.

===Post-World War II===

Some LVT-3s, LVT-3Cs, and modified LVT(A)-5s saw action in the Korean War. The French Army used the U.S.-supplied LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s in the Indochina War and in the Suez Crisis. During the Korean War, LVT(3)Cs and LVT(A)s were used for the landing in Incheon and subsequent Han River crossing to re-take Seoul. It was also used in the evacuation of Hungnam Harbour when Chinese forces attacked. The LVT(3)C was used by USMC in Korea as both an amphibious vehicle, and in the role of an armored personnel carrier while on land. Nationalist China (ROC) forces used some US-provided LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s during China&#x27;s civil war against communist Chinese troops. Many were captured by communist Chinese forces, with at least several dozen refitted with a Soviet ZiS-2 57 mm anti-tank gun in place of the original US 75 mm howitzer-gun following their successful capture of mainland China from the Chinese Nationalists in 1949.

===French Indochina===
French armored units developed the use of amphibious tracked vehicles in Indochina: The amphibious C model of the M29 Weasel (armed either with FM1924/29, Bren or Browning M1919 machine guns and with 57mm M18A1 recoilless guns), LVT-4s (equipped with two M2 and two M1919 machine guns, and sometimes equipped with 40mm Bofors guns or 57 mm recoilless guns) and LVT(A)-4 (with 75 mm howitzer) were used to great effect by &quot;1er Régiment Etrangers de Cavalerie&quot;. In 1950, the French Army received a number of LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s from the US to supplement M29Cs. In September 1951, the first French mixed unit (&quot;1er Groupement Autonome&quot;) was created, consisting of two squadrons of Weasels (33 each), three squadrons of LVT-4 (11 each) and one fire support platoon of 6 LVT(A)-4. Later a second group was created in Tonkin when more LVTs were received. Both these groups participated in Mekong and Red River delta operations and in landing operations on Vietnam shores. The also deployed a platoon of LVTs. LVTs were known as &quot;alligators&quot; in French armed forces.

=== Suez ===
During the 1956 Suez Canal crisis, 40 and 42 Commando of the Royal Marines made a landing in Port Said in LVTs, supported by a number of Centurion tanks from the Royal Tank Regiment. The French Navy assigned 13 LVT-4s to the Force H, to be used by the &quot;1ère compagnie du 1er R.E.P.&quot; and &quot;3eme Marine Commando&quot; during their assault on Port Fuad.

==Other operators==
At the end of the war, the oldest LVT versions were disposed as surplus and sold to other countries. Only LVT-3 and LVT(A)-5s remained in operational use in the US armed forces. In 1947 a dozen Buffalo LVTs were used by the British Army to fix a breach in the flood defenses at Crowland in Lincolnshire fens following the terrible winter that year. Five LVTs were swept away and lost in flood waters. On 29 April 2021 one of the missing vehicles was excavated from 30 feet below the surface after being located in an English field. (See also #Preservation.) During Operation Highjump, the United States Navy Antarctic Developments Program from 1946 to 1947, LVT-3s and LVT-4s were tested in Antarctic conditions.

== Modern descendants ==
In the 1950s, LVTs still in service were replaced by the LVTP-5 family of vehicles (which prevailed in a competition over the LVT-6, a navalized M59); the LVTP-5 in turn were followed by the LVT-7 family, eventually redesignated Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV). The AAV is manufactured by BAE Systems Land and Armaments, which is the successor company to FMC.

In 1958, the US Navy tested the largest LVT ever produced, the LVT(U)X2 &quot;Goliath&quot; produced by Pacific Car and Foundry. The Goliath was large enough to transport any load the conventional Landing Craft Utility could carry, including a 60-ton main battle tank, from a landing dock ship to shore and across beach barriers. Only one Goliath was built and it never became operational.

Currently, many of the world&#x27;s militaries employ more modern versions of the amtrack. One of the latest is the now cancelled United States Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, that was slated to begin replacing the AAV in 2015 but was cancelled in 2011 after going significantly over budget.

== Variants ==
The US Army used a different naming system from the Navy but instead of using the usual Army system of Model (M)-numbers, they referred to the LVTs by Mark number using Roman numerals rather than Arabic numerals. Hence the LVT-4 was the &quot;Mark IV&quot;. In British service LVTs were given service names and mark numbers to distinguish them.

===LVT-1===

The first military model. Traveling at a respectable laden in the water and on land, it could deliver 20 fully equipped assault troops to the beach and supply supporting fire from two .30 M1919 Browning machine guns though it was only intended for delivering supplies inland until wheeled vehicles could be brought ashore. It was powered by a Hercules WXLC six-cylinder petrol engine, mounted in a housing in the rear cargo hold. The LVT-1 was propelled on both land and water by tracks which were fitted with Roebling patented oblique shoes that gave good grip on land as well as good drive in the water. A part of the forward driver&#x27;s compartment, the bulk of the unarmoured steel hull was given over to a cargo area 21 ft 6 in by 9 ft 10 in which could be laden to . The hold was divided into several watertight compartments. 1,225 LVT-1s were built between 1941 and 1943, 485 were transferred to the US Army and 200 to the British Army. The LVT-1 had a maximum speed of on land or in water; and a range of on land or in water.

No armor or weapons were included in its design as its role was cargo transport from ship to shore. Many vehicles were refitted prior to the Tarawa landing to hold two Browning heavy machine guns forward, with the .30 guns aft. The vehicle was not armored and its thin steel hull offered virtually no protection, although prior to Tarawa some vehicles received of armor plating to the cab. Tracks performed well on sand, but not on tough surfaces. The rigid suspension threw tracks and roller bearings corroded in salt water. Proper maintenance of the new machine was often an issue, as few Marines were trained to work on it, and early models suffered frequent breakdowns. As LVT-1 vehicles experienced many breakdowns they were gradually phased out of operational use before 1945.

===LVT-2 &quot;Water Buffalo&quot;, British designation &quot;Buffalo II&quot;===

This was an improved version of LVT-1. It featured a new powertrain (to save time and to simplify production it was the same Continental radial 7-cylinder engine as that in the M3A1 Stuart light tank) in the rear of the hull with a propshaft along the centreline to the transmission at the front, and torsilastic suspension. The aluminium track grousers were bolted on, making changes much easier since they wore out quickly on land and even more so on coral. Hard terrain performance was much better compared to the LVT-1. 2,962 units were produced for the US Navy, who then proceeded to transfer 1,507 to the US Army and 100 to the British Army. With a maximum speed of on land and on water) and an operational endurance of 150 miles on land (or on water) the LVT-2 could carry a normal payload of or 24 fully equipped troops. Portable plating of &quot;10 lb&quot; rating on the sponson sides and hull rear and &#x27;20 lb&#x27; on the front and cab could be fitted.

Rails for mounting machine guns ran round the sides and rear of the cargo space and across the back of the cab.

LVT-2s participated in more campaigns than any other LVT variant, including Tarawa, Roi-Namur, Cape Gloucester, Northern Kwajalein, Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and in some parts of Europe, such as the Rhine crossing of Operation Plunder.

===LVT(A)-1===

The LVT(A) Mark 1 was the first infantry support LVT. With the first experience of Pacific amphibious operations it was clear heavier firepower than the usual .50 in guns was needed. Based on the LVT-2, &quot;A&quot; standing for &#x27;armored&#x27;, this fire support version had a hull with plate on the bow, cab and turret and of armor elsewhere. It was fitted with a turret nearly identical to that of the Light Tank M3, with a 37 mm Gun M6 in an M44 mount and coaxial 0,30-inch machine gun. Two more 0.30-inch machine guns on ring mounts on the rear deck behind the turret, 509 units were produced. It was powered by a air-cooled petrol engine. Due to the limitations imposed by the turret, it could carry only a limited payload of of but maintained the same speed of on land and in water of the Mark 2, with an operational endurance of on land or in water.

These vehicles were intended to provide fire support to the assaulting Marines in the early stages of establishing a beachhead. It was common, however, for the LVT(A)s to commence firing whilst still in the water.

At Roi-Namur, the 24th Marines had support of LVT(A)-1s, but they could not close up enough to effectively support the troops from the beaches. Other LVT(A)-1s supported the 22nd Marines landing at Engebi. By mid-1944, all LVT(A)-1s had been replaced by much more capable 75mm gun armed LVT(A)-4s. This switch was primarily due to the LVT(A)-1 M6 gun lacking adequate bunker busting capabilities. The inability to neutralize bunkers on or near the beachheads was an inherent risk for Marines storming out of their landing craft.

===LVT(A)-2 &quot;Water Buffalo&quot;===
This was an armored version of the LVT-2, following the US Army&#x27;s request for an armored variant of the LVT-2. Service in the South Pacific soon indicated more protection was needed. This version had the driver&#x27;s cab protected by of armor plate, and the rest of the hull with armor plate. By 1944, shields were added to protect the front gunners. Surprisingly the additional of armor, added to the weight of the unarmored LVT-2, had no impact on performance and only caused the craft to draw an additional of water when afloat. The LVT(A)-2 had a capacity of 18 troops. 450 units produced.

===LVT-4 &quot;Water Buffalo&quot;, British designation &quot;Buffalo IV&quot;===
FMC modified an LVT-2 in August 1943 by moving the engine forward and adding a large ramp door in the rear, allowing troops to exit from the rear of the vehicle. Capacity went from 16 troops in the LVT-2 to 30, making earlier LVTs largely obsolete. This innovation also greatly facilitated the loading and unloading of cargo. Some vehicles received armor kits. It was by far the most numerous version of the LVT, with 8,348 units delivered; the US Army received 6,083, and the British Army 500. Many of the British LVT-4 were armed with a 20 mm Polsten cannon and two .30 in (7.62 mm) Browning machine guns. Removable 20 lb and 10 lb armor kits could be fitted.

Since no major changes were made to the engine and transmission of the LVT-2, the LVT-4 was completed much quicker than the LVT-3, with the first machines going into action at Saipan in June 1944.

===&quot;Sea Serpent&quot;===
The Sea Serpent was designed by the 79th Armoured Division for use by the British in the Far East. Its armament was two &quot;Wasp&quot; flamethrowers and a machine gun. These would have been used by the &quot;flame battery&quot; of the 34th Amphibian Support Regiment, Royal Marines in any assault on the Japanese mainland but the war ended before they were used.

===LVT(A)-3===
Developed as a version of the LVT-4 with armor built in but never approved for production.

===LVT-3 &quot;Bushmaster&quot;===

Developed by the Borg Warner Corporation as their Model B in April 1943. To allow for rear loading, the engines were moved to the sponsons and a ramp installed in the rear, and the cargo area was slightly wider to provide room for a Jeep to be carried in the cargo hold. Some received armor kits. First used in combat in Okinawa in April 1945. The twin Cadillac V-8 petrol engines were connected by driveshafts to the transmission (the same as the M5 light tank) in the front of the hull. It could carry a payload of or 30 fully armed soldiers. 2,962 units produced, with many remaining in US service until 1955 when they were finally superseded by the LVTP-5. It performed with efficiency and greater reliability, as more maintenance time was generally available than during World War II. The LVT(3)C remained standard with the Marine Corps until the introduction of the first major post—war design, the LVT(P)5, in 1953. Overall weight of the craft was , and its maximum speed was on land or on water, with an operational range of on land or on water.

===LVT(A)-4===
The 37 mm gun of the LVT(A)-1 was inadequate for fire support version so the turret of the 75 mm howitzer motor carriage M8armed with a 75 mm howitzerwas used to produce the LVT(A)-4. In some cases, the 75 mm was replaced with the Canadian Ronson flamethrower. A single .50 cal machine gun was installed on the ring mount above the turret rear. In late production vehicles, the heavy machine gun was replaced with two .30 caliber M1919A4 machine guns on pintle mounts on the sides of the turret, and one more in the bow. 1,890 units produced, with 1,307 were transferred to the US Army and 50 to the British Army. The hull was armoured as the Mark 1 but the open-topped M8 turret was up to 1-inch thick.

The Chinese PLA captured several from Nationalist forces during the Civil War and placed them in service, eventually modifying some by replacing the 75 mm howitzer with the 37 mm M6 tank gun and others with the ZiS-2 57 mm anti-tank gun, complete with shield, the conversion also necessitating the removal of the original mantlet.

===LVT(A)-5===

Introduced in 1945, the LVT(A)-5 was a LVT(A)-4 with a powered turret and a gyrostabilizer for the howitzer. Some were upgraded in the late 1940s by modifying the armor configuration. 269 units produced.

===LVT-3C===
Modified LVT-3. An armored roof was fitted and the bow was extended to improve buoyancy. Armament included a .30 inch machine gun in a turret and another in a ball mount in the bow. 1,200 LVT-3s were converted.

===Amphibian, tracked, 4-ton General Service (&quot;Neptune&quot;)===
A British vehicle based on the LVT-4, known as the &quot;Neptune&quot;, was built by Nuffield. Only a handful of the 2,000 ordered were completed. The &quot;Sealion&quot; was a recovery version, and the &quot;Turtle&quot; a workshop version.

==Preservation==

===Philippines===
Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked (LVT) is Preserved at the Philippine Military AcademyFort Del Pilar, Baguio City Philippines .

===United Kingdom===
In 1947, a Buffalo LVT being used in flood defense work in Crowland, Lincolnshire, UK, was swept away and buried. In 2021, it was excavated and retrieved, and volunteers are planning to preserve and restore it to running order.

<text>The plate lunch () is a quintessentially Hawaiian meal, roughly analogous to the Southern U.S. meat-and-three or Japanese bento box. The combination of Polynesian, North American and East Asian cuisine arose naturally in Hawaii, and has spread beyond it.

Standard plate lunches consist of one or two scoops of white rice, macaroni salad (in an American style), and an entrée (usually in a Japanese style such as chicken katsu or teriyaki). A plate lunch with more than one entrée is often called a &quot;mixed plate&quot;.

== Origins ==

Although the exact origin of the Hawaiian plate lunch is disputed, according to Professor Jon Okamura of the University of Hawaiʻi, the plate lunch likely grew out of the Japanese bento, because &quot;bentos were take away kinds of eating and certainly the plate lunch continues that tradition&quot;. Its appearance in Hawaii in recognizable form goes back to the 1880s when plantation workers were in high demand by the fruit and sugar companies on the islands. Laborers were brought to Hawaii from around the world, including from China, Japan, Portugal, and the Philippines. Kaui Philpotts, former food editor of the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;, notes that the laborers &quot;didn&#x27;t eat sandwiches or things like that; it was leftover rice and a lot of things like canned meat or teriyaki or cold meat or maybe scrambled eggs or pickles, and almost no salad or vegetable.&quot; Later on, macaroni salad was added to the plates, as it seemed to bridge national tastes and also mixed well with gravy-covered slabs of meat. Some locations also include the traditional Korean side dish &quot;kimchi&quot;.

As the days of the plantations came to an end, plate lunches began to be served on-site by lunch wagons to construction workers and day laborers. Later, local hole-in-the-wall restaurants and other stand-alone plate lunch restaurants began popping up, then plate lunch franchises. Eventually, these made their way to the U.S. mainland such as the former L&amp;L Drive-Inn chain in California in 1999. L&amp;L founder Eddie Flores rebranded it &quot;L&amp;L Hawaiian Barbecue&quot;, explaining that &quot;When we went to the mainland, the name &#x27;Hawaiian&#x27; is a draw, because everyone just fantasized, everyone wants to come to Hawaii.&quot;

== Popular entrées ==
Popular plate lunch entrées reflect Polynesian, North American and East Asian influence. 

Japanese entrées include chicken &quot;katsu&quot; (fried boneless chicken breaded with panko) and beef &quot;teriyaki&quot;. 

Korean entrées include &quot;kalbi&quot; and &quot;meat jun&quot;. 

Other Asian ethnic contributions include Chinese-influenced &quot;char siu pork&quot;, the Okinawan shoyu pork (Okinawan: &quot;rafute&quot;), and Filipino &quot;chicken adobo&quot; and &quot;longanisa&quot; (a traditional Spanish sausage). Western European dishes include &quot;linguiça&quot;, a traditional Portuguese sausage.

Entrées of Hawaiian origin include &quot;kālua puaʻa&quot; (roast pork) and &quot;laulau&quot; (pork or other meat or fish wrapped in a taro leaf). Some Hawaiian side dishes are lomi-lomi salmon (salmon salad) and &quot;haupia&quot; (a coconut dessert).

The traditional mayonnaise-based macaroni salad is an American contribution. Another notably American element is the hamburger steak, a ground beef patty smothered with brown gravy served atop rice; adding a sunny-side-up egg makes it a loco moco. 

Other common side dishes with plate lunches include fried noodles, often &quot;chow mein&quot;, &quot;chow fun&quot; or &quot;saimin&quot;, the Hawaiian &quot;taegu&quot;, a dish made of shredded codfish, and Korean &quot;kongnamul muchim&quot;, a dish made of seasoned soybean sprouts.

<text>Auroville (; City of Dawn French: Cité de l&#x27;aube) is an experimental township in Viluppuram district, mostly in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, with some parts in the Union Territory of Puducherry in India. It was founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa (known as &quot;the Mother&quot;) and designed by architect Roger Anger.

==Etymology==
Auroville has its origins in the French language, &quot;Aurore&quot; meaning dawn and &quot;Ville&quot; meaning village/city. Additionally, it is named after Sri Aurobindo (1872–1950).

==History==

At its Annual Conference in 1964 and with Mirra Alfassa as its Executive President, the Sri Aurobindo Society in Pondicherry passed a resolution for the establishment of a city dedicated to the vision of Sri Aurobindo. Alfassa was the spiritual collaborator of Sri Aurobindo, who believed that &quot;man is a transitional being.&quot; Alfassa expected that this experimental &quot;universal township&quot; would contribute significantly to the &quot;progress of humanity towards its splendid future by bringing together people of goodwill and aspiration for a better world&quot;. Alfassa also believed that such a universal township would contribute decisively to the Indian Renaissance.

Alfassa&#x27;s first public message in 1965 stated:

===Site===
A site, approximately 20 square kilometres of desertified plateau, some 10 km north of Pondicherry and 5 km from the coast, was chosen for the city.

===Inauguration===
The inauguration ceremony attended by delegates of 124 nations was held on Wednesday 28 February 1968. Handwritten in French by Mirra Alfassa (the Mother), its four-point charter set forth her vision of integral living:

# Auroville belongs to nobody in particular. Auroville belongs to humanity as a whole. But to live in Auroville, one must be the willing servitor of the Divine Consciousness.
# Auroville will be the place of an unending education, of constant progress, and a youth that never ages.
# Auroville wants to be the bridge between the past and the future. Taking advantage of all discoveries from without and from within, Auroville will boldly spring toward future realizations.
# Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living embodiment of an actual human unity.

==The Matrimandir==

In the middle of the town is the Matrimandir, which was conceived by Alfassa as &quot;a symbol of the Divine&#x27;s answer to man&#x27;s aspiration for perfection&quot;. Silence is maintained inside the Matrimandir to ensure the tranquility of the space, and the entire area surrounding the Matrimandir is called the Peace area. Inside the Matrimandir, a spiraling ramp leads upwards to an air-conditioned chamber of polished white marble referred to as &quot;a place to find one&#x27;s consciousness&quot;.

Matrimandir is equipped with a solar power plant and is surrounded by manicured gardens. When there is no sunlight, the sunray on the globe is replaced by a beam from a solar-powered light.

Radiating from this center are four &quot;zones&quot; of the City Area: the &quot;Residential Zone&quot;, &quot;Industrial Zone&quot;, &quot;Cultural (&amp; Educational) Zone&quot; and &quot;International Zone&quot;. Around the city or the urban area, lies a Green Belt which is an environmental research and resource area and includes farms and forestries, a botanical garden, seed bank, medicinal and herbal plants, water catchment bunds, and some communities.

==Legal status and government==
Prior to 1980, the Sri Aurobindo Society legally owned all of the city&#x27;s assets. In 1980, the Government of India passed the Auroville Emergency Provision Act 1980, under which it took over the city&#x27;s management. The change was initiated when, after Mirra Alfassa&#x27;s death in 1973, serious fissures in the day-to-day management developed between the Society and the city&#x27;s residents. The residents appealed to Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India for an intervention. The Society challenged the Government&#x27;s action in the Supreme Court of India. The final verdict upheld the constitutional validity of the government&#x27;s action and intervention.

In 1988, after the verdict, a need was felt to make a lasting arrangement for the long term management of Auroville. The city&#x27;s representatives along with Sh. Kireet Joshi, then Educational Advisor to the Union government, met for consultations with the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi. Later that year, the Auroville Foundation Act 1988, was passed by the Indian Parliament. The Act stipulated the vesting of all movable and immovable assets of the city in a foundation, known as Auroville Foundation and the creation of a three-tier governing system: the Governing Board; the Residents&#x27; Assembly and the Auroville International Advisory Council. The Governing Board selected by the Government of India consists of seven prominent Indians in the fields of education, culture, environment and social service in the areas of Auroville&#x27;s ideals. The International Advisory Council comprises five members also selected by the Government, chosen from people who have rendered valuable service to humanity in the areas of Auroville&#x27;s ideals. The Resident&#x27;s Assembly consists of all official residents of the city. All three governing bodies are meant to work in harmony and collaborate to accomplish the ideals of Auroville as mentioned in the charter, as per processes defined in the Auroville Foundation Act

The Auroville Foundation is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The HRD ministry appoints the seven members of the Governing Board and the five members of the International Advisory Council. There is also a Secretary to the Foundation, appointed by the Government of India, who resides and has an office with supporting staff in Auroville. The Foundation currently owns about half of the total land required for the township. The remaining lands are being purchased whenever funds are available.

===Chairman throughout the years ===
* Karan Singh – former Union Minister, 1991
* M. S. Swaminathan – agricultural scientist
* Kireet Joshi – former Special Educational Advisor to the Government of India
* R. N. Ravi - Governor of Tamil Nadu

==Society and population==

In the initial 20 years, about 400 individuals from 20 countries resided in the township. In the next 20 years, this number rose to 2,000 individuals from 40 countries. , it has 2,814 residents (2,127 adults and 687 children) from 54 countries with around 50% from India, and almost 20% from both France and Germany. The community had many residential housing clusters with Tamil, English, French and Sanskrit names like &quot;Aspiration&quot;, &quot;Arati&quot;, &quot;La Ferme&quot;, &quot;Auromodel&quot; and &quot;Isaiambalam&quot;.

===Demographics===
The population break-down:
===Surrounding villages===
Auroville works closely together with the surrounding villages, where mainly Tamil people reside, via the Auroville Village Action Trust under which many different projects including the villages fall. The biggest one under the trust is the Auroville Village Action Group (AVAG), which has programs for women&#x27;s empowerment, education, and financial support, and also sells its own products in the name of AVAL, Surya and Kudumbam as social enterprise work. Other activities falling under the trust are the Life Education Centre, Auroville Industrial School, Mohanam cultural centre, Auroville Health Services, Deepam school for handicapped children, Thamarai community centre, Martuvam Healing forest, and the Reach for the Stars! program enabling higher education for village youth. Concerns exist because of violence allegedly caused by criminal elements entering from the surrounding villages.

==Economy==
Instead of paper and coin currency, residents are given account numbers to connect to their central account. Visitors are requested to get a temporary account and an Aurocard, a special debit card for its citizens. 

Residents of Auroville are expected to make a monthly contribution to the community. They are asked to help the community whenever possible by work, money, or kind. The &quot;guest contribution&quot;, or a daily fee paid by the guests of Auroville, constitutes a part of Auroville&#x27;s budget. There is a system of &quot;maintenance&quot;, whereby those Aurovilians in need can receive from the community monthly maintenance which covers simple basic needs of life. Auroville&#x27;s economy and its overall life are of an evolving nature and there are ongoing experiments to reach closer to the vision.

The Government of India only finances a small amount of Auroville&#x27;s budget, which is mainly formed by contributions from Auroville&#x27;s commercial units which contribute 33% of their profits to Auroville&#x27;s Central Fund and by donations, largely foreign, from Auroville&#x27;s multiple international bases set up all over the world. There are guest houses, building construction units, information technology, small and medium scale businesses, producing and re-selling items such as handmade paper for stationery items, organic food, as well as producing its well-known incense sticks, which can be bought in Auroville&#x27;s own shop in Puducherry. They are also sold online in India and abroad. Each of these units contributes a considerable part of their profits to the township. Over 5,000 people, mostly from the nearby localities, are employed in various sections and units of Auroville.

Other activities include afforestation, organic agriculture, basic educational research, health care, village development, appropriate technology, town planning, water table management, cultural activities, and community services.

==Location==

Auroville is composed of a cluster of properties some north of Pondicherry. It can be easily reached via the East Coast Road (ECR) which connects Chennai and Pondicherry. The visitor center and Matrimandir can be reached by traveling westwards from the signposted turnoff at the ECR Bommayapalayam. Turning east leads directly to Auroville&#x27;s private beach called Repos, several hundred meters away.

==Climate==
It is included in the sub-humid tropics (wet-and-dry tropical climate) situated on a plateau region with its maximum elevation of above sea level located in the Matrimandir area. The annual rainfall average is mainly from the SW monsoon (June to Sept.) and NE monsoon (Nov to Dec) with a dry period of approx 6 months. The average maximum temperature is , average minimum .

==Communications and media==
The Auroville website provides open as well as restricted forums for various projects, interests, organizations, and outreach which make up the life of the community. The opinions expressed in these publications are not necessarily those of the community at large. The Auroville radio website provides recordings and daily news covering local events. Auroville also has an internal MediaInterface, formerly OutreachMedia, team to regulate visits of journalists and film/video makers, which has served the community for many decades. Their aim is to ensure that all journalists and filmmakers get official, up-to-date information and representative footage from reliable sources.

==BBC child abuse investigation==
In May 2008, the BBC produced a 10-minute &quot;Newsnight&quot; film about Auroville, which was aired on BBC Two. A short version was aired on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;From Our Own Correspondent&quot;. It also appeared on BBC Online. The reports contrasted the idealism of its founders with allegations by some people that the community tolerates pedophiles, especially in a school that Auroville has established for local village children. 

Auroville filed an official complaint to the BBC that the report was biased, untrue and contravened BBC editorial ethical guidelines. After investigations, Ofcom did not uphold the complaint.

== Controversial development plans ==
On 4 December 2021, local police, joined by a group of outsiders, began demolishing the Auroville Youth Centre – uprooting the surrounding trees with the help of earthmovers. Despite the protests by the residents, on 5 December more than 900 trees were bulldozed across 67 acres in Auroville. An internal petition signed by more than 500 Auroville residents requested postponement of the development work on the Crown Road ‘Right of Way’, until the Auroville community could arrive at a collective agreement on a practical way forward. An application filed by some residents of Auroville against the ongoing illegal clearing of forests by the Auroville Foundation led the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) of India to order an interim stay on felling of trees on 17 December 2021. This ban against tree felling inside Auroville was extended by the NGT until the next court hearing on 3 January. The verdict was announced on 28 April 2022, which directed the Auroville Foundation Office to prepare a proper township plan and apply for Environmental Clearance (EC) under Item 8 (b) of the EIA Notification, 2006. Till then they were directed not to proceed with further construction in the project area with the exception of ets the completion of the crown road given a Joint Committee comprising officials in forest, wildlife, and state departments inspect the area in question and the Auroville Foundation Office undertake the crown road work in the remaining stretches where there are no trees.

==50th anniversary==
By occasion of the 50th anniversary of Auroville on 28 February 2018 the Indian President Ram Nath Kovind sent a message to the community in which he called Sri Aurobindo &quot;one of modern India&#x27;s greatest sages&quot;. He also wrote that Auroville &quot;represents humanity&#x27;s aspiration for peace and goodwill&quot; and that it is &quot;a unique symbol of human unity&quot;.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and Auroville on 25 February 2018. After a meditation in the Matrimandir and participation in some functions he gave a speech in the Sri Aurobindo Auditorium. He referred to the Auroville Charter and the basic principles of life in the community. Then he said, &quot;Indian society is fundamentally diverse. It has fostered dialogue and a philosophic tradition. Auroville showcases this ancient Indian tradition to the world by bringing together global diversity.&quot; At the end of his speech, he expressed his wish that Auroville may continue developing and supporting new and creative ideas for India and the whole world.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="1129764" wikidata="Q5566323" url="?curid=1129764" title="Gladstone Dock">
<text>Gladstone Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Bootle. The dock is connected to Seaforth Dock to the north and what remains of Hornby Dock to the south. Part of Liverpool Freeport, Gladstone Dock is operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company.

==History==
The dock is named after Robert Gladstone, a merchant from Liverpool and second cousin of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. Designed in the first decade of the twentieth century, construction was eventually completed in 1927 and consisted of of quays and extensive warehouse space.

The graving dock was completed in 1913, before the rest of the dock became operational. At long and wide it was designed to take the largest trans-Atlantic steamers. The graving dock has since been converted into a wet dock (Gladstone Number Three Branch Dock).

Gladstone Dock lock entrance is one of the two remaining operational river entrances in the northern dock system. Measuring long, wide and deep; was wider, longer and deeper than the Panama Canal locks at the time of opening. The Panama Canal and Gladstone locks could accommodate a maximum size of container ship of 4,500-5,000 twenty-foot-equivalent units (TEUs). The lock provided maritime access to the container terminal of the adjacent Royal Seaforth Dock, which opened in 1972.

However in 2016 the Panama Canal locks will were enlarged to a size larger than the Gladstone locks: long, wide and deep, accommodating vessels with capacities of up to 14,000 TEUs, depending on the vessel design. Rather than enlarge the Gladstone locks to match the size of the Panama locks, the Port of Liverpool built an in-river berth, in the tidal river, serving a new container terminal called Liverpool2. Container ships unable to enter the Gladstone lock will need to use the adjacent in-river berthing at Liverpool2. Liverpool2 solved the problem of the disruption of enlarging the Gladstone locks, and also giving container handling expansion.

Simultaneously the NY-NJ port in the USA deepened its access channel and raised the Bayonne Bridge to accommodate the large vessels transiting the Panama Canal. The expansions at Liverpool and New York means larger ships can operate between the two ports.

At the outbreak of the First World War, the liner RMS &quot;Aquitania&quot; was undergoing repairs in Gladstone Graving Dock. As a result, she was converted in situ for war service.
During the Second World War, ASW ships, Atlantic convoy escorts and minesweepers were based in the dock.
In 1942 the National Fire Service opened a fire station on Fort Road having a berth for some of its fireboats adjoining the NW Wall of the Dock, this remained open until 1946.

On 25 January 1953, the liner RMS &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; caught fire and capsized in Gladstone Number One Branch Dock. She was refloated the following year and towed to Gladstone Graving Dock to be made watertight, in preparation for being scrapped in Italy. Transatlantic passenger services continued to use the dock until all such services from Liverpool were discontinued in 1971.

The main line Gladstone Dock railway station closed to passengers on 7 July 1924 while the Liverpool Overhead Railway station Gladstone Dock (LOR) closed in 1956.

A new biomass terminal was built at the docks opening in 2015 with a second phase completed in 2016. Up to 10 trains per day will transport the biomass to power stations.
Until 2023, Gladstone Dock was also used by P&amp;O Ferries for their regular passenger and freight services from Liverpool to Dublin.
==Current use==
As part of Liverpool Freeport, Gladstone Dock&#x27;s principal uses are: importing coal for the adjacent Hornby Dock coal processing facility, importing biomass from North America at the biomass terminal and exporting scrap metal to the Far East.

<doc id="1129773" wikidata="Q213576" url="?curid=1129773" title="Huai River">
<text>The Huai River, formerly romanized as the Hwai, is a major river in East China, about long with a drainage area of . It is located about midway between the Yellow River and Yangtze River, the two longest rivers and largest drainage basins in China. Historically draining eastwards directly into the Yellow Sea, erosion from floods have changed the course of the river such that it now primarily discharges into the Yangtze. The Huai River is, to this day, notoriously vulnerable to flooding.

The Qinling–Huaihe Line, formed by the Huai River and the Qin Mountains, is sometimes regarded as the geographical dividing line between northern and southern China. This line approximates the January isotherm and the isohyet in China.

== Course ==
The Huai River originates in Tongbai Mountain in Henan province. It flows through southern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu where it pools into Lake Hongze.
Nowadays the Huai River then runs southwards as the Sanhe River by way of the Gaoyou Lake and Shaobo Lake, emptying into the Yangtze River at Sanjiangying (三江营) near Yangzhou.

There is also a passage called the Huaihe Sea Entryway and Subei Irrigation Canal that passes Huai&#x27;an and empties into the sea at Biandan Port. A separate course runs north by way of the Huaimu River and Huai Shu River and connects the Huai River system with the Xinyi River (part of the Yishusi River system) which exits into the sea at Guanyun in Lianyungang.

In part to circumvent flooding, in Jiangsu province the Huai River system is interconnected with different waterways and thereby forms part of the Grand Canal.

==History==

Historically, the Huai River entered the Yellow Sea at Yunti Pass (modern day Yunti Village, in Huangwei Town of Xiangshui County) through a broad and level lower course. It was long used to irrigate the surrounding farmlands, and was the center of an extensive network of canals and tributaries.
Beginning in 1194, however, the Yellow River to the north repeatedly changed its course southwards to run into the Huai River. The resulting silting was so heavy that after the Yellow River changed back to its northerly course for the most recent time in 1897, the geography of the Huai River basin was changed significantly by the creation of new high lands, lakes, and the built-up silt of the Yellow River&#x27;s historical southern course. As a result, water from the midsection of the river could not easily flow into the lower section, while water in the lower section could not find an outlet to the sea. The problem worsened in the Second World War, when the Nationalist government, in an attempt to check the pace of the Japanese invasion, flooded the lower Huai basin by opening the Yellow River&#x27;s southern levee. The main stem of the Yellow River flowed through the levee breach for the next nine years, further disrupting the Huai river system.

The result of these changes was that water from the Huai River pooled up into Lake Hongze, and then ran southwards towards the Yangtze River. Major and minor floods occurred frequently, with the area suffering droughts in between floods. In the 450 years to 1950, the Huai River saw, on average, 94 major floods per century.

Attempts to solve the Huai River&#x27;s problems have focused on building outlets for the Huai River into the Yangtze River and the sea. Currently, the major part of the river&#x27;s flow enters the Yangtze River via Lake Hongze. The North Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal also diverts some of its water along its old historical course to the sea, and is planned to be upgraded with a new parallel channel. Several former tributaries also carry some water to the sea.

==Tributaries==

There are many tributaries of the Huai River. There are 15 main tributaries cover an area of more than each, and 21 main tributaries have a catchment area larger than .
The main tributaries on the Huai River (listed from upstream to downstream) are as follows:

<text>White Waltham is a village and civil parish, west of Maidenhead, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is crossed briefly by the M4 motorway, which along with the Great Western Main Line and all other roads covers of the parish and &#x27;greenspace&#x27; which includes cultivated fields covers the most part - this covered (in January 2005) . White Waltham Airfield is in the parish.

==Extent==
In the south, the parish includes the hamlets of Paley Street and Littlefield Green. White Waltham village is clustered and sits in the mid-west of the parish. To the northeast is Woodlands Park, on the edge of Maidenhead, and the Maidenhead Business Park. In the northeast corner of the parish is Woolley Green and in the northwest, most of Littlewick Green.

==History==
The area was made up of a few manor houses, many of which evolved into country houses, for example Waltham Place, with its organic farm and gardens which are open to the public. The Church of England parish church of St Mary dates from Normans times, but has many fourteenth century and Victorian features. Frequent disputes as to the boundary between White Waltham and Bray occurred at intervals since 1286 and Thomas Hearne, historian, gives an account of the beating of the boundaries in his own life-time, mentioning all the place-names and commenting on &#x27;the insolence of the parishioners of Bray in transgressing their bounds.&#x27;

Sir Constantine Henry Phipps, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was buried at St. Mary in 1723. Thomas Hearne was born at Littlefield Green in 1678. Acquiring the patronage of the local lord of the manor, Francis Cherry, he rose to become assistant-keeper of the Bodleian Library in Oxford and the author of many important works. White Waltham School was established in 1828 and has been developed and expanded since, providing primary education for pupils between the ages of 5 and 11 and has legal academy status. The area had approximately half of the population in the late Victorian period but was overall significantly poorer in terms of real property. 
Today White Waltham has more than five times as many homes with 1,214. The area&#x27;s agriculture was noted as of high fertility justifying its protection after World War II. After World War II the south of White Waltham was proposed as land for Berkshire&#x27;s new town to rehouse Londoners made homeless by The Blitz. However, central and local government agreed in 1949 to use the alternative of Bracknell, as the White Waltham site would have encroached on good quality agricultural land, and was not on a railway.

==Carters Steam Fair==
In 1964, the famous &quot;Great Steam Fair&quot; was held for three days at Shottesbrooke Park near White Waltham. This is widely considered to be the forerunner of today&#x27;s steam and vintage rallies in England, such as the Great Dorset Steam Fair.

<doc id="1129789" wikidata="Q440597" url="?curid=1129789" title="Oswaldo Payá">
<text>Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas (29 February 1952 – 22 July 2012) was a Cuban political activist. A devout Catholic, he founded the Christian Liberation Movement in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule of the Cuban Communist Party. He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of assembly as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament&#x27;s Sakharov Prize and People in Need&#x27;s Homo Homini Award.

On 22 July 2012, he died in a car crash under mysterious circumstances. The Cuban government stated that the driver had lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree, while Payá&#x27;s children and one of the car&#x27;s passengers asserted that the car had been deliberately run off of the road. In 2023, a ruling by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) held the Cuban state responsible for the murder of Payá.

==Early life==
Oswaldo Payá was born on 29 February 1952 in Cerro, Havana. The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a Roman Catholic and attended a Marist Brothers school in Havana. Payá was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the Cuban Revolution. The school was later closed. In 1969, he was sentenced to three years of hard labor on Isla de Pinos when he refused to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service. While there, he discovered a locked Catholic church, Nuestra Señora de Dolores, that received permission from the Bishop of Havana to reopen as a mission, giving religious talks and caring for the sick.

After his release, Payá enrolled in the University of Havana as a physics major, but was expelled when authorities discovered him to be a practicing Christian; he then attended night school and switched his major to telecommunications. Payá later became an engineer and worked at a state surgical-equipment company. He was offered an opportunity to leave Cuba in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, but chose to remain in Cuba and work for change. He married Ofelia Acevedo in 1986 in a Catholic wedding. The pair had three children: Oswaldo José, Rosa María, and Reinaldo Isaías.

==Career==
===Varela Project===
In 1987, Payá founded the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL), which called for nonviolent civil disobedience against the rule of the Cuban Communist Party. The group advocates for civil liberties and freedom for political prisoners. He also began a magazine for Catholics titled &quot;People of God&quot; (&quot;Pueblo de Dios&quot;), calling for Christians to lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba&#x27;s bishops under government pressure. Payá attempted to run for the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power (NAPP) in 1992, but was not allowed to stand.

In the late 1990s, Payá and other MCL activists began collecting signatures for the Varela Project, a petition drive that would become his best-known program. Named in honor of Félix Varela, a Catholic priest who had participated in Cuba&#x27;s independence struggle with Spain, the Project took advantage of a clause in the Cuban Constitution requiring a national referendum to be held if 11,000 signatures are gathered.

In May 2002, Payá presented NAPP with 11,020 signatures calling for a referendum on safeguarding freedom of speech and assembly, allowing private business ownership, and ending one-party rule. On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter endorsed the petition when granted a chance to speak on Cuban television, bringing Payá&#x27;s efforts to the attention of a wide Cuban audience. Cuban President Fidel Castro described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the petition drive was &quot;the biggest nonviolent campaign to change the system the elder Castro established after the 1959 Cuban revolution&quot;, giving Payá an international reputation as a leading dissident. An expert described it as &quot;the only initiative of its time that enlisted citizen participation on a large scale&quot;. Fellow dissident Rene Gomez Manzano, on the other hand, was critical of the Project, stating that appeals to the Communist-Party-controlled NAPP were futile; similarly, other Cuban exiles criticized the initiative for what they considered its implicit acceptance of the legitimacy of the Castro regime and its constitution.

Later that year, Payá&#x27;s efforts were recognized by the European Parliament, which awarded him its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, although he was nearly denied an exit visa to attend the awards ceremony. In the months that followed, Payá met with Pope John Paul II, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Mexican President Vicente Fox to discuss the cause of Cuban democratic reform. The Varela Project progress was blocked when the government launched its own petition drive to declare the socialist state &quot;irrevocable&quot;. During the 2003 crackdown popularly known as the Black Spring, MCL members comprised around 40 of the 75 defendants, though Payá himself was not arrested.

===Later activism===
During Castro&#x27;s illness, which culminated in his 2008 resignation, Payá continued to criticize the Cuban government as it transferred power to Castro&#x27;s brother Raúl. He called on Raul Castro to allow multiparty elections and free all political prisoners, and delivered a petition asking that the Cuban people be granted freedom of travel.

In the years before Payá&#x27;s death, his influence was said to be waning, and attention shifted to younger activists such as blogger Yoani Sanchez. Leaked diplomatic cables from Jonathan D. Farrar, head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, described Payá and other older dissidents as &quot;hopelessly out of touch&quot;, writing, &quot;They have little contact with younger Cubans and, to the extent they have a message that is getting out, it does not appeal to that segment of society.&quot; However, many of the younger generation of dissidents cited him as a role model and expressed grief at his death.

==Political views==
===Opposition to United States groups and policy===
Payá refused to accept U.S. aid and also opposed the U.S. Cuban embargo. In a 2000 editorial for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, he stated that &quot;Lifting the embargo won&#x27;t solve the problems of the Cuban people. Maintaining it is no solution, either&quot;. He called on the U.S. to immediately lift the embargo on food and medicine.

He also maintained his distance from Cuban political groups based in the U.S. In particular, he refused to support their stated goal of land reacquisition upon the return of exiles to Cuba:
:&quot;It is not a neoliberal programme. For this, we are under attack by the powerful groups in Miami. When people say what is going to happen in Cuba after Fidel, we say – hold on, there are 11 million people in Cuba, not only Fidel Castro.&quot;

===Opposition to government cooperation===
In 2005, he also feuded with democracy activist Marta Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification for a further crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions he was allowed to travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: &quot;I have been told that I am going to be killed before the regime is over but I am not going to run away.&quot;

==Death==

Payá died in a car crash on 22 July 2012 at the age of 60. The incident occurred at 1:50 p.m. near Bayamo in eastern Granma province, according to a statement released by the Cuban government&#x27;s International Press Center. The chairman of the MCL&#x27;s youth league, Harold Cepero, also died in the crash. Swedish politician and chairman of the Young Christian Democrats Aron Modig and Spanish politician Ángel Carromero Barrios were present, but survived with minor injuries. All four were taken to Professor Carlos Manuel Clinical Surgery Hospital in Bayamo, though Payá was dead on arrival.
The car was driven by Carromero, well known in his country through his numerous but minor violations of traffic laws.
In late February 2014, the High Court of Spain upheld the decision of Judge Eloy Velasco, taken in September 2013, not to accept the complaint filed by the family of Oswaldo Payá against two senior Cuban military officers for the death of Payá. Carromero went on trial in Cuba, where he was convicted of non-planned murder.

At a press conference arranged by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Carromero denied this version of events, stating that he had been drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who had forced him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash.

Payá&#x27;s daughter Rosa María stated that her father died after the rental car in which he was traveling was rammed several times by another car. Payá&#x27;s son Oswaldo added that his father had received numerous death threats and stated that the accident&#x27;s survivors had reported that the car had been deliberately driven off the road. The official statement by the Cuban government stated that the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree. The MCL stated that &quot;the circumstances of these deaths have not been cleared up and are open to hypothesis&quot; and demanded a &quot;transparent&quot; inquiry into the accident. On 27 July, the Cuban Interior Ministry forwarded an official report to foreign press, blaming driver error and quoting Carromero as saying that the car had skidded off the road due to poor road conditions and bad weather. Payá&#x27;s widow rejected the report, stating that the crash was not an accident and that a government report could not be trusted.

U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement praising Payá as &quot;a tireless champion for greater civic and human rights in Cuba&quot;. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called for an independent investigation into the crash, imploring the international community to &quot;demand that the facts concerning Paya&#x27;s death be accurately determined and that the surviving witnesses be protected&quot;. The European Union issued a statement recognizing Payá&#x27;s dedication &quot;to the cause of democracy and human rights in Cuba&quot;. Elizardo Sanchez, president of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights, stated that &quot;This is tragic for the family and the human rights and pro-democracy movement in Cuba ... Payá was considered the most notable political leader of the Cuban opposition.&quot; Ladies in White president Berta Soler described the death as &quot;a terrible blow&quot;.

Payá&#x27;s funeral was held on 24 July 2012. Dissident groups reported that dozens of activists were arrested on their way to the funeral, including Félix Navarro Rodríguez and Guillermo Fariñas. A scuffle also broke out between activists and state security agents at the funeral itself. Amnesty International and the U.S. criticized the arrests, with the White House describing them as &quot;a stark demonstration of the climate of repression in Cuba.&quot; The dissidents arrested in Payá&#x27;s funerals were freed the following day.

In June 2023, the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled that the Cuban state was responsible for the murder of Oswaldo Payá and Harold Cepero, concluding that &quot;there were serious and sufficient indications to conclude that State agents directly participated in the deaths of Payá and Cepero&quot;, as well as responsible for violations of the due process right to and judicial guarantees of Ángel Carromero.

Oswaldo Payá&#x27;s daughter Rosa Maria has continued his activism for democratic reforms in Cuba.

<text>WTSH-FM 107.1, branded as La Raza 102.3/107.1, is an FM radio station in northwest Georgia, and reaching into northwest metro Atlanta, Georgia. Originally assigned to Rockmart, its city of license is now Aragon, west-northwest of Atlanta, and east of Rockmart. The broadcast licensee is Woman&#x27;s World Broadcasting and operated by Rome Radio Partners, LLC. From June 23, 2014 to September 24, 2018, it was operated by Cox Media Group via a local marketing agreement (LMA). The station&#x27;s supposed main studio is located on John Davenport Drive in Rome, Georgia.

On June 9, 2014, Women&#x27;s World Broadcasting announced it would turn over operation of country music &quot;South 107&quot; to Cox Media Group via an LMA. On June 22 of that year, WTSH ended its country format after over 25 years and began stunting with a liner redirecting listeners to WSRM FM as &quot;South 93.5&quot;. On June 23, Cox Media Group started to assume control of 107.1 via LMA. Upon Cox taking over at midnight, 107.1 then flipped to alternative rock as &quot;X107.1&quot;, similar to the then-recently launched &quot;X107.3&quot; in Orlando, Florida. The first song on X107.1 was &quot;Fever&quot; by The Black Keys. Despite mostly covering outside of the Atlanta metro area (even with the &quot;translator&quot; station&#x27;s coverage included), it identifies itself entirely as an Atlanta station during on-air promos. The station ID included all three stations at the top of each hour: &quot;WTSH-FM Aragon, W296BB Jonesboro, WSB-FM HD3 Atlanta&quot;.

Just over a year later, on June 29, 2015, WTSH went back to their heritage country format, simulcasting WNGC as &quot;106.1/107.1 Your Georgia Country&quot;. The change comes as X107.1 failed to gain any traction up against WRDA/WRDG generating only a 0.5 share in the May 2015 Nielsen Audio ratings.

On September 24, 2018, WTSH-FM (as a result of the LMA with Cox Media Group ending) switched from a simulcast with country-formatted WNGC to a simulcast with regional Mexican-formatted WLKQ-FM in Buford, branded as &quot;La Raza 102.3/107.1&quot;.

The LMA and the &quot;translator&quot; station allowed Cox to circumvent restrictions on the excessive concentration of media ownership in the Atlanta media market. Since the &quot;translator&quot; station is not attributable under the FCC rules, and the main station&#x27;s official service contour does not overlap Cox&#x27;s WSRV FM 97.1 to the northeast or that of Cox&#x27;s WALR-FM 104.1 to the southwest, it allows Cox to exceed the cap through technicalities and loopholes. Locally, Cox also owns WSB AM 750 and its simulcast on WSBB-FM 95.5, as well as WSB-FM 98.5, WSB-TV 39 (2.1 and 2.2), and the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;.

==Broadcast translators and station move==
WTSH-FM currently broadcasts with 100,000 watts from west-central Bartow County near Kingston, Georgia. In early May 2012, it applied to move to the WCCV FM 91.7 tower on Mullinax Mountain between Euharlee and Wax, Georgia, due west of Cartersville and southeast of Rome. This application was later dropped, and another filed in later July 2013 was for another location further southwest near Taylorsville, north-northwest of Rockmart. (Relative to metro Atlanta, this is two counties due west of Acworth.) , this application was still pending.

WTSH&#x27;s owner also purchased broadcast translator W296BB, also on 107.1, but licensed to serve Jonesboro, and previously rebroadcasting WMVV FM 90.7 within its own coverage area (with no terrain obstructions that would make such a translator necessary). It is now assigned to retransmit WSB-FM 98.5, indicating that HD3 digital subchannel now simulcasts WTSH, providing a legal fiction for circumventing the FCC rules which prohibit a translator or booster of a commercial radio station from reaching outside the main station&#x27;s legal broadcast range. A construction permit issued for W296BB allowed it to move to the WSB-TV 39 (DTV 2.1 &amp; 2.2) TV tower over Freedom Parkway just east of downtown Atlanta, increasing it from 13 to the maximum 250 watts, and using a directional antenna with a major null toward the northwest so as to reduce RF interference to WTSH. It went on-air in February 2014, making it at least the second station to be taken from Clayton county to retransmit another commercial station with an already-good signal in the area (the other being W275BK FM 102.9 from Riverdale).

The two stations are synchronized as a single-frequency network, the same way a booster station would be. This means that the stations transmit the same audio at exactly the same time, intended to make for a nearly seamless transition for listeners. The main indication is static, most often occurring around southeastern Cobb county, near the Chattahoochee River and the northwestern part of the Perimeter (I-285 around Atlanta). This is due to the two stations being around the same signal strength in this area, and the numerous hills, which causes the relative levels of the two to rapidly oscillate back and forth (picket-fencing) when travelling at freeway speeds. Slower speeds or stationary listening may actually be more difficult, as the listener is stuck in small pockets of poor reception for longer periods. The zone of RF interference moves hourly and daily based on weather and overnight temperature inversions, which affect radio propagation, especially over the longer distance from the main station. The two stations may also have their actual carrier waves synchronized via GPS for further stability, and to avoid phase cancellation, but as a matter of physics it is impossible to avoid the switching caused by FM&#x27;s capture effect.

In 2003, an application was made for another translator station in Rome on 98.7 by Broadcast Investment Associates. This station, which took the FCC a decade to approve, received a construction permit in December 2013, after a reapplication four months prior. Given broadcast callsign W254CF, it also listed WTSH-FM as its primary station, and still shows a location with the city limits just northwest of downtown Rome along Martha Berry Highway (U.S. 27 and Georgia 1). Previously illegal to retransmit a non-FM station, W254CF is now directly assigned to simulcast WRGA AM 1470, another Rome Radio Partners property.

WTSH previously had translator W269CC FM 101.7 in Adairsville, which now rebroadcasts WJTH AM 900 in Calhoun, both in upper northwest Georgia.

===FA Premier League===
After 3 seasons of missing out, Manchester United fought off the challenge of Chelsea and regained the Premier League title for the 9th time in 15 years. Despite finishing second, the Blues claimed a League Cup and FA Cup double, and Didier Drogba was the top flight&#x27;s leading goalscorer with 20 in the league. The final two Champions League places went to Liverpool (who nearly won the competition for the 2nd time in 3 seasons only to lose out to A.C. Milan, the same opponents from the final 2 years previous) and Arsenal. Tottenham and Everton qualified for the UEFA Cup, as did Bolton, despite the departure of long-serving manager Sam Allardyce shortly before the end of the season. Blackburn qualified for the Intertoto Cup thanks to the 18 goals of striker Benni McCarthy as well as the impressive efforts of manager Mark Hughes.

Newly promoted Reading, tipped by many critics for relegation, defied the odds by finishing 8th on their first ever season in the top flight. Portsmouth put last season&#x27;s managerial debacle behind them to finish 9th, finishing just 2 points short of European qualification. Aston Villa&#x27;s campaign, their first under former Celtic manager Martin O&#x27;Neill, marked an improvement on the previous campaign which saw them go undefeated in their first nine and last nine matches, although a staggering 17 draws prevented a top-half finish.

Watford finished bottom, managing only 5 wins all season as they made a swift return to the Championship. The loss of Alan Curbishley and 3 managerial changes in Iain Dowie, Les Reed and then Alan Pardew ended Charlton Athletic&#x27;s 7-year stay in the top flight. Ironically, Curbishley took charge at West Ham, another London club who looked certain for the drop after a poor season. However, a run of seven wins from their final nine matches was enough to secure their Premiership status, with a goal from Carlos Tevez giving the Hammers victory over champions Manchester United at Old Trafford, while sending Sheffield United down and beginning speculation from the Yorkshire club over whether Tevez was eligible to play. The matter was eventually settled out of court, with West Ham fined £5.5 million by the Premier League and ordered to pay the Blades compensation over five years. Wigan Athletic, in their second year in the top flight, narrowly avoided relegation on goal difference.

Leading goalscorer: Didier Drogba (Chelsea) – 20

===Football League Championship===

After losing their first four games, Sunderland looked ominous for a second relegation. The surprise appointment of Roy Keane by rookie chairman Niall Quinn paid off and they surged up the table, losing just one of their final 20 games to clinch promotion as champions. Keane&#x27;s former Manchester United colleague, Steve Bruce also took Birmingham City back into the Premier League, ensuring that they only remained in the Championship for one season.

Derby County spent half the season in the top 2, but fell away in the final weeks to slip into the play-off places. Nonetheless, they won promotion by beating West Bromwich Albion 1–0 in the final at the recently opened new Wembley Stadium. This denied the Baggies an immediate return to the Premier League, which would have meant all 3 relegated clubs from the previous season were promoted.

Preston were perhaps the biggest chokers as they lost 5 of their final 7 games to slump out of the play-off places they had occupied through the bulk of the season, missing out on a third successive play-off finish. Cardiff City had been the early pace-setters, leading the table up until the midway point before their form tailed off badly in the second half.

After a play-off final appearance the previous year, Leeds finished bottom amidst yet more financial worries and acrimony, falling into the relegation zone in early October and, despite a late improvement, never leaving it. Their placing at the foot of the table was due to a 10-point deduction they suffered after going into voluntary administration after their relegation was all but confirmed on the penultimate weekend. The club came close to being expelled from the Football League during the summer after being unable to agree a deal with their creditors, but they were allowed to remain for the following season, albeit with a 15-point deduction. Regardless, it meant they would spend next season competing outside of the top two divisions for the first time in their history.

Luton, who would have finished bottom but for Leeds&#x27;s deduction, were relegated after being forced to sell many of their top players due to mounting financial problems. They had spent the first half of the season safely in mid-table, but a disastrous run of form after the turn of the year saw them relegated back to League One after just two seasons. Southend lasted only a single season in the Championship after their two successive promotions; their season was essentially the opposite of Luton&#x27;s, winning just three games until the turn of the year before an improvement in form gave them some hope. Colchester fared best of the newly promoted clubs, comfortably finishing in 10th, largely on the back of their strong home form at the division&#x27;s smallest stadium, Layer Road.

&quot;Leading goalscorer:&quot; Jamie Cureton (Colchester United) – 23

===Football League One===

With club physiotherapist Nigel Adkins promoted to the manager&#x27;s role, Scunthorpe United topped the league as champions, having been in the bottom two divisions since the early 1960s. Prolific striker Billy Sharp was the also the division&#x27;s leading marksman with 30 goals. Gary Johnson helped Bristol City achieve automatic-promotion after nearly a decade of near-misses and 2 play-off defeats, ending their eight-year exile from the Championship. Blackpool won the play-offs, ending nearly three decades in the bottom two divisions.

Brentford, who lost their manager Martin Allen just before the start of the season, finished bottom, having a dismal run of 21 games without a win. Rotherham won their first few games, wiping out their ten-point deduction early in the season; they ended up finishing thirteen points adrift however, and were relegated. Having started the decade in the Premier League, Bradford City fell into the bottom division for the first time in twenty-five years, with Chesterfield occupying the final relegation spot.

Leading goalscorer: Billy Sharp (Scunthorpe United) – 30

===Football League Two===

The four teams relegated from League One in 2005–06 would occupy the top four this season, sending Walsall, Hartlepool United and Swindon Town back up. Bristol Rovers won the play-offs however, returning to League One after six years.

Torquay United had been both the last team to finish bottom under the old election system, and the last team to finish bottom of the League and survive due to the Conference champions not having a good enough ground. However, this season they finished bottom and dropped out of the League. They were joined by Boston United, who had voluntary arrangements in the 87th minute of the season&#x27;s final game, but would still have been relegated even without the 10-point administration penalty. In a first since the introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and Conference, Boston were relegated two divisions due to failing to pay footballing creditors, along with financial irregularities committed during their promotion season in 2001–02.

Leading goalscorer: Izale McLeod (Milton Keynes Dons) – 21

==Monthly awards==
==Transfer deals==

The summer transfer window saw many high-profile moves. These included Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack joining Chelsea, and Ruud van Nistelrooy leaving Manchester United to join Real Madrid. West Ham United secured the surprise double signing of Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez from Corinthians, and Dietmar Hamann&#x27;s transfer to Bolton Wanderers became the shortest in English footballing history.

The January transfer window was quieter than the summer, with Ashley Young&#x27;s £9.65m move to Aston Villa and Matthew Upson&#x27;s £6m move to West Ham United the window&#x27;s most expensive.

In total, Premiership clubs spent the highest amount on transfers in the summer since the transfer window system was introduced.

<doc id="1129805" wikidata="Q4832951" url="?curid=1129805" title="Bijan Jazani">
<text>Bijan Jazani (Persian: بیژن جَزنی, also spelled &quot;&quot;Bizhan&quot; Jazani&quot;; January 9, 1938, in Tehran – April 19, 1975) was an Iranian political activist and a significant figure among modern Iranian Socialist intellectuals. A Marxist theorist, Jazani was one of the founders of the Organization of Iranian People&#x27;s Fedai Guerrillas.

==Personal and political life==

Bijan Jazani was born to Hossien Jazani (حسین جزنی) and Alamtaj Kalantari Nazari (عالمتاج کلانتری نظری). He came from a politically active background; both of his parents&#x27; families were involved with the Tudeh Party during a period of political openness from Reza Shah&#x27;s exile until the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh. The children of these families were drawn to and eventually joined the Tudeh youth movement. Over time, they took on increasingly significant roles within the party. Jazani&#x27;s father, a military officer, became a member of the Tudeh Party in 1945, while his mother, Alamtaj Kalantari, was active in the Women&#x27;s Tudeh Party.

In 1947, when Bijan Jazani was nine years old, his father joined the Azerbaijan Democratic Party. In the same year, with the fall of Pishevari, his father left for the Soviet Union and remained there until 1967. For this reason, Alamtaj Kalantari took Bijan Jazani and his sisters to her parents&#x27; home.

This period had a significant impact on the future political life of Jazani. He lived in a household whose members had a professional role in the Tudeh party. During this time, his mother expanded her activities in the women&#x27;s Tudeh party. Jazani, alongside his uncle, who was two years older than he was, joined the Tudeh Youth Organization in 1948 at the age of 10. After the Tudeh party became illegal on February 4, 1949, Jazani continued participation in the youth party. He was then chosen as the messenger of the youth organization because of his young age and family background. But the hidden activities of the Tudeh party and the affiliated organizations did not last long, and from 1951, the activities slowly became semi-transparent. In addition to this, the leaders of the Tudeh and the youth organization created the &quot;Iranians in Favour of Peace&quot;, &quot;National Organization in the Struggle against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Corporation&quot;, &quot;Democratic Youth Organizations&quot;, and the &quot;Student Organization of Tehran&quot;. Jazani began his activities in the &quot;Student Organization of Tehran&quot; in 1951–1952 and was initially responsible for a small group. In 1953 he became semi-responsible for this organization. He was also active in the circulation and sale of student newspapers. He began a gym in 1951, which helped students and developed into a place for recruiting members into the youth organization. 

These activities continued—except in a short two-month period with the death of his sister Manijeh (منیژه)—until the coup d&#x27;état of August 19, 1953 (٢٨ مرداد سال ١٣٣٢). Jazani was arrested in December 1953 because of his political activities but gave the name Hossein Mahmoodi (حسین محمودی) to the court and, after three months in prison at a military court, was released under bond. He continued his political activities but was arrested in May 1954 at an organization gathering—disguised under a wedding ceremony—and again gave a false name and was released under bond. In the fall of the same year, he was summoned concerning the incident of December 1953 and served a 6-month prison term. 

After release from prison, he focused on family while keeping true to his political views. He wasn&#x27;t allowed back to high school, so he joined the art school of Kamal-ol-Molk. He created the Persepolis Advertising Company (کانون اگهی پرسپولیس) with the help of a friend. The company advertised in the form of paintings for local merchants. Jazani drew the paintings, leaving the business side to his friend. The success of the company led to the creation of the Nabl Film Institution (موسسه نبلی فیلم) in the late 1950s. The company developed TV advertising in Iran and gave financial stability to Jazani. 

In 1959, with his company making enough money, he returned to his studies and received his diploma. The following year he signed up for the philosophy program at the University of Tehran. At this time, after eight years of close friendship with his childhood friend and member of the youth organization, Mihan Ghoreishy (میهن قریشی), he married her on October 13, 1960. The result of the marriage was two sons, Babak (بابک) and Mazyar—alias Maximilien (مازیار). 

From the years 1956 until 1959, Jazani had no political activities. In this matter, his wife wrote: in these years, &quot;We had no thoughts of a political future, we relied on our love and in the advancement of our studies. We spent most of our free time reading and at the theaters&quot;. In 1959, he returned to politics and created a magazine named &quot;Nedaye Khalgh&quot; (&quot;ندای خلق&quot;), intending to unite the political groups against the coup d&#x27;état regime. However, in the winter of 1959, the magazine&#x27;s circulation was halted because of the tight political climate.

==Activity in political climate==
When Jazani entered the University of Tehran, the country faced political and economic problems that led to a retreat for the Shah. These problems were caused by the inabilities of the Shah&#x27;s economic policies and the extreme military expenses that began after the Coup d&#x27;état in 1953. In the spring of 1960, due to mounting debt and inflation, the government of Iran requested immediate financial assistance from the World Bank and the government of the United States. The World Bank demanded the Iranian government to fix budget problems, reduce salaries, and balance specific economic plans to receive 35 million dollars of assistance. The administration of John F. Kennedy also demanded political and economic reform in the Shah&#x27;s government for 85 million dollar assistance. However, financial problems and external pressure to perform the reforms led to the regime&#x27;s instability. The Shah, to deal with this problem, announced the elections of the 20th Majlis would be accessible to all organizations. Although this promise did not come to reality, it showed the retreat of the regime and the opening of a political climate in Iran. The leaders of the Iranian National Front (جبهه ملی ایران) officially announced the existence of the second national front movement and began their activities.

Jazani and his followers slowly moved from the Tudeh party to the student and national front organizations because of their interest in the guerrilla movement in Latin America. Jazani began participating in the student movement at the University of Tehran.

==Payam Daneshjoo==
In early fall of 1963, Jebhe Melli Daneshjoo (سازمان دانشجویان جبهه ملی ایران), which after the resistance in Baharestan Ave, had lost hope to the politics of &quot;patience and hope&quot;; with the help of officials and leaders of the National Front (Iran) (جبهه ملی ایران) selected a new leader for this movement. This led to the creation of the third national movement in the year 1965 and the publication Payam Daneshjoo (نشریه پیام دانشجو) in the fall of 1963—published initially under Jebhe Melli Daneshjoo. Up to March 1964, Hassan Habiby was the editor responsible for collecting information, articles, and news, while Jazani was in charge of the publication process. In the spring of 1964, a committee was selected to run the publication made up of all factions of the student movement. Hooshang Keshavarz Sadr, Matin Daftari, Majeed Ahsan, and Mansoor Soroush were part of this committee. Jazani was in charge of publication, and Behzad Nabavi (بهزاد نبوی) was responsible for circulation. Jazani did the preliminary work related to the print at home. The printing was done on a handmade copy machine. Jazani had rented a hidden house for this purpose and had a significant role in all stages of the process, from financial to print.

By the spring of 1965, roughly 500 copies were published, and Bahmanpour Shareaty spread a number of them to officials of different universities in the Tehran province and others circulated by Matin Daftari and Dariush Forouhar in non-university-related locations. In this period, almost all of the process, from writing articles up to publication, was done by leftist student movements (Jazani&#x27;s group, Tudeh (توده), loyalists of Maleki, and loyalists of Shoaeeyan). Jazani wrote several articles explaining the ideology of his movement in the publication. The activities of the third national movement had increasingly worried SAVAK (ساواک). On May 22, 1965, Savak arrested Mostafa Mallad and Bahmanpour Shareaty. In the afternoon of that same day, they arrested Jazani and several organizers of the student movement, such as Majeed Ahsan, Shireen Sour Esrafeel, and Manoochehr Taghavee. These arrests signalled the end of political freedom in Iran under Shah&#x27;s regime, ending the third national movement in 1965. It seems that SAVAK was unaware of the role of Jazani in the publication of Payam Daneshjoo since the arrest was on charges related to participation in the circulation of the publication. The main reason for this mistake by SAVAK was Jazani&#x27;s concealed presence in the publication. After his arrest, some of his friends, such as Iraj Vahedeepour, to show that Jazani had no role in the publication, continued the publication for a couple of issues after his arrest. Even so, Jazani and other student activists remained in prison until February 1966, when the court ruled a 9-month sentence but was immediately released given that he had already served his time in prison.

After prison, Jazani continued his studies and 1966 graduated with a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Tehran.

==Guerrilla movement==
Jazani, after being released from prison with all his power, began developing and organizing his movement. In the spring of 1966, Hassan Zia-Zarifi was added to the group and, with his recommendation, united the organization with the Razm Avaran organization. Razm Avaran was organized by Abbass Sourky in 1959, and its members in the years before 1953 were members of the Tudeh party until February 15, 1960, when for promotion and circulation of the party in universities were arrested, supported the ideologies of the Tudeh party. But in 1964, when Sourky again organized Razm Avaran, not only did he not want to associate with the Tudeh party, but supported the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. The recommendation of Hassan Zia-Zarifi, due to the characteristics of Sourky, such as inexperience, crowded work, and his past affiliations that led to him being arrested, caused the central authority of the group to be uninterested in this prospect. But, internal problems such as the impatience of members during the long development process, which showed when Keyoumars Ezadi left the group, led to the decision to negotiate between the two groups. Even though in the negotiations between Jazani, Zarifi, and Saeed Kalantari Nazari by Sourky and Zarar Zahedian, there was significant uncertainty to Sourky had been developed by Jazani; the prospect of adding 120 ready members and a large number of explosives and artillery finally led to the merger of the Razm Avaran group with the Jazani group in fall 1966.

There were significant problems with this merger. The 120 ready members did not take the organization seriously and were spread from the central group. Of the members of Razm Avaran, only Sourky and Zahedian met the regulations that would allow members to join the military wing and the central authority. The others became part of the reserve units of the group. One of these members was Naser Aghayan, who, from 1963, participated with the SAVAK and gave details of Razm Avaran&#x27;s plan and members. After the merger between the two groups, Aghayan gave reports of the activities of Jazani&#x27;s group to SAVAK.

==Ideology of Jazani&#x27;s group==
Jazani, with respect to the group&#x27;s views, writes: &quot;The experience of group members in Marxist-Leninist activities previous to joining the group led to it being known as followers of the Marxist-Leninist ideology without any discussion&quot;. But they were different from other organizations of their time, such as Tudeh, Jebheh Engelabi, etc., in this ideology. What was important for Jazani and his followers was to have an independent understanding of Marxism-Leninism without influence from China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, their key goal and what shaped their views was to do what benefited the people of Iran. For example, their position on the Soviet Union, which called itself the leader of the world communist movement, was based on this viewpoint. They began with the idea that a country&#x27;s foreign policy is a result of the social values of its regime. This policy reflects the benefits of the leadership level (consisting of a class system) and reflects the ruling class&#x27;s ideology. Therefore, a socialist government must be loyal to the goals of Marxist-Leninist and international pluralism. In this setting, they came up to the following conclusion regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and Iran: &quot;In our opinion the policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in Iran opposes the growth and revolutionary struggle Asian countries against Imperialism and is in conflict with the chief idea of international pluralism and socialist diplomacy.&quot;

In this vision, Jazani explained the relationship between the group and the Soviet Union: &quot;The group had many reasons not to be happy with the idea of the Soviet Union being the leader of the world&#x27;s revolutionary movements. The Soviet Unions policies in Iran in the past twenty years and the few years of bad relations between the Soviet Union and the Tudeh party were known to the members of the group.&quot; It was because of this that Jazani concluded when seeing the relationship of the Soviet Union and Tudeh and Eastern Europe at the end of the decade of 1950 that: &quot;... if the left movement wins the struggle in Iran, it must be aware of the Soviet Union&#x27;s wanting of power. Failing to do so will lead to Iran becoming another satellite of the Soviets.&quot; Jazani said that if the power of the leftist movement falls in the hands of the Soviets before anything else, it will get rid of us. He believed that geographically Iran was too close to the Soviet Union to ignorantly come close to it without understanding the harms involved.

==Arrest and prison life==
In early 1968, the organization&#x27;s activities had reached a stalemate mainly due to a lack of funds. So the group decided to gain the required money from robbing banks. Their first attempt at this was on January 12, 1968, but three days before that date, Aghayan notified the SAVAK of the group&#x27;s plans. This led to Jazani and Sourky&#x27;s arrest and other organization members&#x27; hiding. The arrest of Shahrzad, whose location was notified to the Savak by Aghayan, led to the arrests of Izadi, Rashidi, Ahsan, Farokh Negahdar and others. In addition, five other members of the group (Zarifi, Jaleel Afshar, Choopan Zadeh, Saeed Kalantari Nazari, and Keyanzad) were arrested by the SAVAK with the assistance of Abbas-Ali Shahryari and his organization.

Even though the organization&#x27;s key members had been arrested, the group was not destroyed. Safaii Farahani and Safari Ashtiani left Iran and joined the Palestinian organization Fatah. After returning to Iran, Farahani and Safari, organized the Siahkal (سياهکل) uprising on February 8, 1971. Shortly after that, the remaining members of the group, including Hamid Ashraf and Masoud Ahmadzadeh, reorganized and renamed it to Iranian People&#x27;s Fadaee Guerrillas (چريك فداييان خلق ايران).

In February 1969, Jazani&#x27;s group was indicted in military court. Jazani was sentenced to life for participating in an organization against the monarchy and carrying an illegal weapon, which was later reduced to 15 years. The sentences for other members varied, ranging from 2 to 10 years. The group&#x27;s members were at Gasr prison until spring 1969, when Saeed Kalantari Nazari, Sourky, Sarmady, and Choopan Zadeh attempted to escape from prison. This led to the relocation of most group members to rural areas. Jazani was sent to Qom with ordinary prisoners. Because of the respect of the correctional officers towards Jazani, he was allowed to spend most of his time in the prison library studying and painting.

In this period, Jazani, with the assistance of his wife, gets in contact with the unknown members of the group and guides them in an ideological sense. In the summer of 1970, he wrote &quot;What a revolutionary must know&quot; and signed it in the name of Safaii Farahani to help Safaii strengthen his position in the group. When Siahkal occurred, through interrogation of the participants by SAVAK, they found out about the relationship between Jazani and the group. In March 1971, SAVAK brought Jazani to Tehran. From then on, Jazani remained in Tehran and was located between other political prisoners. In Tehran, he increases his activities in prison. Jazani believed that prison is a piece of the action outside and, therefore, must reflect the group&#x27;s policies.

Jazani lived his life in prison based on this. With the help of his wife and other prisoners, he developed contact with the Iranian People&#x27;s Fadaee Guerrillas outside of prison and created a leftist movement inside prison. The responsibility of this movement was to organize resistance, manage activities, and teaching political and ideological to leftist prisoners and recruit Iranian People&#x27;s Fadaee Guerrillas. The action of Jazani caused problems from two sides in prison. The officials of SAVAK, who thought of Jazani as a significant problem in prison, attempted to stop him from his activities. On the other side, leftist prisoners who disagreed with Jazani acted in various ways against Jazani&#x27;s activities. SAVAK also created problems between these leftist factions.

Most of those against Jazani were the followers of Masoud Ahmadzadeh and Amir Parviz Pooyan, two of the founders of Iranian People&#x27;s Fadaee Guerrillas. Although these two individuals were killed in 1972, their teachings were the official teachings of the movement up to 1976. Jazani thought these two individuals&#x27; teachings were distractive, and his book &quot;Armed struggle in Iran: The Road to Mobilization of the Masses&quot; was written in response to a book written by Ahmadzadeh &quot;Armed struggle, Both Tactic and Strategy&quot;. Even though Jazani did not mention Parviz Pooyan or Ahmadzadeh in his book, when discussing and offering his thoughts, he disapproves of those provided by these two individuals. Even though there were significant differences between the teachings of Jazani and Ahmadzadeh, two focal items were discussed between these two schools of thought. These were the revolutionary situation of the country and the method of struggle. The ones that disagreed with Jazani and approved of Ahmadzadeh were under the belief that the government was in a revolutionary status and situations for a revolution existed. Therefore, a guerrilla fighter must fight with artillery to make the people aware of the extreme status of the country. A smaller motor, the military uprising will turn a larger engine, the population, and the larger population will support the military uprising and bring down the Shah&#x27;s government. In Ahmadzadeh&#x27;s opinion, not believing the revolutionary situation shows a sense of individualism, which in the opinion of the leftist movement, is that of a traitor.

Jazani would explain that a revolutionary status does not exist in the country, and in addition to that, a revolution does not result from armed struggle. Instead, it comes about as a political, social, economic, and ideological development. A military uprising should be staged at the time of- and not before the revolution, as it does not cause a process by itself. In his opinion, those who are for a military uprising are similar to the Shah, who is blocking a peaceful means of struggle. Because of this, without talking about Ahmadzadeh, Jazani wrote, &quot;When we hear that revolution begins with a military uprising, we have to say that the believers of this train of thought do not know two things: one the current situation of military uprising and second revolution in general and the revolution we want is a specific one.&quot;

The second major problem was the method of struggle. Ahmadzadeh believed that the only means of battle was a military one and had a strategic role in their fight. On the other hand, Jazani felt in the current situation, one should not limit their means to one method, but we should prepare the people in a political sense from all sides. Even though Jazani attempted to resolve issues through dialogue and unite the various leftist factions, his opponents dismantled the leftist movement in prison to decrease Jazani&#x27;s influence. Even so, Jazani remained active to the end of his life when he was murdered alongside eight other prisoners on April 19, 1975, by Savak. Bahman Naderipour, a SAVAK agent and closely involved with the executions, described that day&#x27;s events:

We took the prisoners to the high hills above Evin. They were blindfolded, and their hands were tied. We got them off the minibus and had them sit on the ground. Then, Attarpour told them that, just as your friends have killed our comrades, we have decided to execute you—the brain behind those executions. Jazani and the others began protesting. I do not know whether Attarpour or Colonel Vaziri first pulled out a machine gun and started shooting them. I do not remember whether I was the 4th or 5th person to whom they gave the machine gun. I had never done that before. In the end, Sa&#x27;di Jalil Esfahani [another SAVAK agent, Babak] shot them in their heads [to ensure they were dead].[1]

There are suggestions that Naderipour might have been tortured after being detained by the revolutionary government. Therefore, the details of his narrative, obtained under duress, are questionable by all standards. The circumstance of Bijan Jazani&#x27;s death will remain a mystery. The only truth that remains is that he was killed by execution shortly before finishing his sentence. All of Jazani&#x27;s books were written in prison from 1970 to 1974. They discussed establishing the independent leftist movement in the two decades of the 1960s and &#x27;70s. Jazani is buried in the 33rd block of Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.

<doc id="1129809" wikidata="Q376062" url="?curid=1129809" title="Sigmar Polke">
<text>Sigmar Polke (13 February 1941 – 10 June 2010) was a German painter and photographer. Polke experimented with a wide range of styles, subject matters and materials. In the 1970s, he concentrated on photography, returning to paint in the 1980s, when he produced abstract works created by chance through chemical reactions between paint and other products. In the last 20 years of his life, he produced paintings focused on his perception of historical events.

==Life==
Polke, the seventh in a family of eight children, was born in Oels in Lower Silesia. He fled with his family to Thuringia in 1945, during the expulsion of Germans after World War II. His family escaped from the Communist regime in East Germany in 1953, traveling first to West Berlin and then to West Germany Rhineland.

Upon his arrival in West Germany, in Willich near Krefeld, Polke began to spend time in galleries and museums and worked as an apprentice in a stained glass factory in Düsseldorf between 1959 and 1960, before entering the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (Arts Academy) at age twenty. From 1961 to 1967 he studied at the Düsseldorf Arts Academy under Karl Otto Götz, Gerhard Hoehme and deeply influenced by his teacher Joseph Beuys. He began his creative output during a time of enormous social, cultural, and artistic changes in Germany and elsewhere. During the 1960s, Düsseldorf, in particular, was a prosperous, commercial city and an important centre of artistic activity. In the early 1970s Polke lived at the Gaspelhof, an artists&#x27; commune.

From 1977 to 1991, he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Hamburg. His students included, among others, Georg Herold. He settled in Cologne in 1978, where he continued to live and work until his death in June 2010 after a long battle with cancer.

==Work==
In 1963, Polke founded the painting movement &quot;Kapitalistischer Realismus&quot;
(&quot;Capitalist realism&quot;) with Gerhard Richter and Konrad Fischer (alias Konrad Lueg as artist). It is an anti-style of art, appropriating the pictorial shorthand of advertising. This title also referred to the realist style of art known as &quot;Socialist Realism&quot;, then the official art doctrine of the Soviet Union and its satellites (from one of which Polke had fled with his family), but it also commented upon the consumer-driven art &quot;doctrine&quot; of western capitalism. He also participated in &quot;Demonstrative Ausstellung&quot;, a store-front exhibition in Düsseldorf with Manfred Kuttner, Lueg, and Richter (11 - 26 May 1963). Essentially a self-taught photographer, Polke spent the next three years painting, experimenting with filmmaking and performance art.

===Photography===
In 1966–68, during his most conceptual period, Polke used a Rollei camera to capture ephemeral arrangements of objects in his home and studio. In 1968, the year after he left the art academy, Polke published these images as a portfolio of 14 photographs of small sculptures he had made from odds and ends—buttons, balloons, a glove. From 1968 to 1971, he completed several films and took thousands of photographs, most of which he could not afford to print.

During the 1970s, Polke slowed his art production in favor of travel to Afghanistan, Brazil, France, Pakistan, and the U.S., where he shot photographs (using a handheld 35mm Leica camera) and film footage that he would incorporate in his subsequent works during the 1980s. In 1973 he visited the U.S. with artist James Lee Byars in search of the &quot;other&quot; America; the fruit of that journey was a series of manipulated images of homeless alcoholics living on New York&#x27;s Bowery. He produced an additional series of photographic suites based on his journeys to Paris (1971), Afghanistan and Pakistan (1974) and São Paulo (1975), often treating the original image as raw material to be manipulated in the dark room, or in the artist&#x27;s studio. Beginning with his 1971 Paris photographs printed using chemical staining to create works full of strange presences while under the influence of LSD, Polke exploited the photographic process as a means to alter &quot;reality.&quot; He combined both negatives and positives with images that had both vertical and horizontal orientations. The resulting collage-like compositions take advantage of under- and overexposure and negative and positive printing to create enigmatic narratives. With the negative in his enlarger, the artist developed large sheets selectively, pouring on photographic solutions and repeatedly creasing and folding the wet paper.

Completed in 1995 in collaboration with his later wife Augustina von Nagel, a suite of 35 prints entitled &quot;Aachener Strasse&quot; combine street photography with images from Polke&#x27;s paintings, developed using techniques of multiple exposures and multiple negatives.

===Painting===

Polke&#x27;s early work has often been characterised as European Pop art for its depiction of everyday subject matter—sausages, bread and potatoes—combined with images from the mass media. His &quot;Rasterbilder&quot; from that period are works that exploit the raster-dot technique of printing as a way as of subverting and bringing into question the apparent truth, validity and purpose of the media images that his paintings appropriate. He imitated the dotted effect of commercial newsprint by painstakingly painting each dot with the rubber at the end of a pencil. In works such as &quot;Carl Andre in Delft&quot; (1968), the Propellerfrau (1969) or, later, &quot;Protective Custody&quot; (1978) Polke used a canvas made of furnishing fabric, thus elevating it to the status of a visual motif. His creative output during this time of enormous social, cultural, and artistic changes in Germany and elsewhere, demonstrate most vividly his imagination, sardonic wit, and subversive approach in his drawings, watercolors, and gouaches produced during the 1960s and 1970s. Embedded in these images are incisive and parodic commentaries on consumer society, the postwar political scene in Germany, and classic artistic conventions.

Returning to painting in the 1980s, he maintained his interest in alchemical properties. In 1980, he began exploring Australia and Southeast Asia, working with materials like arsenic, meteor dust, smoke, uranium rays, lavender, cinnabar and a purple pigment from the mucus excreted by snails. He began to make large, gestural paintings which combined figurative and abstract imagery. During the 1980s he experimented with materials and chemicals, mixing together traditional pigments with solvents, varnishes, toxins and resins to produce spontaneous chemical reactions. These experiments produced elaborate abstract paintings which reflect on the concepts of originality and authorship which underpin the Modernist tradition and, in particular, the mystique of American Abstract Expressionism. A complicated &quot;narrative&quot; is often implicit in the multi-layered picture, giving the effect of witnessing the projection of a hallucination or dream through a series of veils. Polke often soaked the fabric for his paintings in resin to make it transparent. He also painted the coloured shapes on the back, so they show through as shadowy forms. By pouring colour substances on a laid out canvas and directing the process only to a restricted degree through swaying the picture&#x27;s surface, Polke surrenders the task of pictorial invention to the colours themselves.

In 1994, he produced &quot;The Three Lies of Painting&quot;, where a landscape containing a mountain and a tree is intercut with abstract devices before succumbing to the intrusive presence of a large, vertical strip of printed fabric. It is festooned with multicoloured hands, suggesting once again that Polke wants to emphasise the artist&#x27;s own manipulative. In the mid-1990s Polke began to work on a new series called Druckfehler, or &#x27;Printing Mistakes&#x27;, inspired by printing errors found in newspapers. Fascinated by the relationship between the random mistake and the original image, Polke would enlarge and manipulate the distorted newsprint. He then paints the image onto a polyester surface with the aid of a projector, and coats it in layers of resin. Buried within this elaborate surface are sheets of gold mesh, creating yet another filter through which the image must be read. In a few cases, Polke &quot;manufactured&quot; these so-called mistakes; the elongated figures in &quot;Aus &#x27;Lernen neu zu Lernen&#x27; (From &#x27;Learning to Learn Anew&#x27;)&quot; (1998) are the result of his having dragged a picture through a photocopier.

In 2002, Polke developed a new technique of &#x27;machine painting&#x27;. These are his first completely mechanically-produced paintings and are made by tinting and altering images on a computer and then photographically transferring them onto large sheets of fabric. Up until this point Polke had rejected mechanical processes, preferring to explore the visual effects of mechanical technology by hand.

From 2007, Polke continued to develop and refine his &quot;Lens Paintings&quot; series. The conceptual framework of the Lens Paintings is grounded in theories set forth by monk Johann Zahn in a 1685 book on a &quot;teledioptric artificial eye&quot;, a forerunner of the telephoto lens. Polke&#x27;s painted &quot;lens&quot; generates a variety of distortions, mutations and spatial illusions when seen from different viewpoints.

===Films===
When asked to participate in Konrad Fischer&#x27;s museum exhibition &quot;Konzeption/Conception&quot; (1969) at Museum Morsbroich, Polke suggested he make a film in which he scratches himself and uses a pendulum. The resulting film &quot;Der ganze Körper fühlt sich leicht und möchte fliegen (The Whole Body Feels Light and Wants to Fly)&quot; (1969), made in collaboration with Christof Kohlhöfer, is a 35-minute piece in which, Polke scratches himself and uses a pendulum. He also reads from the esoteric 19th-century grimoires &quot;The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses&quot; (almost inaudibly as he keeps giggling all the time) and poses as the letter X, with parallel lines of white string connecting the legs of his trousers with the arms of his shirt.

===Commissioned works===

For the reopening of the Reichstag in Berlin in 1999, Polke created a series of large, three-dimensional lightboxes. Lighted from behind, images seen through the grooved surfaces of these lightboxes change as the viewer moves past them. Drawing on his early glass-painting training, Polke realized a series of stained-glass windows for the Grossmünster cathedral in Zürich between 2006 and 2009.

==Exhibitions==
Polke had his first one-person show at Galerie René Block, West Berlin, in 1966, and in 1970 he had his first solo exhibition at Galerie Michael Werner. His first solo exhibition in New York, of paintings made at least a decade earlier, was at the Holly Solomon Gallery in SoHo in 1982. Following a 1987 show at the Milwaukee Art Museum grouping Warhol, Beuys and Polke, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago mounted a solo show for Polke in 1991. Polke exhibited at three documenta and several Venice Biennial exhibitions.

By the latter years of his life, Polke&#x27;s artistic achievements were being recognised in large-scale exhibitions around the world, with solo shows at Tate Modern in 2003–2004, Tokyo&#x27;s Ueno Royal Museum in 2005 and the Getty Center in Los Angeles in 2007. In 2007, the &quot;Museum Moderner Kunst&quot; (MUMOK) held an exhibition of Polke&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Sigmar Polke: Retrospektive&quot;. Also in 2007, &quot;Axial Age&quot; (2005–2007), a monumental cycle of paintings, was shown for the first time at the 2007 Venice Biennale, with the wish explicitly expressed by the artist that the work should remain on display in Venice. Polke is scheduled to have a retrospective &quot;Alibis: Sigmar Polke 1963–2010&quot; shown at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, from 19 April to 3 August 2014, then travels to Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom and Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany.

==Art market==
Polke achieved earliest success with his paintings and drawings of consumer goods. His most recognizable works are from the mid-1960s and have performed the best at auction. A first record price for Polke&#x27;s work at auction was established when &quot;Strand (Beach)&quot; (1966) sold at Christie&#x27;s, in London, in 2007, for £2.7 million pounds (then $5.3 million). At a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in London in 2011, Polke&#x27;s &quot;City Painting II&quot; (1968) sold for $7.4 million, and his &quot;Jungle&quot; (1967) established a new record for the artist at $9.2 million. Meanwhile, &quot;Untitled (São Paolo Series)&quot; (1975, a series of ten large photographic images which Polke made for the São Paulo Biennial in 1975, sold at Christie&#x27;s London in February 2006 for £568,000 ($988,000). His &quot;Dschungel (Jungle)&quot; (1967), a romantic landscape for which he used magnified Benday dots from a newspaper in a style similar to Roy Lichtenstein, sold from the collection of Count Christian Duerckheim to an unidentified telephone bidder for $9.2 million at Sotheby&#x27;s at 29 May 2011; it sold again at Sotheby&#x27;s for $27.130.000, at 13 May 2015, the current record for one of his works.

==Legacy==
Through his numerous high-profile exhibitions, Polke exerted an international influence, affecting somewhat younger artists such as his compatriots Martin Kippenberger and Albert Oehlen, Lara Schnitger (Dutch-American artist), the Americans Richard Prince, Julian Schnabel and David Salle, and the Swiss duo Fischli &amp; Weiss. The artist John Baldessari described Polke as an &quot;artist&#x27;s artist&quot;. Today, Polke is often grouped with Gerhard Richter because both came of age and experimented in West Germany in the 1960s.

The Estate of Sigmar Polke has been established by his heirs—his widow, artist Augustina Baroness von Nagel, daughter Anna Polke, and son Georg Polke—to build up an archive in the artist&#x27;s Cologne studio. The Estate also administers the artist&#x27;s intellectual property rights. A Catalogue Raisonné of paintings, photographs and works on paper is currently being prepared by the Estate.

<doc id="1129819" wikidata="Q4892255" url="?curid=1129819" title="Berkshire County Council">
<text>Berkshire County Council, also known as the County Council of the Royal County of Berkshire, was the county council for Berkshire in England. It was created in 1889 and abolished in 1998. The council had responsibilities for education, social services, public transport, planning, emergency services and waste disposal.

On the abolition of the county council in 1998, the county&#x27;s six existing district councils also took on county council functions in their areas, making them unitary authorities. Berkshire is therefore now administered by the six councils of Bracknell Forest, Reading, Slough, West Berkshire, Windsor and Maidenhead, and Wokingham.

==History==

Elected county councils were created in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over many administrative functions that had previously been performed by unelected magistrates at the quarter sessions. The areas covered by the new county councils were called administrative counties. These differed from the historic counties by excluding any boroughs considered large enough to provide their own county-level functions, known as county boroughs, and by adjusting the boundaries such that any urban sanitary districts which straddled county boundaries were placed entirely in one administrative county. In Berkshire&#x27;s case, Reading was made a county borough, and the urban sanitary districts of Abingdon and Oxford had straddled the county boundary prior to 1889; Abingdon was placed entirely in Berkshire and Oxford was placed entirely in Oxfordshire.
The first elections were held in January 1889. After some provisional meetings, the council formally came into being on 1 April 1889. On that day it held its first official meeting at Reading Assizes Court, the county&#x27;s main courthouse, which had been completed in 1861 and also served as the meeting place for the quarter sessions which preceded the county council. The first chairman of the council was William George Mount, who was also the Conservative Member of Parliament for Newbury and the chairman of the quarter sessions.

In 1957 the council was given official permission from Elizabeth II to describe the county as the &quot;Royal County of Berkshire&quot;. After that it styled itself the &quot;County Council of the Royal County of Berkshire&quot; in official notices, although the name &quot;Berkshire County Council&quot; continued to be commonly used in the media.

===Non-metropolitan county===
Local government was reformed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The administrative county of Berkshire was abolished and a new non-metropolitan county of Berkshire created instead. There were some significant differences in the new county&#x27;s territory; it ceded a large area north of the Berkshire Downs hills in the north-west of the old county to Oxfordshire, but gained the area around Slough and Eton from Buckinghamshire. Reading was also brought under the authority of the county council for the first time. The lower tier of local government was reformed at the same time. Prior to 1974 it had comprised numerous boroughs, urban districts and rural districts. After 1974 the lower tier within the county as reformed comprised six non-metropolitan districts: Bracknell (renamed Bracknell Forest in 1988), Newbury, Reading, Slough, Windsor and Maidenhead, and Wokingham.

===Abolition===
The Local Government Act 1992 allowed for local government to be reorganised into single-tier authorities which perform both the functions of a district council and a county council. Such authorities subsequently became known as unitary authorities; in effect they have the same powers that the pre-1974 county boroughs did. The subsequent Banham Review sought to identify areas where such consolidation of local authorities could be applied, trying to reduce the number of tiers of local government. The Banham Review recommended abolishing Berkshire County Council and having the county administered by five unitary authorities, based on the pre-existing districts but merging Bracknell Forest and Windsor and Maidenhead into a single district. The government decided instead to leave the districts unchanged and make all six of them unitary authorities.

The way the change was implemented was to declare that there should be no county council for the non-metropolitan county of Berkshire, but that the six existing district councils would take on county council functions in their areas, making them unitary authorities. The county council&#x27;s last day was 31 March 1998; the district councils assumed their new responsibilities from 1 April 1998. Newbury District Council changed its name to West Berkshire Council to coincide with the change in its responsibilities.

===Aftermath===
One of the last chairmen of Berkshire County Council, Tony Wiseman, went on to found CRAG (a combination of the Readingstoke Action Group and CPRE) with a number of other former members of the council. CRAG successfully opposed Wokingham Borough Council&#x27;s plan for building houses between Reading and Basingstoke (to create a conurbation dubbed &#x27;Readingstoke&#x27;).

==Premises==

Berkshire County Council established its meeting place in the Assize Courts on The Forbury in Reading. As the council&#x27;s responsibilities grew, there was a need for more office space. In 1911 the council built itself a dedicated office building called Shire Hall immediately west of the Assizes Courts. Council meetings continued to be held at the Assizes Courts.

In 1981, the council left Shire Hall and moved to bigger premises at a new Shire Hall at Shinfield Park, on the southern outskirts of Reading, but just outside the borough boundaries in the neighbouring parish of Shinfield. The new building cost an estimated £27.5 million.

==Political control==
Elections were held to Berkshire County Council every three years (except during the two world wars) until 1974, changing to every four years after the 1974 reforms. The last full election took place in 1993.

Political control of the county council from the reforms of 1974 until its abolition in 1998 was as follows:
Most councillors stood as independent candidates prior to 1974, and party affiliations were not given on ballot papers until 1970. At the 1946 election, a year after the Labour victory in the 1945 general election, Labour won 17 seats. Despite this win, Labour were still a minority and party politics did not meaningfully come into play on the county council until after the 1974 reforms.

The council was then led by the Conservatives until 1992, when a Liberal Democrat and Labour coalition took control. The same coalition continued following the 1993 elections, but the coalition fractured in 1996. A Liberal Democrat minority administration then ran the council with informal support from the Conservatives until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1998.

==Leadership==
At first, the chairman was also the council&#x27;s political leader. After the 1974 reforms, the separate position of leader of the council was created and the chairman became a more ceremonial position.

===Chairmen===
Chairmanships were unlimited in duration or number of times (e.g. Sir George Robert Mowbray held the chairmanship twice, in 1944–1946 and 1960–1965).

In 1965, chairman Sir Louis Dickens changed the term of office to 3 years, to be changed one year before elections. In 1974, the Local Government Act changed the size of and nature of the council, hence the distinction between &#x27;old&#x27; and &#x27;new&#x27; County Councils.

==== Old Berkshire County Council (1889–1974) ====
The following table lists the chairmen of the old Berkshire County Council from 1889 to 1974:
Councillors were generally elected without a party affiliation, although two of the chairmen (William George Mount and Arthur Loyd) had been Conservative MPs prior to becoming chairman.

==== New Berkshire County Council (1974–1998) ====
The following table lists the chairmen of the new Berkshire County Council from 1974 to 1998:

===Leaders===
The leaders of the council from 1974 until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1998 were:

For the final couple of months of the council&#x27;s existence, Bob Mowatt&#x27;s deputy, Jeff Brooks, served as acting leader.

==Coat of arms==
The College of Arms granted Berkshire County Council a coat of arms on 18 July 1947, comprising a blue shield with two golden lions, derived from arms used by Norman kings and associated with Reading Abbey, with an embattled border representing the county&#x27;s castles, of which Windsor Castle is the most prominent. Above the shield was a crest of a stag and oak tree, based on the badge of the old Royal Berkshire Militia; there is a tradition that a banner with a stag and oak was carried by the men of Berkshire at the Battle of Agincourt. The stag and oak are assumed to represent the county&#x27;s forests and the popularity of hunting in the area amongst Saxon and Norman kings. A subsequent grant of 7 April 1961 supplemented the arms with supporters, being a red lion and white horse, and the colour of the stag was changed from white to gold. The red lion carries a Tudor rose as a symbol of the county&#x27;s royal connections. The white horse represents the Uffington White Horse, and carries a symbol known in heraldry as a &quot;pile&quot;, being a punning reference to the atomic pile at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.

The official blazon (heraldic description) of the coat of arms after the 1961 changes was:

After the 1974 changes to the county council&#x27;s area, two of the places referenced in the coat of arms, Uffington and Harwell, were both in Oxfordshire. A slightly modified version of the arms was therefore drawn up, replacing the white horse supporter with a black horse to represent the county&#x27;s associations with horse racing, notably at Ascot and Newbury. The black horse carries a six-pointed star representing the six districts of the post-1974 county and Slough&#x27;s role in the history of astronomy as the location of William and Caroline Herschel&#x27;s observatory in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

The blazon after the 1974 changes was:
The coat of arms belonged to the county council as an organisation rather than to the county itself. As such, no organisation has had the right to use the arms since the county council&#x27;s abolition in 1998. An attempt to have the arms transferred to the Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire was unsuccessful.

<doc id="1129820" wikidata="Q841174" url="?curid=1129820" title="Unofficial mottos of Poland">
<text>Poland has no official motto of the State, namely the one which is recognized as such by the Polish national law.

However, there are some common phrases which appear commonly on banners, flags and other symbols of the Polish State, or are considered commonly as the symbols of Poland.

*Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła (&quot;Poland is not yet lost&quot;) - the first line of the Polish national anthem.
*Bóg, Honor, Ojczyzna (&quot;God, Honor, Fatherland&quot;): the most common phrase found on Polish military standards.
*Za wolność naszą i Waszą (&quot;For our freedom and yours&quot;): Its history dates back to the times when Polish soldiers, exiled from the partitioned Poland, fought in the various independence movements throughout the world. 
*Żywią i bronią (ancient spelling: &quot;Żywią y bronią&quot;, &quot;They Feed and Defend&quot;) found on the military standards of the Kościuszko Insurrection and Bataliony Chłopskie, a motto of the Polish patriotic peasant movement and peasant (people&#x27;s) parties. 
* Pro Fide, Lege et Rege (&quot;For Faith, Law, and King&quot;): motto of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the 18th century and the Order of the White Eagle.
*Nic o nas, bez nas (&quot;Nothing about us, without us&quot;): Derives from the title of the Nihil novi Constitution of 1505, which established nobles&#x27; democracy in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In a modern context, it can also signify frustration at Poland&#x27;s fate being determined by foreign powers since the end of the 18th century. That is, the partitions and the Congress of Vienna, as well as, the Western Betrayal.
*Proletariusze wszystkich krajów, łączcie się! (&quot;Proletarians of all countries, unite!&quot;): The slogan of the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic.
*Żeby Polska była Polską (&quot;Let Poland be Poland&quot;): a song written in 1976 by Jan Pietrzak. The song was regarded as an expression of the struggle against communist rule in Poland and support for the &quot;Solidarity&quot; movement in the 1980s. English translation of the title song is often quoted in various speeches. Queen Elizabeth II herself delivered this statement &quot;in Polish&quot; in a speech cementing the re-establishment of Anglo-Polish friendship after the end of communism.
*Nie ma wolności bez Solidarności (&quot;There is no freedom without solidarity&quot;) - one of the mottos of the strikes of 1980 in Gdańsk and throughout Poland, subsequently taken over by the Solidarność (Solidarity) Independent Self-Governing Trade Union, and Solidarity social movement.

<doc id="1129823" wikidata="Q829643" url="?curid=1129823" title="Boundary Bay Airport">
<text>Boundary Bay Airport or Vancouver/Boundary Bay Airport is located beside Boundary Bay and east of Ladner in Delta, British Columbia, Canada, south southeast of Vancouver and close to the Point Roberts-Boundary Bay border crossing. The airport, which opened on July 11, 1983, serves mostly general aviation and includes facilities for aircraft maintenance, flight training and parking. In 2020 and 2021, Boundary Bay airport was ranked as the busiest airport in Canada by aircraft movements.

The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers are available on call to handle entry for aircraft carrying no more than 15 passengers.

==History==
=== World War II ===
The airfield was originally built in 1941 as Canadian Forces Station Ladner to teach Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Air Force recruits to be pilots in the Second World War. Operational squadrons operated out of Boundary Bay to provide air defence support against a potential Japanese invasion until early 1944. During the war, more than 6,000 students and personnel passed through the station. After the war, the base was no longer required, and the airfield was decommissioned by the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1946 after it served as a demobilization centre for troops returning from the war.

In the late 1940s, the site was transferred to the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals and became a signals intelligence station under the name Vancouver Wireless Station. The station was responsible for monitoring Soviet Union military communications at the height of the Cold War and played an important role for gathering communications from the Soviet Union and its fleet. A 40-hectare residential community was developed that included amenities such as a grocery store, social club, gymnasium and a sports field. Remnants of this community are still present today as the North 40 Park Reserve, an off-leash dog park and walking trail. 

When the armed forces was unified in 1968, the station&#x27;s name changed to CFS Ladner. The station eventually closed in 1971 due to the installation of nearby power lines in Ladner that made gathering signals difficult.

Following the closure of CFS Ladner, the site was used by the community of Ladner for picnics, public fairs and auto racing.

=== Reactivation as an Airport ===
By the mid-1970s, when it became obvious that Vancouver International Airport could no longer sustain both general aviation and heavy commercial traffic, Transport Canada explored several options and determined that it was most economical to reactivate Boundary Bay as a reliever field to handle general aviation aircraft. The airport underwent restoration, and on July 11, 1983, two of the three runways were reopened as Boundary Bay Airport. A new control tower was built to the west of the field and air traffic services were provided. The remaining runway was made available for driver training and other events, until it became hangarage options for privately owned aircraft. 

The field was initially owned and operated by Transport Canada until it was sold to the City of Delta for a nominal fee of $1. Operations and development of the airport was contracted out to a third-party, but the facilities degraded over time until the municipal government vacated its contract with the management company. 

In December 2004, the City of Delta contracted Alpha Aviation to develop the airport. Boundary Bay Airport was acquired by Alpha Aviation under a lease with the City of Delta. Under the terms of the lease, driver training, autocross and drag racing were removed from the airport, allowing Alpha Aviation to focus on runway, facility and land-use improvements. In April 2008, Alpha Aviation established a fixed-base operation (FBO) and Alpha Executive Air began operating regularly scheduled flights twice daily between Boundary Bay Airport and Victoria International Airport on Vancouver Island, as well as chartered aircraft services. As of 2010, Alpha Executive Air ceased operations but the FBO is open serving business, corporate, and general aviation customers.

Investment by Alpha Aviation and significant grants from the British Columbia government enabled an extension of runway 07/25, improving usability of the runway for corporate jets, as well as other infrastructure improvements. The upgrades enables Boundary Bay Airport as an alternative landing destination to Vancouver International Airport. 

Under Alpha Aviation, significant investments have been made to improve airport facilities and infrastructure, such as runway extensions to all runways, installation of PAPI lighting, construction of new fuel facilities, and the construction of multiple hangars including a maintenance hangar. The old maintenance hangar, the only remaining building from the war has been rehabilitated and declared a heritage site. In February 2010, and in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Alpha Aviation opened a new terminal building. This facility serves general aviation and private aircraft, with FBO services run by Alpha Aviation. The new facility will allow Boundary Bay Airport to accommodate regional airlines.

In 2011, the Corporation of Delta extended Alpha Aviation&#x27;s lease until 2099.


==Airlines and destinations==
Until early 2023, Air West Charters and Oceanside Air provided on-demand air charter to destinations throughout British Columbia. Since then, there has been no hub-and-spoke operator based out of Boundary Bay. BC Air does provide services, but as a point-to-point operator. 

==Fixed-base operator==
As of 2011, only one FBO operates at Boundary Bay Airport:
* Boundary Bay Air Services

==Flight training==
Five flight schools are based at the airport:
* International Flight Centre
* Insignia College
* Pacific Flying Club
* Pacific Professional Flight Centre
* Sea Land Air

==Fuel services==
Fuel services at Boundary Bay Airport are run by Alpha Aviation. Fuels available:
*Avgas 100LL
*Jet A-1

Fuel system icing inhibitor and oil are also available.

<text>The Battle of Saipan was an amphibious assault launched by the United States against the Empire of Japan during the Pacific campaign of World War II between 15 June and 9 July 1944. The initial invasion triggered the Battle of the Philippine Sea, which effectively destroyed Japanese carrier-based airpower, and the battle resulted in the American capture of the island. Its occupation put the major cities of the Japanese home islands within the range of B-29 bombers, making them vulnerable to strategic bombing by the United States Army Air Forces. It also precipitated the resignation of Hideki Tōjō, the prime minister of Japan.

Saipan was the first objective in Operation Forager, the campaign to occupy the Mariana Islands that got underway at the same time the Allies were invading France in Operation Overlord. After a two-day naval bombardment, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and the Army&#x27;s 27th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Holland Smith, landed on the island and defeated the 43rd Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saitō. Organized resistance ended when at least 3,000 Japanese soldiers died in a mass &quot;gyokusai&quot; attack, and afterward about 1,000 civilians committed suicide.

The capture of Saipan pierced the Japanese inner defense perimeter, and forced the Japanese government to inform its citizens for the first time that the war was not going well. The battle claimed more than 46,000 military casualties and at least 8,000 civilian deaths. The high percentage of casualties suffered during the battle influenced American planning for future assaults, including the projected invasion of Japan.

==Background==
===American strategic objectives===

Up to early 1944, Allied operations against the Japanese military in the Pacific were focused on securing the lines of communication between Australia and the United States. These operations had recaptured the Solomon Islands, eastern New Guinea, western New Britain, the Admiralty Islands, and the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.

To defeat Japan, Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, sought to execute War Plan Orange, which the Naval War College had been developing for four decades in the event of a war. The plan envisioned an offensive through the Central Pacific that originated from Hawaii, island-hopped through Micronesia and the Philippines, forced a decisive battle with the Japanese Navy, and brought about an economic collapse of Japan.

As early as the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, King presented the case to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for an amphibious offensive in the Central Pacific – including the Marshall Islands and Truk – that would capture the Mariana Islands. He stated that the occupation of the Marianas – specifically Saipan, Tinian and Guam – would cut the sea and air route from the Japanese home islands to the western Pacific, but the Combined Chiefs of Staff made no commitment at the time. General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area, objected to King&#x27;s proposed Central Pacific offensive. He argued that it would be costly and time-consuming and would pull resources away from his drive in the Southwest Pacific toward the Philippines.

At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, King continued to advocate for including the Marianas in a Central Pacific offensive. He suggested that the strategic importance of the Marianas could draw the main Japanese fleet out for a major naval battle. King&#x27;s advocacy gained support from General Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Forces, who wanted to use the newly developed B-29 bomber.
The Marianas could provide secure airfields to sustain a strategic bombing offensive as the islands put much of Japan&#x27;s population centers and industrial areas within the B-29&#x27;s mile combat radius. At the Cairo Conference in November 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff supported both MacArthur&#x27;s offensive in the Southwest Pacific and King&#x27;s in the Central Pacific, adding the Marianas as an objective for the Central Pacific offensive and setting 1 October 1944 as the date for their invasion.

Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas led the Central Pacific offensive. In January–February 1944, the Marshall Islands were quickly captured and a massive American carrier-based air attack on Truk demonstrated that it could be neutralized and bypassed. On 12 March 1944, the Joint Chiefs of Staff moved the date of the invasion up to 15 June with the goal of creating airfields for B-29s and developing secondary naval bases. Nimitz updated the plans for the Central Pacific offense, codenamed Granite II, and set the invasion of the Marianas, codenamed Forager, as its initial objective. Saipan would be the first assault.

===Japanese strategic plan===
The Japanese Imperial War Council established the &quot;&quot;, &quot;Zettai Kokubōken&quot;) in September 1943, which was bounded by the Kuril Islands, Bonin Islands, the Marianas, Western New Guinea, Malaya, and Burma. This line was to be held at all costs if Japan was to win the war. The Marianas were considered particularly important to protect as their capture would put Japan within bombing range of the B-29 bomber and allow the Americans to interdict the supply routes between the Japanese home islands and the western Pacific.

The Imperial Japanese Navy planned to hold the defense line by defeating the United States fleet in a single decisive battle, after which, the Americans were expected to negotiate for peace. The Japanese Submarine Fleet (6th Fleet), commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi whose headquarters was on Saipan, would screen the line. Any American attempt to breach this line was to serve as the trigger to start the battle. The defense forces in the attacked area would attempt to hold their positions while the Japanese Combined Fleet struck the Americans, sinking their carriers with land-based aircraft and finishing the fleet off with surface ships. As part of this plan the Japanese could deploy over 500 land-based planes – 147 of them immediately in the Marianas – that made up the 1st Air Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Kakuji Kakuta whose headquarters was on Tinian.

==History and geography==

Saipan and the other Mariana Islands were claimed as Spanish possessions by the conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565. After Spain&#x27;s defeat in the Spanish-American War, Saipan was sold to Germany in 1899. The island was occupied by the Japanese in 1914 during World War I, who made it the administrative center for the Mariana Islands – Saipan, Tinian and Rota – that were part of Japan&#x27;s South Seas Mandate.

Saipan has a tropical marine climate with a mean annual temperature of in the lowlands and in the highlands. Though the island has a mean rainfall between and inches per year, the rainy season does not begin until July.
Unlike the small, flat coral atolls of the Gilberts and Marshalls,
Saipan is a volcanic island with diverse terrain well suited for defense.
It is approximately ,
and has a volcanic core surrounded by limestone. In the center of the island is Mount Tapotchau, which rises to . From the mountain, a high ridge ran northward about to Mount Marpi. This area was filled with caves and ravines concealed by forest and brush, and the mountainous terrain would force tanks to stay on the island&#x27;s few roads, which were poorly constructed.

The southern half of the island was where the principal airfield of the Marianas, Aslito Field, was located. It served as a repair stop and transit hub for Japanese aircraft headed toward other parts of the Pacific.
This half of the island was flatter but covered with sugar cane fields because the island&#x27;s economy became focused on sugar production after the Japanese government had taken over Saipan from Germany in 1914. Seventy percent of Saipan&#x27;s acreage was dedicated to sugar cane. It was so plentiful that a narrow-gauge railway was built around the perimeter of the island to facilitate its transportation. These cane fields were an obstacle to attackers: they were difficult to maneuver in and provided concealment for the defenders.

Saipan was the first island during the Pacific War where the United States forces encountered a substantial Japanese civilian population, and the first where U. S. Marines fought around urban areas. Approximately 26,000 to 28,000 civilians lived on the island, primarily serving the sugar industry. The majority of them were Japanese subjects, most of whom were from Okinawa and Korea; a minority were Chamorro people. The largest towns on the island were the administrative center of Garapan, which had a population of 10,000, Charan Kanoa, and Tanapag. They were on the western coast of the island, which was where the best landing beaches for an invasion were.

==Opposing forces==
===American invasion force===

Nimitz, the commander of the Pacific Fleet, assigned Admiral Raymond Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet, to oversee the operation. Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner, Commander, Joint Amphibious Forces (Task Force 51) oversaw the overall organization of the amphibious landings of the Mariana Islands; he also oversaw the tactical command of the landing on Saipan as Commander, Northern Attack Force (TF 52). Once the amphibious landings were completed, Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith, Commanding General, Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56), would oversee the ground forces for all of Forager; he would also oversee the ground combat on Saipan as Commander, Northern Troops and Landing Force.

The Northern Troops and Landing Force was built around the V Amphibious Corps, which consisted of the 2nd Marine Division commanded by Major General Thomas E. Watson and 4th Marine Division commanded by Major General Harry Schmidt.
The 27th Infantry Division commanded by Major General Ralph C. Smith was held as the Expeditionary Troops reserve for use anywhere in the Marianas. Over 60,000 troops were assigned to the assault. Approximately 22,000 were in each Marine division and 16,500 in the 27th Infantry Division.
The invasion fleet, consisting of over 500 ships and 300,000 men, got underway days before the Allied forces in Europe invaded France in Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944. It was launched from Hawaii, briefly stopping at Eniwetok and Kwajalein before heading for Saipan. The Marine divisions left Pearl Harbor on 19–31 May and rendezvoused at Eniwetok on 7–8 June; the 27th Infantry Division left Pearl Harbor on 25 May and arrived at Kwajalein on 9 June. The fifteen aircraft carriers of the Fast Carrier Task Force (Task Force 58) commanded by Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, which would provide support for the invasion, left Majuro for Saipan on 6 June.
The invasion force included 150 tanks, over 100 of which were M4 Sherman tanks. The M4 Sherman tank was superior to the medium tank used by the Japanese, the Type 97. It was primarily used to support infantry and was considered one of the most effective weapons for destroying enemy emplacements. Flame throwers were extensively used. Smith had seen the need for motorized flamethrowers and had requested that the Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in Hawaii install them in M3 Stuart tanks. Seabees with the CWS had 24 tanks, nicknamed &quot;Satans&quot;, converted to flamethrowing in time for the invasion. They were very effective for destroying pillboxes, cave defenses, buildings, canefields, and brush.

===Japanese defense preparations===
American intelligence had estimated that there would be between 15,000 and 18,000 Japanese troops on Saipan at the time of the invasion. In actuality, there were double that number. Nearly 32,000 Japanese military personnel were on the island, including 6,000 naval troops. The two major army units defending the island were the 43rd Division commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saitō and the 47th Independent Mixed Brigade commanded by Colonel Yoshira Oka. Both units were assigned to the Thirty-First Army under the overall command of Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata.

The Japanese hurriedly reinforced the island before the invasion, but many of the troop transports were sunk by U.S. submarines. For example, five of the seven ships transporting the 43rd Division were sunk. Most of the troops were saved, but the majority of their equipment–including hats and shoes–was lost, reducing their effectiveness. Many soldiers were the stranded survivors of sunken ships headed to other islands. There were about 80 tanks on the island, substantially more than the Americans had encountered in previous battles with the Japanese.

The Japanese defenses were set up to defeat an invading force on Saipan&#x27;s beaches, where the invading troops were most vulnerable. These defenses focused on the most likely invasion locations, the western beaches south of Garapan. This made the defenses weak. If an invading force broke through the beach defenses, there was no organized fallback position: the Japanese troops would have to rely on Saipan&#x27;s rough terrain, especially its caves, for protection. The original plans called for a defense in depth that fortified the entire island if time allowed, but the Japanese were unable to complete their defenses by the time of the invasion. Much of the building material sent to Saipan, such as concrete and steel, had been sunk in transit by American submarines, and the timing of the invasion surprised the Japanese, who thought they had until November to complete their defense. As of June, many fortifications remained incomplete, available building materials were left unused, and many artillery guns were not properly deployed.

Japanese leadership on the island suffered from poor command coordination. Although Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, Commander of the Central Pacific Area Fleet, had nominal oversight of the defenses in the Central Pacific, Obata refused to subordinate his army command to a naval officer. Because Obata was on Guam and away from his Saipan headquarters when the invasion started, command of Saipan&#x27;s army units fell to Saitō, who was the senior army officer on the island. Obata&#x27;s chief of staff, Major General Keiji Igeta, maintained a separate headquarters that was often out of touch with Saitō.

==Battle==
===11–14 June: Preparatory attacks===

On 11 June, over 200 F6F Hellcats from the Fast Carrier Task Force launched a surprise attack on Japanese airfields in Saipan and Tinian, putting approximately 130 Japanese aircraft out of operation at the cost of 11 American aircraft.
The attack destroyed most of the 1st Air Fleet&#x27;s land-based planes that had been deployed to defend the Marianas, and gave the Americans air superiority over Saipan. Planes from the task force continued their attacks until 14 June, harassing fields, bombing military targets, and burning cane fields on the southern half of Saipan. By the end of the week, the 1st Air Fleet had been reduced to about 100 aircraft.

On 13 June, seven fast battleships and 11 destroyers under Vice Admiral Willis Lee began the naval bombardment of Saipan. Most of these battleships&#x27; crews had not been trained in shore bombardment and the ships fired from more than to avoid potential minefields. The bombardment damaged much of Garapan and Charan Kanoa, but it was relatively ineffective at destroying the island&#x27;s defenses. The following day, seven older battleships, 11 cruisers, and 26 destroyers commanded by Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf continued the shelling. These crews were trained in shore bombardment, and moved closer to shore because the sea was found to be free of mines. This bombardment eliminated many emplaced anti-aircraft positions, but it too failed to destroy most of the beach defenses.

===15 June: D-Day===

15 June was D-Day for the amphibious landing, which began around 08:40. Naval and aerial bombardments in preparation for the landings began earlier in the morning,
disrupting the Japanese communications network.
The guns of the warships would provide continuous supporting fire throughout the day.

The V Amphibious Corps landed on the southwest beaches of Saipan. The 2nd Marine Division landed on two beaches, named Red and Green, of Charan Kanoa, and the 4th Marine Division landed on the beaches named Blue and Yellow south of the town. Approximately 700 amphibious vehicles participated in the assault, including 393 amphibious tractors (LVTs) and 140 amphibious tanks. Within 20 minutes, there were around 8,000 men on the beaches.

The beaches were fortified by trenches and a few pillboxes, but the landings were mainly contested by constant and intensive fire by Japanese artillery, mortars, and machine guns. The Japanese had concentrated at least 50 large artillery pieces on the high ground—including at least 24 105-mm howitzers and 30 75-mm field pieces—around the invasion beaches. Many were deployed on reverse slopes, and pennants had been placed on the beach for accurate ranging. The Americans suffered over 2,000 casualties, the majority were due to the artillery and mortar fire. Additionally, 164 amphibious tractors and amphibious tanks, about 40% of those engaged during the day, had been destroyed or damaged.
By the end of the day, the Marines managed to establish a bridgehead about along the beach and inland, and had unloaded artillery and tanks.
The bridgehead was only about two-thirds the size of the planned objective, the two Marine divisions were separated by a wide gap just north of Charan Kanoa,
and the Japanese artillery remained intact on the high ground surrounding the beach.

When darkness fell, Saito launched a series of night attacks to push the Americans back into the sea. The Japanese launched repeated counterattacks during the night and the early hours of the following morning, mostly by poorly coordinated small units. All the attacks were repulsed, partly by the firepower provided by the tanks and artillery that had been unloaded during the day as well as by American warships that illuminated the combat areas with star shells.

===16–20 June: Southern Saipan===

On 16 June, Holland Smith committed his reserves to reinforce the beachhead, ordering two of the three regiments of the 27th Infantry Division—the 165th and the 105th—to land. He proposed to indefinitely postpone the 18 June invasion of Guam. The two Marine divisions on Saipan spent most of the day consolidating the beachhead. The 2nd Marine Division began to close the gap between the two divisions north of Charan Kanoa, and the 4th Marine Division cleared the area around Aginan point on the southwest of the Island.

During the night, Saitō launched a tank assault on the flank of the beachhead just north of Charan Kanoa with approximately 35 Type 97 medium tanks and Type 95 light tanks and about 1,000 soldiers. The attack was poorly coordinated. Nagumo&#x27;s naval troops, who were supposed to be part of the attack, did not cooperate. The attack was broken up by bazookas, 37 mm anti-tank guns, M4 Sherman tanks, and self-propelled 75 mm howitzers.
Around 31 Japanese tanks were destroyed.
In the following days, the 2nd Marine Division on the northern half of the bridgehead cleared the area around Lake Susupe and reached the objectives for the first day of the invasion, and slowly moved north toward Garapan and Mount Tapotchou. In the southern half of the bridgehead, the 4th Marine Division began their advance on Aslito Field. On 18 June, the two regiments of the 27th Infantry Division, which was now fighting as a unit, captured the field as the Japanese withdrew to Nafutan Point in the southeast of the island. The 4th Marine Division had reached the island&#x27;s eastern coast, cutting off the Japanese troops at Nafutan Point from the north. During this time, Saitō was falsely rumored to have been killed. Igeta erroneously reported Saitō&#x27;s death to Tokyo, though he corrected the report later.

Holland Smith ordered the 27th Infantry Division to quickly capture Nafutan Point but it was unable to do so. Smith had estimated that there were no more than 300 Japanese soldiers in the area, but there were more than 1,000 defending the rough terrain. The battle for the point would continue for over a week.

By 19 June, the Japanese forces on the island had been reduced by about half.
Saitō began withdrawing his troops to a new defensive line in the center of the island. By this time, the Americans had suffered over 6,000 casualties. The Marine divisions headed north toward the new Japanese defenses, and Holland Smith called for the final reserve of the Expeditionary Forces, ordering the last regiment of the 27th infantry Division, the 106th, to land on Saipan on 20 June.

===Battle of Philippine Sea===
Once Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, was certain that Saipan was the target of an invasion, he initiated his response.
Less than a half hour after the start of the amphibious invasion, he announced the implementation of Operation &quot;A-Go&quot;, the Japanese Navy&#x27;s current plan to destroy the American fleet. He then sent a message to the entire fleet that repeated Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō&#x27;s speech before Japan&#x27;s decisive naval battle against Russia at Tsushima in 1905, which in turn echoed Horatio Nelson&#x27;s signal at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805: &quot;The fate of the Empire rests upon this single battle. Every man is expected to do his utmost.&quot;

Originally, the Japanese Navy sought to have the battle take place in the Palaus or Western Carolines, and MacArthur&#x27;s invasion of Biak had led them to believe that they could lure the American fleet there. After the preinvasion bombardment of Saipan, Toyoda guessed Saipan was the target and ordered Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki who commanded the super battleships &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; to rendezvous with Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, commander of the 1st Mobile Fleet and to rendezvous in the Philippine Sea to attack the American fleet around Saipan. The Japanese fleet, which had 9 aircraft carriers, 5 battleships, and nearly 500 airplanes was outnumbered by the American fleet, which had 16 aircraft carriers, 7 battleships, and almost 1,000 airplanes.
The Japanese thought they had some advantages: the longer range of the Japanese planes would allow them the opportunity to strike the Americans without fear of immediate retaliation, the availability of airbases on the Marianas would give the carrier planes a place to land and quickly rearm for further strikes, and Kakuta was incorrectly assumed to have 500 additional land-based planes available.

The American transports continued to unload supplies and reinforcements throughout 17 June. The following day, the transports sailed east toward safety while the warships set off for battle with the Japanese fleet. On 19–20 June, the fleets fought an aircraft carrier battle. The Japanese struck first, launching four large air attacks on the American fleet. The Japanese aviators were inexperienced and outnumbered: very few of the anticipated land-based planes were available, and those that were had little effect.

The Japanese lost almost 500 planes and almost all their aviators; their carrier forces were left with only 35 operable aircraft. The Americans lost about 130 planes and 76 aviators. An American counterstrike sank a Japanese carrier, and American submarines sank two others, including Ozawa&#x27;s flagship &quot;Taihō&quot;. The Japanese submarine fleet failed to play a significant role as well. The invasion forced Takagi to move his headquarters from Garapan into the mountains of Saipan, making his command ineffective. Out of 25 submarines deployed for the battle, 17 were sunk. Though defenders on the island didn&#x27;t know it at the time, the defeat of the Japanese fleet ensured that they would not be reinforced, resupplied or receive further military support.
The Japanese command was determined to hold the island at all costs, but it would be fighting a losing battle of attrition.

===21–24 June: Central Saipan, initial attack===

Saitō&#x27;s new defense line stretched from Garapan on the west coast to the southern slopes of Mount Tapatchou across to Magicienne Bay on the east coast. It held most of the island&#x27;s high ground, which allowed the Japanese to observe American movements, and the rough terrain was filled with caves concealed by brush.

The American forces prepared for a frontal assault on Saitō&#x27;s line using all three divisions. The attack began on 22 June. The 2nd Marine Division which was on the western coast moved toward Garapan and Mount Tapatchou; the 4th Marine Division advanced along the eastern coast, which created gaps in the lines in the hilly ground between the two divisions. That evening, the 27th Infantry Division, less the regiment left to reduce Nafutan point, was ordered to move up into the difficult terrain between the two Marine divisions.

The next day, the Marine divisions on the flanks made progress, but the 27th Infantry Division, which started its attack late, stalled in its assault on a valley surrounding a low lying ridge that was defended by about 4,000 Japanese soldiers. The battle around these features, which American soldiers nicknamed the &quot;Death Valley&quot; and &quot;Purple Heart Ridge&quot;, began to bend the line of the American advance into a horseshoe, creating gaps in the Marine divisions flanks and forcing them to halt.

Frustrated by what he saw as lack of progress by the 27th Division, Holland Smith relieved its commander, Major General Ralph Smith, and temporarily replaced him with another Army officer, Major General Sanderford Jarman. The debate over the appropriateness of Holland&#x27;s Smith action–a Marine general dismissing an Army general–immediately created an inter-service controversy. Despite the replacement of the 27th Infantry Division&#x27;s commander, it would take six more days for the valley to be captured.

===25–30 June: Central Saipan, breakthrough===
====American firepower====

The United States forces had built up substantial firepower to continue their northward drive. On 22 June, P-47s from the Seventh Air Force landed on Aslito Field and immediately began launching ground assault missions. On the same day, the XXIV Corps Artillery commanded by Brigadier General Arthur M. Harper moved 24 155 mm field guns and 24 155 mm howitzers into place to fire on Japanese positions.
The Americans also used truck-launched rockets for saturation barrages. Spotters flying in L-4 Grasshoppers helped direct ground artillery, and Navajo code talkers relayed information about Japanese troop movements. In the hills, soldiers relied on personal flamethrowers, particularly in locations where the motorized flamethrowers could not reach. They gradually developed tactics for effectively reducing caves, using a combination of flamethrowers and demolition charges to clear them, or sometimes using demolitions to seal them off.

By 24 June, the American warships that had returned from the Battle of Philippine Sea were once more available to provide fire support.
Ship fire was particularly feared by the Japanese because it could strike from almost any direction. Saitō singled out naval gunfire undermining the Japanese&#x27; ability to fight successfully against the Americans. 
The ships were also well supplied with star shells, providing illumination that disrupted Japanese night movements and counterattacks. This naval support was facilitated by joint assault signal companies that directed both naval and aerial firepower to where it was needed by the ground forces.

====American advance and Japanese break out at Nafutan Point====

On 25 June, the 27th Infantry Division was not able to make much headway in their fight for Death Valley, but the 2nd Marine Division to the west gained control of Mount Tapotchau, the key artillery observation posts in Central Saipan. On the east coast, the 4th Marine Division quickly occupied most of the Kagman peninsula, meeting little organized resistance because the Japanese had evacuated the peninsula. Between 26 June and 30 June, the 2nd Marine Division and the 27th Infantry Division had made little progress. The second Marines remained south of Garapan and were slowly fighting their way north of Mount Tapotchau. The 4th Marine Division was able to advance up the eastern coast to a line just north of the village of Hashigoru.

About 500 Japanese soldiers broke out of Nafutan point on the night of 26 June. They headed toward Aslito Field, destroying one P-47 and damaging two others.
They then ran into a unit of Marines who were in reserve and a unit of Marine artillery. Almost all the Japanese soldiers were killed in the ensuing firefight. The next day, the elements of the 27th Infantry Division that had been fighting at the point moved in to occupy the area, no survivors were found.

Igeta&#x27;s 31st Army Headquarters sent a telegram from the island on 27 June, stating the Japanese would not be able to hold due to the American preponderance in artillery, sea and air power, as well of a lack of equipment and supplies, including food and water. The lack of water was particularly acute in the limestone caves the Japanese soldiers used for defense. Igeta reported that some soldiers hadn&#x27;t had water for three days and were surviving on snails and tree leaves. Japanese communications were so disrupted that at one point during the week, Igeta could only account for 950 of the Japanese soldiers.

On June 28, Army Major General George Griner, who had been sent for from Hawaii, took over from command of the 27th Infantry Division. Jarman, whose command had been temporary, returned to his assigned role as garrison commander of the island. On 30 June, the 27th Infantry Division captured Death Valley and Purple Heart Ridge, and advanced far enough to reestablish contact with the two Marine divisions on their flanks. Saitō&#x27;s main line of defense in Central Saipan had been breached; and the Japanese began their retreat north to their final defensive line. To date, American casualties were about 11,000.

===1–6 July: Pursuit into northern Saipan===

Saitō intended to form a new line in northern Saipan that would be anchored on Tanapag on the west, running southeast to a village called Tarahoho, and through to the east coast. He wasn&#x27;t able to. His army&#x27;s cohesion was disintegrating: Some of the remaining forces retreated north, others holed up in whatever caves they could find, others put up disorganized resistance where they were. During 2–4 July, the 2nd Marine Division took the ruins of Garapan and its harbor. The 4th Marine Division quickly moved north on the west coast in the face of light resistance.
As Saitō&#x27;s attempt to form the defense line collapsed, he eventually moved his final headquarters near Makunsha village on the west coast north of Tanapag.

On 4 July, the 27th Infantry Division and 4th Marine Division headed northwest. The 27th division reached the west coast at Flores Point, south of Tanapag, cutting off any Japanese retreating from Garapan.
The 2nd Marine Division no longer faced organized resistance, and went into reserve. The 27th Infantry Division was to move up the east coast toward Tanapag, and the 4th Marine Division would advance northwest. On 5 July, the 27th Infantry Division encountered strong resistance in a narrow canyon on the east coast north of Tanapag that they dubbed &quot;Harikari Gulch&quot;, which expanded into a two-day battle.
The 4th Marine Division continued to make rapid progress north during 4–5 July,
and on 6 July, Holland Smith ordered them to head toward the eastern coast near Makunsha to cut off the Japanese forces fighting the 27th Infantry Division, then the Marines would complete the occupation of the rest of northern Saipan on their own.
In the evening, the Marines had taken Mount Petosukara, one of the last mountains before reaching the northern tip of the island, but the units that turned toward Makunsha encountered too much resistance to reach the eastern coast.

Saitō realized he could not create a final defensive line.
His headquarters, which had been under constant artillery attack for days, was now in the range of American machine guns. What was left of his command was trapped in a northern corner of the island, almost out of food and water, and slowly being destroyed by overwhelming American firepower. On 6 July, Saitō decided the situation was hopeless and sent out orders for the remainder of his forces to perform &quot;gyokusai&quot;, one final suicide attack to destroy as many of the enemy as possible. He set the attack for the following day to give the troops a chance to concentrate what was left of his forces and put his divisional chief of staff, Colonel Takuji Suzuki, in charge. That night, Saitō ate a last meal and committed &quot;seppuku&quot;, and Nagumo killed himself around the same time, Takagi stated he would die attacking the enemy.

===7–9 July: Gyokusai attack and battle&#x27;s end===
At least 3,000 Japanese combatants participated in the &quot;gyokusai&quot; attack. They assembled near Makunsha. The force included naval personnel, support troops, civilians, and the walking wounded. It included three tanks, supporting mortars, and machine guns, but some troops were only armed with sticks with bayonets, knives, or grenades tied to poles. It would be the largest &quot;gyokusai&quot; attack of the Pacific War.

At around 04:00, Suzuki&#x27;s force advanced south along the western coastal area, called the Tanapag plain,
toward where his reconnaissance patrols had found a weak spot in the American line near Tanapag village: two battalions of the 105 Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division were isolated from the other American forces. The main force struck the two battalions at about 04:45, overrunning both. The two battalions suffered about 900 casualties, which was 80% of their effective force. The charge continued toward Tanapag village, overrunning two batteries of Marine artillery, but was halted in the late morning by a hastily formed American line around the village. The fighting continued throughout the day, as American soldiers struggled against scattered elements of the &quot;gyokusai&quot; attack and recaptured lost ground.

On 8 July, most of the 27th Infantry Division, which had suffered high losses in the &quot;gyokusai&quot; attack, was placed into reserve. The 2nd Marine Division advanced up the Tanapag plain, looking for Japanese stragglers. The 4th Marine Division reached the Western coast north of Makunsha and headed toward Marpi point, near the island&#x27;s northern-most tip. As they advanced, they saw hundreds of Japanese civilians die on inland and coastal cliffs. Some threw themselves off, others were thrown or pushed off. By the evening of 9 July, the 4th Marine Division had reached the northern end of the Island and Turner declared the island secure. On the second day of the battle, he had estimated that Saipan would be captured in a week; it had taken 24 days. On 11 July, the Americans found General Saitō&#x27;s body. He was buried on 13 July with full military honors in a coffin draped with the Japanese flag.

Though the island was declared secured, the fighting and suicides would continue. Clearing the hundreds of scattered Japanese soldiers hiding in caves would take many more months, though the responsibilities were handed over to the Army Garrison Force. One group of about 50 Japanese men–soldiers and civilians–was led by Captain Sakae Ōba, who survived the last &quot;gyokusai&quot; charge. His group evaded capture and conducted guerrilla-style attacks, raiding American camps for supplies. Oba&#x27;s resistance earned him the nickname &quot;the Fox&quot;. His men held out for approximately 16 months before surrendering on 1 December 1945, three months after the official surrender of Japan.

==Casualties==

Almost the entire Japanese garrison–approximately 30,000 military personnel–were killed in the battle. Eventually 1,700, about half of whom were Korean workers, were taken prisoner. American forces suffered about 16,500 casualties –3,100 killed and 13,000 wounded– out of 71,000 who were part of the assault force. The casualty rate was over 20%, which was comparable to Tarawa. It was the Americans&#x27; most deadly battle in the Pacific up to that time.

Approximately 40% of the civilians on Saipan were killed. Around 14,000 survived and were interned, but an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 died during the fighting or shortly afterwards. Many civilians died from the bombing, shelling and cross-fire. Others died because they hid in caves and shelters that were indistinguishable from Japanese combat positions, which the Marines typically destroyed with explosives, grenades and flamethrowers. Though many civilians were able to surrender early in the battle, surrender became more difficult as the battle moved into the northern mountains. Obscuring terrain made it hard to distinguish combatants and surrendering civilians, who risked being killed by both sides. Many refused to surrender because they believed rumors that the Japanese fleet was coming to rescue them. Others refused because of the fear spread by Japanese propaganda that Americans would rape, torture and kill them; others were coerced. Around 1,000 civilians committed suicide during the final days of the battle, some after 9 July when the island had been declared secure. Many died by throwing themselves off cliffs at places that would become known as &quot;Suicide Cliff&quot; and &quot;Banzai Cliff&quot;.

==Logistics==

The American forces brought their supplies with the invasion fleet, carrying over one ton of supplies per soldier: 32 days of rations, 30 days of medical supplies, 20 days of maintenance supplies, seven days of ammunition for ground weapons, and ten days of anti-aircraft ammunition. Mobile reserves and an ammunition resupply train, as well as regular resupply shipments came from depots at Eniwetok, which was from Saipan.

During the early days of the invasion, LVTs dumped boxes of rations, water and ammunition on the beaches. Heavy swells on the first days forced many of the supplies to be loaded on only one beach, and LVTs were required to get over reefs that restricted access. Constant Japanese mortar and artillery fire interfered with organizing these supplies for the first three days. Unloading became haphazard, and some units had difficulty finding their equipment. The withdrawal of the transports for five days during the Battle of Philippine Sea also slowed down the delivery of supplies.

The 27th Infantry Division particularly suffered from this initial disorganization. No plans had been made for its landing and it did not have an assigned unloading area. Its equipment was mixed up with the Marine divisions and its artillery ammunition was misplaced. Because it arrived on Saipan after the Marine divisions, the 27th Infantry Division had less time to unload its supplies before the transports temporarily headed east on 18 June. Initially, the division only had enough infantry ammunition for four days. Food and artillery ammunition had to be borrowed from the Marines, and water had to be supplemented from cisterns captured at Aslito Field.

Later in the campaign, mortar ammunition ran low as planners had underestimated how frequently they would be used, and there were shortages of motorized transportation, which was used for getting supplies from the beach to the frontline. Naval ships ran low on star shells due to their high demand, and their use had to be rationed. Despite these issues, the overall supply situation during the battle was good: the Americans had an abundance of materiel.

The Japanese troops had no chance of reinforcement. From January to June, the Japanese had tried to ship men and supplies to Saipan, but many ships around the island were torpedoed by American submarines. The Japanese government reported that one ship out of three sent to the Marianas were sunk and another was damaged. Though many of the men survived, almost all the materiel was lost. For example, on 25 May two freighters from Saipan to Palau were torpedoed, destroying 2,956 tons of food, 5,300 cans of aviation fuel, 2,500 cubic meters of ammunition, and 500 tons of cement.

At the beginning of the battle, the Americans had six times the tanks, five times the artillery, three times as many small arms, and two times as many machine guns available as the Japanese. The Americans also had much more ammunition. The U. S. Navy fired 11,000 tons of shells during the battle, including over 14,000 rounds of 5-inch ammunition. Unlike the Americans, who could replenish their supplies, the Japanese could not. They had to fight with what was available when the invasion started, and when it ran out they were expected to die honorably, resisting until the end.

== Aftermath ==
The invasion of Saipan and the invasion of France in Operation Overlord demonstrated the dominance of American industrial power. Both were massive amphibious invasions–the two largest up to that time–and they were launched almost simultaneously on separate halves of the globe. Together, they were the greatest deployment of military resources by the United States at one time. Because the Battle of Saipan began just over a week after the 6 June landings for Overlord, its importance has often been overlooked, but just as Overlord was a major step in contributing to the fall of the Third Reich, Saipan marked a major step in the collapse of the Empire of Japan.

===Impact on American military strategy===
The availability of Saipan as an American airbase, along with the airbases already established in Chengdu, opened a new phase in the Pacific War, in which strategic bombing would play a major role.
The 15 June invasion of the island had been synchronized with bombing of the Yawata Steel Works by B-29s in China. It was the first bombing of the Japan home islands by B-29s, signaling the beginning of a campaign that could strike deep into Japan&#x27;s Absolute National Defense Zone.

The Army Air Force was confident that strategic bombing could destroy Japan&#x27;s military production and that the Marianas provided excellent airbases for doing so because they were miles from the Japanese home islands. This put almost all of Japan&#x27;s industrial cities within striking distance of the B-29 bomber, and the airbases were easy to defend and supply.

Saipan was the first island to base the B-29s. Construction of an aerodrome for B-29s began on Isely Field – the renamed Aslito Field – on 24 June, before the island was declared secure. The first runway was complete by 19 October and the second by 15 December. The 73rd Bombardment Wing began arriving on 12 October. On 24 November, 111 B-29s set out for Tokyo in the first strategic bombing mission against Japan from the Marianas.

The casualties on Saipan were used by American planners to predict American losses in future engagements. This &quot;Saipan ratio&quot; – one killed American and several wounded for every seven Japanese soldiers killed – became one of the justifications for American planners to increase conscription, projecting an increased need for replacements in the war on Japan. Its prediction of high casualties was part of the reason that the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not approve an invasion of Taiwan. The Saipan ratio guided the initial estimate that the invasion of Japan would cost up to 2,000,000 American casualties, including 500,000 killed. Though these estimates would be revised downward later, they would still influence politicians&#x27; thinking about the war well into 1945.

===Impact on Japanese politics and morale===

Saipan&#x27;s loss had a greater impact in Japan than any of its previous defeats.
The Emperor of Japan, Hirohito, recognized that American control of the island would result in Tokyo being bombed. After the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Philippine Sea, he demanded that the Japanese General Staff plan another naval attack to prevent its fall. Hirohito only accepted Saipan&#x27;s eventual fall on 25 June 1944 when his advisors told him all was lost. The defeat brought the collapse of Hideki Tōjō&#x27;s government. Disappointed with the progress of the war, Hirohito withdrew his support for Tōjō, who resigned as prime minister of Japan on 18 July. He was replaced by former General Kuniaki Koiso, who was a less capable leader.

Saipan&#x27;s fall led the Japanese government&#x27;s war reporting to admit for the first time that the war was going poorly. In July, Imperial General Headquarters published a statement providing a summary of the battle and the loss of the island, and the government allowed a translation of a Time magazine article, which included the civilian suicides on the last days of the battle, to be published in &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot;, Japan&#x27;s largest newspaper, while the battle was in progress. Before the battle had ended, the Japanese government issued the &quot;Outline for the Evacuation of Schoolchildren&quot; in June, anticipating the bombing of Japan&#x27;s cities. This evacuation, the only compulsory one enacted during the war, separated more than 350,000 third-through sixth-graders who lived in major cities from their families and sent them into the countryside.

The capture of Saipan pierced the Absolute National Defense Zone, forcing the Japanese leadership to reconsider the outcomes they could expect for the war.
In July, the Chief of the War Guidance department of Imperial General Headquarters, Colonel Sei Matsutani, drafted a report stating that the conquest of Saipan destroyed all hope of winning the war. After the war, many Japanese military and political leaders stated that Saipan was a turning point as well. For example, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa stated &quot;Our war was lost with the loss of Saipan,&quot; and Fleet Admiral Osami Nagano acknowledged the battle&#x27;s importance, saying &quot;When we lost Saipan, Hell is on us.&quot;

==Memorials==
Suicide Cliff and Banzai Cliff, along with surviving isolated Japanese fortifications, are recognized as historic sites on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The cliffs are part of the National Historic Landmark District Landing Beaches; Aslito/Isley Field; &amp; Marpi Point, Saipan Island, which includes the American landing beaches, the B-29 runways of Isley Field, and the surviving Japanese infrastructure of the Aslito and Marpi Point airfields. The Maritime Heritage Trail has a series of dive sites with submerged ships, planes and tanks from the battle. The American Memorial Park commemorates the American and Mariana people who died during the Mariana Islands campaign, and The Central Pacific War Memorial Monument is dedicated to the memory of the Japanese soldiers and civilians who died.

<text>Vulnerabilities are flaws in a computer system that weaken the overall security of the system. 

Despite intentions to achieve complete correctness, virtually all hardware and software contains bugs where the system does not behave as expected. If the bug could enable an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of system resources, it is called a vulnerability. Insecure software development practices as well as design factors such as complexity can increase the burden of vulnerabilities. There are different types most common in different components such as hardware, operating systems, and applications. 

Vulnerability management is a process that includes identifying systems and prioritizing which are most important, scanning for vulnerabilities, and taking action to secure the system. Vulnerability management typically is a combination of remediation (fixing the vulnerability), mitigation (increasing the difficulty or reducing the danger of exploits), and accepting risks that are not economical or practical to eliminate. Vulnerabilities can be scored for risk according to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System or other systems, and added to vulnerability databases. , there are more than 240,000 vulnerabilities catalogued in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.

A vulnerability is initiated when it is introduced into hardware or software. It becomes active and exploitable when the software or hardware containing the vulnerability is running. The vulnerability may be discovered by the vendor or a third party. Disclosing the vulnerability (as a patch or otherwise) is associated with an increased risk of compromise because attackers often move faster than patches are rolled out. Regardless of whether a patch is ever released to remediate the vulnerability, its lifecycle will eventually end when the system, or older versions of it, fall out of use.

==Causes ==
Despite developers&#x27; goal of delivering a product that works entirely as intended, virtually all software and hardware contains bugs. If a bug creates a security risk, it is called a vulnerability. Software patches are often released to fix identified vulnerabilities, but those that remain unknown (zero days) as well as those that have not been patched are still liable for exploitation. Vulnerabilities vary in their ability to be exploited by malicious actors, and the actual risk is dependent on the nature of the vulnerability as well as the value of the surrounding system. Although some vulnerabilities can only be used for denial of service attacks, more dangerous ones allow the attacker to inject and run their own code (called malware), without the user being aware of it. Only a minority of vulnerabilities allow for privilege escalation, which is necessary for more severe attacks. Without a vulnerability, the exploit cannot gain access. It is also possible for malware to be installed directly, without an exploit, if the attacker uses social engineering or implants the malware in legitimate software that is downloaded deliberately.
===Design factors===
Fundamental design factors that can increase the burden of vulnerabilities include:
*Complexity: Large, complex systems increase the probability of flaws and unintended access points.
*Familiarity: Using common, well-known code, software, operating systems, and/or hardware increases the probability an attacker has or can find the knowledge and tools to exploit the flaw.
*Connectivity: any system connected to the internet can be accessed and compromised. Disconnecting systems from the internet is one truly effective measure against attacks, but it is rarely feasible. 
*Legacy software and hardware is at increased risk, but upgrading often is prohibitive in terms of cost and downtime. 
===Development factors===
Some software development practices can affect the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced to a code base. Lack of knowledge about secure software development or excessive pressure to deliver features quickly can lead to avoidable vulnerabilities to enter production code, especially if security is not prioritized by the company culture. This can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. The more complex the system is, the easier it is for vulnerabilities to go undetected. Some vulnerabilities are deliberately planted, which could be for any reason from a disgruntled employee selling access to cyber criminals, to sophisticated state-sponsored schemes to introduce vulnerabilities to software. Inadequate code reviews can lead to missed bugs, but there are also static code analysis tools that can be used as part of code reviews and may find some vulnerabilities. 

DevOps, a development workflow that emphasizes automated testing and deployment to speed up the deployment of new features, often requires that many developers be granted access to change configurations, which can lead to deliberate or inadvertent inclusion of vulnerabilities. Compartmentalizing dependencies, which is often part of DevOps workflows, can reduce the attack surface by paring down dependencies to only what is necessary. If software as a service is used, rather than the organization&#x27;s own hardware and software, the organization is dependent on the cloud services provider to prevent vulnerabilities.
===National Vulnerability Database classification===
The National Vulnerability Database classifies vulnerabilities into eight root causes that may be overlapping, including:
#Input validation (including buffer overflow and boundary condition) vulnerabilities occur when input checking is not sufficient to prevent the attacker from injecting malicious code.
# Access control vulnerabilities enable an attacker to access a system that is supposed to be restricted to them, or engage in privilege escalation.
#When the system fails to handle and exceptional or unanticipated condition correctly, an attacker can exploit the situation to gain access.
#A configuration vulnerability comes into existence when configuration settings cause risks to the system security, leading to such faults as unpatched software or file system permissions that do not sufficiently restrict access.
#A race condition—when timing or other external factors change the outcome and lead to inconsistent or unpredictable results—can cause a vulnerability.
==Vulnerabilities by component==
===Hardware ===
Deliberate security bugs can be introduced during or after manufacturing and cause the integrated circuit not to behave as expected under certain specific circumstances. Testing for security bugs in hardware is quite difficult due to limited time and the complexity of twenty-first century chips, while the globalization of design and manufacturing has increased the opportunity for these bugs to be introduced by malicious actors.
===Operating system ===

Although operating system vulnerabilities vary depending on the operating system in use, a common problem is privilege escalation bugs that enable the attacker to gain more access than they should be allowed. Open-source operating systems such as Linux and Android have a freely accessible source code and allow anyone to contribute, which could enable the introduction of vulnerabilities. However, the same vulnerabilities also occur in proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Apple operating systems. All reputable vendors of operating systems provide patches regularly.

===Client–server applications===
Client–server applications are downloaded onto the end user&#x27;s computers and are typically updated less frequently than web applications. Unlike web applications, they interact directly with a user&#x27;s operating system. Common vulnerabilities in these applications include:
*Unencrypted data that is in permanent storage or sent over a network is relatively easy for attackers to steal.
*Process hijacking occurs when an attacker takes over an existing computer process.
===Web applications===
Web applications run on many websites. Because they are inherently less secure than other applications, they are a leading source of data breaches and other security incidents. They can include: 
*Authentication and authorization failures enable attackers to access data that should be restricted to trusted users.
*Business logic vulnerability occurs when programmers do not consider unexpected cases arising in business logic.
Attacks used against vulnerabilities in web applications include: 
*Cross-site scripting (XSS) enables attackers to inject and run JavaScript-based malware when input checking is insufficient to reject the injected code. XSS can be persistent, when attackers save the malware in a data field and run it when the data is loaded; it can also be loaded using a malicious URL link (reflected XSS). Attackers can also insert malicious code into the domain object model.
*SQL injection and similar attacks manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access to data.
*Command injection is a form of code injection where the attacker places the malware in data fields or processes. The attacker might be able to take over the entire server.
*Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is creating client requests that do malicious actions, such as an attacker changing a user&#x27;s credentials.
*Server-side request forgery is similar to CSRF, but the request is forged from the server side and often exploits the enhanced privilege of the server.
*Business logic vulnerability occurs when programmers do not consider unexpected cases arising in business logic.

==Management ==
There is little evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different cyberattack prevention measures. Although estimating the risk of an attack is not straightforward, the mean time to breach and expected cost can be considered to determine the priority for remediating or mitigating an identified vulnerability and whether it is cost effective to do so. Although attention to security can reduce the risk of attack, achieving perfect security for a complex system is impossible, and many security measures have unacceptable cost or usability downsides. For example, reducing the complexity and functionality of the system is effective at reducing the attack surface. 

Successful vulnerability management usually involves a combination of remediation (closing a vulnerability), mitigation (increasing the difficulty, and reducing the consequences, of exploits), and accepting some residual risk. Often a defense in depth strategy is used for multiple barriers to attack. Some organizations scan for only the highest-risk vulnerabilities as this enables prioritization in the context of lacking the resources to fix every vulnerability. Increasing expenses is likely to have diminishing returns. 
===Remediation===
Remediation fixes vulnerabilities, for example by downloading a software patch. Software vulnerability scanners are typically unable to detect zero-day vulnerabilities, but are more effective at finding known vulnerabilities based on a database. These systems can find some known vulnerabilities and advise fixes, such as a patch. However, they have limitations including false positives.

Vulnerabilities can only be exploited when they are active-the software in which they are embedded is actively running on the system. Before the code containing the vulnerability is configured to run on the system, it is considered a carrier. Dormant vulnerabilities can run, but are not currently running. Software containing dormant and carrier vulnerabilities can sometimes be uninstalled or disabled, removing the risk. Active vulnerabilities, if distinguished from the other types, can be prioritized for patching.
===Mitigation===
Vulnerability mitigation is measures that do not close the vulnerability, but make it more difficult to exploit or reduce the consequences of an attack. Reducing the attack surface, particularly for parts of the system with root (administrator) access, and closing off opportunities for exploits to engage in privilege exploitation is a common strategy for reducing the harm that a cyberattack can cause. If a patch for third-party software is unavailable, it may be possible to temporarily disable the software.

===Testing ===
A penetration test attempts to enter the system via an exploit to see if the system is insecure. If a penetration test fails, it does not necessarily mean that the system is secure. Some penetration tests can be conducted with automated software that tests against existing exploits for known vulnerabilities. Other penetration tests are conducted by trained hackers. Many companies prefer to contract out this work as it simulates an outsider attack.

== Vulnerability lifecycle ==

The vulnerability lifecycle begins when vulnerabilities are introduced into hardware or software. Detection of vulnerabilities can be by the software vendor, or by a third party. In the latter case, it is considered most ethical to immediately disclose the vulnerability to the vendor so it can be fixed. Government or intelligence agencies buy vulnerabilities that have not been publicly disclosed and may use them in an attack, stockpile them, or notify the vendor. As of 2013, the Five Eyes (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) captured the plurality of the market and other significant purchasers included Russia, India, Brazil, Malaysia, Singapore, North Korea, and Iran. Organized criminal groups also buy vulnerabilities, although they typically prefer exploit kits. 

Even vulnerabilities that are publicly known or patched are often exploitable for an extended period. Security patches can take months to develop, or may never be developed. A patch can have negative effects on the functionality of software and users may need to test the patch to confirm functionality and compatibility. Larger organizations may fail to identify and patch all dependencies, while smaller enterprises and personal users may not install patches. Research suggests that risk of cyberattack increases if the vulnerability is made publicly known or a patch is released. Cybercriminals can reverse engineer the patch to find the underlying vulnerability and develop exploits, often faster than users install the patch.

Vulnerabilities become deprecated when the software or vulnerable versions fall out of use. This can take an extended period of time; in particular, industrial software may not be feasible to replace even if the manufacturer stops supporting it.

==Assessment, disclosure, and inventory ==
===Assessment ===
A commonly used scale for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities is the open-source specification Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). CVSS evaluates the possibility to exploit the vulnerability and compromise data confidentiality, availability, and integrity. It also considers how the vulnerability could be used and how complex an exploit would need to be. The amount of access needed for exploitation and whether it could take place without user interaction are also factored in to the overall score.

===Disclosure===
Someone who discovers a vulnerability may disclose it immediately (full disclosure) or wait until a patch has been developed (responsible disclosure, or coordinated disclosure). The former approach is praised for its transparency, but the drawback is that the risk of attack is likely to be increased after disclosure with no patch available. Some vendors pay bug bounties to those who report vulnerabilities to them. Not all companies respond positively to disclosures, as they can cause legal liability and operational overhead. There is no law requiring disclosure of vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is discovered by a third party that does not disclose to the vendor or the public, it is called a zero-day vulnerability, often considered the most dangerous type because fewer defenses exist. 

===Vulnerability inventory===
The most commonly used vulnerability dataset is Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), maintained by Mitre Corporation. , it has over 240,000 entries This information is shared into other databases, including the United States&#x27; National Vulnerability Database, where each vulnerability is given a risk score using Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) scheme, and Common Weakness Enumeration. CVE and other databases typically do not track vulnerabilities in software as a service products. Submitting a CVE is voluntary for companies that discovered a vulnerability.

==Liability ==
The software vendor is usually not legally liable for the cost if a vulnerability is used in an attack, which creates an incentive to make cheaper but less secure software. Some companies are covered by laws, such as PCI, HIPAA, and Sarbanes-Oxley, that place legal requirements on vulnerability management.

<text>John Gordon Dower (2 September 1900 – 3 October 1947) was an English civil servant and architect, who, as secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks, produced in 1945 the first post-war official report which set out what National Parks in England and Wales should be like.

==Early life==
Dower was born in Ilkley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in September 1900. His father was a Methodist lay preacher and was a director of a steel firm in Leeds. Dower was educated at a local school in Ilkley and he then studied for a degree in architecture at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==The national parks==
In 1929, Dower married Pauline Trevelyan, whose father was Charles Trevelyan; this introduced him into a campaign to protect the wild areas of Britain. Dower prepared a report in the late 1930s, but it was put to one side when the Second World War broke out and he was called up as a Royal Engineer. During his time in the army, Dower contracted virulent tuberculosis and was invalided out of military service. While convalescing at his home in Kirkby Malham, he was asked to compile a report again into the national parks. As he was too ill to drive, Pauline took them around the country so he could make notes, even being detained by the Home Guard in Cornwall.

Dower&#x27;s report was completed in 1943, but it was not published until 1945. The central tenet for the creation of the national parks was:
This report, and a subsequent one by Sir Arthur Hobhouse, laid the foundations for the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 which created the National Park system.
==Personal life==
Dower was a keen rambler and fly-fishermen. he had also once been president of the Ramblers Association. He died from the effects of tuberculosis in Cambo House, near Morpeth, in October 1947. His family scattered his ashes on Ilkley Moor.

John and Pauline Dower had a daughter, Susan, and two sons, Michael and Robin. Michael went on to be a national park officer for the Peak District and also became the director-general of the Countryside Commission between 1992 and 1996.

In 1948, the Malham Youth Hostel, which Dower had designed, was dedicated to him by his wife and father-in-law.

<doc id="1129847" wikidata="Q751805" url="?curid=1129847" title="Daredevil (film)">
<text>Daredevil is a 2003 American superhero film written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, based on the Marvel Comics character
of the same name created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett. The film stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice in the courtroom and on the streets of New York as the masked vigilante Daredevil. Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Colin Farrell, Joe Pantoliano, Jon Favreau, and David Keith also star in supporting roles.

The film began development in 1997 at 20th Century Fox and in 1999 transferred to Columbia Pictures, before New Regency acquired the rights to the character in 2000. Johnson shot the film primarily in Downtown Los Angeles despite the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan setting of the film and comics. Rhythm and Hues Studios were hired to handle the film&#x27;s CGI. Graeme Revell composed the score, which was released on cassette and CD in March 2003, whereas the various artists&#x27; soundtrack album, &quot;&quot;, was released in February.

&quot;Daredevil&quot; was released in the United States on February 14, 2003, by 20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics. The film became the second-biggest February release to that time and went on to a worldwide total gross of $179.2 million against a production budget of $78 million becoming a box-office success. In 2004, an R-rated director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Daredevil&quot; was released, reincorporating approximately 30 minutes of the film, and reviews were more positive than for the theatrical version. A spin-off film, &quot;Elektra&quot;, with Garner reprising her role as Elektra Natchios, was released in 2005 to critical and commercial failure. The rights to the character eventually reverted to Marvel, who rebooted him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) with Charlie Cox in the role, starting with the self-titled Netflix television series. Garner reprised her role as Elektra in the 2024 film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Plot==

As a child, young Matt Murdock is accidentally blinded by radioactive waste shortly after witnessing his father, washed-up boxer Jack &quot;The Devil&quot; Murdock, extorting money for local mob boss Eddie Fallon. Despite this, Matt&#x27;s remaining senses are dramatically enhanced, giving him superhuman agility and sonar-like hearing. Feeling responsible for his son&#x27;s accident, Jack is inspired to abandon his life of crime and recommit to his boxing career, leading to a dramatic comeback. Later, after Fallon reveals that he enabled Jack&#x27;s comeback by bribing his previous opponents to let him win, he attempts to bribe Jack to throw his next match and has him murdered once he refuses.

Years later, an adult Matt works as an attorney in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen with his friend Franklin &quot;Foggy&quot; Nelson, providing legal representation &quot;pro bono&quot; to clients whom he believes are actually innocent. By night, he fights crime as the costumed vigilante &quot;Daredevil&quot;. Ben Urich, a &quot;New York Post&quot; reporter who chronicles Daredevil&#x27;s exploits, attracts attention for a series of articles on &quot;The Kingpin&quot;, a shadowy underworld figure who allegedly controls all of the city&#x27;s organized crime. Unbeknownst to Urich, the Kingpin is actually Wilson Fisk, a brutal mobster who poses as a legitimate businessman.

Matt falls in love with Elektra Natchios, a Greek-American woman skilled in martial arts, unaware that she is the daughter of Fisk&#x27;s lieutenant Nikolas Natchios. Later, when Natchios attempts to end his relationship with Fisk, Fisk hires Bullseye, a hitman with preternatural aim, to kill him. Bullseye steals Daredevil&#x27;s weaponized baton and impales Natchios with it, killing him and framing Daredevil. Afterward, Urich deduces that Matt is Daredevil after realizing that he disguises his baton as a white cane.

Believing Daredevil to be responsible for her father&#x27;s murder, Elektra attempts to take revenge by killing him. Meanwhile, Bullseye is assigned by Fisk to kill Elektra, who tracks Daredevil down and challenges him to a fight before incapacitating him by stabbing him through the shoulder. Daredevil protests that he did not kill her father, but Elektra doesn&#x27;t listen until she forcibly unmasks him and realizes that he is Matt. Moments later, when Bullseye tracks Elektra down, Matt is forced to watch helplessly as Bullseye kills her.

Wounded, Matt takes refuge in a church, but Bullseye ambushes him by exploiting his weakness to loud sound. When the police swarm the church, Bullseye reveals that Kingpin killed Matt&#x27;s father, leaving behind a rose on his body as a calling card. Soon, Matt gains the upper hand and throws Bullseye from the bell tower after an NYPD ESU sniper shoots him through both hands, depriving him of his powerful aim.

Determined to avenge Elektra and his father, Matt ambushes Fisk in his office. In the ensuing fight, he ultimately triumphs against Fisk&#x27;s brute strength by using his sonar hearing to see Fisk after he is drenched in water from a sprinkler head. During their confrontation, Fisk admits that he killed Jack on Fallon&#x27;s orders and that Elektra&#x27;s death was nothing but a casualty. As the police arrive to arrest Fisk, he threatens to reveal Daredevil&#x27;s identity to the world, but Matt points out that no one will ever believe that Daredevil is a blind man.

Some time after Elektra&#x27;s death, Matt visits the roof of his apartment, where the two of them first kissed, and unexpectedly finds Elektra&#x27;s necklace with her name engraved upon it in braille, hinting that she might still be alive. Urich prepares to publish an article revealing Daredevil&#x27;s identity, but decides against it at the last minute, finally accepting that Daredevil&#x27;s efforts have improved the city. He exits the &quot;New York Post&quot; office into the night outside and sees Matt atop a roof, saying &quot;Go get &#x27;em, Matt&quot;, to which Daredevil nods his head and takes off, leaping off the building to pursue his nightly crimefighting routine. Elsewhere, a heavily bandaged Bullseye awakens in a heavily guarded hospital room and kills a fly with a syringe needle.

==Cast==
* Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock / Daredevil: An attorney-at-law who was blinded as a youth in an accident with bio-waste that drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a &quot;sonar-sense&quot;, which allowed him to perceive his surroundings, and makes a silent promise with his father to &quot;stick up for the long shots&quot;. His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that &quot;comic-strip stuff isn&#x27;t really my cup of tea, really.&quot; Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. He claimed that he and Ben &quot;loved that comic book but I just didn&#x27;t quite believe in the script or the director at the time.&quot; Edward Norton, Matthew Davis and Colin Farrell (who would play Bullseye in the final product), were also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it &quot;serendipity in action&quot; that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith created the &quot;Guardian Devil&quot; series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a child, and explained why he took the role by saying &quot;Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me.&quot; Additionally, he said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up.&quot;
** Scott Terra as Young Matt Murdock: Terra was officially announced as a part of the cast in March 2002.
* Jennifer Garner as Elektra Natchios: The daughter of billionaire Nikolas Natchios and the love interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age, she witnessed the murder of her mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Kate Winslet, Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, &quot;I think she&#x27;s strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She&#x27;d be a good role model.&quot; Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, &quot;[T]he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [that] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn&#x27;t had anything.&quot; Garner would reprise her role in the 2005 film &quot;Elektra&quot;.
* Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin: By appearance, he is an overweight corporate head that takes the name Wilson Fisk, but in fact he is the sole person running organized crime, under the moniker of Kingpin. Kingpin is the murderer of Matt&#x27;s father, and the man responsible for the hiring of Bullseye, with the intention of having the Natchios family murdered. Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Duncan&#x27;s biggest concern was that he was black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white. Also, Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot;. He spoke on the fan&#x27;s loyalty to the source material by saying &quot;they watch movies to say, &#x27;Hey, that&#x27;s not like the comic book.&#x27; But I want them to get past that and just see the movie for what it is and see me for what I am—an actor.&quot;
* Colin Farrell as Bullseye: An assassin with perfect accuracy and deep-rooted pride of it who is hired by Kingpin to kill Nikolas and Elektra Natchios, but when Daredevil gets involved and causes him to miss his target, he makes it his own personal vendetta to take Daredevil down. Farrell was attached to the role in December 2001. Mark Steven Johnson credits Joe Quesada with talking him out of using the traditional Bullseye costume for the film, and Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent as this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. Farrell had to read Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot; comics to understand Bullseye &quot;because the expression on the character&#x27;s faces in the comic books, and just the way they move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I&#x27;m playing [...] he&#x27;s so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it&#x27;s not exactly a character you can do method acting for ... you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips.&quot;
* Jon Favreau as Franklin &quot;Foggy&quot; Nelson: Matt Murdock&#x27;s legal partner and best friend, he is also used as a form of comic relief. Seth Rogen auditioned for the role, but he was rejected as he was deemed &quot;too young&quot; for the role. Favreau joined the cast in February 2002.
* Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich: An investigative journalist whose articles notably relate to Daredevil, and the Kingpin. During the film, he goes on to uncover a lot of information about the two. Pantoliano was cast in March 2002. Urich works for the &quot;New York Post&quot; rather than the fictional &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; as in the comics, because the film rights to the &quot;Bugle&quot; were held by Sony Pictures at that time due to it being associated with Spider-Man.
* David Keith as Jack Murdock: Father of Matt Murdock and a boxer, he is murdered by the Kingpin when he does not take a fall for a fight. Keith was officially announced as a part of the cast in March 2002.
* Leland Orser as Wesley Owen Welch: The number two of Wilson Fisk, but he does not like to be involved in the activities of the Kingpin.
* Lennie Loftin as Detective Nick Manolis: A NYPD cop who considers Daredevil an urban legend.
* Erick Avari as Nikolas Natchios: The father of Elektra, who is murdered by Bullseye on behalf of the Kingpin.
* Ellen Pompeo as Karen Page: The secretary at Matt Murdock and Franklin Nelson&#x27;s law firm.
* Derrick O&#x27;Connor as Father Everett: A priest of Matt Murdock&#x27;s local church, where he sometimes goes to find solace.
Stan Lee, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith, each notable for their work on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; comics, also have cameo roles throughout the film with the latter playing a forensics assistant named &quot;Jack Kirby&quot;. Paul Ben-Victor portrays Jose Quesada, a criminal Daredevil hunts who is named after Joe Quesada. Mark Margolis has an uncredited role as Eddie Fallon, a mobster who once employed Fisk as a hitman. Kane Hodder makes an appearance as Fallon&#x27;s bodyguard. Claudine Farrell, Colin Farrell&#x27;s sister and personal assistant on the film, has an uncredited vocal cameo as Heather Glenn on Matt Murdock&#x27;s answering machine and cameos in the pub scene. Josie DiVincenzo portrays Josie, a character from the comics who is the owner of Josie&#x27;s Bar, a regular hangout in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. The director&#x27;s cut version also features Coolio as Dante Jackson and features Jude Ciccolella in a sub-plot removed from the theatrical version. Tanoai Reed appears uncredited as a thug in Josie&#x27;s Bar.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1997, 20th Century Fox optioned the film rights of the character Daredevil from Marvel Comics, and Chris Columbus was set to direct the film adaptation. In 1998, Marvel was facing bankruptcy. During this time, 20th Century Fox allowed the option to expire, so Disney, who later went to purchase Marvel&#x27;s rights to all of its property in 2012, began negotiations in order to acquire the rights. In 1999, the negotiations failed to work out, so Marvel set the project up with Columbia Pictures. During this time, Columbus and Carlo Carlei co-wrote a script together, before Mark Steven Johnson got signed to write the screenplay. By 2000, Columbia decided to cancel the project, as the two companies reportedly could not come to an agreement over digital rights.

New Regency entered negotiations with a more satisfying offer, attaining the character rights from Marvel in 2000 to produce the film, with 20th Century Fox handling the distribution. Mark Steven Johnson was rehired and his script was turned in during 2001, which was praised by Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&#x27; Harry Knowles. Prior to shooting, producer Gary Foster said that, in comparison to other comic book-based films before it, the film would be &quot;more character-driven ... darker ... edgier,&quot; while Marvel Studios executive Kevin Feige felt the script was one of the strongest Marvel had received. 20th Century Fox raised the budget for the film, after the success of Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.

===Filming===

Filming began March 2002. Fox wanted to start filming in Canada in order to save money. This plan was contended by Johnson, and the film&#x27;s cinematographer, Ericson Core, after they found a preferred area for shooting around downtown Los Angeles&#x27; Arcade Building. Core noted that the appeal came from the &quot;beautiful, old brick buildings and great rooftops,&quot; which they felt was perfect for a depiction of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan, in comparison to the studio&#x27;s choice where the filming would be done in Montreal or Vancouver. Due to their insistence, coupled with Ben Affleck&#x27;s disinterest in filming in Canada (after having filmed there for his previous film, &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;) they were able to change the studio&#x27;s mind.
When the look of the film was being decided, Mark Steven Johnson opted to use direct scenes from the &quot;Daredevil&quot; comics. Joe Quesada&#x27;s artistic take in &quot;Guardian Devil&quot; (&quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 2, #1–#8) was an influence on the film, with Johnson noting that they would &quot;literally take out a scene from the comic book that Joe did [...] Here&#x27;s Daredevil on the cross, you know, it&#x27;s that scene from &#x27;Guardian Devil&#x27;. You just shoot that.&quot; Throughout the film, Ben Affleck had to wear &quot;cataract milky-blue&quot; contacts, which would effectively make him blind. This was considered great by Johnson, as it would aid his performance.

The sound plays an integral part in the film, as the superhero relies on it in order to form his &#x27;sonar sense&#x27;. Post-production sound was done by supervising sound editor John Larsen and sound designer Steve Boeddeker and is heard taking place immediately after Matt&#x27;s optic nerve is seen mutating. The mutating of the nerve was done by Rhythm and Hues Studios, who also worked on the sonar-sense which became referred to as the &quot;shadow world&quot;. Shadow world was made using just CGI except in a scene where Elektra and Matt Murdock are in the rain, which was done using CGI over film.

==Music==

The soundtrack to the film, &quot;&quot;, was released in February 2003. It features songs from various artists, including &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; by Evanescence, &quot;Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot; by Fuel, and &quot;For You&quot; by the Calling.

The score to &quot;Daredevil&quot; was written by Graeme Revell, and released on March 4, 2003. He was attracted to the focus of &quot;human-ness&quot; on Daredevil, torn emotionally and physically by his superhero status. Avi Arad asked Revell to concentrate more on the emotions of Daredevil and Elektra, while Mark Steven Johnson wanted to stay clear from any gothic and action movie clichés. Revell tried to avoid too much individual motifs but some characters would have an identifiable sound, like Bullseye would have guitar undertones, while Kingpin would have bass beats. Guitarist Mike Einziger of Incubus collaborated with Revell for any additional rock elements. Revell described the director as &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;responsive&quot; when it came to experimenting (as opposed to feeling &quot;locked in a box of preconceptions&quot;) which he felt led to &quot;cool stuff&quot;. Varèse Sarabande put together the score record.

==Marketing==
Aside from expected TV commercials during such TV hits as &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, as well as one in the second quarter of Super Bowl XXXVII, there was also a tie-in with Kraft, an in-store promotion at Wal-Mart, a marketing campaign with Hamilton Watch Company, who designed the watch Matt wears in the film, and a weeklong &quot;Daredevil&quot; segment on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. As part of an online form of marketing, a viral e-mail drive was started, where participants would be entered in a contest where they could win prizes such as &quot;Daredevil&quot; T-shirts, Game Boy Advance games, and cufflinks. To enter the drawing, the user had to book tickets for the film online, then pass an e-mail on to someone else. The idea was to encourage online ticket booking, which at the time was seen as a growing trend.

===Video game===

The Game Boy Advance &quot;Daredevil&quot; game was released on February 14, 2003, and was created by Encore, a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation.

==Release==
===Censorship===
Due to the film&#x27;s violent scenes, the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia banned &quot;Daredevil&quot; in that country. 20th Century Fox unsuccessfully appealed to Malaysia&#x27;s censorship board to change its decision, hoping to release the film in Malaysia on February 27, 2003. The deputy prime minister told the press films were banned if containing what the board felt was &quot;excessive violence and sexual material or elements which can create chaos in the community&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened theatrically on February 14, 2003, on 3,471 screens in North America and took first place in its opening weekend, grossing $40.3 million. At the time, it became the second-biggest February release, behind &quot;Hannibal&quot;. By the second weekend the film saw a 55.1% decline in takings but managed to maintain the number one spot, beating new release &quot;Old School&quot; by $639,093. By the third weekend, &quot;Daredevil&quot; saw a further 38.5% drop in sales, and so fell to third place at the box office. The film grossed $102.5 million in North America, and $76.6 million in the rest of the world, totalling the film&#x27;s worldwide takings at just $179.2 million, grossing over double its budget of $78 million. Avi Arad addressed the top spot success by saying &quot;we are five for five with record-breaking box office successes [with &quot;Blade&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Blade II&quot; then &quot;Spider-Man&quot;] and have two more Marvel releases slated for this summer [which are &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot; and &quot;Hulk&quot;]. It&#x27;s a testament to the broad appeal of these characters before mainstream audiences outside of the core comic fans. These super heroes have been successful within the Marvel pantheon for decades; it only makes sense that their translations to the big screen are just as fruitful.&quot;

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes of critics gave the film positive feedback, based on reviews, with an average rating of . The critical consensus reads, &quot;While Ben Affleck fits the role and the story is sporadically interesting, &quot;Daredevil&quot; is ultimately a dull, brooding origin story that fails to bring anything new to the genre.&quot; On the website Metacritic the film has an average score of 42 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and called the film good, despite noting the almost-typical superhero background. Of the actors, he stated that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles, while Michael Clarke Duncan&#x27;s presence alone was menacing. He said, &quot;I am getting a little worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes [...] Some of their movies, like this one, are better than others.&quot; The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;″s Bruce Westbrook considered it &quot;the best Marvel movie to date, it&#x27;s as well-written and character-driven as some of today&#x27;s Oscar contenders, and its story doesn&#x27;t stall with hollow flamboyance.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Kimberly Jones praised the film, the actors, and felt that though an unproven director, &quot;Johnson has just signed his meal ticket with this marriage of big brains, big brawn, and–most happily–big heart.&quot;

Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film four out of five stars, and felt people &quot;will like the characters more than the film,&quot; before adding that there are enough strong moments to guarantee a good viewing. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Peter Bradshaw stated that the film had &quot;unconvincing touches&quot; but was more enjoyable than &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and as dark as Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;. BBC film critic Nev Pierce believed the film had spectacular set-pieces, but felt there was no strong narrative arc to keep the viewer interested. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s Joe Morgenstern considered the film to be neither original nor great but felt it maintained &quot;many grace notes and interesting oddities.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s Rick Groen said the film was &quot;not woeful, not wonderful, merely watchable.&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;″s Steven Rea thought the film brought a variance of humor and violence, but felt it didn&#x27;t work as well as it could have. James Berardinelli felt it was merely a satisfactory superhero film. &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Frank Lovece said &quot;Daredevil&quot; &quot;makes clear that superhero films are the next evolutionary generation of action movies: Now that Schwarzenegger-styled heroes have upped the action ante as far as the human body can go and remain even marginally believable, it&#x27;s up to superheroes ... to take it further.&quot; He also felt it was &quot;a movie for grown-ups, not kids.&quot;

Negative reviews included that of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Elvis Mitchell, who said the film was &quot;second-rate and ordinary,&quot; while &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Todd McCarthy considered it &quot;a pretender in the realm of bona-fide superheroes.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman gave the film a &quot;C−&quot;, criticizing the story as &quot;sloppy&quot; and &quot;slipshod&quot;, saying, &quot;&quot;Daredevil&quot; is the sort of half-assed, visually-lackadaisical potboiler that makes you rue the day that comic-book franchises ever took over Hollywood.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s Trevor Johnston praised Ben Affleck, feeling he &quot;persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing,&quot; but also felt writer/director Johnson&#x27;s construction fails all involved in the film. &quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s David Edelstein wrote that the film was derivative of &quot;Batman&quot;, but concluded by saying &quot;that&#x27;s not so bad: The movie looks best when it looks like other, better movies.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Michael Wilmington thought the film grabs the attention, but felt it does not reward it. Character co-creator Stan Lee himself said, &quot;[T]hey just wrote the whole thing wrong. They made him too tragic.&quot; Ben Affleck won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his work in the movie, his third after &quot;Gigli&quot; and &quot;Paycheck&quot;.

Affleck himself disliked and disowned the film, and said that it inspired him to take on the role of Batman in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s the movie I want to do. I want to be a part of that [&quot;Batman v Superman&quot;]. Part of it was I wanted for once to get one of these movies and do it right—to do a good version. I hate &quot;Daredevil&quot; so much.&quot; Affleck also called the film &quot;kinda silly&quot;.

For the 20th anniversary of the film, Mark Steven Johnson said:&quot;Looking back on it, one of the mistakes I made with the film was wanting to put everything in! I wanted to do Daredevil&#x27;s origin story, and I wanted to do the Elektra Saga and I wanted to introduce Bullseye and Foggy. I wanted everything to be in there, but the film could only support so much. And then when you&#x27;re told to cut a half-hour out and make it more of a love story, things start to feel rushed and not quite right. It&#x27;s a fan thing: when you love something so much, you want to tell it all.&quot;

===Director&#x27;s cut===
A director&#x27;s cut of the film was announced for a spring 2004 DVD release. This version contained new additions like previously unseen footage and a removed subplot, and was to be a bit darker with an R rating. The film, released in 2.35:1 widescreen format, was released with DTS and Dolby Digital sound. The new version of the film has newly recorded commentary to accompany it, featuring Mark Steven Johnson and Avi Arad. A &quot;Making of Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; featurette also accompanied the film. The release date of the DVD was later pushed back to November 30, 2004. On September 30, 2008, the director&#x27;s cut was released on Blu-ray. The DVD release of the director&#x27;s cut removed the bonus material included on the theatrical cut&#x27;s DVD release, but that content was restored for the Blu-ray release (although the Blu-ray release only contains the director&#x27;s cut).

One of the biggest changes to the film was the addition of a subplot involving a drug addict played by Coolio, who was charged with killing a prostitute informant who was feeding Urich info on the Kingpin. This subplot is missing from the theatrical version of the film, but is present in the novelization by Greg Cox, published in 2003.

Executive producer Kevin Feige commented on this version of the film, believing &quot;the people who had other opinions [of &quot;Daredevil&quot;] will be won over by this new version.&quot; Reviewer Danny Graydon of &quot;Empire&quot; called it a &quot;considerable improvement on the original version,&quot; notably preferring the more violent undertones, a lesser focus on the romance, and the equal focus of Daredevil and his lawyer alias Matt Murdock and the subplot involving Coolio. Some critics continued to feel Affleck was unsuitable as Daredevil and that Duncan portrayed the Kingpin in an over-the-top manner. IGN&#x27;s Jeff Otto and Andy Patrizio deemed this version an improvement over the original: They felt this version was more loyal to the Frank Miller feel of the Daredevil world, with more focus on themes such as Murdock&#x27;s struggle with his Catholic upbringing. On the whole they felt the film would be far more pleasing to fans, and overall better than the theatrical release. Comic-book enthusiasts have gauged the director&#x27;s cut as one of the better recuts of a superhero film.

==Legacy==
===Cancelled sequel===
During 2004, Ben Affleck shot a cameo role for the spin-off film, &quot;Elektra&quot;, at the request of &quot;Daredevil&quot; co-star Jennifer Garner, but the scene was ultimately cut from the film. In October 2004, Affleck stated he would only return in the lead role if Fox would renegotiate to tell the darker stories of Daredevil, and showed interest in the &quot;Guardian Devil&quot; graphic novel, as well as the &quot;Born Again&quot; storyline. In November 2006, Affleck stated that he would never reprise the role, having felt &quot;by playing a superhero in Daredevil, I have inoculated myself from ever playing another superhero ... Wearing a costume was a source of humiliation for me and something I wouldn&#x27;t want to do again soon.&quot; Despite this, Affleck would later sign on to portray the DC superhero, Batman, in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;.

In July 2006, Michael Clarke Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin, but stated that he would not be willing to gain weight as he felt &quot;comfortable&quot; being down to 270 pounds. He jokingly showed willingness to change his mind if he was offered $20 million. Duncan suggested that the character is portrayed to have been training a lot in jail in order to become faster in combat against Daredevil, also working as a way to fit his weight loss into the story.
Duncan would later go on to reprise his role as the Kingpin in an episode of the animated series: &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot;. He has also moved on to appear in other comic book films like the 2005 crime film &quot;Sin City&quot; as Manute and the 2011 DC superhero film &quot;Green Lantern&quot; as Kilowog. Duncan died on September 3, 2012.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

In 2004, Feige had stated on potential future Daredevil films, &quot;there are many more stories to be told with old Hornhead and we&#x27;d love to tell them someday.&quot; Avi Arad has also said that a sequel will begin development once the rights go from 20th Century Fox to Marvel Studios. Director Mark Steven Johnson showed interest in returning to direct with the &quot;Born Again&quot; storyline, as well as suggesting Mr. Fear as a possible villain. as Johnson liked the concept of the &quot;Man Without Fear&quot; taking on a villain who embodies fear itself.

In July 2008, Jason Statham expressed interest in appearing as Daredevil in the future. Statham requested &quot;just give me the chance, I would love to be Daredevil.&quot; Frank Miller commented in agreement, &quot;I think he should be Daredevil too.&quot; In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said &quot;a &quot;Daredevil&quot; reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about.&quot; Rothman added that &quot;what it really needs is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision.&quot; By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. &quot;Fringe&quot; writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film.

Later, it was announced that in the event that a sequel or reboot had not started filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the &quot;Daredevil&quot; franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, but Carnahan said that his pitch, Daredevil as a hard-boiled &#x27;70s-style thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix &quot;Daredevil&quot; television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.

In July 2023, it was reported that Garner would appear in the 2024 film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, which deals with the concept of the multiverse, reprising her role as Elektra.

<doc id="1129850" wikidata="Q969671" url="?curid=1129850" title="Abbotsford International Airport">
<text>Abbotsford International Airport is located in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, southwest of the city centre. It is the second largest airport in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, after Vancouver International Airport (YVR), and is in close proximity to British Columbia Highway 1, and the US border. It is located about from downtown Vancouver.

YXX offers daily domestic scheduled services and seasonal international scheduled services. The airport is equipped with a CAT 1 instrument landing system, on-site aircraft rescue and firefighting, and a fully serviced air terminal building with customs and passenger screening. It is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) for all scheduled international arrivals. CBSA also provides clearance services to all general aviation aircraft with no more than 15 passengers.

Abbotsford Airport has a longstanding general aviation community and an established aerospace community, including Cascade Aerospace, the Conair Group, and the University of the Fraser Valley Aerospace Centre.

Abbotsford Airport is also home to the Abbotsford Shell Aerocentre FBO and flying schools, such as Coastal Pacific Aviation, Principal Air and Chinook Helicopters. YXX is highly visible to the public due to the Abbotsford International Airshow, Defense &amp; Security Expo, and Tradex events centre.

The facility covers 519 hectares (1,282 acres, 2.0 square miles) of airport property.

There are approximately of land immediately available for airside and landside development. In 2023, 1,275,484 passengers passed through Abbotsford International Airport.

In 2018, the airport announced it will undergo a $5 million, 14,000-square-foot expansion to add new gates and additional passenger seating capacity.

==History==
===World War II (1940–1945)===
The Royal Canadian Air Force purchased the land to build Abbotsford Airport in 1940. In 1943 the construction of the three runways based on a triangular layout was complete. The same year, under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the No. 24 Elementary Flying Training School started operations from this location until 1944. The No 5 Operational Conversion Unit was split between Abbotsford and Boundary Bay Airport.

====Aerodrome information====

In approximately 1942, the aerodrome was listed at with a Var. 23.5 degrees E and no listed elevation. The aerodrome was listed as &quot;Under construction - Servicable&quot; and had three runways as follows:


===Post war (1945–1997)===
Following World War II, the airport was largely used for general aviation and as a secondary field to Vancouver International Airport. Prior to the use of instrument landing systems, fog could make Vancouver Airport unusable and flights had to land at Abbotsford. If a big earthquake floods or otherwise damages low-lying Vancouver Airport on Sea Island in Richmond, then as many flights as possible will likely be looking to land at Abbotsford Airport.

The airport became the home to Skyways Air Services and Conair Aviation in the 1960s. Abbotsford is still the primary base for Conair&#x27;s fleet of water bombers.

In September 1984, Pope John Paul II held an open-air mass for over 200,000 people at the airport.

===Current (1997–present)===
On January 1, 1997, the ownership of the Abbotsford Airport was transferred from the Department of Transport to the City of Abbotsford for a sum of $10. In June of that year, Abbotsford became a jet passenger airport in with the start of scheduled service to Alberta by WestJet. Prior, Airspeed Aviation had been the exclusive operator offering regional service to Victoria, B.C. since 1986. Canada 3000 was the first airline to offer transcontinental service from Abbotsford to Toronto in June 2000. Abbotsford&#x27;s first international charter flight was to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in December 2003 by tour operator Transat Holidays.

Since 2000, many airlines and tour operators have come and gone from Abbotsford, including Air Canada, Air Canada Tango, Air Canada Jazz, Air North, Canada 3000, Central Mountain Air, Helijet, Jetsgo, Signature Vacations, Zoom Airlines, Harmony Airways, Peace Air and ZIP Air.

In 2010, a new parallel taxiway was added alongside runway 07/25, and the main airport apron was extended. An aircraft run-up bay that can accommodate up to three medium weight category aircraft at the same time was added near the Cascade Aerospace hangar.

From 2017, Abbotsford International Airport began to see a resurgence in air passenger numbers, with the introduction of service to Edmonton and Calgary with WestJet. In 2018, Flair Airlines introduced additional flights to Edmonton, and new flights to Winnipeg and Hamilton. Swoop, WestJet&#x27;s ULCC subsidiary, began similar operations, with flights to Edmonton, Winnipeg, Hamilton, London (ON), Las Vegas, and seasonal flights to Mazatlán and Puerto Vallarta. Air Canada Rouge used to offer seasonal service to Toronto between June and October since 2015. This service was initially suspended in 2019 due to the Boeing 737 MAX groundings and once again in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has never returned since.

==Airshow==
Since 1962, the airport has hosted the annual Abbotsford International Airshow usually held the second weekend in August. Designated as Canada&#x27;s national airshow in the mid 1970s by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, it is Canada&#x27;s largest airshow as well as one of North America&#x27;s largest airshows. It has been listed as one of the ten best airshows in the world. it draws airplane enthusiasts from all over Western Canada and the Northwestern United States. The static displays allow people to get up close to many of the exhibits while numerous performances decorate the skies above.
The International Council of Airshows awarded a Silver Pinnacle Award to the airshow in 2014.

==Ground transportation==
The airport is serviced by Central Fraser Valley Transit Route 21, which connects Aldergrove with Bourquin Exchange in Abbotsford. Per the rider guide dated 2017-09-03, it is unlikely that this service will be useful to airline passengers.

The airport is served by Ebus, on their route between Vancouver and Kamloops/Kelowna and Rider Express on their route from Vancouver to Calgary. Ebus is a carrier based in Alberta.

<doc id="1129854" wikidata="Q1059948" url="?curid=1129854" title="Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan">
<text>Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (; 7 September 1948 – 13 May 2022) was the second president of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi, serving from November 2004 until his death in May 2022.

Khalifa was the eldest son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first president of the United Arab Emirates. As crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa carried out some aspects of the presidency in a &quot;de facto&quot; capacity from the late 1990s when his father experienced health problems. He succeeded his father as the ruler of Abu Dhabi on 2 November 2004, and the Federal Supreme Council elected him as president of the UAE the following day. As ruler of Abu Dhabi, he attracted cultural and academic centres to Abu Dhabi, helping establish the Louvre Abu Dhabi, New York University Abu Dhabi and Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi. He also established Etihad Airways.

During Khalifa&#x27;s presidency, the United Arab Emirates became a regional economic powerhouse and its non-oil economy grew. Khalifa was viewed as a pro-Western modernizer whose low-key approach helped steer the country through a tense era in regional politics and forged closer ties with the United States and Israel. As president during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, he directed the payment of billions of dollars in emergency bailout funds into Dubai. On 4 January 2010, the world&#x27;s tallest man-made structure, originally known as Burj Dubai, was renamed the Burj Khalifa in his honor.

In January 2014, Khalifa had a stroke and was in stable condition after surgery. He then assumed a lower profile in state affairs but retained ceremonial presidential powers. His half-brother Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan carried out public affairs of the state and day-to-day decision-making of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. In 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; named Khalifa in its list of the world&#x27;s most powerful people. Following his death on 13 May 2022, Khalifa was succeeded by his brother Mohamed.

== Early life and education ==
Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed was born on 7 September 1948 at Qasr Al-Muwaiji, Al Ain, in Abu Dhabi (then part of the Trucial States), the eldest son of Hassa bint Mohammed Al Nahyan and Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. He spent most of his childhood in Al Ain. 

Sheikh Khalifa&#x27;s early education began with the traditional learning of the tenets of Islam by Sheikh Thani Bin Ahmed, a mutawa (religious teacher). Due to the lack of formal schools in Al Ain during the early 1950&#x27;s, Sheikh Zayed, Sheikh Khalifa&#x27;s father, arranged for a qualified tutor from Muscat, Mohammed Bin Rashid Altamimi who then ran a small school in Muwaiji established by Sheikh Zayed around 1956. It was one of Sheikh Zayed’s priorities that Sheikh Khalifa and his siblings receive a comprehensive education. Sheikh Khalifa, along with other members of the royal family, continued their early education in the Al Nahyaneia Model School in the academic year 1960-1961, providing encouragement for education in the area. Later, Sheikh Khalifa pursued further academic studies in another school named Alfalah. He later graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

In addition to his formal education, Sheikh Khalifa regularly attended his father Sheikh Zayed&#x27;s Majlis, where he gained experience in political affairs and governance, preparing him for future leadership. Alongside that, he developed a strong interest in traditional sports such as horse and camel racing. 

== Political career ==
=== As ruler&#x27;s representative and crown prince: 1966–1971 ===

When his father, Zayed, became emir of Abu Dhabi in 1966, Khalifa was appointed the ruler&#x27;s representative in the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi and head of the Courts Department in Al Ain. Zayed was the ruler&#x27;s representative in the Eastern Region before he became the emir of Abu Dhabi. A few months later the position was handed to Tahnoun bin Mohammed Al Nahyan.

On 1 February 1969, Khalifa was nominated the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, and on the next day he was appointed head of the Abu Dhabi Department of Defense. In that post, he oversaw the build up of the Abu Dhabi Defense Force, which after 1971 became the core of the UAE Armed Forces.

=== As deputy prime minister: 1973–1977 ===
Following the establishment of the UAE in 1971, Khalifa assumed several positions in Abu Dhabi as head of the Abu Dhabi Cabinet. After the reconstruction of the Cabinet of the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi Cabinet was replaced by the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, and Khalifa became the 2nd deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (23 December 1973) and the chairman of the Executive Council of Abu Dhabi (20 January 1974).

In March 1976, His Highness took on the task of founding with his father and leading the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). This organization strategically oversees the emirate’s financial investments with ensuring a stable income for future generations.

In May 1976, he became deputy commander of the UAE Armed Forces, under the president. He also became the head of the Supreme Petroleum Council in the late 1980s. The post granted him wide powers in energy matters. He was also the chairman of the Environmental Research and Wildlife Development Agency.

In 1981, he established the Abu Dhabi Department of Social Services and Commercial Building as well as the Khalifa Housing Fund to help and support constructions of residential and commercial buildings. This initiative sparked construction around Abu Dhabi. 

=== As president: 2004–2022 ===
He succeeded to the post of emir of Abu Dhabi and was elected president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 3 November 2004, replacing his father Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who had died the day before. He had been acting president since his father became ill prior to his death.

On 1 December 2005, Khalifa announced that half of the members of the Federal National Council (FNC), an assembly that advises the president, would be indirectly elected. Half of the council&#x27;s members were still appointed by the leaders of the emirates.

In 2009, Khalifa was re-elected as president for a second five-year term. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2019.
In 2010, Khalifa was described in a WikiLeaks cable signed by then U.S. ambassador Richard G. Olson as a &quot;distant and uncharismatic personage.&quot; The cable said that Khalifa had risked his reputation and the UAE&#x27;s future since 1990, when he described the United States as willing to shed blood to maintain international order and stability in the Gulf.

In March 2011, Khalifa sent the United Arab Emirates Air Force to support the military intervention in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi, alongside forces from NATO, Qatar, Sweden and Jordan.

Khalifa pledged the full support of the UAE to the Bahrain in the face of pro-democracy uprising in 2011.

Later that year Khalifa was ranked as the world&#x27;s fourth-wealthiest monarch, with a fortune estimated to be worth $15 billion. In 2013, he commissioned &quot;Azzam&quot;, the longest motor yacht ever built and measuring long, with a cost between $400–600 million.

In January 2014, Khalifa had a stroke and was reported to have been in a stable condition after undergoing an operation. He was rarely seen in public after, and, with his health deteriorating, his brother, the crown prince, took over as the de facto ruler.

During his presidency in February 2022, the UAE normalised relations with Israel and signed partnership agreements on tourism and healthcare.

== Personal life ==

Khalifa was the eldest son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and Hassa bint Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan. This made him his father&#x27;s representative, being the eldest son in the family. 

He was married to Shamsa bint Suhail Al Mazrouei, on October 18,1964. Sheikha Shamsa Bint Suhail was from a famous Al Khamis family of the Al Shikr branch of the Mazaria tribe in Liwa. Sheikh Khalifa and Sheikha Shamsa had eight children:

• Sultan bin Khalifa al Nahyan is married to Sheikha bint Saif al Nahyan. They have 3 sons and 3 daughters together.

• Mohammed bin Khalifa al Nahyan is married to a daughter of late Sultan bin Zayed al Nahyan and has 3 sons.

• Sheikha bint Khalifa al Nahyan is married to Hamad bin Tahnoun al Nahyan and have 3 sons and 3 daughters.

• Osha bint Khalifa al Nahyan is married to Sultan bin Hamdan al Nahyan and have 6 sons and 1 daughter.

• Mouza bint Khalifa al Nahyan is married to Khalifa bin Saif al Nahyan and have 3 sons and 5 daughters.

• Salama bint Khalifa al Nahyan is married to Mansour bin Tahnoun al Nahyan and have 3 sons and 1 daughter.

• Latifa bint Khalifa al Nahyan married Diyab bin Tahnoun al Nahyan in 2012. They have 1 son and 2 daughters together.

• Shamma bint Khalifa al Nahyan is married to Sultan bin Hamdan bin Zayed al Nahyan and have 3 sons.

== Investments and foreign aid ==
Seychellois government records show that, between 1995 and 2010, Sheikh Khalifa had spent $2 million buying up more than 66 acres of land on the Seychelles&#x27; main island of Mahé, where what was to be his palace was being built. The Seychelles&#x27; government has received large aid packages from the UAE, most notably a $130 million injection that was used in social service and military aid, which funded patrol boats for the Seychelles&#x27; anti-piracy efforts. In 2008, the UAE came to the indebted Seychelles government&#x27;s aid, with a $30 million injection.

Sheikh Khalifa paid $500,000 for the 29.8-acre site of his palace in 2005, according to the sales document. A Seychelles planning authority initially rejected the palace&#x27;s building plans, a decision overturned by President James Michel&#x27;s cabinet. A month after the start of construction of the palace, the national utility company warned that the site&#x27;s plans posed threats to the water supply. Joel Morgan, the Seychelles&#x27; minister of the environment, said the government did not tender the land because it wanted it to go to Sheikh Khalifa. Morgan said &quot;the letter of the law&quot; might not have been followed in the land sale.

In February 2010, the sewage system set up by Ascon, the company building the palace, for the site&#x27;s construction workers overflowed, sending rivers of waste through the region, which is home to more than 8000 residents. Local government agencies and officials from Khalifa&#x27;s office responded quickly to the problem, sending in technical experts and engineers. Government officials concluded that Ascon ignored health and building codes for their workers, and fined the company $81,000. Ascon blamed the incident on &quot;unpredicted weather conditions&quot;. Khalifa&#x27;s presidential office offered to pay $15 million to replace the water-piping system for the mountainside, and Seychelles&#x27; government representatives and residents say Ascon has offered to pay roughly $8,000 to each of the 360 households that were affected by the pollution.

Through the Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation, the UAE supported the Yemeni people in August 2015 with 3,000 tonnes of food and aid supplies. By 19 August 2015, the foundation had sent Yemen 7,800 tonnes of food, medicine, and medical supplies.

In April 2016, Sheikh Khalifa was named in the Panama Papers by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists; he reportedly owned luxury properties in London worth more than $1.7 billion via shell companies that Mossack Fonseca set up and administers for him in the British Virgin Islands.

==Death==
Sheikh Khalifa died on 13 May 2022, at the age of 73. He was buried at Al Bateen Cemetery in Abu Dhabi. His half-brother Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan succeeded him as ruler of Abu Dhabi upon his death, and was elected president of the UAE the next day.

The Ministry of Presidential Affairs announced a 40-day national mourning with flags at half-mast along with a three-day suspension of work in private firms and the official entities at the federal and local levels of institution. State mourning was also announced in many other Arab League nations. Bahrain, Lebanon, Oman, Mauritania, Qatar, Egypt, Morocco, Maldives declared official mourning and flags at half-mast for three days. In Jordan, mourning was declared for 40 days while flags flew at half-mast in Kuwait. Saudi Arabia declared three days of mourning with all recreational, sporting events and festivities postponed. Pakistan announced a three-day mourning and flags were raised at half-mast. Brazil declared three days of mourning, Algeria declared two days of mourning with flags to be flown at half-mast. Palestine declared a day of mourning and ordered flags to be flown at half-mast. India also declared a period of national mourning with flags at half-staff for one day starting from 14 May 2022. Bangladesh declared one day of state mourning on Saturday. Cuba declared one day of mourning on 17 May.

== Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Mosque ==
In honor of the Sheikh&#x27;s legacy, one of the largest mosques in the U.A.E. was built in the city of Al Ain and named after him. It was opened to the public on 12 April 2021.

<doc id="1129855" wikidata="Q267660" url="?curid=1129855" title="Gudula">
<text>Gudula of Brabant, also known as Saint Gudula (ca. 646–712), was a Christian saint who is venerated in Catholic and Orthodox churches. In Brabant, she is usually called &quot;Goedele&quot; or &quot;Goule&quot;; (, later &quot;&quot;; ; ). Her name is connected to several places: Moorsel (where she lived), Brussels (where a chapter in her honour was founded in 1047) and Eibingen (where the relic of her skull is conserved).

==Life==
Gudula was born around 646 in the pagus of Brabant (in present-day Belgium). According to her 11th-century biography (), written by Onulfus of Hautmont, a monk of Hautmont Abbey between 1048 and 1051, she was the daughter of a duke of Lotharingia called Witger and Saint Amalberga. Her mother embraced the religious life in Maubeuge Abbey. Gudula had three sisters, Saint Pharaildis, Saint Reineldis and Saint Ermelinde, and one brother, Saint Emebertus. She received the veil from the hands of Saint Aubert, Bishop of Cambrai (d. about 668).

Gudula was educated in Nivelles Abbey by her godmother, Gertrude of Nivelles. When Gertrude died, Gudula moved back to her home at Moorsel, spending her time in good works and religious devotion. She was profuse in her alms for the poor, and frequently visited the church of Moorsel, situated about two miles from her parents&#x27; house. Nothing particular is recorded of Gudula beyond the singular holiness of her life.

Gudula died between 680 and 714, with the most frequent date mentioned being 712, and was buried at Hamme (East Flanders). Later, her relics were removed to a St. Salvator near Moorsel, where the body was interred behind the altar. During the reign of Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine (977–992), they were transferred to Saint Gaugericus&#x27; chapel in Brussels. Lambert II, Count of Leuven, (d. 1054) founded a chapter in 1047 in honour of Saint Gudula. Bishop Gerardus I of Cambrai (d. 1051) led the translation of her relics to the church of Saint Michael in Brussels. The church later became the famous Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula.

On 6 June 1579, the collegiate church was pillaged and wrecked by Protestant &quot;Geuzen&quot; (&quot;Beggars&quot;), and Saint Gudula&#x27;s relics were disinterred and scattered.

==Veneration==
Along with Saint Michael, Gudula is a patron saint of Brussels. Her feast is generally celebrated on 8 January (the day she died according to her hagiography). However, in the diocese of Ghent (where Moorsel is situated), her feast is held on 19 January. Charlemagne also made donations to the convent of Moorsel in her honour.

Saint Gudula&#x27;s skull is conserved in the Catholic Church of St. Hildegard in Eibingen, Germany.

==Iconography==
Saint Gudula is often depicted holding a lantern or taper, but this originates probably out of confusion with the Paris Saint Genevieve tradition. She is depicted on a seal of the Church of St. Gudula of 1446 holding in her right hand a candle, and in her left a lamp, which a demon tries to extinguish. This refers to the legend that the saint went to church before cock-crow. The demon, wishing to stray her off the right way, extinguished the candle, but the saint obtained from God that her lantern should be rekindled.

The flower called &quot;tremella deliquescens&quot;, which bears fruit in the beginning of January, is known as &quot;Sinte Goedele&#x27;s lampken&quot; (St. Gudula&#x27;s lantern).

<text>Queen Alliquippa or Queen Aliquippa (died December 23, 1754) was a leader of the Seneca tribe of American Indians during the early part of the 18th century.

==Biography==
Little is known about Queen Aliquippa&#x27;s early life. Her date of birth has been estimated anywhere from the early 1670s to the early 18th century. By the 1740s, she was the leader of a band of Mingo Seneca living along the three rivers (the Ohio River, the Allegheny River, and the Monongahela River) near what is now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By 1753, she and her band were living at the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers near the present-day city of McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

George Washington wrote of his visit to Queen Aliquippa in December 1753 stating:

As we intended to take horse here [ at Frazer&#x27;s Cabin on the mouth of Turtle Creek ], and it required some time to find them, I went up about three miles to the mouth of the Youghiogheny to visit Queen Aliquippa, who had expressed great concern that we passed her in going to [ Fort Le Boeuf ]. I made her a present of a match-coat and a bottle of rum, which latter was thought much the better present of the two.

Queen Aliquippa was a key ally of the British leading up to the French and Indian War. She, her son Kanuksusy, and warriors from her band of Mingo Seneca traveled to Fort Necessity to assist George Washington, but did not take an active part in the Battle of the Great Meadows on July 3–4, 1754.

After the British defeat at the Battle of the Great Meadows and the evacuation of Fort Necessity, Queen Aliquippa moved her band to the Aughwick Valley of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania for safety. She died there on December 23, 1754.

==Legacy==
The city of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania was named in her honor by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. However, she herself had no connection to the land upon which the city was built.

She is mentioned by Tom Hanks&#x27;s character in one of the last scenes of &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, when discussing matters with Gust Avrakotos in a reference to his hometown of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania.

==Chronological notes==

In 1752, Conrad Weiser reported visiting Queen Aliquippa, at &quot;Aliquippa&#x27;s Town&quot; located on the Ohio at the mouth of Chartiers Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River near McKees Rocks and Pittsburgh. In January, 1754, George Washington, was sent by Virginia&#x27;s Lt. Governor Dinwiddie to ask the French to leave the Ohio region, and he met with Iroquois leaders at Logstown; whilst there, Washington failed to pay his respects to Queen Aliquippa. Washington arrived at the Great Meadows (Fort Necessity) 24 May 1754. A Virginia regiment arrived at the Great Meadows with Tanacharison (known as the &quot;Half King&quot;) on 9 June 1754. Battle of Fort Necessity occurred 3 July 1754. On the 4th of July, Washington surrendered to the French and accepted defeat. The British troops left Fort Necessity for Wills Creek on the morning of July 4, from there they marched back to Virginia. To understand the events of the day, a hearing conducted by Virginia&#x27;s Lt. Governor Dinwiddie was held. 

On August 27, 1754, a deposition was filed by a Captain John B. W. Shaw that stated the Native Americans, including Queen Aliquippa, loyal to the British were going to &quot;Jemmy Arther&quot; for protection. &quot;Jemmy Arther&quot; was Aughwick or George Croghan&#x27;s settlement, just north of the modern-day Shirleysburg. In a letter dated 16 August 1754, Croghan wrote to the governor of the province of Pennsylvania that Tanacharison and his fellow Mingo Seneca people had been staying with him at Aughwick since Washington&#x27;s defeat (Hazard 1897, 140-141). Conrad Weiser visited Croghan&#x27;s homestead at Aughwick on September 3, 1754 to investigate the situation and reported to Governor Hamilton. In Wiser&#x27;s report to the Governor he reported to the Governor that; &quot; ... he had encountered about twenty cabins about Croghan&#x27;s house, and in them at least 200 Indians, men, women and children ...&quot; (Hazard 1878, 149). 
On December 23, 1754, Queen Aliquippa died at Aughwick (Fort Shirley). Croghan&#x27;s blunt journal entry records her death, &quot;Alequeapy, ye old quine is dead.&quot;. Alliquippa, a Delaware village, was on the farm of William Hartley, Esq., on the east bank of the Raystown branch, near Mt. Dallas and the historic village of Bloody Run (Everett, Pennsylvania). Tradition says the village, a gap and a hill were all named after Queen Alliquippa, who lived there in her youth, and these names are so given on a map of the Province of 1770. A letter written from Alliquippa village on June 17, 1775, at the time some of the Provincial troops were there says: &quot;The Queen Alliquippa, upon the surrender of the unfinished fort at the Forks of the Ohio by Ensign Ward had returned to this place.&quot; From the expression &quot;had returned&quot; it is fair to infer that she formerly lived there and was subsequently buried there.

<text>Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (often abbreviated PJS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa (melanosis). This syndrome can be classed as one of various hereditary intestinal polyposis syndromes and one of various hamartomatous polyposis syndromes. It has an incidence of approximately 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 births.

==Signs and symptoms==
The risks associated with this syndrome include a substantial risk of cancer, especially of the breast and gastrointestinal tracts. Colorectal is the most common malignancy, with a lifetime risk of 39 percent, followed by breast cancer in females with a lifetime risk of 32 to 54 percent.

Patients with the syndrome also have an increased risk of developing carcinomas of the liver, lungs, breast, ovaries, uterus, testes, and other organs. Specifically, it is associated with an increased risk of sex-cord stromal tumor with annular tubules in the ovaries.

Due to the increased risk of malignancies, direct surveillance is recommended.
The average age of first diagnosis is 23. The first presentation is often bowel obstruction or intussuseption from the hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps. Dark blue, brown, and black pigmented mucocutaneous macules, are present in over 95 percent of individuals with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome. Pigmented lesions are rarely present at birth, but often appear before 5 years of age. The macules may fade during puberty. The melanocytic macules are not associated with malignant transformation.

Complications associated with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome include obstruction and intussusception, which occur in up to 69 percent of patients, typically first between the ages of 6 and 18, though surveillance for them is controversial. Anemia is also common due to gastrointestinal bleeding from the polyps.

==Genetics==
In 1998, a gene was found to be associated with the mutation. On chromosome 19, the gene known as &quot;STK11&quot; (&quot;LKB1&quot;) is a possible tumor suppressor gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that anyone who has PJS has a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their offspring.

Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is rare and studies typically include only a small number of patients. Even in those few studies that do contain a large number of patients, the quality of the evidence is limited due to pooling patients from many centers, selection bias (only patients with health problems coming from treatment are included), and historical bias (the patients reported are from a time before advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Peutz–Jeghers syndrome were made). Probably due to this limited evidence base, cancer risk estimates for Peutz–Jeghers syndrome vary from study to study. There is an estimated 18–21% risk of ovarian cancer, 9% risk of endometrial cancer, and 10% risk of cervical cancer, specifically adenoma malignum.

==Diagnosis==

The main criteria for clinical diagnosis are:
* Family history
* Mucocutaneous lesions causing patches of hyperpigmentation in the mouth and on the hands and feet. The oral pigmentations are the first on the body to appear, and thus play an important part in early diagnosis. Intraorally, they are most frequently seen on the gingiva, hard palate and inside of the cheek. The mucosa of the lower lip is almost invariably involved as well.
* Hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. These are benign polyps with an extraordinarily low potential for malignancy.

Having two of the three listed clinical criteria indicates a positive diagnosis. The oral findings are consistent with other conditions, such as Addison&#x27;s disease and McCune–Albright syndrome, and these should be included in the differential diagnosis. 90–100% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of PJS have a mutation in the &quot;STK11/LKB1&quot; gene. Molecular genetic testing for this mutation is available clinically.

==Management==
Resection of the polyps is required only if serious bleeding or intussusception occurs. Enterotomy is performed for removing large, single nodules. Short lengths of heavily involved intestinal segments can be resected. Colonoscopy can be used to snare the polyps if they are within reach.

==Prognosis==

Most patients will develop flat, brownish spots (melanotic macules) on the skin, especially on the lips and oral mucosa, during the first year of life, and a patient&#x27;s first bowel obstruction due to intussusception usually occurs between the ages of six and 18 years. The cumulative lifetime cancer risk begins to rise in middle age. Cumulative risks by age 70 for all cancers, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and pancreatic cancer are 85%, 57%, and 11%, respectively.

A 2011 Dutch study followed 133 patients for 14 years. The cumulative risk for cancer was 40% and 76% at ages 40 and 70, respectively. 42 (32%) of the patients died during the study, of which 28 (67%) were cancer related. They died at a median age of 45. Mortality was increased compared with the general population.

A family with sinonasal polyposis were followed up for 28 years. Two cases of sinonasal type adenocarcinoma developed. This is a rare cancer. This report suggested that follow up of sinus polyps in this syndrome may be indicated.

===Monitoring===

Some suggestions for surveillance for cancer include the following:
* Small intestine with small bowel radiography every two years,
* Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy every two years,
* CT scan or MRI of the pancreas yearly,
* Ultrasound of the pelvis and testes yearly
* Mammography from age 30 annually
* Papanicolaou smear (Pap smear) annually beginning at age 18–20

Follow-up care should be supervised by a physician familiar with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome. Genetic consultation and counseling as well as urological and gynecological consultations are often needed.

==Eponym==
First described in a published case report in 1921 by Jan Peutz (1886–1957), a Dutch Internist, it was later formalized into the syndrome by American physicians at Boston City Hospital, Harold Joseph Jeghers (1904–1990) and Kermit Harry Katz (1914–2003), and Victor Almon McKusick (1921–2008) in 1949 and published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;.

<text>Pauline Vanier, PC, CC, DStJ (&quot;née&quot; Archer; March 28, 1898 – March 23, 1991) was a Canadian humanitarian who was married to Georges Vanier. Her husband was one of Canada&#x27;s first professional diplomats, Canada&#x27;s first ambassador to France, and the first French-Canadian Governor General of Canada from 1959 until his death in 1967. She was the first woman Chancellor of the University of Ottawa as well as the first non-Roman Catholic Bishop to hold the role following the University&#x27;s reorganization into a public university.

==Life and career==
She was the daughter of Thérèse (&quot;née&quot; de Salaberry) and Charles Archer, a judge on the Quebec superior court. Her mother was a descendant of Charles de Salaberry, a military officer and statesman in Lower Canada. With her extensive diplomatic experience, Pauline filled the role of vice-regal consort with as much distinction as her husband filled his. Georges and Pauline Vanier created the Vanier Institute of the Family in 1965.

Madame Vanier was the first non-political woman to be appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. She was sworn in on April 11, 1967, as a sign of honour from Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. In July that same year, she was made one of the first Companions of the Order of Canada for her humanitarian work. She was appointed as Chancellor of the University of Ottawa in 1966.

The couple had five children. Their son Jean founded L&#x27;Arche, and their daughter Thérèse was a medical doctor who specialized in haematology and palliative care. 

==Legacy==

A Catholic elementary school in Brampton, Ontario, is named in her honor, as well as an Ottawa middle school. Madame Vanier Hall, a women&#x27;s residence at St. Thomas University in Fredericton, New Brunswick, also bears her name. In 1963, London Children&#x27;s Aid and Catholic Social Services groups got together and created the &quot;Madame Vanier Children&#x27;s Services&quot;. Pauline Vanier Park in Ottawa is named in her honour.

<doc id="1129876" wikidata="Q951562" url="?curid=1129876" title="Ghost Hunters (TV series)">
<text>Ghost Hunters is an American paranormal and reality television series. The original series aired from October 6, 2004 until October 26, 2016 on Syfy. The original program spanned eleven seasons with 230 episodes, not including 10 specials. The series was revived in early 2019 and aired its twelfth and thirteenth seasons from August 21, 2019, to May 27, 2020, on A&amp;E, after which it was cancelled and then revived for its fourteenth season only months later on Discovery+, which started airing on October 31, 2021. Season 15 began October 1, 2022 on Travel Channel. Season 16 of Ghost Hunters is set to release on Travel Channel on April 6, 2023.

The program featured Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, who founded The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS) team of paranormal investigators to investigate places that are reported to be haunted. The two worked as plumbers for Roto-Rooter while moonlighting as paranormal investigators at night. For the 12th and 13th seasons, the revived show featured Wilson and a new investigatory team that had no discernible connection to TAPS, although the series still maintained the same format and producers and referenced past episodes. For the fourteenth season, Hawes and the previous TAPS incarnation from 2016 returned, while Wilson and the new team were not featured.

The series, initially produced for 10 episodes as a docu-soap, had later episodes shift to a more documentary focus. &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; episodes feature the team going to reportedly haunted locations across the United States, with some investigations in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Canada in earlier seasons. The latter concept led to the show&#x27;s first spin-off, &quot;Ghost Hunters International&quot;, in 2008, which often featured &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; investigators in lead and guest roles, including Hawes and Wilson. A second spin-off, &quot;Ghost Hunters Academy&quot; (2009–10), had TAPS members Dave Tango and Steve Gonsalves training prospective investigators in a competitive format. Additionally, annual Halloween specials were broadcast live from 2005 to 2011 and featured celebrity guests and interactivity.

The series popularized paranormal reality television and ghost hunting, and some members of the show have moved on to feature in their own television programs.

== Premise ==
Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, along with other team members who belong to the group they founded, The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS), investigate locations of interest by using various electronic equipment, which they believe is capable of detecting paranormal activity. The two originally worked as plumbers for Roto-Rooter as a day job while investigating locations at night.

=== Investigative procedures ===

When investigating a location, TAPS team members first visit and survey the property with its owners, who describe their experiences at the site. Next, the team sets up electronic equipment in the apparent paranormal hotspots. The TAPS team then spends several hours taking electromagnetic field and temperature readings, recording audio for EVPs, and filming with digital video cameras. Many times, they will even try to verbally coax the ghosts into responding, while recording. Afterwards, the team spends several days analyzing all of the data for evidence of possible paranormal activity.

A few days after reviewing the information, Hawes and Wilson discuss their findings with the location site owners, offer suggestions for dealing with any apparent activity, and answer any questions the owners may have.

The TAPS members state that they do not believe that every phenomenon captured is evidence of the paranormal and sometimes provide reasonable explanations such as cold spots which may be drafty windows, strange noises that may be a thumping branch or vermin in the walls, moving objects which may have been accidentally bumped or tugged, or phantom lights which can be reflections of light from a passing vehicle.

Since the series began airing, TAPS has recorded thousands of hours of audio and video data. Most investigations, according to TAPS, turn up cold with very little, if any, paranormal activity occurring; however, the ghost hunters claim to have several decent recordings of moving objects, mysterious lights, strange mists, and shadowy figures that manifest before the camera and are highlighted at the end of the show.

Sci Fi initially categorized the program as a docu-soap. In addition to the investigative aspect, the show has also presented personal conflicts and relationships among members of the TAPS team. Portions of some episodes portray Hawes and Wilson involved with their plumbing job or personal lives, but this varies by episode and is not always included. As the series progressed, however, the &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; and &quot;docu-soap&quot; aspects were reduced, and by the fifth season the show focused primarily on the investigations, with virtually none of the docu-soap material that characterized earlier episodes.

=== Equipment used ===
During investigations, the TAPS ghost hunters team use various equipment, including digital thermometers, EMF meters, thermographic and night vision cameras, handheld and static digital video cameras, digital audio recorders, and laptop computers.

The team has also experimented, in at least one episode, with a geiger counter during their investigation to see if it would register any anomalous readings.

Starting around the third season, the team has used the K-2 (or K-II) meter, a type of EMF meter that uses a series of LEDs to measure the strength of an energy field instead of a numerical LCD screen. During the Manson murders investigation, in particular, the team used a K-2 meter in an attempt to get &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; responses to verbal questions posed to a supposed entity in a room.

In the fifth season&#x27;s &quot;Edith Wharton Estate&quot; case, the team introduced two new pieces of equipment: one is a custom-made geophone, which detects vibrations and flashes a series of LEDs that measure the intensity of the vibration; the second is a new EMF detector that makes a buzzing sound when in the presence of an electromagnetic field, and the stronger the field, the louder it buzzes. In the episode, the geophones were recorded on video flashing to the vibrations of what sounded like footsteps across a floor, even though no one was supposedly in the room.

Other gear not typically shown on screen are an ion generator, a device that charges the air with electricity and is theorized to help spirits manifest, and the white noise generator, an audio device that makes a static background noise and is theorized to act as a catalyst for assisting entities in making EVPs.

== Production ==
On March 3, 2010, &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;&#x27; 100th episode aired, featuring their investigation of Alcatraz Prison. The two-hour special featured a live studio audience with question and answer segments, hosted by Josh Gates of &quot;Destination Truth&quot;. The special also featured the &quot;GHI&quot; crew, the winning contestants of &quot;Ghost Hunters Academy&quot;, and Craig Piligian, the creator and executive producer of &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;. On June 2, 2011, Syfy renewed &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; for an eighth season, marking it as the longest-running reality series to air on the network.

On February 15, 2012, Grant Wilson announced he would be leaving the cast of &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; in order to focus on his personal life. In a statement, Hawes responded with, &quot;I will miss working with Grant on a daily basis, and am indebted to the level of dedication and expertise he has brought to our field. I can’t imagine having a better partner through it all — both on the show and off. Grant and I, along with our spouses and children, are all like one big family. While I fully support his decision to move on from the series, this longtime friendship — as well as our business partnership — will continue off-camera for years to come.&quot; Subsequently, Wilson also left the &quot;Beyond Reality&quot; radio show and was eventually replaced by JV Johnson, the publisher/editor of TAPS Para-magazine.

On June 7, 2016, Hawes announced that &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; would be concluding on Syfy, with season 11 being the last season to be produced. On August 1, Wilson publicly reunited with Hawes for the first time, as a guest on &quot;Beyond Reality&quot;.

On June 26, 2019, it was announced that &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; would be revived later that year, with Wilson returning with a new team. The 12th season, initially reported to consist of 20 episodes (later broadcast as 11 with two specials, with a 13th season premiering later), premiered on August 21, 2019 on A&amp;E and ended on October 30, 2019. Lead investigator and producer Grant Wilson confirmed prior to the October 30, 2019 episode that &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; would return in 2020 for a 13th season of an unspecified number of episodes. On February 18, 2020, it was announced that the 13th season would premiere on April 8, 2020. Brandon Alvis confirmed on October 17, 2020, that the show would not be returning on A&amp;E.

On May 18, 2021 it was announced that &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; was sold to Discovery+, and once again revived for its fourteenth season. Wilson and the new team were not featured, instead Hawes, Gonsalves, Tango, and DeBenedetti, who featured as the last cast of the original run of the show (and at the time of the purchase, the cast of &quot;Ghost Nation&quot;) returned using the &quot;TAPS&quot; moniker and methods featured previously. It airs on Discovery+ as season 14 of &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;, but uses &quot;TAPS Returns&quot; as a subtitle in marketing. Seasons 1–11, as well as seasons 12 and 13, which aired on A&amp;E, are now subtitled &quot;Ghost Hunters (Classic)&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; has garnered some of the highest ratings of any Syfy reality programming. From the start, the show has found an audience for its mix of paranormal investigation and interpersonal drama. It has since been syndicated on NBC Universal sister cable channel Oxygen and also airs on the Canadian cable network OLN.

In the early shows, TAPS was headquartered in a trailer located behind Jason Hawes&#x27; house, and they drove one white van to investigations. Within one season, they had moved the operation to a storefront in Warwick, Rhode Island, and acquired several new TAPS vehicles.

In addition to their successful television venture, TAPS operates a website where they share their stories, photographs, and ghost hunting videos with an ever-growing membership list. Because of the popularity of the show, TAPS cast members have signed contracts with at least two talent agencies, Escape Artistry and GP Entertainment, to manage their appearances at lectures, conferences and public events.

TAPS also has a three-hour weekly radio show called &quot;Beyond Reality&quot;, initially hosted by Hawes and Wilson. The radio show covers topics in a vast array of areas such as cryptozoology, spiritualism, ufology, and ghosts. The show includes guest appearances from other TAPS members and special guests such as John Zaffis, Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Chris Fleming, and others who specialize in certain fields. Noted paranormal author Jeff Belanger and &quot;Spooky Southcoast&quot; radio host and author Tim Weisberg served as fill-in hosts. The show also once simulcasted on &quot;Spooky Southcoast&quot;, airing from the Mt. Washington Hotel in New Hampshire. New episodes are broadcast every Saturday from 7 pm to 10 pm Eastern Time, though sometimes may skip a week due to the possibility of the hosts being busy with other ventures.

=== Popular culture ===
&quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; helped popularize paranormal television and ghost hunting during its original run. For much of its initial airing on Syfy, it was the top-rated paranormal reality show on television. John Blake of CNN opined in 2013 that &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; &quot;is to the paranormal field what Sugarhill&#x27;s &#x27;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&#x27; is to hip-hop...&quot;

Hawes, Wilson and &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; were parodied on the 2009 episode of &quot;South Park&quot; entitled &quot;Dead Celebrities&quot;. They have made talk-show appearances on the December 8, 2005 episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, the Oct 31, 2006 episode of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, a 2008 episode of &quot;The View&quot;, and the October 28, 2010 episode of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

=== Criticism ===
&quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; has attracted various critics and skeptics, such as Joe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; author Lynne Kelly, James Randi, and Benjamin Radford. The Skeptical Analysis of the Paranormal Society (SAPS) was founded with the intent to recreate and debunk segments of the show.

In June 2008, &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; was awarded The Truly Terrible Television (TTTV) Award by Independent Investigations Group for peddling pseudoscience and superstition to its audience.

During the seven-hour-long, live Halloween show on October 31, 2008, at least two events took place that critics have scrutinized: One occurs when lead investigator Grant Wilson has his jacket collar pulled down by an unseen force three times; all the while one of his hands remained at his side, which led detractors to claim he was pulling a hidden string. This happens again at one point where Hawes touches Wilson&#x27;s back and his collar moves down again. Another occurs when a supposed disembodied voice tells the hunters, &quot;You&#x27;re not supposed to be here.&quot; Critics have claimed the voice sounded like it was piped in from an external audio source. In regard to the scrutiny, Wilson and Hawes defended themselves, stating that everything in the show is real. In a 2013 interview on &quot;The Reveal&quot;, Wilson stated that their television contracts forbade them from faking evidence on the show.

According to investigator Benjamin Radford, most ghost hunting groups including TAPS make many methodological mistakes. &quot;After watching episodes of &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; and other similar programs, it quickly becomes clear to anyone with a background in science that the methods used are both illogical and unscientific&quot;. Anyone can be a ghost investigator, &quot;failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena&quot;, considering emotions and feelings as &quot;evidence of ghostly encounters.&quot; &quot;Improper and unscientific investigation methods&quot;, for example, &quot;using unproven tools and equipment&quot;, &quot;sampling errors&quot;, &quot;ineffectively using recording devices&quot; and &quot;focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena.&quot; In an article for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation: &quot;I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously. Most of the efforts to investigate ghosts so far have been badly flawed and unscientific — and not surprisingly, fruitless.&quot; In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; and TAPS, Radford contended that &quot;the group and others like it lack scientific rigor and mislead people into thinking that their homes are haunted.&quot;

The show&#x27;s editing has been questioned, such as activity that is not captured on tape and findings that are unsupported by evidence in the show specifically. Tools are used in ways that are not proven effective, or in ways in which they have been proven ineffective, such as infrared thermometers that are claimed to detect cold spots in the middle of rooms when such tools are able only to measure the surface temperature of objects.

Techniques with thermal imaging cameras, Geiger counters, electronic voice phenomenon, and EMF detectors are used with little or no explanation as to how the techniques have proven to provide evidence of ghosts or other entities. There are concerns that the devices are misused, such as the noting of Benjamin Radford&#x27;s article for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;: &quot;you may own the world&#x27;s most sophisticated thermometer, but if you are using it as a barometer, your measurements are worthless. Just as using a calculator doesn&#x27;t make you a mathematician, using a scientific instrument doesn&#x27;t make you a scientist.&quot;

=== Spin-offs ===
==== &quot;Ghost Hunters International&quot; ====

A spin-off series premiered on January 9, 2008, featuring investigators Robb Demarest, Brian Harnois, Donna LaCroix, Andy Andrews, Shannon Sylvia, and Barry Fitzgerald (who appeared in the summer 2007 Ireland episodes of &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;) since the onset, along with other rotating members from the TAPS family. The format is similar to &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; but features investigations in various locations around the world.

==== &quot;UFO Hunters&quot; ====
&quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; producers Craig Pilligan and Tom Thayer released another paranormal investigation &quot;special&quot; titled &quot;UFO Hunters&quot;, (not to be confused with the show of the same name which aired on the History Channel), which first aired on January 30, 2008 but only aired for one episode. The episode followed New York Strange Phenomena Investigators (NY-SPI) co-founders Oliver Kemenczky and Ted Davis, along with paranormal researcher Dennis Anderson, as they investigated an alleged alien abduction case in Carteret, New Jersey and a strange fireball sighting in Normandy Beach, New Jersey. The format was similar to a typical &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; episode, with most of the program dedicated to the investigation and wrapped up with a review of findings and evidence that was gathered. The pilot episode was reformatted and returned on December 13, 2008, as a special called &quot;Ny-Spi Investigates&quot; on Investigation Discovery, but was not picked up as a continuing series.

==== &quot;Ghost Hunters Academy&quot; ====

On October 23, 2008, &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that Syfy would launch a spin-off of the show called &quot;Ghost Hunters: College Edition&quot;, which would feature &quot;co-eds&quot; in the ghost hunter roles. The show was later named &quot;Ghost Hunters Academy&quot; and began airing November 11, 2009. The series features Steve Gonsalves and Dave Tango leading a group of amateur ghost hunters through various investigations.

=== Later series ===
==== &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot; ====

TAPS members Adam Berry (also the finalist from &quot;Ghost Hunters Academy&quot;) and Amy Bruni left the series in 2014 to start their own program, which was subsequently named &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot;, which started airing on Destination America and TLC in 2013 and has aired 6 seasons so far, later moving to Travel Channel.

==== &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; ====

After the decision to cut ties with Syfy in 2016 and negotiations to start a new &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; series failed, Hawes, Gonsalves, and Tango eventually came to decide to focus on efforts to help local investigators on a national level and start a new program, &quot;Ghost Nation&quot;. The program has aired on Travel Channel since October 2019.

==== &quot;Haunted Discoveries&quot; ====

In 2022, Brandon Alvis and Mustafa Gatollari announced that their new paranormal documentary series &quot;Haunted Discoveries&quot; was in full production and that their new series promises to &quot;push the field forward.&quot; In October 2023, &quot;Haunted Discoveries&quot; debuted on the T+E network in Canada. The new series &quot;tracks the adventures of a team of paranormal investigators on the trail of anomalies in Kentucky, long considered America&#x27;s most haunted state.&quot;

<doc id="1129884" wikidata="Q1156395" url="?curid=1129884" title="Peter Lynch">
<text>Peter Lynch (born January 19, 1944) is an American investor, mutual fund manager, author and philanthropist. As the manager of the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments between 1977 and 1990, Lynch averaged a 29.2% annual return, consistently more than double the S&amp;P 500 stock market index and making it the best-performing mutual fund in the world. During his 13-year tenure, assets under management increased from US$18 million to $14 billion.

A proponent of value investing, Lynch wrote and co-authored a number of books and papers on investing strategies, including &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot;, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1989, which sold over one million copies. He coined a number of well-known mantras of modern individual investing, such as &quot;&quot;invest in what you know&quot; and &quot;ten bagger&quot;&quot;. Lynch has been described as a &quot;legend&quot; by the financial media for his performance record.

==Early life and education==
Peter Lynch was born on January 19, 1944, in Newton, Massachusetts. In 1951, when Lynch was seven, his father was diagnosed with brain cancer. He died three years later, and Lynch&#x27;s mother had to work to support the family. Lynch reports that from his early teens he worked as a caddie to help support the family. During Lynch&#x27;s time as a sophomore at Boston College, he used his savings to buy 100 shares of Flying Tiger Airlines at $7 per share. The stock would later rise to $80 per share, profits from which helped pay for his education.

In 1965, Lynch graduated from Boston College where he studied history, psychology, and philosophy. He later earned a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968.

==Investment career==
===Fidelity===
In 1966, Lynch was hired as an intern with Fidelity Investments partly because he had been caddying for Fidelity&#x27;s president, D. George Sullivan, (among others) at Brae Burn Country Club in Newton, Massachusetts. He initially covered the paper, chemical, and publishing industries, and when he returned after a two-year Army stint he was hired permanently in 1969. This time Lynch was charged with following the textiles, metals, mining, and chemicals industries, eventually becoming Fidelity&#x27;s director of research from 1974 to 1977.

====Fidelity Magellan Fund====
In 1977, Lynch was named head of the then-obscure Magellan Fund which had $18 million in assets. By the time Lynch resigned as a fund manager in 1990, the fund had grown to more than $14 billion in assets with more than 1,000 individual stock positions. From 1977 until 1990, the Magellan fund averaged a 29.2% annual return and as of 2003 had the best 20-year return of any mutual fund ever, as of 2017.

Taking over when Magellan was a small fund, Lynch had no restrictions imposed by Fidelity on what types of stocks he could buy, and was only limited by laws or regulations. He focused on individual companies he thought were good investments rather than any overarching strategy, starting with large US companies and gradually shifting his emphasis to smaller and international stocks. Lynch found successes in a broad range of stocks from different industries. According to &quot;Beating the Street&quot; his most profitable picks while running the Magellan fund were Fannie Mae ($500 million), Ford ($199 million), Philip Morris ($111 million), MCI ($92 million), Volvo ($79 million), General Electric ($76 million), General Public Utilities ($69 million), Student Loan Marketing ($65 million), Kemper ($63 million), and Lowe&#x27;s ($54 million).

==Investment philosophy==
Lynch has written (with co-author John Rothchild) three texts on investing: &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot; (), &quot;Beating the Street&quot; (), and &quot;Learn to Earn&quot;. The last-named book was written for beginning investors of all ages, mainly teenagers. In essence, &quot;One Up&quot; served as theory while &quot;Beating the Street&quot; is application. &quot;One Up&quot; lays out Lynch&#x27;s investment technique including chapters devoted to stock classifications, the two-minute drill, famous numbers, and designing a portfolio. Most of &quot;Beating the Street&quot; consists of an extensive stock by stock discussion of Lynch&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Barron&#x27;s Magazine&quot; selections, essentially providing an illustration of the concepts previously discussed. As such, both books represent study material for investors of any knowledge level or ability.

Lynch also wrote a series of investment articles for &quot;Worth&quot; magazine that expand on many of the concepts and companies mentioned in the books.Lynch coined some of the best-known mantras of modern individual investing strategies.

His most famous investment principle is, &quot;invest in what you know,&quot; popularizing the economic concept of &quot;local knowledge&quot;. Since most people tend to become expert in certain fields, applying this basic &quot;invest in what you know&quot; principle helps individual investors find good undervalued stocks. Lynch uses this principle as a starting point for investors. He has also often said that the individual investor is potentially more capable of making money from stocks than a fund manager, because they are able to spot good investments in their day-to-day lives before Wall Street. Throughout his two classic investment primers, he has outlined many of the investments he found when not in his office. For example, in &quot;One Up&quot; Lynch explains how he invested in Dunkin&#x27; Donuts not after reading about the company in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, but after being impressed by their coffee as a customer. Assuming others would be similarly impressed and noting the company&#x27;s Boston locations were always busy, he then studied the company&#x27;s financial status and decided to invest in Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, which proved one of the best-performing stocks he ever bought. Lynch believes the individual investor is able to make similar smart investing choices noticing particular opportunities like Dunkin&#x27; Donuts or paying attention to business trends in their careers and hobbies. Using examples from Magellan Fund, his books outline how a novice should read and interpret company paperwork for information on stock valuation, earnings, cash flow, and other data.

Lynch has stated in &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot; that his undergraduate studies in philosophy and logic were more important to his career than the math or finance he studied for his MBA. At Wharton, he came to believe that the two prevailing investing theories in academia, the random walk hypothesis and the efficient market hypothesis, were contradictory. The concepts taught by professors at school were regularly disproved by professionals during his internship at Fidelity. He thus came to rely more on practitioners than theoreticians: &quot;It seemed to me that what was supposed to help you succeed in the investment business, could only help you fail ... Quantitative analysis taught me that the things I saw happening at Fidelity couldn&#x27;t really be happening.&quot;

Lynch has also argued against market timing, stating: &quot;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in the corrections themselves.&quot;

Lynch popularized the stock investment strategy “GARP” (Growth At A Reasonable Price), which is a hybrid stock-picking approach that balances Growth investing potential for share-price increases with the discipline of Value investing to avoid buying overpriced stocks. Many well-known funds now follow the GARP model, ranging from equity funds such as Fidelity Investments Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Lemma Senbet Fund, to index funds such as Russell Indexes iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index.

He also coined the phrase &quot;ten bagger&quot; in a financial context. This refers to an investment which is worth ten times its original purchase price, and comes from baseball where the number of &quot;bags&quot; or &quot;bases&quot; that a batter can run to is a measure of the success of that runner&#x27;s hit. A baseball player who hits a home run will pass all four bases, and so such a hit is sometimes called a four-bagger. Similarly, a baseball double hit is sometimes called a two bagger. As Lynch wrote in &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot;, “In my business a fourbagger is nice, but a tenbagger is the fiscal equivalent of two home runs and a double.” In &quot;Beating the Street&quot;, Lynch expounded with many-bagger, &quot;For the most part, the NAIC (National Association of Investors Corp) groups buy stocks in well-managed growth companies with a history of prosperity, and in which earnings are on the rise. This is the land of the many-bagger, where it’s not unusual to make 10, 20, or even 30 times your original investment in a decade.

==Personal life==
Lynch married Carolyn Ann Hoff and cofounded the Lynch Foundation. They had three daughters. His wife died in October 2015 due to complications of leukemia at age 69.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
In 2006, &quot;Boston Magazine&quot; named Lynch in the top 50 wealthiest Bostonians ranking him 40th with an overall net worth of $352 million USD.

Though he continues to work part time as vice chairman of Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co., the investment adviser arm of Fidelity Investments, spending most of his time mentoring young analysts, Peter Lynch focuses a great deal of time on philanthropy. He said he views philanthropy as a form of investment. He said he prefers to give money to support ideas that he thinks can spread, such as First Night, the New Year&#x27;s Eve festival that began in Boston in 1976 and has inspired similar events in more than 200 other communities, and City Year, a community service program founded in Boston in 1988 that now operates in 29 cities across the U.S.

The Lynches give money primarily in five ways: as individuals, through the Lynch Foundation, through a Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, and through two charitable trusts.

The Lynches have made gifts as individuals, donating $10 million to Peter Lynch&#x27;s alma mater, Boston College. In turn, BC named the Lynch School of Education and Human Development after the family.

The Lynch Foundation, valued at $125 million, gave away $8 million in 2013 and has made $80 million in grants since its inception. The Foundation supports education, religious organizations, cultural and historic organizations, and hospitals and medical research. For example, the Foundation donated $20 million to establish in 2010 the Lynch Leadership Academy (LLA), a research and training program for school principals at BC&#x27;s Carroll School of Management business school. The Lynch Foundation was one of the first major supporters of Teach for America, AmeriCares, and Partners in Health. Lynch was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1991.

Lynch is a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows.

== Honors ==
Lynch received the 1992 Seton Award from the National Catholic Education Association.

<doc id="1129890" wikidata="Q5604416" url="?curid=1129890" title="Greens/Green Party USA">
<text>The Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA) was a political organization formed out of the Green Committees of Correspondence in 1991 and was recognized as a national political party by the FEC from 1991 to 2005. It was based in Chicago. &quot;Synthesis/Regeneration&quot;, an affiliated journal of green social thought, was published in St. Louis. The now predominant Green Party of the United States split from the G/GPUSA in 2001.

==History==
The Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA) was founded at the August 1991 Green Gathering in Elkins, West Virginia, restructuring the Green Committees of Correspondence with the idea that the Green movement and Green Party would operate as part of a single organization.

A press conference was held in Washington, D.C., to announce the new organization, featuring Charles Betz (G/GPUSA Coordinating Committee member), Howie Hawkins and Joni Whitmore (Chair, Green Party of Alaska), as well as Hilda Mason of the D.C. Statehood Party, and was featured on C-SPAN. Subsequently, legal documents were filed under Missouri law to form the Greens/Green Party USA as a 527 group. It was recognized by the FEC as a national political party in 1991.

Subsequent G/GPUSA Green Gatherings were held in Minneapolis (Augsburg College, July 1992); Syracuse (August 1993); Boise (July 1994), Albuquerque (University of New Mexico, July 27–30, 1995), Los Angeles (UCLA, August 1996); and Lawrence, Massachusetts (August 1997).

At various times, a &quot;Green Clearinghouse&quot; was the central administrative office of G/GPUSA. The Clearinghouse has operated from various locations, including (originally) Kansas City, Missouri; Blodgett Mills, New York; Lawrence, Massachusetts; and Chicago.

Despite its development of a national-level organization, the G/GPUSA always emphasized that the &quot;Green Local&quot; is the primary organizing unit. Some members of G/GPUSA resisted efforts to organize Green parties at the state level, on the theory that state bureaucracy was inimical to the organic and democratic nature of autonomous Green locals. The model in the early days was based on the bioregion and not state boundaries. Other Greens pointed out that, in most jurisdictions in the United States, political parties gain recognition at the state level, so without state-level organizations it would be difficult for Greens to participate in election activities.

At the 2001 Congress of the G/GPUSA, held at Carbondale, Illinois, on July 21, the delegates were to consider the Boston Proposal, a separation of powers agreement between it and the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP). Many of those attending were also members of the ASGP. There was an intense organizational struggle, much of which revolved around whether or not to &quot;accredit&quot; various delegations (and thus grant them voting privileges). The proposal failed to reach the required two-thirds majority, although over half voted to approve it (99 in favor, 81 against).

The result was very controversial, and ultimately led to the exodus of many G/GPUSA activists, some of whom went on to form The Green Alliance, an organization intended to bring &quot;movement&quot; politics in the style of the G/GPUSA into the Green Party of the United States.

In 2001, the Green Party of the United States was founded and recognized by the FEC as a national committee, and has become a much larger and more visible than the G/GPUSA. In 2005, G/GPUSA lost its political party status at the FEC. It had reported no income or expenditures for some time.

The G/GPUSA Coordinating Committee notified its members and supporters of the decision to disband the party in January 2019.

==Contrast with the Green Party of the United States==
The Green Party of the United States and Greens/Green Party USA had no organizational connection but share a common and difficult history. The G/GPUSA is not an electoral party, although some of its members participate in elections. The name &quot;G/GPUSA&quot; is said to have reflected a compromise or a synergy between Greens who emphasized the primacy of combining non-electoral movement building with electoral campaigns, and those who sought to participate actively only in elections. It has also been characterized as a power grab when the original Committees of Correspondence split and a small group registered the name without consultation with the five existing state parties, all in the western states.

The Greens/Green Party USA was an educational, grassroots organizing, advocacy group based on the 10 Key Values. The journal &quot;Synthesis/Regeneration&quot; published in St. Louis, was associated with the G/GPUSA. This journal publishes articles by writers with a wide range of Green viewpoints. &quot;Synthesis/Regeneration&quot; was first published in 1991 and is produced every four months.

The source of the rift between the two national Green parties was a matter of contentious debate. Some point to differences of political philosophy or views on the proper structure of the party or attitudes toward elections, while others suggest it was more about personality conflicts, turf struggles, and poor communication leading to concerns about financial and political accountability, or perhaps the 1991 name grab or the inaccurate G/GPUSA FEC filing in 1995. It is important to note that the heated debates and the fighting that was waged for several years at the national level (and among Greens within a few states, such as New York, Missouri, California and New Jersey) seemed largely irrelevant to the vast majority of grassroots Greens, who preferred to devote their energies to local organizing.

In an article on the G/GPUSA&#x27;s website, the organization characterized the split between itself and the Green Party of the United States (GPUS) as akin to the fundi–realo split in the German Greens, with itself being the fundi wing and GPUS the realos.

<doc id="1129891" wikidata="Q2295404" url="?curid=1129891" title="Brujas F.C.">
<text>Brujas F.C. was a Costa Rican football club, based in Desamparados, Costa Rica.

The name Brujas translates to &quot;Witches&quot;. The team&#x27;s home town used to be Escazú, known around the country as &quot;La ciudad de las Brujas&quot; or &quot;The Witches&#x27; Town&quot;, but the franchise later transferred to Desamparados. The team was dissolved in July 2011.

==History==
===A.D. Guanacasteca===
The club was founded in 2004 as &quot;Brujas de Escazú&quot; when they took over the &quot;Asociación Deportiva Guanacasteca&quot; (&quot;A.D. Guanacasteca&quot; or ADG) licence to play in the Primera División de Costa Rica. Guanacasteca, known as &quot;Los Pamperos&quot;, were founded on 3 March 1973 as &quot;Nicoya F.C.&quot; but were renamed when they made their debut in the second division in 1974; they were once more renamed &quot;Sociedad Deportiva Guanacasteca&quot; in 2001. Guanacasteca were crowned Second Division champions 4 times, in 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2002.&lt;br&gt;In 2005, ADG was reestablished after buying Ciudad Colón&#x27;s second division franchise.

===Brujas de Escazú===
The newly founded team was subsequently moved from Nicoya, where they played at the Estadio Chorotega, in Guanacaste to Escazú in an attempt to get more support from fans. Club president Percy Chamberlain kept Uruguayan manager Hernán Fernando Sosa, who had taken Guanacasteca to 4th place in the previous season, at the helm but he was eventually dismissed in September 2004 and replaced by compatriot Carlos Blanco on an interim basis and later Manuel Keosseián. By June 2005, the team had signed one of the best coaches from the 2004 tournament, Colombian coach Carlos Restrepo and they played in the National Stadium of Costa Rica. In September 2005, Chamberlain was replaced as president of the club by former Saprissa president Mínor Vargas and Restrepo was released from his managerial duties in May 2007 and club president Mínor Vargas replaced him with Mauricio Wright, who was a member of Costa Rica&#x27;s 2002 World Cup national team.

===Brujas F.C.===
In summer 2007, the club moved again to play at the Estadio Jorge &quot;Cuty&quot; Monge in Desamparados and were renamed Brujas F.C. In December 2009 Brujas won the Invierno 2009 championship after beating Puntarenas in the final, which was the first to be decided on penalties in 38 years.

Wright was replaced by Luis Torres in May 2010 and in November 2010 club president Vargas resigned after it was claimed his company &quot;Grupo Ícono&quot; not only owned Brujas but also the then recently from the premier division expelled Barrio México. Vargas was arrested in the United States for alleged fraud with the PCI company in January 2011 and was found guilty to seven counts of fraud and three counts of money laundering in April 2012 and sentenced to 60 years in prison in October 2012.

In April 2011 the club&#x27;s franchise was transferred to Orión, who continued to play at the Cuty Monge stadium, and acquired by Spaniard Juan Luis Hernández Fuertes. Hernández was later acquitted of charges pressed by the Vargas family over bad checks.

The club&#x27;s supporters were known for using the now infamous phrase, &quot;Menores de lo que pensábamos&quot; (Smaller than we thought) as their official motto.

=== History ===

In a long-awaited match for the Costa Rican soccer fans, because after the 1964 campaign in which the Carmen FC team defeated Club Sport Uruguay de Coronado, there have been no finals without one of the 3 biggest in this league, Liga Deportiva Alajuelense, Club Sport Herediano and Deportivo Saprissa. The match began at 7:05 p.m. with an excited Buenos Aires team that went happily to the front but to no avail, because the first actions of real danger occurred until approximately 25 minutes later, and until 37 minutes when Luis Lara beat the defense but the ball crashed into the vertical. In the second half the &quot;shark&quot; team got tired of wasting goals and the &quot;sorcerers&quot; went all out on the attack but there were no goals, the first leg final was very lackluster especially because Brujas FC was not the overwhelming team that it was before the Municipal Pérez Zeledon and Liberia Mía, everything is defined on Monday, December 28, 2009, at 2:00 p.m.

The return leg was played at the Jorge Hernán &quot;Cuty&quot; Monge Stadium in a hotly contested game that welcomed 5,500 people seated even in the yellow zones and perhaps a little more fans, and at least 150 more than They stayed outside the stadium. The game was played too much in the first few minutes, so much so that Puntarenas FC took the lead in the 13th minute through Luis Lara, in a first half that did not leave much to talk about.

In the second half at minute 46&#x27; Daniel &quot;naughty&quot; Jiménez tied the game in a dressing room goal and would leave it that way until the end. The team from Desamparadeño won on penalties 5–4 with the failure of Josimar Arias for Brujas FC and Mario Viquez together with Bryan Zamora for Puntarenas FC. With this Brujas FC earned their first star on their shield, in other words their first national title.

<text>Percifer Carr (also given variously as &quot;Parsifer&quot;, &quot;Persifor&quot;, &quot;Persefer&quot; and &quot;Persafor&quot; Carr) (died 1804) was a British allied Loyalist living in what is now Otsego County, New York around the time of the American Revolution.

Carr served as a Sergeant with Colonel William Edmeston in the French and Indian War and was later employed as an agent for Edmeston and his brother Robert in establishing claims on tracts of land on the eastern bank of the Unadilla River just west of George Croghan&#x27;s Otsego patent near what is now the hamlet of South Edmeston in the Town of Edmeston. Carr was then made caretaker for these tracts, which became known as &quot;Mount Edmeston&quot; (also known as &quot;Edmeston Plantation&quot;, &quot;Edmeston Manor&quot;, &quot;Carr&#x27;s Garden&quot;, and commonly &quot;the Carr farm&quot;). The Edmeston brothers returned to England, but sent a number of settlers, likely including some Irish indentured servants, back to their estate. In 1773, William returned to Mount Edmeston to personally supervise its development, and by 1775, its population was nearing 100.

With the advent of the Revolutionary War, Edmeston, now a British Major, was detained by American patriots in the eastern part of the state and Carr continued to manage Mount Edmeston. But, as a known Tory, he was suspected by patriots at Cherry Valley and German Flatts of selling provisions to Joseph Brant. In September 1778, a group of Native Americans who were allied with the British, mistakenly set Carr&#x27;s house on fire and carried him and his wife to Canada through the Niagara region. At least one account has stated that Carr was treated very poorly, having been forced to lie down in steams to allow his captors to use his body as a footbridge.

Carr and his wife returned to Mount Edmeston in 1783. Major Edmeston who had returned to duty in Europe, hired Carr to rebuild his estate, but in 1788, Robert Edmeston returned to America and fired Carr. John Tunnicliff, an influential farmer in the area, tried to mediate the dispute, but, as Tunnicliff reported in a letter to William Cooper, his efforts proved fruitless, even though Carr&#x27;s friends and neighbors signed an affidavit testifying to his &quot;frugal &amp; industrious&quot; dealings on behalf of his landlord. Carr&#x27;s direct appeal for relief to William Edmeston, on the grounds of old age and a &quot;State of absolute Penury&quot;, was equally without success. Finally, however, a small piece of property was secured for him, and Carr remained in Otsego County until his death in 1804, when he was buried on John Tunnicliff&#x27;s farm near Schuyler Lake.

<doc id="1129902" wikidata="Q897104" url="?curid=1129902" title="Brady Bonds">
<text>Brady bonds are dollar-denominated bonds, issued mostly by Latin American countries in the late 1980s. The bonds were named after U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who proposed a novel debt-reduction agreement for developing countries.

==History==
Brady bonds were created in March 1989 to convert bank loans, mostly in Latin America, into a variety or &quot;menu&quot; of new bonds after many countries defaulted on their debt in the 1980s. At the time, the market for emerging markets&#x27; sovereign debt was small and illiquid, and the standardization of emerging-market debt facilitated risk-spreading and trading. In exchange for commercial bank loans, the countries issued new bonds for the principal sum and, in some cases, unpaid interest. Because they were tradable and came with some guarantees, they were sometimes more valuable to the creditors than the original bonds.

The key innovation behind the introduction of Brady Bonds was to allow the commercial banks to exchange their claims on developing countries into tradable instruments, allowing them to get the debt off their balance sheets. This reduced the concentration risk to those banks.

In the second round, creditors converted their existing claims into their choice among the &quot;menu&quot; of options agreed upon in the first round. The penalties for creditors failing to comply with the terms of the deal were never made explicit. Nevertheless, compliance was not an important problem under the Brady Plan. Banks wishing to cease their foreign lending activities tended to choose the exit option under the auspices of the deal.

By offering a &quot;menu&quot; of options, the Brady Plan permitted credit restructurings to be tailored to the heterogeneous preferences of creditors. The terms achieved under the deals indicate that debtors used the menu approach to reduce the cost of debt reduction. Furthermore, it reduced the holdout problem in which certain holders have an incentive not to participate in the restructuring in the hope of getting a better deal.

The principal amount was usually collateralized by specially issued US Treasury 30-year zero-coupon bonds purchased by the debtor country using a combination of International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the country&#x27;s own foreign currency reserves. Interest payments on Brady bonds, in some cases, are guaranteed by securities of at least double-A-rated credit quality held with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Countries that participated in the initial round of issuing Brady bonds were Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Participating countries were to liberalize their economies in order to qualify for Brady Bonds.

The Brady Bonds were credited for resolving the Latin American debt crisis, but did not prevent future looming debt crises.

==Types==
There were two main types of Brady bonds:
*&quot;Par bonds&quot; were issued to the same value as the original loan, but the coupon on the bonds is below market rate; principal and interest payments are usually guaranteed.
*&quot;Discount bonds&quot; were issued at a discount to the original value of the loan, but the coupon is at market rate; principal and interest payments are usually guaranteed.

Other, less common, types include &quot;front-loaded interest-reduction bonds&quot; (FLIRB), &quot;new-money bonds&quot;, &quot;debt-conversion bonds&quot; (DCB), and &quot;past-due interest bonds&quot; (PDI). Brady Bond negotiations generally involved some form of &quot;haircut.&quot; In other words, the value of the bonds resulting from the restructurings was less than the face value of the claims before the restructurings.

Guarantees attached to Brady bonds included collateral to guarantee the principal, rolling interest guarantees, and value recovery rights. Not all Brady bonds would necessarily have all those forms of guarantee, and the specifics would vary from issuance to issuance.

==Current status==
Although the Brady bond process ended during the 1990s, many of the innovations introduced in these restructurings (call options embedded in the bonds, &quot;stepped&quot; coupons, pars and discounts) were retained in the later sovereign restructurings in, for example, Russia and Ecuador. The latter country, in 1999, became the first country to default on its Brady bonds. In 2003, Mexico became the first country to retire its Brady debt. The Philippines bought back all of its Brady bonds in May 2007, joining Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico as countries that have retired the bonds.

<text>Go!Zilla is a proprietary download manager originally developed by Aaron Ostler in 1995, and later purchased by Radiate in 1999, for use on Windows. It is shareware and its previous ad supported version drew controversy among users and privacy advocates. Upon being acquired by Headlight Software in 2008, the ad-supported versions were discontinued and the software now offers a free limited trial.

Go!Zilla was one of many download managers, also called download accelerators. These particular programs were especially useful when dial-up internet access was more common as it was more difficult to download data due to slow speeds and disconnections. Download accelerators allowed users to stop and resume partial downloads. The software also allowed people to schedule downloads for a convenient time; including while they were away from the computer and was credited with allowing companies to provide a parallel distribution system for their products. In July 2000 the software won PC Magazine&#x27;s ZDNet&#x27;s Seventh Annual &quot;Shareware Award for Best Utility&quot; and was estimated to be used by ten million people at that time.

In January 2008, Go!Zilla was acquired by Headlight Software, and Go!Zilla 5 was the first version released with all new source code and without the bundled adware, which had caused some controversy despite notifying users that adware was bundled.

<doc id="1129912" wikidata="Q235619" url="?curid=1129912" title="Gertrude of Nivelles">
<text>Gertrude of Nivelles, OSB (also spelled &quot;Geretrude&quot;, &quot;Geretrudis&quot;, &quot;Gertrud&quot;; c. 628 – 17 March 659) was a seventh-century abbess who, with her mother Itta, founded the Abbey of Nivelles, now in Belgium. She is venerated in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions.

==Life==
===Family and childhood===
The early history of Gertrude&#x27;s family is not well documented. The anonymous author of her Early Middle Ages biography, &quot;Vita Sanctae Geretrudis&quot;, only hints at her origins: &quot;it would be tedious to insert in this account in what line of earthly origin she was descended. For who living in Europe does not know the loftiness, the names, and the localities of her lineage?&quot;
Gertrude&#x27;s father, Pepin of Landen (Pippin the Elder), a nobleman from east Francia, had been instrumental in persuading King Clothar II to crown his son, Dagobert I, as the King of Austrasia. Due to her position at the palace, Gertrude&#x27;s mother, Itta of Metz, was likely acquainted with Amandus, the Bishop of Maastricht.

When Dagobert succeeded his father and the court moved to Neustria, Pippin and his family (including young Gertrude) moved with the king&#x27;s court. Thus, Gertrude became introduced to politics during her childhood in the royal court. Arnulf of Metz, Pippin&#x27;s close ally, was one of several royal counselors who received ecclesiastical posts after a secular career. McNamara argues that Arnulf retired into religion at the time of Clothar&#x27;s death in 628, but he kept close ties to the family by marrying his son to Gertrude&#x27;s sister, Begga. However, later scholars have disagreed.

====Marriage proposal====
Gertrude&#x27;s biography begins with her father hosting a banquet when Gertrude was ten years old. That the king accepted Pippin&#x27;s invitation to the dinner at all shows Pippin&#x27;s standing as well as that of his family. At this feast, the King asked Gertrude if she would like to marry the &quot;son of a duke of the Austrasians... for the sake of his worldly ambition and mutual alliance.&quot; Gertrude declined and &quot;lost her temper and flatly rejected him with an oath, saying that she would have neither him nor any earthly spouse but Christ the Lord.&quot;

Marriage alliances were important in this era although scholars disagree as to the extent parents or kings asserted power over spousal choice. The marriage between Gertrude&#x27;s sister Begga and Ansegisel helped set the stage for a Carolingian takeover of Austrasia. The marriage of their son Pepin the Middle and Plectrude later secured the lands of Plectrude&#x27;s parents Hugobert and Irmina of Oeren between the Rhine, Moselle and Meuse rivers, because Plectrude was an only child. Begga&#x27;s sons enhanced Pepin&#x27;s power by marrying women with political connections in the north and northwest. All agree that the girl&#x27;s personal feeling mattered little. One scholar speculated that if Pippin I had lived longer, he would likely have forced Gertrude to marry the son of the Austrasian duke, thus giving power to the Pippinids sooner to supplant the Merovingians.

Dagobert died in 639 and was succeeded in Neustria by Clovis II and in Austrasia by Sigebert III. When Pippin died, Gertrude&#x27;s brother Grimoald competed with Otto to become the new mayor of the palace. After Otto died in battle, &quot;the dignity of mayor of Sigebert&#x27;s palace and control of all the kingdom of Austrasia was thus decisively assured to Grimoald&quot; and the Pippinids.

The mention of Gertrude&#x27;s decided rejection of her Austrasian suitor is unique for the era. At least one scholar considers it to have been deliberately included by the chronicler as expressing her character. The reference to a prior betrothal to Christ becomes common in later saints&#x27; lives. The suitor, while irritated, is not emotionally affected by this rejection.

After Dagobert&#x27;s death, Pippin returned to the east in 640, taking Gertrude with him. Soon after, Pippin himself died, giving Gertrude the freedom to take the veil and enter the monastic life. Scholars debate the date of the death of Pippin. Some sources date it as late as 650, although others date it much earlier.

====After her father&#x27;s death====
The &quot;Vita&quot; describes how Itta, in order to prevent &quot;violent abductors from tearing her daughter away by force,&quot; shaved her daughter&#x27;s hair, leaving only a crown shape. This action, known as tonsuring, marked Gertrude for a life of religious service. There were constant requests by &quot;violators of souls&quot; who wished to gain wealth and power by marrying Gertrude. As detailed in the &quot;Vita&quot;, only Itta&#x27;s foundation of the Abbey of Nivelles stopped the constant flow of suitors interested in marrying Gertrude in order to ally with her wealthy family.

Susan Wemple argues that Gertrude&#x27;s story is an example of mothers dominating their daughters in Merovingian times in an effort to &quot;safeguard [their] daughters&#x27; sexual purity and secure [their] future.&quot; Mothers, she says, were required to raise their daughters to be obedient and disciplined, and the standard &quot;maternal feelings&quot; were &quot;vigilance and worry&quot; The biographer of Gertrude mentions that after the death of Pippin the Elder in 640, his widow Itta pondered daily on what was to become of her and her daughter. Upon the advice of Amand, she ordered the construction of a monastery to which she and Gertrude could retire.

According to Wemple, 
&quot;A mother&#x27;s importance was acknowledged in law insofar as she had the right to assume the guardianship for her fatherless children. In the propertied classes, this meant that a widow could exercise considerable power by managing the estates of her minor children and arranging for their marriages.&quot;

Itta lost this right after the death of her husband Pippin because their sons had come of age. She still had the option to find a suitable husband for Gertrude. Catherine Peyroux has said that Itta established the monastery in order to protect her and her daughter in the event that her sons fell out of favor with the ruling dynasty, as well as to safeguard the family lands from plunder or seizure through forced marriage.

===Foundress===

Christianity was not at all widespread in Gertrude&#x27;s place and time. It was only the development of cities and the initiative of bishops that led to a vast movement of evangelism, and a flowering of monasteries in the 7th and 8th centuries.

Gertrude&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; describes how Bishop Amand came to Itta&#x27;s house, &quot;preaching the word of God. At the Lord&#x27;s bidding, he asked whether she would build a monastery for herself and Christ&#x27;s handmaid, Gertrude.&quot; Itta founded Nivelles, a double monastery, one for men, the other for women. However, after they entered the religious life, Gertrude and her mother suffered &quot;no small opposition&quot; from the royal family. During this period, trials for the family are mentioned involving the usurper Otto&#x27;s bid to replace the Pippinids at the side of the king.

There is some precedent for Gertrude and Itta&#x27;s move to the monastery at Nivelles. According to Wemple, &quot;during the second half of the seventh century, women in Neustrian-Burgundian families concentrated on the creation of a network of monasteries rather than on the conclusion of politically advantageous unions, while families whose holdings were in the northeastern parts of the kingdom, centering around the city of Metz, were more concerned with the acquisition of power through carefully arranged marriages.&quot; Itta&#x27;s move to start a monastery was thus not completely out of the ordinary, and may have in fact been the norm for a widowed noblewoman.

Upon Itta&#x27;s death at about the age of 60 in the year 652, twelve years after the death of her husband Pippin, Gertrude took over the monastery. At this time, Gertrude took the &quot;whole burden of governing upon herself alone,&quot; placing affairs of the family in the hands of &quot;good and faithful administrators from the brothers.&quot; Some have argued that this implies that Gertrude ruled the monastery with an abbot. Frankish double monasteries were almost always led by an abbess, or jointly by an abbess and abbot. However, when Suzanne Wemple used Nivelles as an example of the latter, claiming that Gertrude ruled Nivelles jointly with Amand &quot;around 640,&quot; she casts doubt on her own theory by mistaking the date. Many later scholars date the foundation of Nivelles between 647 and 650.

===Monastic life===
The &quot;Vita&quot; states that in Gertrude, &quot;temperance of character, the sobriety of her heart and the moderation of her words she anticipated maturity.&quot; She was &quot;an intelligent young woman, scholarly and charitable, devoting herself to the sick, elderly, and poor,&quot; and as knowing much of the scripture by memory. Gertrude also memorized passages and books on divine law, and she &quot;openly disclosed the hidden mysteries of allegory to her listeners.&quot; Her &quot;Vita&quot; describes Gertrude as building churches, and taking care of orphans, widows, captives, and pilgrims.

Upon becoming abbess, Gertrude &quot;obtained through her envoys men of good reputation, relics of saints and holy books from Rome, and from regions across the sea, experienced men for the teaching of the divine law and to practice the chants for herself and her people.&quot;

Fouracre and Gerberding assert that the men from across the sea are from Britain and Ireland and also highlight this as an example of the importance of Rome to the Franks long before Charlemagne ever had a relationship with the Pope. This is supported by Peyroux, Wemple, and the ancient Chronicles of Fredegar.

She welcomed foreigners, lay or religious. She especially welcomed Irish monks who, since the sixth century, traveled to evangelize. Among the numerous pilgrims that visited the monastery of Nivelles were the two brothers, Foillan and Ultan, both Irish monks on their way from Rome to Peronne, where their brother Fursey, lay buried. According to Wemple, &quot;The Irish monasteries, with the ancient tradition of oral learning, were at the time the most distinguished centers of scholarship&quot;.

===Death of Foillan===

In the &quot;Additum Additamentum Nivialense de Fuilano&quot;, an addendum to the &quot;Vita Sanctae Gertrudis&quot;, there is a story about several events involving Irish monks led by Foillan that involve Gertrude and the Abbey of Nivelles.

Before the foundation of Nivelles, Irish monks led by Foillan traveled to Francia, from Fursey&#x27;s monastery in Ireland to escape pagan raids. They were received by Erchinoald, mayor of the palace, but were later expelled by him and moved to live with Itta and Gertrude. Grimoald and the Pippinids were happy to accept them and built the monastery of Berbrona for them with the help of Itta and Gertrude. In other works this monastery is referred to as Fosses. There is much praise of Gertrude in the text.

Sometime later, Foillan went on a journey, saying mass in Nivelles before leaving. Ian Wood says that the purpose of Foillan&#x27;s journey was to visit his benefactors, but he provides no evidence for this claim other than a citation of the Additamentum. After only a day of traveling, Foillan and his three companions were betrayed and murdered by an evil man who offered them shelter for the night in his house and then sold their belongings. Upon learning that Foillan did not reach his destination, the brothers of his monastery began to search for him. However, it was Gertrude who succeeded in finding Foillan&#x27;s body 77 days after he was murdered, on the anniversary of his brother Fursey&#x27;s death. The four bodies were immediately brought to Nivelles.

&quot;Dido, Bishop of Poitiers, and the mayor of the palace, Grimoald, a man of illustrious standing,&quot; arrived by chance, or, as the text hints, divine intervention at Nivelles shortly before the bodies and the two men carried Foillan into Nivelles &quot;on their own shoulders.&quot; Foillan&#x27;s body was then taken to his own monastery &quot;and when noblemen had flocked from all sides to meet him and carried him on their own shoulders&quot; he was buried at Fosses.

===Miracles===

====Miraculous vision====

The first miracle attributed to Gertrude in the &quot;Vita&quot; takes place at the altar of Pope Sixtus II the Martyr as Gertrude was standing in prayer. &quot;She saw descending above her a flaming pellucid sphere such that the whole basilica was illuminated by its brightness.&quot; The vision persisted for about half an hour and later was revealed to some of the sisters at the monastery. The anonymous author of the &quot;Vita&quot; believes that this vision represents a &quot;visitation of the True Light.&quot;

====Salvation of the sailors====
The second miracle attributed to Gertrude in the &quot;Vita&quot; took place as the anonymous author and his friend were &quot;peacefully sailing over the sea on the monastery&#x27;s business&quot;. This account is felt by some to indicate that the author was an Irish monk. In the account, an incredible storm appears as well as a sea monster, causing great despair as &quot;the sailors... turned to their idols,&quot; evidence of the persistence of paganism at the time. In desperation, the author&#x27;s friend cries out to Gertrude to save himself and his companions from the storm and monster. Immediately the storm subsides and the monster dives back into the deep.

===Appointment of Wulfetrud===
Before her death, Gertrude appointed her niece Wulfetrud as Abbess of Nivelles. Wulfetrud&#x27;s position was precarious because her father, Grimoald I, had usurped the Austrasian throne. According to Ian Wood, &quot;It was the Neustrian court that had ended Grimoald&#x27;s usurpation of the Austrasian throne.&quot; The &quot;Vita&quot; states that &quot;out of hatred of her father that kings, queens, and even priests... wished to drag her from her place&quot; and steal Wulfetrude&#x27;s property. Wulfetrud was only 20 years old at the time.

Wilfetrud&#x27;s appointment was a testament to Gertrude&#x27;s power and influence within the abbey and the Catholic Church itself. According to the &quot;Vita&quot;, Wulfetrud kept her position &quot;through the grace of God.&quot; At the same time, however, Gertrude was unable to help &quot;Grimoald or his daughter against Clovis II.&quot;

===Death===
Gertrude is portrayed as leading a devout life until her death. It is possible that, after taking the veil in circa 640, she never left the monastery cloister, thus escaping politics and local affairs. Gertrude is described as &quot;exhausted by a life of charity, fasting and prayer&quot; at the end of her short life. The Cambridge Medieval History says that &quot;because of too much abstinence and keeping of vigils... her body was sorrily exhausted with serious illness.&quot;

Gertrude&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; describes her, after relinquishing her role as abbess, spending her time praying intensely and secretly wearing a hair shirt. According to her biographer, Gertrude felt the time of her death approaching and asked a pilgrim from the Fosses monastery when she would die. This pilgrim is commonly believed to be Ultan, Foillan&#x27;s brother. Fouracre and Gerberding dispute that Ultan was Abbot of Fosses, but there is some speculation. Ultan prophesied that Gertrude would die on 17 March, the very next day, and also the feast day of Saint Patrick. Furthermore, Ultan prophesied that &quot;she may pass joyously because blessed Bishop Patrick with the chosen angels of God... are prepared to receive her.&quot; True to the prophecy, Gertrude died the next day after praying all night and taking communion. Shortly after her death, the monk Rinchinus as well as the author of the &quot;Vita&quot; noticed a pleasant odor in cell with her body.

Just before her death in 659, Gertrude instructed the nuns at Nivelles to bury her in an old veil left behind by a traveling pilgrim and Gertrude&#x27;s own hair shirt. She died in poverty, 17 March 659, at the age of thirty-three years.

Gertrude&#x27;s choice of burial clothing is a pattern in medieval hagiography as an expression of humility and piety. Her death and the image of her weak and humble figure is, in fact, a critical point in her biographer&#x27;s narrative. Her monastery also benefitted from this portrayal because the haircloth and veil in which Gertrude was interred became relics. Bonnie Effros contends that identification with tombs like Gertrude&#x27;s signaled higher privilege and prestige within the church. Tombs covered with cloths often functioned as altars for those who had access to them. At Nivelles, her relics were only publicly displayed for feast days, Easter, and other holy days.

==Veneration==

Gertrude is the patron saint of the City of Nivelles. The towns of Geertruidenberg, Breda, and Bergen-op-Zoom in North Brabant, also are under her patronage. Gertrude was also the patron saint of the Order of the Holy Cross (Crosiers or Crutched Friars). In the Crosier Church in Maastricht, the Netherlands, a large mural from the 16th century depicts eight scenes from her life and legend.

The legend of Gertrude&#x27;s vision of the ocean voyage led her to be as well the patron saint of travelers. In memory of this event, medieval travelers drank a so-called &quot;Sinte Geerts Minne&quot; or &quot;Gertrudenminne&quot; before setting out on their journey. Her attention to the care of her garden led her assistance to be invoked by gardeners, and also against rats and mental illness.

Le Tour Sainte-Gertrude is a traditional procession around Nivelles. The abbesses and the canons used to regularly make a long journey outside the walls of the abbey in emulation of Gertrude, to meet the farmers, the poor and the sick. Many of the pilgrims participate in costume, as they accompany a cart bearing a reliquary containing Gertrude&#x27;s relics. In May 2004, the Saint Gertrude Tour was proclaimed &quot;Oral and Intangible Heritage Masterpiece of the French Community.&quot; The hundred years-old secondary school &quot;Collège Sainte-Gertrude de Nivelles&quot; founded by the Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier in the city owes its name to the saint.

==Gertrude of Nivelles in Literature==
===&quot;Vita Sanctae Geretrudis&quot; and the &quot;Additamentum Nivialense de Fuilano&quot;===

The &quot;Vita&quot; was originally thought to have been written in the eleventh century, but this was later disproven with the discovery of a version dating from the eighth century. Bruno Krush argues that the work is written around the same time that the events it describes take place, and there is wide agreement that it was written before 670, and after 663. The time range is determined using a combination of Latin style, references by contemporary works, the accuracy of the events (indicating a close proximity to their occurrence), and references in the text to known events. The &quot;Vita&quot; is one of just a few sources dating from seventh century France, and one of only three from Austrasia (all of which deal with Gertrude). This makes the &quot;Vita&quot; very important as a source for Charlemagne&#x27;s ancestry as well as placing the &quot;Cradle of the Carolingians&quot; in the middle Meuse in Brabant as opposed to Moselle in Luxembourg, where Pepin II and Plectrude had large tracts of land.

The author of &quot;Vita&quot; writes as a first-hand witness to the events he describes. Although it is perfectly plausible that he could have been a monk or nun, and there some debate on this topic. Based on his reference to himself &quot;with another brother,&quot; the author is most likely male.

The &quot;Vita&quot; was originally written for Abbot Agnes, who succeeded Wulfetrud upon her death.

===Source integrity===
As indicated by Charlemagne&#x27;s inclusion of Arnulf of Metz in his family tree (in a work by Paul the Deacon, a Lombard), there were incentives to being associated with saints in Carolingian times. Fouracre and Gerberding argue that there were large incentives to being associated with saints in the seventh century as well, casting doubt on the genealogy presented in many sources. However, these scholars argue that the close temporal relationship of the three Austrasian sources to the life of Gertrude as well as the monastic audience of the works make them more than likely credible.

According to Catherine Peyroux, who believes that because author is writing very near Gertrude&#x27;s lifetime, account must at least be &quot;essentially plausible to Gertrude&#x27;s contemporaries.&quot;

==Relationship with Arnulf of Metz==

Gertrude&#x27;s relationship with Arnulf of Metz is a persistent source of confusion for scholars and students alike. Numerous sources point to a relationship between Gertrude and Arnulf, while others believe this relationship is invented. In particular, the debate focuses on Arnulf&#x27;s relationship with Ansegisel, the husband of Begga, Gertrude&#x27;s sister. Sources that include Arnulf in the Pippinid family state that Arnulf is that father of Ansegisel. Sources making the opposite claim do not.

Ian Wood recommends focusing only on the four earliest sources for this information, as later sources are based on these few documents. He starts with the continuations of the chronicles of Fredegar, which do not mention this connection, and are based on an earlier work. He says that &quot;since Childebrand himself was the half-brother of Charles Martel, it is not surprising that the Fredegar continuator add the information contained in the Liber Historiae Francorum material largely concerned with Austrasia and Frisia&quot; in 751. However, he adds no information regarding Arnulf at this time. The Liber is one of the earliest works detailing the history of this period and makes no mention of the relationship between Arnulf and Ansegisel.

Moving to a later source, Wood shows how the Annales Mettenses Priores radically change the picture (from the Liber, the earliest source for the late seventh century, written in 727). The Annales allude to the power held by previous members of the family, especially by Pippin I. They also allude to Pippin I&#x27;s relationship to Arnulf, Bishop of Metz, although they do not specify the nature of that relationship. In addition they talk with great admiration of Pepin II&#x27;s grandmother, Itta, and his Aunt, Gertrude. From the start, therefore, the Annales Mettenses Priores announce their intention of turning the history of the seventh and eighth centuries into a history of the Pippinids, or the Carolingians they were to become.&quot; As a result of this shift, Wood argues that &quot;For the period up until 714, therefore, Annales Mettenses Priores produce a substantially different account of events from that offered by the Liber Historiae Francorum, making Pepin the center of attention, and conferring on him complete power from the Battle of Tertry onwards.&quot;

This change in focus, while not invalid per se, certainly is problematic, because the Annales were written long after the time period they describe. This is especially important, notes Wood, because &quot;as a reading of history the so-called Metz Prior Annals have been extremely influential, providing the most popular interpretation of the late Merovingian period. Nevertheless, they show the Pippinids and Merovingian history as the Carolingians wished to see them.&quot; Despite this different focus, even the Metz Annales do not state that Arnulf is Ansegisel&#x27;s father, saying only that he is a great ally of Pippin.

Wood believes that the shift in focus of the Metz Prior Annals is deliberate, citing the need to glorify the sanctity of the newly powerful Pippinids. &quot;The other asset which the family was to develop, its sanctity, was beginning to be realized only in the last decades of the seventh century. Although Arnulf of Metz is thought to have been Pepin II&#x27;s grandfather, the evidence for this is not early, and even the Annales Mettenses Priores were uncertain about the nature of the relationship between Arnulf and the Pippinids.&quot; According to Wood, this link comes first from Paul the Deacon (Gesta episcoporum Mettensium) and is suspect, as Paul was not familiar with the events he was writing about and had limited access to reference materials.

Of the other early sources that might establish a link between Ansegisel and Arnulf, all that is left is the &quot;Vita Arnulfi&quot;, or &quot;Life of Arnulf.&quot; However, according to Wood, it is &quot;not clear that the &quot;Vita Arnulfi&quot;... was written in the seventh century.&quot; It is possible that this work was a forgery, created later to sanctify the Carolingian line. This argument is not without base, because after Gertrude died in 659, &quot;her sanctity was unquestionably promoted by the family in the late seventh century&quot; beginning with her &quot;&#x27;Vita&quot; in 670.

== Recent popular culture ==
The assignment of Gertrude as patron of cats and the designation of the cat as one of her attributes seems to date from the 1980s. It is not mentioned at all in Madou&#x27;s extensive historical survey from 1975. A more superficial association of Gertrude with the cat as a mouse hunter goes further back. Her veneration as protector against rats and mice dates from the early 15th century during the Black Plague and spread from Southwestern Germany to the Netherlands and Catalonia. Some 20th-century folkloristics research conflated her with the Germanic goddess Frigg, who may have been depicted riding a cat. The authoritative &quot;Handwörterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens&quot; (published in multiple volumes, 1927–1942) does not verify the connection to cats. The first major English-language publication presenting her as patron of cats is a 1981 catalogue of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The team plays its home games in the Estadio Municipal de Puntarenas Miguel Ángel &quot;Lito&quot; Pérez Treacy nicknamed &quot;La Olla Mágica&quot; (&quot;The Magic Cauldron&quot;) in Puntarenas Centro, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, known by that name because of the high temperatures of the zone and the unstopping support from the fans along the games.

==History==

===A.D. Municipal Puntarenas===
The club was founded in June 2004, by Adrián Castro Velásquez and Eduardo Li Sánchez and is basically a spinoff of the &quot;A.D. Municipal Puntarenas&quot; club, founded on January 9, 1952 which until 2001 had spent 34 seasons in the Primera División (UNAFUT). Municipal Puntarenas debuted in the Primera División on 19 April 1964 and won their first and only division title in the 1986–87 season against Alajuelense, they also finished second three more times. In 2002 Municipal Puntarenas was relegated to Liga de Ascenso, Segunda División (LIASCE) and in 2009 to third division Primera División de Liga Nacional de Futbol Aficionado (LINAFA).

===A.D. Sánta Barbara franchise purchased===
Municipal Puntarenas&#x27;s relegation in 2001 and Municipal Osa&#x27;s descent in 2003 left Puntarenas Province without a Primera División club so Li and Castro purchased the franchise of &quot;A.D. Santa Bárbara&quot; to restore the province&#x27;s presence in the top tier.

Santa Bárbara had made their debut in the Primera in the 1997–98 season with 4th place being their best league result.

===Puntarenas F.C.===
Puntarenas F.C. counts with the supporter group &quot;Estação La Samba Primeira&quot; that brings cheers and music to the local games. Puntarenas F.C. played its first game on August 22, 2004, in Estadio Miguel &quot;Lito&quot; Pérez, beating Belén 2–1. They became one of the best teams in the Primera División, being in the first 3 places in their first 3 years as a new team, starting a rivalry with Saprissa and Alajuelense, the most successful teams in the country. According to IFFHS Club World Ranking, Puntarenas F.C. ranked 342 (285) in the World in 2007, making them one of the best squads in Costa Rica and in the UNCAF region.

On July 4, 2007, Eduardo Li Sánchez resigned as team owner and President to take over the reins of Federación Costarricense de Fútbol (FEDEFUTBOL) as president. Owner and Vice President Adrián Castro Velásquez became the club&#x27;s new president and sole proprietor.

On December 9, 2008, it was announced that Alejandro Márquez, owner of Mexican second division football club Atlético Celaya had bought 50 percent of the shares of Puntarenas F.C. making it the second Costa Rican team with Mexican interest. Márquez was elected vice president.

On February 16, 2009, Adrián Castro Velásquez was assassinated as he left his house in Miramar de Montes de Oro en route to Puntarenas Centro, by a pair of hitman on a motorbike to settle a business dispute. As a result of Castro&#x27;s tragic death, his wife María Alejandra Ordóñez Lucovich took over his half of the club&#x27;s shares. The board of directors elected Adrian&#x27;s son Marcelo Enrique Castro as second Vice President and Víctor Herrera as president.

On June 27, 2009, it was reported that Alejandro Márquez defaulted on his contract with the club. Alejandra Ordóñez took full ownership, control of all club assets and the Presidency.

In 2009, Score One Soccer became equity partner of Puntarenas F.C. and was also granted a 10-year contract by Municipalidad de Puntarenas to operate Estadio Miguel &quot;Lito&quot; Pérez.

In April 2014, Puntarenas were relegated to the Second Division.

In May 2022, Puntarenas beat Carmelita 3–0 on aggregate to win the second division and ascend to Costa Rica&#x27;s top flight for the first time since 2014.

==Honours==
*UNCAF Interclub Cup
**Winners (1): 2006

==Stadium==
The stadium belongs to the municipality of Puntarenas and is used by the teams of the Liga Gatorade de Ascenso, Puntarenas Fútbol Club and Marineros de Puntarenas, in addition to the Third Division team, the Puntarenas San Luis Fútbol Club.

The stadium is being upgraded with lighting. The Municipality of Puntarenas plans to have the best lighting in all of Central America.
According to the Ministry of Health, the recommended capacity is 4,105 spectators:

North or Shadow Grandstand: 1680 people

South Grandstand: 825 people

East Grandstand: 800 people

West Grandstand: 800 people

It has natural grass but the company Score One Soccer, which has shares of the Puntarenas Fútbol Club and will manage the stadium for 10 years, will remodel it. The dressing rooms and press areas of the stadium have already been remodeled.
It is located 200 m. west of the Courts of Justice, on Avenida Centenario. Downtown Puntarenas.

<text>In astronomy, metallicity is the abundance of elements present in an object that are heavier than hydrogen and helium. Most of the normal currently detectable (i.e. non-dark) matter in the universe is either hydrogen or helium, and astronomers use the word &quot;metals&quot; as convenient shorthand for &quot;all elements except hydrogen and helium&quot;. This word-use is distinct from the conventional chemical or physical definition of a metal as an electrically conducting solid. Stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of heavier elements are called &quot;metal-rich&quot; when discussing metallicity, even though many of those elements are called nonmetals in chemistry.
==Metals in early spectroscopy==

In 1802, William Hyde Wollaston noted the appearance of a number of dark features in the solar spectrum. In 1814, Joseph von Fraunhofer independently rediscovered the lines and began to systematically study and measure their wavelengths, and they are now called Fraunhofer lines. He mapped over 570 lines, designating the most prominent with the letters A through K and weaker lines with other letters.

About 45 years later, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen noticed that several Fraunhofer lines coincide with characteristic emission lines identifies in the spectra of heated chemical elements. They inferred that dark lines in the solar spectrum are caused by absorption by chemical elements in the solar atmosphere. Their observations were in the visible range where the strongest lines come from metals such as sodium, potassium, and iron. In the early work on the chemical composition of the sun the only elements that were detected in spectra were hydrogen and various metals, with the term &quot;metallic&quot; frequently used when describing them. In contemporary usage in astronomy all the extra elements beyond just hydrogen and helium are termed metallic.

==Origin of metallic elements==

The presence of heavier elements results from stellar nucleosynthesis, where the majority of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the Universe (&quot;metals&quot;, hereafter) are formed in the cores of stars as they evolve. Over time, stellar winds and supernovae deposit the metals into the surrounding environment, enriching the interstellar medium and providing recycling materials for the birth of new stars. It follows that older generations of stars, which formed in the metal-poor early Universe, generally have lower metallicities than those of younger generations, which formed in a more metal-rich Universe.

==Stellar populations==

Observed changes in the chemical abundances of different types of stars, based on the spectral peculiarities that were later attributed to metallicity, led astronomer Walter Baade in 1944 to propose the existence of two different populations of stars.
These became commonly known as (metal-rich) and (metal-poor) stars. A third, earliest stellar population was hypothesized in 1978, known as stars. These &quot;extremely metal-poor&quot; (XMP) stars are theorized to have been the &quot;first-born&quot; stars created in the Universe.

== Common methods of calculation ==

Astronomers use several different methods to describe and approximate metal abundances, depending on the available tools and the object of interest. Some methods include determining the fraction of mass that is attributed to gas versus metals, or measuring the ratios of the number of atoms of two different elements as compared to the ratios found in the Sun.

=== Mass fraction ===
Stellar composition is often simply defined by the parameters , , and . Here represents the mass fraction of hydrogen, is the mass fraction of helium, and is the mass fraction of all the remaining chemical elements. Thus

formula_1

In most stars, nebulae, H regions, and other astronomical sources, hydrogen and helium are the two dominant elements. The hydrogen mass fraction is generally expressed as formula_2 where is the total mass of the system, and formula_3 is the mass of the hydrogen it contains. Similarly, the helium mass fraction is denoted as formula_4 The remainder of the elements are collectively referred to as &quot;metals&quot;, and the mass fraction of metals is calculated as

formula_5

For the surface of the Sun (symbol formula_6), these parameters are measured to have the following values:

Due to the effects of stellar evolution, neither the initial composition nor the present day bulk composition of the Sun is the same as its present-day surface composition.

===Chemical abundance ratios===
The overall stellar metallicity is conventionally defined using the total hydrogen content, since its abundance is considered to be relatively constant in the Universe, or the iron content of the star, which has an abundance that is generally linearly increasing in time in the Universe.
Hence, iron can be used as a chronological indicator of nucleosynthesis. Iron is relatively easy to measure with spectral observations in the star&#x27;s spectrum given the large number of iron lines in the star&#x27;s spectra (even though oxygen is the most abundant heavy element – see metallicities in H regions below). The abundance ratio is the common logarithm of the ratio of a star&#x27;s iron abundance compared to that of the Sun and is calculated thus:

formula_7

where formula_8 and formula_9 are the number of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit of volume respectively, formula_6 is the standard symbol for the Sun, and formula_11 for a star (often omitted below). The unit often used for metallicity is the dex, contraction of &quot;decimal exponent&quot;. By this formulation, stars with a higher metallicity than the Sun have a positive common logarithm, whereas those more dominated by hydrogen have a corresponding negative value. For example, stars with a formula_12 value of +1 have 10 times the metallicity of the Sun (); conversely, those with a formula_12 value of −1 have , while those with a formula_12 value of 0 have the same metallicity as the Sun, and so on.

Young population I stars have significantly higher iron-to-hydrogen ratios than older population II stars. Primordial population III stars are estimated to have metallicity less than −6, a millionth of the abundance of iron in the Sun.
The same notation is used to express variations in abundances between other individual elements as compared to solar proportions. For example, the notation formula_15 represents the difference in the logarithm of the star&#x27;s oxygen abundance versus its iron content compared to that of the Sun. In general, a given stellar nucleosynthetic process alters the proportions of only a few elements or isotopes, so a star or gas sample with certain formula_16 values may well be indicative of an associated, studied nuclear process.

===Photometric colors===
Astronomers can estimate metallicities through measured and calibrated systems that correlate photometric measurements and spectroscopic measurements (see also Spectrophotometry). For example, the Johnson UVB filters can be used to detect an ultraviolet (UV) excess in stars,
where a smaller UV excess indicates a larger presence of metals that absorb the UV radiation, thereby making the star appear &quot;redder&quot;.
The UV excess, (U−B), is defined as the difference between a star&#x27;s U and B band magnitudes, compared to the difference between U and B band magnitudes of metal-rich stars in the Hyades cluster.
Unfortunately, (U−B) is sensitive to both metallicity and temperature: If two stars are equally metal-rich, but one is cooler than the other, they will likely have different (U−B) values (see also Blanketing effect).
To help mitigate this degeneracy, a star&#x27;s B−V color index can be used as an indicator for temperature. Furthermore, the UV excess and B−V index can be corrected to relate the (U−B) value to iron abundances.

Other photometric systems that can be used to determine metallicities of certain astrophysical objects include the Strӧmgren system,
the Geneva system, the Washington system,
and the DDO system.

== Metallicities in various astrophysical objects ==

=== Stars ===
At a given mass and age, a metal-poor star will be slightly warmer. metallicities are roughly to of the Sun&#x27;s formula_17 but the group appears cooler than overall, as heavy population II stars have long since died. Above 40 solar masses, metallicity influences how a star will die: Outside the pair-instability window, lower metallicity stars will collapse directly to a black hole, while higher metallicity stars undergo a type Ib/c supernova and may leave a neutron star.

==== Relationship between stellar metallicity and planets ====
A star&#x27;s metallicity measurement is one parameter that helps determine whether a star may have a giant planet, as there is a direct correlation between metallicity and the presence of a giant planet. Measurements have demonstrated the connection between a star&#x27;s metallicity and gas giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn. The more metals in a star and thus its planetary system and protoplanetary disk, the more likely the system may have gas giant planets. Current models show that the metallicity along with the correct planetary system temperature and distance from the star are key to planet and planetesimal formation. For two stars that have equal age and mass but different metallicity, the less metallic star is bluer. Among stars of the same color, less metallic stars emit more ultraviolet radiation. The Sun, with eight planets and nine consensus dwarf planets, is used as the reference, with a formula_18 of 0.00.

==== H regions ====
Young, massive and hot stars (typically of spectral types O and B) in H regions emit UV photons that ionize ground-state hydrogen atoms, knocking electrons free; this process is known as photoionization. The free electrons can strike other atoms nearby, exciting bound metallic electrons into a metastable state, which eventually decay back into a ground state, emitting photons with energies that correspond to forbidden lines. Through these transitions, astronomers have developed several observational methods to estimate metal abundances in H regions, where the stronger the forbidden lines in spectroscopic observations, the higher the metallicity. These methods are dependent on one or more of the following: the variety of asymmetrical densities inside H regions, the varied temperatures of the embedded stars, and/or the electron density within the ionized region.

Theoretically, to determine the total abundance of a single element in an H region, all transition lines should be observed and summed. However, this can be observationally difficult due to variation in line strength. Some of the most common forbidden lines used to determine metal abundances in H regions are from oxygen (e.g. [O] = (3727, 7318, 7324) Å, and [O] = (4363, 4959, 5007) Å), nitrogen (e.g. [N] = (5755, 6548, 6584) Å), and sulfur (e.g. [S] = (6717, 6731) Å and [S] = (6312, 9069, 9531) Å) in the optical spectrum, and the [O] = (52, 88) μm and [N] = 57 μm lines in the infrared spectrum. Oxygen has some of the stronger, more abundant lines in H regions, making it a main target for metallicity estimates within these objects. To calculate metal abundances in H regions using oxygen flux measurements, astronomers often use the 23 method, in which

formula_19

where formula_20 is the sum of the fluxes from oxygen emission lines measured at the rest frame = (3727, 4959 and 5007) Å wavelengths, divided by the flux from the Balmer series H emission line at the rest frame = 4861 Å wavelength.
This ratio is well defined through models and observational studies, but caution should be taken, as the ratio is often degenerate, providing both a low and high metallicity solution, which can be broken with additional line measurements.
Similarly, other strong forbidden line ratios can be used, e.g. for sulfur, where

formula_21

Metal abundances within H regions are typically less than 1%, with the percentage decreasing on average with distance from the Galactic Center.

<doc id="1129920" wikidata="Q176915" url="?curid=1129920" title="Battle of Tinian">
<text>The Battle of Tinian was part of the Pacific campaign of World War II. It was fought between the United States and Japan on the island of Tinian in the Mariana Islands from 24 July until 1 August 1944. The battle saw napalm used for the first time.

At the Cairo Conference in December 1943, the US and British Combined Chiefs of Staff endorsed a two-pronged attack through the Central Pacific and Southwest Pacific Areas. On 12 March 1944, the Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, was directed to neutralize Truk and occupy the Mariana Islands. The Mariana Islands were targeted because of their location astride the Japanese line of communications. Tinian lay too close to Saipan to allow it to be bypassed and remain in Japanese hands. Following the conclusion of the Battle of Saipan on 9 July, Major General Harry Schmidt&#x27;s V Amphibious Corps began preparations to invade nearby Tinian. The Japanese defending the island were commanded by Colonel Kiyochi Ogata, the commander of the 50th Infantry Regiment. This regiment was part of the 5,000 Army troops on the island. There were also about 4,000 Imperial Japanese Navy personnel on Tinian, the main force being the 56th Naval Guard Force, under the command of Captain Goichi Oie. Most of the island was surrounded by coral cliffs, so Ogata concentrated his forces on the southwest of the island, where the best landing beaches were located.

Major General Clifton B. Cates&#x27;s 4th Marine Division landed on Tinian on 24 July 1944, supported by naval bombardment and the guns of the XXIV Corps Artillery, firing across the strait from Saipan. Instead of landing in the southwest, they landed on the northwest coast, where there were two small beaches that were lightly defended. These beaches were flanked by low coral cliffs that the marines were able to surmount with the aid of ramps mounted on modified amphibious tractors (LVTs). A successful feint in the southwest by Major General Thomas E. Watson&#x27;s 2nd Marine Division distracted defenders from the actual landing site on the north of the island. The 2nd Marine Division then landed behind the 4th Marine Division. The weather worsened on 28 July, damaging the pontoon causeways and interrupting the unloading of supplies, but on 30 July the 4th Marine Division occupied Tinian Town and the airfield. Japanese remnants conducted a last stand in the caves and ravines of a limestone ridge on the south portion of the island. Although the island was declared secure on 1 August, mopping up patrols continued into 1945.

Tinian became an important base for further US operations in the Pacific. North Field became operational in February 1945 and West Field in March. The Seabees built six runways for the Twentieth Air Force&#x27;s Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. Bombers based on Tinian took part in the bombing of Tokyo in March 1945 and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

==Background==

===Strategy===
After World War I, the United States had developed a series of contingency plans for the event of a war with Japan known as the Orange plans. These envisaged an advance through the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the Philippines, from whence Japan could be blockaded. The Mariana Islands figured only incidentally in the plans, as they lay north of the direct route between Hawaii and the Philippines. During World War II, the islands attracted the attention of naval and air strategists. At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, the US and British Combined Chiefs of Staff had endorsed an offensive in the Central Pacific along the lines envisaged in the Orange plans. In his formulation of the strategy, the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King, specifically mentioned the Mariana Islands as &quot;the key to the situation because of their location on the Japanese line of communications.&quot;

The Joint Chiefs of Staff envisaged the Marianas as a naval base, but another rationale for the capture of the Mariana Islands emerged with the development of the long-range Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber. From the Mariana Islands, the B-29s could reach all the most significant industrial targets in Japan, and they could be supported by sea. The air staff planners began incorporating the Mariana Islands into their long-range plans in September 1943. The Combined Chiefs endorsed this at the Cairo Conference in December, along with a two-pronged offensive, with the Central Pacific drive in conjunction with one along the north coast of New Guinea. In response, the Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPOA), Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, produced a campaign plan called Operation Granite, which tentatively scheduled the capture of Mariana Islands of Saipan, Tinian and Guam for November 1944 as the culmination of the Central Pacific campaign.

By February 1944, there was consideration of advancing the Operation Granite timetable by bypassing Truk and heading directly for Palau or the Marianas after the capture of the Marshall Islands. On 7 March, Nimitz and his Deputy Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Forrest P. Sherman met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, DC, where they were questioned by the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, and the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief, Admiral William D. Leahy. Sherman argued that the neutralization of Truk required the occupation of the Mariana Islands to cut the air route to Truk from Japan. On 12 March, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed Nimitz to neutralize Truk and occupy the Mariana Islands.

Tinian was considered a target from the outset, Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith&#x27;s Northern Troops and Landing Force (NTLF) was ordered to &quot;land on, seize, occupy and defend Saipan. Then be prepared to seize Tinian on order.&quot; The American forces assaulted Saipan on 15 June. The Battle of Saipan lasted until 9 July, when the island was declared &quot;secured&quot;. The cost was high: 14,111 of the 71,034 NTLF personnel were killed, wounded or missing in action. Mopping up operations continued until October, but preparations began immediately for the attack on Tinian.

Plans to capture Tinian were prepared concurrently with those to capture Saipan. Tinian lay only from the southern tip of Saipan, and its proximity to Saipan meant that while it remained in Japanese hands, Japanese aircraft could attack Saipan by staging though Tinian. The garrison might raid Saipan, and they could observe ship and aircraft movements on Saipan and communicate them to Tokyo. 

Tinian also had value in its own right, as its flat terrain made it highly suitable for the development of air bases. There were already airfields that looked promising for development into B-29 airfields. Ushi Point Airfield (Airfield No. 1) was the main airfield; it had a hard-surfaced runway long. Two other airfields were in use and another was under construction: Airfield No. 3, which lay immediately south of no.1; Airfield No. 2, at Gurguan Point; and the unfinished Airfield No. 4 near Tinian Town.
===Geography===
Along with the other Mariana Islands, Tinian was claimed for Spain by Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565. Guam was seized by the United States in the Spanish-American War, and Spain sold the remaining islands to Germany. They were occupied by Japan during World War I and became part of Japan&#x27;s South Seas Mandate. Tinian lay just from the southern tip of Saipan. It covered about , measuring from north to south, and across at its widest point. The terrain was generally low and flat, making it suitable for airfields. There were two hills in the north: the Mount Maga and the Mount Lasso. There was also a rugged limestone hill mass of cliffs and ravines in the south. About 90 percent of the island (approximately ) was covered in sugar cane fields. The square fields gave the island a checker board look from the air. Fields were surrounded by drainage ditches or windbreaks of trees or hedgerows.
Most of the island was encircled by jagged limestone cliffs that ranged from high. There were only a few beaches, which the Americans designated by colors. The best beaches were around Sunharon Bay in the southeast: Blue Beach, south of Tinian Town, was long; Green Beach One, located between the two piers at Tinian Town, was also long; Green Beach Two, at the southern end of Tinian Town, was long; Red Beach One and Two were north of the piers, with a combined width of ; and Orange Beach, north of Red Beach One, was long.

There were two beaches on the east coast at Asiga Bay: the Yellow Beach One and the Yellow Beach Two. These were flanked by cliffs and subject to heavy surf when there was an easterly wind. There were also two small beaches on the northwest coast: the White Beach One and the White Beach Two. The small size of the White and Yellow beaches made them unattractive: a division normally required a landing beach long.
There was little seasonal variation in temperature, which ranged from an average of in January to in June, but the average humidity in those months was 78 and 84 percent, respectively. Fair weather prevailed during the dry season from November to March, but the wet season from April to November was characterized by frequent rains and occasional typhoons. Sunharon Bay was little more than an anchorage, and was unusable in rough weather.

According to a 1 January 1944 census, Tinian had a population of 18,000 Japanese civilians, most of whom worked in the sugar cane industry, and 26 ethnic Chamorro people; most of the original population had been forcibly removed to other islands. The main settlements were Tinian Town in the south and two small villages around Ushi Point Airfield in the north. The former was the administrative center of the island, while the latter housed airfield workers. The primary road network consisted of roads approximately wide and surfaced with crushed coral. They were generally straight, following the edges of the cane fields. Approximately of narrow gauge railways connected the sugar plantations with Tinian Town. 

==Opposing forces and plans==

===Japanese===
The senior Japanese officer on Tinian was Vice Admiral Kakuji Kakuta, the commander of First Air Fleet. His headquarters was in Manila but he was on Tinian on an inspection tour when US aerial operations in the Marianas Islands began on 11 June and became cut off. He exercised no command authority over the army troops on the island, and the naval troops were not subject to his direct command.
The Imperial Japanese Army force defending the island was the 50th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Kiyochi Ogata. This was part of the 29th Division, all the rest of which was located on Guam. The regiment was formerly based at Mukden in China, and had moved to Tinian in March 1944. It had three infantry battalions, a mountain artillery battalion with twelve 75mm guns, an anti-tank company with six 37 mm anti-tank guns, and a company of the 18th Infantry Regiment with twelve light tanks. The 1st Battalion, 135th Infantry Regiment, under the command of Captain Bunzo Izumi. Part of the 43rd Division, it had been formed in Nagoya in July 1943. It was normally based on Saipan, but was conducting amphibious landing exercises on Tinian on 11 June and became cut off when Saipan was invaded. It provided a fourth infantry battalion that Ogata incorporated into the island&#x27;s defense. The Army forces on Tinian totaled about 5,000 men. Most were well-trained combat veterans with prior combat experience in the war in China. They were skilled in camouflage and the use of their weapons. They were well-equipped, in many cases with new weapons, and their morale was high.

The main Imperial Japanese Navy force on Tinian was the 56th Naval Guard Force (), under the command of Captain Goichi Oie. He accepted Ogata as the commander on Tinian, but to avoid embarrassment, he did not inform his subordinates that their orders came from an Army officer. His force of 1,400 troops and 600 laborers was equipped with three 6-inch and ten 140 mm coast defence guns, and ten 120 mm and four 76.2 mm general purpose guns, twenty-four 25 mm and six 7 cm antiaircraft guns, and three 12 cm dual-purpose guns. Along with airfield construction crews, flight technicians and staff, there were about 4,000 sailors of various units on Tinian. Most of the naval personnel had some training as infantry. In addition, there were three civilian defence organizations of little military value, the Civilian Militia, the Home Guard Organization, and Youth Organization, and about sixty comfort women, none of whom survived the battle.

After Saipan had fallen on 9 July, the prospects for the garrison of Tinian were grim. Ogata expected that Tinian would be the next target, and on 25 June he issued a operational order that announced: &quot;the enemy on Saipan... can be expected to be planning a landing on Tinian. The area of that landing is estimated to be either Tinian Harbor or Asiga (northeast coast) Harbor.&quot; He adhered to the Japanese doctrine of defense against amphibious attacks at the water&#x27;s edge. Each of the sector commanders was ordered to &quot;be prepared to destroy the enemy at the beach, but be prepared to shift two-thirds of the force elsewhere.&quot;

Ogata was aided by the geography of Tinian, which limited the possible landing sites. He positioned the 3rd Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment and most of the heavy weapons of the 56th Naval Guard Force, around Sunharon Bay beaches. The Northern Sector around Asiga Bay was covered by the 2nd Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment. He did not expect anything more than a raid on the beaches in the west, so this was assigned to the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment. The rest of the 1st Battalion was dug in around Mount Lasso. The 1st Battalion, 135th Infantry Regiment formed a mobile counterattack force, along with the tanks and a mobile artillery contingent of twelve Type 94 75 mm mountain guns. The reserve was positioned so as to quickly reach either the Sunharon Bay or Asiga bay, depending on where the Americans made their main effort.

===United States===

The American forces were part of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance&#x27;s Fifth Fleet. The Joint Amphibious Forces (Task Force 51) were led by Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner and the expeditionary troops (Task Force 56) by Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith. For the battle of Saipan, Turner had concurrently commanded the landing force (Task Force 52) and Smith had also commanded the NTLF and V Amphibious Corps, but with simultaneous operations on Guam in prospect, it was desirable for these roles to be separated. On 12 July, Smith became the commander of the newly established Fleet Marine Force, Pacific and handed over command of the V Amphibious Corps and NTLF (Task Group 56.1) to Major General Harry Schmidt. Command of the amphibious forces in the Tinian operation (Task Force 52) was entrusted to Turner&#x27;s former deputy, Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill, on 15 July. Although Turner and Smith remained in command of Task Forces 51 and 56 respectively, they sailed for Guam on 20 July, leaving the operation entirely in the hands of Hill and Schmidt.

For the Tinian operation, the V Amphibious Corps had the 2nd Marine Division, commanded by Major General Thomas E. Watson and the 4th Marine Division, which was commanded by Major General Clifton B. Cates, who had succeeded Schmidt. Both had seen service earlier in the Pacific War: the 2nd Marine Division on Guadalcanal and Tarawa, and the 4th Marine Division in the Battle of Kwajalein, and had participated in the recent fighting on Saipan, where they had incurred 6,170 and 6,612 battle casualties respectively. They had absorbed a single replacement draft of 1,268 men before the fighting began again on Tinian, but remained understength, and much of their equipment had been worn out through combat and hard use.

The V Amphibious Corps had the support of Brigadier General Arthur M. Harper&#x27;s XXIV Corps Artillery with its two battalions of 155 mm guns and two battalions of 155 mm howitzers. For the Tinian operation, Harper also had command of the four battalions of the 27th Infantry Division Artillery and five Marine Corps 105 mm howitzer battalions, two each from the two marine divisions and one from the V Amphibious Corps, for a total of thirteen battalions, each of which had twelve guns or howitzers. The rest of the 27th Infantry Division, except for the 105th Infantry, was in reserve, but on four hours&#x27; notice to embark for Tinian.
American intelligence about Tinian and the Japanese defenses there was excellent. The Joint Intelligence Center Pacific Ocean Area (JICPOA), under the command of Brigadier General Joseph J. Twitty, assembled intelligence obtained from imagery intelligence, human intelligence and reference information, backed up by Ultra intelligence derived from code breaking and signals intelligence. JICPOA produced a report on Tinian&#x27;s hydrography and geography on 10 May 1944, that also detailed the locations of many of the defenses, and issued a series of topographic maps. A series of oblique aerial photographs were taken of Tinian&#x27;s beaches. The headquarters of the Japanese 31st Army on Saipan was overrun in mid-June, and captured documents provided a full order of battle of the Japanese forces on Tinian. The Americans estimated the strength of the Japanese garrison as 8,039, which was quite accurate. The XXIV Corps Artillery began bombarding Tinian on 20 June, even as the fighting on Saipan continued, and its Saipan-based observation aircraft conducted daily flights over Tinian.

The intelligence reports revealed that the best landing beaches were around Sunharon Bay, but they were also the most heavily defended. The staff of the 4th Marine Division, particularly the plans officer, Lieutenant Colonel Evans F. Carlson, preferred to land in the north, where the beaches were poorer but the defenses were weaker and tactical surprise could be attained. Independently, Hill&#x27;s staff arrived at the same conclusion. Turner was not convinced. &quot;If we go ashore at Tinian Town,&quot; Smith told him, &quot;we&#x27;ll have another Tarawa. Sure as hell! The Japs will murder us. What&#x27;s more, we probably will be repulsed, and that will upset our entire timetable. What do you say to that?&quot;
Turner noted that the Sunharon Bay beaches had good gradients and inland approaches, that there was a protected harbor for small craft, and facilities for unloading supplies. Whereas the northern beaches were too small to land and support a force of the size contemplated, and were exposed to the weather, so if it turned bad the movement of supplies from Saipan could be obstructed or halted. An advance from north to south would likely take longer than one from east to west, and while artillery support from Saipan would be available in the early stages, unfavorable weather could prevent it being moved to Tinian to cover the advance once it moved further south.

In view of these objections, Schmidt ordered a reconnaissance of the Yellow and White Beaches. On the night of 10/11 July, Companies A and B of Captain James L. Jones&#x27;s V Amphibious Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion and Underwater Demolition Teams 5 and 7 set out in the high-speed transports and . They were launched in rubber boats and paddled to within of the shore, then swam the rest of the way. The underwater demolition teams investigated the offshore reefs while the marines swam ashore and studied the beaches. Yellow Beach 1 was found to be strung with a double apron wire obstacle, with cliffs to the south that were high and unscalable without ladders or cargo nets.
A strong current was encountered by the groups sent to reconnoitre the White Beaches, and the rubber boats wound up too far north. Consequently, the reconnaissance of White Beach 1 was carried out by the group intended to land on White Beach 2, and that of White Beach 2 had to be carried out the following night. They found that although White Beach 1 was only long, the cliffs for on either side were only high with small breaks, and could be negotiated by infantry without ladders or nets. Only the central of White Beach 2 could be reached by amphibian vehicles. Both White Beaches had gentle grades and it was possible for LCVPs to land on the reef from the beach and for infantry to wade ashore from there.

With this information in hand, a conference was held on board Turner&#x27;s flagship, the , on 12 July. Schmidt made the case for a landing on the White Beaches, citing six factors: (1) that a landing at Sunharon Bay would be too costly; (2) that the XXIV Corps Artillery could cover the beaches from Saipan; (3) the airfield at Ushi Point could be quickly captured and utilized; (4) tactical surprise could be attained; (5) the whole operation could be conducted from Saipan as a shore-to-shore movement; and (6) supplies could be preloaded on vehicles and driven straight to dumps, thereby avoiding congestion on the beaches. Spruance called for a vote, in order of seniority, and Watson, Schmidt, Hill and Smith voted for the White Beach plan. To Spruance&#x27;s relief, Turner agreed to make the decision unanimous. On 20 July, Spruance confirmed the day of the assault, J-Day (or Jig-Day, using the phonetic alphabet of the time), as 24 July. Hill then chose 0730 as H-Hour.

==Battle==
===Bombardment===

Artillery bombardment of Tinian commenced on 20 June when Battery B of the 531st Field Artillery Battalion began shelling targets on Tinian with its 155 mm &quot;Long Tom&quot; guns. In the days leading up to the landing, the XXIV Corps Artillery used 24,536 rounds on 1,509 counter-battery fire, harassing fire and area bombardment missions. The XXIV Corps Artillery had its own observation aircraft, nine Piper L-4 Grasshoppers based at Aslito Field on Saipan. One was forced to ditch off Tinian Town on 28 July due to engine failure. The crew was rescued by the cruiser but the aircraft was lost. Another was forced down by Japanese fire the following day but landed safely behind American lines. The Marine artillery had the support of the Stinson OY Sentinel observation aircraft of VMO-2 and VMO-4.

The US naval bombardment commenced on 13 June, with the fire support ships of Task Force 52 engaging targets on Tinian that could interfere with operations on Saipan. On 25 June, the destroyer escort and destroyer detected Japanese barges attempting to leave Sunharon Harbor and destroyed them. The bombardment was stepped up on 26 June, when the cruisers , and began a week of systematic attacks. On 23 July, the day before the landing, three battleships, five cruisers and sixteen destroyers participated in the bombardment. The battleship engaged the three 140 mm coast defense guns at Faibus San Hilo Point, which could enfilade the White Beaches from defilade of the artillery on Saipan. Sixty 16-inch shells completely destroyed the battery. Meanwhile, the battleships and fired 480 14-inch and 800 5-inch rounds into Tinian Town, reducing it to rubble.
The bombardment lifted for three periods of 40 to 60 minutes to allow for aerial bombardment. At least 200 sorties were flown from the aircraft carriers and , and another 50 or more from the escort carriers and . Aslito Field-based Army Air Force Republic P-47 Thunderbolts of the 318th Fighter Group flew more than 100 sorties. The group&#x27;s 19th Fighter Squadron had arrived on Saipan on 22 June after being catapulted from the escort carriers and , and had flown its first mission over Tinian that day. Attempts by destroyers to burn wooded areas with white phosphorus and thermite on 18 and 19 July failed due to the wet foliage, so napalm was tried for the first time. The 318th Fighter Group flew 18 napalm sorties, but results were inconclusive, as the best mixture had not yet been devised, but it had some success setting the canefields alight.

On J-Day, 24 July, a feint was made to distract the defenders from the actual landing site. This was carried out by the 2nd and 8th Marines of the 2nd Marine Division. The attack transports , , , and and troopships and took them to a point about offshore from Tinian Town, where they boarded landing craft using cargo nets, and then climbed back again. The empty landing craft then made a run for the shore until Japanese shore batteries started firing at them. The landing craft regrouped and made a second run, but turned back again from the beach. Around 10:00 the transports recovered the landing craft, and headed for the transport area off the White Beaches.

While covering the feint, &quot;Colorado&quot; and the destroyer were hit by the three Japanese 6-inch guns, which were concealed in caves southwest of the Tinian Town pier. &quot;Colorado&quot; was hit twenty-two times, killing 43 men and wounding 198. &quot;Norman Scott&quot; was hit six times, killing the captain, Commander Seymore Owens and 18 of his men and wounding 47. &quot;Colorado&quot;, the cruiser and the destroyer silenced the battery, but did not destroy it; this was accomplished on 28 July by &quot;Tennessee&quot;, with 70 14-inch and 150 5-inch rounds.

===Landing===

The majority of the ships for the assault of Tinian were loaded at Tanapag Harbor on Saipan by troops of the Saipan Island Command. Ten preloaded tank landing ships (LSTs) with three and a half days&#x27; supply of water, rations, medical supplies and ammunition on their top decks were allocated to each division and eight to the NTLF. Fourteen pontoon barges were loaded with drums of fuel and towed to positions off the reef to supply fuel to amphibious vehicles and landing craft. After the initial landing, loaded trucks and trailers were embarked on landing craft, which shuttled them to Tinian where they unloaded at dumps and then returned on landing craft. Twenty landing craft mechanized (LCMs), ten landing craft tank (LCTs) and eight LSTs were assigned to this role, along with 88 2½-ton 6×6 trucks and 25 trailers.

Marine divisions each had two battalions of 75 mm pack howitzers and two of 105 mm howitzers. The latter remained behind on Saipan, but the 4th Marine Division was given the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 10th Marines, so it had four battalions of 75 mm pack howitzers. Two amphibious truck (DUKW) companies were assigned to move them ashore quickly. Each battalion was carried in an LST. Tanks were loaded onto LCMs. Eighteen of the LCMs, each carrying one tank, were each embarked on the dock landing ships (LSDs) and . Another ten tank-carrying LCMs sailed to Tinian under their own power.
The marines left their packs behind on Saipan and landed with coveralls, M1 helmets with camouflage covers, weapons, emergency rations, a spoon, a spare pair of socks, a poncho and insect repellent. The assault troops were carried ashore in the 415 amphibious tractors (LVTs) of the Marine Corps&#x27;s 2nd, 5th and 10th Amphibian Tractor Battalions and the Army&#x27;s 534th, 715th and 773rd Amphibian Tractor Battalions. Fire support was provided by the Company D of the 2nd Armored Amphibian Battalion; only one company could be employed due to the narrowness of the beaches. The shore party for White Beach 1 was provided by the Army&#x27;s 1341st Engineer Combat Battalion and that of White Beach 2 by the 2nd Battalion, 20th Marines.

Captain Paul J. Halloran, the NTLF Construction Officer, designed a landing ramp that could be carried by an LVT. This creation was named a &quot;Doodlebug&quot;. The Doodlebugs allowed vehicles to scale the low cliffs around the White Beaches. The Doodlebug drove up to the cliff face, firmly attached hooks to the cliff tops and then backed away from under the ramps, leaving them in place, with the other end falling into the water. The ramp crews checked that the ramps were firmly anchored and then the Doodlebugs drove over them to the top of the cliffs. The ramps were strong enough to hold the weight of a medium tank. Ten were built, of which six were used in the assault, carried to Tinian by &quot;Ashland&quot;.
Cates assigned the 24th Marines to land on White Beach 1 one battalion at a time, starting with the 2nd Battalion, while the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 25th Marines landed on White Beach 2. The 23rd Marines was in reserve. The first wave of LVTs, consisting of eight LVTs for White Beach 1 and sixteen for White Beach 2, left the line of departure at 07:17 followed at close intervals by fourteen more waves. Eight LVTs carried a rifle company of about 200 men. No more than four LVTs could beach at the one time on White Beach 1, so the other four nosed up against the coral cliffs and the marines clambered over them. Company E of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Marines, was first ashore there. It was opposed by a small number of Japanese defenders in crevices and a cave, who were eliminated after a brief action, allowing the rest of the 2nd Battalion and the shore party of the 1341st Engineer Battalion to land unopposed.

Two pillboxes guarded White Beach 2, which were bypassed by the first waves, but reduced by later ones; fifty dead Japanese were found inside. Both beaches had mines; none exploded on White Beach 1, where they had been allowed to deteriorate, but the area around White Beach 2 was sown with anti-boat mines on the beach and anti-personnel mines ashore, which the underwater demolition teams (UDTs), bomb disposal teams and engineers took until 13:37 to clear. Three LVTs were disabled by mines when they ventured inland from White Beach 2. The 4th Tank Battalion had trouble negotiating the reefs, potholes and mines on White Beach 2 and was diverted to White Beach 1. Despite its small size, nearly all vehicles were landed over White Beach 1. This included the M3 Stuart light tanks of Company D with Ronson flamethrowers. In the afternoon, Company A came ashore on White Beach 2 without mishap.

All three assault battalions were ashore by 08:20. On White Beach 1 the 2nd Battalion, 24th Marines, was followed by the 1st Battalion, which was ashore by 08:46, and the 3rd Battalion at 09:25. On White Beach 2, the reserve battalion, the 1st Battalion, 25th Marines, was ashore by 09:30. DUKWs carrying the artillery began landing at 13:15, the 23rd Marines at 14:00, and the 2nd Marine Division&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, at 17:00. The planned beachhead was occupied, and the marines strung barbed wire and established fields of fire in anticipation of a Japanese counterattack. Two pontoon causeway piers were placed during the night, allowing loaded trucks to come ashore from LSTs. By the evening, 15,614 marines, soldiers and sailors had landed on Tinian, at a cost of 15 men killed and 225 wounded.

===Counterattack===

Ogata immediately attempted to organized a counterattack, in keeping with Japanese doctrine at the time of repulsing the attack on the beach. The 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment, was already in the vicinity of the American beachhead, and was able to probe the hastily-positioned defenses for weaknesses. The 2nd Battalion in the Asiga Bay area was not far away, but could not move until dark, when American aircraft were not in the sky. Izumi&#x27;s mobile counterattack force was ordered forward from its assembly position in the Mapo area. He moved along the side of the roads, where trees offered concealment from the air, and was only spotted from the air once. Ogata kept the 3rd Battalion in place at Tinian Town in case the Americans made a follow-up landing there. Naval troops approached the beachhead from the Ushi Point airfield.
At around 02:00 on 25 July, a force of about 600 Japanese sailors encountered the 1st Battalion, 24th Marines, on the left of the American beachhead, and charged into machine gun, mortar, rifle and 37 mm antitank gun canister shot fire. A furious fight ensued, in which Company A was reduced to just 30 men, but by 07:00 476 Japanese lay dead.

In the center of the American line another attack developed at the boundary between the 24th and 25th Marines. About 200 Japanese soldiers broke through the lines of Company K, 25th Marines, and divided into two groups. One group attacked Battery D, 14th Marines. The attack was halted with the help of Browning .50 caliber machine gun fire from Batteries E and F. Company C of the 8th Marines was sent to their aid, but found the situation in hand. About 100 dead Japanese were found in the area; two men of Battery D were killed. The other group was engaged in a wooded area by 60 mm mortars. The attack in the center cost the Japanese about 500 dead, most of whom were from the 1st Battalion, 135th Infantry Regiment. Many were caught on the barbed wire and killed by machine gun fire.

On the right, the 23rd Marines were attacked by five or six Japanese tanks, accompanied by infantry of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 50th Infantry Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, 135th Infantry Regiment. The moonless night was lit up by Navy star shells. Five Japanese tanks were knocked out by bazookas, 75 mm halftracks and 37 mm antitank guns. The Japanese infantry charged the lines of the 2nd battalion, 23rd Marines, and 2nd Battalion, 25th Marines. Some broke through their lines, only to encounter the 1st Battalion, 23rd Marines. In the morning, 267 Japanese dead were counted in this sector. In all, the counterattack cost Ogata about 1,200 dead.

===Drive south===

The nighttime actions had depleted the 4th Marine Division&#x27;s ammunition, so Cates delayed attacking on 25 July until 10:00 to allow time to replenish. In the meantime, the rest of the 2nd Marine Division began landing. As they moved north along the coast through terrain characterized by coral rocks and thick undergrowth, the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, was held up by a force of 20 to 25 Japanese that it took until 11:30 to overcome. On their right, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines, reached the Ushi Point airfield, and the 24th Marines reached airfield No. 3. The 25th Marines was confronted by the most formidable obstacle of the day, Mount Maga, which was captured with a double envelopment.

The following day, the 25th Marines captured the steeper and more imposing Mount Lasso without opposition, as the Japanese had pulled out during the night. The advance had now begun to outrun the range of the artillery on Saipan, so the 105 mm howitzer battalions of the 10th and 14th Marines displaced to Tinian on 26 and 27 July and rejoined their divisions. The marines pressed forward on 27 and 28 July against sporadic Japanese resistance.

===Weather breaks===

The weather abruptly worsened on the afternoon of 28 July. A typhoon in the Philippine Sea caused heavy swells. At 18:00 all unloading ceased. ran aground on the reef, and efforts to refloat her were unsuccessful. On 13 August, she was pulled off the reef and towed to Tanapag Harbor, where she was beached. A control craft, &quot;LCC-25473&quot;, was washed up on the reef at White Beach 1, but was salvaged the following day. The pontoon causeways were damaged on the night of 29 July. The one at White Beach 1 broached and the one at White Beach 2 broke in two. The White Beach 1 causeway was restored to service on 31 July, only to broach again.

With the Ushi Point airfield in American hands, the 121st Naval Construction Battalion commenced its repair on 27 July, filling in the bomb and shell craters. By that evening, an airstrip long and wide was ready for use, and it was fully restored to its length the next day. On 29 July, a P-47 landed and took off again. Hill summoned the 9th Troop Carrier Squadron from Eniwetok and its Douglas C-47 Skytrains, together with the Curtiss C-46 Commandos of VMR-252, delivered 33,000 rations from Saipan on 31 July. On the return trip they carried wounded. A parachute drop of of supplies was prepared, but was not necessary.

The rough seas precluded unloading to all but DUKWs. These were the preferred transport for supplies, as they did not damage the roads like the LVTs did. In some places engineers constructed parallel roads for LVTs. One important task for the DUKWs was hauling ammunition from the ammunition ships , which arrived off Tinian on 26 July, and , which arrived the following day. The DUKWs also had to haul 600 to 800 drums of fuel each day from the floating barges. A gasoline shortage was averted by the capture of Japanese stocks.

On 30 July the 24th Marines occupied Tinian Town and the 25th Marines overran airfield no. 4. The land mines were cleared away, and LCTs began landing on Green Beach. The water off the south pier was not deep enough to allow LSTs to dock there, so pontoon causeways were brought from White Beach 1 and Saipan, allowing the first LST to dock on 4 August. The beach between the two piers was cleared of land mines by 5 August, and was resurfaced with coral, allowing up to fifteen LCMs to beach there simultaneously. The harbor had not been mined, but there were sunken wrecks, which the UDTs demolished.

===Tinian taken===

Japanese remnants made a final stand in the caves and ravines of a limestone ridge on the south portion of the island, where the terrain rose in a brush and rock strewn plateau long and wide. On the evening of 30 July, Schmidt ordered his divisions to occupy the coastline between Lalo and Mapo Points, and annihilate the remaining Japanese forces. The next morning, the battleships &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot; and the cruisers &quot;Louisville&quot;, &quot;Montpelier&quot; and &quot;Birmingham&quot; unleashed of shells on the plateau, and aircraft dropped of bombs. As they advanced, the marines encountered civilians waving white cloths, who had to be approached with care, as sometimes one of their number turned out to be a Japanese soldier intent on suicide and taking some Americans with him. Kakuta sent his last radio message to Tokyo that day. It is not known whether he was killed in action or committed suicide; neither his body nor that of Oie was ever found.

The rugged terrain hampered the tanks but the flamethrower tanks of Company D, 4th Tank Battalion, were adept at burning sections of undergrowth where Japanese soldiers tried to hide. As the 23rd Marines approached the plateau, they came under intense small arms fire from a small village and the cliff face. The accompanying tanks of Company C, 4th Tank Battalion, were engaged by a concealed Japanese 47 mm antitank gun, which scored six hits on one tank. Although penetrated, the tank remained operational and was able to back away. It used smoke to mark the suspected location of the gun for rockets and naval and tank gunfire. The advance resumed, only to have another tank hit by the same gun. Although also penetrated, it too remained operational, and this time the target was spotted, and engaged by tanks that destroyed the gun and machine-gunned twenty Japanese crewmen who tried to escape.
Meanwhile, the 8th Marines made their way onto the plateau, where vegetation covered caves and fissures where Japanese riflemen and machine gunners lurked. While the vegetation concealed them from observation by the Americans, it also restricted their own fields of view. There was one winding road to the top, but it was mined. Engineers removed the mines, allowing tanks to proceed up the road and destroy Japanese positions, while the accompanying infantry battled their way through the brush. At 16:50, Company A reached the top. Five minutes later they were joined by a platoon from Company C. Company E, following up the road, was attacked by between 75 and 100 Japanese, who were eventually repelled. It then made its way to the top. Company G followed, reaching the top at 18:45, which was sunset. During the night, the Japanese attempted to cut off the Americans on the summit. They captured some vehicles, but were unsuccessful. At 05:15 the marines&#x27; positions were attacked by more than 600 Japanese soldiers and sailors. An hour later, the 8th Marines had 74 casualties and 200 Japanese were dead. The rest withdrew to the woods and cliffs in the southwest of the island.

Lolo Point, the southernmost tip of the island, was reached at 18:00 on 1 August, and 55 minutes later, Schmidt declared that organized resistance had ended, and the island was secure. Nonetheless, that night, the 6th Marines were attacked by a poorly-coordinated force of about 150 Japanese soldiers and sailors. According to Japanese prisoners, Ogata had burned the regimental colors and gathered as many men as he could for a counterattack. The following morning 124 Japanese dead were counted, many of whom had died by their own hand, but Ogata&#x27;s body was never identified.

===Casualties===

In his report on the Tinian operation, Turner reported the 2nd Marine Division&#x27;s losses in the period from 24 July to 9 August as 104 killed, 654 wounded and 3 missing, a total of 761. The 4th Marine Division lost 182 killed, 844 wounded and 20 missing, a total of 1,046. Four men of the XXIV Corps Artillery were wounded, and there were 4 killed, 13 wounded and 1 missing among the V Amphibious Corps troops, for a total of 290 killed, 1,515 wounded and 24 missing, giving a grand total of 1,829 casualties. Another 63 sailors and marines were killed and 177 wounded aboard ships. The dead included two men who were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for using their bodies to protect their comrades from hand grenades: Private Joseph W. Ozbourn and Private First Class Robert L. Wilson.

By 10 August, Japanese casualties included 404 taken prisoner and 5,745 dead that were buried by the Americans.

===Analysis===
Smith considered Tinian &quot;the perfect amphibious operation in the Pacific war.&quot; It differed from most in that the proximity of Saipan allowed it to be carried out as a shore-to-shore operation rather than a ship-to-shore one, and fire support was available from land-based artillery. The operation was much less difficult than Saipan; the nearest base was just away, not over a thousand; the garrison was smaller; the ratio of attackers to defenders was greater; the terrain was less formidable; intelligence was more accurate; and the preliminary naval and aerial bombardment more protracted.
The Battle of Tinian offered a rare example of a force that expected to be attacked still being taken by surprise. &quot;Our singular success at Tinian&quot;, Smith later wrote, &quot;lay in the boldness of the landing.&quot; The Americans had accurate intelligence, assembled from multiple sources, and knew that the Japanese would not be waiting for them on the White Beaches. Aerial photography of Saipan was restricted through fear that the Japanese would be alerted and the element of surprise would be lost; whereas aerial photography of Tinian was unrestricted but surprise was not sacrificed.

American commanders gambled on good weather, but when the weather eventually broke, the American logistical system still held. DUKWs were still able to operate when landing craft could not, and Hill recommended that DUKWs replace LCVPs on the Navy&#x27;s attack cargo ships. Additional supply capability was available by air, although it was not needed.

For their part, the Japanese incurred high casualties in fruitless counterattacks that were defeated by American firepower. They managed to move undetected at night, and were able to withdraw from contact with little loss whenever they wished to do so. Heavier American casualties might have been inflicted by a passive defense, taking advantage of their skill with camouflage, use of terrain, and emplacement of weapons, but this was not Japanese doctrine at the time.

==Aftermath==
===Mopping up===

On 6 August, Brigadier General Merritt A. Edson, the deputy commander of the 2nd Marine Division, assumed tactical responsibility as commander of Ground Forces Tinian. The 8th Marines assumed responsibility for the whole 2nd Marine Division&#x27;s sector two days later, allowing the rest of the division to return to Saipan for rest and reorganization. On 10 August it took over the 4th Marine Division&#x27;s sector as well, so it could return to Hawaii. Major General James L. Underhill was appointed Island Commander on 1 August 1944. Nine days later, all forces on Tinian were transferred to his command. He was succeeded by Brigadier General Frederick V. H. Kimble on 28 November.

The 8th Marines patroled the island, mopping up Japanese holdouts. On 25 October, the 8th Marines joined the rest of the 2nd Marine Division on Saipan, leaving the 1st Battalion behind on Tinian. It continued mopping up patrols until 1 January 1945, when it too departed for Saipan. Between 1 August 1944 and 1 January 1945, the 8th Marines lost another 38 killed and 125 wounded; 542 Japanese soldiers were killed. Responsibility for the defence of Tinian was handed over to the marines of the 16th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion. It departed for Okinawa in April 1945, but the 17th and 18th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalions remained to defend the airbases.

The garrison on Aguiguan Island off the southwest cape of Tinian, commanded by Second Lieutenant Kinichi Yamada, held out until the end of the war, surrendering to Rear Admiral Marshall R. Greer on the United States Coast Guard Cutter &quot;USCG 83525&quot; on 4 September 1945. The entire garrison of 67 troops, along with 172 Japanese and 128 Korean civilians, were interned on Tinian. The last holdout on Tinian, Murata Susumu, was captured in 1953 and repatriated to Japan.

===Military government===
There were 16,029 civilians on Tinian on 15 April 1944, of whom 1,658, mostly women, children and the elderly, were evacuated to Japan before the American invasion. An estimated 2,610 civilians died in the battle. Journalist Robert Sherrod noted that most died as a result of the fighting; the Americans made great use of artillery, aerial and naval bombardment, and civilians often sheltered with soldiers. Some died from disease, dehydration or malnutrition. Some were murdered by Japanese soldiers. In one instance Japanese soldiers tied 40 to 50 civilians together and threw a grenade at them. There were instances of mass suicide, most notably by jumping off the &quot;Suicide Cliff&quot; between Mapo and Lalo Points. Children were thrown off the cliff by their parents, and some civilians were pushed off the cliff by Japanese soldiers. A captured Japanese soldier claimed that a thousand loyal citizens had allowed the military to blow them up in caves.
Only 2,468 civilians had been accounted for by 1 August, but within three days that number had increased to 8,491. The 2nd Marine Division established a stockade for civilians at the Ushi Point Airfield while the 4th Marine Division established one on the site of the ruined village of Churo. The latter was chosen as a permanent camp site, and all the civilians were subsequently concentrated there. By 15 October, there were 10,926 civilians at Camp Churo, of whom 8,625 were Japanese, 2,297 were Koreans, and 4 were Chinese. Nearly half were children under the age of 15.

The military government was unprepared to care for the large number of civilians, and there were critical shortages of relief supplies of all kinds. Seabees supervised the erection of tarpaulin shelters. These were gradually replaced by huts made from corrugated iron and timber salvaged from around the island. The internees also salvaged food supplies, and cultivated gardens. When firewood started to become scarce, Seabees made them improvised diesel stoves.

In late 1945, Spruance, who had succeeded Nimitz as CINCPOA, ordered the repatriation of all Japanese and Korean civilians. This was completed by late 1946.

===Base development===
Responsibility for the transformation of Tinian into a base for B-29 bombers was assigned to the 6th Naval Construction Brigade, under Halloran&#x27;s command. For this work his brigade had the 29th and 30th Naval Construction Regiments; a third regiment, the 49th Naval Construction Regiment, arrived in March 1945. Two air bases were constructed, North Field and West Field. These were on the site of the existing Japanese fields at Ushi Point and Gurguan Point respectively, but they had to be lengthened to and widened to to handle the B-29s. This task would have been easier if the plateau had been more than wide. As it was, large amounts of fill were required.

When work was completed on 5 May 1945, North Field had four parallel runways, with of taxiways, 265 hardstands, 173 Quonset huts and 92 other buildings. Its construction involved of excavations and of fill. West Field had two B-29 runways, of taxiways, 220 hardstands and 251 administration, maintenance and repair buildings. The adjacent base for naval aircraft had of taxiways, 70 hardstands, 345 Quonset huts, 33 administration, maintenance and repair buildings, and a tall control tower.
Initially, fuel had to be supplied in drums. Later, aviation gasoline was drawn from a barge anchored in Tinian Harbor. The fuel storage and distribution system was completed by 8 March 1945. This included storage tanks for of diesel oil, of motor gasoline and of aviation gasoline. Fuel was pumped over a submarine pipeline from an oil tanker moored north of Tinian Harbor and distributed over of pipeline. Work on the harbor included dredging operations and the construction of a breakwater and quays for Liberty ships. Until it was completed in March 1945, cargo was brought ashore by LCMs and LCTs.

North Field became operational in February 1945 and West Field the following month. The 313th Bombardment Wing arrived from the United States in December 1944 and was based at North Field. The 58th Bombardment Wing arrived from the China-Burma-India Theater in March 1945 and was based at West Field. A third formation, the 509th Composite Group arrived in May 1945 and moved to North Field, where it took over an area that had been specially constructed for it. Thus, two of the five bombardment wings of the Twentieth Air Force were based on Tinian. These formations participated in the campaign of air raids on Japan, including the bombing of Tokyo on 10 March 1945, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945.

<doc id="1129944" wikidata="Q9304410" url="?curid=1129944" title="Vienna (Ultravox song)">
<text>&quot;Vienna&quot; is a song by British new wave band Ultravox, released on 9 January 1981 by Chrysalis Records as the third single and the title track from their fourth studio album of the same name. The new wave ballad, which features Midge Ure on lead vocals, is regarded as a staple of the synth-pop genre that was popularised in the early 1980s, and remains both the band&#x27;s signature song and their most commercially successful release.

The song was also performed at the 1985 Live Aid concert in Wembley Stadium, and is often performed live by Ure in solo performances.

==Background==
Written in January 1980, &quot;Vienna&quot; has a dramatic grand piano in the verses and chorus, and a viola solo in the middle of the song. Other sounds include a solid synth bass line played on a MiniMoog, an Elka string synthesiser and a Roland CR-78 drum machine. The drum machine pattern created by Warren Cann was the basis of the song. Cann and the classically trained Billy Currie together wanted to create something that might sound like it had been written by a late-19th-century romantic composer, so they started creating the basic chords and sounds of the song, and the romantic viola solo was influenced by German composer Max Reger. 

The lyrics, which describe a brief love affair in the city of Vienna, were quickly written by Midge Ure. According to Currie, Ure was hesitant about the overly classical romantic feel of the orchestration, and said: &quot;This means nothing to me&quot;, to which the producer Conny Plank replied: &quot;Well, sing that then.&quot; Ure said that, when he went into the studio, he had in his mind only the line &quot;The feeling is gone, this means nothing to me – oh Vienna!&quot;. Then he wrote the vocal part while bass player Chris Cross started playing some bass lines with his synthesizer.

In interviews at the time it was said that the song took its inspiration from the 1949 film &quot;The Third Man&quot;, which is based around the Austrian capital, but Midge Ure later admitted he made that up when asked what the song was about. Ure is said to have been influenced by the Walker Brothers&#x27; 1978 single &quot;The Electrician&quot;. According to Ure&#x27;s autobiography, the title came about by a mishearing of the Fleetwood Mac song &quot;Rhiannon&quot;.

Ure said of the track: &quot;We wanted to take the song and make it incredibly pompous in the middle, leaving it very sparse before and after, but finishing with a typically over-the top classical ending.&quot;

The band&#x27;s record company Chrysalis Records was reluctant to release &quot;Vienna&quot; as a single, thinking the song too slow and too long to be successful, but relented after the band persisted.

==Release and chart performance==
The single spent four consecutive weeks at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, kept off the top spot by John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Woman&quot; for a week and then by Joe Dolce&#x27;s &quot;Shaddap You Face&quot; for a further three weeks. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in February 1981, denoting sales of over 500,000 copies in the UK, and eventually became the UK&#x27;s sixth-best-selling single of 1981. The single topped the charts in Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands.

It was voted Britain&#x27;s favourite single ever to peak at No. 2 on the charts in a 2012 poll by BBC Radio 2 and the Official Charts Company (OCC), and was also awarded an honorary No. 1 by the OCC.

In 2017, Ure declined an opportunity to meet Dolce, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve had 40 years of people talking about Joe &#x27;Bloody&#x27; Dolce and I don&#x27;t want to spend what I&#x27;ve got left talking about when I met him.&quot;

==Music video==

The music video, directed by Russell Mulcahy, is particularly evocative of &quot;The Third Man&quot;. It was Ultravox&#x27;s second video, after &quot;Passing Strangers&quot; (also with Mulcahy), and cost £6,000–£7,000, footed by the band after Chrysalis refused to fund it.

The gravestone that is shown in the video and on the single cover is part of the grave of the Austrian piano manufacturer Carl Schweighofer, and is located in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna. The city&#x27;s cathedral and Michaelerplatz square also feature.

==B-sides==
The B-side to the single is &quot;Passionate Reply&quot;. It was recorded in August 1980 at Criteria Studios in Miami, on their American tour. Cann said to Jonas Wårstad about the track: &quot;The B-side of the 7&quot;, &#x27;Passionate Reply&#x27; was a promising song, perhaps it needed some &#x27;living with&#x27; before we would&#x27;ve considered it finished. As it was, we thought it made a good B-side.&quot; 

The 12-inch single includes &quot;Herr X&quot;, a version of the Kraftwerk-esque album track &quot;Mr. X&quot; sung entirely in German by Warren Cann with the aid of native German producer Conny Plank. Both tracks were included on the remastered CD version of the &quot;Vienna&quot; album as bonus tracks.

==Reissue==
In 1993 &quot;Vienna&quot; was re-released by Chrysalis, to promote the Midge Ure/Ultravox greatest hits compilation &quot;If I Was: The Very Best of Midge Ure &amp; Ultravox&quot;. This reissue peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. Like the compilation album, the single also included songs by Midge Ure (as B-sides).

In March 1992, a re-recorded version of &quot;Vienna&quot;, by a new Ultravox line-up, was released as a single in Germany. This line-up consisted of original Ultravox member Billy Currie on keyboards, violin and percussion, and Tony Fenelle on vocals, guitar and percussion. The backing vocals on B-side &quot;Systems of Love&quot; were performed by Alison Limerick and Jackie Williams. The single did not chart. It was not included in the album &quot;Revelation&quot;.

In 1992, comedian Vic Reeves (Jim Moir) appeared on the album &quot;Ruby Trax – The NME&#x27;s Roaring Forty&quot;, singing a version of the song with different lyrics in the verses. The compilation was released by &quot;NME&quot;, a magazine that had been publishing single charts since 1952, with all records covered having reached the number-one slot in their own charts during 40 years of publication. As &quot;Vienna&quot; by Ultravox reached number one on the &quot;NME&quot; charts on 21 February 1981 (staying at the top for one week) it was eligible for inclusion within the concept of the project, where it would not have been allowed if &quot;NME&quot; had been following the British Market Research Bureau/Gallup chart (now branded as the Official Chart).

<text>USS &quot;Boarfish&quot; (SS-327), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the boarfish, a fish having a projecting hog-like snout.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Boarfish&quot; (SS-327) was laid down on 12 August 1943; launched on 21 May 1944 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut, sponsored by Miss Barbara Walsh, daughter of Senator Arthur Walsh of New Jersey; and commissioned on 23 September 1944, Commander Royce L. Gross in command.

== World War II ==

Following shakedown training off the coast of New England, the submarine departed New London, Conn. on 29 October 1944 for Panama. After a week of intensive training in Panamanian waters, &quot;Boarfish&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 21 November and set out for Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 2 December. Another three weeks of training in Hawaii followed, and then &quot;Boarfish&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on 24 December bound for the western Pacific. She refueled and took on provisions at Saipan before embarking upon her first war patrol on 5 January 1945.

&quot;Boarfish&quot; sailed to the South China Sea to patrol the coast of French Indochina. Early on 21 January, the submarine&#x27;s radar picked up a small convoy of five or six small ships. &quot;Boarfish&quot; closed the convoy three times in three hours, firing 16 torpedoes, all of which apparently passed under the targets. She broke off the attack at daybreak and did not regain contact. On 31 January, the boat made another radar contact on two cargo ships under escort. During &quot;Boarfish&quot;&#x27;s initial approach, an escort sighted the submarine and chased her away. The boat then fired her torpedoes at periscope depth and scored hits on both ships. When &quot;Boarfish&quot; submerged to avoid the escorts, she left &quot;Enki Maru&quot; (6,968 tons) sinking and &quot;Taietsu Maru&quot; (6,890 tons) burning fiercely and beached nearby. Even while avoiding depth charges, &quot;Boarfish&quot; tried to close the beach to finish the job. She abandoned the attempt after 36 hours because fire had so ravaged the cargo ship that she seemed unsalvageable. &quot;Taietsu Maru&quot; was destroyed completely by American planes of the 14th Air Force later that same day, and &quot;Boarfish&quot; received partial credit for the sinking. The submarine ended her first patrol on 15 February when she pulled into Fremantle, Australia, for refit alongside submarine tender .

The submarine&#x27;s second patrol began on 11 March 1945 when she departed Fremantle for a second tour of duty in the South China Sea. Although she encountered and attacked two small convoys, their alert escorts foiled both attacks. &quot;Boarfish&quot; successfully carried out two reconnaissance missions along the east coast of French Indochina before ending her patrol in Subic Bay on 21 April.

After refit alongside , &quot;Boarfish&quot; left Subic Bay on 16 May for the Java Sea. Her first action came when she sighted a small two-masted junk on 27 May. A boarding party searched the junk for arms, contraband, and Japanese, but found nothing, and the junk was allowed to proceed. Two days later, a small convoy of three ships accompanied by two escorts crossed &quot;Boarfish&quot;&#x27;s path. She launched four torpedoes at the lead ship before losing firing position. Her crew heard an explosion; but, when the officer at the conn peered through her periscope, he saw a charging escort instead of a sinking ship. The submarine dived, intending to put of the charted at that location between her and the escort. At , the submarine grounded, knocking off her sound gear and making enough noise to betray her position easily. Eight depth charges followed as &quot;Boarfish&quot; tried to free herself. Despite damage to her port propeller, the submarine backed off the seamount and eased up to to escape. The damage sustained in the grounding was severe enough to force an early return to Fremantle, where she arrived on 8 June.

After repair and refit alongside , she departed on 5 July for her fourth war patrol. Operating in a coordinated attack group &quot;Boarfish&quot;, , and covered the Java Sea off Java and the north coast of Bali. They made no surface contacts but encountered a number of enemy planes, one of which depth-bombed &quot;Boarfish&quot; on 8 July. On the 29th, &quot;Boarfish&quot; performed lifeguard duties during an Allied air strike on Singapore, and she remained off the Malay coast patrolling until 6 August, when she set course for Subic Bay. The submarine pulled alongside for refit on 10 August and was there when the Japanese capitulation was announced.

== 1945–1948 ==

&quot;Boarfish&quot; sailed from Subic Bay on 30 August in company with &quot;Howard W. Gilmore&quot; and 17 submarines. She parted company with them on 5 September and put into Apra Harbor, Guam, where she remained until 17 November training in postwar maneuvers and drills. She got underway on 17 November and set course via Pearl Harbor for San Diego, Calif. where she arrived early in February 1946.

&quot;Boarfish&quot; operated out of San Diego in local training exercises until 9 September, when she got underway for a tour in the western Pacific. After a brief stopover in Pearl Harbor, the submarine got underway on 1 October for a tour that included visits to Midway Island; Marcus Island; Okinawa; Qingdao, China; and Guam. She began her return cruise to San Diego on 11 November and, upon her arrival, resumed local operations.

&quot;Boarfish&quot; remained in the San Diego area until 15 November 1947 except for one cruise to Pearl Harbor in February 1947 and another to Alaska and Canada between July and November. Commencing 30 July 1947 &quot;Boarfish&quot; was the flagship of the first exploration under the Polar Ice Cap in the Bering Strait, this mission designated as Task Group 17.3 Operation Blue Nose under the command of R. Adm. Allan Rockwell McCann for the purpose of testing the under-ice use of Sonar, developed by Dr. Waldo K. Lyon, director of the Arctic Submarine Laboratory, who was also aboard. On 15 November, the submarine entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul before transfer to the Turkish Navy. She left Mare Island on 21 February 1948 and steamed via San Diego, Panama, New London, Malta, and Port Argostoli, Greece, to İzmir, Turkey.

&quot;Boarfish&quot; was struck from the Naval Register on 20 May 1948, and transferred (sold) to Turkey under terms of the Security Assistance Program, 23 August 1948. She was returned to US custody for scrapping, 1 January 1974.

&quot;Boarfish&quot; received one battle star for her service in World War II.

==TCG &quot;Sakarya&quot; (S 332)==
On 23 May 1948, &quot;Boarfish&quot; was decommissioned and immediately recommissioned in the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Sakarya&quot; (S 332), the second submarine named in honor of the 1921 Battle of Sakarya.

<text>Metasomatism (from the Greek μετά &quot;metá&quot; &quot;change&quot; and σῶμα &quot;sôma&quot; &quot;body&quot;) is the chemical alteration of a rock by hydrothermal and other fluids. It is traditionally defined as metamorphism which involves a change in the chemical composition, excluding volatile components. It is the replacement of one rock by another of different mineralogical and chemical composition. The minerals which compose the rocks are dissolved and new mineral formations are deposited in their place. Dissolution and deposition occur simultaneously and the rock remains solid.

Synonyms of the word &quot;metasomatism&quot; are metasomatosis and metasomatic process. The word &quot;metasomatose&quot; can be used as a name for specific varieties of metasomatism (for example &quot;Mg-metasomatose&quot; and &quot;Na-metasomatose&quot;).

Metasomatism can occur via the action of hydrothermal fluids from an igneous or metamorphic source. In the igneous environment, metasomatism produces skarns, greisen, and may affect hornfels in the contact metamorphic aureole adjacent to an intrusive rock mass. In the metamorphic environment, metasomatism is driven by mass transfer from a volume of metamorphic rock at higher stress and temperature into a zone with lower stress and temperature, with metamorphic hydrothermal solutions acting as a solvent. This can be envisaged as the metamorphic rocks within the deep crust losing fluids and dissolved mineral components as hydrous minerals break down, with this fluid percolating up into the shallow levels of the crust to chemically change and alter these rocks.

This mechanism implies that metasomatism is open system behaviour, which is different from classical metamorphism which is the in-situ mineralogical change of a rock without appreciable change in the chemistry of the rock. Because metamorphism usually requires water in order to facilitate metamorphic reactions, metamorphism nearly always occurs with metasomatism.

Further, because metasomatism is a mass transfer process, it is not restricted to the rocks which are changed by addition of chemical elements and minerals or hydrous compounds. In all cases, to produce a metasomatic rock some other rock is also metasomatised, if only by &quot;dehydration&quot; reactions with minimal chemical change. This is best illustrated by gold ore deposits which are the product of focused concentration of fluids derived from many cubic kilometres of dehydrated crust into thin, often highly metasomatised and altered shear zones and lodes. The source region is often largely chemically unaffected compared to the highly hydrated, altered shear zones, but both must have undergone complementary metasomatism.

Metasomatism is more complicated in the Earth&#x27;s mantle, because the composition of peridotite at high temperatures can be changed by infiltration of carbonate and silicate melts and by carbon dioxide-rich and water-rich fluids, as discussed by Luth (2003). Metasomatism is thought to be particularly important in changing the composition of mantle peridotite below island arcs as water is driven out of ocean lithosphere during subduction. Metasomatism has also been considered critical for enriching source regions of some silica-undersaturated magmas. Carbonatite melts are often considered to have been responsible for enrichment of mantle peridotite in incompatible elements.

Metasomatism can be similar to other endogenic processes and is separated by four main features. The first of these is the ion-by-ion replacement in minerals, this can happen from the precipitation of new minerals at the same time as the dissolution of existing minerals. The second feature used to identify metasomatism is that it is from the preservation of rocks in its solid state during replacement. The third distinctive feature is from isochemical metamorphism, or the addition or subtraction of major elements other than water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The last feature is the distinct zones of metasomatism. These are formed from magmatism and metamorphism and form a characteristic pattern of a metasomatic column.

==Types of metasomatites==
Metasomatic rocks can be extremely varied. Often, metasomatised rocks are pervasively but weakly &quot;altered&quot;, such that the only evidence of alteration is bleaching, change in colour or change in the crystallinity of micaceous minerals.

In such cases, characterising alteration often requires microscope investigation of the mineral assemblage of the rocks to characterise the minerals, any additional mineral growth, changes in protolith minerals, and so on.

In some cases, geochemical evidence can be found of metasomatic alteration processes. This is usually in the form of mobile, soluble elements such as barium, strontium, rubidium, calcium and some rare earth elements. However, to characterise the alteration properly, it is necessary to compare altered with unaltered samples.

When the process becomes extremely advanced, typical metasomatites can include:
* Chlorite or mica whole-rock replacement in shear zones, resulting in rocks in which the existing mineralogy has been completely recrystallised and replaced by hydrated minerals such as chlorite, muscovite, and serpentine. 
* Skarn and skarnoid rock types, typically adjacent to granite intrusions and adjacent to reactive lithologies such as limestone, marl and banded iron formation.
* Greisen deposits within granite margins and cupolas.
* Rodingite typical of ophiolites particularly their serpentinized mafic dykes, containing grossular-andradite garnet, calcic pyroxene, vesuvianite, epidote and scapolite.
* Fenite, as a variant of metasomatism associated with strongly alkaline or carbonatitic magmatism introducing a variety of feldspars, sodic pyroxenes or amphiboles and often unusual minerals (such as chevkinite or columbite) comprising ordinarily incompatible elements that do not readily become incorporated into a crystal lattice i.e. niobium, zirconium 
* Albitite, from replacement of plagioclase by albite (albitization)

Effects of metasomatism in mantle peridotite can be either modal or cryptic. In cryptic metasomatism, mineral compositions are changed, or introduced elements are concentrated on grain boundaries and the peridotite mineralogy appears unchanged. In modal metasomatism, new minerals are formed.

Cryptic metasomatism may be caused as rising or percolating melts interact with surrounding peridotite, and compositions of both melts and peridotite are changed. At high mantle temperatures, solid-state diffusion can also be effective in changing rock compositions over tens of centimeters adjacent to melt conduits: gradients in mineral composition adjacent to pyroxenite dikes may preserve evidence of the process.

Modal metasomatism may result in formation of amphibole and phlogopite, and the presence of these minerals in peridotite xenoliths has been considered strong evidence of metasomatic processes in the mantle. Formation of minerals less common in peridotite, such as dolomite, calcite, ilmenite, rutile, and armalcolite, is also attributed to melt or fluid metasomatism.

== Metasomatism schemes ==
There are two main schemes discussed for the manifestation of metasomatism in nature in granitic systems. Diffusion metasomatism, which was mentioned in the types of metasomatites section, and infiltration metasomatism. Infiltration takes place in cracks or fractures that promote fluid flow in areas of high permeability. Diffusion takes place when fluid is incorporated into the pores of the rock, this is determined by the porosity. Rocks altered by infiltration metasomatism will be less altered than rocks altered by diffusion because of the dispersion effects during fluid advection.

These two methods are commonly used for transportation from one region to another. These effected regions can be either enriched or depleted in the components transported relative to the premetasomatic state. Chemical weathering strongly effects the levels and contents of the metasomatic liquid and the major element geochemistry and mineralogy of siliciclastic sediments.

==Alteration assemblages==
Investigation of altered rocks in hydrothermal ore deposits has highlighted several ubiquitous types of &quot;alteration assemblages&quot; which form distinct groups of metasomatic alteration effects, textures, and mineral assemblages.

* &quot;Propylitic alteration&quot; is caused by iron and sulfur-bearing hydrothermal fluids, and typically results in epidote-chlorite-pyrite alteration, often with hematite and magnetite facies.
* &quot;Albite-epidote alteration&quot; is caused by silica-bearing fluids rich in sodium and calcium, and typically results in weak albite-silica-epidote.
* &quot;Potassic alteration&quot;, typical of porphyry copper and lode gold deposits, results in production of micaceous, potassic minerals such as biotite in iron-rich rocks, muscovite mica or sericite in felsic rocks, and orthoclase (adularia) alteration, often quite pervasive and producing distinct salmon-pink alteration vein selvages.
*&quot;Quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration&quot;, in which these minerals can be deposited both in veins and in a disseminated manner; sericite in particular replaces plagioclase and biotite. This is common in porphyry copper and porphyry molybdenum deposits.
*&quot;Argillic alteration&quot;, commonly present in the distal areas of porphyry deposits, is a low-temperature assemblage that converts feldspars and some other minerals into clay minerals such as kaolinite and illite. It can overprint older, higher-temperature alteration assemblages.

Rarer types of hydrothermal fluids may include highly carbonic fluids, resulting in advanced carbonation reactions of the host rock typical of calc-silicates, and silica-hematite fluids resulting in production of jasperoids, manto ore deposits and pervasive zones of silicification, typically in dolomite strata. Stressed minerals and country rocks of granitic plutons are replaced by porphyroblasts of orthoclase and quartz in the Papoose Flat quartz monzonites.

<text>Limp Wrist is an American punk rock band, who formed in 1998. Featuring members of Los Crudos, Hail Mary, Devoid of Faith, By the Throat, and Kill the Man Who Questions, the band plays short, fast hardcore music, and covers themes concerning the gay community in their live performances and lyrics. They are an openly gay band and they identify as part of the &quot;queercore&quot; punk subculture.
 The band declared in &quot;Frontiers&quot; magazine, &quot;We put the &#x27;core&#x27; back in &#x27;Queercore&#x27;&quot;. The band are featured on the cover of &quot;My Brain Hurts&quot;, Liz Baillie&#x27;s comic about queer teenagers in New York City.

After the break up of Los Crudos, Martin Sorrondeguy, and the original guitarist, Mark Telfian, came up with the idea to form a band. They are an openly gay band and they identify as part of the queercore subculture. They then asked the bassist Andrew Martini, and original drummer, Scott Moore, who were living in Philadelphia to join up for a first practice which was held in Philadelphia in late 1998. After a few weekends of practice, a first gig was set up in Philadelphia at Stalag 13 on June 13, 1999. The members have never all lived in the same city and thus play infrequently, except for an occasional tour.

==Background==
Their first recording was the self-released demo &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock It Till You Try It&quot;. This was followed by a single called &quot;What’s Up With The Kids&quot; and then the self-titled LP &quot;Limp Wrist&quot;. However, since band members lived in different states maintaining the group became difficult. After an interlude they resumed touring in 2004 and released a new CD, &quot;Complete Discography&quot; the same year. The song &quot;Ode&quot; from this recording pays tribute to pioneering gay hardcore musicians Gary Floyd of The Dicks, Randy Turner of Big Boys and Joshua Plague of Mukilteo Fairies and Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live, providing a historical context for Limp Wrist.

The band&#x27;s best known song was &quot;I Love Hardcore Boys, I Love Boys Hardcore&quot;, which received much attention from fans and press alike. Lead singer Martin Sorrondeguy appears in &quot;Queercore: A Punk-u-mentary&quot; by Scott Treleaven and addresses the issue implicit in these song titles.

In 2002, &quot;Maximum RockNRoll&quot; featured Martin Sorrondeguy in its &quot;QueerPunk&quot; issue, in discussion with Gary Fembot and Iraya Robles of Sta-Prest, and Aaron Detroit of The Little Deaths.

In 1999, Sorrondeguy released his own documentary film, &quot;Beyond The Screams: A U.S. Latino Hardcore Punk Documentary&quot;. He had begun the film while still a member of his former band Los Crudos.

In 2006, Limp Wrist released the split label 7&quot;, &quot;Want Us Dead&quot; on Cheap Art/Lengua Armada.

In 2009, the band also self-released a 7-song 12&quot; record in the US. The European version of this release, by La Vida Es Un Mus, contains the &quot;Want Us Dead&quot; record on side B.

<text>The Battle of Guam (21 July – 10 August 1944) was the American recapture of the Japanese-held island of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Mariana Islands captured by the Japanese from the United States in the First Battle of Guam in 1941 during the Pacific campaign of World War II. The battle was a critical component of Operation Forager. The recapture of Guam and the broader Mariana and Palau Islands campaign resulted in the destruction of much of Japan&#x27;s naval air power and allowed the United States to establish large airbases from which it could bomb the Japanese home islands with its new strategic bomber, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress.

==Background==
Guam, at 212 square miles (543 square kilometers), is the largest island of the Marianas, with a length of 32 miles (52 km) and a width ranging from 12 miles (19.31 km) to four miles (6.44 km) at different points of the island.It had been a United States possession since its capture from Spain in 1898 until it was captured by the Japanese on 10 December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. During the Japanese occupation of Guam, it was not as heavily fortified as the other Mariana Islands such as Saipan that had been Japanese possessions since the end of World War I. But by 1944, Guam had a large Japanese garrison.

The United States plan for the invasion of the Marianas, Operation Forager, called for heavy preliminary bombardment, first by carrier aircraft and U.S. Army Air Forces bombers based in the Marshall Islands to the east, then once air superiority was gained, close bombardment by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Saipan, Tinian, and Guam were chosen as the targets because of their size and suitability as bases for supporting the next stage of operations toward the Philippines, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. The seaport at Apra Harbor was suitable for the largest ships; and air bases for Boeing B-29 Superfortresses could be built from which to bomb Japan. B-24 Liberators from the Marianas could also bomb Iwo Jima and the Bonin Islands, such as Chichi Jima.

The invasion of Saipan was scheduled for 15 June 1944, with landings on Guam tentatively set for 18 June. The original timetable was optimistic, however. A large Japanese carrier attack and stubborn resistance by the unexpectedly large Japanese garrison on Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being postponed for a month.

U.S. naval and air bombardments lasted from 11 to 13 June 1944, involving 216 carrier aircraft and land-based B-24 bombers from the Marshall Islands. On 12 and 13 June 12 Japanese cargo ships and several fishing vessels were sunk. On 27 June, U.S. Navy battleships and cruisers started shelling the island, joined by a U.S. carrier group on 4 July, and two more on 6 July.

==Battle==

Before landing, U.S. forces sought to ensure both air and naval superiority. A total of 274 ships, which fired 44,978 shots from 2-inch and 5-inch guns, supported the landing. In addition, 13 aircraft carriers participated in the air raid, and 4,283 bombs (weighing a total of 1,310 tons) were dropped from 18 to 20 July, the day before the landings. The heavy bombardment burned all the palm trees on the beach and destroyed every building that could be seen. Experience gained by the Japanese from the invasion of Saipan was used to try to mitigate the effects of the bombardment. Despite this, the bombardment far exceeded the expectations of the defending forces which were dug in along the coast as they were on Saipan. Many of the bases and guard towers were destroyed. However, artillery pieces entrenched in dense forests, caves, trenches and locations four kilometers or more from the coast were able to escape destruction and became a source of heavy Japanese resistance. Guam, ringed by reefs, cliffs, and heavy surf, presents a formidable challenge for any attacker. Underwater Demolition Teams reconnoitered the beaches and removed obstacles from 14 to 17 July.

Despite the obstacles, on 21 July the American forces landed on both sides of the Orote Peninsula on the western side of Guam, planning to secure Apra Harbor. The 3rd Marine Division landed at Asan near Agana to the north of Orote at 08:29, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near Agat to the south. Japanese artillery sank 30 U.S. LVTs and inflicted heavy casualties on the landing troops, especially of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, but by 09:00 Marines and tanks were ashore at both beaches.

By nightfall, the Marines and soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division had established beachheads about deep. The 77th Infantry Division had a more difficult landing on 23–24 July. Lacking amphibious vehicles, they had to wade ashore from the edge of the reef where the landing craft dropped them off. The men stationed in the two beachheads were pinned down by heavy Japanese fire, making initial progress inland quite slow. Supply was very difficult for the landing troops on Guam in the first days of the battle. Landing ships could not come closer than the reef, several hundred yards from the beach, and amphibious vehicles were scarce.

The 1st Provisional Brigade blocked off the Orote Peninsula on 25 July, and that same night Takashina counterattacked, coordinated with a similar attack against the 3rd Division to the north. The next day, Obata reported, &quot;our forces failed to achieve the desired objectives.&quot; Takashina was killed on 28 July, and Obata took over command. On 28 July the two beachheads were linked, and by 29 July, the Americans secured the peninsula.

The Japanese counterattacks against the American beachheads, as well as the fierce fighting, had exhausted the Japanese. At the start of August, they were running out of food and ammunition, and they had only a handful of tanks left. Obata withdrew his troops from southern Guam, planning to make a stand in the mountainous central and northern part of the island, &quot;to engage in delaying action in the jungle in northern Guam to hold the island as long as possible&quot;.

After ensuring that no significant Japanese forces operated in the southern portion of Guam, Marine Major General Roy S. Geiger started an offensive north with the 3rd Marine Division on the left flank and the 77th Infantry Division on the right, liberating Agana on the same day. The Tiyan Airfield was captured on 1 August.

Rain and thick jungle made conditions difficult for the Americans, but after an engagement with the main Japanese line of defense around Mount Barrigada from 2 to 4 August, the Japanese line collapsed. The 1st Provisional Brigade formed up on the left flank of the 3rd Marine Division on 7 August because of the widening front and continued casualties, in an effort to prevent the Japanese from slipping through gaps in the line. The Japanese had another stronghold at Mount Santa Rosa, which was secured on 8 August.

On 10 August organized Japanese resistance ended, and Guam was declared secure, but 7,500 Japanese soldiers were estimated to be at large. The next day, Obata committed ritual suicide at his headquarters on Mount Mataguac after he had sent a farewell message to Japan.

==Aftermath==

A few Japanese soldiers held out in the jungle after the fighting on Guam. On 8 December 1945, three U.S. Marines were ambushed and killed. Sergeant Masashi Itō surrendered on 23 May 1960, after the last of his companions was captured. On 24 January 1972, Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi was discovered by hunters on the island. He had lived alone in a cave for 28 years, near Talofofo Falls.

Guam was turned into a base for Allied operations after the battle. Five large airfields were built by the Navy Seabees and African American Aviation Engineering Battalions. Army Air Forces B-29 bombers flew from Northwest Field and North Field on Guam to attack targets in the Western Pacific and on mainland Japan.

Guam&#x27;s native Chamorro population had suffered considerably during Japanese occupation, and the Japanese soldiers began to commit atrocities during the preparation for the invasion. In what became known as the Maneggon March, the Japanese soldiers forced most of the island&#x27;s population to march into six concentration camps in southern Guam. The sick and starving were left for dead along the way, and Japanese troops massacred about 600 civilians. As many as 2,000 may have been killed during the occupation. Liberation Day continues to be celebrated on Guam every 21 July.

<text>A terminal node controller (TNC) is a device used by amateur radio operators to participate in AX.25 packet radio networks. It is similar in function to the Packet Assembler/Disassemblers used on X.25 networks, with the addition of a modem to convert baseband digital signals to audio tones.

The first TNC, the VADCG board, was originally developed by Doug Lockhart, VE7APU, of Vancouver, British Columbia.

Amateur Radio TNCs were first developed in 1978 in Canada by the Montreal Amateur Radio Club and the Vancouver Area Digital Communications group. These never gained much popularity because only a bare printed circuit board was made available and builders had to gather up a large number of components.
In 1983, the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (TAPR) association produced complete kits for their TNC-1 design. This was later available as the Heathkit HD-4040. A few years later, the improved TNC-2 became available, and it was licensed to commercial manufacturers such as MFJ.

In 1986, the improved &quot;TNC+&quot; was designed to run programs and protocols developed for the original TNC board.
TNC+ also included an assembler and a version of Forth (STOIC), which runs on the TNC+ itself, to support developing new programs and protocols.

In 2018 Nino Carillo (KK4HEJ) developed and produced a TNC (the &quot;NinoTNC&quot;) with (currently) 16 different data modes, from 300 baud AFSK to 19,200 C4FSK.It has a KISS interface to the compute device, and implements IL2P (Improved Layer 2 Protocol) for Forward Error Correction (FEC) in some modes.

== Description ==

A typical model consists of a microprocessor, a modem, and software (in EPROM) that implements the AX.25 protocol and provides a command line interface to the user. (Commonly, this software provides other functionality as well, such as a basic bulletin board system to receive messages while the operator is away.) Because the TNC contains all the intelligence needed to communicate over an AX.25 network, no external computer is required. All of the network&#x27;s resources can be accessed using a dumb terminal.

The TNC connects to the terminal and a radio transceiver. Data from the terminal is formatted into AX.25 packets and modulated into audio signals (in traditional applications) for transmission by the radio. Received signals are demodulated, the data unformatted, and the output sent to the terminal for display. In addition to these functions, the TNC manages the radio channel according to guidelines in the AX.25 specification.

Early usage was mostly one-to-one communication, either between two people or a person to an automated Bulletin Board or E-mail system. 

== Current status ==

Since the late 1990s, most AX.25 usage has shifted to a different one-to-many communication paradigm with the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS).

The TNCs of the 1980s and 1990s were complete solutions that only needed a radio and an optional dumb terminal. As home computers made their way into ham &quot;shacks,&quot; there was a movement toward simpler, cheaper &quot;KISS&quot; (Keep It Simple, Stupid) devices. These have a modem and minimal processing of the AX.25 protocol. Most of the processing is moved to the personal computer.

The next logical step in the evolution is to eliminate the specialized hardware and move all of the processing to a computer. A &quot;soundcard&quot; is used for audio to and from the radio. Everything else is done in software.

Some of the earlier attempts performed poorly, giving this approach a bad reputation. Modern software TNCs, using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, can successfully decode poor quality signals that the older equipment can&#x27;t.

Some handheld and mobile VHF radios currently on the market incorporate TNC abilities within the radio itself in support of the APRS protocol.

Many TNCs are still in use, especially in unattended stations where reliability is important. The importance of location to the APRS system has fueled development of a new generation of small low-power TNCs often integrated with a GPS module for use in mobile tracking stations. Not all AX.25 activity is APRS: Some AX.25 data networks exist, including the EastNet Packet Network mostly in the Northeastern United States and TARPN Network mostly in North Carolina. 

APRS digipeating protocols require specific naming conventions, and older TNCs may not have the required support to be used as a digipeater. However, almost any TNC can be pressed into service for Home or Tracker use. TNCs that were clones of the popular TAPR TNC-2 may be upgradeable via the UIDIGI firmware project.

==TNC/Radio data ports==

Although typically described as data ports, the interface between a radio and a TNC is almost entirely analog audio (plus lines for PTT and squelch). The connectors used for this purpose vary widely across TNC manufacturers, but modern radios that offer data ports have widely adopted the Mini-DIN 6-pin connector. 

Also used are full-size DIN connectors, DE-9 (D-sub) connectors, modular telephone (RJ) connectors, and combinations of mini- and micro-headphone connectors (typically on handheld radios).
* 6-pin Mini-DIN

== Terminal data port ==
TNCs were originally designed to accept messages from a human typing on a dumb terminal. TNCs had a DB-25 or DE-9 connector carrying asynchronous start-stop bytes with RS-232 signal levels. This could also be used with the serial port of a personal computer. Serial ports are now pretty much extinct, but USB-to-serial converter cables are available.

However, typically a human uses a more sophisticated software package running on a personal computer that sends messages to the TNC using the KISS (TNC) protocol or the 6PACK protocol.

Modern Software TNCs provide TCP/IP interfaces that can be accessed across computer networks. For example, it is possible to run a software TNC on a Raspberry Pi near the radio and access it from a laptop computer in another location. Software TNCs also provide &quot;pseudo terminals&quot; so they can be used with old applications that only know how to use serial ports.

<doc id="1129969" wikidata="Q1538855" url="?curid=1129969" title="Battle of Angaur">
<text>The Battle of Angaur was a major battle of the Pacific campaign in World War II, fought on the island of Angaur in the Palau Islands from 17 September to 22 October 1944. This battle was part of a larger offensive campaign known as Operation Forager which ran from June to November 1944 in the Pacific Theater of Operations, and Operation Stalemate II in particular.

==Background==
Angaur is a small coral island, just long, separated from Peleliu by a wide strait, from which phosphate was mined. In mid-1944, the Japanese had 1,400 troops on the island, under the overall command of Palau Sector Group commander Lieutenant General Sadae Inoue and under the direct command of Major Ushio Goto who was stationed on the island.

The weak defenses of the Palaus and the potential for airfield construction made them attractive targets for the Americans after the capture of the Marshall Islands, but a shortage of landing craft meant that operations against the Palaus could not begin until the Mariana Islands were secure.

Once the assault on Peleliu was &quot;well in hand&quot;, the 322nd Regimental combat team (RCT) would land on the northern Beach Red, and the 321st RCT on the eastern Beach Blue. Both teams were part of the 81st Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Paul J. Mueller.
The Japanese defending both Peleliu and Angaur, were the combat-hardened men of the 14th Infantry Division with four years of experience fighting in Manchuria behind them, and personally sent to defend the Palaus by Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. The 1,400 soldiers garrisoned on Angaur were the 1st Battalion, 59th Infantry Regiment.

==Battle==

Bombardment of Angaur by the battleship , four cruisers, and 40 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the aircraft carrier began on 11 September 1944. Six days later on 17 September, the two RCTs landed on the northeast and southeast coasts. Not having enough troops to defend all the beaches, Goto selected the most attractive beach (code named Green Beach by the Americans) for an amphibious landing to build his beach defenses. His defenses consisted of a formidable array of pillboxes, blockhouses, trenches and antitank ditches. Seeing the buildup around Green Beach, Mueller decided to land his troops at the more constricted but less defended beaches of Red and Blue Beach. The 322nd RCT received sporadic mortar and machine gun fire, but they landed fairly unopposed and with light casualties. The 321st landing at Blue Beach faced heavier machine gun and mortar fire, but it too was able to get ashore with minimal casualties.

Unbeknownst to them, this was all part of the Japanese new &quot;defense in depth strategy&quot; that they would face, along with the 1st Marine Division on nearby Peleliu. The Japanese strategy had been modified to allow the Americans to land rather unopposed and move inward, with &quot;in depth&quot; defensive lines further inland, and initiating nighttime counterattacks en masse while the Americans were still heavily congregated on the beachheads, attempting to drive them back into the sea. Suicidal banzai charges as seen on Tarawa, Guadalcanal and Saipan were forbidden. Both RCTs were counterattacked during the night but this achieved little more than quickly depleting valuable troops Goto could not replace. Late the next day on 18 September, both RCTs were able to link up and push on to their respective objectives. 

By the end of the third day, 19 September, the RCTs had cut the island in half, with two pockets of resistance. The main Japanese force to the northwest on Ramauldo Hill and the other dug in at the Green Beach defensive fortifications. After two days of harsh fighting and heavy casualties, the 321st had overrun the Green Beach defenses and the 400 dug in soldiers by flanking them from behind. At a cost of 300 casualties, the southern half of the island was declared secure. While the 321st was embattled to the south, the 322nd RCT moved across the island to the western coast securing the only inhabited area of the island, &quot;Saipan Town&quot;, then swept north towards &quot;Shrine Hill&quot; and Romauldo Hill where the main 750-strong force was awaiting them, heavily dug in to the island&#x27;s most formidable and difficult terrain. With the southern half of the island secured, on 23 September the 321st RCT was dispatched to nearby Peleliu, where the 1st Marine Division was taking massive casualties and nearing becoming combat ineffective as a unit. Securing the rest of Angaur fell to the 3,200 men of the 322nd RCT.

The Japanese defensive network on Romauldo Hill and the intense fighting that would take place there was in effect, a microcosm of the brutal fighting taking place in the Umurbrogol pocket on nearby Peleliu by the Marines, and later the 81st Infantry Division. The entire hill was honeycombed with interconnecting caves, pillboxes and bunkers built into the coral rock, forming an almost impregnable position where the defenders were dug in, determined to fight to the death and take as many American lives with them. Near the top of the hill was a small bowl-like valley with a lake surrounded by ridges almost tall, which became known as &quot;the Bowl&quot;. To add to the defenders&#x27; advantage there was only one way into and out of the bowl, through a narrow gorge, later named &quot;Bloody Gulch.&quot; As the 322nd RCT advanced on &quot;the Bowl&quot;, they were met with withering machine gun, mortar and sniper fire, being stymied in their tracks.

From 20 September, the 322nd RCT repeatedly attacked the Bowl, but the dug in defenders repulsed them with artillery, mortars, grenades and machine guns, inflicting heavy losses. Gradually, hunger, thirst and American shellfire and bombing took their toll on the Japanese, and by 25 September, after three costly frontal attacks the Americans had penetrated the Bowl. Rather than fight for possession of the caves, they used bulldozers to seal the entrances. By 30 September the island was said to be secure although the Japanese still had about 300 more soldiers in the Bowl and surrounding areas that held out for almost four more weeks.

Toward the end of the first week of October, the protracted conflict had degenerated into patrol action with sniping, ambushing, and extensive booby-trapping employed by both sides. Goto was killed on 19 October fighting to keep possession of a cave. The last day of fighting was 22 October with a total of 36 days of fighting and blasting the Japanese resistance from their caves with explosives, tanks, artillery and flamethrowers. The 81st Infantry Division had finally taken the whole of Angaur, although at a high cost.

The 322nd RCT sustained 80% of the American casualties on Angaur, with a 47% casualty rate. On Peleliu, men of the 321st and 323rd RCT&#x27;s would go on to fight the remaining 3,600 Japanese defenders holding out in the Umurbrogal pocket for almost two months, often resorting to fierce hand to hand combat. There, another 282 men of the 81st Infantry Division would lose their lives with another 4,409 being wounded. Of all the casualties sustained by the 81st Wildcat Division in Operation Stalemate II, only about 52% would be fit enough to return to duty. A great number of American casualties were the result of head wounds inflicted by accurate Japanese sniper fire and their use of smokeless powder. 
==Aftermath==
Airfields were being constructed as the battle was still being fought, but the delay in the start of the Palaus operation meant that the airfields were not ready in time for the start of the Philippines campaign in October 1944. Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. had argued before the invasion of the Palaus that the operation was unnecessary, and military historians have agreed with him, suggesting that the main benefit was the combat experience gained by the 81st Infantry Division.

During the fighting, Seabees created an airstrip that would house B-24 Liberator bombers of the 494th Bombardment Group, 7th Air Force which engaged in frequent bombings of the Philippines and other Palau Islands.

The 81st Infantry Division moved on directly to the battle on Peleliu to aid the 1st Marine Division, which had encountered extremely stiff resistance in the central highland of that island. They would remain on Peleliu for another month taking the island and mopping-up the remaining Japanese forces.

<text>Hornby Dock was a dock located on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It was situated in the northern dock system in Bootle. It connected to Gladstone Dock to the north and Alexandra Dock to the south and encompassed a sloping quayside.

==History==

The dock was built by George Fosbery Lyster between 1880-3. Opened in 1884, Hornby Dock marked the completion of Liverpool dock system&#x27;s period of expansion in the nineteenth century. The dock was named after Thomas Dyson Hornby, chairman of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board between 1876 and 1889, and was used by the timber trade during its early years. The dock had a lighthouse which, because of its foghorn, was known as the &quot;Bootle Bull&quot;. The lighthouse was demolished in 1928, being replaced by one built north of Gladstone Dock. In 1940, during World War II, the Hornby River Entrance was bombed and very badly damaged, which restricted use of the dock throughout the war. The dock was still receiving significant traffic by 1992, mainly in the form of general cargo and containers, with new quayside sheds being built.

==Present==
Apart from an access channel along the river wall, the dock has been filled in to provide additional space for the coal terminal at Gladstone Dock.

<doc id="1129978" wikidata="Q685156" url="?curid=1129978" title="Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky">
<text>Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky of Woschütz (, also known as &quot;Carl Alois, Fürst von Lichnowsky-Woschütz&quot;; 21 June 1761 – 15 April 1814) was the second Prince Lichnowsky and a chamberlain at the Imperial Austrian court. He is remembered for his patronage of music and his relationships with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven.

==Life==

Karl Alois was born as the eldest son of Prince Friedrich Karl Johann Amadeus von Lichnowsky-Werdenberg (1720-1788) and his wife, Countess Maria Karolina von Althann (1741-1800). Although Lichnowsky spent most of his time in Vienna, it was actually in Prussia that he held the title of Prince. His estates were located in Grätz, in the Austrian part of the historic province of Silesia, most of which was conquered by Prussia earlier in the century. The location is today called Hradec nad Moravicí and is within the borders of the Czech Republic.

In his youth (1776 to 1782) he was a law student, studying in Leipzig and in Göttingen. While in Göttingen he met Johann Nikolaus Forkel, who later was to become famous for writing the first biography of J. S. Bach. Lichnowsky at the time began to collect works by Bach in manuscript copies. He also was a musician and a composer. Karl Alois was a Mason and a lodge brother of Mozart; see Mozart and Freemasonry.

==Private life==
Lichnowsky was married (1788) to Countess Maria Christiane von Thun und Hohenstein (1765-1841), the &quot;beautiful&quot; (according to Otto Erich Deutsch) daughter of Count Franz Josef Anton von Thun und Hohenstein (1734-1801), an Imperial Chamberlain and his wife, Countess Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein, née Countess von Uhlfeldt (1744-1800).
==Relationship with Mozart==

In 1789 he traveled to Berlin, taking Mozart along with him. For details of the trip, see Mozart&#x27;s Berlin journey.

He also lent Mozart money, which Mozart was unable to repay. This led the Prince to sue Mozart, and on 9 November 1791, a few weeks before Mozart died, the Lower Austria Court (&quot;Landrechte&quot;) decided the case in favor of the Prince, ruling that Mozart owed him the sum of 1,435 florins and 32 kreutzer, a substantial amount. The court issued an order to the chamber of the Imperial court (Mozart&#x27;s employer) to attach half of Mozart&#x27;s salary of 800 florins per year. The evidence of the lawsuit was uncovered (by Otto Mraz) only in 1991, and hence is not discussed in earlier Mozart biographies.

==Relationship with Beethoven==

Lichnowsky was one of the most significant aristocratic supporters of Beethoven. In an 1805 letter the composer called him &quot;one of my most loyal friends and promoters of my art.&quot;

In 1796, the Prince traveled to Prague, this time taking Beethoven with him. The composer was on his way to Berlin.

In 1800, Lichnowsky gave Beethoven an annual allowance of 600 florins until such time as he found a regular appointment as a musician. The stipend continued until 1806, when a furious quarrel erupted between the two, terminating their friendship: Beethoven, staying at Lichnowsky&#x27;s country estate, had refused to play for visiting French officers. Later, arriving home in Vienna, Beethoven smashed a bust of the Prince.

Seven of Beethoven&#x27;s musical compositions, all before 1806, were dedicated to Lichnowsky:

*The three piano trios, Opus 1 (1795)
*The &quot;Nine variations for piano on &#x27;Quant&#x27;è più bello&#x27; from Giovanni Paisiello&#x27;s opera &quot;La Molinara&quot;&quot;, for piano solo, WoO 69 (1795)
*The Piano sonata in C minor, Opus 13, &quot;Pathétique&quot; (1798)
*The Piano sonata in A-flat major, Opus 26 (1801)
*The Second Symphony in D major, Opus 36 (1802)

== Death ==
He died of a stroke in Vienna on 15 April 1814.

<doc id="1129983" wikidata="Q1267223" url="?curid=1129983" title="RTL (Croatian TV channel)">
<text>RTL (previously known as RTL Televizija) is a Croatian free-to-air television network founded on 30 April 2004. It was owned by the RTL Group from 2004 to 2022. Since 1 June 2022, it is owned by the CME Group. It is the second commercial television network in Croatia that has a national concession, following Nova TV.

== History ==
RTL began broadcasting on 30 April 2004 at 18:45 CET. The first broadcast of RTL&#x27;s news program, &quot;RTL Vijesti&quot;, was hosted that day by Tomislav Jelinčić and Tanja Tomić. At the time of its launch, RTL was operated from one office which contained only 10 computers and 10 employees. Throughout the years, the network grew into a multi-medial platform with over 300 employees.

On 15 May 2014, RTL Group announced that Henning Tewes, managing director of news provider Enex, would be appointed chief executive officer (CEO) of RTL Hrvatska from 1 July 2014. Tewes succeeded Johannes Züll, who left the RTL Group to become president and CEO of Studio Hamburg. Following a proposal from Tewes, Ivan Lovreček, former editor-in-chief and member of the executive board of RTL Hrvatska, was promoted to deputy CEO of the company on 1 July 2014.

The blocks got a three-dimensional design on 16 September 2015. Mein RTL would be used in some idents.

On 12 November 2019, as part of a nationwide transition to the DVB-T2 broadcast standard among all Croatian broadcasters, the channel including with RTL 2, RTL Kockica, RTL Passion, RTL Living, and RTL Crime launched their HD feeds. A month later, on 20 December 2019, RTL debuted a new flat logo and graphics package that replaced the Phoenica font (used by RTL&#x27;s parent channel in its on-air appearance) with the well-known FF DIN font. At this point, its slogan was &quot;Više od Televizije&quot; ().

On 15 September 2021, the German version of RTL was relaunched with a new multi-colored logo. It was confirmed that the new logo would debut in Croatia sometime in the near future, however this has not happened as of 2024. 

On 14 February 2022, it was announced that RTL Group reached an agreement with Central European Media Enterprises for the sale of RTL Hrvatska. On 1 June 2022, the transaction of RTL Hrvatska to CME had been completed.

The channel celebrated 20 years of existence through April and May of 2024, featuring new ident bumpers with taglines such as &quot;20 years of originality&quot;, &quot;20 years ahead of everyone&quot; and &quot;20 years of changing lives.&quot; The bumpers featured RTL&#x27;s most prominent television personalities, such as the news&#x27; and other program&#x27;s hosts. A special two-part series titled &quot;20 godina zajedno&quot; ( &quot;20 Years Together&quot;) aired on 4 and 5 May. Hosted by Antonija Blaće, the special series looked back on the most memorable moments in RTL&#x27;s history.

==Programming==
=== Original programming ===
Along with HRT and Nova TV, RTL is one of the three networks that air the largest amount of original television programming in Croatia. In recent years, the channel usually slots original series during the week in the evening, from around 17:00 CET, with the network&#x27;s major shows airing in the prime time (20:15 to 22:00 CET). Earlier parts of the day are usually reserved for acquired programming and for re-runs of the shows from the previous day. 

==== News programming ====
RTL broadcasts its own news program daily. Currently, the main news program titled &quot;RTL Danas&quot; ( &quot;RTL Today&quot;) airs its short news program at 16:30 CET every day excluding Friday, followed by the main news program airing daily from 19:00 to 20:15 CET. &quot;RTL Danas&quot;, which was previously known as &quot;RTL Vijesti&quot; ( &quot;RTL News&quot;), covers the most prominent political, cultural and other news of the day that are relevant in Croatia and in the world.

As of April 2015, a 30-minute late-night news program titled &quot;RTL Direkt&quot; airs Monday to Thursday, usually around 22:15 CET. Although &quot;Direkt&quot; mostly recaps political and other events featured in &quot;RTL Danas&quot;, it also focuses on covering popular culture, an example being a special episode aired 13 May 2024 which was dedicated to the review of the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. &quot;Direkt&quot; usually features guests, varying from political persons, celebrities, experts in certain fields and other notable people. Its current host is Mojmira Pastorčić, who replaced Zoran Šprajc in 2022. 

==== Scripted series ====
RTL is known for &quot;Zabranjena ljubav&quot;, the first Croatian soap opera. It premiered in 2004 and aired over 800 episodes. RTL also aired various original drama and comedy series through the years. 

==== Reality series ====
A large chunk of RTL&#x27;s original programming consists of reality series, which are mostly Croatian adaptations of foreign reality show formats. In September 2004, RTL began airing &quot;Big Brother,&quot; its first reality series. The finale of the first season reached a record audience of 1.8 million viewers. The series went on to air seven seasons, concluding in May 2018. 

The channel aired various dating reality series, the first being &quot;Scrolovka&quot; in 2004. &quot;Ljubav je na selu&quot; ( &quot;Love is at the Countryside&quot;), a Croatian iteration of &quot;Farmer Wants a Wife&quot;, premiered in September 2008, and is one of the longest-running Croatian reality series, having entered its seventeenth season in May 2024. RTL also aired Croatian iterations of other popular dating series such as &quot;Brak na prvu&quot; (&quot;Married at First Sight&quot;) and &quot;Gospodin Savršeni&quot; (&quot;The Bachelor&quot;). 

Cooking and food-related reality series are also a part of RTL&#x27;s staple programming. &quot;Večera za 5&quot; ( &quot;Dinner for Five&quot;, based on &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;), has been on air since 2007. The series was re-branded as &quot;Večera za 5 na selu&quot; ( &quot;Dinner for Five at the Countryside&quot;) from 2019 to 2022 until returning to its original title in 2023. It is the longest-running Croatian culinary series. In 2013, RTL aired an original cooking reality series format titled &quot;Tri, dva jedan - peci!&quot; (transl. &quot;Three, two, one - bake!&quot;), and later its spin-off &quot;Tri, dva jedan - kuhaj!&quot; (transl. &quot;Three, two, one - cook!&quot;), which premiered in 2014. Croatian versions of &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot; and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; were also aired by the channel. 

A part of the channel&#x27;s programming has also been dedicated to talent-show singing reality series. &quot;Hrvatska traži zvijezdu&quot; ( &quot;Croatia&#x27;s Star Search&quot;), was the second Croatian iteration of Idol, following Nova TV&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Hrvatski Idol&quot;. It aired three seasons from 2009 to 2011. A reboot of the series titled &quot;Superstar&quot; premiered on RTL in September 2023.

=== Acquired programming ===
The channel mostly acquires English-language programming, as well as a smaller chunk of regional (Serbian or Slovene) programming. Throughout 2000s and early 2010s, RTL aired popular American sitcoms such as &quot;Family Matters&quot; (1989–1998), &quot;Full House&quot; (1987–1994), &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (2005–2014), &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (2000–2005), &quot;Step by Step&quot; (1991–1997), and &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1993–1998). During this period, Spanish-language telenovelas were also popular on the channel, including &quot;Dame Chocolate&quot; (2007) and &quot;El Rostro de Analía&quot; (2008–2009), until Turkish series such as &quot;Muhteşem Yüzyıl&quot; (2011–2014) took over in the early 2010s. Most of such programs were moved to RTL 2 after its launch in 2011, and later to RTL Passion. Serbian series that aired on the channel include &quot;Južni vetar&quot; (2022) and &quot;Toma&quot; (2023–2024). 

Before launching RTL Kockica in 2014, the channel also focused on programming for children, airing animated series every day in the morning. Croatian dubs of series such as &quot;Ben 10&quot; (2005–2008), &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; (1995–2003), &quot;PopPixie&quot; (2011), &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; (2003), and &quot;Trollz&quot; (2005) premiered on RTL. The Croatian dub of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (2000–) also originally premiered RTL, before the series was moved to Nickelodeon with its Croatian-language audio launch in 2011. The channel occasionally featured a programming block titled &quot;Disney dan&quot; ( &quot;Disney Day&quot;), airing popular Disney movies such as &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003) and &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013).

===Sports===
Throughout all of its daily news programs, RTL Televizija has broadcast daily sports news throughout all of its daily news programs. The Croatian national football team used to broadcast its away matches there between 2004 and 2007. Since 2008, HRT has been broadcasting these matches once again.

RTL Televizija occasionally also broadcast boxing bouts and the highlights of the Red Bull Air Race events. They also bought the TV rights for all the matches of the 2009 World Men&#x27;s Handball Championship, which was held in Croatia. This proved to be a big hit to Croatia&#x27;s public broadcaster HRT, who even threatened to take legal action against RTL after they refused to sell them the rights to broadcast the match highlights during their news programs. 

==Streaming==
RTL launched its streaming service RTL Play on 12 January 2018. It was a free ad-supported service that offered access to RTL&#x27;s programming, as well as a livestream of RTL&#x27;s channels. A paid Play Premium option was also available; it featured access to locked content and programming exclusive to the service, such as new episodes of the scripted drama series &quot;Krv nije voda&quot;.

In July 2023, RTL announced that RTL Play is getting replaced with Voyo, a subscription-based video on demand over-the-top service. Voyo launched on 27 August, offering subscribers an access to new episodes of RTL&#x27;s both original and acquired television series 24 hours prior to their television broadcast. The service also focuses on offering exclusive acquired programming that has not been broadcast on RTL.

<doc id="1129988" wikidata="Q3361454" url="?curid=1129988" title="Palisades Amusement Park">
<text>Palisades Amusement Park was a 38-acre amusement park located in Bergen County, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City. It was located atop the New Jersey Palisades, lying partly in Cliffside Park and partly in Fort Lee. The park operated from 1898 until 1971, remaining one of the most visited amusement parks in the country until its closure, after which a high-rise luxury apartment complex was built on its site.

==Trolley park era: 1898–1910==
The park overlooked the Hudson River on of New Jersey riverfront land. It straddled what is now Cliffside Park and Fort Lee, and faced the northern end of Manhattan.

In 1898, before common use of automobiles, the Bergen County Traction Company conceived the park as a trolley park to attract evening and weekend riders. It was originally known as &quot;The Park on the Palisades&quot;.

In 1908, the trolley company sold the park to August Neumann and Frank Knox, who hired Alven H. Dexter to manage it. Dexter imported a crude assortment of attractions which included a Ferris wheel, a baby parade, and diving horses.

== Schenck ownership: 1910–1934 ==
In 1908, the park was renamed &quot;Palisades Amusement Park&quot;, and the new owners began adding amusement rides and attractions.

In 1910 the park was purchased by Nicholas and Joseph Schenck and their Realty Trust Company. The Schencks were brothers who were active in the nascent motion picture industry in nearby Fort Lee, and operated the Fort George Amusement Park in New York City, across the Hudson River to the east. They renamed the park, naming it &quot;Schenck Bros. Palisade Park&quot;.

In 1912 the park added a salt-water swimming pool. It was filled by pumping water from the saline Hudson River, below in the town of Edgewater. This pool, in surface area, was advertised as the largest salt-water wave pool in the nation. Behind the water falls were huge pontoons that rose up and down as they rotated, creating a one-foot wave in the pool.

As the park added more attractions, it became so famous by the 1920s that the Borough of Palisades Park, located just west of the amusement park, considered changing its name to avoid confusion among amusement park visitors.

In 1928, the park introduced the Cyclone roller coaster, the third of Harry Traver&#x27;s &quot;Terrifying Triplets&quot;. Due to the high maintenance costs, the ride was removed six years later.

== Rosenthal ownership: 1934–1971 ==

In 1934 or 1935, Nicholas and Joseph Schenck sold the site for $450,000 to Jack and Irving Rosenthal. The brothers and entrepreneurs had made a fortune as concessionaires at Coney Island in Brooklyn. They also owned some concessions and a carousel at Savin Rock Amusement Park in West Haven, Connecticut. The Rosenthals built the Coney Island Cyclone, a wooden coaster, completely different from the Travers&#x27; Triplets, in 1927.

In 1935 the park was partially damaged by fire. In 1944, a second fire killed six people, forcing the park to close until the start of the 1945 season.
The Rosenthals reverted the park&#x27;s name to the more recognizable &quot;Palisades Amusement Park.&quot; One of the many attractions, rebuilt and redesigned by construction superintendent Joe McKee, was the Skyrocket roller coaster. The Rosenthals named the newly repaired coaster the &quot;Cyclone&quot;, after their Coney Island coaster. In 1958, Joe built the Wild Mouse roller coaster with his construction foreman Bert Whitworth.

The park&#x27;s reputation and attendance continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, largely due to saturation advertising and the continued success of the park&#x27;s music pavilion and Caisson bar erected during that time.

In the mid-1950s the park started featuring rock and roll shows, hosted by local radio announcers Clay Cole and &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot; Morrow. In the 1960s, Motown musical acts performed there. Advertisements for the park were frequently printed in the back pages of 1950s and 1960s comic books, along with clip-out coupons, good for one free ride on a specific attraction. The Rosenthals realized that youth in the New York metropolitan area represented the largest single market for comic books in the nation, and that comic book advertising was a cheap way to reach thousands of potential customers.

===Segregation===
In 1946, the park formed the Sun and Surf Club and restricted pool access to members only. In the book &quot;Palisades Amusement Park: A Century of Fond Memories&quot;, the author Vince Gargiulo writes that &quot;In reality, the club allowed park officials to discriminate according to the color of the patron&#x27;s skin&quot;. He cites an example in July 1946, where eight black and two white people entered the park together. The white people were allowed to purchase tickets while the black people were prohibited from doing so. In response, African Americans started protesting against the Palisades Amusement Park pool&#x27;s segregation policy. Some protesters held signs that stated &quot;Protest Jim Crow&quot;.

On July 13, 1947, Melba Valle, a 22-year-old African-American woman, tried to use a pool admission ticket from a Caucasian friend, but was not allowed to enter the pool. Valle was then &quot;&#x27;forcibly dragged and ejected&#x27; from the Park&quot;, as described in several newspapers. As a result, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) started protesting at the Palisades Amusement Park entrance. The police detained 11 CORE members. The group stated that they would protest at the park entrance on Sundays, and would only stop their protests when the pool started allowing African Americans.

The protesters handed out the following flyer in 1947, which is now on exhibit in the Fort Lee Museum.
The policy was dropped in the 1950s.

===&quot;Palisades Park&quot; song and boom in popularity===
In 1962, Chuck Barris composed and Freddy Cannon recorded a song about the park entitled &quot;Palisades Park&quot;&quot;.&quot; The song was an up-tempo rock and roll tune initiated by a distinctive organ part. The song incorporated amusement park sound effects. &quot;Palisades Park&quot; received nationwide radioplay and increased the park&#x27;s fame even more. The &quot;Palisades Park&quot; song generated a surge of park visitors.

There was a hole in the fence behind the amusement park&#x27;s music stage, which was used by local children to sneak into the park without paying admission. Although the Rosenthal brothers knew about the hole, they did not repair it. Unlike many modern amusement parks that require visitors to buy an all inclusive pass before entering the grounds, Palisades Amusement Park charged individual fees for each ride and attraction inside the park. Irving Rosenthal, who loved children even though he had none of his own, allowed this &quot;secret&quot; entrance to remain and instructed security personnel to ignore anyone sneaking through it. He felt that children, who had little money to start with, would be more willing to spend their limited funds inside the park if they got in for free.

Irving Rosenthal printed free-admission offers on matchbooks and in other media. He owned an advertising company that put up billboards known as &quot;three sheeters&quot; all over New York City.

Parking was free for the same reasons. As the park began attracting bigger and bigger crowds in later years, the on-site parking lot became less and less adequate, often rapidly filling to capacity. An overflow parking lot was opened at the bottom of the cliff in Edgewater, and shuttle buses carried visitors up to the park. The overflow lot sometimes reached capacity, and when this happened, motorists were directed to park on local streets anywhere between the nearby George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel several miles south. This reduced parking for local residents and businesses, and added to street congestion.

From 1947 to 1971, Palisades Park averaged 6 million visitors per year. Peak attendance was reached in 1969, with 10 million visitors. Radio and television commercials broadcast in the greater New York area encouraged the public to, &quot;Come on over!&quot; with a jingle written by Rosenthal’s wife, songwriter Gladys Shelley.

==Demise==
Three factors contributed to the eventual closing of Palisades Amusement Park: inadequate parking facilities; growing uncertainty about the park&#x27;s future; and an increase in the number of incidents where visitors got injured or killed.

In 1967, Jack Rosenthal died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, leaving his brother Irving as sole owner. Irving, in his 70s, was not expected to manage the park for much longer. Without family heirs, it was unclear who would eventually assume ownership. Meanwhile, the park had become so popular that the towns of Cliffside Park and Fort Lee saw increased and worsening congestion from park patrons who did not live in the area.
Local residents objected to the traffic jams, noise, litter, changing racial demographics, and other effects of the park&#x27;s immense popularity. They demanded action from local elected officials. Meanwhile, developers wanted to profit from the Palisades&#x27; view of Manhattan. They successfully pressured the local government to re-zone the amusement park site for high-rise apartment housing and condemn it under eminent domain.

During the next few years, the land was surveyed by a number of builders who made lucrative offers. Irving Rosenthal, who, during the park&#x27;s heyday in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, would refer to Fort Lee as &quot;his town&quot;, attempted to postpone the park&#x27;s inevitable closing and refused to sell.

In January 1971, a Texas developer, Winston-Centex Corporation, acquired the property for $12.5 million, and agreed to lease it back to Irving Rosenthal so that Palisades Amusement Park could operate for one final season. The park permanently closed on Sunday, September 12, 1971. The last person to swim in the famous &quot;world&#x27;s largest outdoor saltwater pool&quot; was Curt Kellinger, son of long time park employee and pool manager George Kellinger Sr.

After it closed, Morgan &quot;Mickey&quot; Hughes and Fletch Creamer Jr. tried to reopen the park for one more season and obtained a lease from Winston-Centex. The town of Fort Lee would not issue a business license until the next spring, and even then the town could not guarantee such a license. The buildings were demolished. The rides were sold, dismantled, and transported to other amusement operators in the United States and Canada. The towns of Cliffside Park and Fort Lee considered using the park&#x27;s salt-water swimming pool for municipal recreation, only to find that its filtration system had been damaged beyond repair by vandals.

Four high-rise luxury apartment buildings stand on the old park site today. The first two built were Winston Towers. Carlyle Towers followed, and then the Royal Buckingham. In 1998, on the centennial of the opening of the original Park on the Palisades, Winston Towers management dedicated a monument to Palisades Amusement Park on its property. The monument is a small park, with the names of the rides inscribed on its bricks, named &quot;The Little Park of Memories.&quot; 

In June 2014, five original roller coaster cars from The Cyclone that were &quot;gathering dust for decades&quot; were returned to Bergen County from Pennsylvania, and were planned to undergo a restoration project, more than 40 years after the park&#x27;s closing. Though the cars are not functional, they were anticipated to be publicly showcased and displayed.

== In literature and the arts ==
Alan Brennert&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;Palisades Park&quot; is a fictional account of a family beginning in 1922 and ending in 1971, when the amusement park closed. The author used the park as a backdrop and interviewed many local people as part of the background of the novel.

Two pop songs about the park were released as singles: &quot;Palisades Park,&quot; a 1962 hit for Freddy Cannon, and a 2014 song of the same name by the American rock band Counting Crows. The Counting Crows song includes many references to the amusement park in the lyrics, including the Sky Rocket and the Wild Mouse. American soul pop singer/songwriter A Girl Called Eddy featured a song titled &quot;Come to the Palisades!&quot; on her album &quot;Been Around&quot; from 2020, that mentions the park in a nostalgic fashion. And the park is mentioned in the lyrics of The Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Amusement Parks U.S.A.&quot;, from their 1965 album &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;. The Beach Boys later covered &quot;Palisades Park&quot; on their 1976 album 15 Big Ones.

Casual depictions and mentions of Palisades Park are seen in various works set in the New York City area when the park was extant – in the 1945 film &quot;The Clock&quot;, the lights of the rollercoaster and other structures in the park can be seen across the Hudson while the young lovers wait for a bus on Riverside Drive; in the opening credits of the 1956 film &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;, the park&#x27;s lighted sign and roller coaster can be seen clearly from across the Hudson River in Upper Manhattan; in Chapter IV of the comic book &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Dr. Manhattan looks at an old photograph that is taken at the amusement park; In the original &quot;West Side Story&quot; movie, there is an ad for Palisades Park painted on the wall outside Doc&#x27;s Soda Shop, first appearing at the 1:03 mark; The &quot;Palisades Park&quot; song can be heard playing on the radio of the taxi driver who is harassed by the Newark police in &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;, the 2021 prequel film to the HBO crime drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;; A poster advertising Palisades Park is seen in the &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode, &quot;The Telltale Moozadell&quot;; in the sixth episode of &quot;Mad Men&quot; (August 23, 2007) Don Draper carries his daughter who is holding a pink helium balloon that reads &quot;Palisades Amusement Park&quot; to bed after an outing; and so forth.

<text>Arminas Narbekovas (born 28 January 1965 in Gargždai) is a former Lithuanian footballer who played as a midfielder. In 2003, he was selected by UEFA as his country&#x27;s Golden Player, the greatest player of the past 50 years.

==Personal life==
Arminas Narbekovas was born to a Tatar father Andrey Narbekov and a Lithuanian mother.

==Career==
Narbekovas made his debut in 1983 with Žalgiris Vilnius, Lithuania&#x27;s sole representative in the Soviet Top League, at the age of 18. In 1987, he finished second in league scoring with 16 goals while leading his club to a third-place finish, their best in history. Zalgiris would then participate in the UEFA Cup for the first time, losing to Austria Vienna. Austria would become Narbekovas&#x27; destination after Lithuanian players were allowed to move abroad. Arminas moved there in 1990 after a short stint with Lokomotiv Moscow, since Lithuania was not a part of UEFA yet and players from its clubs were not permitted to transfer. Narbekovas would spend the rest of his club career in Austria, with Austria Vienna until 1995 and then with Admira Wacker and a number of other lower division clubs.

==International career==
Although he never received a FIFA-sanctioned cap for the USSR national team, he did play for them, and win the gold medal, at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Narbekovas scored two goals in the tournament, including an extra time one in the semifinals against Italy, helping the Soviets to a 3–2 victory. Also, he represented USSR in 1987 Summer Universiade. Arminas first played for Lithuania in its first ever game as a newly independent country, on 27 May 1990 against Georgia, and scored the first goal in the 2–2 tie. Unfortunately, injuries limited his career to just 13 caps and four goals for his country.

==Honours==
===Club===
Austria Wien
*Austrian Football Bundesliga (3): 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93

<doc id="1130001" wikidata="Q1503275" url="?curid=1130001" title="Caster angle">
<text>The caster angle or castor angle is the angular displacement of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a steered wheel in a car, motorcycle, bicycle, other vehicle or a vessel, as seen from the side of the vehicle. The steering axis in a car with dual ball joint suspension is an imaginary line that runs through the center of the upper ball joint to the center of the lower ball joint, or through the center of the kingpin for vehicles having a kingpin. 

Caster causes a wheel to align with the direction of travel, and can be accomplished either by caster displacement or caster angle. Caster displacement moves the steering axis ahead of the axis of wheel rotation, as with the front wheels of a shopping cart. Caster angle moves the steering axis from vertical.

In automobile racing, the caster angle may be adjusted to optimize handling characteristics for a particular venue. This is all connected to the front wheels.

== History ==
Arthur Krebs proposed placing the front axle of a car at a positive caster angle in his UK patent of 1896, entitled &quot;Improvements in mechanically propelled vehicles.&quot; In it he stated it was intended &quot;To ensure stability of direction by means of a special arrangement of fore-carriage, that is to say, to re-establish automatically the parallelism of the two axles of the vehicle when there is no tendency to keep them in any other direction, or after a temporary effort has caused them to diverge from said parallelism. [...] The axle of the fore-carriage is situated a suitable distance behind the projection of the axis of the pivot-pin in order to ensure the stability of direction above referred to.&quot;

==Positive caster angle==
The steering axis is angled such that a line drawn through it intersects the road surface slightly ahead of the center of the contact patch of the tire on the pavement by a distance called trail. The purpose of this is to provide a degree of self-centering for the steering—the wheel casters around in order to &quot;trail&quot; behind the axis of steering. This makes a vehicle easier to control and improves its directional stability (reducing its tendency to wander). Excessive caster angle will make the steering heavier and less responsive, although in racing large caster angles are used for improving camber gain in cornering. Caster angles over 7 degrees with radial tires are common. Power steering is usually necessary to overcome the jacking effect from the high caster angle.

Some front-end alignment calls for different right-side and left-side caster. This is called cross caster, and the difference is called the spread. Cross camber may also be specified, but not usually both.

==Trail or trailing==
The steering axis (the red dotted line in the diagram above) does not have to pass through the center of the wheel, so the caster can be set independently of the trail, which is the distance between where the steering axis intersects the ground, in side view, and the point directly below the axle. 

Caster angle and trail both influence the steering, albeit in different ways: caster tends to add damping, while trail adds &quot;feel&quot; and returnability. 

The caster wheel on shopping carts are an extreme case the system is undamped but stable, as the wheel oscillates around the &quot;correct&quot; path. The construction has relatively high trail, but no caster, which allows changing of direction with minimal force. 

In this case the forces at the tire do not act at the center of the contact patch, but at a point behind the center. This distance is called the pneumatic trail and varies with speed, load, steer angle, surface, tire type, tire pressure and time. A good starting point for this is 30 mm behind the center of the contact patch.

==Front-end alignment==
When the front suspension of a vehicle is aligned, caster is adjusted to achieve a self-centering action in the steering, which affects the vehicle&#x27;s straight-line stability. Improper caster settings will require the driver to move the steering wheel both into and out of each turn, making it difficult to maintain a straight line.

==Two-wheeled vehicles==

In the context of bicycles and motorcycles, caster is more commonly referred to as &quot;head angle&quot;, &quot;rake angle&quot; or &quot;rake and trail&quot;, especially in American English. The terms caster or castor angle are still predominantly used in British English.

Some bicycle constructors refer to the angle subtended by the mechanical trail at the wheel center as caster.

<text>An artos (, &quot;leavened loaf&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;) is a loaf of leavened bread that is blessed during services in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine rite catholic churches. A large Artos is baked with a seal depicting the resurrection for use at Pascha (Easter). Smaller loaves are blessed during great vespers in a ritual called Artoklasia and in other occasions like feast days, weddings, memorial services etc.

==Etymology==
Artos in Ancient Greek meant &quot;cake&quot;, &quot;loaf of wheat-bread&quot;, collectively &quot;bread&quot;, but in Modern Greek it is now more commonly used in the context of communion bread used in church, having been replaced in the broader context by the word , &quot;psomi&quot;. This word is thought to be first attested in Mycenaean Greek as the first stem of the compound word , &quot;a-to-po-qo&quot;, &quot;bakers&quot;, written in the Linear b syllabary.

==Paschal Artos==

===Ritual===
Near the end of the Paschal Vigil, after the Prayer Before the Ambo, a single large loaf of bread, the Artos, is brought to the priest. Depicted on the top of the Artos are either the symbol of Christ&#x27;s victory over death—the Cross, surmounted by a crown of thorns—or the Resurrection of Christ. The Artos symbolizes the physical presence of the resurrected Christ among the disciples.
The priest blesses the Artos with a special prayer and sprinkles it with Holy Water. The Artos is then placed on a small table before the Iconostasis where it remains throughout Bright Week. It is customary, whenever the faithful enter the Temple, for them to kiss the Artos as a way of greeting the Risen Christ. On every day of Bright Week, after the Paschal Divine Liturgy (or, alternatively, after Paschal Matins), the Artos is carried in a solemn procession around the outside of the church.

In monasteries, the Artos is carried to the Trapeza every day of Bright Week, where at the end of the festive meal, it is lifted in a ceremony called the Lifting of the Artos. The one performing the ceremony will lift up the Artos (symbolizing Christ&#x27;s Resurrection) and say, &quot;Christ is Risen!&quot; All will respond, &quot;He is truly Risen!&quot; The celebrant will then make the sign of the Cross with the Artos as he says, &quot;We worship His Resurrection on the third day!&quot; Then two Paschal hymns are sung and everyone comes forward to kiss the Artos and receive the Superior&#x27;s blessing, as all sing the Paschal troparion many times.

On Bright Saturday, after the Divine Liturgy, the priest says another prayer over the Artos and it is then broken and distributed among the whole congregation along with the Antidoron.

===Significance===
The significance of the artos is that it serves to remind all Christians of the events connected with the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ. While still living on earth, the Lord called Himself the Bread of Life, saying: &quot;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall not hunger, and He who believes in Me shall never thirst&quot; (). After His Resurrection, more than once Jesus appeared to His disciples, ate before them and blessed their own food. For example, as evening fell on the first day of His Resurrection, He was recognized in Emmaus by two of His disciples as He blessed and broke bread ().

On the 40th day after His Resurrection, the Lord ascended into heaven, and His disciples and followers found comfort in their memories of the Lord: they recalled His every word, His every step and His every action. When they met for common prayer, they would partake of the Body and Blood of Christ, remembering the Last Supper. When they sat down to an ordinary meal, they would leave a place at the head of the table empty for the invisibly present Lord and would lay bread on that place.

Remembering this custom of the Apostles, the Fathers of the Church made it their custom to put out the Artos at the Paschal Feast in memory of the appearances of the Risen Lord to His disciples, and also in memory of the fact that the Lord Who suffered and was resurrected for our justification has made Himself the true Bread of Life and is invisibly present in His church always, to the close of the age ().

The Artos may also be compared to the unleavened bread of the Old Testament, which the people of ancient Israel, after being delivered from their captivity in the land of Egypt, ate during the week of the Passover (Ex. 12:15-20). As Cyril, Bishop of Turov, who lived during the 12th Century in Russia, said in a sermon for the Sunday after Pascha:

Even as the Jews bore the unleavened bread upon their heads out of Egypt through the desert () until they had crossed the Red Sea, after which they dedicated the bread to God, divided it amongst all their host, and having all eaten thereof, became...terrible to their enemies, even so do we, saved by our Resurrected Lord from the captivity of that Pharaoh of the mind, the Devil, bear forth the blessed bread the Artos from the day of the Resurrection of Christ and, finally, having dedicated this bread to God, we eat of it and preserve it to the health of body and soul.

It is a custom among Russian Orthodox Christians to this day to keep a portion of the artos throughout the year and with due reverence and faith to eat of it in time of illness or distress. This is eaten, often together with a drink of Holy Water, which had been blessed at the Feast of the Theophany of Our Lord.

==Artoklasia==

On feast days towards the end of vespers there is a blessing of loaves, wheat, wine, and oil, whereafter the priest breaks one of the loaves from which action the rite receives its name: &quot;Artoklasia&quot;, &quot;breaking of bread&quot;.

The loaves for the Artoklasia may be sealed (before baking) with a stamp (as are the Prosphora for the Divine Liturgy); such a seal may have an Icon of a saint on it, or it may be a simple cross—perhaps inscribed with a prayer on it, such as &quot;May the Blessing of the Lord be upon us. Amen.&quot;

<text>The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, commonly known as the United Steelworkers (USW), is a general trade union with members across North America. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, the United Steelworkers represents workers in Canada, the Caribbean, and the United States. The United Steelworkers represent workers in a diverse range of industries, including primary and fabricated metals, paper, chemicals, glass, rubber, heavy-duty conveyor belting, tires, transportation, utilities, container industries, pharmaceuticals, call centers, museums, and health care.

The United Steelworkers is currently affiliated with the AFL–CIO in the United States and the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) in Canada as well as several international union federations. On July 2, 2008, the United Steelworkers signed an agreement to merge with the United Kingdom and Ireland–based union Unite to form a new global union entity called Workers Uniting.

As of 2023, the International President of the United Steelworkers is David McCall, who was installed as president after the death of Tom Conway.

Rank-and-file members, as well as representatives, of the United Steelworkers refer to themselves, and are most often referred to, as Steelworkers. The use of the capitalized single word &quot;Steelworker&quot; or &quot;Steelworkers&quot;, as opposed to the lowercase two-worded &quot;steel worker&quot; or &quot;steel workers&quot;, is also an identifier of those who are part of, or affiliated with, the United Steelworkers International Union rather than being general non-union workers within the steel industry. This distinction is important in North America wherein a vast majority of the steel industry is unionized. For example, some of the most recognizable and largest companies in the business such as United States Steel (USS) and Cleveland-Cliffs, with their combined hourly workforces at facilities in North America being Steelworkers and represented by the USW, including the largest facilities on the continent, like US Steel&#x27;s Gary Works in Gary, Indiana, Cleveland-Cliffs&#x27;s Burns Harbor in Burns Harbor, Indiana, Indiana Harbor East and West in Northwest Indiana, and Cleveland Plant in Cleveland, Ohio, all of which are situated on the Great Lakes freshwater system. On the other hand, some steel companies, usually at facilities known as &quot;mini-mills&quot;, like Nucor Steel and its facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, are non-union shops not represented by the United Steelworkers.

==Origins and history==

The USW was established May 22, 1942, in Cleveland, Ohio, through the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) by a convention of representatives from the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers and the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, after almost six years of divisive struggles to create a new union of steelworkers. The drive to create this union included such violent incidents as the infamous Memorial Day, 1937, when Chicago policemen supporting the rival American Federation of Labor (AFL) fired on workers outside a Republic Steel mill and killed 10 men.

The founder and first president of the USW, Philip Murray, led the union through its first organizing drives and its first decade, when the workers of USW went on strike several times to win the right to bargain collectively with steel companies.

Significant job actions of the USW include:
* 1946 US Steel Strike
* 1952 steel strike
* Steel strike of 1959
* 1974 Elliot Lake miners strike
* Steel strike of 1986

==Growth of the union==

The 46,000 members of the Aluminum Workers of America voted to merge with the budding steelworker union that was the USW in June 1944. Eventually, eight more unions joined the USW as well: the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (1967); the United Stone and Allied Product Workers of America (1971); International Union of District 50, Allied and Technical Workers of the United States and Canada (1972); the Upholsterers International Union of North America (1985); the United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum and Plastic Workers of America (URW) (1995); the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers Union (ABG) (1996); the Canadian Division of the Transportation Communications International Union (1999); and the American Flint Glass Workers&#x27; Union (AFGWU) (2003).

In June 2004, the USW announced a merger with the 57,000 member Industrial, Wood and Allied Workers of Canada (IWA Canada), a major Canadian forestry workers union. In 2005 it then announced an even larger merger with the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE). The resulting new union adopted its current name after the PACE merger.

In September 2006, the Independent Oil Workers Union of Aruba, which represents refinery workers on the Caribbean island of Aruba, affiliated with the United Steelworkers, becoming the first USW union local outside of the US (including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands) and Canada.

In April 2007, the USW also merged with the Independent Steelworkers Union, adding 1,150 members at Arcelor-Mittal&#x27;s Weirton, West Virginia steel mill.

==Strategic alliances==
In addition to mergers, the USW has also formed strategic alliances with several other unions as well as other groups. In April 2005, the USW and the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) announced that they had formed a strategic alliance to take on the globalization of the culture industry and to address a range of common issues. In July 2006, the USW announced a similar arrangement with the United Transportation Union (UTU), to address common issues in the transportation industry, including the globalization of the industry. In July 2007, the USW inked yet another strategic alliance with the Canadian Region of the Communications Workers of America.

Beyond its affiliations with other unions, in June 2006, the USW announced the formation of a &#x27;Blue-Green Alliance&#x27; with the Sierra Club, with the goal of pursuing a joint public policy agenda.

In October 2009, the USW announced a framework for collaboration between US and Canadian Steelworkers with Mondragon Internacional, S.A., the world&#x27;s largest federation of worker cooperatives.

==2008 transoceanic merger==
In April 2007, Amicus, then the United Kingdom&#x27;s second-largest trade union, began discussions with the USW about a possible merger. Amicus subsequently merged with the British Transport and General Workers Union to form the new union Unite. Unite and the USW continued the merger talks initiated by Amicus.

In May 2008, the unions announced that they were putting the &quot;finishing touches&quot; on the merger, that the merger had been endorsed by Unite officials, and that the USW would discuss the plan at its forthcoming convention in July. Once completed, the new merged entity would represent more than 3 million workers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and the Caribbean. The unions have further announced that the new entity would target further mergers with labor groups in Australia and in the emerging economies of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. On July 2, 2008, USW and Unite leadership formally signed the merger agreement to create the new entity, to be called Workers Uniting.

==American politics==
In the 2006 election, the USW led a political mobilization program that eventually grew to include 350 full-time political organizers in 26 states, a majority of whom were rank and file USW members who took time from work to organize their communities and educate fellow union members. The USW turned out some 5,000 USW volunteers on Election Day, including over 1,000 each in the key states of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Exit polls suggested union families made up 23 percent of the total vote and supported Democratic candidates by a substantial 32 percent margin, 65 percent to 33 percent. Based on these numbers, the United Steelworkers, in conjunction with the rest of the labor movement, took substantial credit for the eventual Democratic victory.

The USW endorsed Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign and re-election, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign, and Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential campaign.

In 2023 and 2024, USW expressed opposition to the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japanese steel company Nippon Steel. USW International President David McCall stated in March 2024 that “Allowing one of our nation’s largest steel manufacturers to be purchased by a foreign-owned corporation leaves us vulnerable when it comes to meeting both our defense and critical infrastructure needs.”

==Canadian politics==
The United Steelworkers was a founding partner of the New Democratic Party and continues to be an affiliated union.

==Philanthropy==
The USW has contributed to various charitable and philanthropic causes since its creation. The USW has enthusiastically supported The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP), a nonprofit organization that works with brain-injured children. The USW has hosted the IAHP&#x27;s founder, Glenn Doman, at their annual convention. The USW has also held fundraising events for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. The USW has consistently stated that such charitable causes are important to its mission.

<doc id="1130010" wikidata="Q626884" url="?curid=1130010" title="Horton Hatches the Egg">
<text>Horton Hatches the Egg is a children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published in 1940 by Random House. The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird&#x27;s egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, &quot;I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant&#x27;s faithful, one hundred percent!&quot; Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie&#x27;s and Horton&#x27;s features.

According to Geisel&#x27;s biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel claimed the story was born in early 1940 when he left a window open in his studio, and the wind fortuitously blew a sketch of an elephant on top of a sketch of a tree. However, according to later biographer Charles Cohen, this account is probably apocryphal. He found elements of &quot;Horton&quot; in earlier Dr. Seuss works, most notably the 1938 short story &quot;Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex&quot;.

&quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; was published to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained popular with the general public. The book has also been used as the basis for academic articles on a variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; These two books later provided the thrust of the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical &quot;Seussical&quot;.

==Plot==
The book centers on a genial elephant named Horton, who is convinced by Mayzie, an irresponsible and lazy bird, to sit on her egg while she takes a short &quot;break&quot;, which turns into her permanent relocation to Palm Beach.

As Horton sits in the nest on top of a tree, he is exposed to the elements, laughed at by his jungle friends, captured by hunters, forced to endure a terrible sea voyage, and finally placed in a traveling circus. However, despite his hardships and Mayzie&#x27;s clear intent not to return, Horton refuses to leave the nest because he insists on keeping his word, often repeating, &quot;I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant&#x27;s faithful, one hundred percent!&quot;

The traveling circus ends up visiting near Mayzie&#x27;s new Palm Beach residence. She visits the circus just as the egg is due to hatch (after 51 weeks in Palm Beach) and demands that Horton should return it, without offering him a reward. However, when the egg hatches, the creature that emerges is an &quot;elephant-bird&quot;, a cross between Horton and Mayzie, and Horton and the baby are returned happily to the jungle, while Mayzie is punished for her laziness by ending up with absolutely nothing.

==Background==
According to Geisel&#x27;s biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; was born in 1940, the day after New Year&#x27;s, when he took a break from drawing in his Park Avenue apartment and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book&#x27;s creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.

Charles Cohen, on the other hand, found traces of &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; in early Dr. Seuss works. In an early installment of Geisel&#x27;s cartoon feature &quot;Boids and the Beasties&quot;, which began in &quot;Judge&quot; magazine in 1927, he juxtaposed a bird and an elephant. A few weeks later, he drew a story in which a whale ends up passed out in a catalpa tree. 

In 1938, two years before &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot; published perhaps the most obvious precursor to &quot;Horton&quot;, &quot;Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex&quot;, a short story by Geisel about an &quot;old maid elephant&quot; who sits on a chickadee egg until it hatches, only to have the newborn chickadee fly away from her. In 1939, Geisel created an advertisement for NBC featuring a sympathetic-looking elephant lashed with ropes and contained in a cage made of sticks, similar to Horton&#x27;s situation when the hunters capture him in &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot;.

In early drafts, the elephant&#x27;s name changed from Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was apparently after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel&#x27;s classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird&#x27;s name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered to sit on the eggs for the bird, who was very reluctant.

==Publication and reception==
&quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; was published by Random House in fall 1940 to immediate success. It received primarily positive notice from critics. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;sheer nonsense, but good fun.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; wrote, &quot;A moral is a new thing to find in a Dr. Seuss book, but it doesn&#x27;t much interfere with the hilarity with which he juggles an elephant up a tree. To an adult, the tale seems a little forced compared to his first grand yarns, less inevitable in its nonsense, but neither young nor old are going to quibble with the fantastic comedy of his pictures.&quot;

The book also found early success with book buyers and the general public. It sold 6,000 copies in its first year and 1,600 in its second. Frances Chrystie, the juvenile buyer for FAO Schwarz, wrote to Bennett Cerf, Geisel&#x27;s publisher, &quot;I&#x27;ve been sitting alone in my apartment reading &quot;Horton&quot; aloud to myself over and over again... It&#x27;s the funniest book I&#x27;ve ever seen... [Our] merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week.&quot; Mary Stix of James Book Store in Cincinnati, Ohio, noted the book&#x27;s popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.

&quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; has remained popular in the United States. In 2001, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported that the book had sold 987,996 to that point, placing it at 138 in the magazine&#x27;s list of the best-selling children&#x27;s books of all time. It was included in &quot;Six by Seuss: A Treasury of Dr. Seuss Classics&quot;, which was the main selection for the Book-of-the-Month Club in June 1991. In 1992, less than a year after Geisel&#x27;s death, Horton&#x27;s refrain was included in the 16th edition of &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;. In 2007, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;, based on an online poll.

==Analysis==
&quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; has been used in discussions on a wide variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption.

Alison Lurie, in a 1990 article about Dr. Seuss from a feminist perspective, criticized &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; as a statement for fetal rights (opposed by Lurie) and for its negative treatment of Mayzie. Lurie claimed an almost complete lack of strong female protagonists in Dr. Seuss books and further asserted that Mayzie, who is obviously an antagonist and is depicted as lazy and irresponsible, is &quot;the most memorable female character in [Dr Seuss&#x27;s] entire oeuvre&quot;. Geisel responded to Lurie&#x27;s criticism, by way of his biographers near the end of his life, by remarking that most of his characters are animals, noting, &quot;if she can identify their sex, I&#x27;ll remember her in my will.&quot;

Jill Deans, in a 2000 article, used the book in a discussion of adoption, surrogacy, and particularly, embryo donation. She noted that it is &quot;a classic tale of surrogacy&quot; and that it &quot;evokes the intricacies of the nature/nurture debate&quot;. She contends that the book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers, in the form of Horton, but vilifies birth mothers, in the form of Mayzie. Both Deans and Philip Nel point to the book&#x27;s real-life implications for Geisel and his wife. Deans draws a connection between the elephant-bird in &quot;Horton&quot; and the Infantograph, a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like. Nel, meanwhile, connected the book to the short story &quot;Matilda the Elephant&quot;. Noting that the Geisels could not have children, Nel argued that &quot;Matilda&quot;, and by extension &quot;Horton&quot;, may have been manifestations of the Geisels&#x27; longing for children.

In 2004, James W. Kemp, a retired United Methodist pastor, compared Horton to the early Christians to whom the First Epistle of Peter was addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, as evidenced by the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book.

Richard B. Freeman, writing in 2011 about the contemporaneous economic situation in the United States, called &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; a tale of investment. Freeman argued that &quot;economic growth requires long-term investments&quot;, as embodied by Horton&#x27;s sitting on the egg, and that &quot;trust is important in a well-functioning economy&quot;, as embodied by Horton&#x27;s repeated maxim, &quot;I meant what I said, and I said what I meant.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted into a ten-minute animated short film by Leon Schlesinger Productions and released in 1942 as part of Warner Bros.″ &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series. The short was directed by Bob Clampett and marked the first time a Dr. Seuss work was adapted for the screen and also the only time a WB animated short was licensed to be based on pre-existing work still under copyright.

In 1966, Soyuzmultfilm released an 18-minute Russian film adaptation called &quot;I Am Waiting for a Nestling&quot;. It was directed by Nikolai Serebryakov and won the Silver Medal for Best Children&#x27;s Film at Tours in 1967.

In 1992, Random House released &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; in its series of Dr. Seuss videos, narrated by Billy Crystal and directed by Mark Reeder. &quot;If I Ran the Circus&quot; is second in the double feature video.

The book itself was read in a 1994 episode of &quot;Kino&#x27;s Storytime&quot; as told by Gordon Jump.

Horton appeared again in &quot;Horton Hears a Who&quot;, published in 1954. The plot of the 2000 Broadway musical &quot;Seussical&quot;, a retelling of a number of Dr. Seuss books, borrows heavily from both &quot;Horton&quot; books.

Although never adapted into a feature film, the 2008 film adaptation of &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; references the book, with Horton quoting his most famous line, &quot;I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant&#x27;s faithful one hundred percent.&quot; While making the 2008 film, Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox briefly got the film rights to &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; as a proposed sequel to their adaptation.
