<text>Ice sculpture is a form of sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. Sculptures from ice can be abstract or realistic and can be functional or purely decorative. Ice sculptures are generally associated with special or extravagant events because of their limited lifetime.

The lifetime of a sculpture is determined primarily by the temperature of its environment, thus a sculpture can last from mere minutes to possibly months. There are several ice festivals held around the world, hosting competitions of ice sculpture carving.

==Raw material==
Sculpting ice presents a number of difficulties due to the variability and volatility of the material. Ice may be sculpted in a wide range of temperatures and the characteristics of the ice will change according to its temperature as well as the surrounding temperatures. Sculptures are generally carved from blocks of ice and these blocks must be carefully selected to be suitable for the sculptor&#x27;s purposes and should be free of undesired impurities. Typically, ideal carving ice is made from pure, clean water. However, clear, transparent ice is a result of the freezing process and not necessarily related to the purity of the water. Clouded ice is often the result of finely trapped air molecules that tend to bind to the impurities while naturally freezing. Mechanically clear ice is usually made as the result of controlling the freezing process by the circulation of the water in the freezing chamber. This process hopes to eliminate any trapped air from binding to the impurities in the freezing process. Certain machines and processes allow for slow freezing and the removal of impurities and therefore are able to produce the clear blocks of ice that are favored by ice carvers. However, not all blocks that are carved are clear ice. White ice blocks look like snow and are sometimes carved. Colored ice blocks are produced by adding dyes to the ice and can be carved as well. In some instances, clear ice and colored ice are combined to create a desired effect.

There are various sizes of ice blocks that are produced artificially. Naturally made blocks can be cut to almost any size from frozen rivers or from &quot;ice quarries&quot;, which are essentially lakes or ponds that have frozen over. Large ice blocks must be moved by heavy machinery and are used for large ice sculpting events or as part of an ice hotel.

==Techniques==

The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting; if the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment, then the sculptor must work quickly to finish the piece. Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if the carver is using power tools such as chainsaws and specialty bits fitted to a die grinder.

Ice sculptors also use razor-sharp chisels and hand saws that are specifically designed for cutting ice.

As various technologies are adapted for use with ice carving, many sculptures are now created largely by machine. CNC machines and molding systems are now commonly used to create ice sculptures and complicated logos from ice. Color effects are also possible by a number of techniques, including the addition of colored gels or sand to the ice.

This art form is traditionally taught in culinary schools using text books such as &quot;Ice Sculpting the Modern Way&quot;, Joseph Amendola&#x27;s &quot;Ice Carving Made Easy&quot; and Mac Winker&#x27;s &quot;Ice Sculpture: The Art of Ice Carving in 12 Systematic Steps&quot;. There are also small schools that teach ice carving.

The ice may be turned clear after carving by applying heat from a Propane or Mapp Gas cylinder. This alters the opaque effect that is obtained when carving. The ice turns clear after the outside is melted. Caution is to be used as the ice melts very quickly and could soften edges and contours. Sometimes distilled water is used for enhanced clarity.

==Uses==
Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines and may be used to enhance the presentation of foods, especially cold foods such as seafood or sorbets. The story of the creation of the dish Peach Melba recounts that Chef Auguste Escoffier used an ice swan to present the dish. At holiday buffets and Sunday brunches some large restaurants and hotels will use ice sculptures to decorate the buffet tables. Cruise ship buffets are also famous for their use of ice sculptures.

Ice sculptures are often used at wedding receptions, usually as some form of decoration. Popular subjects for ice sculptures at weddings are hearts, doves, and swans. Swans have a reputation for monogamy, partly accounting for their popularity.

Ice sculptures may be used at a bar, in the form of an ice luge, or even the entire bar may be made of ice.

Ice sculptures with high surface area like in a radiator can be used to cool air to blow on people during heat wave events when air conditioning is not available.

Ice sculptures, ice walls for fire fighting, property protection and cooling stations may be cast by a process in which ice water (one part), crushed ice or ice cubes (three parts) and tiny, floating, dry ice pellets (one part) are placed in a cement mixer. The tiny dry ice pellets super cool the ice water so that the ice water acts like glue to cement or freeze the crushed ice or ice cubes together within several seconds once the mixture stops moving within the mold. The ice water component of the mixture will expand 9% on freezing, so rubber, foam or foam lined casting materials work best to combat the water to ice expansion problem not encountered with wax, cement, casting plaster or metal casting materials.

Ice sculpture or ice walls may be stopped from melting by placing and keeping vertical voids in the ice sculpture or ice wall filled with the same type of tiny dry ice pellets used to make ice walls by the Icecrete process previously called Cryocrete in a 2014 U.S. provisional patent.

==Around the world==
There are a number of international ice and snow sculpting events around the world. The largest events are, understandably, held in countries with cold winters. Due to land distribution and population densities in the higher latitudes, large ice sculpture events are almost exclusively held in the Northern Hemisphere. A number of countries, some listed below, have established traditions of ice sculpting and have made contributions to the art. Ice artists from these countries regularly appear at international ice sculpture events.

===Belgium===
Ice sculptures were displayed at the Ice Sculpture Festival on November 28, 2010 in Brugge, Belgium. More than 300,000 kilograms of ice are shipped in for sculptors to work on in the special tents and it runs until January 16, 2011.

===Canada===
In Canada, Quebec City, Quebec holds an ice sculpture festival each year during the Quebec City Winter Carnival. The sculpture festival lasts about three weeks. For the sheer variety of ice sculptures and the number of visitors, the Quebec festival is regarded by some as the best in the world. Each year, about twenty teams are chosen to participate in the competition. Half of these teams come from Canada and the others come from other countries. Ice sculpting started to become important in Quebec in the 1880s, as traditional sculptors, like Louis Jobin, turned their skills on this less permanent medium.

Each year Lake Louise, located in Banff National Park, holds a three-day event called Ice Magic in the 3rd weekend of January. Sanctioned by the National Ice Carving Association, Professional carvers are invited to compete in this event staged in the shadow of the glacier-clad Mt. Victoria. Twelve teams of three carvers are given 15 blocks of ice, weighing 300 lb each, which they must transform into ice sculptures in three days. Weather permitting; the sculptures will remain on display through March.

The annual Deep Freeze Festival in Edmonton, Alberta hosts a chisel-and-chainsaw ice carving competition the second weekend of January. Sculptures are created by professionals and amateurs using three blocks of ice. Every year a theme is chosen, in 2013 the theme was &quot;The Wild West&quot;.

In the National Capital Region of Canada the Crystal Garden international invitational ice-carving competition starts every February, as part of the Winterlude winter festival of Ottawa. The competition site has been located in Confederation Park in Ottawa and also on the shores of Leamy lake in Gatineau, across the Ottawa River. There is a solo category, a pairs category and a one-bloc challenge. In addition to the sculptures done in the competition many ice sculptures are made to decorate the many Winterlude sites.

In Kingston, Ontario, the annual FebFest snow sculpture competition in Confederation Park in features snow forts by Royal Military College of Canada and Queen&#x27;s University. The snow fort must not only be pleasing to look at but also safe for children to play on. In 2008, Royal Military College of Canada&#x27;s snow fort was modelled after the MacKenzie Building in the Second Empire style with a Mansard roof and a central tower incorporating a working clock, flanked by projecting end towers and a slide. Both teams worked through the night, filling rectangular recycling bins with snow. In addition, ice sculptures of hockey players were made in memory of the first hockey game between Royal Military College of Canada and Queen&#x27;s University.

About 10 km East of Quebec city, near Montmorency Falls and within the grounds of the Duchesnay winter resort the first Ice hotel in North America is erected each January. Small and medium-sized ice sculptures are used to decorate the interiors.

===China===
In China, Heilongjiang Province is the most significant region for ice sculpture. The most famous event is the increasingly popular International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival held annually in Harbin. The festival has consistently increased in size over the years, with more talented artists involved and more impressive techniques and pieces on show. Ice sculpture decoration ranges from the modern technology of lasers to traditional ice lanterns. The climate of Heilongjiang is very cold and ice is plentiful. Objects of all sizes appear, up to and including building-sized pieces.

===France===
French Chef Auguste Escoffier was responsible for one of the most famous early ice sculptures and French sculptors are regular participants at the World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, Alaska.

===Ireland===
Not traditionally known for Ice sculpture, Ireland has produced some well respected sculptors, winning The International Ice Sculpture Festival in Jelgava, Latvia, in years past. See also Duthain Dealbh.

===Japan===
The Japanese city of Sapporo on the island of Hokkaidō is famous for its winter carnival, in which teams compete to create ice sculptures. Some of these creations are the size of multiple-story buildings. A winter carnival is also held annually in Asahikawa, also on the island of Hokkaidō. Japanese sculptors have made many contributions to the art. Notable Japanese ice sculptors include Yukio Matsuo, author of &quot;Ice Sculpture: Secrets of a Japanese Master,&quot; Mitsuo Shimizu, author of several Japanese books on ice sculpture, and Junichi Nakamura, winner of multiple world ice sculpting titles. Ice sculpture has been popular in Japan since the 1930s and an early advocate and teacher in the country was Shuko Kobayashi, the first chairman of the Japan Ice Sculpture Association.

===Philippines===

Most of the Filipino ice sculptors working abroad (Hotel &amp; Luxury Cruises) came from Paete, Laguna, a small town approximately 100 km. east of Manila. The name Paete came from the word &quot;paet&quot;, which means &quot;chisel&quot;. Paete was declared by Philippine President Arroyo as &quot;The Carving Capital of the Philippines&quot; as their speciality and main source of income is woodcarving. Paetenians hold an Ice Carving Competition every year on the last week of July as a way to celebrate their town Fiesta. About 50 young natives of this town have been participating each year.

===Russia===
An annual competition is held at Moscow&#x27;s Gorky Park, Perm Gorky Park, in Salekhard and other cities. Several Russian ice sculptors have won events at the World Ice Art Championships, including Vladimir Zhikhartsev, Sergei Loginov, and Vitaliy Lednev.

===Sweden===
Each winter since 1991, an ice hotel has been reconstructed in the village of Jukkasjärvi. ICEHOTEL, as it is known, is the oldest and most popular of a number of ice hotels that have since been constructed in a number of countries. ICEHOTEL is constructed almost entirely of ice and snow and each of the guest rooms feature different themes and elaborate ice and snow carving.

In 2009 an ice sculpture festival named ISSTJÄRNAN started in Sikfors, Hällefors, on the lake Sörälgen. The event takes place every year in February.

===United States===
Since 1989, Alaska has hosted the annual World Ice Art Championships. Nearly 100 sculptors come from around the world each year to sculpt large blocks of pristine natural ice sometimes referred to as &quot;Arctic Diamonds&quot;. The event is run almost exclusively by volunteers.

In a typical year, more than 45,000 spectators pass through the gates of the Ice Park home of the World Ice Art Championships. The competition is broken down into two main categories: Single Block and Multi-Block and each competition is further separated into Abstract and Realistic sculptures. One of the most popular attractions is the Kids Park where children of all ages can glide down ice slides or spin in ice twirly tops.

Typically held the last week of February and the first week of March, spectators may view the sculptors at work during the championship competitions. In the Single Block Classic, teams of up to two persons work on a 3&#x27;×5&#x27;×8&#x27; (90 cm × 150 cm × 200 cm) block of naturally formed Alaskan ice, weighing roughly 7,800 pounds (3,500 kg). In the Multi-Block Classic, teams of up to four persons each receive ten blocks of approximately 6&#x27;×4&#x27;×3&#x27; (180 cm × 100 cm × 90 cm) each weighing about 4,400 pounds (2,000 kg). to create their crystal masterpieces. Teams that compete in both the Single Block and Multi-Block events must handle a total of 50,000 pounds (23 t) of ice. Power tools and scaffolding can be used in both events: assistance from heavy equipment is only permitted in the Multi-Block Classic Competition. Thus, participation in the event requires strength, endurance, and engineering skill as well as mastery of basic ice sculpture techniques and artistic vision.
The National Ice Carving Association (NICA), based in Oak Brook, Illinois (in the Chicago metro area) is an organization of ice carvers and those interested in ice carving. NICA sanctions and supports various ice sculpture competitions around the United States and in Canada and has held a yearly National Championship since 1991. The association has developed a point system for judging the quality of ice sculptures created in timed competitions and certifies competition judges. NICA also was responsible for managing the ice carving competition held in conjunction with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and provided support for the 2006 event in Italy. In 2007, NICA started a &quot;Tour of Champions&quot; that rewards high scores over several competitions, usually including the National Championships.

===Argentina===
In the city of Rio Cuarto, Cordoba since 2015 there is an Ice Festival call &quot;Roca minus zero&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
The largest display of ice sculpting in the United Kingdom is the London Ice Sculpting Festival. The festival was organized in 2009 by Carol Cordrey and the Icebox. The competition is now held at Canary Wharf.

The London Ice Sculpting Festival chooses different themes every year, and for the 2012 competition chose the themes Team Spirit and Winter Sports. The 2012 winners were Jonathan Lloyd in the singles competition and Pedro Mira &amp; Niall Magee for the doubles competition. Jonathon Lloyd also won the Public Choice Award.

The festival also provides visitors with a chance to try ice sculpting themselves with classes by the Icebox. The 2012 London Ice Sculpting Festival featured classes focused on how to sculpt a husky dog.

<doc id="1128740" wikidata="Q6017283" url="?curid=1128740" title="Independent State of Rainbow Creek">
<text>The Independent State of Rainbow Creek was an Australian secessionist micronation active during the 1970s and 80s, located in Cowwarr, a town on the Thomson River in the Victorian Alps. It was founded on 23 July 1979 by Thomas Barnes in protest of alleged incompetence by the Government of Victoria and others in regards to the flooding of his and others&#x27; properties.

== Background ==
It was founded as a result of a long-running compensation dispute between a group of Victorian farmers in the town of Cowwarr, and an agency of the Victorian state government, the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (SRWSC).

A road bridge built over the Thomson River at Cowwarr in the late 1930s proved to be sited too close to the annual flood high-water mark, so when that structure proved an impediment to the flow of debris during a particularly violent flood in 1952, the river simply carved a new course for itself around the edge of the bridge. This &quot;breakaway&quot; - later named Rainbow Creek - passed through a number of privately owned farming properties. Remedial action proved ineffective, and the creek was enlarged by subsequent flooding to the size of several football fields - at the expense of the affected farmers’ lands.

The farmers began using water from the creek to irrigate their properties, however, local and state authorities responded by serving them with levies for water use. Those affected had to pay one set of levies to the local council for land which was now underwater because their title deeds did not show the existence of the creek, a second levy to the SRWSC for using creek waters for irrigation purposes, and a third levy to the Thomson River Improvement Trust which was supposed to prevent further erosion by the creek - which nonetheless continued to grow with each new flood. The SRWSC then constructed a weir across the river downstream of the bridge in 1954, which had the effect of funneling even higher volumes of floodwater directly into Rainbow Creek.

By the late 1970s, the creek was 8 metres (26 feet) deep and over 50 metres (164 feet) wide, and farmers had to privately fund the construction of bridges to cross from one part of their properties to the other. These were all washed away, along with crops, stock, and equipment by particularly severe flooding in 1978. The farmers of Cowwarr had long blamed government incompetence over nearly three decades for their woes, but when they were denied the right to claim compensation for loss of land, productivity, and private infrastructure in 1978 they decided to take further action.

One of the worst affected properties was Yammacoona, located directly below the weir, and owned by Thomas Barnes since 1970. Barnes was a retired UK and Victorian police officer who had settled in the town some time before. He was known as a man of feisty temperament with little patience for the slow-turning wheels of government bureaucracy, and a flair for publicity.

== Secession ==
In an attempt to gain public sympathy Barnes and around thirty other farmers decided to declare war on the state of Victoria. Signed on 19 December 1978, the Declaration was served with due pomp to a bemused governor in Melbourne on 16 January 1979, before banks of television cameras. Some legal scuffling between Barnes and the SRWSC followed in the Victorian court system, during which minor points were won and lost on both sides, after which a government offer of loans - but not the desired compensation - was rejected by the farmer group.

Barnes meanwhile had become aware of the Hutt River Province and seeking to emulate &quot;Prince Leonard&quot; took legal advice and then declared the unilateral secession of his property from the State of Victoria on 23 July 1979. He appointed himself &quot;Governor&quot; of the newly created Independent State of Rainbow Creek, and together with &quot;Minister for Information&quot; George Downing, swore allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom as his Head of State. His secession document was lodged with the Victorian Governor, the Governor-General of Australia, Buckingham Palace and the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

Public attention was again focused on Cowwarr, and the existence of the State of Rainbow Creek ensured that Barnes remained a thorn in the side of the SRWSC and the Victorian Government for a number of years, as he issued passports, stamps, banknotes and other printed material to promote the cause of his farming community.

Ill health eventually forced Barnes to retire to Queensland in the mid-1980s, from where he has since published several books of local history and poetry, whilst the issues that led to the Rainbow Creek secession remained unresolved.

<text>Enslaved is a Norwegian extreme metal band formed by Ivar Bjørnson and Grutle Kjellson in Haugesund in 1991. They are currently based in Bergen. The band&#x27;s lineup has changed many times over the years, with Bjørnson and Kjellson being the sole constant members. The current lineup also includes lead guitarist Arve Isdal, keyboardist/singer Håkon Vinje, and drummer Iver Sandøy.

The band&#x27;s music draws heavily on the Viking cultural and religious heritage of their home country of Norway for inspiration, and most of the band&#x27;s lyrics relate to Norse mythology. Though they began as a traditional black metal band, their sound has undergone significant changes over time resulting in a more progressive sound. In 2014, members of Enslaved were commissioned by the Norwegian government to create a musical piece in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Norwegian constitution. This was later released as a studio album called &quot;Skuggsjá&quot; (lit: Shadow watch) in 2016. To date, the band has released sixteen full-length studio albums; the most recent of which, &quot;Heimdal&quot;, was released in March 2023.

==History==

=== Formation and early history (1991–2007) ===
Enslaved was formed in 1991 by Ivar Bjørnson and Grutle Kjellson (also known as Kjetil Grutle) when they were 13 and 17 years old, respectively. The band name was inspired by an Immortal demo track, &quot;Enslaved in Rot.&quot; Prior to forming Enslaved, Bjørnson and Kjellson had been playing in a death metal band called Phobia, but like many in the burgeoning extreme metal movement, they were looking for new sources of inspiration and expression. Though Enslaved began as a prototypical Norwegian black metal band in 1991, by 1993 they were incorporating song structures unusual for the genre; several of their earlier songs reach the ten-minute mark (their debut album, &quot;Vikingligr Veldi&quot;, has only one song that is under ten minutes). As such, the band rejected the black metal label and preferred the term &quot;extreme metal&quot;. After several line-up changes throughout their early career, Bjørnson and Kjellson remained the only original founding members. By 2004, the line-up was solidified with guitarist Arve &quot;Ice Dale&quot; Isdal, drummer Cato Bekkevold, and keyboardist/vocalist Herbrand Larsen. The albums &quot;Isa&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ruun&quot; (2006) marked a departure from previous sounds, most notably with the inclusion of sharp dynamic shifts, and Bjørnson considers the former a turning point for the band. Following &quot;Ruun&quot;, Bjørnson, Kjellson, and Isdal collaborated with the Norwegian noise duo Fe-Mail under the name Trinacria in 2007.

=== International recognition (2008–2015) ===
Enslaved released the album &quot;Vertebrae&quot; in September 2008, their tenth studio album and their first on Nuclear Blast. &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine named it the album of the year in 2008, notably above other metal releases such as Meshuggah&#x27;s &quot;obZen&quot; and Opeth&#x27;s &quot;Watershed&quot;. After touring Europe extensively, Enslaved embarked on a North American tour with the progressive death metal band Opeth in May 2009. The album is noted for its shift in its approach and its diverse sounds; Sammy O&#x27;Hagar from MetalSucks.net even says that &quot;to call [Vertebrae] black metal would be quite a stretch&quot; because &quot;there&#x27;s an impressive depth to [it] that surpasses the sour misanthropy so often (and rightfully) associated with the genre&quot;, and furthermore describing their sound as &quot;heavy and surprisingly soft, focused and curious, true to their roots and longing to forget them&quot;. The album&#x27;s sound has been said to be akin to Pink Floyd&#x27;s sound on a few occasions, as well as other black metal releases in a similar vein.

The band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Axioma Ethica Odini&quot;, was released on 27 September 2010 in Europe and the following day in North America. In 2011, Enslaved released two new EPs. The first EP, entitled &quot;The Sleeping Gods&quot;, which was produced in partnership with Scion Audio/Visual, was released on 10 May 2011 and made available as a free download consisting of 5 original tracks. The second EP, entitled &quot;Thorn&quot;, was released on 27 August 2011 in partnership with Soulseller Records in fulfillment of a decade-old agreement. The &quot;Thorn&quot; EP, released on seven-inch vinyl, was strictly limited to 1,000 copies and featured a more atmospheric sound than the band is currently known for. Enslaved started their 20th anniversary tour &quot;Circling Above and Within North America Tour Part IV&quot; in September 2011 with Alcest and Junius in the United States and Canada. An official tribute album called &quot;Önd – A Tribute&quot; was released on Pictonian Records in July 2012. It contains covers from twenty bands (including Dordeduh, Fen, Kraków, Vreid and Wodensthrone) to celebrate the two first decades of Enslaved&#x27;s career.

After having signed to Nuclear Blast in Europe, Enslaved released their 12th studio album, &quot;RIITIIR&quot;, on 28 September 2012 in Europe and 9 October in North America. The album received positive reviews from music critics. In 2013, they contributed to the book &quot;Tenk som en rockestjerne&quot; (&quot;Think Like a Rockstar&quot;), written by Ståle Økland. Enslaved released their 13th full-length studio album, &quot;In Times&quot;, on 10 March 2015 through Nuclear Blast. The album received positive reviews from music critics, with AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek noting that the band are &quot;still pushing at the boundaries of the music that inspired them back in 1991 when guitarist Ivar Bjørnson and vocalist/bassist Grutle Kjellson (13 and 17 years old at the time) first formed the band.&quot; 

=== Recent history (2016–present) ===
In 2016, the band celebrated their 25th anniversary with a series of exclusive shows and merchandise designs. Their Spinning Wheel Ritual tour across Europe with Ne Obliviscaris and Oceans of Slumber will take place from late September to early November. They also announced their plans to release a new compilation album on 11 November 2016, titled &quot;The Sleeping Gods – Thorn&quot;. The album compiles rare and experimental material from 2010 to 2011 which were previously available as two separate EPs released in 2011: &quot;The Sleeping Gods&quot; and &quot;Thorn&quot;. In December 2016, keyboardist Herbrand Larsen left the band amicably after 12 years. The band then recruited Håkon Vinje of Seven Impale, a Norwegian band that previously opened for them at a concert in Bergen. In May 2017, Enslaved released their first live album, &quot;Roadburn Live&quot;, recorded during their performance at Roadburn Festival in 2015. Enslaved&#x27;s 14th studio album &quot;E&quot; was released on 13 October 2017. In June 2018, drummer Cato Bekkevold retired from the band amicably, and was replaced by Iver Sandøy, who had previously played in Bjørnson, Kjellson and Isdal&#x27;s side project Trinacria and co-produced several recent Enslaved albums. The band&#x27;s 15th album &quot;Utgard&quot; was initially announced for spring 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic until October 2020. The four-song EP &quot;Caravans to the Outer Worlds&quot; was released in October 2021; the EP was described by the band as a bridge between &quot;Utgard&quot; and their next full-length album in the future. Their sixteenth studio album &quot;Heimdal&quot; was released on March 3, 2023. 

== Musical style and influence ==
The band&#x27;s early music was rooted in traditional black metal and Viking metal, however the band moved away from this sound with 2001&#x27;s &quot;Monumension&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Below the Lights&quot;. It was at this point that the band was reduced to its two founding members, Bjørnson and Kjellson. They began to incorporate elements of progressive rock, jazz, and other distinct influences into their sound, and over time have continued this progression. Kjellson has named Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Rush, Genesis, Darkthrone, early Mayhem, and Bathory as important influences on the band&#x27;s sound.

<text>Orange SPV was a series of smartphones built by HTC and Amoi for the European mobile operator, Orange.

The first HTC model was installed with Microsoft Windows Mobile 2002 and launched late 2002. SPV stood for Sound, Pictures, Video, with the emphasis being on the device&#x27;s multimedia capabilities and potential. It came with a Texas Instruments OMAP710 processor which clocked in at a speed of 132 MHz. An internal memory of 16 MB RAM and 32 MB of Flash ROM was complemented with the addition of a Secure Digital storage card.

It was most notable as being the first Windows smartphone to be released and was greeted with much anticipation. The phone carried mini versions of such desktop applications as Outlook, Media Player and Internet Explorer alongside advanced calendar, task and contact management facilities, so focused on the business user segment.

Another of the main selling points of the phone at the time was the display, which had a reflective TFT screen producing 65,000 colours at 176 x 220 pixels resolution. The one drawback to all this in models before the E200 was the lack of a built in camera, something that was becoming increasingly common and popular on much less capable phones.

With a length of 11 cm, width 4.5 cm and a depth of 2 cm, it weighed just 95 g.

Various Orange SPV models were released until 2007.

<text>Luigi &quot;Lou Little&quot; Piccirilli December 6, 1891 – May 28, 1979) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head coach at Georgetown College—now known as Georgetown University—from 1924 to 1929 and Columbia University from 1930 to 1956, compiling a career college football coaching record of 151–128–13. Little played college football as a tackle at the University of Pennsylvania for the 1916 and 1919 seasons and professionally with the Frankford Yellow Jackets of the National Football League (NFL) from 1920 to 1923. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1960. Little appeared as &quot;Lu Libble&quot; in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;Maggie Cassidy&quot;, a fictionalized account of Kerouac&#x27;s early life.

==Early life, playing career, and military service==
Little was born in Boston. After his birth, his father changed his family name to &quot;Little&quot;, translating the Italian family name, and moved his family to Leominster, Massachusetts, in 1896. Little played football at Leominster High School, where he was the team captain in 1910, his senior season. The 1910 team, led by Little&#x27;s stellar play, was Leominster&#x27;s first undefeated football team. Little went on to play one postgraduate season for the Worcester Academy Hilltoppers, in 1911. before returning to coach his alma mater, Leominster High School, for one season, in 1912.

Little, played college football at the University of Pennsylvania. He gained national attention as a varsity tackle during 1916 season and was named All-American, and again in the 1919 season. Between those years, he served with distinction during World War I with the American Expeditionary Forces in France. Commissioned as a lieutenant, he was promoted to a captain in the 6th Infantry Division. He saw action in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

==Coaching career==
In 1924, Little accepted the post of head football coach at Georgetown and held the position until 1930, when he resigned to become head football coach at Columbia University. Little was the head coach at Columbia from 1930 to 1956. He was probably best known for two wins: the 1934 Rose Bowl when Columbia beat Stanford, 7–0, and a 21–20 win over Army in 1947 in which the Columbia Lions handed the Cadets their first loss since the 1943 season finale, snapping a 23-game undefeated streak. At Columbia, Little coached future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Sid Luckman and writer Jack Kerouac, who broke his leg playing in 1940. Other players he coached include Paul Governali, Lou Kusserow, Cliff Montgomery and Bill Swiacki.

==Personal life==
Little was married to Loretta Donohue for 50 years. Following his 1956 retirement, they lived in Barnstable, Massachusetts and Delray Beach, Florida until her death in 1977. 
Little died on May 28, 1979, at a nursing home in Delray Beach.

<doc id="1128771" wikidata="Q2698119" url="?curid=1128771" title="Kanrin Maru">
<text>was Japan&#x27;s first sail and screw-driven steam corvette (the first steam-driven Japanese warship, &quot;Kankō Maru&quot;, was a side-wheeler). She was ordered in 1853 from the Netherlands, the only Western country with which Japan had diplomatic relations throughout its period of &quot;sakoku&quot; (seclusion), by the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s government, the Bakufu. She was delivered on September 21, 1857 (with the name &quot;Japan&quot;), by Lt. Willem Huyssen van Kattendijke of the Dutch navy. The ship was used at the newly established Naval School of Nagasaki in order to build up knowledge of Western warship technology.

&quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, as a screw-driven steam warship, represented a new technological advance in warship design which had been introduced in the West only ten years earlier with . The ship was built by Fop Smit in Kinderdijk, the Netherlands (later known as L. Smit en Zoon). The virtually identical screw-steamship with schooner-rig &quot;Bali&quot; of the Dutch navy was also built here in 1856. She allowed Japan to get its first experience with some of the newest advances in ship design.

==Japanese embassy to the US==

In 1860, three years after &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was built, the Bakufu sent &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; on a mission to the United States commanded by Admiral Kimura Kaishū, clearly wanting to make a point to the world that Japan had now mastered western navigation techniques and ship technologies. On 9 February 1860 (18 January in the Japanese calendar), &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, captained by Katsu Kaishū together with John Manjiro, Fukuzawa Yukichi, and a total of 96 Japanese sailors, and the American officer John M. Brooke, left Uraga for San Francisco.

This became the second official Japanese embassy to cross the Pacific Ocean, around 250 years after the embassy of Hasekura Tsunenaga to Mexico and then Europe in 1614, aboard the Japanese-built galleon .

&quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was accompanied by a United States Navy ship, the USS &quot;Powhatan&quot; and arrived in San Francisco on March 17, 1860.

The official objective of the mission was to send the first ever Japanese embassy to the US, and to ratify the new Treaty of Amity and Commerce.

==Reclamation of the Bonin Islands==
In January 1861, &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was dispatched to the Bonin Islands, also known as Ogasawara Islands in Japanese. A navigator aboard the diplomatic mission, Bankichi Matsuoka was sent to survey the islands. The shogunate of Japan first claimed the Pacific islands and its multi-ethnical settler community in the face of competing Western empires. The islands had previously been claimed by Britain, and the United States had considered making them a navy base. As the flagship, &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was put to use in a display of military power reminiscent of the arrival of Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s black ships in Japan just a few years earlier.

==Boshin war==
By the end of 1867, the Bakufu was attacked by pro-imperial forces, initiating the Boshin War which led to the Meiji Restoration. Towards the end of the conflict, in September 1868, after several defeats by the Bakufu, &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was one of the eight modern ships led by Enomoto Takeaki towards the northern part of Japan, in his final attempt to wage a counter-attack against pro-imperial forces.

The fleet encountered a typhoon on its way northward, and &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, having suffered damage, was forced to take refuge in Shimizu harbour, where she was captured by Imperial forces, who bombarded and boarded the ship notwithstanding a white flag of surrender, and killed her crew.

Enomoto Takeaki finally surrendered in May 1869, and after the end of the conflict, &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was used by the new Imperial government for the development of the northern island of Hokkaido.

She was lost there in a typhoon in 1871, at Esashi.
== Monument and Replica ==
In 1960, the city of Osaka presented the city of San Francisco a Monument commemorating the 100 year anniversary of &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;&#x27;s arrival and ratification of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce.

In 1990, a double-scale replica of &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was ordered for manufacture in the Netherlands, according to the original plans. The ship was visible in the theme park of Huis Ten Bosch in Kyūshū, in southern Japan. It is now used as a sightseeing ship to the Naruto whirlpools from Minami Awaji harbour.

<doc id="1128773" wikidata="Q4897225" url="?curid=1128773" title="Beta-peptide">
<text>Beta-peptides (β-peptides) are peptides derived from β-amino acids, in which the amino group is attached to the β-carbon (i.e. the carbon two atoms away from the carboxylate group). The parent β-amino acid is β-alanine (H2NCH2CH2CO2H), a common natural substance, but most examples feature substituents in place of one or more C-H bonds. β-peptides usually do not occur in nature. β-Peptide-based antibiotics are being explored as ways of evading antibiotic resistance. Early studies in this field were published in 1996 by the group of Dieter Seebach and that of Samuel Gellman.

== Structure ==
As there are two carbons available for substitution, β-amino acids have four sites (chirality included; as opposed to two in α-amino acids) for attaching the organic residue group. Accordingly, two main types β-amino acids exist differing by which carbon the residue is attached to: ones with the organic residue (R) next to the amine are called β3 and those with position next to the carbonyl group are called β2. A β-peptide can consist of only one kind of these amino acids (β2-peptides and β3-peptides), or have a combination of the two. Furthermore, a β-amino acid can form a ring using both of its sites and also be incorporated into a peptide.

==Synthesis==
β-Amino acids have been prepared by many routes, including some based on the Arndt-Eistert synthesis.

==Secondary structure==
Because their backbones are longer than those of normal peptides, β-peptides form disparate secondary structures. The alkyl substituents at both the α and β positions in a β-amino acid favor a gauche conformation about the bond between the α-carbon and β-carbon. This also affects the thermodynamic stability of the structure.

Many types of helix structures consisting of β-peptides have been reported. These conformation types are distinguished by the number of atoms in the hydrogen-bonded ring that is formed in solution; 8-helix, 10-helix, 12-helix, 14-helix, and 10/12-helix have been reported. Generally speaking, β-peptides form a more stable helix than α-peptides.

==Clinical potential==
β-Peptides are stable against proteolytic degradation in vitro and in vivo, a potential advantage over natural peptides. β-Peptides have been used to mimic natural peptide-based antibiotics such as magainins, which are highly potent but difficult to use as drugs because they are degraded by proteolytic enzymes.

==Examples==
β-Amino acids with a wide variety of substituents exist. Named by analogy to the biological α-amino acids, the following have been found naturally: β-alanine, β-leucine, β-lysine, β-arginine, β-glutamate, β-glutamine, β-phenylalanine and β-tyrosine. Of these, β-alanine is found in mammals and incorporated in pantothenic acid, an essential nutrient. Two α-amino acids are also structurally β-amino acids: aspartic acid and asparagine. Microcystins are a class of compounds containing a β-isoaspartyl (i.e. aspartic acid linked with its beta-carboxyl) residue.

<doc id="1128774" wikidata="Q3278307" url="?curid=1128774" title="Iron palm">
<text>Iron palm or iron hand () is a body of training techniques in various Chinese martial arts. It is one of the original 72 arts of the Shaolin temple. These conditioning techniques are typically meant to condition the hands to allow a practitioner to deliver very powerful blows without injury to their hands.

==Overview==

Iron Palm is the vernacular for the results of serious training centered mainly on the palm of the hand, although other parts of the hand may also be targeted, and covers many different conditioning methods. Most Iron Palm systems are considered internal, utilizing qigong exercises to train other aspects of development in addition to the external conditioning which ultimately alters the internal structures of the hand, such as the bones and sinews.

Not all Iron Palm methods are a martial arts style unto itself, but rather form a special feature of specialized conditioning that appears in many schools of Chinese martial arts. Some non-Chinese martial arts styles, such as Muay Thai and many schools of Karate, also feature hand conditioning, but the term &quot;Iron Palm&quot; is not typically used to describe these types of training, as they tend not to focus on developing internal power when conditioning the hands for the bone-crushing forces encountered with the striking maneuvers evident in breaking normally &quot;unbreakable&quot; objects.

==General principles==

Iron Palm training often involves three primary components:

# Strengthening of the striking limbs by developing the tendons and ligaments from the shoulders to the fingertips, then striking or slapping relatively hard objects enclosed in canvas/leather bags. Following a conditioning session, the striking area is usually treated with a medicinal aid created from plant derivatives, usually a traditional Chinese liniment called Dit Da Jow. A common belief among practitioners is that failing to apply Dit Da Jow after Iron Palm training sessions can have negative effects on long-term health, such as movement limitation, arthritis, and other nerve damage to the hands. It is also believed that small blood clots can also occur if good Dit Da Jow is not used causing eye blindness through clots in small capillaries (blood vessels). Soaking and thorough massaging of hands after training is imperative.
# Using proper technique to strike with greater force: As in other martial arts, students learn specific body mechanics with the intent to produce a more powerful strike. Students train to relax the body and release residual tension in order to move faster. This is usually done with standing meditation routines designed to release the residual tension in the body and develop &quot;linking&quot; power. 
# Engaging in Qigong [] exercises, purportedly in order to develop &quot;qi&quot; (also chi or ch&#x27;i, or Japanese/Korean, ki []). This Qigong training coordinates breathing to improve mental focus, resulting in a more powerful strike.

==Direct and indirect methods==

Schools of Iron Palm training are often divided into &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot;. Both methods usually consist of striking progressively harder surfaces. Some practitioners also refer to their training as Neijin (&quot;internal strength&quot;) or Li (&quot;strength&quot;, also known as Waijin, &quot;external strength&quot;), referring to the Qi energy or type of force (jin) used. In the &quot;direct&quot; method the hands are thrust into buckets or containers of the medium; the hands come into direct contact with the substance. In the &quot;indirect&quot; method, the practitioner strikes bags or other containers filled with various materials. As training progresses, the bags or buckets are filled with increasingly resistant substances, starting with beans then sand, progressing onto gravel or river rocks (i.e. smooth pebbles), then finally steel, copper, or iron shot. Practitioners can measure their progress based upon the number of strikes performed in a particular training session or by the amount of clock time spent training. Relaxation while training the strikes and use of good Dit Da Jow medicine is imperative to yielding proper success. Exacting breath control is also essential for maximum effect/success.

==Uses==
The Chinese martial arts can utilize a wide variety of open and closed hand strikes. Hardening the hands is also considered by some to supplement speed and strength lost through aging. Iron palm practitioners often demonstrate their abilities by breaking hard objects such as bricks, coconuts, stones and boards with their bare hands or in some cases forcefully hitting a steel object rapidly without sustaining significant injury.

==Techniques==

Iron Palm uses five different striking techniques:
*Slapping with the whole palm
*Throwing with the back of the hand
*Cutting with the side of the palm
*Dotting with the fingertips
*Stamping with the base of the palm
These techniques are used when striking the Iron Palm bag which can be filled with a variety of materials such as sand, rice, dried mung beans or soy beans, pea gravel, or steel shot (whether bird shot or buck shot), depending on one&#x27;s level of expertise. Sometimes a mixture is utilized, e.g. soybeans &amp; steel shot in the same bag.
Before and after each training session, an Iron Palm liniment is applied to the hands to prevent injury and condition the hands. &quot;Tie Ba Zhang Yao&quot; is a popular liniment used for Iron Palm training and conditioning.

<text>Carla-Bayle is a commune in the Ariège department in southwestern France. It was the birthplace of Pierre Bayle (1647–1706), a Protestant philosopher and writer known for his works on religious toleration and his early encyclopedia.

==History==

Originally named &quot;Carla-le-Comte&quot;, the commune became a center of Protestant activity in the 16th century before the government suppressed it. Protestant philosopher and writer Pierre Bayle was born there, and was taught in his early years by his father, a Protestant minister. He briefly converted to Catholicism, before reverting to the Protestant Reform faith. His rejection of Catholicism led to his need to leave France. Later the government oppressed Protestants, who remained the majority in Carla. A Protestant strong point it was besieged by the royal army and its walls and chateau demolished.

During the revolution the commune was renamed Carla le peuple. After the monarchy was restored it was renamed Carla-Bayle in honor of Pierre Bayle. There is a museum devoted to Bayle and is home to many galleries and a number of artists.

<text>Mödling () is the capital of the Austrian district of the same name located approximately 15 km south of Vienna.

Mödling lies in Lower Austria&#x27;s industrial zone (Industrieviertel). The Mödlingbach, a brook which rises in the Vienna Woods, flows through the town. Near Achau it joins with the Schwechat. Woodland occupies a large part of the municipality, part of the Föhrenberge (&#x27;Pine Mountains&#x27;).

Located immediately south of Vienna, and within the boundaries of the district of Mödling, is one of the largest shopping centres in Europe: Shopping City Süd (SCS).

==Geography==


Grapes are grown on the slopes of the Wienerwald; the area is called &quot;Thermenregion&quot;, where one can find much &quot;Heurigen&quot; (the most recent year&#x27;s wine).

Wiener Neudorf to the east, and Maria Enzersdorf to the north, merge directly into Mödling. South of Mödling is Gumpoldskirchen, separated by the Eichkogel with its very special flora. In the west, a narrow street runs through Vorderbrühl, formally a village in its own rights, and leads to Hinterbrühl. This narrow valley is called Klausen, above it the remains of the Mödling castle, once belonging to the Babenberger, the then-ruling family. On the other side of the Klausen is the Kalenderberg, with the castle of Liechtenstein on its far side. The beginning of the Klausen is marked by the large red-brick aqueduct of the &quot;Erste Wiener Hochquellenwasserleitung&quot;. The steep, rocky valley sides of the &quot;Naturpark Föhrenberge&quot; grow the typical &quot;Wienerwald-Schwarzföhren&quot; (the &quot;austriaca&quot; form of the European Black Pine, &quot;Pinus nigra&quot;).

==History==

The settlement dates back to the Neolithic era. Through the centuries, the name of the town evolved from &quot;Medilihha&quot; to &quot;Medelikch&quot;, &quot;Medling&quot; and, finally, Mödling. These names trace back to old Slavic meaning &#x27;slowly running water&#x27;. 

Today there is a quaint old town with a pedestrian area. The town was the residence of a branch of the Babenberg family, as a result of which it received the nickname &quot;Babenbergerstadt&quot; (&#x27;Town of the Babenbergs&#x27;).

Traces of the first settlements of the Hallstatt culture from the Neolithic era were found on the Kalenderberg. Roman coins and a Roman burial site have been found near today&#x27;s railway station.

After Charlemagne&#x27;s victory in 803 AD against the Avars, the area around Mödling was settled by settlers from Bavaria. About 500 Avar graves were found in the area of the &quot;Goldene Stiege&quot; (very close to today&#x27;s old city).

The first ancient document mentioning &quot;MEDILIHHA ULTRA MONTEM COMMIGENIUM&quot; is dated 8 September 903, when two bishops (of the then Roman Catholic church) exchanged lands. However, in 907 the settlement seems to have been destroyed again. After the Battle of Lechfeld settlement in the area of today&#x27;s Mödling started again.

After this, for some time Mödling housed a relative of the then ruling House of Babenberg. In 1177, Henry the Elder, son of Henry II Jasomirgott, became landlord in an area reaching from Liesing to Piesting and Bruck an der Leitha. You can read this in old documents kept in the nearby monastery of Heiligenkreuz. In Henry&#x27;s days arts and culture dominated in the castle of Mödling; the famous minnesinger Walther von der Vogelweide stayed there more than once. The Spitalkirche and today&#x27;s St. Othmar were built in the 15th century, the Karner (charnel house) in the 12th.

Even in these times, Mödling grew grapes; after Langenlois, it was the largest grape-growing community in Lower Austria.

In 1343, Duke Albrecht II granted the rights of a market town to Mödling.

In 1529, the Ottomans devastated Mödling for the first time during their first siege of Vienna. In 1679, many citizens died of the Black Death. When the Ottomans came again in 1683, almost all the citizens of Mödling were killed. The second epidemic of the Black Death only brought death to 22 inhabitants, hence the survivors built the monument of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeits- or Pestsäule) at the Freiheitsplatz.

In the early 19th century, Ludwig van Beethoven often visited his favorite pub, the Three Ravens, in Mödling.

Arnold Schoenberg lived in Mödling between 1918 and 1925, and invented his twelve-tone technique of composition there.

On 18 November 1875, Mödling was designated a city.

From 1883 to 1932, Mödling was the starting point of the Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram, Austria&#x27;s first electric railway and world&#x27;s first long-lasting tram with overhead lines.

In 1938, after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Nazi Germany, Mödling was incorporated into the newly formed 24th District of Vienna. In 1954, it became once again a part of Lower Austria.

On May 30, 2023, 3 people were killed by fire at the local hospital.

==Traffic==

Mödling functions as a traffic hub for its direct vicinity. Bus lines connect the town and Südbahn with the surrounding areas. The Südbahn connects Mödling to Vienna, but also to other local centers like Wiener Neustadt by commuter trains.

Many bus lines end/start at Mödling&#x27;s railway station: Most of them lead to Vienna (with different ways) (207, 259, 260, 265, 266, 269, 270...) but also other villages in the district are destinations: Gießhübel (262), Hinterbrühl, Gaaden... (364, 365), Guntramsdorf (363) and many more.

The closest airport is Vienna International Airport.

The town lies close to several major motorways (A2, A23, S1).

Until the 1960s, the town was connected to the tram system of Vienna though the line 360 was discontinued after the commuter train system was introduced on the Südbahn. Historically, Mödling was the site of Austria&#x27;s first electrified tram line, which had mainly touristic use.

==Economy==
In the old days, because of the rail-connection to the north/Vienna and to the south, several large industries had their plants here. Today most of the firms are SMEs. The larger ones have moved to Wiener Neudorf into the &#x27;Industriezentrum Niederösterreich Süd&#x27;.

==Castles==
The Mödling area in the Vienna Forest contains many old castles () and ruins. Castle Liechtenstein is the most famous and biggest castle. It was owned by the wealthy family who later founded the country of the same name. Opposite the castle is Schloss Liechtenstein (Maria Enzersdorf), a former summer residence of the princely Liechtenstein family. Burgruine Mödling also stands nearby and is one of the oldest ruins in the area. It dates back to the 11th century. In addition, Black Tower (Schwarzer Turm) looks out over downtown Mödling from the Calendar mountains. It was built over 200 years ago, but is still privately occupied to this day. Lastly, on the walk between Black Tower and Castle Liechtenstein, one will come across a 200-year-old amphitheatre nearly buried in the woods. It was built in the same time frame as the Black Tower and served as an important cultural centre for the local Mödling population.

==Culture and sights==

The well-preserved and revitalized Old City is protected by the Hague Convention. The town hall holds the registry office. Because of its lovely environment many couples choose to marry here. Schrannenplatz and Kaiserin-Elisabeth-Strasse were pedestrianised at the very early date of 1976, the first time a &#x27;Bundesstraße&#x27; had been declared a pedestrian area.

Nearby is the Eichkogel Nature Reserve, with rare flora, like &#x27;Knollen-Brandkraut&#x27; (&quot;Phlomoides tuberosa&quot;) and others, on &#x27;Halbtrockenrasen&#x27;. Among the rocks in the Klausen rare plants grow, like the &#x27;Mödlinger Federnelke&#x27; (&quot;Dianthus plumarius&quot; subsp. &quot;neilreichii&quot;), which was discovered as late as the middle of the 19th century by the botanist August Neilreich, or the &#x27;Deutsche Alant&#x27; (&quot;Inula germanica&quot;).

<doc id="1128780" wikidata="Q2502365" url="?curid=1128780" title="Little America (exploration base)">
<text>Little America was a series of Antarctic exploration bases from 1929 to 1958, located on the Ross Ice Shelf, south of the Bay of Whales. The were built on ice that is moving very slowly, the relative location on the ice sheet, has moved and eventually breaks off into an iceberg. The geographic location has new ice that has shifted to this location, and is technically over the open water.

The coordinates are approximate.

==Little America I==

The first base in the series was established in January 1929 by Richard Byrd, and was abandoned in 1930.
This was where the film &quot;With Byrd at the South Pole&quot; (1930), about Byrd&#x27;s trip to the South Pole, was filmed.

==Little America II==

Little America II was established in 1934, some above the site of the original base, with some of the original base accessed via tunnel. This base was briefly set adrift in 1934, but the iceberg fused to the main glacier.

During the 1934–1935 expedition, many souvenir letters were sent from Little America, using a commemorative postage stamp issued by the U.S. government. The souvenir cancellation operations were conducted under extremely difficult conditions.

Little America established the first successful radio broadcasting from Antarctica, making regular broadcasts that could be picked up by household radio sets in the United States, more than away around the Earth&#x27;s curvature.

In a later expedition to Antarctica, Byrd&#x27;s expedition spotted Little America&#x27;s towers still standing, including the Jacobs Wind plant installed in 1933.

==Little America III==

Little America III was established for the 1940–1941 season, some to the north.

In 1940 a huge exploration vehicle, the Antarctic Snow Cruiser, was brought to Little America III. Unfortunately, the vehicle was found to have a number of design and technical weaknesses and was little used. Abandoned, it became buried in the snow. It was last rediscovered in 1958, but has subsequently been lost once again, either under the snow, or under the waters of the Southern Ocean.

The site of Little America III was carried to sea in 1963.

==Little America IV==

Little America IV was established in 1946–1947 as the primary camp for Operation Highjump. On 2 and 5 December 1946, 166 Seabees sailed from Port Hueneme on the USS &quot;Yancey&quot; and USS &quot;Merrick&quot; assigned to Operation Highjump.

==Little America V==

Little America V was established on January 3, 1956, at Kainan Bay, some east of Little America IV, as part of Operation Deep Freeze. Little America V served as the American base in the South Polar program in the International Geophysical Year, from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958. Little America V was constructed by United States Navy Seabees in the three-month window before the Antarctic winter makes construction nearly impossible. All of Little America V was constructed below the snow line in the ice, with individual living quarters, generator room, cafeteria, and with ramps leading out at one end for tracked vehicles. This type of construction meant that none of those staying in Little America V had to go outdoors in the harsh winter when going from one section to another of the Antarctic town.

The site of Little America V went to sea on Iceberg B-9 in 1987.

Little America V was one of seven bases that the United States built for the IGY, which also included McMurdo, Hallett, Wilkes, Admundsen-Scott (South Pole Station), Ellsworth, and Byrd.

<text>Ro-Busters is a British comic story that formed part of the original line-up of the magazine &quot;Starlord&quot;. Similar in premise to that of the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; television series, it was created by writer Pat Mills and was drawn by Carlos Pino and Ian Kennedy initially, before &quot;Starlord&quot;″s merger with &quot;2000 AD&quot;. After the merger, Dave Gibbons, Kevin O&#x27;Neill and Mike McMahon were regular artists on the series, along with occasional contributions from Mike Dorey.

Along with &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;, &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; survived &quot;Starlord&quot;″s merger with &quot;2000 AD&quot;, its sister comic at IPC Magazines Ltd. The series introduced the decommissioned war robot Hammerstein and the sewer robot Ro-Jaws, and gave rise to the popular &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; series.

==Mandate==
&quot;Robots are going to take over Man&#x27;s dirtiest jobs . . . clearing his garbage, tending his sick, even fighting his wars! By the year 2078 people will change their robots as today they change their cars. So step now through the slick plasto-glass doors of &quot;Flash&quot; Harry Lowder&#x27;s robo-mart in the year 2078 . . .&quot;

==Publication history==
The story was one of those aimed at being the core of the new title &quot;Starlord&quot;, a sister-comic to &quot;2000 AD&quot;. The concept was based on a suggestion from managing editor John Sanders and, according to writer Pat Mills &quot;I did this really as a favour and as a way of pissing off the managing editor who pitched an idea to me about ex-servicemen with super powers who deal with disasters. It was a dreadful idea and I bypassed it by doing Ro-Busters, which he hated – so I knew my story would be a hit&quot; Although he had stayed with &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and would go on to be the art editor there, Kevin O&#x27;Neill provided the initial designs for &quot;Ro-Buster&quot; but would only draw the series later after its move to &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

The stories were drawn by a number of artists and Dave Gibbons has fond memories of his work on &quot;Ro-Busters&quot;:

Hammerstein, Ro-Jaws and Mek-Quake would go on to be members of the ABC Warriors, first introduced in Hammerstein&#x27;s flashbacks to his time in the Volgan War.

After the launch of &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; Pat Mills did not write another &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; story for thirty-five years, but there were a number of one-offs published in the &quot;2000 AD Annual&quot; during the early eighties, most notable three stories by Alan Moore which were the last &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; tales.

==Overview==
&quot;Ro-Busters&quot; depicts a world where artificially intelligent robots are so ubiquitous they are treated with contempt by humans and there is a class hierarchy among the robots themselves. Ro-Busters is a commercial rescue organisation run by Howard Quartz, known as &quot;Mr. 10 Per Cent&quot; because 90% of him is robotic (a &#x27;person&#x27; must have at least 10% organic matter to qualify as human). Quartz uses robots to carry out his perilous rescue missions because no-one cares if they live or die. Any insubordination in the ranks is dealt with by his enforcer, the psychotic and stupid &quot;kill-dozer&quot; Mek-Quake. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein, the two main characters, are hugely courageous but after each successful mission they are usually greeted with indifference by the authorities.

When the owner of Ro-Busters decides to destroy the robots in an &#x27;accident&#x27; as a tax evasion measure, Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein lead an escape plot. Once free they learn that a robot underground exists and that a safe haven for free robots has been established on the Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. The Ro-Busters by this stage are being pursued by a ruthless police unit charged with suppressing robot liberation. A transport is arranged to take the robots to Titan but at the last moment the police close in so Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein with a few volunteers lead a seeming suicide mission to fight off the authorities and buy time for their comrades to escape. The mission is a success and Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein are seen dancing into the sunset.

The series has a high degree of satiric comment on contemporary life as Pat Mills had shown on other series. The corrupt and malicious police squad sent to capture the robots is a parody of the Special Patrol Group. Some claim the wilful destruction of a productive and loyal workforce reflects the effects of Thatcherism – though the storyline was already well underway before the first Thatcher government had been elected. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein&#x27;s names are a word play on the musical writing pairing of Rodgers and Hammerstein and the story also features a number of song and dance routines.

Ro-Busters would turn up in &quot;Savage Book Five&quot;, set in an alternate 2009; a human Howard Quartz and his Ro-Busters company designed the first ABC Warriors to liberate Volgan-occupied territories. Quartz was revealed to be the brother of the US vice-president Dick Quartz and a leading arms manufacturer; when the U.S. was neutral towards the Volgans, Quartz had secretly sold weapons to them via murky legal means.

<text>Abu al-Qasim Mahmud ibn Umar al-Zamakhshari (; 1074 –1143) was a medieval Muslim scholar of Iranian descent. He travelled to Mecca and settled there for five years and has been known since then as &#x27;Jar Allah&#x27; (God&#x27;s Neighbor). He was a Mu&#x27;tazilite theologian, linguist, poet and interpreter of the Quran. He is best known for his book Al-Kashshaf, which interprets and linguistically analyzes Quranic expressions and the use of figurative speech for conveying meaning. This work is a primary source for all major linguists.

== Biography ==
His full name was Abu Al-Qasim Mahmoud ibn Omar ibn Mohammed ibn Omar Al-Khawarizmi Al-Zamakhshari. He was also referred to as &quot;Fakhr Khawarizm&quot; (&quot;The Pride of Khwarazm&quot;) because people travelled to Khwarazm, a large oasis, to learn from him about the Quran and Arabic language. He was born on 18 March 1074 in Zamakhshar, which was a large city of Khwarazm at the time.

===Life===
Al-Zamakhshari grew up in Zamakhshar and studied there for a while, then he travelled to many places in Central Asia including the city of Bukhara in modern Uzbekistan, the Iranian cities of Khurasan and Isfahan, as well as Baghdad, where he met some political officials and praised them. The main reason for his travels was to learn more about poetry, religion and Arabic grammar. He travelled then to Makkah, where he met the prince at the time, Abi AlHasan Ali bin Hamzah bin Wahas Al-Shareef Al-Hasany, who had written extensively about Arabic prose and verse principles. After two years, Al-Zamakhshari went back to Khawarizim, but he could not resist his nostalgia for Makkah, the holy mosque, and his teachers there. So, he travelled again to Makkah and stayed for three years. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and then to Khawarizim where he died.

Al-Zamakhshari is reputed to have lost one of his legs, a fact that literature on his life explains variously. In one version of the story, Al-Damaghani stated that he asked Al-Zamakhshari about his leg, and he told him that when he was a child, he put a rope on a bird&#x27;s leg. So, when the bird attempted to fly, its leg was cut off. Al-Zamakhsari&#x27;s mother saw this and wished him the same, so he could feel the bird&#x27;s pain. Later, on his way to Bukhara, he fell off the horse and broke his leg, and it was later amputated. Others like Ibn Khalkan argued that his constant travels in the very cold weather of Khawarizm were the reason for his leg loss.

=== Teachers ===
Al-Zamakhshari learned a lot from the well-known teachers at the time. One of his teachers was Abu Mudhar Mahmoud ibn Jarir Al-Dhabi Al-Asfahani who was called by his peers Fareed Asruh: ‘the most brilliant scholar of his time’. He taught Al-Zamakhshari syntax and literature. Al-Zamakhashari highly appreciated this teacher and was distraught when he died in 1113. Furthermore, Al-Zamakhshari studied literature and prosody from Abu Ali Al-Hasan bin Al-Mudhaffar Al-Nisaburi. He also drew some of his philosophico-religious ideas from his teachers Abu Mansur Nasr Al-Harthi, Abu Sa’ad Al-Shaga’I, and Abu Al-Khattab bin Al-Batar. While in Makkah, he learned about rhetoric and morphosyntax from Abu al-Hussain ali ibn Hamzah bin Wahas, who in turn learned from Al-Zamakhshari about Quranic interpretations and the principles governing the use of literary devices used in Quran.

=== Students ===
Al-Qafti (1172–1248) wrote in his book Akhbar Al-Olama ‘Scholars’ Biographies’ that students followed Al-Zamakhsahri wherever he traveled in order to learn from him. They would travel for months just to find him. Among his students in Zamakhshar were Abu Omar and Amer bin Hasan Al-Simsar. In Tabaristan the mountainous region located in the Caspian coast of northern Iran he taught Abu Al-Mahasin Isma’il ibn Abdullah Al-Tawaili, and in Abiward, he taught Abdm AlRahim ibn Abd Allah Al-Barra. In Samarqand, some of his students were Ahmed ibn Mahmoud Al-Shati, Mohammad bin Abi Al-Qasim Al-Khawarizmi who was referred to as the top poet and syntactician of his time Abu Yusuf Ya’gub bin Ali Al-Balkhi a contributing linguist and poet, and Rashid Al-Din Al-Vatvat, a distinguished scholar in prose and verse.

=== Death ===
Al-Zamakhshari died in Gurgānj (known now as Konye-Urgench), the capital city of Turkmenistan, on 12 July 1143 AD (Monday, eve of 8th Dhu AlHijjah, 538 AH), aged 69.

== Linguistic approaches ==
Al-Zamakhshari was not exclusively committed to either the Basri nor the Kufi analytical approach over the other, but took from both what validated his hypotheses. Some attributed this linguistic behaviour to his Mu’tazalah philosophical ideas, which freed his soul and encouraged him to have a comprehensive perspective of life. Nevertheless, if there was a need to put his name under a specific school, then he would have followed the Baghdad school, whose approaches follow that of Al-Basri school in some cases while following Al-Kufi&#x27;s approaches in others. A teaching of the Basri school is regarding the verb in ((هل زيد قام؟ ‘Did Zayd stand?’ as a subject of an elided verb expressed by the verb قام ‘stand’. On the other hand, the Kufi school rejects viewing the noun as a subject, and argues that it is a topic. Another example showing where he followed the Kufi school is analyzing the verb حدّث ‘tell’ as a verb that takes three objects. As in, فمن حدثتموهـ له علينا العلاء ‘the one you told about the priority’, where the 1st object is ‘the one’, the 2nd is the attached pronoun to the verb هـ, and the 3rd is the prepositional phrase. However, the Basri school rejected this view and regarded ‘tell’ as a ditransitive verb.

== Accomplishments ==

=== &quot;Al-Kashshaf&quot; ===

&quot;Al-Kashshaf&quot; (a.k.a. &#x27;The Revealer; Quran Interpretation’) was written in the 12th century. It is the best known work of Al-Zamakhshari. Indeed, many linguists throughout history have attributed Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s fame to this book. The name of this book (Al-Kashshaf) is derived from the verb kashaf ‘to uncover’. Thus, this book attempts to uncover the syntactic and semantic ambiguities of Quranic expressions. In the text, Al-Zamakhshari explained his motivation, impetus and goals for constructing it. In fact, he once admitted that he was hesitant to write this book, as he thought he might not have the skills needed to interpret the Quran appropriately. He said that whenever he was teaching his students and mentioning a Quranic verse, his students seemed to learn new meanings they have never come across before. As he continued to do that, students were more interested in Quranic interpretation than in other subject matters. So, when he told them he would write a book about all those meanings, they could not wait and encouraged him.

This book begins with an introduction in which Al-Zamakhshari provides his readers with a brief autobiography and his rationale for composing the text. The following pages provide the resources used in this book. Then the book begins providing interpretations for Quranic verses in the exact order they appear in the Quran. The book then concludes with two pages where the editor provided a biography about Al-Zamakhshari and praised him as a respected figure whose contributions extended to the religious, linguistic, and literary aspects of life.

This book was a primary source for linguists as well as learners of Arabic and Quran, regardless of its Mu’tazile approach, a rationalist school of Islamic theology in Baghdad and AlBasrah. In fact, most of the following scholars used Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s stylistic, semantic and syntactic approaches when composing their works. In this book, Al-Zamakhshari tried to show the beauty and richness of the Arabic language, derive proverbs, explain expressions with multiple meanings, and dive into the science of rhetoric.

Among the features that distinguish this book is its understandable language even for learners of Arabic and its lack of redundancy. Another feature is that it depends on Arab speakers’ styles of communicating meanings and using their figurative speech. Moreover, the method of explanation followed the question/answer pattern, starting with ‘if I told you…. What would you say?’ and the answer would be ‘I say….’. Ibn Khaldun (1332 –1406) in &quot;Al-Muqadimah&quot; ‘The Introduction’ (1377) says that this interrogative style is what made it easier to follow for readers of different educational backgrounds.

After the great fame that this book enjoyed, many scholars wrote commentaries, such as Al-Imam Nasser Al-Deen Ahmed bin Mohammed ibn Al-Mouneer who wrote Al-Intissaf ‘Equality’, Kamal Basha Al-Mufty, Khair Ad-Deen Khidhr Al-A’utufi, Sun’u Allah ibn Ja’afar Al-Mufty and Alam Ad-Deen Abd Al-Kareem bin Ali Al-Iraqi. Others preferred to summarize it, such as Mohammad bin Ali Al-Ansari, Nasser Al-Deen Omar bin Abdullah Al-Bidhawi, Qutub Ad-Deen Mohammed bin Masoud Al-Syrafi and Abd AlAwwal bin Hussain, who was known as Om Walad.

=== &quot;Al-Mofassal Fi Sina’at Al-E’rab&quot; ===

Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s &quot;Al-Mofassal Fi Sina’at Al-E’rab&quot; ‘Detailed Analyses of Arabic Parsing’ (1120 – 1122 AD) is considered by Arabic grammarians to be one of the most influential books about Arabic syntax (and morphosyntax). Indeed, some grammarians believed that it is the second syntactic book after Sibawayh&#x27;s books on Arabic grammar because Al-Zamakhshari talked about every syntactic and morphological aspect of the Arabic language. He started writing this book towards the end of 513 AH and finished it at the beginning of 515 AH (1122 AD), which means that it did not take him more than a year and four months. This work has been celebrated throughout history by different linguists and was translated in the modern era to different languages, such as German in 1873.

Al-Zamakhshari believed that interpreting the Quran was not an easy task. This seemed only possible for educated linguists whose language is pure Arabic, and who have achieved a deep knowledge of the different syntactic and semantic relations that different structures could bear. Indeed, he believed that trying to interpret the Quran without having linguistic knowledge might result in a false interpretation of God&#x27;s intended meanings and cause further problems, as the Quran is the major source upon which all life matters are based. Since the language of the Quran is Arabic, Al-Zamakhshari thought that writing this book would help people better grasp the richness of the Arabic language and better understand its different interpretations.

Knowing that Al-Zamakhshari was a voracious reader, he might have looked at some syntactic books of other great grammarians and might have considered them disorganized. Thus, he intended to provide a better organization of the syntactic and morphological aspect of Arabic grammar to facilitate understanding, an aim he stated at the beginning of his book. So, he began his book with a brief introduction writing about the reasons that motivated him to come up with this work, then he divided his book into four major chapters, as follows:

According to Grodzki (2011), what distinguishes &quot;Al-Mofassal Fi Sina’at Al-E’rab&quot; from other Arabic syntactic books is Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s attempt to avoid digression to allow his readers to follow smoothly, which is the result of giving each topic its deserved time and space. He considered Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s style to be clear, simple, and succinct. He also believed that Al-Zamakhshari did not attempt to extensively explain his ideas unless they addressed grammatical issues raised in the Quran or poetry, in which case he provided his readers with detailed explanations.

This linguistic work enjoyed attention since the time it saw the light. Many linguists and scientists wrote books explaining, comparing, or commenting on this work. Jurji Zaydan once wrote in his 1943 book &quot;Tarikh Adab Al-Lughah Al-Arabiyyah&quot; ‘History of Arabic Language Literature’ that the reason Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s &quot;Al-Muffassal&quot; was accepted by people is that King Issa Ibn Ayyob — who was a syntactician — admired this book and assigned 100 Dinar and a house to whoever memorized it. Moreover, this book was one of the (few and) most influential books taught in Al-Sham (Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine), Egypt, Iraq, Al-Hijaz (the Western part of Saudi Arabia) and Yemen throughout the 7th and 8th centuries AH (1204 – 1301 AD). Indeed, its influence went further to reach Al-Andalus (the Iberian Peninsula) where people were also interested in the Arabic language.

=== &quot;Asas Al-Balaghah&quot; ===
&quot;Asas Al-Balaghah&quot; ‘The Foundation of Eloquence’ (first published in 1998) is a thesaurus and dictionary of Arabic words. For each word, Al-Zamakhshari provided its meaning, some of its uses in the Quran, Muhammad&#x27;s sayings, poetry, or proverbs. Furthermore, he represented and analyzed some uses of this word in figurative speech and provided contexts where it can be found in everyday language. The content of this text was organized alphabetically. This work was best known as the earliest fully alphabetical lexicography that combines literal definitions and metaphorical material. He excluded rare or borrowed words. His goal was to highlight that word choice can play a significant role in enhancing the rhetoric of a text or speech.

=== &quot;Maqamat Al-Zamakhshari&quot; ===
&quot;Maqamat Al-Zamakhshari&quot; ‘Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s Principles’ (first published in 1982) is a literary work. It began with an introduction praising God for all his blessings and asking readers to carefully read this book and understand the purpose behind the use of each word. Al-Zamakhshari then provided a religious sermon followed by his fifty principles. Those principles talked about different topics. Some of them were about generosity, seriousness, bravery, thanking, advice-giving, death, syntax, prosody, and the life of Arabs in the past.

== Assessments ==
Some of the 7th and 8th centuries scholars have attributed different points of view to Al-Zamakhshari on different topics. However, some books and other historical pieces of evidence from the 7th century showed that some of these views attributed to him were not based on sound ground and that most judgments lacked supporting evidence. One of the competing claims about Al-Zamakhshari is his analysis of the co-occurrence of the interrogative prefix /ʔ-/ with the conjunction words in Arabic, especially in Quranic verses.

=== Interrogative particle &quot;al-hamza&quot; /ʔ-/ ===
In Arabic, the interrogative prefix /ʔ-/ attaches to nominal and verbal sentences to form a yes/no question. Thus, it is used to check information and ask for confirmation or verification. Most of the time, it is prioritized in a sentence, so it may precede conjunction particles, prepositions, the complementizer [ʔnna] and direct objects (in case of verbal sentences). Indeed, this prefix is viewed as the default interrogative in Arabic. However, other interrogative particles (which are used to ask yes/no questions or those similar to English wh-question words) usually follow conjunctions, namely [wa], [fa] and [θumma], as in:

(فهل يهلك إلَا القوم الفاسقون)

Fa hal yuhlaku illa ʔal-qawm-u ʔal-fasiqu:n

CONJ. INTROG. destroy-PRES except DEF-people-NOM DEF-immoral

“Shall any be destroyed except those who transgress?” (The Quran, 46:35) 

When using the interrogative bound morpheme /ʔ-/, most of the time that it precedes any conjunctions, as in:

(أو كلَما عاهدوا عهداً)

ʔ-wa kull-ma ʕahad-u ʕahd-an

INTROG-CONJ every-time promise(V)-3rd Pl promise-Acc

 “Has it not always been so that every time they made a covenant?” (The Quran, 2:100) 

In this view, Arabic syntacticians had different analyses: some of them like Sibawahi (as well as some other Arab linguists of Al-Basrah) believed that when this interrogative prefix precedes conjunctions, it appears in its default position, but may sometimes follow conjunctions. They also believed that the sentence after the conjunction is conjoined to the sentence before both the conjunction particle and the interrogative suffix.

Al-Zamakhshari had another opinion. He was among a group who believed that the default position of the interrogative particle is sentence-initially but argued that the sentence after the conjunction is conjoined to an elided sentence between the interrogative prefix and the conjunction particle. In his book, &quot;Al-Kashshaf&quot;, he brought many examples and tried to account for the elliptical structures they had. For example, he believed that a question like (أفلم يسيروا؟) which translates as “and have not they travelled?&quot; is a surface representation of the original structure (أمكثوا فلم يسيروا؟) which translates as “Have they stayed, and not traveled?”

In light of this, Ibn Hisham an 8th-century Egyptian grammarian argued that Al-Zamakhshari was the first one to make this analysis, arguing for an elliptical structure between the interrogative prefix and the conjunction particle. On the other hand, Abu Hayyan a 10th-century linguist and philosopher agreed with Sibawahi and strongly rejected Al-Zamakhsahri&#x27;s analysis, and indeed called it the “Zamakhshariyyan trend”.

Still, another linguist known as Al-Dosugi disagreed with Ibn Hisham&#x27;s view that Al-Zamakhshari was the first one to come up with this analysis; rather, he was convinced that Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s analysis is a follow-up of what other earlier linguists had already discussed, but Al-Dosugi was not sure who first came up with this analysis. This view seemed to have a supporting piece of evidence because Ibn Hayyan said that Mohammad bin Masoud Al-Ghazni argued for an elided verbal phrase between the interrogative prefix and the conjunction particle, but the literature about this linguist and his analytical approaches seem to be very limited. Nevertheless, historical references showed that he (i.e., Mohammad bin Masoud Al-Ghazni) died in 1029 AD, whereas Al-Zamakhshari was born in 1074 AD. This verifies what Al-Dosugi argued for and proves that Al-Zamakhshari was a follower, not an initiator, of this analytical approach.

=== Zamakhsharyyan &quot;Lan&quot; ===
Zamakhsharyyan &quot;Lan&quot; ‘Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s Negation’ was another topic that divided scholars to agree or disagree with him. In his view, Al-Zamakhshari defined the negation particle &quot;lan&quot; as a particle that negates present tense verbs with present and future references. To him, it is like ‘never’ in English where it has a sense of continuous negation, i.e., where negation extends beyond the present to negate any possible chances for a particular event or state to take place in the future (cf. He is not married. He will never get married). Al-Zamakhshari gave various examples to validate his analysis, such as:

1). When Prophet Mousa asked God if he could see Him, God replied:

(لن تراني)

lan t-aran-i

NEG 3rd Sg.PRES-see-OBJ.PRO

“You will never see me” (The Quran, 7:143) 

2). When God said that those whom people invoke besides Him will never be able to create a fly even if they gathered together for that purpose:

(لن يخلقوا ذباباً)

lan ya-khlouq-ou thobab-an

NEG PRES-create-3rd PL fly-ACC

“They can never create a fly” (The Quran, 22:73) 

However, some 8th century scholars such as Ibn Hisham believed that Al-Zamakhsari regarded &quot;lan&quot; as a continuous negation particle because he was deeply influenced by the philosophical ideas of his Mu’tazile approach. That is because this is the way the Mu’tazile people interpret the Quran, which is not the way all other Muslims do. For instance, example (1) above shows how Mu’tazile people believe that they will never be able to see God in the afterlife, and this is the approach Al-Zamakhshari followed in his semantic and syntactic analysis of the Quran. However, all Muslims (who do not follow the Mu&#x27;tazile approach), believe the opposite, as it is actually stated in the Quran that believers will ,indeed, be able to see God:

وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَاضِرَةٌ * إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ ﴾ [القيامة: 22، 23]﴿

&quot;Some faces, that Day, will beam (in brightness and beauty) * Looking towards their Lord&quot; (The Quran, 75: 22,23) 

As for &quot;lan&quot;, Ibn Hisham also had a different opinion, as he regarded it as a normal negative particle that does not bear a continuous negation sense. He defended his view by some examples from the Quran, as follows:

3). When God said about the disbelievers that they will never wish to die:

(لن يتمنوه أبداً)

Lan ya-tamana-au-hu abad-an

NEG PRES-wish-3rd PL-OBJ.PRO never-ACC

“They will never long for it” (The Quran, 2:95) 
In this example, Ibn Hisham argued against Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s view because he believed that if &quot;lan&quot; had a continuous negation sense, then it would be redundant to say &quot;abadanan&quot; ‘never’ in the same verse, which is never the case. So, this proves that &quot;lan&quot; acts as a normal negative particle, like ‘not’ in English.

4). When God asked Mary to tell people that she vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious (Allah), so she shall not speak to any human being:

(فلن أكلم اليوم إنسياً)

f-lan u-kalim al-yaoum insiy-an

then-NEG 1st SG.PRES-speak DEF-day human-ACC

“So, I shall not speak to any human being today” (The Quran, 19:26) 

In this example, Ibn Hisham also refuted Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s view because if &quot;lan&quot; meant ‘never’, then why its meaning would be constricted by the time adverbial word ‘today’ in the same verse? This again proved that Al-Zamkhsahri&#x27;s analysis of &quot;lan&quot; as a continuous negator is not applicable and is mainly affected by his theological ideas.

<doc id="1128814" wikidata="Q5432297" url="?curid=1128814" title="Falling A Records">
<text>Falling A Records is a British Essex, England-based independent record label, founded in the late 1970s by Barry Lamb and Peter Ashby., born out of the D.I.Y cassette movement. It owned a shop in Clacton-on-Sea which sold new and second hand records, distributed fanzines such as New Crimes, Vague, Vox, Flipside, Juniper beri-beri, Blam!, and D.I.Y magazines/comics including the very first copies of &quot;Viz&quot;. It also distributed leaflets for various causes such as &quot;anti-apartheid&quot; and &quot;anti-vivisection&quot;, music and politics being interlinked at the time.

It had a roster of several bands on its own label, such as the insane picnic &quot;(sic)&quot;, Standing Ovation and Spasmodic Caress, as well as cassettes and some vinyl it distributed for other D.I.Y cassette labels including Cause for Concern, Subway, Adventures in Reality, Music for Midgets, Third Mind and Colortapes. Many notable bands were distributed by Falling A, including The Cleaners from Venus featuring Martin Newell, the Modern Art, Attrition, The Pastels, The Membranes and Wavis O&#x27;Shave (also known as Foffo Spearjig). Some exclusive material was recorded for Falling A by The Cleaners from Venus and Foffo Spearjig among others.

In 1985, the cassette culture was threatening the fabric of the established music industry, and Falling A&#x27;s profile was such that it received the largest write up in the annual &quot;Music Week&quot; directory of UK record labels, even more words than EMI.

The label is still in existence as of July 2021. It is currently reissuing back catalogue on CD while releasing new music and creating a vast archival resource from all the memorabilia, ephemera and past product in its vaults.

<doc id="1128817" wikidata="Q253626" url="?curid=1128817" title="Jun Ji-hyun">
<text>Wang Ji-hyun (; born 30 October 1981), known professionally as Jun Ji-hyun (), is a South Korean actress and model. She rose to fame with her role in the romantic comedy film &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot; (2001), which became a tremendous sensation across Asia and sparked an international breakthrough for Korean cinema. Other notable films include &quot;Il Mare&quot; (2000), &quot;Windstruck&quot; (2004), &quot;The Thieves&quot; (2012), &quot;The Berlin File&quot; (2013) and &quot;Assassination&quot; (2015). She also starred in the popular television series &quot;My Love from the Star&quot; (2013–2014) and &quot;The Legend of the Blue Sea&quot; (2016–2017), as well as the Netflix series &quot;Kingdom&quot; (2021).

Jun has received multiple awards, including two Best Actress trophies at the Grand Bell Awards and a Grand Prize for Television at the Baeksang Arts Awards. Her success in film and television has established her as a top Hallyu star. She is referred to as one of &quot;The Troika,&quot; along with Kim Tae-hee and Song Hye-kyo, collectively known by the acronym &quot;Tae-Hye-Ji&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jun was born in Gangnam District, Seoul, South Korea. She has a brother who is five years older. Her mother and her mother&#x27;s friends all encouraged her to be a model or actress due to her height and slim figure. Her childhood dream was to become a flight attendant, but she changed her mind after a flight. In 1997, at the age of 16, she followed her high school female senior and began her career as a model for &quot;Ecole Magazine&quot;. In 1998, she debuted as an actress and adopted the stage name Jun Ji-hyun, at the suggestion of a producer.

Jun attended college at Dongguk University and graduated in 2004 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Theater and Film. She later enrolled in Dongguk University&#x27;s graduate school of Digital Media and Contents in 2011 and obtained a master&#x27;s degree.

==Career==
===1997–2005: Career beginnings and breakthrough===
Jun first became well known as a commercial model and as a TV actress. Although she made her film debut in the little-watched &quot;White Valentine&quot; in 1999, it was not until later in the year when she was featured in a commercial for Samsung My Jet Printer that she became a popular sensation. The dancing and attitude expressed in the ad made her into an icon for Koreans in their late teens and early twenties.

The following year, Jun made her first well-publicized film appearance in late 2000 with &quot;Il Mare&quot;, a handsomely shot melodrama set on Ganghwa Island. The film did respectably well at the box office (despite opening on the same day as blockbuster &quot;Joint Security Area&quot;) and solidified her status as a star. It was later remade in Hollywood under the title &#x27;Lake House&#x27; for the first time in a Korean film starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves.

Jun&#x27;s breakout film was comedy &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot;, a tale of a gullible college student and his slightly unhinged girlfriend. Jun&#x27;s &quot;sassy, loud, and domineering character while also embodying traits of a pure-hearted girl&quot; ran contrary to gender norms in Asia. The film became the highest grossing Korean comedy of all time in Korea and also spent two weeks at No. 1 in Hong Kong, launching Jun into pan-Asia stardom as one of the biggest Hallyu stars in the Chinese-language market. The huge success of &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot; also solidified Jun&#x27;s domestic popularity, and she was given the title of the &quot;Nation&#x27;s First Love&quot;. Jun&#x27;s growing popularity resulted in many companies requesting her endorsement. She also won the Best Actress award at the 2002 Grand Bell Awards.

In 2003, Jun starred in the psychological thriller film &quot;The Uninvited&quot;, which was rather well received by critics but failed to catch on with viewers. Throughout this time she was a constant presence in TV ads and on billboards in Korea and also in other Asian countries.

She reunited with Kwak Jae-yong, the director of &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot;, in 2004, appearing as a policewoman in romantic comedy &quot;Windstruck&quot;. However, viewers felt her role was too similar to &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot;. There were also signs that her popularity had started to suffer because of overexposure in advertisements. Nonetheless, &quot;Windstruck&quot; became the best-performing Korean film in Japan at the time, where &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot; was not as well known. In a 2005 survey of influential movie producers, she was ranked among the top ten most bankable stars in Korea.

Jun&#x27;s next project &quot;Daisy&quot; teamed her with Jung Woo-sung (who frequently appeared together with her in Giordano and 2% Lotte Chilsung Water advertisements), and drew attention for its 100% location shooting in the Netherlands, and for using the Hong Kong director Andrew Lau (&quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;).

===2006–2010: Hollywood debut===
In late 2006, it was announced that Jun would be making her long-predicted jump to Hollywood as the lead role in &quot;&quot;. She went through three months of hard training to play the sword-wielding martial arts heroine. During the filming and promotions for the movie prior to its 2009 release, she adopted the Westernized name Gianna Jun. Jun then launched her own luxury jeans brand in 2008, named &quot;Gianna by True Religion&quot;, her first celebrity line. She was reportedly involved in every stage of their production, from design to deciding on fit and wash and their decoration with accessories.

For the film &quot;A Man Who Was Superman&quot;, Jun cut off her signature long silky hair to play a cynical documentary producer who meets an odd, Hawaiian-shirt-clad modern-day hero who battles urban apathy and preaches the virtues of lending a hand. Of initially feeling pressured at the opportunity to work with acclaimed actor Hwang Jung-min, she said, &quot;Although luck was probably involved, I think it&#x27;s destiny for an actor to &#x27;meet&#x27; new work. On the first day I met him, I realized that I have much to learn from him, not only from his acting, but also as an individual.&quot;

In 2010, she acted opposite Chinese actress Li Bingbing in the English-language film &quot;Snow Flower and the Secret Fan&quot;, based on Lisa See&#x27;s bestselling novel of the same name, which was directed by Wayne Wang (&quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;). The film, set in remote 19th-century China, features the lifelong friendship between two women, Lily and Snow Flower, and their imprisonment imposed by the strict cultural codes of conduct for women at that time. She was photographed by Annie Leibovitz for the July issue of the American edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;, the first Korean actress to be included in the iconic fashion magazine.

===2012–present: Career resurgence and return to television===
As part of the star-studded cast of &quot;The Thieves&quot;, Jun was a scene stealer in Choi Dong-hoon&#x27;s 2012 heist film about thieves from Korea and China who team up together to steal a diamond worth , which is locked in a special room at a casino in Macau. &quot;The Thieves&quot; became the second top-selling Korean film of all time.

She next played a translator married to a North Korean intelligence agent in the 2013 spy thriller &quot;The Berlin File&quot;, and director Ryoo Seung-wan praised Jun&#x27;s action scenes and her North Korean dialect. Jun&#x27;s success on the big screen reaffirmed her status as one of the top actresses in Korea, as well as being one of the biggest box office draw in chungmuro.

14 years after &quot;Happy Together&quot; in 1999, Jun made her highly anticipated return to television in fantasy romance &quot;My Love from the Star&quot;, opposite her &quot;The Thieves&quot; co-star Kim Soo-hyun. Jun plays a present-day top actress who falls in love with an alien who landed on earth 400 years ago during the Joseon period, played by Kim. The series was a ratings success, sparking trends in fashion, make-up and restaurants. Jun won the &quot;Daesang&quot; (or &quot;Grand Prize&quot;), the highest award for television, at the 2014 Baeksang Arts Awards and the 2014 SBS Drama Awards. The drama reestablished Jun as a leader of the Hallyu, and she was given the President&#x27;s Award at the Korean Popular Culture and Arts Awards.

In 2015, she reunited with director Choi Dong-hoon for &quot;Assassination&quot;, an espionage action film set during the 1930s colonial era in which she played a sniper who assembles a squad of independence fighters to kill a Japanese army commander and a pro-Japanese Korean business tycoon. The film was another box-office success for Choi and Jun; &quot;Assassination&quot; was the highest-grossing Korean film of the year as well as the seventh all-time highest-grossing film in Korean cinema history. Jun was awarded Best Actress at the Grand Bell Awards and Max Movie Awards.

In January 2016, Korean entertainment and media company CJ E&amp;M acquired her agency Culture Depot. The same year, Jun was ranked 8th on &quot;Forbes&quot; Korea Power Celebrity 40. It was her second consecutive year in the top 10, having been ranked 4th in 2015.

In November 2016, Jun made her small-screen comeback in the SBS fantasy romance drama &quot;The Legend of the Blue Sea&quot; with Lee Min-ho, reuniting with &quot;My Love from the Star&quot; scriptwriter Park Ji-eun. Jun ranked 9th on Gallup Korea&#x27;s list of the 10 best actors of 2016, becoming the only woman to be included.

In March 2020, Jun made a short appearance in the second season of the Netflix period zombie thriller &quot;Kingdom&quot;. She was later confirmed to reprise her role and lead the series&#x27; sidequel &quot;Kingdom: Ashin of the North&quot;, alongside her &quot;Assassination&quot; co-star Park Byung-eun. The Netflix special episode was released worldwide on 23 July 2021.

In April 2020, Jun was confirmed to lead tvN mystery thriller drama &quot;Jirisan&quot;, written by &quot;Kingdom&quot; screenwriter Kim Eun-hee, opposite Ju Ji-hoon. The series premiered on 23 October 2021. Jun&#x27;s 2021 projects marked her small-screen comeback after nearly 5 years of hiatus.

In May 2022, an official from Culture Depot said that her agency&#x27;s contract expires in June 2022. Later, in August Jun has signed with new agency, Ieum Hashtag.

== Other activities ==

===Philanthropy===
In 2014, Jun donated million to the Korean Red Cross Society for the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. She continued making donations of million to the Hope Bridge Disaster Relief Association, to aid efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and to help victims of the wildfire that had started in Uljin, Gyeongbuk in 2022.

===Endorsements===
Jun is one of the most in-demand celebrity endorsers in South Korea. In 2014, she earned an estimated from advertising and endorsement fees. Market research in that same year showed that based on the value of real estate holdings, she ranked first among South Korean female celebrities, and fourth out of both male and female. In 2016, Jun earned ₩14 billion for the 14 commercials she has filmed, regaining her position at the top of advertisement rankings.

A lipstick she wore on &quot;My Love from the Star&quot;, YSL &quot;Rouge Pur Couture No. 52&quot; sold out worldwide, while the same coat she wore on the show caused a surge in sales of over 2,500 in ShesMiss stores in ten days.

In 2015, Jun has been selected by Italian luxury fashion house Gucci as the new face for the brand&#x27;s Asia exclusive Spring/Summer 2015 Accessories Campaign. The campaign shot in minimalistic aesthetic style, features Gucci accessories bearing its icons - the Horsebit, the Interlocking Gs and Gucci Flora and photographs taken by Sølve Sundsbø in London.

In February 2020, LG Household &amp; Health Care had selected her as the new global ambassador of luxury beauty brand SU:M37.

==Personal life==
===Marriage===
Jun married Choi Joon-hyuk on 13 April 2012, at Shilla Hotel in Jangchung-dong, central Seoul, with more than 600 guests, including celebrities, close friends and family attending the wedding. Choi, a banker, is the grandson of famed hanbok designer Lee Young-hee and the son of fashion designer Lee Jung-woo. Congratulatory money from the wedding was donated to charity.

She and Choi have two sons together, born in 2016 and 2018.

===Legal===
Jun along with six other Korean stars (Jung Woo-sung, Kim Sun-a, Jo In-sung, Ji Jin-hee, Cha Tae-hyun and Yang Jin-woo) sued the monthly movie magazine &quot;Screen&quot; in 2006 for commercially using their pictures without permission. The Seoul Central District Court ruled in 2007 that the publisher must pay from to to each star for infringing on their publicity rights.

In 2009, police discovered that Jun&#x27;s cell phone had been illegally cloned. Seoul Metropolitan Police arrested a private detective, identified as Kim, who testified that it was ordered by SidusHQ (Jun&#x27;s then agency of 13 years), for which he was paid in cash by the brother of the agency&#x27;s founder and then CEO Jung Hoon-tak. Police said Jun&#x27;s management company used the cloned phone to keep tabs on her in an attempt to exert control over all aspects of her life. SidusHQ denied the allegations. Jung Hoon-tak was later cleared after police could not find any concrete evidence of his direct involvement. Kim was sentenced to one year in prison for invasion of privacy, Jung&#x27;s brother received suspended jail terms. Because of the scandal, many expected her to leave once her contract expired, but she surprisingly extended her contract with SidusHQ for one more year. Then in 2011 she set up her own management agency, J&amp;Co. Entertainment, before moving to Culture Depot, an agency owned by a close friend, in 2012.

In 2011, SidusHQ CEO Jung Hoon-tak was accused of illegally using Jun&#x27;s bank account to pocket profits from a merger and acquisition. Jung allegedly made after purchasing a stake in the junior KOSDAQ-listed Stom E&amp;F in 2009 with an account under Jun&#x27;s name and announcing through a public filing several months later that he would buy Stom E&amp;F. Jung and Stom E&amp;F&#x27;s former CEO Kwon Seung-shik were reported for gaining unfair profits by leaking information on the M&amp;A beforehand. In an investigation by the Financial Supervisory Service, Jun testified that she was unaware of such an account existing under her name. Jung issued a denial.

<text>Andromeda I is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) about 2.40 million light-years away in the constellation Andromeda. Andromeda I is part of the local group of galaxies and a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It is roughly 3.5 degrees south and slightly east of M31. As of 2005, it is the closest known dSph companion to M31 at an estimated projected distance of ~40 kpc or ~150,000 light-years.

Andromeda I was discovered by Sidney van den Bergh in 1970 with the Mount Palomar Observatory 48-inch telescope. Further study of Andromeda I was done by the WFPC2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope. This found that the horizontal branch stars, like other dwarf spheroidal galaxies were predominantly red. From this, and the abundance of blue horizontal branch stars, along with 99 RR Lyrae stars detected in 2005, lead to the conclusion there was an extended epoch of star formation. The estimated age is approximately 10 Gyr. The Hubble telescope also found a globular cluster in Andromeda I, being the least luminous galaxy where such a cluster was found.

<text>Michael Vaillancourt Aris (27 March 1946 – 27 March 1999) was a British historian who wrote and lectured on Bhutanese, Tibetan, and Himalayan culture and history. He was the husband of Aung San Suu Kyi, who would later become State Counsellor of Myanmar.

==Life==
Aris was born in Havana, Cuba, son of British Council officer John Arundel Aris and Josette, daughter of Emile Vaillancourt, Canadian Ambassador to Cuba.

He was educated at Worth School in Sussex, and read modern history at Durham University, where he was a member of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society. After graduating in 1967, he spent six years as a private tutor to the children of the Bhutanese royal family.

In 1976, Aris moved on to the University of Oxford and became a junior research fellow and a member of the university faculty at St John&#x27;s College. In 1978, he obtained a Ph.D. in Tibetan literature from SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies). Later at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, he became a senior research fellow at the Asian Studies Centre. In the last years before his death, he helped establish a specialist Tibetan and Himalayan studies centre at Oxford.

Michael Aris&#x27;s identical twin brother, Anthony Aris, similarly became a scholar of Tibetan studies, and founded &quot;Serindia Publications&quot; to focus on bringing Tibetan history and culture to modern audiences.

== Relationship with Aung San Suu Kyi==
Having met at university, Aris and Aung San Suu Kyi were married in a Buddhist ceremony in 1972. After spending a year in Bhutan, they settled in North Oxford, where they raised their two sons, Alexander Aris and Kim Aris. During this time, Aris pursued his postgraduate studies at SOAS and obtained a PhD in Tibetan literature in 1978. In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to care for her mother, but later to lead the country&#x27;s pro-democracy movement. St John&#x27;s College provided Aris with an extended leave of absence as a fellow on full stipend so that he could lobby for his wife&#x27;s cause.

In 1997, Aris was diagnosed with prostate cancer which was later found to be terminal. Several countries, prominent individuals and organisations – including the United States government, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II – made appeals to the Burmese authorities to issue a visa for Aris. The Burmese government however refused this request, claiming a lack of adequate healthcare facilities and instead urging Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. Although Suu Kyi was at the time temporarily relieved from house arrest, she was unwilling to depart. Not trusting the junta&#x27;s assurances, she feared her re-entry would be refused upon her return.

In the ten years following his wife&#x27;s first house arrest in 1989, Aris would only see Suu Kyi another five times before passing away in 1999. The last occasion of their meeting took place in Christmas 1995, when Suu Kyi had been released from house arrest.

==Death==
Aris died of prostate cancer on his 53rd birthday in 1999, in Oxford.

<text>Minyon Moore (born May 16, 1958) is an American political activist and civil servant. Moore is the founder of Women Building for the Future, and heads Dewey Square Group&#x27;s state and local practice.
She is chairperson of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, Illinois.
She was formerly chief executive officer and before that chief operating officer of the Democratic National Committee, and before that, assistant to the President of the United States, director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, and director of White House political affairs under President Bill Clinton.

Previously, Moore worked as an advisor to the presidential campaigns of Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988. She also served as Governor Michael Dukakis&#x27; national deputy field director.

Moore was a senior political consultant to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, and was considered a member of her inner circle, &quot;Hillaryland&quot;. Moore was called a &quot;trusted voice&quot; in Clinton&#x27;s circle when she began her 2016 campaign for president.

Moore is on the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s executive committee. On February 21, 2015, they unanimously voted to adopt a resolution calling for &quot;Right to Vote&quot; Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to explicitly guarantee an citizen&#x27;s right to vote. She is also on the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation&#x27;s board of directors.

==Life==
Moore was born in Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from Boston University&#x27;s Film School with a certificate in digital film-making and sits on the board of the Writers’ Guild Foundation with leaders in the film and television industry such as Shonda Rhimes, Matthew Weiner, and Sally Wilcox.

Together with Donna Brazile, Leah Daughtry, Tina Flournoy and Yolanda Caraway, Moore is a member of the informal group the &quot;Colored Girls,&quot; described by political columnist Matt Bai as &quot;several African-American women who had reached the highest echelons of Democratic politics.&quot; Governor Howard Dean, former chair of the DNC, who had one of his dinners with the Colored Girls on the night of the 2014 midterm elections, said their perspective was important. &quot;They&#x27;re very rare Washington insiders who understand the rest of the country,&quot; Mr. Dean said. &quot;That&#x27;s part of what makes them so valuable. These women have not lost their connections with where they came from.&quot; In 2018, Moore, Brazile, Daughtry, and Caraway published &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics&quot;, a joint memoir and history of their time in politics.

On September 5, 2020, Moore was announced as a member of the advisory council of the Biden-Harris Transition Team, which planned the presidential transition of Joe Biden.

==Awards==
Moore was named as a Most Influential Leader by Rainbow Push in December, 2014.

In 2001, &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine named her as one of the 100 Most Powerful Women in Washington.

Winner of the Tin Cup award by Washington Government Relations Group for her &quot;proven commitment to the enrichment of African American government relations professionals&quot;.

Honored with the Spirit of Democracy Award from the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, award given to leaders who are unselfishly dedicated to education, social and economic justice.

Winner of the Uncommon Height Award: Each year an Uncommon Height Award is presented to one or more individuals who have achieved uncommon heights in excellence of service to others.

<text>Jesse Billauer (born February 24, 1979) is a well-known surfer from Pacific Palisades, California.

Billauer suffered an accident at the age of 17 on March 25, 1996, hitting his head on a shallow sandbar after being knocked off his surfboard by a wave. The force broke his neck, severing his spinal cord at the C6 level and instantly rendering him a quadriplegic.

Billauer was told by doctors that he would never surf again. However, Billauer eventually did return to surfing, adapting his surfing technique and equipment to the situation of his current condition, known as para surfing. He has become a role model to many other surfers, both professional and amateur, on how to live a life to the fullest, despite a life changing injury. Through these efforts, Jesse has gained sponsorships from companies including Hurley, Channel Islands Surfboards (who developed a &quot;Jesse Billauer&quot; model), LoFric, Wavejet and Shoe City.

After graduating from Malibu High School, Billauer eventually enrolled at San Diego State University with an emphasis in communications. He graduated in 2002. He is also a motivational speaker, and is executive director the nonprofit he founded, Life Rolls On. Through this foundation, Jesse is taking a leading role in awareness and activism for spinal cord injury related quality of life programs.

The 2003 documentary &quot;Step Into Liquid&quot; featured his story and his friendship with Rob Machado. Billauer was also featured on &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;While You Were Out&quot;, &quot;E! True American Story&quot;, and more. In 2004, he won the 10News Leadership Award for his commitment to the Life Rolls On Foundation. His life story is featured in the book &quot;Bouncing Forward: Transforming Bad Breaks into Breakthroughs&quot;.

In 2005, Billauer became the first quadriplegic surfer to surf the dangerous waves of Cloudbreak in Fiji. He now surfs utilizing a power-assisted surfboard created by Wavejet.

The inaugural &quot;Jesse&#x27;s Story on Tour&quot; speaking tour began in April 2006. Through the tour, he delivered his message of overcoming adversity to over 100,000 people.

In December 2006, Billauer broke his femur while surfing large waves on the North Shore of Oahu. This injury led to the development of improved equipment for disabled surfers. He has recovered and is back in the water surfing again.

In September 2013, he took over as executive director and CEO of Life Rolls On Foundation.

On October 26, 2014, Billauer married his longtime girlfriend, Samanta Pearson, at the historic Adamson House in Malibu.

<doc id="1128859" wikidata="Q338005" url="?curid=1128859" title="Acarbose">
<text>Acarbose (INN) is an anti-diabetic drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and, in some countries, prediabetes. It is a generic sold in Europe and China as Glucobay (Bayer AG), in North America as Precose (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), and in Canada as Prandase (Bayer AG).

Acarbose is a starch blocker. It works by inhibiting alpha glucosidase, an intestinal enzyme that releases glucose from larger carbohydrates such as starch and sucrose. It is composed of an acarviosin moiety with a maltose at the reducing terminus. It can be degraded by a number of gut bacteria.

Acarbose is cheap and popular in China, but not in the U.S. One physician explains that use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence. However, a large study concluded in 2013 that &quot;acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes.&quot; A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high-starch Eastern diet.

== Medical uses ==

=== Efficacy ===
In type II diabetic patients, acarbose averages an absolute decrease of 0.8 percentage points in HbA1c, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies. Individuals with higher baseline levels show higher reductions, about an 0.12% additional decrease for each point of baseline HbA1c. Its effect on postprandial glucose, but not on HbA1c, scales with dose. Among diabetic patients, acarbose may help reduce the damage done to blood vessels and kidneys by reducing glucose levels.

A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with prediabetes, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). It was found that acarbose reduced the incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose, when compared to diet and exercise, metformin, placebo, or no intervention, improved all-cause mortality, reduced or increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, serious or non-serious adverse events, non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure, or non-fatal myocardial infarction.

Several studies showed that glucosidase inhibitors and alpha-amylase inhibitors promote loss of visceral fat and waist by acting as calorie restriction mimetics (linked to its acarbose-like action).

===Combination therapy===
The combination of acarbose with metformin results in greater reductions of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and post-prandial glucose than either agent alone.

==Adverse effects==
Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon. In the colon, bacteria digest (ferment) the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as flatulence (78% of patients) and diarrhea (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing. Sucrose is more likely to trigger GI side effects compared to starch.

Acarbose is associated with very rare elevated transaminases (19 out of 500,000). Even rarer cases of hepatitis has been reported with acarbose use. It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped. Liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine as a precaution. A 2016 meta-analysis confirms that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, including acarbose, have a statistically significant link to elevated transaminase levels.

== Pharmacology ==
===Mechanism of action===
Acarbose inhibits enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) needed to digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines, and pancreatic alpha-amylase. It locks up the enzymes by mimicking the transition state of the substrate with its amine linkage. However, bacterial alpha-amylases from gut microbiome are able to degrade acarbose.

Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level.

=== Metabolism ===
Acarbose degradation is the unique feature of glycoside hydrolases in gut microbiota, acarbose degrading glucosidase, which hydrolyze acarbose into an acarviosine-glucose and glucose. Human enzymes do transform acarbose: the pancreatic alpha-amylase is able to perform a rearrangement reaction, moving the glucose unit in the &quot;tail&quot; maltose to the &quot;head&quot; of the molecule. Analog drugs with the &quot;tail&quot; glucose removed or flipped to an α(1-6) linkage resist this transformation.

It has been reported that the maltogenic alpha-amylase from &quot;Thermus&quot; sp. IM6501 (ThMA) and a cyclodextrinase (CDase) from &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; could hydrolyse acarbose to glucose and acarviosine-glucose, ThMA can further hydrolyze acarviosine-glucose into acarviosin and glucose. A cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) from gut bacteria &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot; degraded acarbose via two different modes of action to produce maltose and acarviosin, as well as glucose and acarviosine-glucose, suggest that acarbose resistance is caused by the human microbiome. The microbiome-derived acarbose kinases are also specific to phosphorylate and inactivate acarbose. The molecular modeling showed the interaction between gut bacterial acarbose degrading glucosidase and human α-amylase.
==Natural distribution==
In nature, acarbose is synthesized by soil bacteria &quot;Actinoplanes sp&quot; through its precursor valienamine. And acarbose is also degraded by gut bacteria &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot; and soil bacteria &quot;Thermus&quot; sp by acarbose degrading glucosidases.

== In molecular biology ==
Acarbose is described chemically as a pseudotetrasaccharide, specifically a maltotetraose mimic inhibitor. As an inhibitor that mimics some natural substrates, it is useful for elucidating the structure of sugar-digesting enzymes, by binding into the same pocket.

== Research ==
Most studies investigating alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity use acarbose as reference.

In human T2DM patients, acarbose reduces total triglyceride levels. Acarbose has a similar effect in non-T2DM patients with isolated familial hypertriglyceridemia.

In smaller samples of healthy human volunteers, acarbose increases postprandial GLP-1 levels.

In studies conducted by three independent laboratories by the US National Institute on Aging&#x27;s intervention testing programme, acarbose was shown to extend the lifespan of female mice by 5% and of male mice by 22%.

<text>Evelyn Beatrice Hall (28 September 1868 – 13 April 1956), who wrote under the pseudonym S[tephen] G. Tallentyre, was an English writer best known for her biography of Voltaire entitled &quot;The Life of Voltaire&quot;, first published in 1903. She also wrote &quot;The Friends of Voltaire&quot;, which she completed in 1906.

In &quot;The Friends of Voltaire&quot;, Hall wrote: &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot; as an illustration of Voltaire&#x27;s beliefs. This quotation – which is sometimes misattributed to Voltaire himself – is often cited to describe the principle of freedom of speech.

==Personal life==
Hall was born on 28 September 1868 in Shooter&#x27;s Hill, Kent, the second of the four children of the Reverend William John Hall (1830–1910), Minor Canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and Isabella Frances Hall (&quot;née&quot; Cooper). Her elder sister, Ethel Frances Hall (1865–1943), married the writer Hugh Stowell Scott (pseudonym Henry Seton Merriman) in 1889. Evelyn Hall was to become an important influence in the life of her brother-in-law, with whom she co-authored two volumes of short stories, &quot;From Wisdom Court&quot; (1893) and &quot;The Money-Spinner&quot; (1896). Upon his death in 1903, Scott left £5,000 to Hall, writing that it was &quot;in token of my gratitude for her continued assistance and literary advice, without which I should never have been able to have made a living by my pen&quot;.

Hall never married, and died in Wadhurst, East Sussex, on 13 April 1956, aged 87.

<text>Robert Harry Kuykendall, also known as Bobby Dall (born November 2, 1963), is an American musician best known as the bassist for the rock band Poison.

Dall had ambitions of studying law, but ultimately turned to music instead. He began playing guitar but switched to bass at the age of 15. Dall later moved to Los Angeles with Bret Michaels, Rikki Rockett, and Matt Smith to play with the band Paris, which later became known as Poison. 

== Personal life==
Dall is the youngest of three children. He lived in Palm Bay, Florida with his family from the age of 9 to age 17, before relocating to Harrisburg. Dall currently resides in Indialantic, FL. 

Dall has two children: Zachary (born 1990) and Zoe (born 1997).

==Band incident==
During a Poison show in Atlanta on August 25, 2006, Dall and Bret Michaels had to be separated after Michaels threw his mic at Dall, and Dall retaliated by hitting Michaels with his bass guitar, injuring his knee. Michaels apologized and stated &quot;like brothers, sometimes you have to air things out,&quot; the band did finish the set. This altercation was the first onstage incident since a fight between Michaels and C.C. DeVille at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1991. The band took time out while Michaels continued with his solo tour.

<text>Bulelani T. Ngcuka (pronounced ; born 2 May 1954) is a South African attorney, prosecutor and activist, who served as the first Director of Public Prosecutions in South Africa, and is the husband of former Deputy President of South Africa Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.

==Early life and legal career==
Bulelani Ngcuka, one of five siblings, was born in Middledrift, Eastern Cape and schooled in the former Bantustan of Transkei. He obtained his B.Proc at the University of Fort Hare in 1977 and went to work for the Durban law firm of Griffiths Mxenge as an articled clerk in 1978. He finished his articles at GM Mxenge Law Firm in 1981, the same year Mxenge was assassinated by apartheid hit men. He spent eight months in solitary confinement in 1981 and was jailed for three years in 1982 for refusing to give evidence in the political trial of Patrick Maqubele and others. While in prison, he completed his LLB through University of South Africa (Unisa).

When Ngcuka was released in 1985, he left for Switzerland and worked at the equality of human rights branch of International Labour Organization in Geneva for two years. It was here that he married Phumzile Mlambo. They have a son, Luyolo. They also have four adopted children.

On his return to South Africa, Ngcuka joined N.J Yekiso &amp; Associates Law Firm in Cape Town. He set up his own firm, Partner Ngcuka &amp; Martana Law Firm in 1989 but became increasingly involved in politics. He also helped set up the National Association of Democratic Lawyers, an alternative legal association to the established white law societies.

Integrating and moving beyond the Enlightenment concerns of liberalism, Progressive Christianity is a postliberal theological movement that, in the words of Reverend Roger Wolsey, &quot;seeks to reform the faith via the insights of post-modernism and a reclaiming of the truth beyond the verifiable historicity and factuality of the passages in the Bible by affirming the truths within the stories that may not have actually happened.&quot;

Progressive Christianity, as described by its adherents, is characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, a strong emphasis on social justice and care for the poor and the oppressed, and environmental stewardship of the earth. Progressive Christians have a deep belief in the centrality of the instruction to &quot;love one another&quot; (John 15:17) within the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is largely a western, Anglosphere movement, with ecumenical and cross-denominational currents and influences. It is particularly influential in mainline Protestantism, with some influence among liberal and Post-Vatican II Roman Catholicism (especially those influenced by movements such as liberation theology), and American evangelicalism, particularly the emerging Church and exvangelical movements, and the evangelical left.
==History==
===Origins===

The term &quot;progressive Christianity&quot; was first coined by German-American Lutheran pastor and scholar, Rev. John H. W. Stuckenberg. “I favor a progressive Christianity based on the living teachings of Christ and his Apostles. I am opposed to the stagnation created by religious dogmatism and traditionalism, and wish none of my possessions to be used in the interest of this stagnation.” (last will and testament, June 6, 1898) 

A priority of justice and care for the down-trodden are a recurrent theme in the Hebrew prophetic tradition inherited by Christianity. This has been reflected in many later Christian traditions of service and ministry, and more recently in the United States of America through Christian involvement in political trends such as the Progressive Movement and the Social Gospel.

Throughout the 20th century, a strand of progressive or liberal Christian thought outlined the values of a &#x27;good society&#x27;. It stresses fairness, justice, responsibility, and compassion, and condemns the forms of governance that wage unjust war, rely on corruption for continued power, deprive the poor of facilities, or exclude particular racial or sexual groups from fair participation in national liberties. It was influential in the US mainline churches, and reflected global trends in student activism. It contributed to the ecumenical movement, as represented internationally by the World Student Christian Federation and the World Council of Churches internationally, and at the national level through groups such as the National Council of Churches in the US and Australian Student Christian Movement.

===Contemporary movement===

The ascendancy of evangelicalism in the US, particularly in its more socially conservative forms, challenged many people in mainline churches. This has enabled many Christians who are uncomfortable with conservative evangelicalism to identify themselves explicitly as &quot;progressive Christians&quot;.

Notable initiatives within the movement for progressive Christianity include Progressive Christianity (Organization) and Faithful America. The &quot;Sojourners&quot; magazine was founded in 1971 by the Sojourners Community and was the first progressive magazine. In 2007, the Red-Letter Christians movement was founded by Tony Campolo and Shane Claiborne to insist to Jesus&#x27; words by promoting biblical values such as peace, the fight against poverty, the defense of peace, building strong families, respecting human rights and welcoming foreigners.

In the UK, the Progressive Christianity Britain network has adopted eight non-credal points which reflect the nature of a Christian life explored from a progressive standpoint. The network holds group meetings in many locations around the country.

According to Archbishop Wynn Wagner of the former North American Old Catholic Church, holding to the ideals of progressive Christianity sets the movement apart from traditional Christianity. Inclusiveness and acceptance is the basic posture of progressive Christianity.

==Themes and variations==

Progressive Christianity is the post-modern influenced evolution of historic mainline liberal Protestant Christianity and it is an heir to the Social Gospel movement. It draws from process theology, liberation theology, feminist theology, womanist theology, and eco-theology as well. Progressive Christianity focuses on promoting values such as compassion, justice, mercy, and tolerance, often through political activism. Though prominent, the movement is by no means the only significant movement of progressive thought among Christians. It draws influence from multiple theological streams, including evangelicalism, liberal Christianity, neo-orthodoxy, pragmatism, postmodern theology, progressive Christian reconstructionism, and liberation theology. The concerns of feminism are also a major influence on the movement, as expressed in feminist and womanist theologies. Although &quot;progressive Christianity&quot; and &quot;liberal Christianity&quot; are often used synonymously, the two movements are distinct, despite much overlap. While there is some philosophical overlap, progressive Christianity is not synonymous with progressive politics.

The term was first coined by German-American, Lutheran pastor and scholar, Rev. John H. W. Stuckenberg. “I favor a progressive Christianity based on the living teachings of Christ and his Apostles. I am opposed to the stagnation created by religious dogmatism and traditionalism, and wish none of my possessions to be used in the interest of this stagnation.” (last will and testament, June 6, 1898) 
The term was later embraced by retired Episcopal priest Rev. Jim Adams who founded The Center for Progressive Christianity in 1996 - which has since become ProgressiveChristianity.Org. That organization has promoted &quot;The 8 Points of Progressive Christianity&quot;, and has since established the 5 Core Values of Progressive Christianity 
other variations include The Phoenix Confessions. 

As Wolsey describes, &quot;Over the past decades, there has been a growing movement to reclaim Christianity from those who&#x27;ve distorted it into something that Jesus [progressive Christians contend] and his earliest followers wouldn&#x27;t easily recognize -- conservative evangelicalism and fundamentalism. The movement has emerged on two fronts, roughly simultaneously. One wing comes from the mainline Protestant and Catholic Churches that, due to the shift from modern era mindsets into postmodern ones, have shifted from liberal theology to &quot;progressive&quot; Christianity. The other wing comes from young people within the Evangelical communities who are questioning and redefining their tradition and is known as &quot;emergent&quot; Christianity. Combined, these movements are a new Reformation. The &quot;ex-&quot;evangelicals from the emerging Christianity have recently come to refer to themselves a progressive Christians so the moniker has become a universal umbrella term.&quot;

The following is the working definition used in Roger Wolsey’s book “Kissing Fish”: 
&quot;Progressive Christianity is a post-liberal approach to the Christian faith that is influenced by postmodernism and: proclaims Jesus of Nazareth as Christ; emphasizes the Way and teachings of Jesus, not merely His person; emphasizes God’s immanence not merely God’s transcendence; leans toward panentheism rather than supernatural theism; emphasizes salvation here and now instead of primarily in heaven later; emphasizes being saved for robust, abundant/eternal life over being saved from hell; emphasizes the social/communal aspects of salvation instead of merely the personal; stresses social justice, environmental protection, and non-violence as integral to Christian discipleship; takes the Bible seriously but not necessarily literally, embracing a more interpretive, metaphorical understanding; emphasizes orthopraxy instead of orthodoxy (right actions over right beliefs); embraces reason as well as paradox and mystery — instead of blind allegiance to rigid doctrines and dogmas; does not consider homosexuality to be sinful; and does not claim that Christianity is the only valid or viable way to connect to God (is non-exclusive).&quot; p.63-64

===Seventh-day Adventism===

Within the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the liberal wing describe themselves as &quot;progressive Adventists&quot;. They disagree with some of the traditional teachings of the church. While most are still of evangelical persuasion, a minority are liberal Christians.

===Environmental ministries===
Central to this recovery of awe in the cosmos is the epic of evolution, the 14-billion-year history of the universe. Scientists (Edward O. Wilson, Brian Swimme, Eric Chaisson, Ursula Goodenough and others) initiated this story which has been perpetuated with a religion component by some liberal theologians (Gordon D. Kaufman, Jerome A. Stone, Michael Dowd, etc.).

Evolutionary evangelist and progressive minister Michael Dowd uses the term Epic of Evolution or Great Story to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology. His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive (a form of religious naturalism). He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe and a new approach to religion. Evolution is viewed as a religious spiritual process that is not meaningless blind chance.

==Criticism==
Geoff Thompson argues that progressive Christianity, as represented by Gretta Vosper and John Shelby Spong, &quot;often over-reaches its arguments&quot;. In particular, he concludes that &quot;[i]t is very difficult to see how what [Vosper] proposes needs any church or even the minimalist, idiosyncratic definition of Christianity which she offers&quot;.

<text>Livadiya (; ; ; ) is an urban-type settlement in Crimea. It is located west of Yalta. Population: 

==History==
A minor Crimean Tatar settlement in the Middle Ages, Livadiya was named thus by Lambros Katsonis, a Greek revolutionary and Imperial Russian Army officer, after Livadeia, Greece, the town he was born in, then part of the Ottoman Empire. Katsonis had been granted an estate there by Empress Catherine II, which he named thus.

=== Summer residence of the Romanov (1861 - 1917) ===

The estate later passed to the possession of the Potocki family and then, in 1861, it became a summer residence of the Russian tsars. Emperor Alexander III of Russia died there in 1894.

The Livadia Palace, built in 1910–11, architect Nikolai Krasnov, is now a museum. It was formerly a summer palace of the last Russian Imperial family.

One of the most important events held in this town by the Romanov dynasty was the &quot;White Flower Day&quot; charity event that took place mainly in this little town from 1911 to 1917, that aimed at gathering donations to support people having tubercolosis. The event was particularly loved by the empress Alexandra Fyodorovna.

=== Later use ===
In 1945, it served as the meeting place of the Yalta Conference and residence of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Conference. Nowadays, Livadiia is known primarily for producing wine and is also a noted health resort.

==Namesakes==
A minor planet 3006 Livadia discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979 is named after the suburb.

<text>The Eucumbene River, a perennial river of the Snowy River catchment, is located in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
The Eucumbene River rises below Shaw Hill, in the northern part of the Kosciuszko National Park, approximately north of the village of Kiandra. The river flows generally south and southeast before emptying into Lake Eucumbene where its flow is impounded by Eucumbene Dam. After passing through or over the dam wall, the river flows generally south before emptying into Lake Jindabyne, impounded by Jindabyne Dam. Within Lake Jindabyne, the river reaches its confluence with the Snowy River.

The river descends over its course, joined by seven minor tributaries.

The flow of the river is impacted by alpine conditions, with high flows during spring as a result of snow melt. During winter, the river is subject to snow and ice conditions.

The Snowy Mountains Highway crosses the river at several locations between Adaminaby and Kiandra.

<doc id="1128891" wikidata="Q1442975" url="?curid=1128891" title="Frank Bolle">
<text>Frank W. Bolle (June 23, 1924 – May 12, 2020) was an American comic-strip artist, comic book artist and illustrator, best known as the longtime artist of the newspaper strips &quot;Winnie Winkle&quot; and &quot;The Heart of Juliet Jones&quot;; for stints on the comic books &quot;Tim Holt&quot; and &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot;; and as an illustrator for the Boy Scouts of America magazine &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; for 18 years. With an unknown writer, he co-created the masked, Old West comic-book heroine the Black Phantom. Bolle sometimes used the pen name FWB and, at least once, F. L. Blake.

==Early life==
Frank Bolle was born in Italy and immigrated to the United States at age 5 to join his mother in Brooklyn, New York, although Bolle in adulthood said he was born in Brooklyn. He grew up in that borough with mother Mary and stepfather Egidio &quot;Louie&quot; Covacich. Bolle attended Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Music &amp; Art, though one standard reference source, attributing its information to Bolle via an intermediary, lists the School of Industrial Art high school. From 1943 to 1946, Bolle served in the United States Army Air Force, and after his return from World War II attended Pratt Institute on the G.I. Bill, graduating in three years.

==Career==
===1940s and 1950s===
Bolle broke into comics in 1943, drawing backgrounds for Funnies Inc., one of a handful of &quot;packagers&quot; that supplied content to publishers entering the fledgling medium of comic books. His first known credits are penciling and inking two &quot;Terry Vance&quot; detective features for Timely Comics, the precursor of Marvel Comics, in &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #47–48 (cover-dated Sept.-Oct. 1943). He served in World War II, and it is unclear if the small number of Bolle stories that appear in comics from U.S. Camera, Rural Home, and Green Publishing through 1946 were done during the war or were inventory from before his service. His comics output became regular soon afterward with a &quot;Freddy Freshman&quot; story in Fawcett Comics&#x27; &quot;Captain Marvel Jr.&quot; #46 (Feb. 1947) and work in &quot;Crown Comics&quot; from the publisher McCombs from 1947 to 1948. He did additional work for Fawcett, and signed some of his Lev Gleason Publications comics work FWB.

Bolle himself, in an undated interview, conducted no earlier than 1992, did not mention his prewar work when asked about &quot;the first comic book you worked on&quot;:
With an unknown writer, Bolle co-created the masked Old West heroine the Black Phantom in Magazine Enterprises&#x27; Western comic &quot;Tim Holt&quot; #25 (Sept. 1951). Through 1954, he also drew the title feature as well as the backup feature &quot;Redmask&quot;, then took over the art for the spinoff series &quot;Red Mask&quot;, drawing issues #42–53 to (July 1954 – May 1956). Additionally, for DC Comics, Bolle drew the cyborg-superhero feature &quot;Robotman&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #167–179 (Jan. 1951 – Jan. 1952).

From 1955 to 1957, Bolle drew Robin Hood stories in ME&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and the subsequent, TV series-based &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. For Marvel Comics&#x27; 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics, he drew supernatural fantasy stories in the anthologies &quot;Mystic&quot;, &quot;Marvel Tales&quot;, &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; and other titles in 1956 and 1957. As well by the mid-1950s, Bolle was illustrating juvenile fiction books, including &quot;Gene Autry &amp; Champion&quot; (1956), and books starring Lassie and the Lone Ranger. He would later draw for the Choose Your Own Adventure children&#x27;s book series.

From 1957 to 1961, Bolle began his long career in newspaper comic strips, starting as an art assistant, drawing backgrounds, on the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate&#x27;s daily and Sunday &quot;On Stage&quot; from 1957 to 1961.

===1960s===
This briefly overlapped his own Sunday comic strip, the McNaught Syndicate&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Tales&quot;, which he wrote and drew from 1960 to 1969. He recalled it as &quot;a Sunday page where I illustrated some classics like &#x27;Cinderella&#x27; and &#x27;Rumplestilskin&#x27; and I did them in three parts so they would appear on three Sundays. And in-between that I would also write original stories, so I wrote about 12 to 15 original stories, then I would switch back and forth from classics to originals.&quot; For the same syndicate, he drew the daily and Sunday strip &quot;Debbie Deere&quot;, &quot;a lonely hearts writer [who] would get involved in some of the letters she got. I did that for about 4 years,&quot; from 1966 to 1969. For the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate, he wrote and drew the strip &quot;Quick Quiz&quot; from 1964 to 1965. By this time he was also illustrating for magazines, beginning with the men&#x27;s adventure title &quot;Stag&quot; from 1961 to 1962.

He used the pseudonym F. L. Blake for the dust jacket of the 1963 book &quot;Picture Parade of Jewish History&quot;. Keeping a hand in comic books, Bolle drew the superhero series &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; #6–19 (Nov. 1963 – April 1967) for Western Publishing&#x27;s Gold Key Comics imprint, and did a small amount of work for DC Comics, Dell Comics, and Tower Comics.

In 1966, Bolle began a long association with the magazine &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, drawing numerous comic strips for the glossy monthly publication of the Boy Scouts of America. Through 1981, he drew at different times the strips &quot;Bible Stories&quot;, &quot;Green Bar Bill&quot;, &quot;Pedro Patrol&quot;, &quot;Pee Wee Harris&quot;, &quot;Pool of Fire&quot;, &quot;Scouts in America&quot;, &quot;Space Adventures&quot;, &quot;The Tracy Twins&quot; and &quot;White Mountains&quot;. He did other art as well for the magazine, from 1977 to 1984, and drew an adaptation of John Christopher&#x27;s &quot;The Tripods&quot; as well as an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Between Planets.&quot;

From 1965 to 1975, Bolle drew covers for nonfiction paperback books including &quot;Baton Twirling&quot;, &quot;Invitation to Skin and Scuba Diving&quot;, &quot;Scuba, Spear &amp; Snorkel&quot;, &quot;Soccer&quot;, and &quot;Boxing&quot;.

===1970s–2000s===
Two stories he penciled and inked, and one that he inked over penciler Russ Jones, from the paperback anthology &quot;Christopher Lee&#x27;s Treasury of Terror&quot; (Pyramid Books, 1966), were reprinted in three 1968 issues of Warren Publications&#x27; black-and-white horror comics magazine &quot;Eerie&quot;. Bolle went on to draw new stories published in that magazine and in its sister publication &quot;Vampirella&quot; in 1970 and 1971, and in 1973 inked roughly a dozen stories for Marvel Comics, including in issues of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot;, &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; and &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;. Throughout the 1970s he also continued to do work for longtime clients Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics (in &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and other titles, including a short return to &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot;). Additionally, sometimes under his FWB pseudonym, he also contributed to Charlton Comics.

His comic-strip work in the 1970s included drawing the daily and Sunday &quot;Alexander Gates&quot; (1970–1971); the title character, Bolle said, &quot;was an astrologist, I did that for a couple of years&quot;, For
Universal Press Syndicate, he drew the trip &quot;Best Seller Showcase&quot; daily (1977) and Sunday (1977–1978), which included &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, based on the Clive Cussler novel; for the same syndicate, he drew &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; daily and Sunday (1978–1980). He was the uncredited ghost artist on the daily &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; for King Features Syndicate from 1977 to 1994, and, for one month in 1982, the Sunday &quot;Tarzan&quot; for United Feature Syndicate. In an undated interview conducted no earlier than 1992, he said, &quot;Today, I work on the &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; strip — I do some of them. It&#x27;s funny — I grew up reading, admiring and copying &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; and today I&#x27;m the one penciling them!&quot;

Bolle&#x27;s last known mainstream penciling and inking for comic books is the cover of Gold Key Comics&#x27; &quot;Shroud of Mystery&quot; #1 (June 1982). He later drew a page for the one-shot benefit comic &quot;Strip AIDS U.S.A.&quot; (1988) from Last Gasp. He returned to ink the last 31 pages of a 42-page story in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; vol. 2, #1 (Nov. 1989), over penciler Mark Bright.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bolle drew and lettered the Sunday and daily Tribune Media Services strip &quot;Winnie Winkle&quot;, either from 1982–1996 or, he has said, &quot;for 20 years&quot;. He performed those same functions on King Features&#x27; &quot;The Heart of Juliet Jones&quot; from 1989–2000, either for both dailies and Sundays or &quot;just dailies&quot;. He lettered Tribune&#x27;s venerable &quot;Annie&quot; daily and Sunday strips in the 1980s through 1999, contributing, as well, a small amount of art as a ghost artist. Finally, he did ghost art on Tribune Media&#x27;s &quot;Gil Thorp&quot; in 1995, 1996 and 2008. Credited, he drew the daily and Sunday North America Syndicate strip &quot;Apartment 3-G&quot; in 1999. He continued with the strip through its finale in November 2015, by which point Bolle was 91.

From 1996 through at least 2009, Bolle did pet illustrations for the Westport Pet Company, as well as commissioned pet portraits, including one that was scheduled to appear in the Walt Disney Pictures movie &quot;Old Dogs&quot;. He illustrated the 2008 children&#x27;s book &quot;My Cat Merigold&quot; by Angelica Joy.

As late as 2004, he was a guest and panelist at San Diego Comic-Con.

==Awards==
Bolle was one of 10 recipients of the 2003 Inkpot Award.

==Personal life==
As an adult, Bolle lived in Weston, Connecticut, with his wife, Lori. He had two children, daughter Laura and son Frank.

Bolle died May 12, 2020, at the age of 95 and was interred at Willowbrook Cemetery in Westport, Connecticut.

<text>The Riuwaka River, formerly known as the Riwaka River, is located in the Nelson region in the northwest of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It flows for 20 kilometres, entering Tasman Bay close to the town of Riwaka, 10 kilometres north of Motueka.

The valleys of the Riuwaka and nearby Tākaka River form part of the pass over which the only road between Tasman Bay and Golden Bay runs.

For part of its journey, the river flows underground through limestone caves, returning to the open air at &quot;The Riuwaka Resurgence&quot;. This spot is popular with both holidaymakers and divers, as the water is always crystal clear, and is very cold even in the heat of mid-summer.

The name of the river was officially altered to Riuwaka River in August 2014, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlements between the Crown and local iwi Ngāti Rārua and Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui.

<doc id="1128895" wikidata="Q918753" url="?curid=1128895" title="British Approved Name">
<text>A British Approved Name (BAN) is the official, non-proprietary, or generic name given to a pharmaceutical substance, as defined in the British Pharmacopoeia (BP). The BAN is also the official name used in some countries around the world, because starting in 1953, proposed new names were evaluated by a panel of experts from WHO in conjunction with the BP commission to ensure naming consistency worldwide (an effort leading to the International Nonproprietary Name system). There is also a British Approved Name (Modified) (BANM).

==Combination preparations==
BANs are unique in that names are assigned for combination preparations as well as single-drug preparations. For example, the BAN co-amoxiclav is assigned to preparations containing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Most other pharmacopoeias simply refer to combination products by both ingredients in the preparation, in this example &quot;amoxicillin with clavulanic acid&quot;.

The prefix of &quot;co-&quot; is used for many combination drugs, including opioid with paracetamol or aspirin analgesics (e.g., co-codamol, co-codaprin, co-dydramol, co-proxamol); the anti-diarrhoeal, non-analgesic mixture of diphenoxylate and atropine, co-phenotrope (trade name Lomotil); antibiotics (e.g., co-fluampicil and co-trimoxazole); antihypertensives (e.g., co-tenidone); diuretics (e.g., co-amilofruse and co-amilozide); gastrointestinal drugs (e.g., co-danthrusate); and anti-Parkinsonism agents such as co-careldopa, co-beneldopa, and co-cyprindiol.

==BAN harmonisation==
European Union legislation from 2001 required harmonisation of the BP with the European Pharmacopoeia (EP), as well as the adoption of International Nonproprietary Names through directives (2001/82/EC and 2001/83/EC, as amended, and 2003/63/EC). Across the EU has meant that, with the notable exception of adrenaline/epinephrine, BANs are now the same as the INNs. For example, the old BAN &quot;methicillin&quot; was replaced with the current BAN &quot;meticillin&quot;, matching the INN.

This has resulted in an interesting situation in other countries that use BANs. While the British Pharmacopoeia and BANs are the official pharmacopoeia/names defined by legislation in many of these countries, the former BANs often continue to be used, purportedly because of the difficulty of changeover. Despite the importance of the BP, there appears to be little or no movement in the direction of changing these names. In Australia, the Australian Approved Names are generally the same as BANs, but a few exceptions remain.

<doc id="1128897" wikidata="Q7252749" url="?curid=1128897" title="Provisional ballot">
<text>In elections in the United States, a provisional ballot (called an affidavit ballot in New York) is used to record a vote when there are questions about a given voter&#x27;s eligibility that must be resolved before the vote can count. The federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 guarantees that, in most states, the voter can cast a provisional ballot if the voter states that they are entitled to vote.

Some of the most common reasons to cast a provisional ballot include:

*The voter&#x27;s name does not appear on the electoral roll for the given precinct (polling place), because the voter is not registered to vote or is registered to vote elsewhere
*The voter&#x27;s eligibility cannot be established or has been challenged
*The voter lacks a photo identification document (in jurisdictions that require one)
*The voter requested to vote by absentee ballot but claims to have not received, or not cast, the absentee ballot
*The voter&#x27;s registration contains inaccurate or outdated information such as the wrong address or a misspelled name
*In a closed primary (limited to members of a political party), the voter&#x27;s party registration is listed incorrectly

Whether a provisional ballot is counted is contingent upon the verification of that voter&#x27;s eligibility, which may involve local election officials reviewing government records or asking the voter for more information, such as a photo identification not presented at the polling place or proof of residence. Each state may set its own timing rules for when these issues must be resolved. Provisional ballots therefore cannot usually be counted until after the day of the election.

==History==
The right of political parties to have observers at polling places is long-standing. One of the established roles for such observers is to act as challengers, in the event that someone attempts to vote at the polling place who is not eligible to vote.

Before the implementation of provisional ballots, some state laws allowed a voter whose eligibility was challenged to cast a &quot;challenged ballot&quot;. After the polls closed, the canvassing board was then charged with examining the challenged ballots and determining whether the challenge was to be upheld or not.

The Help America Vote Act brings a degree of uniformity to the array of various challenged ballot rules enacted by various states. For example, each state must provide a means for the voter to find out whether his or her ballot was counted, though the states may use different ways of doing so (such as a website or a phone number).

Though the Act mandates the use of provisional ballots nationwide, it exempted the six states that had been exempted from the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 because those states had and continue to have either &quot;same-day&quot; voter registration or no registration requirement at all: Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. However, those states may choose to use provisional ballots. , North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming used them for some purposes, while the other three did not have provisional ballots at all.

==Potential problems==

During the 2018 midterm elections, approximately 20 out of 205 provisional ballots cast in Broward County (a subset of the over 600 provisional ballots and 1.1 million total ballots cast in Broward) were rejected under signature matching requirements. After this determination, both valid and invalid provisional ballots—without enclosing envelopes—were mixed together, which provided no way for them to be separated for the recount.

Computer scientist and election official Douglas W. Jones has criticized the offer of a provisional ballot as &quot;a way to brush off troublesome voters by letting them think they have voted.&quot; He expressed the concern that, under some states&#x27; laws, casting a provisional ballot at the wrong precinct would disenfranchise voters who could have cast valid ballots had they been redirected to the proper precinct.

Academic research has suggested that provisional ballots tend to lean more toward the Democratic Party than the electorate as a whole, and that this contributes to a phenomenon, first identified by Edward Foley known as &quot;blue shift,&quot; under which Democrats increase their share of the vote as more ballots are counted. This can potentially result in a different outcome from the one indicated by the initial count on the night of the election. Some experts on voting have suggested that this shift could be misunderstood and lead to erroneous claims of electoral fraud or corruption.

==Rates of acceptance==

According to the Election Assistance Commission thousands of provisional ballots are not counted each election.

The 2004 US Presidential Election was the first presidential election conducted under the Help America Vote Act&#x27;s provisions. Nationwide, at least 1.9 million provisional ballots were cast, and 676,000 were never counted due to various states&#x27; rules on counting provisional ballots.

Studies of the use of provisional ballots in the 2006 general election in the United States show that around 21% of provisional ballots were rejected. About 44% of these were cast by voters who were not registered, but many other rejections were for reasons that were &quot;preventable,&quot; such as an incorrect precinct or missing signature.

The rates of rejection vary widely across the states, with some states counting all or nearly all provisional ballots while others reject more than half.

<text>End plate potentials (EPPs) are the voltages which cause depolarization of skeletal muscle fibers caused by neurotransmitters binding to the postsynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction. They are called &quot;end plates&quot; because the postsynaptic terminals of muscle fibers have a large, saucer-like appearance. When an action potential reaches the axon terminal of a motor neuron, vesicles carrying neurotransmitters (mostly acetylcholine) are exocytosed and the contents are released into the neuromuscular junction. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and lead to its depolarization. In the absence of an action potential, acetylcholine vesicles spontaneously leak into the neuromuscular junction and cause very small depolarizations in the postsynaptic membrane. This small response (~0.4mV) is called a miniature end plate potential (MEPP) and is generated by one acetylcholine-containing vesicle. It represents the smallest possible depolarization which can be induced in a muscle.

== Neuromuscular junction ==
The neuromuscular junction is the synapse that is formed between an alpha motor neuron (α-MN) and the skeletal muscle fiber. In order for a muscle to contract, an action potential is first propagated down a nerve until it reaches the axon terminal of the motor neuron. The motor neuron then innervates the muscle fibers to contraction by causing an action potential on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.

===Acetylcholine===
End plate potentials are produced almost entirely by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine is the second most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the body following glutamate. It controls the somatosensory system which includes the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. It was the first neurotransmitter to be identified in 1914 by Henry Dale. Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the neuron from choline and acetyl-CoA. Choline acetyltransferase is the enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine and is often used as a marker in research relating to acetylcholine production. Neurons that utilize acetylcholine are called cholinergic neurons and they are very important in muscle contraction, memory, and learning.

=== Ion channels===
The polarization of membranes is controlled by sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ion channels. There are two types of ion channels involved in the neuromuscular junction and end plate potentials: voltage-gated ion channel and ligand-gated ion channel. Voltage gated ion channels are responsive to changes in membrane voltage which cause the voltage gated ion channel to open and allows certain ions to pass through. Ligand gated ion channels are responsive to certain molecules such as neurotransmitters. The binding of a ligand to the receptor on the ion channel protein causes a conformational change which allows the passing of certain ions.

=== Presynaptic membrane ===
Normally the resting membrane potential of a motor neuron is kept at -70mV to -50 with a higher concentration of sodium outside and a higher concentration of potassium inside. When an action potential propagates down a nerve and reaches the axon terminal of the motor neuron, the change in membrane voltage causes the calcium voltage gated ion channels to open allowing for an influx of calcium ions. These calcium ions cause the acetylcholine vesicles attached to the presynaptic membrane to release acetylcholine via exocytosis into the synaptic cleft.

=== Postsynaptic membrane ===
EPP are caused mostly by the binding of acetylcholine to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. There are two different kinds of acetylcholine receptors: nicotinic and muscarinic. Nicotinic receptors are ligand gated ion channels for fast transmission. All acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction are nicotinic. Muscarinic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that use a second messenger. These receptors are slow and therefore are unable to measure a miniature end plate potential (MEPP). They are located in the parasympathetic nervous system such as in the vagus nerve and the gastrointestinal tract. 
During fetal development acetylcholine receptors are concentrated on the postsynaptic membrane and the entire surface of the nerve terminal in the growing embryo is covered even before a signal is fired. Five subunits consisting of four different proteins from four different genes comprise the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors therefore their packaging and assembly is a very complicated process with many different factors. The enzyme muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) initiates signaling processes in the developing postsynaptic muscle cell. It stabilizes the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor clusters, facilitates the transcription of synaptic genes by muscle fiber nuclei, and triggers differentiation of the axon growth cone to form a differentiated nerve terminal. Substrate laminin induces advanced maturation of the acetylcholine receptor clusters on the surfaces of myotubes.

== Initiation==

===Synaptic vesicles===
All neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis from synaptic vesicles. Two kinds of neurotransmitter vesicles exist: large dense core vesicles and small clear core vesicles. Large dense core vesicles contain neuropeptides and large neurotransmitters that are created in the cell body of the neuron and then transported via fast axonal transport down to the axon terminal. Small clear core vesicles transport small molecule neurotransmitters that are synthesized locally in the presynaptic terminals. Finalized neurotransmitter vesicles are bound to the presynaptic membrane. When an action potential propagates down the motor neuron axon and arrives at the axon terminal, it causes a depolarization of the axon terminal and opens calcium channels. This causes the release of the neurotransmitters via vesicle exocytosis.

After exocytosis, vesicles are recycled during a process known as the synaptic vesicle cycle. The retrieved vesicular membranes are passed through several intracellular compartments where they are modified to make new synaptic vesicles. They are then stored in a reserve pool until they are needed again for transport and release of neurotransmitters.

Unlike the reserve pool, the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles is ready to be activated. Vesicle depletion from the readily releasable pool occurs during high frequency stimulation of long duration and the size of the evoked EPP reduces. This neuromuscular depression is due to less neurotransmitter release during stimulation. In order for depletion not to occur, there must be a balance between repletion and depletion which can happen at low stimulation frequencies of less than 30 Hz.

When a vesicle releases its neurotransmitters via exocytosis, it empties its entire contents into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter release from vesicles is therefore stated to be quantal because only whole numbers of vesicles can be released. In 1970, Bernard Katz from the University of London won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for statistically determining the quantal size of acetylcholine vesicles based on noise analysis in the neuromuscular junction. Using a book on mechanical statistics, he was able to infer the size of individual events going on at the same time.

The synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine are clear core synaptic vesicles with a diameter of 30 nm. Each acetylcholine vesicle contains approximately 5000 acetylcholine molecules. The vesicles release their entire quantity of acetylcholine and this causes miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs) to occur which are less than 1mV in amplitude and not enough to reach threshold.

===Miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs)===
Miniature end plate potentials are the small (~0.4mV) depolarizations of the postsynaptic terminal caused by the release of a single vesicle into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter vesicles containing acetylcholine collide spontaneously with the nerve terminal and release acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction even without a signal from the axon. These small depolarizations are not enough to reach threshold and so an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane does not occur.
During experimentation with MEPPs, it was noticed that often spontaneous action potentials would occur, called end plate spikes in normal striated muscle without any stimulus. It was believed that these end plate spikes occurred as a result of injury or irritation of the muscles fibers due to the electrodes. Recent experiments have shown that these end plate spikes are actually caused by muscle spindles and have two distinct patterns: small and large. Small end plate spikes have a negative onset without signal propagation and large end plate spikes resemble motor unit potentials (MUPs). Muscle spindles are sensory receptors that measure muscle elongation or stretch and relay the information to the spinal cord or brain for the appropriate response.

===Threshold potential (&quot;All or None&quot;) ===
When an action potential causes the release of many acetylcholine vesicles, acetylcholine diffuses across the neuromuscular junction and binds to ligand-gated nicotinic receptors (non-selective cation channels) on the muscle fiber. This allows for increased flow of sodium and potassium ions, causing depolarization of the sarcolemma (muscle cell membrane). 
The small depolarization associated with the release of acetylcholine from an individual synaptic vesicle is called a miniature end-plate potential (MEPP), and has a magnitude of about +0.4mV. MEPPs are additive, eventually increasing the end-plate potential (EPPs) from about -100mV up to the threshold potential of -60mV, at which level the voltage-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane open, allowing a sudden flow of sodium ions from the synapse and a sharp spike in depolarization. This depolarization voltage spike triggers an action potential which propagates down the postsynaptic membrane leading to muscle contraction. It is important to note that EPPs are not action potentials, but that they trigger action potentials.
In a normal muscular contraction, approximately 100-200 acetylcholine vesicles are released causing a depolarization that is 100 times greater in magnitude than a MEPP. This causes the membrane potential to depolarize +40mV (100 x 0.4mV = 40mV) from -100mV to -60mV where it reaches threshold.

==Action potential phases==
Once the membrane potential reaches threshold, an action potential occurs and causes a sharp spike in membrane polarity. There are five phases of an action potential: threshold, depolarization, peak, repolarization, and hyperpolarization.

Threshold is when the summation of MEPPs reaches a certain potential and induces the opening of the voltage-gated ion channels. The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane potential to reach a positive charge. The potassium ion channels are slower-acting than the sodium ion channels and so as the membrane potential starts to peak, the potassium ion channels open and causes an outflux of potassium to counteract the influx of sodium. At the peak, the outflux of potassium equals the influx of sodium, and the membrane does not change polarity.

During repolarization, the sodium channels begin to become inactivated, causing a net efflux of potassium ions. This causes the membrane potential to drop down to its resting membrane potential of -100mV. Hyperpolarization occurs because the slow-acting potassium channels take longer to deactivate, so the membrane overshoots the resting potential. It gradually returns to resting potential and is ready for another action potential to occur.

During the action potential before the hyperpolarization phase, the membrane is unresponsive to any stimulation. This inability to induce another action potential is known as the absolute refractory period. During the hyperpolarization period, the membrane is again responsive to stimulations but it requires a much higher input to induce an action potential. This phase is known as the relative refractory period.

Once the action potential has finished in the neuromuscular junction, the used acetylcholine is cleared out of the synaptic cleft by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Several diseases and problems can be caused by the inability of enzymes to clear away the neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft leading to continued action potential propagation.

==Clinical applications ==

Current research is attempting to learn more about end plate potentials and their effect on muscle activity. Many current diseases involve disrupted end plate potential activity. In Alzheimer patients, beta amyloid attaches to the acetylcholine receptors and inhibits acetylcholine binding. This causes less signal propagation and small EPPs that do not reach threshold. By analyzing brain processes with acetylcholine, doctors can measure how much beta amyloid is around and use it to judge its effects on Alzheimer&#x27;s.
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, where the body produces antibodies targeted against the acetylcholine receptor on the postsynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction. Muscle fatigue and weakness, worsened with use and improved by rest, is the hallmark of the disease. Because of the limited amount of acetylcholine receptors that are available for binding, symptomatic treatment consists of using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to reduce the breakdown of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, so that enough acetylcholine will be present for the small number of unblocked receptors.
A congenital abnormality caused by a deficiency in end-plate acetylcholine esterase (AChE) might be a pathophysiologic mechanism for myasthenic gravis. In a study on a patient with AChE deficiency, doctors noted that he had developed severe proximal and truncal muscle weakness with jittering in other muscles. It was found that a combination of the jitter and blocking rate of the acetylcholine receptors caused a reduced end-plate potential similar to what is seen in cases of myasthenia gravis.
Research of motor unit potentials (MUPs) has led to possible clinical applications in the evaluation of the progression of pathological diseases to myogenic or neurogenic origins by measuring the irregularity constant related. Motor unit potentials are the electrical signals produced by motor units that can be characterized by amplitude, duration, phase, and peak, and the irregularity coefficient (IR) is calculated based on the peak numbers and amplitudes.
Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a disorder where presynaptic calcium channels are subjected to autoimmune destruction which causes fewer neurotransmitter vesicles to be exocytosed. This causes smaller EPPs due to less vesicles being released. Often the smaller EPPs do not reach threshold which causes muscle weakness and fatigue in patients. 
Many animals use neurotoxins to defend themselves and kill prey. Tetrodotoxin is a poison found in the certain poisonous fishes such as pufferfish and triggerfish which blocks the sodium ion channels and prevents an action potential on the postsynaptic membrane. Tetraethylammonium found in insects blocks potassium channels. Alpha neurotoxin found in snakes binds to acetylcholine receptors and prevents acetylcholine from binding. Alpha-latrotoxin found in black widow spiders causes a massive influx of calcium at the axon terminal and leads to an overflow of neurotransmitter release.
Botulinum toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum is the most powerful toxic protein. It prevents release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting docking of the neurotransmitter vesicles.

<doc id="1128907" wikidata="Q4926095" url="?curid=1128907" title="United States Adopted Name">
<text>A United States Adopted Name (USAN) is a unique nonproprietary name assigned to a medication marketed in the United States. Each name is assigned by the USAN Council, which is co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA).

The USAN Program states that its goal is to select simple, informative, and unique nonproprietary names (also called generic names) for drugs by establishing logical nomenclature classifications based on pharmacological or chemical relationships. In addition to drugs, the USAN Council names agents for gene therapy and cell therapy, contact lens polymers, surgical materials, diagnostics, carriers, and substances used as an excipient. The USAN Council works in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO) international nonproprietary name (INN) Expert Committee and national nomenclature groups to standardize drug nomenclature and establish rules governing the classification of new substances.

== History ==

The USAN Council began in June 1961 after the AMA and the USP jointly formed the AMA-USP Nomenclature Committee. The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) became the third sponsoring organization in 1964, at which point the name of the committee was changed to the USAN Council, and United States Adopted Name became the official term to describe any nonproprietary name negotiated and formally adopted by the Council. In 1967, a liaison representative from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was appointed to serve on the USAN Council. The FDA announced in 1984 that it would discontinue adding drug names to its official list and use the USAN as the established name for labeling and advertising new single-entity drugs marketed in the United States. The AMA Council on Drugs no longer exists as a separate entity. The FDA now has a representative on the USAN Council, which has moved away from chemically derived names.

Currently, the USAN Council has five members, one from each sponsoring organization, one from the FDA, and a member-at-large. One member is nominated to the USAN Council annually by each sponsoring organization; the FDA nominates one liaison member annually. The member-at-large is selected by the sponsoring organizations from a list of candidates proposed by the AMA, APhA, and the USP. The five nominees to the Council must be approved annually by the board of trustees of the three sponsoring organizations.

===USAN Council members===

*Gerry McEvoy, Pharm.D. (Member-at-Large)
*Thomas P. Reinders
*David Lewis
*Peter Rheinstein, Chair (since 2012)
*Armen Melikian

== Use ==

By definition, nonproprietary names are not subject to proprietary trademark rights but are entirely in the public domain. This distinguishes them from the trademarked names that have been registered for private use.

== Name assignment ==

Assignment of a USAN takes into account practical considerations, such as the existence of trademarks, international harmonization of drug nomenclature, the development of new classes of drugs, and the fact that the intended uses of substances for which names are being selected may change.

USANs assigned today reflect both present nomenclature practices and older methods used to name drug entities. Early drug nomenclature was based on the chemical structure. As newer drugs became chemically more complex and numerous, nonproprietary names based on chemistry became long and difficult to spell, pronounce, or remember. Additionally, chemically derived names provided little useful information to non-chemist health practitioners. Considering the needs of health professionals led to a system in which USANs reflect relationships between new entities and older drugs, and avoid names that might suggest non-existent relationships.

Current nomenclature practices involve the adoption of standardized syllables called &quot;stems&quot; that relate new chemical entities to existing drug families. Stems may be prefixes, suffixes, or interfixes in the nonproprietary name. Each stem can emphasize a specific chemical structure type, a pharmacologic property, or a combination of these attributes. The recommended list of USAN stems is updated regularly to keep pace to accommodate drugs with new chemical and pharmacologic properties.

As a general rule, the application for a USAN should be forwarded to the USAN Council after the Investigational New Drug (IND) is active and clinical trials have begun.

Many drug manufacturers seeking a USAN are multinational companies with subsidiaries in various parts of the world or contractual agreements with drug firms outside the United States. Therefore, it is highly desirable to the pharmaceutical company, the various nomenclature committees, and the medical community in general that a global name be established for each new single-entity compound introduced. Assigning a USAN and standardizing names internationally can take anywhere from several months to a few years.

<doc id="1128916" wikidata="Q871383" url="?curid=1128916" title="Rankweil">
<text>Rankweil is a town in the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg, in the district Feldkirch. It is the second largest town in the district Feldkirch and the eighth largest town in Vorarlberg.

==Geography==
Rankweil is located in the southern Rhine Valley. Its largest river is the Frutz, from which the &quot;Mühlbach&quot; was channeled off through the town for utilization by ten hydroelectric plants.

The two precincts of Rankweil are Brederis and Rankweil. The town adjoins Koblach, Röthis, Sulz, Zwischenwasser, Laterns, Übersaxen, Satteins, Göfis, Feldkirch and Meiningen.

==History==
At the time of the Roman Empire, today&#x27;s Rankweil was known as &quot;Vinomna&quot;. Vinomna was a transport hub where stone-paved Roman roads converged, including the main road from Chur to Augsburg. Rankweil itself was first mentioned in 842.

In 1375 the Counts of Montfort sold the dominion of Feldkirch, including Rankweil, to the Habsburgs. In 1618 Rankweil was granted market rights. Since its founding in 1918, Rankweil has belonged to the Austrian state of Vorarlberg.

==Politics==
Rankweil&#x27;s current mayor is Katharina Wöß-Krall, of the People&#x27;s Party Rankweil. She has been in office since 2019. The local council of Rankweil consists of 33 members.

==Demographics==
Rankweil has been awarded a “family plus”-community – an award from the state of Vorarlberg for family-friendly communities.

==Notability and landmarks==
Rankweil is a place of pilgrimage, known for its Basilica. Other sites include:

Pilgrimage church &quot;Unsere Liebe Frau Mariä Heimsuchung&quot; (&quot;Our Dear Lady Mary Visitation&quot;): The pilgrimage church, also called the Basilica Rankweil, had its beginnings around 700 as a fortress church. It has been at the center of a large parish since the 9th century. The church was badly damaged by a fire in the Old Zürich War in 1445. From 1470 onwards, the church was renovated and expanded. The central image of pilgrimage, a linden wood sculpture of Mary with her child, was created by the sculptor Johannes Rueland in 1470. Since 1757, the sculpture has been embedded in a gold-plated, Rococo-style altar. The church received the title of a Minor Basilica in 1985 and is located on an Austrian stretch of the Camino de Santiago. The church is also depicted on Rankweil&#x27;s coat of arms.

St. Peter&#x27;s Church: St. Peter&#x27;s Church, first mentioned in 817, is located in the old center of Rankweil. It was converted to Baroque-style in 1627.

Open-Air Museum “Villa Rustica”: The Villa Rustica is an agricultural estate, consisting of several buildings; it was built by Roman settlers in the first century AD. In 1954, the remains of a building with an apse and a floor heating were discovered. Between 2002 and 2007, the former main building of the complex and a Roman bathhouse were excavated.

Sigmund Nachbauer Memorial: This monument was inaugurated in 1910. It commemorates Josef Sigmund Nachbauer, who commanded the &quot;Rankweiler Schützen&quot; at the time of the Napoleonic wars; he was their leader in the uprising against Bavaria in 1809, was imprisoned in 1813, and died at Fortress Ingolstadt in the same year.

Town Hall: Today&#x27;s town hall still features the preserved cellar vaults of the original building from before 1500. It has been in the possession of the community of Rankweil since 1822. It has been used as a court house, a town hall, an archive, a school, a poorhouse, a bank, teachers&#x27; quarters, community physicians housing, and gendarmerie officers quarters. Since its renovation in 1998, the building has served as the town hall again.

Wine production at the Liebfrauenberg: The first mention of wine production at the &quot;Liebfrauenberg&quot; was made in the Raetian Reichsurbar, in the year 842. There was an especially prosperous period of wine production in the 14th and 15th centuries. Decades of failed crops, vine diseases, and the construction of the Arlberg railway, which allowed for a cheap supply of wines from Italy, stopped the wine production. The production started again in 1983.

Museum of Printmaking: The Museum of Printmaking opened in 2004. It features a fully functional print shop. The main task of the museum is to document and preserve techniques of printmaking.

Natalie Beer Museum: The museum is dedicated to the poet and writer Natalie Beer, who lived in Rankweil for several decades until her death in 1987. It features personal belongings and most of the publications from the estate of Natalie Beer.

==Culture==
There are 125 clubs in Rankweil. They are active in the fields of sports, culture, music, religion and family life. In the field of music, the club &quot;Altes Kino&quot; has organized concerts with national and international musicians like Zucchero, Bryan Adams, Gianna Nannini, Amy Macdonald, Dave Brubeck and Hubert von Goisern.

Events in Rankweil include the autumn market, the annual fair, and the &quot;Rankweil Sommer&quot;, a holiday program during the summer months, with more than 40 different events. In addition, every other year a carnival parade takes place in Rankweil.

<text>Lavernock () is a hamlet in the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales, lying on the coast south of Cardiff between Penarth and Sully, and overlooking the Bristol Channel.

== Marconi and the first radio messages across open sea ==

Following overland tests at Salisbury Plain during March 1897, on 13 May 1897, the Italian born and recently British based inventor, best known for his development of a radiotelegraph system, Guglielmo Marconi, assisted by George Kemp (who was a Cardiff based Post Office engineer) transmitted and received the first wireless signals over open sea between Lavernock Point and Flat Holm island.

The very first message transmitted in morse code was &quot;ARE YOU READY&quot;. This was immediately followed by &quot;CAN YOU HEAR ME&quot; to which the reply was &quot;YES LOUD AND CLEAR&quot;. The morse recording slip for the first message is on display in the National Museum of Wales.

Following the initial opening exchange there followed detailed technical messages in both directions indicating each end&#x27;s equipment settings and receiving sound levels. Marconi indicated that he was using a spark on his equipment.
The successful test followed several days of trials and failure while adjustments were made to aerial length. Extensive trials were carried out over the remainder of the week in various weather conditions and with different settings on the equipment at each end. Marconi benefitted from the active encouragement of then Mr. William Preece (later Sir William Preece) who was Engineer-in-Chief of the Post Office and had himself transmitted radio telegraph morse signals across Coniston Water eight years earlier. Preece had been previously acted as a consultant to the Bristol Corporation&#x27;s Electricity Department between 1883 and 1893. The Post Office engineers, including George Kemp who kept a detailed diary of these events, had been experimenting for some months at Lavernock Point. Kemp recorded the following in his diary of the experiments:

:&quot;&quot;Mr Marconi&#x27;s apparatus was set up on the cliff at Lavernock Point, which is about twenty yards above sea-level. Here we erected a pole, high, on the top of which was a cylindrical cap of zinc, long and diameter.&quot;

:&quot;Connected with this cap was an insulated copper wire leading to one side of the detector, the other side of which was connected to a wire led down the cliff and dipping into the sea. At Flat Holm Mr Preece&#x27;s apparatus was arranged, the Ruhmkorff coil also giving sparks from an eight-cell battery.&quot;

:&quot;On the 10th May experiments on Mr Preece&#x27;s electro-magnetic transmission method were repeated, and with perfect success.&quot;

:&quot;The next few days were eventful ones in the history of Mr Marconi. On the 11th and 12th his experiments were unsatisfactory — worse still, they were failures — and the fate of his new system trembled in the balance.&quot;

:&quot;An inspiration saved it. On the 13th May the apparatus was carried down to the beach at the foot of the cliff, and connected by another of wire to the pole above, thus making an aerial height of in all. Result, The instruments which for two days failed to record anything intelligible, now rang out the signals clear and unmistakable, and all by the addition of a few yards of wire!&quot;&quot;

Marconi&#x27;s new equipment was therefore used in conjunction with that already adopted by the Post Office. The initial tests were so successful over the stretch of water that it was quickly decided to relocate the telegraph equipment from Flat Holm to Brean Down Fort, near Weston Super Mare increasing the distance to nearly from the Lavernock Point transmitter.

Following these successful trials, Marconi subsequently vested his new patent rights in his &#x27;Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company&#x27;, which unfortunately prevented any further co-operation with the Post Office engineers. However, George Kemp immediately resigned from his Post Office position and joined Marconi&#x27;s new company as head of engineering development.

In 1948, to mark the 50th anniversary of the experiments, a bronze plaque was unveiled by the Cardiff Rotary Club inside the courtyard of the recently closed church of St.Lawrence, Lavernock, commemorating the historic radio transmissions over of open sea. The small stone hut that Marconi used to contain his experimental radio telegraph equipment still stands on the cliff edge at the end of the lane near Lower Cosmeston farmhouse.

== The bays of Lavernock ==

From the late 1890s until 1968 Lavernock and the nearby bays of St Mary&#x27;s Well and Swanbridge (with its low tide walk out to Sully Island) were popular and busy holiday locations for regular day trippers from the South Wales Valleys, Newport, Cardiff, Penarth and Barry and the beaches were packed with visitors on most weekends and Bank Holidays throughout the summer. The hundreds and sometimes thousands of holidaymakers were served refreshments by an ice cream parlour, two busy cafes, the Golden Hind public house and the three star Lavernock Bay Hotel. Very few visitors arrived by car until the 1960s with the majority travelling by the half-hourly steam trains that stopped at Lavernock and Swanbridge Halts on the busy Taff Vale Railway Line en route to Barry Island.

Lavernock started settling back to quiet seclusion in the late 1960s when the railway line closed down under the Beeching Axe. Some modern day trippers arrived by car, to the degree that the lanes and the Swanbridge car park were often jammed, but visitor numbers had dropped off to such a degree that falling profit margins meant all the food outlets, the Golden Hind pub and eventually even the Bay Hotel closed down and the decline was accelerated even further.

== Lavernock Point ==
Lavernock Point () is a headland on the South Wales coast, overlooking the Bristol Channel with views across to the Somerset Coast. Because of the extreme tidal range there are very strong currents or rips close inshore to the point with speeds that exceed for several hours at each tide.

Some sources treat Lavernock Point as the boundary between the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, although definitions of these areas are varied and often ambiguous. It is used as the boundary between Marine Character Areas 28 and 29, named Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary, and the Living Levels Partnership use a definition of Severn Estuary that draws the line between Lavernock Point and Sand Point, marked by Steep Holm and Flat Holm islands.

Various proposals have been put forward to construct a Severn Barrage for tidal electricity production from Lavernock Point to Brean Down in Somerset and the provision remains under discussion by the various agencies.

=== Geology ===
The coastal cliffs which stretch to the north and east of Lavernock Point expose a sequence of sedimentary rocks of late Triassic and early Jurassic age. The strata are assigned to the Penarth and Lias groups and record the inundation of a former desert area by the sea around 200 million years ago. Within the Blue Lias, geologists recognise a St Mary&#x27;s Well Bay Formation comprising interbedded mudstone and limestone and an overlying Lavernock Shales Formation which is a mudstone with some limestone nodules, both named from this locality, though also found elsewhere. Fossils of oysters and other species are abundant in these cliffs.

In 2015 Nick and Rob Hanigan discovered a fossilised skeleton belonged to a dog-sized creature, a theropod dinosaur, and a &quot;cousin of the giant tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. Now named &quot;Dracoraptor hanigan&quot; meaning &quot;dragon robber&quot;, the latter name in honour of the brothers, it was described as &quot;the best dinosaur fossil Wales has ever had&quot; by Steven Vidovic, a palaeontologist at Portsmouth University. The skeleton is now on display at the National Museum Wales in Cardiff.

=== Lavernock Fort ===

On the point in the late 1860s Lavernock Fort gun battery was built by the Royal Commission. It was completed in 1870, with three 7&quot; muzzle loading cannons to protect the channel approaches to Cardiff and Bristol shipyards. Sometime before 1895 the gun battery was reinforced with a fourth cannon, only for all four guns then to be replaced eight years later by two rapid fire six inch (152 mm) former naval guns in 1903.

A two unit searchlight battery was added during the Second World War. The World War II gun emplacements formed part of the &quot;Fixed Defences, Severn Scheme&quot; and protected the Atlantic shipping convoy de-grouping zone between Cardiff, Barry and Flat Holm. Today the remaining main section of the gun battery has been listed as an Ancient Monument, which includes the gun emplacements, director-rangefinder observation position, crew and officers quarters. The structure is still commemorated through Lavernock Point&#x27;s main access road being named &#x27;Fort Road&#x27;.

=== Royal Observer Corps ===
A few yards away from the historic Marconi hut Penarth&#x27;s only World War II Royal Observer Corps (ROC) Searchlight post stood on the cliff edge with its clear views over the Bristol Channel and the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The Observer Corps site was established by the Air Ministry on part of the original War Department land connected to the Lavernock Gun Battery. The volunteer ROC observers spotted many Nazi German Luftwaffe raids approaching across the channel and activated the air raid warnings in the town.

In early 1962 a protected nuclear fallout shelter (or bunker) was completed at Penarth Clifftop for the ROC &quot;(OS Grid Ref: ST 1858 6903)&quot;, who by the 1960s had switched from above ground aircraft spotting to underground operations with instruments to detect nuclear explosions and warn the public of approaching radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear war. The post members were mobilised later that year and volunteers spent nearly ten days underground during the Cuban Missile Crisis as the government prepared the country for potential outbreak of war.

The Penarth cliff top nuclear bunker was closed down and abandoned by the ROC in 1975 after repeated destructive break-ins by local vandals, but the concrete entrance hatch and ventilator tower can still be observed next to the cliff walk near Lower Cosmeston farmhouse. The Royal Observer Corps itself was disbanded in December 1995 after the end of the Cold War and as a result of recommendations in the governments Options for Change review of UK defence.

=== Nature reserve ===
Lavernock Point is established as a nature reserve where wildlife interest is combined with historical interests in a dramatic and picturesque coastal reserve. The unimproved limestone grassland supports varied and colourful plants such as dyer&#x27;s greenweed, devil&#x27;s-bit scabious, common spotted orchid and fleabane. Butterflies have been observed and recorded by the reserve&#x27;s warden for over twenty years and more than twenty five species have been identified.

Lavernock and the nearby Cosmeston Lakes continue to be an important landing point for migrating birds. Many bird migration routes across the Bristol Channel cross the reserve, and Steep Holm and Flat Holm islands act as staging posts. Bird sightings vary through the year, with visiting summer migrants, seabirds off the coast and resident breeding birds.

The reserve is managed by the Wildlife Trust of South &amp; West Wales who state that their aims are &quot;To create and maintain the ideal balance between grassland, scrubland and woodland at Lavernock Point Reserve.&quot;

==Monkstone Lighthouse==

Monkstone Lighthouse is located in the Bristol Channel about east of Lavernock Point. A lighthouse here was established in 1839, but the original iron upper structure was replaced in 1993. The current lighthouse, which is solar powered and operated by Trinity House, comprises the original masonry tower strengthened by vertical and horizontal wrought iron bands, with a red glass reinforced plastic tower on top.

== Lavernock today ==

Lavernock railway station was sold off but long sections of the old railway track bed are still open, from the Fort Road bridge as far as Lower Penarth. It is essentially now a rural greenway and cyclepath. However the track bed in the direction of Sully is either overgrown and impassable and some of it has been sold into private ownership.

Lavernock, St Mary&#x27;s Well Bay and Swanbridge (Sully Island) can still be reached along the clifftop path from Penarth.

The old cafe car park at Swanbridge was developed as part of the newly opened &quot;Captain&#x27;s Wife&quot; public house in the mid-1970s.

The &quot;Marconi Holiday Village&quot; near Lavernock Point, is run by the Lavernock Point Holiday Park and consists of chalets, fixed caravans and touring berths. The licensed &quot;Marconi Club&quot; at the holiday village is open to non-residents.

The small parish church of St. Lawrence is a Grade II listed building with medieval, possibly 12th-century, origins. It closed in 2008 and the building is currently being restored and maintained by a volunteer group, consisting of friends of the church. The group has established a charitable trust intended to maintain the structure, allowing continued access to and enjoyment of the historic building. Church services are still currently held along with occasional public open days.

<doc id="1128923" wikidata="Q758379" url="?curid=1128923" title="Au, Vorarlberg">
<text>Au () is a town in the Bregenz Forest in Vorarlberg (Austria).

==Geography==
The town belongs to the Bregenz Forest, is part of the district of Bregenz, and lies in the &quot;Upper Bregenz Forst.&quot;

40 percent of its 45 km2 area is covered with forest, 34.4% of the area is used as alpine pasture (&quot;Almwirtschaft&quot;) and for other forms of alpine agriculture.

The town itself is unlike most others in the area, as it has no real center. Au is an example of a &quot;scattered village&quot; (German: &quot;Streudorf&quot;). It consists of several districts: Am Stein, Argenau, Argenstein, Argenzipfel, Jaghausen, Kreuzgasse, Lebernau, Lugen, Lisse, Rehmen, Schrecken, and Wieden.

The town hall is located in Argenau, but the parish church is located in Jaghausen. The district of Rehmen also has its own church.

The river Bregenzer Ach, the largest river in the region, flows through Au and divides it into two parts: The one part is called &quot;Schattseite&quot; (meaning “shady side”), and consists of the districts of Argenau, Argenzipfel and Wieden; the other part is called &quot;Sonnseite&quot; (meaning “sunny side”) and consists (mainly) of Rehmen and Schrecken. Alongside the river runs the L200 road, which is the main route through the Bregenz Forest.

=== History ===
The name &quot;Au&quot; likely derives from the Old High German word &quot;ouwa&quot;, meaning &quot;river meadow&quot; or &quot;floodplain,&quot; referencing the area&#x27;s proximity to rivers and streams.

The first known inhabitants of the Au region were the Alemanni, primarily from the Vorarlberg Rhine Valley or the Bregenz area. Permanent settlement likely began between 1200 and 1300, as a chapel was consecrated in Jaghausen in 1372. The land comprising the modern municipality was originally owned by King Rudolf of Habsburg, who later ceded it to the Counts of Bregenz-Montfort. The Counts of Feldkirch-Montfort inherited the area and used it primarily for hunting. During this period, the name ‘Jaghausen in den Owen’ originated, reflecting the counts&#x27; construction of a hunting lodge there. In 1375, Count Hugo von Montfort sold the area to Further Austria.

Au became a center of the Au guild, a group instrumental in shaping Baroque architecture in southern Germany, Switzerland, and Alsace. The Thumb and Beer families of master builders, based in Au, developed the Baroque Vorarlberg cathedral style in the 17th century.

From 1805 to 1814, Au was part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, before being returned to the Austrian Empire. Since 1861, Au has belonged to the province of Vorarlberg.

Following World War II, Au fell within the French Occupation Zone of Austria, where the occupation, including Moroccan soldiers serving in the French army, lasted until the signing of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955.

==Population==
== Politics ==
The town council of Au, called &quot;Gemeinderat,&quot; consists of 18 members, all of them members of the &quot;Auer Liste.&quot; The current mayor is Andreas Simma.

== Culture ==
In 1651, the Auer Zunft (Guild of Au) was founded in Au by Michael Beer. It is an association of builders, sculptors and carpenters. In Au-Schoppernau from 1670 to 1700, more than 90 percent of all male workers were builders. Master builders and craftsmen from the Bregenz Forest in particular, but also from other parts of today&#x27;s Vorarlberg, played a leading role in the 600 churches and monasteries that were built in the Baroque style in the 17th and 18th centuries. Members of the Guild of Au received 60 percent of the more than 700 major construction contracts awarded to Vorarlbergers.

Many important members of the Guild of Au came from the architect families Beer, Moosbrugger and Thumb.

In 2021, the Museum of Baroque Master Builders was opened in Au. It is dedicated to the works of the Guild of Au.

==Economics and infrastructure==

A main economic factor in Au is tourism. Many private households rent out rooms or flats. There are several hotels, many of them providing special venues or events, e.g. wellness, sports,
and motorbiking. Agriculture was formerly the main income source for the village, until the rise of tourism.

==Transportation==
Au is situated on the L200, the &quot;Bregenzerwald Bundesstraße&quot;. Here it connects to the L193, the &quot;Faschina Bundesstraße&quot;, which is the main route to the skiing resort of Damüls.
Public transportion consists of the Postbus Line 40, running from Dornbirn to Schoppernau. In winter there is also a free bus service running through the town for skiers and locals.

==Education==
There is a kindergarten, a &quot;Volksschule&quot; (primary school), and a &quot;Hauptschule&quot; (lower secondary school), all located in a building in the district Schrecken.
The secondary school also serves the towns of Schnepfau, Schoppernau, Damüls and Schröcken.

<doc id="1128924" wikidata="Q725921" url="?curid=1128924" title="William Parker Foulke">
<text>William Parker Foulke (1816–1865) discovered the first full dinosaur skeleton in North America (&quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;, which means &quot;Foulke&#x27;s big lizard&quot;) in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in 1858.

Born in Philadelphia, and a descendant of Welsh Quakers who had emigrated in 1698, William Parker Foulke was an abolitionist, prison reformer, pamphleteer, philanthropist, lawyer, historian and geologist, the last of which directly led to the discovery, which was partially named for him by Joseph Leidy and for which he is now best-known.
Foulke was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1841, though the law could hardly be said to be his life&#x27;s work. Four years later he began an association with the two reforms that would occupy so much time and energy in his short life. Sensitized to the problems of incarceration through his legal training, Foulke joined the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries in Public Prisons in July 1845.

Foulke spent several years comparing alternative disciplinary models and writing on correctional issues in the &quot;Journal on Prison Discipline and Philanthropy&quot;. Following a tour of mid-Atlantic correctional institutions in 1847 and 1848, Foulke was instrumental in erecting the new Lancaster County Prison, and contributed materially to later penitentiaries in several other counties in Pennsylvania. He was associated with the American Association for Improvement of Prison Discipline and the Convention of State Prison Wardens.

Foulke also supported the Pennsylvania Colonization Society, an antislavery organization that resettled as many as 1,000 freed slaves per year in West Africa (Liberia). Despite mounting opposition from different sides, Foulke never wavered in his support for resettlement until his own death in 1865, by which time he was vice-president of the Society.

Foulke financially supported the American Academy of Music, and was a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences (Philadelphia), the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and, like his grandfather John Foulke (1757–1796), the American Philosophical Society.

He was an avid natural historian and geologist, supportive of the first arctic explorations.

==Family==
In 1855, Foulke married Julia DeVeaux Powel (died 1884), daughter of Col. John Hare Powel, with whom he had seven children. One of his children was the biologist Sara Gwendolen Foulke. He died on June 18, 1865.

<doc id="1128927" wikidata="Q671238" url="?curid=1128927" title="Bezau">
<text>Bezau is a town in the Bregenz Forest region, in the western Austrian state of Vorarlberg. It is part of the district of Bregenz. Bezau is a popular tourist destination around the year, due to its vicinity to ski resorts and hiking trails. Its picturesque church was built in 1906 and has as its patron saint St. Jodok. Another attraction is the museum of local history (Heimatmuseum), which is housed in a traditional Bregenz Forest wooden home.

== Geography ==
Bezau has a surface area of 34.42 km2 and is one of the largest municipalities in the central Bregenz Forest.

==Population==


== History ==
Bezau was first documented as &quot;Baezenowe&quot; in 1249. After the construction of its own church in 1497, Bezau became an autonomous parish. In 1656, a Capuchin monastery was founded there. Since 1806, Bezau has served as a district court for the Bregenzerwald region. In 1902, the Bregenzerwaldbahn, a 35.32 km narrow-gauge railway, was inaugurated. This railway linked Bregenz with Bezau until 1983.

=== Heraldry ===
The coat of arms is red with a silver horizontal band through it, depicting a green uprooted spruce tree surrounded by a bronze frame. It has been in use since 1929.

==Education==
There is one &quot;Polytechnische Schule,&quot; one primary school (grades 1-4), one middle school (junior high, grades 5-8) and one upper secondary business school (Bundeslehranstalt: Handelsschule, Fachschule für wirtschaftliche Berufe, Tourismusfachschule).

== Economy ==
With 46 farms and 656 hectares of agricultural land, Bezau benefits from a strong agricultural sector. In addition, some cheese factories are located in Bezau. The dairy &quot;Obere&quot; processes approximately 680,000 liters of milk annually. The dairy &quot;Kriechere&quot; processes about 400,000 liters of milk p.a, of which approximately 90% is traditionally processed into a regional specialty cheese (Bergkäse). In 2013, another dairy, which is part of the Käsestraße Bregenzerwald, opened.

 36 companies, 37 craft businesses, 18 tourist companies and 30 service providers are located in Bezau. Bezau has a workforce of around 360 employees.

== Culture and sights ==
From the beginning of June to the end of October, the weekly market takes place every Friday on the Bezau village square.

Bezau Beatz is an annual music festival that has been taking place in Bezau in August since 2008. The concerts take place in various locations: in the depot of the Bregenz Forest Railway, an art forge, the parish church of St. Jodok Bezau or the Panorama Restaurant Baumgarten.

Between May and October it is possible to ride 5 km of the historic Bregenzerwaldbahn (&quot;Wälderbähnle&quot;), which links Bezau to Reuthe and Schwarzenberg.

The Heimatmuseum Bezau (a local heritage museum) includes a typical Bregenzerwälder farm that offers insights into the traditional way of life of this region.

Bezau is part of the Bregenzerwald Umgang (&quot;Bregenz Forest Walk&quot;). This walking tour offers insights into the architecture and community planning of 12 traditional villages in the Bregenzerwald. While walking over various landscapes, visiting public buildings, homes and everyday objects, walkers gain a comprehensive overview of typical Bregenzerwald architectural styles as they developed throughout the ages.

<text>Wessex Trains was a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by National Express that operated the Wessex Trains franchise from October 2001 until March 2006, when the franchise was merged with the Great Western and Thames Valley franchises to form the Greater Western franchise.

==History==
In October 1996, Wales &amp; West commenced operating the South West &amp; Wales franchise in Wales and the West Country. It also operated services to Liverpool Lime Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Birmingham International, Southampton Central, Brighton and London Waterloo.
In 2001 the Strategic Rail Authority decided to re-organise the Valley Lines and Wales &amp; West franchises, both being operated by National Express. Wales &amp; West became Wessex Trains from October 2001.

Wessex Trains retained the West Country services with the Welsh services transferred to Wales &amp; Borders although Wessex Trains operated services to Cardiff.

==Services==
Wessex Trains ran the majority of local trains in the South West as seen in their route map.

Services ran from Great Malvern and Cardiff to Brighton, Portsmouth, Weymouth and Penzance and on these secondary lines:

*Atlantic Coast Line (Par – Newquay)
*Avocet Line (Exeter – Exmouth)
*Golden Valley Line (Swindon – Gloucester)
*Heart of Wessex Line (Westbury – Weymouth)
*Looe Valley Line (Liskeard – Looe)
*Maritime Line (Truro – Falmouth)
*Riviera Line (Exeter – Paignton)
*Severn Beach Line (Bristol – Avonmouth – Severn Beach)
*St Ives Bay Line (St Erth – St Ives)
*Tamar Valley Line (Plymouth – Gunnislake)
*Tarka Line (Exeter – Barnstaple)

==Rolling stock==
Wessex Trains inherited a fleet of Class 143s, Class 150s, Class 153s and Class 158s from Wales &amp; West.

Wessex Trains leased Class 31 locomotives from Fragonset to haul a set of Mark 2 carriages from 2002 on services from Cardiff and Bristol Temple Meads to Brighton and Weymouth.

==Depots==
Wessex Trains&#x27; fleet was maintained at Cardiff Canton and Exeter depots.

==Demise==
In 2002 as part of a franchise re-organisation by the Strategic Rail Authority, it was announced that the Great Western, Thames Trains and Wessex Trains franchises would be combined to form the Greater Western franchise. This was part of a Strategic Rail Authority strategy to reduce the number of train operating companies providing services from London terminal stations.

Originally it was planned for Wessex Trains to take over the diesel services from Exeter St Davids to London Waterloo on the West of England Main Line operated by South West Trains as part of the South Western franchise.

On 13 December 2005 the Department for Transport awarded the Greater Western franchise to FirstGroup and the services operated by Wessex Trains transferred to First Great Western on 1 April 2006.

<text>King Hye (died 599) (r. 598–599) was the 28th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

The second son of the 26th king Seong, he assumed the throne after the death of his older brother and 27th king Wideok, but reigned only briefly before his own death. The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; describes him as the son of Wideok, but this is considered an error.

His reign saw major inroads from the neighbouring Silla and Goguryeo kingdoms, with Silla occupying the present-day Seoul area and trading directly with China. Baekje&#x27;s commercial positions along the Yellow Sea coast were now dominated by Goguryeo, trading outposts in China were lost to the Sui dynasty&#x27;s unification, and Japan&#x27;s political centralization outgrew Baekje&#x27;s influence as well. The decline of external commerce and influence led to infighting among the nobility.

He was succeeded by his son Beop.

==Family==
* Father: Seong of Baekje
* Mother: a concubine from the Yoon clan (延氏).
** Half brother: Ajwa-Taeja (, 572–645) – left to Japan in 597 where he was called &quot;&quot;Asa-Taishi&quot; and painted a portrait of Prince Shōtoku.
** Half brother: unknown
** Half brother: Imseong-Taeja (, 577–657) – he left to Japan in 611 where he was called &quot;Rinshō-taishi&quot;&quot; and became ancestor of the Ōuchi clan (大内氏).
** Queen: unknown
*** Son: Buyeo Seon/Buyeo Hyosun (扶餘宣/扶餘孝順, ?–600) – 29th King of Baekje, Beop of Baekje.
** Queen: unknown
*** Daughter: Princess Wu Yeong (, ?–?)

<text>Jotunheimen (; &quot;the home of the Jötunn&quot;) is a mountainous area of roughly in southern Norway and is part of the long range known as the Scandinavian Mountains. The 29 highest mountains in Norway are all located in the Jotunheimen mountains, including the tall mountain Galdhøpiggen (the highest point in Norway and Northern Europe). The Jotunheimen mountains straddle the border between Innlandet and Vestland counties (historically part of the old Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane counties).

==Hiking, mountaineering and skiing==
Jotunheimen is very popular with hikers and climbers. The Norwegian Mountain Touring Association maintains a number of mountain lodges in the area, as well as marked trails that run between the lodges and others that run up to some of the peaks. The area has more than 50 marked trails, ranging from shorter hikes to multi day trails.
Mountaineering in Jotunheimen was pioneered in the late 19th century and early 20th century by British mountaineers William Cecil Slingsby, Harold Raeburn, and Howard Priestman, as well as Norwegian mountaineers such as Kristian Tandberg, George Paus and Therese Bertheau. Slingsby&#x27;s 1904 book &quot;Norway, the Northern Playground&quot; contributed greatly to popularizing mountaineering in Jotunheimen among the international mountaineering community.

The image from Gjende shows a cliff trailing down into the lake. At its base there is a popular guest house called Memurubu. The picture is taken from Gjendesheim, a starting point for hiking into the mountain range. There is a very popular trail along Besseggen that follows the edge of the mountainous range to the right, which it is named after.
There is a National Tourist Route, the Sognefjell Road, from Skjolden to Lom, as well as another road, the RV 51, from Gol to Vågå through the special area of Valdresflya.
==Etymology==
Originally there was no common name for this large mountainous area. However, in 1820, the Norwegian geologist and mountaineer, Baltazar Mathias Keilhau proposed the name &quot;Jotunfjeldene&quot; &quot;the mountains of the Jotnar&quot; (inspired by the German name Riesengebirge). This was later changed to &quot;Jotunheimen&quot; by the poet Aasmund Olavsson Vinje in 1862 – this name/form was directly inspired by the name Jötunheimr in Norse mythology.

==Geology==
Jotunheimen is a residual mountain area, which is a mass of rock that has remained in place as the surrounding relief has been eroded. The tops of Dovrefjell and Jotunheimen and other parts of southern Norway are the few remnants of a formerly flat surface that existed in Norway prior to uplift. This surface is now largely eroded and warped. The said erosion formed a series of steps and it is from the highest of these steps that Jotunheimen rise.

==Geomorphology==
The characteristic mountain landforms in Jotunheimen have been sculptured by glacial geomorphology during the Pleistocene, especially during its last glacial period. Whereas the Scandinavian Ice Sheet covered most of Fennoscandia, some mountain peaks of Jotunheimen were not covered by glaciers and remained as Nunatak. Galdhopiggen, Glittertinden or Store Lauvhøi are examples. Towards the west, the Scandinavian Ice Sheet disintegrated in several glacier tongues and caused the formation of the Norwegian Fiords.

==Climate, glaciers and permafrost==

Jotunheimen lays in the transition zone from a maritime climate in the west and a more continental climate towards the east. The high mean annual precipitation in the west leads to a low glaciation limit of less than 1500 meters, the altitude where glaciers can be formed. In the east of Jotunheimen, glaciers are rare and the glaciation limit rises to an altitude of more than 2100 meters. The opposite trend may be registered for the mean annual air temperatures (MAAT). It drops about 600 meters for any given value of a MAAT, 
The MAAT of -3.5 °C indicates areas with occurrences of widespread mountain permafrost. Thus, permafrost existis in large parts of Jotunheimen due its more continental climate.

Since the 1980s, the Jotunheimen area has got increased scientific interest from geologists and geomorphologists due to its climate creating periglacial landforms and widespread and often thick permafrost occurrences. A first comprehensive study on mountain permafrost in Scandinavia was published in 1982. Today, these findings are confirmed at various places, and Juvvasshøi, Juvasshytta and Galdhøi are preferred areas for scientific periglacial research due to yearround good logistic conditions compared with arctic areas.

== Jotunheimen National Park ==
Jotunheimen contains Jotunheimen National Park, which was established in 1980 and covers an area of . The Hurrungane mountain range is also inside the national park with the sharpest peaks in Jotunheimen. Adjacent to the national park border is Utladalen Nature Reserve which covers the Utladalen valley and the mountain Falketind, amongst others.

According to the anthropologist Shoshi Parks, “Three national parks converge in this region of Norway, but Jotunheimen is by far the most spectacular, with 250 peaks over high, including two of the highest in northern Europe – (Galdhøpiggen and Glittertind),”

==Human presence==
The Jotunheimen shoe was discovered in August 2006. Archaeologists estimate that the leather shoe was made between 1800 and 1100 BC, making it the oldest article of clothing discovered in Scandinavia. It was discovered along with several arrows and a wooden spade, leading archaeologists to conclude that they had unearthed an important hunting ground.

In February 2020, Secrets of the Ice Program researchers discovered a 1,500-year-old Viking arrowhead dating back to the Germanic Iron Age and locked in a glacier in southern Norway caused by the climate change in the Jotunheimen Mountains. The arrowhead made of iron was revealed with its cracked wooden shaft and a feather, is long and weighs just .

==Traffic==
Despite the large area of Jotunheimen, there are few roads for car traffic. Between Jotunheimen and Breheimen, the plateau is crossed by the Norwegian County Road 55. To the west, the road continues further from Skjolden via Sogndalsfjøra, Balestrand and Høyanger to the European route E39. In the east, the road leads to Lom. A few small dirt roads lead to different parts of the edge of Jotunheimen National Park, although the area of the national park itself is practically roadless. A small exception, however, is a blind road in the Veodalen to Glitterheim, whose head is inside the national park area near the Glittertind.

<text>Patrick Matthew (20 October 1790 – 8 June 1874) was a Scottish grain merchant, fruit farmer, forester, and landowner, who contributed to the understanding of horticulture, silviculture, and agriculture in general, with a focus on maintaining the British navy and feeding new colonies. He published the basic concept of natural selection as a mechanism in evolutionary adaptation and speciation (directional selection) and species constancy or stasis (stabilizing selection) in 1831 in a book called &quot;Naval Timber and Arboriculture&quot; in which he uses the phrase &quot;the natural process of selection&quot;. He did not further publicly develop his ideas until after Darwin and Wallace published their theories of evolution by natural selection in 1859. It has been suggested that Darwin and/or Wallace had encountered Matthew&#x27;s earlier work, but there is no evidence of this. After the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, Darwin became aware of Matthew&#x27;s 1831 book and subsequent editions of &quot;The Origin&quot; include an acknowledgment that Matthew &quot;gives precisely the same view on the origin of species as that&quot; given in the &quot;present volume&quot;.

== Biography ==

Patrick Matthew was born 20 October 1790 at Rome, a farm held by his father John Matthew near Scone Palace, in Perthshire. His mother was Agnes Duncan, a relative of Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan. In 1807&quot;,&quot; Matthew inherited Gourdiehill from Adam Duncan.

Matthew was educated at Perth Academy and the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate due to the death of his father. Matthew had to take over the responsibilities of managing and running the affairs of a property estate at Gourdiehill. Over the years he successfully nurtured, cultivated, and transformed much of the estate&#x27;s farmland and pastures into several large orchards of apple and pear trees, numbering over 10,000. During this time, Matthew became an avid researcher of both silviculture and horticulture. His research and experience at the modest estate framed a strong base of reference to form his own opinions and theories.

Matthew periodically traveled to Europe between 1807 and 1831 either on business or for his scientific studies. A trip to Paris in 1815 had to be cut short when Napoleon returned from Elba. Between 1840 and 1850, Matthew traveled extensively in what is now northern Germany. Recognizing the commercial potential of Hamburg, he bought two farms in Schleswig-Holstein.

Matthew married his maternal first cousin, Christian Nicol in 1817, and they had eight children: John (born 1818), Robert (1820), Alexander (1821), Charles (1824), Euphemia (1826), Agnes (1828), James Edward (1830), and Helen Amelia (1833). Robert farmed Gourdiehill in Patrick&#x27;s old age, Alexander took over the German interests; the other three sons emigrated, initially to the United States. Matthew became interested in the colonization of New Zealand and was instrumental in setting up a &quot;Scottish New Zealand Land Company&quot;. At his urging, James and Charles Matthew emigrated to New Zealand, where they set up one of the earliest commercial orchards in Australasia using seed and seedlings from Gourdiehill. John Matthew remained in America, sending botanical tree specimens back to his father; these included the first seedlings known to have been planted in Europe of both the Giant Redwood and the Coastal Redwood. A group of trees of these species still thriving near Inchture in Perthshire comes from these seedlings. Matthew gave many more seedlings to friends, relatives and neighbors, and redwoods can be found throughout the Carse of Gowrie; these as well as some elsewhere in Scotland (e.g. at Gillies Hill near Stirling Castle) are thought to have been grown from the seedlings. His reputation as a local celebrity faded in the twentieth century, when he was remembered as a &quot;character&quot; who at the end of his life became convinced that &quot;someone very dear to his heart&quot; had become a bird, and &quot;that was the rizzen he wouldna allow the blackies to be shot in his orchard for fear they would shute her, ye ken, although the blackies were sair on the fruit&quot;.

Matthew&#x27;s house, Gourdiehill, fell into disrepair in the 1970s and 1980s, and was demolished in 1990 when the grounds became a small housing estate; some of the salvaged stone was incorporated in a rock garden.

== Work ==

In managing his orchards, Patrick Matthew became familiar with the problems related to the principles of husbandry in horticulture for food production (and hence, by extension silviculture). In 1831, Matthew published &quot;On Naval Timber and Arboriculture&quot; to mixed reception. Notably, the book contains an addendum that discusses natural selection 28 years before Charles Darwin&#x27;s publication of On the Origin of Species. 

==Charles Darwin and natural selection==
In 1860, Matthew read in the &quot;Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot; for 3 March a review (by Huxley), republished from &quot;The Times&quot;, of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, which said Darwin &quot;professes to have discovered the existence and the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of natural selection, and described its principles&quot;. A letter by Matthew, published in the &quot;Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot; on 7 April 1860, said that this was what he had &quot;published very fully and brought to apply practically to forestry&quot; in &quot;Naval Timber and Arboriculture&quot; in 1831, as publicised in reviews. He quoted extracts from his book, firstly the opening words of Note B from pages 364–365 of the Appendix, stopping before his discussion of hereditary nobility and entail.

He then quoted in its entirety a section from pages 381 to 388 of the Appendix. This lacked a heading, but in the Contents appeared as &quot;Accommodation of organized life to circumstance, by diverging ramifications&quot;. In it, he commented on the difficulty of distinguishing &quot;between species and variety&quot;. The change of the fossil record between geological eras implied living organisms having &quot;a power of change, under a change of circumstances&quot;, in the same way as the &quot;derangements and changes in organised existence, induced by a change of circumstance from the interference of man&quot; gave &quot;proof of the plastic quality of superior life&quot; which he called &quot;a circumstance-suiting power&quot;. Following past deluges, &quot;an unoccupied field would be formed for new diverging ramifications of life&quot; in &quot;the course of time, moulding and accommodating their being anew to the change of circumstances&quot;. He proposed that &quot;the progeny of the same parents, under great difference of circumstance, might, in several generations, even become distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction.&quot;

He described this as a &quot;circumstance-adaptive law, operating upon the slight but continued natural disposition to sport in the progeny&quot;. Matthew then quoted the opening three paragraphs from Part III of his book, &quot;Miscellaneous Matter Connected with Naval Timber: Nurseries&quot;, pages 106 to 108, on &quot;the luxuriance and size of timber depending upon the particular variety of the species&quot; and the need to select seed from the best individuals when growing trees.

On reading this, Darwin commented in a letter to Charles Lyell dated 10 April:

Darwin then wrote a letter of his own to the &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, stating,
As promised, Darwin included a statement in the third (1861) and subsequent editions of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, acknowledging that Matthew had anticipated &quot;precisely the same view on the origin of species&quot; and &quot;clearly saw...the full force of the principle of natural selection&quot;. The statement referred to the correspondence, and quoted from a response by Matthew published in the &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;. Darwin wrote that.
In June 1864, after visiting his son who was farming in Schleswig-Holstein, Matthew wrote to Darwin about his pamphlet publishing five of his letters. The title page of this political pamphlet by Matthew stated his claim to be &quot;solver of the problem of species&quot;. In a letter to Hooker (22 and 28 October 1865), Darwin commented that William Charles Wells, in an essay &quot;read in 1813 to Royal Soc. but not printed&quot;, had applied &quot;most distinctly the principle of N. Selection to the races of man.— So poor old Patrick Matthew, is not the first, &amp; he cannot or ought not any longer put on his Title pages &#x27;Discoverer of the principle of Natural Selection&#x27;!.&quot;

==Matthew&#x27;s legacy in evolutionary studies==
Matthew, Darwin and Wallace are the only three people considered to have independently discovered the principle of natural selection as a mechanism for speciation (macroevolution). Others prior to Matthew had proposed natural selection as a mechanism for the generation of varieties or races within a species: James Hutton suggested the mechanism in 1794 as leading to improvement of varieties, and an 1813 paper by William Charles Wells proposed that it would form new varieties.

===Modern claims for Matthew&#x27;s priority===
Although Darwin insisted he had been unaware of Matthew&#x27;s work, some modern commentators have held that he and Wallace were likely to have known of it, or could have been influenced indirectly by other naturalists who read and cited Matthew&#x27;s book.
* Ronald W. Clark, in his 1984 biography of Darwin, commented that &quot;Only the transparent honesty of Darwin&#x27;s character... makes it possible to believe that by the 1850s he had no recollection of Matthew&#x27;s work&quot;. This begs the question, for it assumes he did read Matthew&#x27;s book. Clark continues by suggesting: &quot;If Darwin had any previous knowledge of &quot;Arboriculture&quot;, it had slipped down into the unconscious&quot;.
* In 2014, Nottingham Trent University criminologist Mike Sutton published in a non-peer-reviewed (i.e. not reviewed by experts in the field) proceedings a research paper that he presented to a British Society of Criminology conference proposing that both Darwin and Wallace had &quot;more likely than not committed the world&#x27;s greatest science fraud by apparently plagiarising the entire theory of natural selection from a book written by Patrick Matthew and then claiming to have no prior knowledge of it.&quot; On 28 May 2014 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; science correspondent reported Sutton&#x27;s views, and also the opinion of Darwin biographer James Moore that this was a non-issue (&quot;below&quot;). Sutton published a 2014 non-peer reviewed e-book &quot;Nullius in Verba: Darwin&#x27;s Greatest Secret&quot; reiterating his argument, and alleging that &quot;the orthodox Darwinist account&quot; is wrong as &quot;Darwin/Wallace corresponded with, were editorially assisted by, admitted to being influenced by and met with other naturalists who - it is newly discovered - had read and cited Matthew&#x27;s book long before 1858&quot;. Sutton included as one of these &quot;naturalists&quot; the publisher Robert Chambers, and said it was significant that the book by Matthew had been cited in the weekly magazine &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Edinburgh Journal&quot; on 24 March 1832, then in 1844 Chambers had published anonymously the best selling &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; which, according to Sutton, had influenced Darwin and Wallace. In 2015, Sutton further repeated his assertion of &quot;knowledge contamination&quot; in the Polish journal, &quot;Filozoficzne Aspekty Genezy (F.A.G.)&quot; (Philosophical Aspects of Genesis), which Sutton asserts is peer-reviewed, and about which, one of the journal&#x27;s editors responded, &quot;As to Sutton, he cannot justifiably claim much credibility for his ideas just because these are published in such a journal like ours, i.e. one adopting Feyerabendian pluralism. If he thinks otherwise, it is only his problem. Any reasonable person should know better.&quot; In addition to his papers and e-book, Sutton disseminates his claims against Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace via several blog sites and Twitter accounts, and public lectures: to the Ethical Society, at the Conway Hall, on 27 July 2014; to the Teesside Skeptics in the Pub, at O&#x27;Connells Pub in Middlehaven, a ward of Middlesbrough, on 2 October 2014; and to the Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group, at the James Hutton Institute, at Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen, on 17 March 2016.

However, there is no direct evidence that Darwin had read the book, and his letter to Charles Lyell stating that he had ordered the book clearly indicates that he did not have a copy in his extensive library or access to it elsewhere. The particular claim that Robert Chambers had read and transmitted Matthew&#x27;s ideas that are relevant to natural selection is also not supported by the facts. The article in the &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Edinburgh Journal&quot; (1832, vol. 1, no. 8, 24 March, p. 63) is not a review but only an abridged excerpt from pp. 8–14 of &quot;On Naval Timber&quot; that amounts to no more than a recipe for pruning and contains nothing of relevance to natural selection. It is headed &quot;ON THE TRAINING OF PLANK TIMBER&quot; and ends with &quot;.— Matthew on Naval Timber.&quot; Even if it had been penned by Robert Chambers, this does not mean that he had read or understood, leave alone transmitted, the other passages of Matthew&#x27;s book that do contain anything relevant to natural selection. Further, &quot;The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; contain nothing of relevance about natural selection. Combining these facts, Robert Chambers had probably not read or received the message about natural selection in Matthew&#x27;s book, likely did not promulgate it in the Vestiges, and probably neither in conversations.

=== Rebuttal of claims ===
Challenges to Matthew&#x27;s claim to priority, or those made since he died, have essentially made reference to the same issues, that his description of natural selection was not accessible and it lacked lengthier development. Other criticisms have focussed on the differences between Darwin&#x27;s and Matthew&#x27;s versions of natural selection, and sometimes Wallace&#x27;s too (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Weale 2015). If Matthew&#x27;s ideas had made the impact on subsequent evolutionary thinking, as claimed, the signals ought to be there, either during Matthew&#x27;s lifetime, or Darwin&#x27;s. Yet, modern claims for Matthew&#x27;s priority have been unable to provide evidence for this, that has withstood fact checking.

====Accessibility and development====
Historian of science, Peter Bowler succinctly summarised some of those main reasons given for why Matthew does not deserve priority for natural selection over Darwin and Wallace,
Ernst Mayr&#x27;s opinion was even more clear-cut:
Richard Dawkins also grants that Matthew had grasped the general concept of natural selection, but failed to appreciate the significance, nor develop it further,
In response to Sutton&#x27;s e-book, Darwin biographer James Moore said many people came towards a similar perception during the 19th century, but Darwin was the only one who fully developed the idea:
In response to Sutton (2015) Darwin and Wallace scholar, John van Wyhe commented, 

To coincide with Sutton&#x27;s presentation to the Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group, Darwin author, Julian F. Derry sent an open letter, saying,
==== Analysis of comparative speciation concepts ====

Sutton&#x27;s claim that Darwin and Wallace plagiarised evolution by natural selection from Matthew also has been refuted by Joachim Dagg,
[Wallace&#x27;s] concept of lineage-adaptation as a sequence of extinctions of less fit and survival of fitter varieties and his gradualism put him closer to Darwin than to Matthew. But he emphasized environmental changes for differential extinction and some form of isolation for lineage-splitting and speciation, whereas Darwin&#x27;s mature theory saw competition as a sufficient cause of divergence, differential extinction, lineage-adaptation and lineage-splitting. This is not to say that Darwin was right in this view and Wallace wrong. By current standards, they were both right and wrong in different respects (competitive vs. environmental selection, sympatric vs. allopatric speciation).
The perspective emerging from this comparison shows at least four unique theories (Matthew, early Darwin, mature Darwin and Wallace), each interesting in its own right. Each theory integrated change in conditions, variability, competition and natural selection in ways that allowed for species transformation somehow. Apart from this similarity, the theories differ significantly from each other in the mechanisms underlying transformation. However, this difference does not lie in the struggle for survival and survival of the fittest, but in the way in which natural selection is integrated with variability, competition and environmental conditions. Transmutation is a convergent result of structurally different mechanisms.
The similarity of Matthew&#x27;s scheme to the theory of punctuated equilibria is equally superficial. Eldredge &amp; Gould (1972) took Mayr&#x27;s model of allopatric speciation and combined it with Wright&#x27;s model of genetic drift in order to explain gaps in the fossil record as results of relatively swift evolutionary change in small and isolated populations. Although catastrophes can produce such populations they are not required, and the mechanism underlying the punctuated record is the drift within small and isolated populations, not the absence of competing species that would prevent species transmutation. Therefore, viewing Matthew (1831) as an anticipator of the theory of punctuated equilibria (e.g. Rampino, 2011) is as wrong as claiming his scheme identical to Darwin&#x27;s or Wallace&#x27;s.

====Darwin&#x27;s contemporaries====
While completing a doctoral thesis on &quot;Disputes of Plagiarism in Darwin&#x27;s Theory of Evolution&quot; at the University of Zielona Gora, where the journal &quot;Filozoficzne Aspekty Genezy (F.A.G.)&quot; (Philosophical Aspects of Genesis) is based, Grzegorz Malec published a critical review of Sutton (2015), in which the main difficulty of valid identification of communication pathways was discussed, along with observations on Sutton&#x27;s alternative approach,
== Natural theology ==
Writing to Darwin in 1871, Matthew enclosed an article he had written for &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and, as well as wishing that he had time to write a critique of &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;, expressed the belief that there is evidence of design and benevolence in nature, and that beauty cannot be accounted for by natural selection. Such a belief is mainstream natural theology, and reveals how far Matthew was from Darwin in realising the potential of evolutionary explanations: for him as well as others, man was the sticking-point.

There is little or no evidence that Matthew held these views as a younger man: there is no discussion of a religious nature in &quot;Arboriculture&quot;.

== Socio-political views ==

Matthew&#x27;s idea on society were radical for their times. Although he was a landowner, he was involved with the Chartist movement, and argued that institutions of &quot;hereditary nobility&quot; were detrimental to society. It has been suggested that these views worked against acceptance of his theory of natural selection, being politically incorrect at the time (see Barker, 2001). The more likely reason is that the obscurity of the location hid the ideas from many who would have been interested. Only &quot;after&quot; Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin&quot; did Matthew come forward in a popular journal, the &quot;Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot;. Matthew also published a book in 1839, &quot;Emigration Fields&quot; (Black, Edinburgh), suggesting that overpopulation, as predicted by Malthus, could be solved by mass migration to North America and the Dominions.

Matthew supported the invasion of Schleswig-Holstein by Bismarck in 1864: his pamphlet on the event was denounced by the &quot;Dundee Advertiser&quot;. He also supported the Germans against the French in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), a war which marked the final unification of the German Empire and the end of the Second French Empire.

In 1870 Matthew became aware of the terrible housing conditions of the workers in Dundee. In a letter to the &quot;Dundee Advertiser&quot; he told readers that the death rate of children under five in the town was 40%, and outlined a blueprint for the redevelopment of the city.

== The Tay bridge ==
When the Edinburgh and Northern Railway (E&amp;N) and the Dundee and Perth Railway (D&amp;P) were seeking Parliamentary approval in 1845, it was proposed by their engineers that from Perth both should share a line running along the south bank of the Tay as far as Newburgh, where the D&amp;P would cross to the north bank, and the E&amp;N leave the Tay and head south to a ferry crossing of the Forth. Matthew had been in a very small minority supporting this, and the D&amp;P as built crossed the Tay at Perth. In 1864, when a bridge crossing the Tay at Dundee was proposed, Matthew urged that a bridge at Newburgh was preferable to a bridge at Dundee, a Newburgh bridge giving much the same reduction in the rail distance between Dundee and the Forth ferry-ports from which passengers could cross to Edinburgh as a bridge at Dundee but doing so by a shorter (and therefore cheaper) crossing of the Tay. He argued the costs of a Dundee bridge were being grossly under-estimated: &quot;To erect a substantial bridge, not a flimsy spectral thing, which might or not vanish as a phantom the first storm, or break down under the vibration caused by a heavy, rapid, moving train, would, in my opinion cost nearly double, and probably much more than double, the sum the Engineer states; upon this I stake my judgement against that of the Engineer&quot;, noting in passing, &quot;from the geological indices, I would expect the foundation to be more regular at Newburgh than at Dundee, consequently better&quot;.

The financial crisis of 1866 put an end to the 1864 Tay Bridge proposal, but it was revived in 1869. Matthew responded with a series of letters to the Dundee papers arguing for a Newburgh bridge, and advancing all manner of additional arguments against a Dundee bridge; it would have a deleterious effect on silting and tidal scour in the Firth; it would prevent navigation upstream of it; it would be torn apart by the centrifugal force from heavy trains rapidly descending the curve at its northern end; it was vulnerable to earthquake, a ship colliding with a pier, or to high wind.

Matthew&#x27;s objections were not heeded, and were not persisted in once Parliament had passed the Bill authorising construction of the Tay Bridge. During construction of the bridge some of Matthew&#x27;s criticisms were borne out: it became apparent that bedrock could not be found at a depth allowing the use of brick piers; the design had to be modified to use lattice-work iron piers of reduced width, and there was considerable cost overrun. The bridge opened in June 1878 and was destroyed in a storm in December 1879: the lattice work piers supporting the centre section of the bridge (&quot;the high girders&quot;) failed catastrophically as a train was crossing the bridge. The high girders and the train fell into the Tay and about seventy-five lives were lost. Whilst it was recalled in the immediate aftermath of the disaster that Matthew had predicted collapse in a high wind as one of the horrible ends to which a bridge at Dundee could come, the disaster is generally ascribed to defects in the design and manufacture of the lattice work piers introduced into the design well after Matthew&#x27;s campaign against the bridge.

<text>A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK or MAP kinase) is a type of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis.

MAP kinases are found in eukaryotes only, but they are fairly diverse and encountered in all animals, fungi and plants, and even in an array of unicellular eukaryotes.

MAPKs belong to the CMGC (CDK/MAPK/GSK3/CLK) kinase group. The closest relatives of MAPKs are the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).

== Discovery ==

The first mitogen-activated protein kinase to be discovered was ERK1 (MAPK3) in mammals. Since ERK1 and its close relative ERK2 (MAPK1) are both involved in growth factor signaling, the family was termed &quot;mitogen-activated&quot;. With the discovery of other members, even from distant organisms (e.g. plants), it has become increasingly clear that the name is a misnomer, since most MAPKs are actually involved in the response to potentially harmful, abiotic stress stimuli (hyperosmosis, oxidative stress, DNA damage, low osmolarity, infection, etc.). Because plants cannot &quot;flee&quot; from stress, terrestrial plants have the highest number of MAPK genes per organism ever found. Thus the role of mammalian ERK1/2 kinases as regulators of cell proliferation is not a generic, but a highly specialized function.

== Types ==

Most MAPKs have a number of shared characteristics, such as the activation dependent on two phosphorylation events, a three-tiered pathway architecture and similar substrate recognition sites. These are the &quot;classical&quot; MAP kinases. But there are also some ancient outliers from the group as sketched above, that do not have dual phosphorylation sites, only form two-tiered pathways, and lack the features required by other MAPKs for substrate binding. These are usually referred to as &quot;atypical&quot; MAPKs. It is yet unclear if the atypical MAPKs form a single group as opposed to the classical ones.

The mammalian MAPK family of kinases includes three subfamilies:
# Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)
# c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs)
# p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38s)

Generally, ERKs are activated by growth factors and mitogens, whereas cellular stresses and inflammatory cytokines activate JNKs and p38s.

== Activation ==
Mitogen-activated protein kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to become active, they require (potentially multiple) phosphorylation events in their activation loops. This is conducted by specialized enzymes of the STE protein kinase group. In this way protein dynamics can induce a conformational change in the structure of the protein via long-range allostery.

In the case of classical MAP kinases, the activation loop contains a characteristic TxY (threonine-x-tyrosine) motif (TEY in mammalian ERK1 and ERK2, TDY in ERK5, TPY in JNKs, TGY in p38 kinases) that needs to be phosphorylated on both the threonine and the tyrosine residues in order to lock the kinase domain in a catalytically competent conformation. In vivo and in vitro, phosphorylation of tyrosine oftentimes precedes phosphorylation of threonine, although phosphorylation of either residue can occur in the absence of the other.

This tandem activation loop phosphorylation (that was proposed to be either distributive or processive, dependent on the cellular environment) is performed by members of the Ste7 protein kinase family, also known as MAP2 kinases. MAP2 kinases in turn, are also activated by phosphorylation, by a number of different upstream serine-threonine kinases (MAP3 kinases). Because MAP2 kinases display very little activity on substrates other than their cognate MAPK, classical MAPK pathways form multi-tiered, but relatively linear pathways. These pathways can effectively convey stimuli from the cell membrane (where many MAP3Ks are activated) to the nucleus (where only MAPKs may enter) or to many other subcellular targets.

In comparison to the three-tiered classical MAPK pathways, some atypical MAP kinases appear to have a more ancient, two-tiered system. ERK3 (MAPK6) and ERK4 (MAPK4) were recently shown to be directly phosphorylated and thus activated by PAK kinases (related to other MAP3 kinases). In contrast to the classical MAP kinases, these atypical MAPKs require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated. The details of NLK and ERK7 (MAPK15) activation remain unknown.

Inactivation of MAPKs is performed by a number of phosphatases. A very conserved family of dedicated phosphatases is the so-called MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), a subgroup of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). As their name implies, these enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing the phosphate from both phosphotyrosine and the phosphothreonine residues. Since removal of either phosphate groups will greatly reduce MAPK activity, essentially abolishing signaling, some tyrosine phosphatases are also involved in inactivating MAP kinases (e.g. the phosphatases HePTP, STEP and PTPRR in mammals).

== Signaling cascades ==

As mentioned above, MAPKs typically form multi-tiered pathways, receiving input several levels above the actual MAP kinase. In contrast to the relatively simple, phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of MAPKs and MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks have stunningly complex regulation. Many of the better-known MAP3Ks, such as c-Raf, MEKK4 or MLK3 require multiple steps for their activation. These are typically allosterically-controlled enzymes, tightly locked into an inactive state by multiple mechanisms. The first step en route to their activation consists of relieving their autoinhibition by a smaller ligand (such as Ras for c-Raf, GADD45 for MEKK4 or Cdc42 for MLK3). This commonly (but not always) happens at the cell membrane, where most of their activators are bound (note that small G-proteins are constitutively membrane-associated due to prenylation). That step is followed by side-to-side homo- and heterodimerisation of their now accessible kinase domains. Recently determined complex structures reveal that the dimers are formed in an orientation that leaves both their substrate-binding regions free. Importantly, this dimerisation event also forces the MAP3 kinase domains to adopt a partially active conformation. Full activity is only achieved once these dimers transphosphorylate each other on their activation loops. The latter step can also be achieved or aided by auxiliary protein kinases (MAP4 kinases, members of the Ste20 family). Once a MAP3 kinase is fully active, it may phosphorylate its substrate MAP2 kinases, which in turn will phosphorylate their MAP kinase substrates.

=== In animals ===

The ERK1/2 pathway of mammals is probably the best-characterized MAPK system. The most important upstream activators of this pathway are the Raf proteins (A-Raf, B-Raf or c-Raf), the key mediators of response to growth factors (EGF, FGF, PDGF, etc.); but other MAP3Ks such as c-Mos and Tpl2/Cot can also play the same role. All these enzymes phosphorylate and thus activate the MKK1 and/or MKK2 kinases, that are highly specific activators for ERK1 and ERK2. The latter phosphorylate a number of substrates important for cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell division and differentiation (RSK kinases, Elk-1 transcription factor, etc.)

In contrast to the relatively well-insulated ERK1/2 pathway, mammalian p38 and JNK kinases have most of their activators shared at the MAP3K level (MEKK1, MEKK4, ASK1, TAK1, MLK3, TAOK1, etc.). In addition, some MAP2K enzymes may activate both p38 and JNK (MKK4), while others are more specific for either JNK (MKK7) or p38 (MKK3 and MKK6). Due to these interlocks, there are very few if any stimuli that can elicit JNK activation without simultaneously activating p38 or reversed. Both JNK and p38 signaling pathways are responsive to stress stimuli, such as cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock, and are involved in adaptation to stress, apoptosis or cell differentiation. JNKs have a number of dedicated substrates that only they can phosphorylate (c-Jun, NFAT4, etc.), while p38s also have some unique targets (e.g. the MAPKAP kinases MK2 and MK3), ensuring the need for both in order to respond to stressful stimuli.

ERK5 is part of a fairly well-separated pathway in mammals. Its sole specific upstream activator MKK5 is turned on in response to the MAP3 kinases MEKK2 and MEKK3. The specificity of these interactions are provided by the unique architecture of MKK5 and MEKK2/3, both containing N-terminal PB1 domains, enabling direct heterodimerisation with each other. The PB1 domain of MKK5 also contributes to the ERK5-MKK5 interaction: it provides a special interface (in addition to the D-motif found in MKK5) through which MKK5 can specifically recognize its substrate ERK5. Although the molecular-level details are poorly known, MEKK2 and MEKK3 respond to certain developmental cues to direct endothel formation and cardiac morphogenesis. While also implicated in brain development, the embryonic lethality of ERK5 inactivation due to cardiac abnormalities underlines its central role in mammalian vasculogenesis. It is notable, that conditional knockout of ERK5 in adult animals is also lethal, due to the widespread disruption of endothelial barriers. Mutations in the upstream components of the ERK5 pathway (the CCM complex) are thought to underlie cerebral cavernous malformations in humans.

=== In fungi ===

MAPK pathways of fungi are also well studied. In yeast, the Fus3 MAPK is responsible for cell cycle arrest and mating in response to pheromone stimulation. The pheromone alpha-factor is sensed by a seven transmembrane receptor. The recruitment and activation of Fus3 pathway components are strictly dependent on heterotrimeric G-protein activation. The mating MAPK pathway consist of three tiers (Ste11-Ste7-Fus3), but the MAP2 and MAP3 kinases are shared with another pathway, the Kss1 or filamentous growth pathway. While Fus3 and Kss1 are closely related ERK-type kinases, yeast cells can still activate them separately, with the help of a scaffold protein Ste5 that is selectively recruited by the G-proteins of the mating pathway. The trick is that Ste5 can associate with and &quot;unlock&quot; Fus3 for Ste7 as a substrate in a tertiary complex, while it does not do the same for Kss1, leaving the filamentous growth pathway to be activated only in the absence of Ste5 recruitment.

Fungi also have a pathway reminiscent of mammalian JNK/p38 signaling. This is the Hog1 pathway: activated by high osmolarity (in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) or a number of other abiotic stresses (in &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;). The MAP2 kinase of this pathway is called Pbs2 (related to mammalian MKK3/4/6/7), the dedicated MAP3 kinases involved in activation are Ssk2 and SSk22. The system in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; is activated by a sophisticated osmosensing module consisting of the Sho1 and Sln1 proteins, but it is yet unclear how other stimuli can elicit activation of Hog1. Yeast also displays a number of other MAPK pathways without close homologs in animals, such as the cell wall integrity pathway (Mpk1/Slt2) or the sporulation pathway (Smk1).

=== In plants ===

Despite the high number of MAPK genes, MAPK pathways of higher plants were studied less than animal or fungal ones. Although their signaling appears very complex, the MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 kinases of &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; are key mediators of responses to osmotic shock, oxidative stress, response to cold and involved in anti-pathogen responses. Asai &quot;et al.&quot; 2002&#x27;s model of MAPK mediated immunity passes the effector recognition signal from FLS2 ⇨ MEKK1 ⇨ MKK4 or MKK5 ⇨ MPK3 and MPK6 ⇨ WRKY22 or WRKY29. However the work of Mészáros &quot;et al.&quot; 2006 and Suarez-Rodriguez &quot;et al.&quot; 2007 give other orders for this pathway and it is possible that these are parallel pathways operating simultaneously. They are also involved in morphogenesis, since MPK4 mutants display severe dwarfism.

== Evolutionary relationships ==

Members of the MAPK family can be found in every eukaryotic organism examined so far. In particular, both classical and atypical MAP kinases can be traced back to the root of the radiation of major eukaryotic groups. Terrestrial plants contain four groups of classical MAPKs (MAPK-A, MAPK-B, MAPK-C and MAPK-D) that are involved in response to myriads of abiotic stresses. However, none of these groups can be directly equated to the clusters of classical MAPKs found in opisthokonts (fungi and animals). In the latter, the major subgroups of classical MAPKs form the ERK/Fus3-like branch (that is further sub-divided in metazoans into ERK1/2 and ERK5 subgroups), and the p38/Hog1-like kinases (that has also split into the p38 and the JNK subgroups in multicellular animals). In addition, there are several MAPKs in both fungi and animals, whose origins are less clear, either due to high divergence (e.g. NLK), or due to possibly being an early offshoot to the entire MAPK family (ERK3, ERK4, ERK7). In vertebrates, due to the twin whole genome duplications after the cephalochordate/vertebrate split, there are several paralogs in every group. Thus ERK1 and ERK2 both correspond to the &quot;Drosophila&quot; kinase &quot;rolled&quot;, JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 are all orthologous to the gene &quot;basket&quot; in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Although among the p38 group, p38 alpha and beta are clearly paralogous pairs, and so are p38 gamma and delta in vertebrates, the timing of the base split is less clear, given that many metazoans already possess multiple p38 homologs (there are three p38-type kinases in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;Mpk2&quot;(&quot;p38a&quot;), &quot;p38b&quot; and &quot;p38c&quot;). The single ERK5 protein appears to fill a very specialized role (essential for vascular development in vertebrates) wherever it is present. This lineage has been deleted in protostomes, together with its upstream pathway components (MEKK2/3, MKK5), although they are clearly present in cnidarians, sponges and even in certain unicellular organisms (e.g. the choanoflagellate &quot;Monosiga brevicollis&quot;) closely related to the origins of multicellular animals.

The split between classical and some atypical MAP kinases happened quite early. This is suggested not just by the high divergence between extant genes, but also recent discoveries of atypical MAPKs in primitive, basal eukaryotes. The genome sequencing of &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; revealed the presence of two MAPK genes, one of them similar to the already-well-known mammalian MAPKs (ERKs, p38s, etc.), the other one showing similarities to the mammalian ERK7 protein. The situation is similar in the multicellular amoeba &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, where the ddERK1 protein appears to be a classical MAPK, while ddERK2 more closely resembles our ERK7 and ERK3/4 proteins. Atypical MAPKs can also be found in higher plants, although they are poorly known. Similar to the situation in mammals, most aspects of atypical MAPKs are uncharacterized due to the lack of research focus on this area.

== Substrate and partner recognition ==

As typical for the CMGC kinase group, the catalytic site of MAP kinases has a very loose consensus sequence for substrates. Like all their relatives, they only require the target serine / threonine amino acids to be followed by a small amino acid, preferably proline (&quot;proline-directed kinases&quot;). But as SP/TP sites are extremely common in all proteins, additional substrate-recognition mechanisms have evolved to ensure signaling fidelity. Unlike their closest relatives, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), where substrates are recognized by the cyclin subunit, MAPKs associate with their substrates via auxiliary binding regions on their kinase domains. The most important such region consists of the hydrophobic docking groove and the negatively charged CD-region. Together they recognize the so-called MAPK docking or D-motifs (also called kinase interaction motif / KIM). D-motifs essentially consist of one or two positively charged amino acids, followed by alternating hydrophobic residues (mostly leucines), typically upstream of the phosphorylation site by 10–50 amino acids. Many of the known MAPK substrates contain such D-motifs that can not only bind to, but also provide specific recognition by certain MAPKs. D-motifs are not restricted to substrates: MAP2 kinases also contain such motifs on their N-termini that are absolutely required for MAP2K-MAPK interaction and MAPK activation. Similarly, both dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases and MAP-specific tyrosine phosphatases bind to MAP kinases through the same docking site. D-motifs can even be found in certain MAPK pathway regulators and scaffolds (e.g. in the mammalian JIP proteins).

Other, less well characterised substrate-binding sites also exist. One such site (the DEF site) is formed by the activation loop (when in the active conformation) and the MAP kinase-specific insert below it. This site can accommodate peptides with an FxFP consensus sequence, typically downstream of the phosphorylation site. Note that the latter site can only be found in proteins that need to selectively recognize the active MAP kinases, thus they are almost exclusively found in substrates. Different motifs may cooperate with each other, as in the Elk family of transcription factors, that possess both a D-motif and an FxFP motif. The presence of an FxFP motif in the KSR1 scaffold protein also serves to make it an ERK1/2 substrate, providing a negative feedback mechanism to set the correct strength of ERK1/2 activation.

== Scaffold proteins ==

Since the discovery of Ste5 in yeast, scientists were on the hunt to discover similar non-enzymatic scaffolding pathway elements in mammals. There are indeed a number of proteins involved in ERK signaling, that can bind to multiple elements of the pathway: MP1 binds both MKK1/2 and ERK1/2, KSR1 and KSR2 can bind B-Raf or c-Raf, MKK1/2 and ERK1/2. Analogous proteins were also discovered for the JNK pathway: the JIP1/JIP2 and the JIP3/JIP4 families of proteins were all shown to bind MLKs, MKK7 and any JNK kinase. Unfortunately, unlike the yeast Ste5, the mechanisms by which they regulate MAPK activation are considerably less understood. While Ste5 actually forms a ternary complex with Ste7 and Fus3 to promote phosphorylation of the latter, known mammalian scaffold proteins appear to work by very different mechanisms. For example, KSR1 and KSR2 are actually MAP3 kinases and related to the Raf proteins. Although KSRs alone display negligible MAP3 kinase activity, KSR proteins can still participate in the activation of Raf kinases by forming side-to-side heterodimers with them, providing an allosteric pair to turn on each enzymes. JIPs on the other hand, are apparently transport proteins, responsible for enrichment of MAPK signaling components in certain compartments of polarized cells. In this context, JNK-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1 (and possibly JIP2) provides a signal for JIPs to release the JIP-bound and inactive upstream pathway components, thus driving a strong local positive feedback loop. This sophisticated mechanism couples kinesin-dependent transport to local JNK activation, not only in mammals, but also in the fruitfly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

== As therapeutic targets ==

Since the ERK signaling pathway is involved in both physiological and pathological cell proliferation, it is natural that ERK1/2 inhibitors would represent a desirable class of antineoplastic agents. Indeed, many of the proto-oncogenic &quot;driver&quot; mutations are tied to ERK1/2 signaling, such as constitutively active (mutant) receptor tyrosine kinases, Ras or Raf proteins. Although no MKK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors were developed for clinical use, kinase inhibitors that also inhibit Raf kinases (e.g. Sorafenib) are successful antineoplastic agents against various types of cancer. MEK inhibitor cobimetinib has been investigated in pre-clinical lung cancer models in combination with inhibition of the PI3K pathway, where the two drugs lead to a synergistic response.

JNK kinases are implicated in the development of insulin resistance in obese individuals as well as neurotransmitter excitotoxicity after ischaemic conditions. Inhibition of JNK1 ameliorates insulin resistance in certain animal models. Mice that were genetically engineered to lack a functional JNK3 gene - the major isoform in brain – display enhanced ischemic tolerance and stroke recovery. Although small-molecule JNK inhibitors are under development, none of them proved to be effective in human tests yet. A peptide-based JNK inhibitor (AM-111, a retro-inverse D-motif peptide from JIP1, formerly known as XG-102) is also under clinical development for sensorineural hearing loss.

p38 was once believed to be a perfect target for anti-inflammatory drugs. Yet the failure of more than a dozen chemically different compounds in the clinical phase suggests that p38 kinases might be poor therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases. Many of these compounds were found to be hepatotoxic to various degree and tolerance to the anti-inflammatory effect developed within weeks. An alternative approach is to evaluate the potential for targeting upstream MAPKs, such as ASK1. Studies in animal models of inflammatory arthritis have yielded promising results, and ASK1 has recently been found to be unique amongst the MAPKs in that it is inducible by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.

<doc id="1128938" wikidata="Q1684865" url="?curid=1128938" title="Jean Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas">
<text>Jean Frédéric [[Phélypeaux]], Count of Maurepas (9 July 1701 – 21 November 1781) was a French statesman and Count of Maurepas.

==Biography==
===Early years===

He was born at Versailles, of a family of administrative nobility, the son of Jérôme Phélypeaux, secretary of state for the marine and the royal household. Under the guidance of his father, his grandfather and his cousin Louis Phélypeaux, marquis de La Vrillière, Jean-Frederic was trained from childhood to be secretary of state to the king of France. Jean-Frederic had right en survivance to the position of secretary of state, under the Regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, as his father Jerome had purchased the office with the right of inheritance.

In 1718 at the age of 17, Jean became the minister of the royal household and Comte de Maurepas under the guardianship of his cousin La Vrillière. Shortly after he married the daughter of his cousin, Marie-Jeanne Phélypeaux de La Vrillière (1704-1793). Five years later on 16 August he began his duties as ministre de la marine to Louis XV administering the navy, colonies and seaborne trade. In 1738 he was promoted to the Conseil du Roi, and in time aided the king, alongside several other ministers in making significant political decisions. Jean continued his administrative career after the death of his guardian, and was ministre de la marine until 23 April 1749, when he was removed in a coup.

===Political rising===

Skilled in military and naval strategy, Maurepas enabled the French Navy to regain previously lost prestige and France was once again recognized as a maritime power. One way that he improved the French reputation was by focusing on the defense of France&#x27;s sprawling empire in the New World, especially in the 1730s and 1740s. His defense plans were aided by information on British naval manoeuvres, lists of what ships were coming to North America and detailed memoirs of ship construction. Jean-Frederic obtained this information through maintaining an intelligence service that was considered one of the most efficient in Europe. This was only made possible due to the drastic funding increases he managed to obtain for the Troupes de la Marine. The typical budget appropriated to the marine from the mid-1720s to mid-1730s was 9 million livres; in 1739, however, Jean-Frederic managed to obtain a budget of 19.2 million livres. In the following years he acquired budgets of 20 million livres in 1740, 26 million in 1741 and 27 million in 1742. Over his career as administrator he held the positions of chamberlain of the royal household, minister of the marine, and director of the secret service, fulfilling his duties with efficiency and precision.

===Political decline===
In 1749, Maurepas was removed by a coup led by the Duke of Richelieu, putting an end to his period of immense success. He was exiled from Versailles for an epigram against Madame de Pompadour, and went to Bourges and then onto Pontchartrain. In 1774, he was appointed to minister of state to Louis XVI, as well as chief adviser in 1776, holding both positions until 1781. He gave Turgot the direction of finance, placed Lamoignon-Malesherbes over the royal household and made Vergennes minister for foreign affairs. At the outset of his new career he showed his weakness by recalling to their functions, in deference to popular clamour, the members of the old Parlement ousted by Maupeou, thus reconstituting the most dangerous enemy of the royal power. This step, and his intervention on behalf of the American states, helped to pave the way for the French Revolution.

Jealous of his personal ascendancy over Louis XVI, he intrigued against Turgot, whose disgrace in 1776 was followed after six months of disorder by the appointment of Jacques Necker. In 1781 Maurepas deserted Necker as he had done Turgot, and he died at Versailles on 21 November 1781.

==Legacy==
Maurepas is credited with contributions to the collection of facetiae known as the &quot;Etrennes de la Saint Jean&quot; (2nd ed., 1742). Four volumes of &quot;Memoires de Maurepas&quot;, purporting to be collected by his secretary and edited by J.L.G. Soulavie in 1792, included information on the North American colonies, the fall of Louisbourg, trade in the Caribbean, the censorship of books and administration. He also recorded extensive information on all naval matters including naval construction, navigation sailing instructions and fighting at sea. The collection of memoirs is now in the possession of Cornell University.

Lake Maurepas, Louisiana, USA was named for him, showing his surviving influence on the New World.

<text>Chlorpropamide is an antidiabetic drug, belonging to the sulfonylurea class of organic compounds. It is used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2. It is a long-acting first-generation sulfonylurea.

==Mechanism of action==
Like other sulfonylureas, chlorpropamide acts to increase the secretion of insulin, so it is only effective in patients who have some pancreatic beta cell function. It can cause relatively long episodes of hypoglycemia; this is one reason why shorter-acting sulfonylureas such as gliclazide or tolbutamide are used instead. The risk of hypoglycemia makes this drug a poor choice for the elderly and patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment. Chlorpropamide is also used in partial central diabetes insipidus.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Maximal plasma concentrations are reached 3 to 5 hours after quick and nearly complete (&gt;90%) resorption from the gut. plasma half life is 36 hours; the drug is effective for about 24 hours, longer than other sulfonylureas. A stable plasma level is only reached after three days of continuous application. 90% of the drug are bound to plasma proteins; at least two albumin binding sites exist. More than 99% of chlorpropamide are excreted unchanged via the kidneys. It is first filtrated in the glomeruli, then reabsorbed, and finally secreted into the tubular lumen.

==Cautions and contraindications==

Chlorpropamide and other sulfonylureas encourage weight gain, so they are generally not favored for use in very obese patients. Metformin (Glucophage) is considered a better drug for these patients. Sulfonylureas should be used with caution or generally avoided in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, patients with porphyria, patients who are breastfeeding, patients with ketoacidosis, and elderly patients.

===Other side effects===
The most common side effects are skin related, such as rashes, photoallergy and (in rare cases) Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Less common side effects of chlorpropamide include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It may cause facial flushing after the ingestion of alcohol. In very high doses it can increase secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which can lead to hyponatremia. It also markedly raises the serum level of alkaline phosphatase.

==Chemical properties==
Chlorpropamide is a white crystalline powder with no characteristic taste or smell. It exhibits polymorphism. Its acid dissociation constant p&quot;K&quot;a is 5.0 at 20 °C.

<text>Spasmodic Caress were an English post punk/new wave band, formed by Peter Masters, that played many gigs along the East Coast in Essex, Ipswich, Colchester and London between 1979 and 1984. They recorded a track for the 4AD Records 12&quot; compilation &quot;Presage(s)&quot; in 1980 and performed at 4ad sponsored gigs in London with other 4ad artists including Modern English, In Camera and Bauhaus. Another track &quot;Register of Electors&quot; was recorded at the same time and is now included in the download version of Presages. They also released two albums, &quot;Hillside &#x27;79&quot; and &quot;Fragments Of&quot; on Falling A Records. Bassist Peter Ashby went on to form The Insane Picnic with Barry Lamb.

<text>Hector Samuel Juan &quot;Tico&quot; Torres (born October 7, 1953) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock band Bon Jovi. In 2018, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bon Jovi.

== Childhood ==
Hector Juan Samuel Torres was born on October 7, 1953, in New York City, and brought up in the Colonia section of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. His parents, Emma and Héctor, emigrated from Cuba in 1948. Torres attended John F. Kennedy Memorial High School in Iselin.

== Music career ==
Torres was a jazz fan as a youth and studied music with Joe Morello. In 1969, he played drums for the psychedelic rock band Six Feet Under. Before joining Bon Jovi in 1983, Torres had already played live with Joe Cerisano&#x27;s R-Band aka Silver Condor in the New Jersey Rock circuit, and in the studio with Franke and the Knockouts, Pat Benatar, Chuck Berry, Cher, Alice Cooper and Stevie Nicks, recording 26 albums with these artists. Torres was also one of the drummers auditioned by Kiss in 1980 after original drummer Peter Criss left the band.

Torres was the original drummer for the glam rock band &quot;T. Roth and Another Pretty Face&quot; and played on their 1980 album &quot;Face Facts&quot;.

=== Bon Jovi ===
Torres met Alec John Such while playing with a band called Phantom&#x27;s Opera and it was this friendship that led to him joining Bon Jovi. When Jon Bon Jovi, the lead singer of the band, approached Torres, he was put off by the fact that Jon was 9 years younger than he was. He said it was Jon&#x27;s charismatic appearance and watching him perform that attracted him to join the band.

Torres is primarily a drummer and percussionist, but he sang lead vocals on a song on the box set &quot;100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, as well as backing vocals on a couple of the early Bon Jovi tracks, notably &quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;Love for Sale&quot;.

== Other work ==
Known as &quot;The Hitman,&quot; Torres discovered another talent: painting. He has exhibited his art since 1994. The successful first show was at the Ambassador Galleries in Soho, New York. Torres is a self-taught painter, who paints expressive pictures which show scenes from everyday life and his life with the band.

His painting talent was shown in one of the three videos made for the single &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home.&quot;

Torres also owns a fashion line for babies called Rock Star Baby.

== Personal life ==
Torres and his first wife divorced soon after the formation of Bon Jovi in 1983. In 1996, Torres married Czech-born model Eva Herzigová in Sea Bright, New Jersey. The ceremony was attended by their closest friends and family including fellow members of Bon Jovi. The band serenaded Eva and her husband with the hit single &quot;Always&quot; during the dance. Their marriage ended two years later. Torres married Maria Alejandra in September 2001, his third marriage and divorced in 2008. They have a son, Hector Alexander, born on January 9, 2004.
When the Bon Jovi &quot;What About Now&quot; tour reached Mexico on September 10, 2013, Torres experienced severe abdominal pains and was rushed to the hospital with appendicitis. About two weeks later, on September 22, 2013, he was hospitalized a second time for emergency gall bladder surgery. Rich Scanella filled in for him, and Torres returned to the tour in Fresno, California on October 8, 2013.

Torres is an avid golfer who frequently participates in the Alfred Dunhill Links Pro-Am in St. Andrews, UK, often playing in a foursome with fellow musician and good friend Huey Lewis.

<doc id="1128945" wikidata="Q425289" url="?curid=1128945" title="Chlortalidone">
<text>Chlortalidone, also known as chlorthalidone, is a thiazide-like diuretic drug used to treat high blood pressure, swelling (such as occurs in heart failure, liver failure, and nephrotic syndrome), diabetes insipidus, and renal tubular acidosis. Because chlortalidone is effective in most patients with high blood pressure, it is considered a preferred initial treatment. It is also used to prevent calcium-based kidney stones. It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin within three hours and last for up to three days. Long-term treatment with chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for prevention of heart attack or stroke.
Common adverse effects include low blood potassium, low blood sodium, high blood sugar, dizziness, and erectile dysfunction. Other adverse effects may include gout, low blood magnesium, high blood calcium, allergic reactions, and low blood pressure. Some reviews have found chlortalidone and hydrochlorothiazide to have a similar risk of adverse effects, while other reviews have found chlortalidone to have a higher risk. While it may be used in pregnancy it is a less preferred option. How it works is not completely clear but is believed to involve increasing the amount of sodium and water lost by the kidneys.
Chlortalidone was patented in 1957 and came into medical use in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 108th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.

==Medical use==
===High blood pressure===
Chlortalidone is considered a first-line medication for treatment of high blood pressure. Some recommend chlortalidone over hydrochlorothiazide. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for lowering blood pressure, while the two drugs have similar toxicity.

Trials of chlortalidone for high blood pressure found that lower doses of chlortalidone (e.g., 12.5 mg daily in ALLHAT study) had maximal blood pressure lowering effect and that higher doses did not lower it more. Chlortalidone and other thiazide diuretics are effective for lowering high blood pressure in persons with chronic kidney disease, although the risk of adverse effects is higher. 

===Left ventricular hypertrophy===
Chlortalidone is used to treat enlargement of the left ventricle of the heart; it works chiefly by lowering blood pressure, and thereby reducing systemic vascular resistance. There is evidence that chlortalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for reducing the mass of the left ventricle of the heart in persons with enlargement of the left ventricle of the heart. Chlortalidone is superior to angiotensin converting enzyme Inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for inducing regression of enlargement of the left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of the heart.

===Swelling===
Chlortalidone reduces edema (swelling) by increasing urinary salt and water excretion, lowering intravascular hydrostatic pressure and thereby lowering transcapillary pressure (see Starling Equation). Edema may be caused by either increased hydrostatic pressure or reduced oncotic pressure in the blood vessels. Edema due to increased hydrostatic pressure may be a result of serious cardiopulmonary disease (which reduces glomerular perfusion in the kidney) or to kidney injury or disease (which may reduce glomerular excretion of salt and water by the kidney) or due to relatively benign conditions such as menstrual-related fluid retention, or as an adverse effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which commonly cause swelling of the feet and lower legs. Edema due to decreased oncotic pressure may be a result of leaking of blood proteins through the glomeruli of an injured kidney or a result of diminished synthesis of blood proteins by a damaged liver. Regardless of cause, chlortalidone may reduce the severity of edema by reducing intravascular volume and thereby reducing intravascular hydrostatic pressure.

===Bone fracture prevention===
Chlortalidone decreases mineral bone loss by promoting calcium retention by the kidney, and by directly stimulating osteoblast differentiation and bone mineral formation. A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that thiazide exposure was associated with a reduced risk of hip fracture. A secondary analysis of data from the ALLHAT study found that chlortalidone reduced risk of hip and pelvis fracture.

===Kidney stone prevention===
Chlortalidone reduces the amount of calcium excreted in urine, reducing the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stones. In people who have had multiple episodes of calcium oxalate kidney stones, chlortalidone lowers the risk of having another episode of kidney stones. Chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for lowering urine calcium levels and is therefore probably more effective.

===Ménière&#x27;s disease===
Chlortalidone reduces the endolymph volume which reduces the hydrostatic pressure in the inner ear chambers; elevated endolymph pressure in the inner ear is thought to be the cause of Ménière&#x27;s disease or ’Endolymphatic hydrops.’ Synthesis of evidence from multiple small, low-quality studies indicates that chlortalidone or other thiazide diuretics are effective for Ménière&#x27;s Disease.

===Diabetes insipidus===
Chlortalidone (or other thiazide medication) is a key component of treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney is unable to concentrate urine because it has an inadequate response to vasopressin-dependent removal of free water from the renal tubular filtrate. By blocking sodium ion resorption in the distal convoluted tubule, chlortalidone induces an increase in excretion of sodium ion in urine (natriuresis). Giving chlortalidone while simultaneously restricting dietary sodium intake causes mild hypovolemia (low intravascular volume), which induces isotonic reabsorption of solute from the proximal renal tubule, reducing solute delivery in the renal collecting tubule and renal medullary collecting duct. This reduced delivery of solute to the collecting tubule and medullary collecting duct allows increased water resorption and higher concentration of urine, which leads to reversal of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by a means that is independent of vasopressin.

==Adverse effects==
Some reviews have found a similar risk as hydrochlorothiazide, while other reviews found a higher risk of side effects.

* Hypokalemia (low blood potassium) occurs occasionally; the risk of hypokalemia is higher in persons who are magnesium deficient
* Hypomagnesemia (low blood magnesium) a review of four clinical trials found that low blood magnesium occurred in 20% of persons within a few weeks of beginning treatment with 50 mg of chlortalidone daily. The risk of chlortalidone-associated hypomagnesemia is higher in persons with diabetes mellitus who have low dietary magnesium intake.
* Hyponatremia (low blood sodium) occurred in 4.1% of subjects randomized to chlortalidone in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Trial, compared to 1.3% of control subjects. The risk of hyponatremia varies from 5 per 100,000 person-years for those younger than 40 years of age to 730 per 100,000 person-years in those older than 80 years of age. Hyponatremia is more likely in persons with certain genetic variants of the prostaglandin transporter SLCO2A1 associated with elevated urinary PGE2 and inappropriately low plasma ADH levels in the setting of low plasma osmolality. Thiazide-associated hyponatremia is often more severe than loop diuretic-associated hyponatremia because the predominant action of thiazides occurs late in the tubular flow, reducing opportunity to apply additional corrective action further along the tubule.
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium level) can occur in normal persons exposed to chlortalidone but is more likely to occur when persons with sub-clinical hyperparathyroidism are exposed to chlortalidone.
* Hyperuricemia, high levels of uric acid in the blood
* Hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol and triglycerides
* Headache
* Nausea/vomiting
* Photosensitivity increased susceptibility to sunburn of skin with sun exposure
* Photoonycholysis detachment of nails from nailbed with sun exposure
* Weight gain
* Gout; approximately doubles the risk
* Pancreatitis

==Mechanism of action==
Chlortalidone reduces reabsorption of sodium and chloride primarily through inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter in the apical membrane of distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. Although chlortalidone is often referred to as a &quot;thiazide-like&quot; diuretic, it is unlike thiazide diuretics in that, in addition to its inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter, it also strongly inhibits multiple isoforms of carbonic anhydrase. Some of chlortalidone&#x27;s diuretic effect is also due to this inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubule. Chronic exposure to chlortalidone decreases the glomerular filtration rate. Chlortalidone&#x27;s diuretic effect is diminished in persons with kidney impairment. By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, chlortalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism (i.e. apical ROMK/Na channels coupled with basolateral Na+/K ATPases). This can result in a low blood concentration of potassium and chloride as well as a mild metabolic alkalosis; however, the diuretic effect of chlortalidone is not affected by the acid-base balance of the person being treated.

There is uncertainty about the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering effect that occurs during chronic exposure to chlortalidone. Initially, diuretics lower blood pressure by decreasing cardiac output and reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume. Eventually, cardiac output returns to normal, and plasma and extracellular fluid volume return to slightly less than normal, but a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is maintained, thus resulting in an overall lower blood pressure. The reduction in intravascular volume induces an elevation in plasma renin activity and aldosterone secretion, further contributing to the potassium loss associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Chlortalidone is slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral ingestion. It has a long half-life and therefore a prolonged diuretic action, which results in continued diuretic effects despite a skipped dose. This prolonged action of chlortalidone despite missing doses may account for the higher efficacy of chlortalidone compared to the shorter half-life medication, hydrochlorothiazide. Chlortalidone is eliminated from the body mostly by the kidney, as unchanged drug. Thus, in persons with diminished kidney function, the clearance of chlortalidone is reduced and the elimination half-life is increased.

As with other thiazide diuretics, chlortalidone crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Chlortalidone may suppress lactation, and has been used for this indication. Due to its long half-life, chlortalidone may accumulate in newborns via breast milk, despite receiving only about 6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.

Chlortalidone is in the sulfamoylbenzamide class. As it lacks the benzothiadiazine structure of the thiazide-type diuretics, it is called a thiazide-like diuretic. Chlortalidone is freely soluble in dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and methanol; it is also soluble in warm ethanol.

Chlortalidone is the official name of the medication according to the (INN/BAN), which is the medication naming system coordinated by the World Health Organization. Chlorthalidone is the official name of the medication according to the (USAN), which is the medication naming system coordinated by the USAN Council, which is co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA).

==Society and culture==
Chlortalidone is banned for some sports (including cricket) because it is a diuretic, and can be used to reduce body weight or to mask the concomitant use of performance-enhancing drugs. Sports such as wrestling or boxing categorize athletes according to body weight; taking a diuretic such as chlortalidone may lower body weight, and thereby permit an athlete to compete in a lighter weight class, which would provide an advantage. Diuretics such as chlortalidone also reduce the urine concentration of concomitantly-taken performance-enhancing drugs or of their metabolites, thus making it more difficult to detect these drugs using urine testing.

<text>Scott Leo &quot;Taye&quot; Diggs (né Berry; born January 2, 1971) is an American actor. He is known for his roles in the Broadway musicals &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;, the TV series &quot;Private Practice&quot; (2007–2013), &quot;Murder in the First&quot; (2014–2016), and &quot;All American&quot; (2018–2023), and the films &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot; (1998), &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot; (both 2002), &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2003), &quot;Dylan Dog: Dead of Night&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1999) and its sequel, &quot;The Best Man Holiday&quot; (2013).

==Early life==
Diggs was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in the South Wedge neighborhood of Rochester, New York. His mother, Marcia (née Berry), was a teacher and actress, and his father, Andre Young, was a visual artist. When he was a child, his mother married Jeffries Diggs, whose surname Taye took. His nickname, Taye, comes from the playful pronunciation of Scotty as &quot;Scottay&quot;. He is the oldest of five children. He has two brothers, Gabriel and Michael, and two sisters, Christian and Shalom. He attended Allendale Columbia School in Rochester and later transferred to School of the Arts. He received a BFA in musical theater in 1993 from Syracuse University College of Visual and Performing Arts.

Diggs performed many times at the popular Lakes Region Summer Theatre in Meredith, New Hampshire. He also spent the summer of 1992 at the New London Barn Playhouse in New London, New Hampshire. His Broadway debut was in the ensemble cast of the 1994 Tony Award-winning revival of the musical &quot;Carousel&quot;. In 1995, he also performed as a dancer in &quot;Sebastian&#x27;s Caribbean Carnival&quot; at Tokyo Disneyland.

==Career==
In 1996, Diggs originated the role of the landlord Benny in Jonathan Larson&#x27;s Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Rent&quot;, which also starred his future wife, Idina Menzel. After &quot;Rent&quot;, he appeared as Mr. Black opposite Menzel&#x27;s character of Kate in Andrew Lippa&#x27;s off-Broadway production of &quot;The Wild Party&quot; at Manhattan Theatre Club. Diggs also played The Bandleader in the 2002 film version of the Broadway revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; and filled in as Billy Flynn on Broadway. He also temporarily filled in for Norbert Leo Butz (an original &quot;Rent&quot; standby) as the love interest Fiyero of Menzel&#x27;s Elphaba character in &quot;Wicked&quot;.

Diggs then moved from stage to television with a role on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. In 1998, he made his film debut in &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot;, which brought Diggs much acclaim and exposure. The following year, he played a tantric sex god in Doug Liman&#x27;s &quot;Go&quot;, and AWOL groom in the coming-of-age drama &quot;The Wood&quot; alongside Omar Epps. Malcolm D. Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot; features Diggs as the title character, an author and best friend of the groom (portrayed by Morris Chestnut).

He also starred in the 1999 remake of William Castle&#x27;s &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;. Diggs was featured in an episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; helping the contestants through an acting challenge. Another notable role of his was on the comedy-drama &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; as a lawyer named Jackson Duper who was the love interest of the character Renee Raddick and the possible love interest of the Ling Woo character.

Diggs portrayed the title character on the short-lived UPN television series &quot;Kevin Hill&quot; which despite critical acclaim was not renewed for a second season. He reprised the role of Benny for the 2005 &quot;Rent&quot; film. Diggs is featured on the following cast recordings: &quot;Carousel&quot; 1994 revival cast; &quot;Rent&quot; 1996 original Broadway cast; &quot;The Wild Party&quot; original off-Broadway cast. He also sings on the &quot;Rent&quot; film soundtrack. In 2002, he reprised his role as the Bandleader in the film adaptation of &quot;Chicago&quot;, and also played opposite Christian Bale as Bale&#x27;s partner/antagonist Brandt in the dystopian sci-fi thriller &quot;Equilibrium&quot;.

In 2003, Diggs appeared on the TV show &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; after being tricked by Ashton Kutcher, while getting a check-up at a &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;-operated doctor&#x27;s office. In early 2006, Diggs guest-starred for several episodes as Will Truman&#x27;s love interest, James, on the eighth season of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. In May, ABC picked up his pilot, &quot;Day Break&quot;, in which he portrayed a detective trapped in the same day and forced to relive it to clear his name of murder; the show debuted in mid-November 2006, but was abruptly canceled due to poor ratings. Although his film and television career continue to move forward, he still returns to the stage frequently. He was seen opposite James McDaniel in Charles Fuller&#x27;s &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Play&quot; at Second Stage Theatre in New York.

Diggs co-starred as Sam Bennett opposite Kate Walsh in &quot;Private Practice&quot;, the spin-off of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, which ran for six seasons from 2007 until 2013. Diggs had a guest role on &quot;The West Wing&quot; as a Secret Service agent in charge of the security detail for the President&#x27;s daughter. He then guest-starred on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; again in a &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;/&quot;Private Practice&quot; crossover event. Diggs had a major role in the live action adaptation of the comic &quot;Dylan Dog: Dead of Night&quot; (2011). He also narrated the ESPN Films documentary &quot;The Fab Five&quot; about University of Michigan basketball players Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. Diggs is one of the stars of the independent film drama &quot;Between Us&quot; that won the grand jury prize at the 2012 Bahamas International Film Festival among its other festival appearances.

From 2014 until 2016, Diggs starred in the TNT serial crime drama &quot;Murder in the First&quot; with Kathleen Robertson. The show ran for three seasons. Diggs is the author of four children&#x27;s books, &quot;Mixed Me!&quot; (2015), &quot;Chocolate Me&quot; (2015), &quot;I Love You More Than...&quot; (2018), and &quot;My Friend!&quot; (2021), all illustrated by Shane Evans (artist).

<text>Real, officially the Municipality of Real (), is a municipality in the province of Quezon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 38,678 people.

This coastal town, located on the eastern shores of Luzon facing the Philippine Sea, is noted for its rural beach resorts.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name Real has no traditional folklore as basis. Its name originated from the arrival of Spanish forces in the place during their regime. They incorporated the area into their territory, naming it “Puerto Real” (), where the name of the municipality was derived. Spanish galleons and ships docked at the port, while reinforced forces were stationed at the nearby Binangonan Del Ampon (now Infanta).

==History==
Spanish forces landed at the site of Real early in the colonization period, calling it &quot;San Rafael&quot;. Spanish galleons and ships docked at the port &quot;Puerto Real De Lampon&quot; reinforced forces stationed at the nearby place &quot;Binangonan De Lampon&quot; or &quot;Binangonan Del Ampon&quot;, now known as Infanta. Located at the coast of Polillo Strait, it was frequently vulnerable to attacks by Muslim sea pirates and bandits. The first inhabitants of the place came from Binangonan Del Ampon. The area later became part of Nueva Ecija in 1803, later of Laguna, and finally of Tayabas (now Quezon).

On December 15, 1960, Real was created into a municipal district, comprising the barrios of Llavac, Cawayan, Capalong, Tignoan, Kiloloron, Lubayat and Pandan from the mother town of Infanta by virtue of Executive Order No. 410. It was later converted to a regular municipality through Republic Act No. 3754 dated June 22, 1963.

On November 29, 2004, Real was hit hard by Typhoons Winnie, Violeta, and Yoyong. About 500 people were either killed or missing.

==Geography==
Real is a small town by the Lamon Bay, facing the Pacific Ocean. It is from the provincial capital Lucena and from Manila. Real has 17 barangays: 14 rural and 3 urban. Its total land area is , the second largest in the province.

<text>The Bishop of Dresden-Meissen is the ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen in the Archdiocese of Berlin.

The diocese covers an area of and was erected as the Diocese of Meissen on 24 June 1921. The name was changed to Dresden-Meissen on 15 November 1979.

==Bishops and administrators of Meissen (968–1581)==
The Bishops resided until 1595 in Wurzen. In 1559 the diocesan temporalities within Saxony were seized by the Electorate of Saxony.

== Apostolic prefects of Meissen (1567–1921) ==
In the Meisen diocesan area located outside of then Saxony in Lower and Upper Lusatia there was no immediate overlord, since the then liege lord of the Two Lusatias, the Catholic king of Bohemia (in personal union Holy Roman Emperor) held the Lusatias as fief outright. The Kings of Bohemia did not effectively offend the spreading of the Protestant Reformation in the Two Lusatias. So it depended on the local vassals if Lutheranism prevailed or not, following the principle of Cuius regio, eius religio. The Two Lusatias thus became an area of regionally altering predominant denomination. In 1560 Meissen&#x27;s last bishop John IX had appointed Johannes Leisentritt as diocesan administrator for the Lusatian part of the diocese, seated in Bautzen. After the Holy See had recognised as a matter of fact the suppression of the Meissen diocese within Saxony it converted its Lusatian part into an apostolic prefecture (Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen) in 1567 with administrator Leisentrit elevated to prefect. In canon law an apostolic prefecture is a diocese on approval. 

According to its seat or its area comprised the prefecture was alternatively also called &quot;Apostolic Prefecture of Bautzen&quot; or &quot;Apostolic Prefecture of the Two Lusatias&quot;, respectively. When in 1635 the Lutheran Electorate of Saxony annexed the Two Lusatias it guaranteed in the cession contract (&quot;Traditionsrezess&quot;) with Bohemia to leave the existing religious relations untouched. As a signatory of the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 Saxony later agreed to maintain the religious status quo as given in the reference year of 1624 in all its territories acquired since. After the Prussian annexation of Lower Lusatia and easterly Upper Lusatia in 1815 the Holy See disentangled the newly Prussian diocesan area and incorporated it into the Prussian diocese of Breslau in 1821. The remaining diocese, officially always called Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen, was thus also called the &quot;Apostolic Prefecture of (Saxon) Upper Lusatia&quot;. The office of the apostolic prefect was held in personal union by the cathedral dean of Bautzen Cathedral. In the 19th century the episcopal function of the apostolic prefects was further emphasised by appointing them simultaneously with titular sees. In 1831-1841 and since 1846 until 1920 the Apostolic Vicars of the Saxony hereditary lands were also prefects of Lusatia.

<doc id="1128974" wikidata="Q1047528" url="?curid=1128974" title="Manych">
<text>The Manych () is a river in the Black Sea–Caspian Steppe of Southern Russia. It flows through the western and central part of the Kuma–Manych Depression. In ancient times, it was known as the Lik.

A tributary of the Don, it is long, with its current source at the mouth of the Kalaus in the southwestern part of the Republic of Kalmykia. It flows through the town of Proletarsk and joins the Don in Manychskaya, east of the city of Rostov-on-Don.

Along the Manych, going downstream, there are:
*Dam at at the mouth of the Kalaus River blocking flow eastward to East Manych
*Lysyy Liman Reservoir (Dam at ) in between these two dams
*A section that is almost dry 
*Lake Manych-Gudilo
*Proletarsk (Proletarskoye) Reservoir (Пролетарское водохранилище) (Dam at , near the town of Proletarsk)
*Vesyolovskoye Reservoir (Весёловское водохранилище) (Dam at , near Vesyoly).
*Ust-Manych Reservoir near the river mouth (Усть-Манычское водохранилище) (Dam at )

The Proletarsk Dam is sufficiently high to raise the water level in Lake Manych-Gudilo upstream from it, so in fact the lake has become part of the Proletarsk Reservoir. The three reservoirs (and Lake Manych-Gudilo) form an almost continuous chain, the original course of the river being almost entirely flooded by them. According to the calculations of the Russian geographer Alexander Bazelyuk, between Manych-Gudilo and the river mouth, merely of the length of the West Manych river remains in its original &quot;river&quot; (rather than reservoir) form: from the Vesyolovsk Dam to the upper reaches of the Ust-Manych Reservoir, and from the Ust-Manych Dam to where the river joins the Don.

==Unusual drainage system==
Formerly, at least in periods of high water, the Manych River would flow in two directions. The river Kalaus, when reaching the Kuma–Manych Depression at , would split. About 30% of the water would become the West Manych and flow northwest to, or toward, the Don River. The remaining water became the East Manych and flowed roughly southeast and dried up on the steppe before reaching the Caspian Sea. Sometime around 1970 a low dam was built which prevented any water from flowing into the East Manych. The East Manych is now fed by irrigation canals coming from the Kuma and Terek Rivers.

==Canals==
Historically (prior to the construction of the dams and irrigation channels, i.e. until 1932–1940 for the West Manych, and until 1969 for the East Manych), both rivers were intermittent. During dry years, and even during the drier parts of normal years, both Manych Rivers would consist merely of a chain of small lakes or ponds with brackish or salty water. The system usually would be fully filled with fresh water only during the spring freshet.

Since the mid-20th century both Manych Rivers receive significant amounts of fresh water via a network of irrigation canals. Since 1948–1953, the West Manych has been receiving water from the Kuban River (via the Nevinnomyssk Canal and the Yegorlyk, a left tributary of the West Manych) and from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir on the Don (via the Don Canal). Since the late 1960s, the East Manych has been receiving water from the Terek River and the Kuma River via the Kuma–Manych Canal and Terek–Kuma Canal. According to A. Bazelyuk&#x27;s calculations, the annual water flow in the West Manych (measured at the Vesyoly township) is 8.3 times as high as it was previous to the canal and dam constructions, while that in the East Manych (measured at the Chogray Dam) is 4.3 times as high as before.

If the plans for the proposed Eurasia Canal, linking the Caspian Sea with the Black Sea, are ever implemented, it will likely follow the Manych valley in its central and western section.

<doc id="1128980" wikidata="Q5106854" url="?curid=1128980" title="Chris Helme">
<text>Christopher Alan Helme (born 22 July 1971 in Howden, Yorkshire) is an English singer-songwriter, formerly the frontman of John Squire&#x27;s post-Stone Roses band The Seahorses.

==History==

===Early days (1990–1996)===
Helme began singing and performing at the age of 19, and began playing in pubs and folk clubs in his native York with his first band Daisy Space/Genuine Moon Material before forming folk-jazz band Chutzpah in 1993. The band regularly gigged at the White Swan Pub and Fibbers, where Helme worked behind the bar. In 1995 the band busked across rural France before splitting up (the band went on to reform in 2007 for a one-off gig at The White Swan).

===The Seahorses (1996–1999)===
A friend of John Squire&#x27;s long-time guitar technician Martin Herbet discovered Helme busking outside Woolworths department store in York&#x27;s Coney Street. Impressed by Helme&#x27;s version of The Rolling Stones song, &quot;No Expectations&quot;, he requested a demo tape and passed it on to Squire. Squire went to see Helme perform at Fibbers on 26 May and 16 June 1996. Another gig was then arranged at the Roadhouse venue in Manchester, where Squire invited Helme to join his new band, for which he had already recruited bassist Stuart Fletcher.

Geffen Records, to whom Squire was still under contract following his departure from The Stone Roses, signed the band. The Seahorses released their debut album &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; in 1997. The album was produced by Tony Visconti and spawned three hit singles. &quot;Love is the Law&quot; reached no. 2 in the UK Singles Chart; &quot;Blinded by the Sun&quot; got to no. 7 and &quot;Love Me and Leave Me&quot; at no. 15. The stand-alone single &quot;You Can Talk to Me&quot;, co-written by Squire and Helme peaked at no. 15.

In January 1999, after two years of intensive touring, including support slots to The Rolling Stones, U2 and Oasis, a press release sent to the &quot;NME&quot; announced the split of the Seahorses &quot;due to John Squire&#x27;s and lead singer Chris Helme&#x27;s irreconcilable differences over the musical direction the band should take&quot;.

Both Helme and Squire later gave conflicting reasons for the split. Helme claimed that &quot;there was a personality clash during rehearsals. When he (Squire) came up with new stuff I didn&#x27;t like his lyrics or tunes. I could have gone with it and made quite a lot of money, but I wasn&#x27;t interested.&quot; Squire later commented on his reasons for ending the band that &quot;I thought, &#x27;This sounds shit, we don&#x27;t deserve to be in this place.&#x27; The band sounded complacent. I don&#x27;t suppose it was anyone&#x27;s fault. Maybe it got far too much attention for very little effort in the early stages, because of what I&#x27;d done in the past.&quot;

===Solo and The Yards (1999–2009)===
Following The Seahorses&#x27; early demise, Helme undertook a short solo tour across England which culminated with a gig at the Improv Theatre in London. Backed by a newly formed band featuring members of York band, &#x27;The Lo Beams&#x27;, Fraser Smith of Shed Seven and fellow ex-Seahorse, Stuart Fletcher performing material written whilst in The Seahorses. The gigs were confirmed just 11 days following the official announcement of the Seahorses&#x27; split.

Following these initial gigs, which the &quot;NME&quot; described as &quot;fairly unambitious rock music&quot;, Helme abandoned the band format and returned to his native York where he performed sporadic low-key solo acoustic shows. In 2000 Helme started working with session guitarist James Nisbet and began playing showcase gigs in London backed by a revolving cast of session musicians, which at one point featured drummer Toby Drummond, who temporarily replaced Andy Watts in The Seahorses. With a full band, Helme headlined his biggest gig to date as a solo artist, at the Theatre Royal in York in May 2000.

In 2001 a permanent backing band was assembled with Nisbet, drummer John Miller and Stuart Fletcher back on bass. With new management and PR, an official website was launched and a 3 track demo CD was serviced to the media.
With the new band, Helme performed numerous London showcase gigs at Ritz and undertook a short UK tour in November of that year.

Helme then went on to form The Yards with members of his solo backing band. Initially named Super Zero, the band originally featured former Shed Seven guitarist Paul Banks who left before the release of their debut EP &quot;The Devil Is Alive and Well in D.C.&quot; in April 2003. The band released their self-titled debut album in 2005 and second album &quot;Imperial Measures&quot; in 2009 via their own label Industrial Erotica. The band split in November 2009 with members pursuing their own projects.

===Solo (2009 – present)===
Helme set up an independent record label, promo company and booking agency &quot;Little Num Num Music&quot; with fellow York musician Andy Gaines. It was on this label that Helme released his debut solo album, &quot;Ashes&quot;, in May 2008. He toured the UK extensively to coincide with the release and followed up with a single, &quot;Pleased&quot;, in 2010 which was taken from his second album. 
In August 2012 Helme released second album &quot;The Rookery&quot; to positive reviews. Recorded in 11 days the album was produced by Chris Helme with Sam Forrest (of Nine Black Alps). Helme continues to tour as a solo artist and with a full band and a third album is slated for release in 2015. On 26 May 2022, Chris played an acoustic solo performance of Do It Yourself in its entirety at Bridlington Spa in East Yorkshire. The gig was played 25 years to the day since the original album release date of 26 May 1997.

He joined Bon Jovi as a session/touring band member in November 1994, and was later made a permanent member in 2016. Before joining Bon Jovi, McDonald was the bass guitarist for the David Bromberg Band, touring extensively worldwide and playing on many Bromberg albums. He has played with many other artists, both live and in the studio, including Willie Nelson, Steve Goodman, Ringo Starr, Lita Ford, Michael Bolton, Cher, Alice Cooper, Ricky Martin, Gavin Whittaker, Michael Bublé, Poison, and did a few dates during Shania Twain&#x27;s the Woman in Me TV tour.

He has worked with Bon Jovi in the studio since its inception and has been their bass guitarist since original bass guitarist Alec John Such&#x27;s departure after &quot;Cross Road&quot; (released in 1994) but was still regarded as an &#x27;unofficial&#x27; member of Bon Jovi until 2016. At this time, McDonald was left out of most publicity shoots and album covers but did appear in some of the band&#x27;s promo videos. The band members said they never agreed to officially replace Such. Regardless, his work with the band earned him a 1995 &quot;Metal Edge&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Award for &quot;Best Bassist&quot; (tying with White Zombie&#x27;s Sean Yseult). 
McDonald was one of the studio musicians that recorded Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s original first demo for the song &quot;Runaway&quot;. When the song became a local hit, Jon Bon Jovi nevertheless assembled a band without McDonald in order to record a full band album around the hit song. He has also appeared on Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s solo album &quot;Destination Anywhere&quot; and was part of Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s backing group, The Big Dogs.

McDonald married his long-term partner, Nancy in 1996 but they divorced some years later.

In 2004, McDonald married Kelli, a horse trainer and jewelry designer. McDonald has two children, one of whom, a stepson, is also a musician. In 2018, McDonald was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bon Jovi.

<text>Villeneuve-Saint-Georges () is a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris. People from Villeneuve-Saint-Georges are called &quot;Villeneuvois&quot; in French.

==History==
===Prehistory and Antiquity===
Villeneuve-Saint-Georges was settled during the Paleolithic and the Neolithic ages at the meeting of the Yerres and the Seine rivers, as well at Triage, with evidence from archeological remains found by Francis Martin in the 19th century, which includes flints and some stone tools.

After the battle of Melun during the Roman Empire, the area was integrated into the Roman Empire. A small town was built around the area, with the name of &quot;Villa Nova&quot; (Latin for &quot;new house&quot;).

===Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages, Villeneuve-Saint-Georges was a possession of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. The addition of &quot;Saint-Georges&quot; in the name of the commune was after the remains of Saint George was brought back in AD 858. The strategic position on the road between Paris towards the cities of Melun, Clermont-Ferrand and Lyon made it a transport hub and wan regularly visited and traversed by kings and dukes. The importance of the towns led it to be plundered, raided and besieged many times, including during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

The city mostly relied on farming and wine-making for income.

===Renaissance and Modern Times===
During the Siege of Paris in 1590, Captain Saint-Paul forced his way into Villeneuve-Saint-Georges and killed the 200-300 men under the name of Henry IV of France who were garrisoned there, whilst delivering food and assistance to the besieged people in Paris.

During the modern times, Villeneuve became a bourgeois city. Mansions, like the castles of Beauregard and Bellevue were built in the area, and people of the higher classes visited Villeneuve, like Henry IV of France, Catherine de&#x27; Medici and Mme of Sévigné.

In 1652, The Prince of Condé rebelled, and Charles IV sent Turenne to confront him. A battle took place between them in the area.

===Revolution and the 19th Century===
During the Revolution, the national guard was created and the church was looted. Shortly after that Villeneuve became a quiet town again. Many people came to live in Villeneuve, including composers (Boieldieu), painters (Francesco Casanova, Karl Joseph Kuwasseg) naturalists (Charles Athanase Walckenaer), ministers (Victor Duruy), ceramists (Jean-Paul Louis Chesnel-Larossière), and ambassadors (Louis-Jules Mancini-Mazarini). Many personalities, such as Napoleon, Joachim Murat and Prince Eugène, also stopped in Villeneuve. In 1876, Fort Villeneuve was built to protect Paris in anticipation of a future war. The establishment of the railway in 1847 transformed the city, with the agricultural village very quickly became a working-class town.

===20th Century===

On the eve of the First World War, Villeneuve-Saint-Georges had more than 10,000 inhabitants. It was the first railway town in the country with the largest sorting in Europe. The Foyer and HBM sets were built at this time.

On 30 July 1908, following the calls for a 24-hour general strike launched by the General Confederation of Labour to demand a 10-hour day, weekly rest, a salary increase and the end of Piece work, thousands of demonstrators gathered in Vigneux-sur-Seine and Draveil, then converged in the town where a violent confrontation took place between the National Gendarmerie and the workers. The result fight left four dead and more than 200 injured among the workers, and 69 injured on the side of the forces of order. A local odonym (“Place du 30-Juillet-1908”) recalls these events. The next day, Georges Clemenceau ordered the arrest of thirty leaders of the CGT, including its general secretary Victor Griffuelhes, to neutralize the union.

A painting by Théodore Rousseau, titled &quot;La Seine à Villeneuve-Saint-Georges&quot;, which was in the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille was destroyed in 1916.
During the First World War, Villeneuve-Saint-Georges hosted the 232nd Territorial Infantry Regiment (normally quartered in Argentan). The school hospital becomes the Auxiliary Hospital of the Military Wounded Relief Society (HASSBM) No.42, while the Ferry School Group becomes the Auxiliary Hospital of the Ladies of France Association (HAADF) No.248.

After the introduction of paid leave, at the time of the great departures on vacation, a derailment on 30 July 1937 left twenty-nine dead and one hundred and eleven injured at the junction between the Brunoy and Corbeil lines.

During the Second World War, the city was bombarded by Allied aircraft because the Wehrmacht used the railway installations. Many Resistance fighters are also killed after the “Triage sabotage”. After these events, a new demographic surge saw the construction of large housing estates in the North part of Villeneuve.

On 1 January 1968 Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, which until then had been part of the department of Seine-et-Oise, became one of the municipalities of the new Val-de-Marne.

===21st Century===
The town, compared to the rest of Val-de-Marne, is perceived as noisy and undesirable place to go. It has lost its charm during the 18th and 19th centuries, and starting from 1980 workers have deserted the city, leaving a mostly immigrant population, most from the Maghreb and Subsaharan Africa. 

The Route Nationale 6 cuts through the commune and runs parallel to the RER line, producing much noise. The N6 is also famous for having long traffic jams at the junction between the N6, N406 and the A86 Ring road.

==Transport==
Villeneuve-Saint-Georges is served by two stations on Paris RER line D: Villeneuve-Triage and Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. It is also the site of the Villeneuve-Saint-Georges marshalling yard.

<text>Edward Verrall Lucas, (11/12 June 1868 – 26 June 1938) was an English humorist, essayist, playwright, biographer, publisher, poet, novelist, short story writer and editor.

Born to a Quaker family in Eltham, on the fringes of London, Lucas began work at the age of sixteen, apprenticed to a bookseller. After that he turned to journalism, and worked on a local paper in Brighton and then on a London evening paper. He was commissioned to write a biography of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet. This led to further commissions, including the editing of the works of Charles Lamb.

Lucas joined the staff of the humorous magazine &quot;Punch&quot; in 1904, and remained there for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer, most celebrated for his short essays, but he also produced verses, novels and plays.

From 1908 to 1924 Lucas combined his work as a writer with that of publisher&#x27;s reader for Methuen and Co. In 1924 he was appointed chairman of the company.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Lucas was born in Eltham, Kent, the second son of the four sons and three daughters of Alfred Lucas and his wife, Jane &quot;née&quot; Drewett. The Lucases were a Quaker family, and the young Lucas was educated at Friends School in Saffron Walden. His father&#x27;s financial incompetence prevented Lucas from going to a university, and at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a Brighton bookseller.

In 1889 Lucas joined the staff of the &quot;Sussex Daily News&quot;. The following year he published, anonymously, his first volume of poems, &quot;Sparks from a Flint&quot;. With financial help from an uncle he moved to London to attend lectures at University College, after which he joined the staff of &quot;The Globe&quot;, one of London&#x27;s evening papers. His duties there allowed him a great deal of spare time, and he read extensively in the Reading Room of the British Museum. In 1897 he married (Florence) Elizabeth Gertrude, daughter of Colonel James Theodore Griffin, of the United States army; there was one child of the marriage, Audrey Lucas, who became an actor, playwright and novelist. Elizabeth Lucas was a writer, and husband and wife collaborated on several children&#x27;s books.

===Writer===
Lucas&#x27;s Quaker background led to a commission from the Society of Friends for a biography of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet and friend of Charles Lamb. The success of the book was followed by further commissions from leading publishers; the most important of these commissions was a new edition of Lamb&#x27;s works, which eventually amounted to seven volumes, with an associated biography, all published between 1903 and 1905. His biographer Katharine Chubbuck writes, &quot;These works established him as a critic, and his &quot;Life of Charles Lamb&quot; (1905) is considered seminal.&quot; In 1904, while in the middle of his work on Lamb, he joined the staff of &quot;Punch&quot;, remaining there for more than thirty years. Lucas introduced his &quot;Punch&quot; colleague A A Milne to the illustrator E H Shepard with whom Milne collaborated on two collections of verse and the two Winnie-the-Pooh books.

Lucas was prolific; by Max Beerbohm&#x27;s estimation he spoke fewer words than he wrote. Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Punch&quot; colleague E V Knox commented, &quot;Lucas&#x27;s publications include many anthologies and about thirty collections of light essays, on almost any subject that took his fancy, and some of the titles which he gave to them, &quot;Listener&#x27;s Lure&quot; (1905), &quot;One Day and Another&quot; (1909), &quot;Old Lamps for New&quot; (1911), &quot;Loiterer&#x27;s Harvest&quot; (1913), &quot;Cloud and Silver&quot; (1916), &quot;A Rover I Would Be&quot; (1928), indicate sufficiently the lightness, gaiety, and variety of their contents.&quot; He wrote travel books, parodies, and books about painters. Of the last he said, &quot;I know very little about pictures, but I like to write about them for the benefit of those who know less.&quot; Frank Swinnerton wrote of him:
Lucas&#x27;s fluency was thought by some to dilute his skill. Although Swinnerton declared Lucas&#x27;s essays &quot;among the most agreeable of our age&quot;, Agnes Irene Smith wrote in &quot;The Sewanee Review&quot; of Lucas that despite his huge output &quot;he seems to have left no finger prints. Eminently readable, he is read without being remembered; unusually quotable, he was never quoted much and seems never to be quoted any more.&quot; In 1910 Lucas wrote the short article on Jane Austen in the 11th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

Before the First World War, Lucas was for a while interested in the theatre. His play &quot;The Visit of the King&quot; was produced at the Palace Theatre in 1912, but was not well received.[10]

Lucas was athletic and enjoyed billiards as well as cricket. He was a member of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s team the &quot;Allahakbarries&quot;, along with Henry Herbert La Thangue and Arthur Conan Doyle. Rupert Hart-Davis collected and published a collection of Lucas&#x27;s essays, &quot;Cricket All His Life&quot;, which John Arlott called &quot;the best written of all books on cricket&quot;. His study of &quot;Highways and Byways in Sussex&quot; continues to influence postmodern explorations of the local; while his 1932 memoirs &quot;Reading, Writing and Remembering&quot; retained their interest longer than most of his other essays.

===Later years===
Lucas had a long association with the publishing house Methuen and Co, which published his edition of Lamb. From 1908 to 1924 he was a reader for the firm; in 1924 he was appointed its chairman, a post he occupied with considerable success.

Lucas received honorary degrees from the Universities of St Andrews and Oxford, and was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1932. He was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1928, and from 1933 until his death he was a member of the Crown Lands Advisory Committee.

In his later years Lucas cut his domestic ties and lived alone, spending his evenings in restaurants and clubs, and developing a wide collection of pornography. He was a member of the Athenæum, Beefsteak, Buck&#x27;s and the Garrick. When he was stricken with his final illness he steadfastly refused to allow his friends into his sickroom.

Lucas died in a nursing home in Marylebone, London, at the age of 70.

<text>Bizau is a town in the Bregenz Forest in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, part of the district Bregenz. The municipality has around 1080 inhabitants.

==Population==

== Cultural places of interest ==
The Parish Church Hl. Valentin was built in 1472. 

The Wetzsteinhöhle (&quot;Whetstone Cave&quot;) is a manmade dry cavity, a former mine for sandstone. The Hüttbach stream flows down below the cave.

In 2007, the municipality of Bizau declared a wooden fence (&quot;Steackohag&quot;) a protected monument. The fence commemorates the traditional &quot;Alpgasse&quot;, on which the cattle were transported to and from the mountain pastures (see Alpine Transhumance), while also symbolizing the handicraft traditions and the virtues of hard work for which the region is known.

Bizau is part of the Bregenzerwald Umgang (literally &quot;Bregenzerwald Walking Tour&quot;). This walking tour offers insights into the architecture and community planning of 12 traditional villages in the Bregenzerwald. While walking over various landscapes, visiting public buildings, homes and everyday objects, walkers gain a comprehensive overview of typical Bregenzerwald architectural styles as they developed throughout the ages.

<doc id="1128998" wikidata="Q2836774" url="?curid=1128998" title="Alicia Masters">
<text>Alicia Reiss Masters is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, she first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #8 (November 1962). She is a supporting character to the superheroes the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer.

Alicia Masters is a blind sculptor. She is able to create incredibly lifelike representations of real people by touch and memory alone; her sculptures of the Fantastic Four and other superheroes are frequently depicted. A caring, sensitive character, she has been a romantic interest, confidante, and eventual wife of The Thing, a member of the Fantastic Four who is frequently ashamed of his monstrous appearance. She has also helped explain human life and emotion to the alien Silver Surfer.

Actress Kat Green played her in the unreleased &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; film from 1994, and then Kerry Washington portrayed her in the 2005 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and the 2007 sequel &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;.

== Publication history ==
Alicia Masters debuted in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #8 (November 1962), created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. She appeared in the 1987 Silver Surfer series, the 2018 &quot;Fantastic Four: Wedding Special&quot; #1 one-shot, and the 2023 &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==
Alicia Masters is introduced in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #8, along with her stepfather, the supervillain known as the Puppet Master. Alicia was not initially given a surname; she was given the last name &quot;Masters&quot; by a reader, as announced in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #42 (Sept. 1965); the reader was given a No-Prize for her service to Marvel. Alicia initially aids the Puppet Master out of obedience in his first scheme against the Fantastic Four, though she immediately senses the &quot;gentle&quot; and &quot;sensitive&quot; spirit of the Thing when she first feels his palpably monstrous face. Alicia turns on her stepfather when she realizes that he is mad and power-hungry, and accidentally causes him to fall to his apparent death out of a window. A subsequently published story explains that the Puppet Master had been responsible for her permanent blindness, which was caused by an explosion of radioactive clay during his fight with a rival.
Alicia Masters was a recurring character in early issues of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; as the love interest of the Thing, serving as a plot device to cause him to resist changing back to a normal human form, for fear that Alicia would not love him as &quot;plain Ben Grimm&quot;. The physically vulnerable Masters was also frequently used as a damsel in distress.

The character plays an integral role in one of the most acclaimed comic book stories of the Silver Age, &quot;The Coming of Galactus&quot;, in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #48–50 (March–May 1966). In that story arc, the Silver Surfer first comes to Earth as a herald to the powerful, world-destroying being Galactus, and crashes into Alicia&#x27;s apartment after fighting the Fantastic Four. Her passionate pleading with him about the value of life convinces him to reject his master and defend the Earth from destruction.

After the Thing chooses to remain on an alien planet where he could change back to human form, Alicia falls in love with the dashing Human Torch, another member of the Fantastic Four. The Thing returns to unhappily attend their wedding. In &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #300, Johnny Storm and Alicia have their wedding, but it is nearly foiled by the Mad Thinker, the Wizard, and Alicia&#x27;s stepfather, the Puppet Master. These three villains planned to attack the wedding, but at the last moment Puppet Master stopped them, with the (unwilling) help of Dragon Man.

After several months, the Fantastic Four discovers that Alicia was kidnapped and replaced by Lyja, a Skrull espionage agent sent to infiltrate the Fantastic Four and set them up for her handler, Paibok the Power Skrull, to destroy them. The Fantastic Four defeats Paibok and retrieves Alicia. She was taken before Ben broke up with her, and her feelings for Ben never changed. This makes things difficult for both him and Johnny. The two of them had months to resolve things between them. Now Johnny has to come to grips with the fact that the real Alicia never loved him and that Lyja is the woman he loves. Ben has to deal with having gotten over Alicia, only to have her back and in love with him.

The press is told that Alicia and Johnny divorced. With her relationships with Ben and Johnny now complicated by Johnny&#x27;s marriage to &#x27;Lyja&#x27; and Ben&#x27;s prior attempts to resolve his old feelings for her after Lyja&#x27;s marriage, Alicia subsequently becomes romantically involved with the Silver Surfer and eventually leaves Earth with him, traveling through outer space at his side in an armored suit.

Alicia is frequently trusted as a babysitter for Franklin Richards, the son of Invisible Woman and Mr. Fantastic. During the year-long period in which the FF were missing (&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;), Alicia is seen as his primary caretaker.

In a 2007 storyline set in the aftermath of an apparent assassination of Captain America, Alicia designed the memorial to him.

Following the events of the 2008 &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Alicia is made part of a support group for people replaced by the Skrulls, as she has firsthand knowledge of what it is like being replaced and then returned after a long period of time.

After the Fantastic Four have disbanded following the collapse of the multiverse, Peter Parker purchases the Baxter Building to keep it safe until the team are ready to come back together, including a statue of the FF in the entrance hall that was made by Alicia. Ben initially spends some time with the Guardians of the Galaxy, but eventually, after a failed attempt to find the Richards&#x27; family in the multiverse, he proposes to Alicia just before the Richards return to Earth. The two marry just as Galactus returns to Earth in Latveria, but Reed reveals that he has actually developed a pocket temporal generator that freezes time everywhere on Earth but a small bubble for four minutes, allowing the rabbi to complete the ceremony and marry Ben and Alicia before they depart to fight Galactus.

In the aftermath of the 2020 crossover “Empyre”, Ben and Alicia adopted two orphans, the Kree boy Jo-Venn and the Skrull girl N’Kala.

==Skills and abilities==
Alicia Masters possesses no superpowers. She is naturally empathetic and compassionate, with expertise in sculpting. Her cane is also designed to be used as a double baton for self-defense.

== Reception ==
Kai Young of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; stated the empathy Alicia Masters demonstrates makes the character a &quot;gentle presence&quot; among the Fantastic Four and complimented her relationship with Ben Grimm. David Harth of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; praised how Alicia Masters overlooks Ben Grimm&#x27;s appearance and values his true nature, calling their relationship a &quot;huge moment for every fan&quot;.

==Other versions==

=== &quot;Dark Avengers&quot; ===

He was made brigade commander, 31 and 15 Brigades from August 1975 to August 1978. In 1976, Idiagbon proceeded to the Command and Staff College in Quetta, Pakistan, for further military training. In July 1978 he was promoted to the rank of colonel. He was appointed as the director of manpower (manning) and planning, Army Headquarters in October 1979.

In May 1980 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. In 1981, he attended the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos, Plateau state, Nigeria and in 1982 he attended the International Defence Management Course, Naval Postgraduate School, US. He was the military secretary of the Nigerian Army from 1981 to 1983.

==Military administrator of Borno State==
From August 1978 to October 1979, the military Head of State, General Obasanjo appointed Idiagbon as the military administrator (position now called governor) of Borno State, Nigeria.

==Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters==
General Muhammadu Buhari made Idiagbon his second-in-command as Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters from 31 December 1983 to 27 August 1985. Described as a thorough military man, he played a key role as the hallmark of Buhari&#x27;s military government. Idiagbon was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1985.

He controlled all visible instruments of national, political, governmental and administrative powers. Idiagbon was responsible for introducing, announcing and implementing many of the government&#x27;s major policies, they include:

=== War Against Indiscipline ===

The five phases of the War Against Indiscipline which Idiagbon announced and implemented were:
* Phase One - Queuing, launched on 20 March 1984
* Phase Two - Work Ethics, launched on 1 May 1984
* Phase Three - Nationalism and Patriotism, launched on 21 August 1984
* Phase Four - Anti-Corruption and Economic Sabotage, launched on 14 May 1985
* Phase Five - Environmental Sanitation, launched on 29 July 1985

=== Currency change and currency exchange rate policy ===
In April 1984, Idiagbon announced the introduction of a new currency for Nigeria. He said the new currency would keep the same name, but the colors of bills would be different.

He also announced limits to currency exchange for corporations and individuals. The individual limit was $7,000. He said any corporation or individual exchanging in excess of the limit had to explain where the money came from and needed government clearance.

According to Idiagbon the major cause of the nation&#x27;s economic problems &quot;is the deliberate sabotage of the Nigerian currency through large-scale illegal trafficking of the currency&quot;.

=== Import substitution industrialisation policy ===
In 1984, Idiagbon implemented the military government&#x27;s import substitution industrialisation policy based on the use of local materials. Importation was tightened. The aim was to ensure the growth of local industries through the policy.

=== Go Back to Land Programme ===
Also in 1984, Idiagbon spearheaded and implemented the Go Back to Land Programme which was part of the government&#x27;s farming policy that encouraged massive agricultural food production and was also part of the military government&#x27;s poverty alleviation strategy.

=== Foreign policy ===
From January 1984 to August 1985, Idiagbon took control of all foreign policy matters that involved security. He was in control of the border closure, expulsion of illegal immigrants, and damage control after the Umaru Dikko Affair in Britain.

He also participated in diplomatic activities. On behalf of Nigeria&#x27;s military government, he signed credit line and educational cooperation agreements with a visiting Bulgarian delegation led by Prime Minister Grisha Filipov in 1984. He led a delegation in 1984 to the Soviet Union to meet Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko.
==1985 military coup d&#x27;état==
After 20 months in power, the military government of Buhari was overthrown by Ibrahim Babangida on 27 August 1985. Idiagbon was removed from his position as chief of staff, Supreme Headquarters, and he was placed under house arrest for three years, after his release he retired to his hometown Ilorin and lived in relative obscurity.

==Personal life==
On 6 March 1970, Idiagbon married Biodun Idiagbon (née Gamra). They had two sons and three daughters together: Adekunle, Junior, Ronke, Mope and Bola. On 24 March 1999, Idiagbon died under very suspicious circumstances.

==Awards==
Major-General Idiagbon (Rtd.) received several awards and medals. In alphabetical order they include:
* Defence Service Medal (DSM) 
* Forces Service Star (FSS) 
* General Service Medal (GSM) 
* National Service Medal (NSM)

<doc id="1129005" wikidata="Q2362228" url="?curid=1129005" title="Substantial equivalence">
<text>In food safety, the concept of substantial equivalence holds that the safety of a new food, particularly one that has been genetically modified (GM), may be assessed by comparing it with a similar traditional food that has proven safe in normal use over time. It was first formulated as a food safety policy in 1993, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

As part of a food safety testing process, substantial equivalence is the initial step, establishing toxicological and nutritional differences in the new food compared to a conventional counterpart—differences are analyzed and evaluated, and further testing may be conducted, leading to a final safety assessment.

Substantial equivalence is the underlying principle in GM food safety assessment for a number of national and international agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization.

==Origin==
The concept of comparing genetically modified foods to traditional foods as a basis for safety assessment was first introduced as a recommendation during the 1990 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on biotechnology and food safety (a scientific conference of officials and industry), although the term &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; was not used. Adopting the term, &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; was formulated as a food safety policy by the OECD, first described in their 1993 report, &quot;Safety Evaluation of Foods Derived by Modern Biotechnology: Concepts and Principles. 

The term was borrowed from the FDA&#x27;s 1976 substantial equivalence definition for new medical devices—under Premarket Notification 510(k), a new Class II device that is essentially similar to an existing device can be cleared for release without further testing. The underlying approach of comparing a new product or technique to an existing one has long been used in various fields of science and technology.

In June 1999, G8 leaders requested the OECD to “undertake a study on the implications of biotechnology and other aspects of food safety.” In 2000, the OECD Edinburgh Conference on Scientific and Health Aspects of Genetically Modified Foods was held. Following those discussions, the OECD published an opinion that substantial equivalence is an important tool in analyzing the safety of novel foods, including GM foods. The document noted that substantial equivalence serves as a framework for approaching food safety assessment, rather than functioning as a quantitative standard or measure.

==Description==
The OECD bases the substantial equivalence principle on a definition of food safety where we can assume that a food is safe for consumption if it has been eaten over time without evident harm. It recognizes that traditional foods may naturally contain toxic components (usually called antinutrients)—such as the glycoalkaloids solanine in potatoes and alpha-tomatine in tomatoes—which do not affect their safety when prepared and eaten in traditional ways.

The report proposes that, while biotechnology broadens the scope of food modification, it does not inherently introduce additional risk, and therefore, GM products may be assessed in the same way as conventionally bred products. Further, the relative precision of biotech methods should allow assessment to be focused on the most likely problem areas. The concept of substantial equivalence is then described as a comparison between a GM food and a similar conventional food, taking into account food processing, and how the food is normally consumed, including quantity, dietary patterns, and the characteristics of the consuming population.
==Assessment process==
Substantial equivalence is the starting point for GM food safety assessment: significant differences between a new food item and its conventional counterpart would indicate the need for further testing. A &quot;targeted approach&quot; is taken, by selecting specific relevant molecules for comparison. For plants, selection of a suitable comparator may involve growing the new plant side by side with genetically closely-related varieties, or using publicly available composition data for closely-related varieties.

Evaluation for substantial equivalence can be applied at different points in the food chain, from unprocessed harvested crop to final ingredient or product, depending on the nature of the food item and its intended use. 

For a GM plant, the overall evaluation process may be viewed in four phases:

# Substantial equivalence analysisConsidering introduced genes, newly expressed proteins, and new secondary metabolites
# Toxicological and nutritional analysis of detected differencesGene transfer, allergenicity, degradation characteristics, bioavailability, toxicity, and estimated intake levels
# Toxicological and nutritional evaluationIf necessary, additional toxicity testing, possibly including whole foods (return to Phase 2).
# Final safety assessment of GM plant
==Technological developments==
There has been discussion about applying new biochemical concepts and methods in evaluating substantial equivalence, such as metabolic profiling and protein profiling. These concepts refer, respectively, to the complete measured biochemical spectrum (total fingerprint) of compounds (metabolites) or of proteins present in a food or crop. The goal would be to compare overall the biochemical profile of a new food to an existing food to see if the new food&#x27;s profile falls within the range of natural variation already exhibited by the profile of existing foods or crops. However, these techniques are not considered sufficiently evaluated, and standards have not yet been developed, to apply them.

==Adoption==
Approaches to GM food regulation vary by country, while substantial equivalence is generally the underlying principle of GM food safety assessment. This is the case for national and international agencies that include the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization. In 1997, the European Union established a novel food assessment procedure whereby, once the producer has confirmed substantial equivalence with an existing food, government notification, with accompanying scientific evidence, is the only requirement for commercial release, however, foods containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are excluded and require mandatory authorization.

To establish substantial equivalence, the modified product is tested by the manufacturer for unexpected changes to a targeted set of components such as toxins, nutrients, or allergens, that are present in a similar unmodified food. The manufacturer&#x27;s data is then assessed by a regulatory agency. If regulators determine that there is no significant difference between the modified and unmodified products, then there will generally be no further requirement for food safety testing. However, if the product has no natural equivalent, or shows significant differences from the unmodified food, or for other reasons that regulators may have (for instance, if a gene produces a protein that has not been a food component before), further safety testing may be required.

==Issues==
There have been criticisms of the effectiveness of substantial equivalence.

<doc id="1129009" wikidata="Q1537343" url="?curid=1129009" title="Re-Animator">
<text>Re-Animator (also known as H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Re-Animator) is a 1985 American comedy horror film loosely based on the 1922 H. P. Lovecraft serial novelette &quot;Herbert West–Reanimator&quot;. Directed by Stuart Gordon and produced by Brian Yuzna, the film stars Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, a medical student who has invented a reagent which can re-animate deceased bodies. He and his classmate Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) begin to test the serum on dead human bodies, and conflict with Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale), who is infatuated with Cain&#x27;s fiancée (Barbara Crampton) and wants to claim the invention as his own.

Originally devised by Gordon as a theatrical stage production and later a half-hour television pilot, the television script was revised to become a feature film. Filmed in Hollywood, the film originally was released without a rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, and was later edited to obtain an R rating. It garnered its largest audience through the unrated cut&#x27;s release on home video.

&quot;Re-Animator&quot; is the first film collaboration between Gordon and Combs, the second being &quot;From Beyond&quot;, released in 1986. It is the first film in the &quot;Re-Animator&quot; film series, followed by &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; in 2003. Released to mostly positive reviews, &quot;Re-Animator&quot; has since been considered a cult film.

==Plot==
At the University of Zurich Institute of Medicine in Switzerland, Herbert West brings his dead professor, Dr. Hans Gruber, back to life. There are horrific side-effects, however; as West explains, the dosage was too large. When accused of killing Gruber, West counters: &quot;I gave him life!&quot;

West arrives at Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts in order to further his studies as a medical student. He rents a room from fellow medical student Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; Cain and converts the house&#x27;s basement into his own personal laboratory. West demonstrates his reanimating reagent to Dan by reanimating Dan&#x27;s dead cat Rufus. The cat behaves viciously that night, forcing Dan to kill it again before West reanimates what is left of it, convincing Dan that West&#x27;s reagent works. Dan&#x27;s fiancée Megan Halsey, daughter of the medical school&#x27;s dean, walks in on this experiment and is horrified.

Dan tries to tell the dean about West&#x27;s success in reanimating the dead cat, but the dean does not believe him. When Dan insists, the dean implies that Dan and West have gone mad. Barred from the school, West and Dan sneak into the morgue to test the reagent on a human subject in an attempt to prove that the reagent works, and thereby salvage their medical careers. The corpse they inject comes back to life, but in a frenetic and violent zombie-like state. Dr. Halsey stumbles upon the scene and is killed by the reanimated corpse, which West then kills with a bone-saw. Excited at the prospect of working with a freshly dead specimen, West injects Dr. Halsey&#x27;s body with his reanimating reagent. Dr. Halsey returns to life, also in a zombie-like state. Megan chances upon the scene, and is hysterical. Dan collapses in shock.

Dr. Halsey&#x27;s colleague Dr. Carl Hill, a professor and researcher at the hospital, takes charge of Dr. Halsey, whom he puts in a padded observation cell adjacent to his office. He carries out a surgical operation on him, lobotomizing him. During the course of this operation, he discovers that Dr. Halsey is not sick, but dead and reanimated.

Dr. Hill goes to West&#x27;s basement lab and attempts to blackmail him into surrendering his reagent and notes, hoping to take credit for West&#x27;s discovery. West offers to demonstrate the reagent and puts a few drops of it onto a microscope slide with dead cat tissue. As Dr. Hill peers through the microscope at this slide, West clobbers him from behind with a shovel, and then decapitates him with it. West then reanimates Dr. Hill&#x27;s head and body separately. While West is questioning Dr. Hill&#x27;s head and taking notes, Dr. Hill&#x27;s body sneaks up behind him and knocks him unconscious. The body carries the head back to Dr. Hill&#x27;s office, with West&#x27;s reagent and notes.

In his re-animated state, Dr. Hill acquires the ability to control other re-animated corpses telepathically, after conducting brain surgery on them. He then directs Dr. Halsey to snatch Megan away from Dan. While being carried to the morgue by her reanimated father, Megan faints. When she arrives, Dr. Hill strips her naked and straps her unconscious body to a table. She regains consciousness as Hill&#x27;s body and bloody, severed head begin to sexually assault her.

Hill&#x27;s body starts to place his head between Megan&#x27;s legs, but is interrupted by the arrival of West and Dan. West distracts Dr. Hill while Dan frees Megan. Dr. Hill reveals that he has reanimated and lobotomized several corpses from the morgue, rendering them susceptible to mind control as Halsey is. However, Megan&#x27;s voice reawakens a protectiveness in her father, who fights off the other corpses as Dan and Megan escape. In the ensuing chaos, West injects Dr. Hill&#x27;s body with a lethal overdose of the reagent. Dr. Hill&#x27;s body mutates rapidly and attacks West, who screams out to Dan to save his work before being pulled away by Dr. Hill&#x27;s monstrous entrails.

Dan retrieves the satchel containing West&#x27;s reagent and notes. As Dan and Megan flee the morgue, one of the reanimated corpses attacks and strangles Megan. Dan takes her to the hospital emergency room and tries to revive her, but she is dead. In despair, he injects her with West&#x27;s reagent. After the scene fades to black, Megan, apparently revived, can be heard screaming.

==Production==
The idea to make &quot;Re-Animator&quot; came from a discussion Stuart Gordon had with friends one night about vampire films. He felt that there were too many Dracula films and expressed a desire to see a Frankenstein film. Someone asked if he had read &quot;Herbert West–Reanimator&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft. Gordon had read most of the author&#x27;s works, but not that story, which was long out of print. He went to the Chicago Public Library and read their copy.

Originally, Gordon was going to adapt Lovecraft&#x27;s story for the stage, but eventually decided along with writers Dennis Paoli and William Norris to make it as a half-hour television pilot. The story was set around the turn of the century, and they soon realized that it would be too expensive to recreate. They updated it to the present day in Chicago with the intention of using actors from the Organic Theater company. They were told that the half hour format was not saleable and so they made it an hour, writing 13 episodes. Special effects technician Bob Greenberg, who had worked on John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Dark Star&quot;, repeatedly told Gordon that the only market for horror was in feature films, and introduced him to producer Brian Yuzna. Gordon showed Yuzna the script for the pilot and the 12 additional episodes. The producer liked what he read and convinced Gordon to shoot the film in Hollywood, because of all the special effects involved. Yuzna made a distribution deal with Charles Band&#x27;s Empire Pictures in return for post-production services. However, after viewing the initial dailies Empire became involved in the actual production, making a number of suggestions, including the recruitment of Mac Ahlberg as cinematographer.

According to Paoli, the first draft of the script contained no humor whatsoever, and the film&#x27;s comedic elements only came out over further revisions and during the actual production.

Yuzna described the film as having the &quot;sort of shock sensibility of an &quot;Evil Dead&quot; with the production values of, hopefully, &quot;The Howling&quot;.&quot; Gordon cited &quot;The Revenge of Frankenstein&quot; as a major inspiration for the film. John Naulin worked on the film&#x27;s gruesome makeup effects, using what he described as &quot;disgusting shots brought out from the Cook County morgue of all kinds of different lividities and different corpses.&quot; The morgue set was based on the aforementioned Cook County morgue, which was newly built and featured cutting-edge technology; Gordon opted for this look since he felt old morgues had been overdone in horror films. Naulin and Gordon also used a book of forensic pathology in order to present how a corpse looks once the blood settles in the body, creating a variety of odd skin tones. Naulin said that &quot;Re-Animator&quot; was the bloodiest film he had ever worked on: in the past, he had never used more than a couple of gallons (7.6liters) of blood on a film, but on &quot;Re-Animator&quot; he used twelve times as much.

Jeffrey Combs was cast as Herbert West. Combs had never read any H. P. Lovecraft before his casting and was taken aback by the script; he later said he only took the role because he needed the work and assumed the film would never reach a large audience.

Principal photography began on November 28, 1984, with a six-week shooting schedule, though Gordon has boasted that they finished shooting the film in just four weeks. The biggest makeup challenge in the film was the headless Dr. Hill zombie. Tony Doublin designed the mechanical effects and was faced with the problem of proportion once the 9–10 inches of the head were removed from the body. Each scene forced him to use a different technique. For example, one technique involved building an upper torso that actor David Gale could bend over and stick his head through so that it appeared to be the one that the walking corpse was carrying around.

The &quot;reanimating agent&quot; itself was the chemiluminescent agent luminol.

==Soundtrack==
The score for the film was composed by Richard Band, and has been noted for its similarities to Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Psycho&quot;. The score took about three and a half weeks to complete, and was recorded in Italy with the Rome Philharmonic. In regards to the influence of Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; score, Band has noted that the similarities were intentional, and that he &quot;used that as a base and modified the theme but kept that Herrmannesque feeling.&quot;

The film soundtrack was released by Waxwork Records on vinyl and includes liner notes by composer Richard Band and director Stuart Gordon, with album artwork by Gary Pullin.

==Release==
&quot;Re-Animator&quot; was released on October 18, 1985, in 129 theaters, and grossed $543,728 during its opening weekend. It went on to make $2,023,414 in North America, above its estimated $900,000 budget. However, it experienced its greatest commercial success when released on home video. The film was re-released with a premiere on May 21, 2010, as part of Creation Entertainment&#x27;s Weekends of Horror.

===Home video===
The film was originally released on VHS, LaserDisc and Betamax by Vestron Video, and was later released on DVD by Elite Entertainment on April 30, 2002 in two versions: a standard DVD edition, and a &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; featuring a remastered picture and two commentary tracks, one by writer/director Stuart Gordon and the other by the entire main cast except for David Gale, who died in 1991. This THX certified two-disc DVD release also comes with Dolby Digital 5.1 standard and isolated musical score audio tracks, a 2.0 mono audio track and a DTS 5.1 audio track.

===R-rated version===
When &quot;Re-Animator&quot; was originally released in theaters, the filmmakers did not submit it for rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), for fear that it would receive an X rating. However, this presented advertising restrictions, since many media outlets had policies against promoting unrated films. In early 1986, the filmmakers submitted a re-edited version of &quot;Re-Animator&quot; to the MPAA, which received an R rating. In the US, the vast majority of home media releases of the film used the unrated version.

The R-rated version runs 93 minutes and has much of the gore edited out and replaced with various scenes which had been deleted for pacing purposes, including a subplot involving Dr. Hill hypnotizing several of the characters to make them more suggestible to his will (in this version, Dean Halsey is hypnotized early on to turn him against West, and then later is hypnotized again after he has been re-animated; in the theatrical film, the re-animated Halsey&#x27;s submission is merely a result of the lobotomy). In addition, a short scene was added showing Herbert West injecting himself with small amounts of the reagent to stay awake and energized; this may have affected his thinking over the course of the film.

The unrated version is often labeled as a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;, which strictly speaking is false; director Stuart Gordon was not allowed to determine the final cut on any version of the film. However, Gordon has expressed his preference for the unrated version over the R-rated version.

===Integral cut===
A 2013 German Blu-ray release of &quot;Re-Animator&quot; also included a new &quot;Integral cut,&quot; wherein the extra material from the R-rated version was incorporated into the unrated version, expanding the film from 86 minutes to just under 105 minutes. This extended cut has also been included with other non-US releases.

==Reception==
The film was well received by critics, earning mostly positive reviews. Pauline Kael enjoyed the film&#x27;s &quot;indigenous American junkiness&quot; and called it &quot;pop Buñuel; the jokes hit you in a subterranean comic zone that the surrealists&#x27; pranks sometimes reached, but without the surrealists&#x27; self-consciousness (and art-consciousness).&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, &quot;I walked out somewhat surprised and reinvigorated (if not re-animated) by a movie that had the audience emitting taxi whistles and wild goat cries.&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;&quot;Re-Animator&quot; has a fast pace and a good deal of grisly vitality. It even has a sense of humor, albeit one that would be lost on 99.9 percent of any ordinary moviegoing crowd&quot;.

Paul Attanasio, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, praised Jeffrey Combs&#x27; performance: &quot;Beady-eyed, his face hard, almost lacquered, Combs makes West into a brittle, slightly fey psychotic in the Anthony Perkins mold. West is a figure of fun, but Combs doesn&#x27;t spoof him.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kevin Thomas wrote, &quot;The big noise is Combs, a small, compact man of terrific intensity and concentration.&quot; David Edelstein, writing for &quot;Village Voice&quot;, placed the film in his year-end Top Ten Movies list.

In their book &quot;Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft&quot;, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: &quot;&quot;Re-Animator&quot; took First Prize at the Paris Festival of Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Horror, a Special Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and even spawned a short-lived series of comic books. Even though it was a hit with audiences, the film generated a huge amount of controversy among Lovecraft readers. Fans thought the film a desecration of Lovecraft; their literary hero would never write such obvious exploitation! But the final criticism of the film might have been a bit more muted if these fans had actually read the &#x27;West&#x27; stories, which are pure exploitation. Lovecraft himself acknowledged as much, and female love interest and black sex humor aside, &quot;Re-Animator&quot; really is one of the more faithful and effective adaptations.&quot; Bruce C. Hallenbeck, in his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008&quot;, said the film was one of the few to successfully combine genuine scares with genuine laughs, and praised Combs&#x27;s performance as retaining the theatricality of classic horror stars. He remarked that &quot;&quot;Re-Animator&quot; broke down the barriers between &#x27;splatter movies&#x27; and comedy-horror films. Its buckets of gore mixed with barrels of laughs, and it opened up a whole new realm where nothing was sacred and nothing was taboo.&quot;

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 62 reviews and gave the film an approval rating of 94%, with an average rating of 7.81/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Perfectly mixing humor and horror, the only thing more effective than &quot;Re-Animator&quot;″s gory scares are its dry, deadpan jokes.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a rating of 73 out of 100 based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film number 32 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films,&quot; and number 14 on their &quot;The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since &#x27;83&quot; list.

==Legacy==
&quot;Re-Animator&quot; was followed by two sequels: &quot;Bride of Re-Animator&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; in 2003. &quot;Re-Animator&quot; director Stuart Gordon directed another film based on an H. P. Lovecraft story, &quot;From Beyond&quot; (1986); though it featured a story unrelated to &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, it also starred both Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton.

In the book &quot;Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft&quot;, producer-director Brian Yuzna mentions an idea that he had for a fourth &quot;Re-Animator&quot;. This version would have been titled &quot;Island of Re-Animator&quot;, and would have been strongly influenced by the H. G. Wells novel &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;.

In the 1999 film &quot;American Beauty&quot;, Kevin Spacey and Wes Bentley&#x27;s characters Lester Burnham and Ricky Fitts make mention of the film: while both are high on marijuana, Lester asks Ricky, &quot;Did you ever see that movie where the body is walking around carrying its own head and then the head goes down on that babe?&quot; They both laugh and Ricky replies, &quot;Re-Animator.&quot;

In 2011, a musical adaptation opened in New York, which director Gordon participated in.

In 1991, Adventure Comics released three officially licensed comic books based on the 1985 film. These included &quot;Re-Animator In Full Color&quot; #1-3 (an adaptation of the film), a one-shot entitled &quot;Re-Animator: Tales of Herbert West&quot; (which reprinted H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s original novelette), and a four issue series titled &quot;Re-Animator: Dawn of The Re-Animator&quot;, a prequel series set in the middle of the 1985 film&#x27;s prologue scenes. In 2008, the version of Herbert West from the three &quot;Re-Animator&quot; films appeared in an officially licensed crossover with Tim Seeley&#x27;s creator-owned comic &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; #15-17 (set several years after the events of the &quot;Beyond Re-Animator&quot; film) published by Image Comics. Following the release of &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; #15, Brian Yuzna and Image Comics were sent a cease and desist letter from a company called ReAnimator LLC (owned by Nick Barucci, the president of comic publisher Dynamite Entertainment) claiming that they owned the trademark to &quot;Re-Animator&quot; and the Herbert West character for comic book publications. While ReAnimator LLC&#x27;s notice did not have any true legal standing, &quot;Hack/Slash&quot; #16 and #17 were delayed, and removed the logo of the 1985 film from the cover. Dynamite Entertainment and Brian Yuzna would settle their trademark dispute out of court in 2013, with Yuzna dropping his lawsuit under the agreement that Dynamite would no longer use imagery or the likeness of any characters from the films. Following this agreement, Dynamite Entertainment has continued using a close approximation of the likeness of actor Jeffery Combs for their comics featuring the Herbert West character, though none of their titles published before or since are connected to the 1985 film or its sequels.

<text>Jenő Huszka (a.k.a. ; 24 April 1875, Szeged – 2 February 1960, Budapest) was a Hungarian composer of operettas.

== Life ==
At the age of 5, he had his first performance – nicely played violin. He studied composition at the Academy of Music (&quot;Zeneakadémia&quot;) in Budapest. As a young man (in 1896) he was a member of the Lamoureux Orchestra in Paris. He also had to study law (this was the wish of his parents). After finishing his studies, he worked in the Ministry of Education in Budapest, in the department of art. His friend Ferenc Martos (1875–1938), a distinguished Hungarian librettist, worked in the same department and wrote all the librettos for his operettas.

The music of Jenő Huszka is considered fresh, sweet and romantic. It is inspired by Hungarian folk music and the waltzes of Vienna.

<text>M.A.C.H. 1 was a comic strip that ran in the British science fiction comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;. The strip was created by writer Pat Mills and illustrator Enio. It debuted in the first issue of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, which was published in February 1977, and ran nearly continuously until issue 64, dated 13 May 1978.

==Development==
Pat Mills has said the idea was a deliberate ripoff of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; after kids said they wanted to see that in a comic, and the concept of a computer brain as a partner was taken by John Wagner from Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Deathlok&quot;. The name came from Doug Church while Mills, according to Church, came up with the acronym on the spot.

==Premise==
Initially, &quot;M.A.C.H. 1&quot; (&quot;M.A.C.H.&quot; stands for &quot;Man Activated by Compu-puncture Hyperpower&quot;) thematically resembled &quot;the Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, but with more graphic violence. As the strip continued the tone became increasingly dark. This contrasted directly with &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, who began as a killer, but was progressively softened by the TV networks until it fitted into family entertainment.

===Plot===
John Probe is a British Secret Service agent at first engaging in missions against Communists, terrorists and organised crime. He has been given extreme physical enhancement by a method known as &quot;compu-puncture&quot; to give him &quot;hyperpower&quot; equivalent to the strength of fifty men, and computer circuitry imprinted onto his skull to control and advise on use of the hyperpower. The computer also grants him occasional mental skills, such as how to pilot aeroplanes, drive an armoured car, or specific scientific and military knowledge he would not normally possess. Probe eventually discovers that his superior, Denis Sharpe, had engineered the compu-puncture treatment which had given him his abilities so as to erase Probe&#x27;s pre-augmented memory and to cause his death if he did not receive frequent treatments. As a result, Probe was forced to work for Sharpe.

Probe attempted to leave Sharpe and the service several times, but was forced to return for controlling hyperpower injections to prevent his energy flow from falling below survival level - although one story suggests that he has left Sharpe for an unspecified but considerable length of time. Probe&#x27;s computer would often attempt to overrule or counter his human emotions, but as the story wore on Probe became more and more resentful to both the computer and Sharpe&#x27;s orders, often disobeying the computer&#x27;s advice completely. Eventually, M.A.C.H. 1 killed Sharpe and then sacrificed himself to enable aliens, provoked into attacking Earth by Sharpe, to return home. Probe&#x27;s life before his compu-puncture treatment was never clarified or explained, and it was stated several times that the only person who knew anything about his prior life was Sharpe himself.

==Characters==
* John Probe: A British Secret Service agent who volunteered for a special procedure whereby his physical strength, speed and agility would be enhanced using &#x27;compu-puncture&#x27;, a computerized form of acupuncture using multiple &#x27;electro-needles&#x27;. His metabolism was controlled by a computer implanted in his skull, which also fed him tactical information such as the amount of strength or the exact throwing angle required for a given task.
* M.A.C.H. Zero: M.A.C.H. 1 later met M.A.C.H. Zero, a prototype agent who had not been equipped with a computer implant and had consequently been driven insane by the uncontrolled hyperpower. M.A.C.H. Zero later appeared in his own strip, involving a search for his son Tommy, based on a case of mistaken identity
* Tanya Maski, an East European M.A.C.H. agent created after Sharpe sold the compu-puncture techniques to the Soviets. Maski had been created using inferior technology and although she possessed similar hyperpower to M.A.C.H. 1 would burn out much sooner. Aware of this, she sacrificed herself to allow M.A.C.H. 1 to escape and confront Sharpe over his involvement.
* M.A.C.H. 2 a robot successor to M.A.C.H. 1, created by Sharpe in order to remove the human element and perceived limitations from the M.A.C.H. project. M.A.C.H. 1 fought M.A.C.H. 2, and was beaten, but managed to severely damage M.A.C.H. 2 during the fight. Sharpe prevented M.A.C.H. 2 from killing M.A.C.H. 1, recognising that the human element - which was what enabled M.A.C.H. 1 to damage M.A.C.H. 2 - may still have use.

==Publications==
Both &quot;M.A.C.H. 1&quot; and &quot;M.A.C.H. Zero&quot; appeared in their own eponymous series. &quot;M.A.C.H. 1&quot; and &quot;M.A.C.H. Zero&quot; were later reprinted in &quot;Eagle&quot;, and &quot;M.A.C.H. 1&quot; was also in anthology format (the beginning and end in &quot;2000AD Extreme Edition&quot; #6 and #9).

==Parodies==
===B.L.A.I.R. 1===

A spoof, entitled &quot;B.L.A.I.R. 1&quot;, a satire on Tony Blair, appeared in &quot;2000 AD&quot; in the late 1990s, and gained considerable media attention at the time. The story was not popular with readers, however, and was soon killed off.

* &quot;B.L.A.I.R. 1&quot; (with art from Simon Davis):
** &quot;B.L.A.I.R. 1&quot; (with David Bishop/Steve MacManus, in &quot;2000 AD&quot; #1034, 1997)
** &quot;Blair Force One&quot; (with Alan Grant, in &quot;2000 AD&quot; #1071-1074, 1997)
** &quot;Criminal Record&quot; (with Alan Grant, in &quot;2000 AD&quot; #1084, 1998)
** &quot;He Died with his Boots on&quot; (with Alan Grant, in &quot;2000 AD&quot; #1097-1098, 1998)

===Z.O.M.B.O.===
A second spoof ran in the 40th Anniversary Special: a fake &#x27;original&#x27; version of the strip &quot;Zombo&quot;, dropped from the comic&#x27;s original line-up. &quot;Z.O.M.B.O.&quot; parodied &quot;M.A.C.H. 1&quot;, &quot;Invasion!&quot;, and other British 1970s strip tropes with an over-the-top working class Zombo (playing the John Probe role) paired with an upper-class Etonian.

<doc id="1129020" wikidata="Q7118259" url="?curid=1129020" title="PASS device">
<text>A PASS device (personal alert safety system), also known as a distress signal unit (DSU) or ADSU (automatic distress signal unit), is a personal safety device used primarily by firefighters entering a hazardous or &quot;immediately dangerous to life and health&quot; (IDLH) environment such as a burning building. The PASS device sounds a loud (95 decibel) audible alert to notify others in the area that the firefighter is in distress. On a fireground, the sound of an activated PASS device indicates a true emergency and results in an immediate response to rescue the firefighters in distress. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association sets standards for PASS devices in NFPA 1982.

The PASS device is normally used in conjunction with breathing apparatus; it is a small, battery-powered device attached to the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) harness which enables the firefighter to summon help by activating a loud, piercing electronic bleeper.

Early models were only able to be activated manually, such as when a firefighter is lost or trapped. More recent PASS devices can also automatically activate if the device does not detect motion for 30 seconds, so that the alert will sound if the firefighter is seriously injured or otherwise incapacitated. Some devices use a ball bearing on a track to sense firefighter movement and others use an infrared beam against a mirror mounted on a spring. When activating for a lack of motion, the PASS device will typically emit a few seconds of a muted warning that activation is about to occur, so that a firefighter who has simply been motionless for a time but is otherwise safe will be able to move slightly and thus reset the activation timer before a false activation occurs.

Older models of PASS devices required manual arming by firefighters prior to entering a dangerous environment. The unit was equipped with a key which, when removed, armed the unit. This key was left outside the hazard area with an entry control officer. When the unit activated, it could only be switched off by inserting this key. Current applications integrate the PASS device into the SCBA worn by firefighters so that it automatically arms when the SCBA air supply is engaged or when the SCBA is removed from its mounting bracket. This style devices are powered by battery, are easily activated while wearing gloves, and are intrinsically safe to operate in flammable or explosive atmospheres.

It was reported that shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, the sound of many activated PASS devices could be heard beneath the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center. 343 firefighters (including a chaplain and two paramedics) of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) were killed on that day.

<doc id="1129026" wikidata="Q626719" url="?curid=1129026" title="Hyperon">
<text>In particle physics, a hyperon is any baryon containing one or more strange quarks, but no charm, bottom, or top quarks. This form of matter may exist in a stable form within the core of some neutron stars. Hyperons are sometimes generically represented by the symbol Y.

== History and research ==
The first research into hyperons happened in the 1950s and spurred physicists on to the creation of an organized classification of particles.

The term was coined by French physicist Louis Leprince-Ringuet in 1953, and announced for the first time at the cosmic ray conference at Bagnères de Bigorre in July of that year, agreed upon by Leprince-Ringuet, Bruno Rossi, C.F. Powell, William B. Fretter and Bernard Peters.

Today, research in this area is carried out on data taken at many facilities around the world, including CERN, Fermilab, SLAC, JLAB, Brookhaven National Laboratory, KEK, GSI and others. Physics topics include searches for CP violation, measurements of spin, studies of excited states (commonly referred to as &quot;spectroscopy&quot;), and hunts for exotic forms such as pentaquarks and dibaryons.

==Properties and behavior ==

Being baryons, all hyperons are fermions. That is, they have half-integer spin and obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. Hyperons all interact via the strong nuclear force, making them types of hadron. They are composed of three light quarks, at least one of which is a strange quark, which makes them strange baryons.

Excited hyperon resonances and ground-state hyperons with a &#x27;*&#x27; included in their notation decay via the strong interaction. For Ω⁻ as well as the lighter hyperons this decay mode is not possible given the particle masses and the conservation of flavor and isospin necessary in strong interactions. Instead, these decay weakly with non-conserved parity. An exception to this is the Σ⁰ which decays electromagnetically into Λ on account of carrying the same flavor quantum numbers. The type of interaction through which these decays occur determine the average lifetime, which is why weakly decaying hyperons are significantly more long-lived than those that decay through strong or electromagnetic interactions.

==List==
Notes:
* Since strangeness is conserved by the strong interactions, some ground-state hyperons cannot decay strongly. However, they do participate in strong interactions.
* may also decay on rare occurrences via these processes:
*: → + + 
* and are also known as &quot;cascade&quot; hyperons, since they go through a two-step cascading decay into a nucleon.
* The has a baryon number of +1 and hypercharge of −2, giving it strangeness of −3. It takes multiple flavor-changing weak decays for it to decay into a proton or neutron. Murray Gell-Mann&#x27;s and Yuval Ne&#x27;eman&#x27;s SU(3) model (sometimes called the Eightfold Way) predicted this hyperon&#x27;s existence, mass and that it will only undergo weak decay processes. Experimental evidence for its existence was discovered in 1964 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Further examples of its formation and observation using particle accelerators confirmed the SU(3) model.

The city spans areas of the Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts in the Indian state of West Bengal. Known as the &quot;Gateway of Northeast India&quot;, Siliguri is popular for three Ts: Tea, Timber and Tourism. It is located on the banks of the Mahananda in the foothills of the Himalayas. Siliguri is the third largest urban agglomeration in West Bengal, after Kolkata and Asansol.

==History==
===Etymology===
According to Sailen Debnath, &quot;Siliguri&quot; means a stack of pebbles or stones. Until the 19th century this region was called as &quot;Shilchaguri&quot; when there was dense Dolka forest covering the region. 

===Modern history===
Siliguri was a small agricultural village in the Kingdom of Sikkim. It was captured by the Kingdom of Nepal in 1788, after which Kirati and Lepchas came to settle in this region.

At that time a river port on Mahananda, South of Siliguri in Phansidewa had an important role in having trade bond with Malda, Bengal and Bihar. This riverine trade line was thus used by the Bhutanese and Sikkimese to bring goods into their mainland.

Siliguri started as a small area in the northern part of city, on the front of Mahananda River, which is now Dagapur. The Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospects of Siliguri, and it became a point of transit for the Darjeeling hills and Nepal mainland. From 1816 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic location in trade routes. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling and the entire Dooars region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. To scale up exportation they introduced the Siliguri Town railway station which stands to this day, and introduced the Toy train from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri gain sub-divisional town status in 1907.
The Siliguri Corridor was formed when Bengal was divided into West Bengal and East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975. At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better infrastructure, which led to an increased population. Later in 1950 Siliguri achieved municipal status. Keeping in mind the importance of Siliguri, in 1951, the Assam rail link was established with newly made (1949) Meter gauge Siliguri Junction railway station. After few years in 1961 all these stations were connected with broad gauge New Jalpaiguri Junction railway station which later became the most important railway station in Northeast India.

Due to tremendous growth, Siliguri is now far away from its past outlook, becoming the largest and fastest growing city in eastern India after Guwahati. The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981. Considering this growth, Siliguri came under the Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri population growth rate rose to 46.8% of 1981–1991. A treaty between India and China for trade through Nathu La Pass, has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri. Siliguri has now achieved the status of becoming the third-largest city in West Bengal, after Kolkata and Asansol.

<text>Baroness Lili (&quot;Lili bárónő&quot;) is an operetta by Jenő Huszka in three acts. It premiered in Budapest on 7 March 1919 in the Erkel Theatre. The libretto was by Ferenc Martos. It was popular in Hungary, especially in the 1980s.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
Baron Malomszegi bought an old castle from Count Illésházy. Upon arrival, he and his daughter Lili meet the count for the first time and believe him to be a Chamberlain. The latter does not reveal who he really is because of the opportunity of being close to the pretty young girl as a member of the castle&#x27;s staff.

===Act II===
Illésházy falls in love with Lili and enters into a closer relationship with her than a member of the staff normally would. However, neither Frédi, Lili&#x27;s fiancé, nor Clarisse, Illésházy&#x27;s old love, like this situation. Clarisse takes revenge on Illésházy and tells Lili that he is not a chamberlain, but the former owner of the castle. Thus, Illésházy has to leave the castle and Lili decides to marry Frédi.

===Act III===
Some months later, there is a horse race. The favourite is Tündér, Lili&#x27;s horse. However, her rider, Baron Sanci, arrives late. Illésházy steps in to ride in his place and wins the race. He meets Lili again and convinces her that he loves her.

===Arias===
The best known arias are 
* &quot;Cigaretta-keringő&quot; (Cigarette Waltz) 
* &quot;Egy férfi képe&quot; (The face of a man), a love song

<text>The Barron Knights are a British humorous pop rock group, originally formed in 1959 in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, as the Knights of the Round Table.

==Career==
They started out as a straight pop group, and they spent a couple of years touring and playing in English dance halls before making their way to Hamburg, Germany. Bill Wyman, later of the Rolling Stones, has written that the Barron Knights were the first group he saw with an electric bass, at a performance in Aylesbury in July 1961, inspiring him to take up the instrument. In 1963, at the invitation of Brian Epstein, they were one of the support acts on The Beatles&#x27; Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Astoria in London, and later became one of the few acts to tour with both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Their debut single was &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; / &quot;Never Miss Chris&quot; released in 1962 by Fontana Records (H.368). They also made their debut on BBC Television in this year performing on the children&#x27;s programme Let&#x27;s Go! 

For studio recordings they often brought in additional session musicians as required, including in 1968 a then unknown Reg Dwight (later known as Elton John).

They first came to fame in 1964 with the number &quot;Call Up the Groups&quot; (Parts 1 and 2). It overcame copyright restrictions and parodied a number of the leading pop groups of the time including the Searchers, Freddie and the Dreamers, the Dave Clark Five, the Bachelors, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. The song imagined the various artists singing about being conscripted, or &quot;called up&quot; into the British Army, although actual conscription had ended in 1960. The single climbed to number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. As an example, the song &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; by The Dave Clark Five was parodied as &quot;Boots and Blisters&quot;. They then followed this parody theme with two more hit singles &quot;Pop Go the Workers&quot; (1965) and &quot;Merry Gentle Pops&quot; (1966), while continuing to work the cabaret circuit, as they do internationally to this day.

In 1967, the group released the single &quot;Lazy Fat People&quot;, a satirical song written by Pete Townshend of The Who. In 1974 they toured South Africa with Petula Clark. By 1977 CBS Records had signed the group, bringing a resurgence in popularity, with &quot;Live in Trouble&quot; reaching number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. It was their first hit for over nine years. &quot;Angelo&quot; was just one song parodied on &quot;Live in Trouble&quot;, the others being &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot;, and &quot;Float On&quot;. Their 1978 release &quot;A Taste of Aggro&quot;, which parodied &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot;, &quot;Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs&quot; and &quot;The Smurf Song&quot;, became the group&#x27;s biggest hit with sales of over one million, reaching number 3 in the UK chart.

They achieved four other UK hit singles in the 1960s and 1970s but their only US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charted single, &quot;The Topical Song&quot;, was another comedic parody written by the American poet Robert Spring White. Based upon Supertramp&#x27;s &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, White, who also took the 1980 American Song Festival award in the folk category for &quot;Where Does The River Go&quot;, confined his humorous lyric compositions to the Barron Knights.

The group also produced Christmas specials on Channel 4 Television in 1983 and 1984 which continued to be repeated throughout the decade, a mix of sketches and songs with a comedy backbone for which the group brought in comedy writer Barry Faulkner (Grumbleweeds, Tom O&#x27;Connor, Week Ending, Russ Abbot&#x27;s Madhouse) to write sketches and links. In 1986, they sang a parody of the Jimmy Dean song &quot;Big Bad John&quot;, called &quot;Big Bad Bond&quot;. It was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond and his involvement in Australia&#x27;s victory in the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup. The single was released by WEA, and had &quot;The Loan Arranger&quot; on the B-side, both taken from their album &quot;California Girls&quot;.

, the group continued to perform for a worldwide audience, with a line-up featuring only Pete Langford from the original band members. Founding member Barron Antony retired on 5 October 1985, and fellow founding member Butch Baker retired in January 2007, being replaced by Len Crawley. The Barron Knights&#x27; original lead singer, Duke D&#x27;Mond, died on 9 April 2009.

<doc id="1129041" wikidata="Q128730" url="?curid=1129041" title="Thirteen Days (film)">
<text>Thirteen Days is a 2000 American historical political thriller film directed by Roger Donaldson. It dramatizes the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, seen from the perspective of the US political leadership. Kevin Costner stars as top White House assistant Kenneth P. O&#x27;Donnell, with Bruce Greenwood featured as President John F. Kennedy, Steven Culp as Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and Dylan Baker as Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.

While the film carries the same title as the 1969 book &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; by former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, it is in fact based on the 1997 book, &quot;The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis&quot;, by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow. It is the second docudrama made about the crisis, the first being 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Missiles of October&quot;, which was based on Kennedy&#x27;s book. The 2000 film contains some newly declassified information not available to the earlier production, but takes greater dramatic license, particularly in its choice of O&#x27;Donnell as protagonist. It received generally positive reviews from critics who praised the screenplay and performances of the cast but was a box-office bomb, grossing $66.6 million against its $80 million budget.

==Plot==
In October 1962, U-2 aerial surveillance photos reveal that the Soviet Union is placing intermediate-range ballistic missiles carrying nuclear weapons in Cuba. U.S. President John F. Kennedy and his advisers must come up with a plan to prevent their activation. Kennedy wants to show that the United States will not allow a missile threat. The Joint Chiefs of Staff advise military strikes against the missile sites followed by an invasion of Cuba. Kennedy is reluctant to this because it would likely cause the Soviets to invade West Berlin, which could lead to an all-out war. Kennedy sees an analogy to the events that started World War I, where the tactics of both sides&#x27; commanders had not evolved since the previous war and were obsolete, only this time nuclear weapons are involved. War appears to be almost inevitable.

The Kennedy administration tries to find a solution that will remove the missiles but avoid an act of war. They reject a blockade, as this is formally regarded as an act of war, and settle on what they publicly describe as a quarantine. They announce that the U.S. naval forces will stop all ships entering Cuban waters and inspect them to verify they are not carrying weapons. The Soviet Union sends mixed messages in response. Off the shores of Cuba, the Soviet ships turn back from the quarantine lines. Spy plane pictures continue to be ordered, but one of Kennedy&#x27;s top advisers, Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell, calls the pilots to ensure they do not report that they were shot at or fired upon, because if they were, the country would be forced to retaliate under the rules of engagement.

John A. Scali, a reporter with ABC News, is contacted by Soviet &quot;emissary&quot; Aleksandr Fomin, and through this back-channel communication method the Soviets offer to remove the missiles in exchange for public assurances that the U.S. will never invade Cuba. A long message in the same tone as the informal communication from Fomin, apparently written personally by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, is received. This is followed by a second, more hard line cable in which the Soviets offer a deal involving U.S removal of its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. The Kennedy administration interprets the second as a response from the Soviet Politburo, and decides to ignore it and respond to the message assumed to be from Khrushchev. There are several mis-steps during the crisis: the defense readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) is raised to DEFCON 2 (one step shy of maximum readiness for imminent war), without informing Kennedy; a U.S. nuclear weapon test proceeds (Bluegill Triple Prime) and a routine test launch of a U.S. offensive missile is also carried out without the President&#x27;s knowledge.

In a bid for time while under pressure from the military for an immediate strike, President Kennedy authorizes attacks on the missile sites and an invasion of Cuba, to commence the following Monday. An Air Force U-2 reconnaissance plane is sent over Cuba to gather intelligence for the attack, but is shot down, killing the pilot. After much deliberation with the Executive Committee of the National Security Council, Kennedy makes a final attempt to avoid a war by sending his brother Robert to meet with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin on Friday night. Bobby reiterates the demand that the Soviets remove their missiles from Cuba, and in return promises not to invade or assist in the invasion of Cuba. Dobrynin insists that the U.S. must also remove all Jupiter missiles from Turkey, on the border of the Soviet Union. Bobby says that a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; is not possible, but in exchange for Khrushchev removing the missiles from Cuba, there will be a secret understanding that the U.S. will remove all of its &quot;obsolete&quot; missiles from Turkey within six months as part of a pre-scheduled plan. The Soviets announce on Sunday that they will remove their missiles from Cuba, averting a war that could have escalated to the use of nuclear weapons. President Kennedy later dictates a letter of condolence to the family of the reconnaissance pilot, Rudolf Anderson, who was shot down over Cuba as part of the preparations for the invasion.

==Production==
The film was co-produced by several studios, including New Line Cinema, Kevin Costner&#x27;s Tig Productions and Armyan Bernstein&#x27;s Beacon Pictures.

The Department of Defense co-operated to some extent by allowing the producers to film on several bases. To keep the film &quot;in period,&quot; filming took place on ships from the time of the crisis that still existed in the active fleet () and ships that are preserved as museums (). Aircraft (both a preserved F-8 Crusader and Lockheed U-2 spyplane were featured) that still exist from the period were refurbished to appear operational as well. The RF-8 Crusader (and an F-5) and the scenes of Cuba were shot in the Philippines. The air base scene was taken at Clark Air Base, Philippines, a former American facility, which substituted for NAS Key West, Florida, where the actual RF-8As of Light Photographic Squadron SIX TWO (VFP-62) launched from on their Cuban overflight missions. At the time of the shooting, the F-8 was still in the inventory of the Philippine Air Force but was no longer operational. The F-5 was retired in 2005.

The Department of Defense attempted to get the film to change its portrayal of the US military, which they believed portrayed it in a negative light. When the producers refused military assistance was denied.

==Distribution==
The film was released in the United States by New Line Cinema, with Canadian distribution handled by Alliance Atlantis. Buena Vista International&#x27;s Buena Vista Film Sales handled the international sales of the film, with BVI self-distributing in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was given a limited theatrical release on Christmas Day 2000, and a wide release on January 12, 2001, with a staggered release to various countries throughout most of the year. The film grossed $66,579,890 worldwide against a production budget of $80 million.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 124 critics have given the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Thirteen Days&quot; offers a compelling look at the Cuban Missile Crisis, and its talented cast deftly portrays the real-life people who were involved.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream film critics, gives &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; a score of 67, based on 31 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; a rating of 3 stars out of 4, and said &quot;The movie&#x27;s taut, flat style is appropriate for a story that is more about facts and speculation than about action. Kennedy and his advisers study high-altitude photos and intelligence reports, and wonder if Khrushchev&#x27;s word can be trusted. Everything depends on what they decide. The movie shows men in unknotted ties and shirt-sleeves, grasping coffee cups or whiskey glasses and trying to sound rational while they are at some level terrified...[T]hings might not have happened exactly like this, but it sure did feel like they did.&quot;

===Political response===
Some former Kennedy administration officials and contemporary historians, including Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Special Counsel Ted Sorensen, and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, criticized the film for the depiction of Special Assistant Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell as chief motivator of Kennedy and others during the crisis. Prior to seeing the movie, McNamara reacted to the premise in a &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; interview: &quot;For God&#x27;s sakes, Kenny O&#x27;Donnell didn&#x27;t have any role whatsoever in the missile crisis; he was a political appointment secretary to the President; that&#x27;s absurd&quot;.

According to McNamara, the duties performed by O&#x27;Donnell in the film were closer to the role Sorensen played during the actual crisis: &quot;It was not Kenny O&#x27;Donnell who pulled us all together—it was Ted Sorensen.&quot; After seeing the movie McNamara remarked that while he still thought the filmmakers took some creative liberties with certain characters, he ultimately thought that it was a reasonable historical portrayal of the crisis: &quot;I think it&#x27;s an absolutely fascinating portrayal and a very constructive and responsible portrayal of a very, very serious crisis not only in the history of this nation but in the history of the world&quot;.

Kenny O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s son, the venture capitalist Kevin O&#x27;Donnell, bought back controlling interest in the production company Beacon Pictures in 1999 alongside earlier founder Armyan Bernstein. Kevin and Beacon Pictures have denied any undue influence on the screenplay portrayals of the released &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; the next year.

Costner traveled to Cuba in 2001 to screen the film for Fidel Castro, saying at a press conference, &quot;It was an experience of a lifetime to sit only a few feet away from him and watch him relive an experience he lived as a very young man.&quot;

<doc id="1129048" wikidata="Q5001038" url="?curid=1129048" title="Burwash">
<text>Burwash, archaically known as Burghersh, is a rural village and civil parish in the Rother district of East Sussex, England. Situated in the High Weald of Sussex some 15 miles (24 km) inland from the port of Hastings, it is located five miles (8 km) south-west of Hurst Green, on the A265 road, and on the River Dudwell, a tributary of the River Rother. In an area steeped in history, some nine miles (14 km) to the south-east lies Battle Abbey and eight miles (13 km) to the east is Bodiam Castle.

Its main claim to fame is that for half of his life Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) lived in the village at Bateman&#x27;s. Kipling used the house&#x27;s setting and the wider local area as the setting for many of his stories in &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; (1906) and the sequel &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; (1910), and there is a Kipling room at &quot;The Bear&quot; public house, one of two pubs located along Burwash High Street. Rudyard&#x27;s son, John Kipling, died during the First World War and is named on the village war memorial at the end of Bell Alley Lane. He was named after Rudyard&#x27;s father, the artist John Lockwood Kipling, (1837–1911), who provided illustrations for &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. A complete collection of Kipling&#x27;s works, including &quot;Just So Stories&quot;, &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; and &quot;Kim&quot;, was published as the &quot;Burwash Edition&quot; (1941).

==History==

The village developed as a trading place when King Henry III authorised a weekly market in 1252. He also allowed a three-day fair in May. Smuggling took place in the 18th and 19th centuries, and several smugglers&#x27; graves can still be seen in the churchyard of St Bartholomew&#x27;s.

The main road through Burwash, today&#x27;s A265, was improved in the 18th and 19th centuries after it came under the administration of the Ringmer and Hurst Green turnpike trust. The trust was formed in 1765 after fifteen petitions were presented to parliament on 25 December 1764 calling for the road to be turnpiked because it was stated to be &quot;in many places impassable for wheeled conveyances in winter&quot;. The highway covered by the trust extended for across east Sussex from Ringmer, near Lewes, in the west, to Hurst Green in the east, where it met the principal turnpike road from London to Hastings (today&#x27;s A21). The first section of road to be turnpiked ran from Hurst Green to Burwash; the rest followed three years later. A number of toll gates and bars were erected in the Burwash area on the principal highway and side roads. Although the trust repaired and improved the existing parish roads it was not until around 1830 that entirely new sections of main road were built, including one at Burwash Common. In a parliamentary return of 1840 the trust reported the roads it administered to be in good condition, with the exception of a short branch running from Burwash Common towards Stonegate. The trust was wound up in November 1864.

The road through Burwash was a notorious spot for highwaymen.

Burwash was one of the villages involved in the Wealden iron industry, and there was a forge located at Burwash Weald, close to the site of the historic &quot;Wheel&quot; public house.

A traditional marriage-rhyme includes the archaic pronunciation of the name: &quot;To love and to cherish, / From Battle to Berrish, / And round about Robertsbridge home ...&quot; (&quot;Burrish&quot; is a variant pronunciation mentioned in 1933).

St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church is a Grade II* listed building.

The High Street has been designated a Conservation area by Rother District Council. The intention is to preserve the character of the village by strictly controlling building within the area. Additionally, the buildings along the High Street have been given listed building status by English Heritage, including a garden wall. The Bateman&#x27;s mansion, a fine example of Jacobean architecture formerly owned by Rudyard Kipling, is now a National Trust property, open to the public. It can be found just outside the main village on the Burwash Weald and Common side, and is set within of the Sussex Weald, and includes a working watermill and millpond, which connects to the River Dudwell. The location was used while shooting the film &quot;My Boy Jack&quot; (2007), starring Daniel Radcliffe. A bronze statue of Kipling by the local sculptor Victoria Atkinson was installed in the High Street in 2019.

There is a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the parish—Dallington Forest, an area of ancient woodland. Its interest lies in a nationally rare habitat as a result of a steep-sided stream flowing through the site.
Burwash is located within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==Governance==
The lowest level of government is the Burwash parish council, which meets once a month. The parish council is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. It also provides a voice into the district council meetings. The parish council comprises thirteen councillors with elections being held every four years.

Rother District Council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Burwash lies within the Darwell ward, which provides two councillors.

East Sussex County Council is the third tier of government, providing education, libraries and highway maintenance. Burwash falls within the Rother North West ward.

The UK Parliament constituency for Burwash is Bexhill and Battle, which has been represented by Dr. Kieran Mullan since the 2024 general election.

==Notable people==
As Kipling&#x27;s main home, Bateman&#x27;s was host to many notable visitors including fellow author Sir Henry Rider Haggard and Kipling&#x27;s cousin Stanley Baldwin, who was Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister from 1935 to 1937. Kingsley Amis visited Bateman&#x27;s whilst preparing a tribute to Kipling (Amis&#x27;s father was a resident of Burwash in the 1960s). Ex-Prime Minister James Callaghan lived just outside the village. &quot;Picture Post&quot; photographer Thurston Hopkins was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s Salesian school in the village.

Cricketers Edward Hussey (1749–1816) and Albert Relf (1874–1937) were born here, The Who frontman Roger Daltrey maintains a Holmshurst Manor country estate and Lakedown fishery near Burwash Common, Robert Smith, singer and founding member of rock band The Cure is a resident.

<text>Zoë Kate Hinde Heller (born 7 July 1965) is an English journalist and novelist long resident in New York City. She has published three novels, &quot;Everything You Know&quot; (1999), &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Believers&quot; (2008). &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and was adapted for a feature film in 2006.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Heller was born in St Pancras, north London, as the youngest of four children of Caroline (née Carter) and Lukas Heller, a successful screenwriter; her parents separated when she was five. Her father was a German Jewish immigrant and her mother was English and a Quaker. Her paternal grandfather was the political philosopher Hermann Heller. Her brother is screenwriter Bruno Heller. Her sister, Lucy Heller, is Chief Executive of education charity Ark and previously Managing Director of Times Supplements Ltd, the former educational publishing wing of News UK.

She attended Haverstock School in north London where she was a contemporary of David Miliband and then studied English at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, gaining a first, before going on to Columbia University, New York where she received an MA on Marxist theories of literature and Jonathan Swift.

===Career===
After a period at the UK publisher Chatto and a spell as a freelance book reviewer, Heller was taken on as a staff feature writer for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;. She later returned to New York in the early 1990s contracted to write for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Deputizing for Nick Hornby while he was on holiday led to her reputation as a confessional writer. She wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, a weekly column for &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; in the UK, and was a columnist for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, for which she won the British Press Awards&#x27; &quot;Columnist of the Year&quot; in 2002. She co-wrote the screenplay for the independent film, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; (1991).

==Publications==
Heller has published three novels, &quot;Everything You Know&quot; (1999), &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2003), which was one of six books shortlisted for the Booker Prize and was made into a film in 2006, and &quot;The Believers&quot; (2008). &quot;The Believers&quot; was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2010.

In 2009, she donated the short story &quot;What She Did On Her Summer Vacation&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s &#x27;Ox-Tales&#x27; project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Her story was published in the &#x27;Water&#x27; collection.

==Personal life==
In 2006, she married screenwriter Lawrence Konner in a &quot;minimally&quot; Jewish ceremony; the couple separated in 2010. Heller lives in New York City with her two daughters, Lula and Frankie.

<doc id="1129074" wikidata="Q1153553" url="?curid=1129074" title="Grand canonical ensemble">
<text>In statistical mechanics, the grand canonical ensemble (also known as the macrocanonical ensemble) is the statistical ensemble that is used to represent the possible states of a mechanical system of particles that are in thermodynamic equilibrium (thermal and chemical) with a reservoir. The system is said to be open in the sense that the system can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir, so that various possible states of the system can differ in both their total energy and total number of particles. The system&#x27;s volume, shape, and other external coordinates are kept the same in all possible states of the system.

The thermodynamic variables of the grand canonical ensemble are chemical potential (symbol: ) and absolute temperature (symbol: . The ensemble is also dependent on mechanical variables such as volume (symbol: , which influence the nature of the system&#x27;s internal states. This ensemble is therefore sometimes called the ensemble, as each of these three quantities are constants of the ensemble.

== Basics ==

In simple terms, the grand canonical ensemble assigns a probability to each distinct microstate given by the following exponential:
: formula_1
where is the number of particles in the microstate and is the total energy of the microstate. is the Boltzmann constant.

The number is known as the grand potential and is constant for the ensemble. However, the probabilities and will vary if different are selected. The grand potential serves two roles: to provide a normalization factor for the probability distribution (the probabilities, over the complete set of microstates, must add up to one); and, many important ensemble averages can be directly calculated from the function .

In the case where more than one kind of particle is allowed to vary in number, the probability expression generalizes to
: formula_1
where is the chemical potential for the first kind of particles, is the number of that kind of particle in the microstate, is the chemical potential for the second kind of particles and so on ( is the number of distinct kinds of particles). However, these particle numbers should be defined carefully (see the note on particle number conservation below).

The distribution of the grand canonical ensemble is called generalized Boltzmann distribution by some authors.

Grand ensembles are apt for use when describing systems such as the electrons in a conductor, or the photons in a cavity, where the shape is fixed but the energy and number of particles can easily fluctuate due to contact with a reservoir (e.g., an electrical ground or a dark surface, in these cases). The grand canonical ensemble provides a natural setting for an exact derivation of the Fermi–Dirac statistics or Bose–Einstein statistics for a system of non-interacting quantum particles (see examples below).

; Note on formulation :
: An alternative formulation for the same concept writes the probability as formula_3, using the grand partition function formula_4 rather than the grand potential. The equations in this article (in terms of grand potential) may be restated in terms of the grand partition function by simple mathematical manipulations.

== Applicability ==

The grand canonical ensemble is the ensemble that describes the possible states of an isolated system that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir (the derivation proceeds along lines analogous to the heat bath derivation of the normal canonical ensemble, and can be found in Reif). The grand canonical ensemble applies to systems of any size, small or large; it is only necessary to assume that the reservoir with which it is in contact is much larger (i.e., to take the macroscopic limit).

The condition that the system is isolated is necessary in order to ensure it has well-defined thermodynamic quantities and evolution. In practice, however, it is desirable to apply the grand canonical ensemble to describe systems that are in direct contact with the reservoir, since it is that contact that ensures the equilibrium. The use of the grand canonical ensemble in these cases is usually justified either 1) by assuming that the contact is weak, or 2) by incorporating a part of the reservoir connection into the system under analysis, so that the connection&#x27;s influence on the region of interest is correctly modeled. Alternatively, theoretical approaches can be used to model the influence of the connection, yielding an open statistical ensemble.

Another case in which the grand canonical ensemble appears is when considering a system that is large and thermodynamic (a system that is &quot;in equilibrium with itself&quot;). Even if the exact conditions of the system do not actually allow for variations in energy or particle number, the grand canonical ensemble can be used to simplify calculations of some thermodynamic properties. The reason for this is that various thermodynamic ensembles (microcanonical, canonical) become equivalent in some aspects to the grand canonical ensemble, once the system is very large. Of course, for small systems, the different ensembles are no longer equivalent even in the mean. As a result, the grand canonical ensemble can be highly inaccurate when applied to small systems of fixed particle number, such as atomic nuclei.

== Properties ==

== Grand potential, ensemble averages, and exact differentials ==

The partial derivatives of the function give important grand canonical ensemble average quantities:
&quot;Exact differential&quot;: From the above expressions, it can be seen that the function has the exact differential
: formula_5

&quot;First law of thermodynamics&quot;: Substituting the above relationship for into the exact differential of , an equation similar to the first law of thermodynamics is found, except with average signs on some of the quantities:
: formula_6

&quot;Thermodynamic fluctuations&quot;: The variances in energy and particle numbers are
: formula_7
: formula_8

&quot;Correlations in fluctuations&quot;: The covariances of particle numbers and energy are
:formula_9
:formula_10

== Example ensembles ==

The usefulness of the grand canonical ensemble is illustrated in the examples below. In each case the grand potential is calculated on the basis of the relationship
: formula_11
which is required for the microstates&#x27; probabilities to add up to 1.

=== Statistics of noninteracting particles ===

==== Bosons and fermions (quantum) ====

In the special case of a quantum system of many &quot;non-interacting&quot; particles, the thermodynamics are simple to compute.
Since the particles are non-interacting, one can compute a series of single-particle stationary states, each of which represent a separable part that can be included into the total quantum state of the system.
For now let us refer to these single-particle stationary states as &quot;orbitals&quot; (to avoid confusing these &quot;states&quot; with the total many-body state), with the provision that each possible internal particle property (spin or polarization) counts as a separate orbital.
Each orbital may be occupied by a particle (or particles), or may be empty.

Since the particles are non-interacting, we may take the viewpoint that &quot;each orbital forms a separate thermodynamic system&quot;.
Thus each orbital is a grand canonical ensemble unto itself, one so simple that its statistics can be immediately derived here. Focusing on just one orbital labelled , the total energy for a microstate of particles in this orbital will be , where is the characteristic energy level of that orbital. The grand potential for the orbital is given by one of two forms, depending on whether the orbital is bosonic or fermionic:

In each case the value formula_12 gives the thermodynamic average number of particles on the orbital: the Fermi–Dirac distribution for fermions, and the Bose–Einstein distribution for bosons.
Considering again the entire system, the total grand potential is found by adding up the for all orbitals.

==== Indistinguishable classical particles ====
In classical mechanics it is also possible to consider indistinguishable particles (in fact, indistinguishability is a prerequisite for defining a chemical potential in a consistent manner; all particles of a given kind must be interchangeable). We can consider a region of the single-particle phase space with approximately uniform energy to be an &quot;orbital&quot; labelled .

Two complications arise since this orbital actually encompasses many (infinite) distinct states. Briefly:

* An overcounting correction of is needed since the &quot;many&quot;-particle phase space contains copies of the same actual state (formed by the permutation of the particles&#x27; different exact states).
* The chosen width of the orbital is arbitrary, thus there is a further proportionality factor that is independent of .

Due to the overcounting correction, the summation now takes the form of an exponential power series,
: formula_13
the value formula_14 corresponding to Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics.

=== Ionization of an isolated atom ===

The grand canonical ensemble can be used to predict whether an atom prefers to be in a neutral state or ionized state.
An atom is able to exist in ionized states with more or fewer electrons compared to neutral. As shown below, ionized states may be thermodynamically preferred depending on the environment.
Consider a simplified model where the atom can be in a neutral state or in one of two ionized states (a detailed calculation also includes excited states and the degeneracy factors of the states):
* charge neutral state, with electrons and energy .
* an oxidized state ( electrons) with energy 
* a reduced state ( electrons) with energy 
Here and are the atom&#x27;s ionization energy and electron affinity, respectively; is the local electrostatic potential in the vacuum nearby the atom, and is the electron charge.

The grand potential in this case is thus determined by
: formula_15

The quantity is critical in this case, for determining the balance between the various states. This value is determined by the environment around the atom.

* If a lone atom is placed in metal box, then , the work function of the box lining material. If formula_16 then the atom prefers to exist as a positive ion. This spontaneous surface ionization effect has been used as a cesium ion source.
* If the atom is surrounded by an ideal electron gas with density formula_17, then formula_18, and substituting this in yields the Saha ionization equation.
* In semiconductors, where the ionization of a dopant atom is well described by this ensemble. In the semiconductor, the conduction band edge plays the role of the vacuum energy level (replacing ), and is known as the Fermi level. Of course, the ionization energy and electron affinity of the dopant atom are strongly modified relative to their vacuum values. A typical donor dopant in silicon, phosphorus, has .

== Meaning of chemical potential, generalized &quot;particle number&quot; ==

In order for a particle number to have an associated chemical potential, it must be conserved during the internal dynamics of the system, and only able to change when the system exchanges particles with an external reservoir.

If the particles can be created out of energy during the dynamics of the system, then an associated term must not appear in the probability expression for the grand canonical ensemble. In effect, this is the same as requiring that for that kind of particle. Such is the case for photons in a black cavity, whose number regularly change due to absorption and emission on the cavity walls. (On the other hand, photons in a highly reflective cavity can be conserved and caused to have a nonzero .)

In some cases the number of particles is not conserved and the represents a more abstract conserved quantity:
* &quot;Chemical reactions&quot;: Chemical reactions can convert one type of molecule to another; if reactions occur then the must be defined such that they do not change during the chemical reaction.
* &quot;High energy particle physics&quot;: Ordinary particles can be spawned out of pure energy, if a corresponding antiparticle is created. If this sort of process is allowed, then neither the number of particles nor antiparticles are conserved. Instead, is conserved. As particle energies increase, there are more possibilities to convert between particle types, and so there are fewer numbers that are truly conserved. At the very highest energies, the only conserved numbers are electric charge, weak isospin, and baryon–lepton number difference.

On the other hand, in some cases a single kind of particle may have multiple conserved numbers:
* &quot;Closed compartments&quot;: In a system composed of multiple compartments that share energy but do not share particles, it is possible to set the chemical potentials separately for each compartment. For example, a capacitor is composed of two isolated conductors and is charged by applying a difference in electron chemical potential.
* &quot;Slow equilibration&quot;: In some quasi-equilibrium situations it is possible to have two distinct populations of the same kind of particle in the same location, which are each equilibrated internally but not with each other. Though not strictly in equilibrium, it may be useful to name quasi-equilibrium chemical potentials which can differ among the different populations. Examples: (semiconductor physics) distinct quasi-Fermi levels (electron chemical potentials) in the conduction band and valence band; (spintronics) distinct spin-up and spin-down chemical potentials; (cryogenics) distinct parahydrogen and orthohydrogen chemical potentials.

== Precise expressions for the ensemble ==

The precise mathematical expression for statistical ensembles has a distinct form depending on the type of mechanics under consideration (quantum or classical), as the notion of a &quot;microstate&quot; is considerably different. In quantum mechanics, the grand canonical ensemble affords a simple description since diagonalization provides a set of distinct microstates of a system, each with well-defined energy and particle number. The classical mechanical case is more complex as it involves not stationary states but instead an integral over canonical phase space.

=== Quantum mechanical ===

A statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a density matrix, denoted by formula_19. The grand canonical ensemble is the density matrix
: formula_20
where is the system&#x27;s total energy operator (Hamiltonian), is the system&#x27;s total particle number operator for particles of type 1, is the total particle number operator for particles of type 2, and so on. is the matrix exponential operator. The grand potential is determined by the probability normalization condition that the density matrix has a trace of one, formula_21:
: formula_22

Note that for the grand ensemble, the basis states of the operators , , etc. are all states with &quot;multiple particles&quot; in Fock space, and the density matrix is defined on the same basis. Since the energy and particle numbers are all separately conserved, these operators are mutually commuting.

The grand canonical ensemble can alternatively be written in a simple form using bra–ket notation, since it is possible (given the mutually commuting nature of the energy and particle number operators) to find a complete basis of simultaneous eigenstates , indexed by , where , , and so on. Given such an eigenbasis, the grand canonical ensemble is simply
: formula_23
: formula_24
where the sum is over the complete set of states with state having total energy, particles of type 1, particles of type 2, and so on.

=== Classical mechanical ===

In classical mechanics, a grand ensemble is instead represented by a joint probability density function defined over multiple phase spaces of varying dimensions, , where the and are the canonical coordinates (generalized momenta and generalized coordinates) of the system&#x27;s internal degrees of freedom. The expression for the grand canonical ensemble is somewhat more delicate than the canonical ensemble since:
* The number of particles and thus the number of coordinates varies between the different phase spaces, and,
* it is vital to consider whether permuting similar particles counts as a distinct state or not.
In a system of particles, the number of degrees of freedom depends on the number of particles in a way that depends on the physical situation. For example, in a three-dimensional gas of monoatoms , however in molecular gases there will also be rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom.

The probability density function for the grand canonical ensemble is:
: formula_25
where
* is the energy of the system, a function of the phase ,
* is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of , setting the extent of one microstate and providing correct dimensions to .
* is an overcounting correction factor (see below), a function of .

Again, the value of is determined by demanding that is a normalized probability density function:
: formula_26
This integral is taken over the entire available phase space for the given numbers of particles.

==== Overcounting correction ====

A well-known problem in the statistical mechanics of fluids (gases, liquids, plasmas) is how to treat particles that are similar or identical in nature: should they be regarded as distinguishable or not? In the system&#x27;s equation of motion each particle is forever tracked as a distinguishable entity, and yet there are also valid states of the system where the positions of each particle have simply been swapped: these states are represented at different places in phase space, yet would seem to be equivalent.

If the permutations of similar particles are regarded to count as distinct states, then the factor above is simply . From this point of view, ensembles include every permuted state as a separate microstate. Although appearing benign at first, this leads to a problem of severely non-extensive entropy in the canonical ensemble, known today as the Gibbs paradox. In the grand canonical ensemble a further logical inconsistency occurs: the number of distinguishable permutations depends not only on how many particles are in the system, but also on how many particles are in the reservoir (since the system may exchange particles with a reservoir). In this case the entropy and chemical potential are non-extensive but also badly defined, depending on a parameter (reservoir size) that should be irrelevant.

To solve these issues it is necessary that the exchange of two similar particles (within the system, or between the system and reservoir) must not be regarded as giving a distinct state of the system. In order to incorporate this fact, integrals are still carried over full phase space but the result is divided by
: formula_27
which is the number of different permutations possible. The division by neatly corrects the overcounting that occurs in the integral over all phase space.

It is of course possible to include distinguishable &quot;types&quot; of particles in the grand canonical ensemble—each distinguishable type formula_28 is tracked by a separate particle counter formula_29 and chemical potential formula_30. As a result, the only consistent way to include &quot;fully distinguishable&quot; particles in the grand canonical ensemble is to consider every possible distinguishable type of those particles, and to track each and every possible type with a separate particle counter and separate chemical potential.

<doc id="1129075" wikidata="Q6114455" url="?curid=1129075" title="Jack Orchulli">
<text>Jack Orchulli (born 1946 in Pennsylvania) is an American former founder and CEO of Michael Kors and former political candidate from Connecticut.

== Early education ==
Raised in Alpha, New Jersey, he went to Phillipsburg Catholic High School, and then received a degree from Rutgers University.

He later attended night school and received a master&#x27;s degree in finance from Baruch College in New York City.

== Political career ==
He is a Darien, Connecticut, resident and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for the Connecticut seat held by Christopher Dodd in the 2004 U.S. Senate election.

=== The split with Michael Kors ===
Orchulli, previously an independent, became a Republican in August 2003 shortly before launching his bid for the U.S. Senate and ran for office with no prior political experience. Just months before deciding to run for the U.S. Senate, Orchulli sold his family&#x27;s ownership interest in Michael Kors (a fashion enterprise) in 2003 and announced his retirement from business. Orchulli had started the Michael Kors Company with Kors in 1981 and remained its CEO/partner until he left the company which, then, had a retail sales volume of about $200 million worldwide.

=== First campaign ===
In November 2004, Orchulli garnered 33 percent of the vote as a long-shot standing against incumbent Senator Christopher Dodd, who won his fifth consecutive term for the Democrats with 66 percent of the vote.

=== Second campaign ===
Two years later, Orchulli was considered a possible mid-campaign replacement for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Alan Schlesinger, who had come under media fire for a claim that Schlesinger had gambled in the past under an assumed name at Connecticut casinos. Schlesinger was running for the seat held by U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman in the November 2006 election. However, Orchulli decided not to pursue a late entry campaign.

In 2006 and 2007, Orchulli, as a newcomer to small-town politics, led the local Darien (CT) Republican Party to its largest defeat in the history of the town&#x27;s municipal elections. In November 2007, in the town where Republicans outnumber Democrats 3 to 1, Orchulli and the Republicans lost control of the Board of Selectmen to the Democrats by a vote of 65% to 35%, unprecedented for the town and mirroring Orchulli&#x27;s 66% to 32% defeat by Dodd three years earlier

=== Chairmanship ===
He was the state Republican Party finance chair in 2007. In addition, he was a board member of the Connecticut Development Corporation for over three years, a quasi-state government organization which looks to retain and grow jobs in the state.

=== Third campaign ===
On May 22, 2010, Orchulli was nominated to be the Republican candidate for State Comptroller, the post being vacated by incumbent Democrat Nancy Wyman. Orchulli went on to lose the general election to Democrat Kevin Lembo, receiving 43% of the vote.

In November 2012, Orchulli was quoted as saying about a fellow unsuccessful candidate for the senate, Linda McMahon&#x27;s decision to align herself with Obama that it &quot;showed, from my perspective, a sense of desperation.&quot;

=== Fourth campaign ===
In 2016, Orchulli sought the Republican nomination to run for U.S. Senate against the incumbent Democrat Richard Blumenthal. He placed third at the state Republican convention on May 9 and urged his delegates to support party nominee Dan Carter.

== Private life ==
He has one son, Andrew, who resides in New York City.
