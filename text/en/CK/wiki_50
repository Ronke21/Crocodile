<text>Cat food is food specifically formulated and designed for consumption by cats. As obligate carnivores, cats have specific requirements for their dietary nutrients, namely nutrients found only in meat or synthesized, such as taurine and vitamin A. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency. Cat food is typically sold as dry kibble, or as wet food in cans and pouches.

==History==

During the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently horse meat, was sold from barrows (hand–carts) by traders known as Cats&#x27; Meat Men or Women. Henry Mayhew estimated in &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot; (1851) that the total number of cats in London might be 300,000. Each cats&#x27; meat seller had a particular route and served a few hundred households, their approach marked by mewing cats.

The idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than dog food and dog biscuits. This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:

In 1844, another French writer, Nicolas Jean-Baptiste Boyard, expanded on this idea:
He goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: &quot;A good cat takes many and eats few.&quot;

By 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:

In the same year, an advertisement for Spratt (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded &quot;the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh&quot;. And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company&#x27;s food:

Spratt, which began by making dog biscuits, was the first commercial producer of ready-made cat food.

==Natural diet==
Cats are obligate carnivores—meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs in nature. Even domesticated cats can consume freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, whether through hunting or by having it provided by humans. The natural diet of cats does not include any vegetable matter.

Cats cannot synthesize some nutrients that are non-essential for humans and required for survival, including the amino acids taurine and arginine. Some of these nutrients are not found in plants and must be sourced from meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from raw plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet.

==Packaging and labeling==

In the United States, cat food using the label &quot;complete and balanced&quot; is required to meet standards that have been established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) by either meeting a nutrient profile or passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 2014 by the AAFCO&#x27;s Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the National Research Council (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions. However, &quot;While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.&quot;

==Gastrointestinal health==
The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the source of nutrient absorption, making it integral to overall health. Research shows fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, antioxidants and fatty acids are important in maintaining gastrointestinal health.

To achieve optimal cellular health (especially in the gut) and to maintain a healthy microbiome, proper nutrition is necessary (nutrition is multifactorial and complex). 
Cats with gastrointestinal diseases must consume an easily digestible diet with the appropriate nutrients provided by easily digestible ingredients and in the correct ratio which is recommended to be fed in small portions frequently throughout the day, so as not to overwhelm the digestive system. 
It is also important for fat to be digestible because too much undigested fat that reaches the end of the digestive tract (colon) has the possibility of being fermented and can worsen the symptoms of GIT disease and induce other reactions like diarrhea. 
It has also been suggested that cats should eat diets tailored to the section of the GIT that is diseased.

When certain nutrients like fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are included in the diet, the microbiome and fatty acid content are often changed for the better. An example is less branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs; which are more difficult and take more time to digest) are produced and more short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; which are easier to digest and are more readily available sources of energy which can be used for supporting cell turnover keeping cells, like those found in the GIT, thereby improving GIT health and immune function) are produced.
FOS can also impact production of other fatty acids.

==Malnutrition==
Malnutrition can be a problem for cats fed non-conventional diets. Cats fed exclusively on raw, freshwater fish can develop a thiamine deficiency. Those fed exclusively on liver may develop vitamin A toxicity. Also, homemade diets, either &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27;, or &#x27;vegetarian&#x27; may contain excessive protein and phosphorus while being deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and microminerals such as copper, zinc, and potassium. Energy density must also be maintained relative to the other nutrients. When vegetable oil is used to maintain the energy balance, cats may not find the food as palatable, causing less food to be eaten.

==Commercial foods==
Most store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as &quot;kibble&quot;, or wet form (canned or in pouches). Some manufacturers sell frozen raw diets and premix products to cater to owners who feed raw.

===Dry===

Dry food (8–10% moisture) is generally made by extrusion cooking under high heat and pressure. Approximately 95% of dry pet foods are extruded. During this process, the meat is first ground up, cooked under very high heat, and processed so it becomes a powder. The powder is fed into a massive mixer. In the mixer, additional supplements are added; then it&#x27;s cooked again at very high heat to turn it into a dough, which is molded in the shape of kibble, and baked. At this point, it no longer smells like meat. Fat may be sprayed on the food afterwards to increase palatability, as well as other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall paper bags, sometimes with a plastic film layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.

Dry foods contain high amounts of carbohydrates in order to maintain their shape and structure. Concerns have been raised that there is some association between the carbohydrate content and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in felines.

===Wet===
In much of Europe, the UK and the US, canned or wet food (75–78% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in sizes. It is also sold in foil pouch form.

===Treats===
A variety of cat treats are commercially available. These can be divided into dry cat treats, wet cat treats, and semi-moist treats. A 2004 survey in the US and Australia found 26% of cats received treats on a daily basis. However, not more than 10% of a cat&#x27;s calorie intake should come from treats.
===Soy isoflavones===
Soy is often used in commercial cat food diets as a vegetable protein. In one study more than half of commercial cat foods surveyed contained soy isoflavones. Genistein and daidzein, both of which occur in soybeans, inhibit the enzymes thyroid peroxidase and thyroxine 5-deiodinase. This causes decreased thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations. In response to decreased triiodothyronine levels the body will produce more thyroid-stimulating hormone to normalize triiodothyronine levels, this has been shown to result in increased thyroxine levels. This may result in hyperplasia of the thyroid gland and thyrotoxicosis.

==Specialist diets==
Cat food may be formulated for a variety of specialist diets, for therapeutic or other purposes. A 2004 survey in the US and Australia found 3.6% of cats were fed therapeutic diets.

===Renal diet===

A renal diet is formulated for cats that are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is a highly prevalent condition in the feline population and is most common in aging and older cats. It has been shown that the lifespan of cats experiencing CKD can be extended by as much as 2 years when receiving therapeutic diets rather than regular maintenance diets. These diets are low in protein, low in phosphorus, have a high energy density, a higher fat content and include omega-3 fatty acids.

Renal diets with low protein have been adopted by a number of big pet food manufacturers. Although the diet of a healthy cat should be high in protein, at times it is medically necessary for a cat to eat a low protein diet. For cats living with chronic renal disease, low protein diets lower the amount of nitrogenous waste in the body, helping to decrease the strain put on the kidneys. The exact level of protein that is needed for therapeutic CKD diets is unclear.

Low protein diets can be formulated as a wet or dry food, with the main difference being the moisture content. Unfortunately, low protein diets are not as palatable to cats as diets high in protein.

Low protein diets should not be fed to cats with the liver condition known as hepatic encephalopathy because severe protein restriction can be detrimental to animals with this condition. Cats with this condition should be fed a diet with high quality protein sources that have adequate amounts of the amino acids taurine and arginine.

In low protein diets, unless the protein source is a high quality protein such as an animal-based protein, cats (and especially kittens) have been shown to develop retinal degeneration due to a deficiency in taurine, an essential amino acid for cats that is derived from animal protein.

Low protein diets have been linked to health defects such as lack of growth, decreased food intake, muscle atrophy, hypoalbuminemia, skin alterations, and more. Cats on lower protein diets are more likely to lose weight, and to lose lean body mass.

Low protein diets that are high in carbohydrates have been found to decrease glucose tolerance in cats. With a decreased glucose tolerance, clinical observations have confirmed that cats consuming large proportions of metabolizable energy, in the form of carbohydrates rather than protein, are more likely to develop hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and obesity.

Restricting phosphorus has been proven to decrease the progression of CKD. This is because phosphorus can be deposited into soft tissues and become mineralized, which can cause kidney damage.

Formulating these diets with higher amounts of fat is important to make sure the food is palatable in the absence of protein and promote an increased caloric intake. The higher fat content will also spare the use of protein for energy and help decrease stress on the kidneys. Omega-3 fatty acids are included in therapeutic diets because of their anti-inflammatory properties to aid the diseased kidneys.

===High energy===
A high energy diet is generally high in fat. Compared to carbohydrates and protein, fat provides much more energy, at 8.5 kcal/g. High energy diets generally have a fat content greater than 20% on a dry matter basis. A high energy diet is appropriate for cats who are undergoing growth, recovering from illness, are pregnant or lactating, as their energy requirements are higher than otherwise. A lactating or gestating cat requires a nutrient-dense and highly digestible diet to withstand the high levels of stress being placed on her body. These conditions are found in cat food that is formulated for growth, performance, or high energy during all life stages.

To maintain a neutral energy balance and thus maintain body weight, energy intake should increase with energy expenditure. Studies that relate the number of meals offered to cats per day to their daily activity levels have shown conflicting results. It has been shown that cats offered four meals a day or a random number of meals a day have similar energy levels, greater than those fed only one meal per day. It has been postulated that this increased energy level could be due to purported spikes in activity before being fed, known as food anticipatory activity. Other studies on female cats have found that increasing the daily amount of food may actually decrease their daily activity levels. The age, sex, and whether cats are intact or have been spayed/neutered are all factors controlling activity level.

As cats age, there is evidence that their metabolic energy requirements may increase, especially after 12 or 13 years old, but other evidence suggests that metabolic energy needs are not dissimilar at different ages. Furthermore, it has been shown that cats over 12 years old are more likely to be underweight than younger cats, so a high calorie diet may be appropriate to treat weight loss, and thus to maintain an appropriate body condition score. Weight loss can occur when the cat expends more energy but does not increase its food energy intake. It has also been demonstrated that as cats age, they are less able to digest and thus absorb dietary fats and proteins.

Pregnancy and lactation are strenuous periods on the female cat. During pregnancy a cat should gain 38% of their body weight by the time they are ready to give birth. It is recommended that a cat&#x27;s diet should contain 4000 kcal per kg of dry food while pregnant; during lactation it is recommended that the cat consumes 240–354 kcal ME per kg of body weight. Studies show that increasing the intake of food for a pregnant animal in order to help it gain weight can have negative effects. It is acknowledged that rather than increasing intake, feeding a highly energy dense food is a way to ensure that the female cat, or queen, receives adequate energy and nutrient requirements are met.

It has been found that nutritional support consistent with the resting energy requirement (RER) soon after surgery or the onset of illness decreases the mortality rate and the duration of hospitalization in cats. A recovering cat needs enough energy (calories), as well as more protein and fats. Critical care diets are formulated to be highly palatable and digestible, as well as high energy density. This limits the mass of food required to be consumed to meet the RER. This type of high energy diet has proven to be very important in the nutritional support of post-operative and ill cats.

===Raw food===
Raw feeding is providing uncooked ingredients to cats. Most of the diet will consist of animal-based ingredients, though fruits, vegetables and supplements are often added. Commercial raw food is mainly sold in three formats: fresh, frozen and freeze-dried. Thawing and rehydration are necessary before feeding frozen and freeze-dried food respectively. Many available commercial diets are AAFCO certified in meeting the nutrient requirements of the cat. Some diets may be formulated for all life stages or they can also be AAFCO certified for adult maintenance or growth and gestation/lactation. Many people feed their cats raw food believing that it mimics the prey diet that wild cats would consume. Firm believers report that such a diet can bring about many health benefits, such as a shinier coat, cleaner teeth and an improved immunity to various gastrointestinal ailments (with diarrhea and constipation being the most common), as well as an increase in energy and a decrease in bodily waste odours, although no scientific evidence exists to prove these claims. In addition, raw food comes at risk of malnutrition (by inexpert formulation) and infection (to the cat and other family members).

Commercial raw diets can undergo High Pressure Pasteurization (HPP), a process which kills bacteria and pathogens, including salmonella, using high water pressure. This technique is USDA approved and allows raw food to remain uncooked while greatly improving its safety and shelf-life. However, every year, many commercial raw pet foods are recalled due to various bacterial contamination, implying that feeding raw comes with a risk.

===Weight control===

Weight control simply means ensuring an energy balance: energy in equals energy out. Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance.

Adult cats should be fed a diet that promotes maintaining a healthy weight, while at the same time meeting the individual taste preference of the cat. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which can lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice (always available) food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight with no weight gain. In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviors. Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients. Studies have shown that cats fed lower energy diets had a significantly reduced incidence of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10–11 pounds (about 5 kg), it would have a resting energy requirement of 180–200 kcal/day.

Along with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight, along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and commensal bacterial growth and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannooligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation. Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, psyllium and cellulose.

Another nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolized as energy before using fat stores, even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat. Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein. Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food. The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.

An important component of many weight loss/weight control diets is L-carnitine. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation. At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.

===Grain-free===
Grain free cat food substitutes the typical carbohydrate sources like wheat, corn or rice with alternative sources such as white potato, peas, sweet potato or tapioca.

A study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery in 2018 compared the carbohydrate content between grain-free diets and diets containing grains. According to this study the proportion of cat food purchased that is grain free has increased from 4% to 9% between 2012 and 2014. The researchers at Tufts University analyzed the nutritional information and contents of 77 different dry cat food diets. 42 of these diets contained grain, while 35 were labeled as grain free. The major ingredients and amounts were determined for each diet and then analyses were conducted comparing the two groups. It was found that the grain free diets had a lower mean carbohydrate content than the diets containing grain; however, there was a very wide range and lots of overlap between the two groups in both their carbohydrate contents. Some grain free diets even had a higher amount of carbohydrates than the diets containing grain. Calorie amounts were similar for both diets.

A recent study published by the FDA has potentially linked pea- or legume-containing grain free diets to dilated cardiomyopathy in both dogs and cats. While the majority of cases reported were for canines, 14 cases were reported between 2014 and 2019 for cats.

===Vegetarian and vegan===
Vegetarian or vegan cat food has been available for many years, and is targeted primarily at vegan and vegetarian pet owners. While a small percentage of owners choose such a diet based on its perceived health benefits, the majority do so due to ethical concerns, such as about the large environmental impacts of animal agriculture. There is significant controversy over feeding cats a vegetarian or vegan diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3390/vetsci10010052&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As obligate carnivores, cats require nutrients (including arginine, taurine, arachidonic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B12 and niacin) found in meat sources. Plant sources typically do not contain enough of these. Deficiencies in taurine specifically can cause dilated cardiomyopathy, which can be fatal. 

Cats on a vegan diet can develop abnormally alkaline (high pH) urine as most commonly used plant-based proteins are more alkaline than the meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine becomes too alkaline (pH &gt;7), there is an increased risk of formation of struvite (also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate) bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur if the urine is too acidic and not corrected in time with acidifying supplementation. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment. This can prevented by monitoring urinary acidity and correcting supplementation if necessary.

Organizations that advocate vegan or vegetarian diets for people have split opinions regarding vegetarian or vegan cat food. The International Vegetarian Union, the Vegan Society and PETA are some of the organizations that support a vegan or vegetarian diet for cats. But the Vegetarian Society suggests people &quot;consider carefully&quot; and that many cats will not adjust to a vegetarian diet. The Animal Protection Institute also does not recommend a vegetarian diet for cats, and cautions that dietary deficiencies may take months or years to develop and may be untreatable. They do not recommend relying on supplements, because they may not contain necessary co-factors and enzymes and have not been studied for long term implications. Due to the risk of health complications, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommends against vegetarian and vegan diets for cats. Similarly, the British Veterinary Association has stated that cats should not be fed a vegetarian or vegan diet. A 2023 review recommended a cautious approach to due to the limited amount of research on the health impacts of vegan diets in cats and dogs, suggesting that commercial foods are used if guardians wish to implement a vegan diet.

==Homemade==
Many pet owners feed cats homemade diets. These diets generally consist of some form of cooked or raw meat, bone, vegetables, and supplements, such as taurine and multivitamins. Homemade diets either follow a recipe, such as the BARF (bone and raw food) diet which provides a series of options for the pet owner to make, or rely on the constant rotation of ingredients to meet nutrient requirements. A study was conducted that analyzed 95 homemade BARF diets and found that 60% of these were nutritionally imbalanced in either one or a combination of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, iodine, zinc, copper, or vitamin A content.

Another 2019 study on a range of homemade diet recipes found online and in books has also found nutritional inadequacies. The authors mention that vegetarianism and support for organics food are common reasons for trying such a diet, but does not specifically address the adequacy of vegetarian or organic diets.

==Nutrients and supplements==
Vitamin deficiencies can lead to wide-ranging clinical abnormalities that reflect the diversity of their metabolic roles. Twelve minerals are known to be essential nutrients for cats. Calcium and phosphorus are crucial to strong bones and teeth. Cats need other minerals, such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and cell signaling. Many minerals only present in minute amounts in the body, including selenium, copper, and molybdenum, act as helpers in a wide variety of enzymatic reactions.

The table below lists the AAFCO nutritional profiles for cat foods along with the roles of vitamins and minerals in cat nutrition according to the National Research Council.

Many nutrients can cause a variety of deficiency symptoms in cats, and the skin is a vital organ that is susceptible to dietary changes in minerals, protein, fatty acids, and vitamins A and B. Cats show dietary inadequacies in their skin through excess or inadequate oil production, and skin toughening. This results in dandruff, redness, hair loss, greasy skin, and reduced hair growth.

===Arginine===

Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Arginine is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the enzymes which are responsible for the synthesis of ornithine and citrulline in the small intestine (specifically, for pyrroline-5-carboxylate production). Citrulline would typically go on to the kidneys to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine. Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to hyperammonemia. The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, and hyperesthesia, and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. These symptoms appear quickly because diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.

===Zinc===
Zinc&#x27;s connection to skin and coat health is due to its influence on regulating cellular metabolism. Zinc also supports proper immune function and suitable activity within the inflammatory response. Deficiencies result in disorders of the skin and poor immune functioning. When zinc is supplemented in diets, skin scaliness decreases. Dietary sources include poultry, red meat, and eggs.

===Copper===
One of the many functions of copper is to assist in production of connective tissue and the pigment melanin. A deficiency in dietary copper is also related to collagen abnormalities, hypopigmentation of the skin, and alopecia. Sources for cats include liver and supplements in the forms of copper sulphate and cupric oxide.

===Selenium===
Selenium works with vitamin E as antioxidants to remove the free radicals that are damaging to the body and the skin. Selenium also plays a role with other antioxidants to help maintain cell membranes which provides further protection from free radicals causing oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a role in development of skin diseases. Dietary sources of selenium are naturally occurring in selenomethionine and tuna.

===Essential fatty acids===
A fatty acid molecule consists of a (COOH) group attached to an aliphatic chain. There are many types of fatty acid with different such chains. These different types have somewhat different properties. Saturated fatty acids have no carbon=carbon double bonds, while polyunsaturated fatty acids have more than one such bond in each molecule. The main form of fatty acids in diet is fats or triglycerides, which consist of three fatty acid groups attached to a glycerin molecule.

Fatty acids can become attached to different molecules such as carbohydrates or proteins, and can implement a wide range of functions in the body. These functions include long-term energy storage, insulation (prevents heat loss, protects vital organs, helps transmit nerve impulses faster), structure, transportation around the body for nutrients and other biological molecules. They can also be precursors to other compounds in the body, such as hormones (some of which are important for gut/immune/overall health). The length, degree of saturation and configuration of a fatty acid affects how it is broken down, absorbed and used in the gastrointestinal tract. Essential fatty acids (EFA) are nutrients that cats are unable to produce in sufficient amounts to meet their needs, or at all. All EFAs are polyunsaturated. EFAs also vary in size, have many different functions and can also be further divided into other categories, two of which are very important for gastrointestinal health: the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. (The omega number denotes the position of the first double bond in a fatty acid, counting from the methyl end.) These fatty acids are most effective when present in adequate and appropriate balanced ratios dependent upon stage of life and production of the animal. Omega-6 fatty acids at high levels can suppress the functions of the immune system (a large part of which is located in the gastrointestinal tract) and promote inflammation, platelet aggregation and hypersensitive reactions like allergies. Omega-3 fatty acids act in the opposite direction to omega-6 fatty acids, by reducing inflammation and depressing aggregation and immunosuppression. The diet provided will determine the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids consumed; the optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is considered to be within the range of 5:1 to 10:1. The right ratio helps reduce inflammation and mediate immune responses, as both types of fatty acid use the same enzymes in their metabolic journey.

There are three essential fatty acids that should be included in a cat&#x27;s diet: alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid. Alpha-linolenic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid that aids in the maintenance of the skin&#x27;s water barrier. Ingredients that are high in alpha-linolenic acid, such as flaxseed, should be included in the cat&#x27;s diet. Another source of omega-3s is fish oil. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are omega-3 fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties. Linoleic acid is an example of an omega-6 fatty acid that helps with the health of the cat&#x27;s skin by maintaining the integrity of their epithelial tissues. Linoleic acid is commonly found in plant-based oils like sunflower oil. Arachidonic acid is also essential to cats because they are unable to create it from linoleic acid due to an absence of the Delta 6 desaturase enzyme. It can be found in substances such as animal fat.

===Vitamin A===
Vitamin A is a crucial nutritional component in the maintenance of feline skin and coat health. In addition to its many other functions, vitamin A plays an important role in the keratinization of the skin, hair and nails along with assisting in the development of various epithelial tissues throughout the body. The cells making up the epithelial tissues of the skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts rely on vitamin A to successfully complete the process of mitosis in order preserve these tissues and repair any damages. The mucus-secreting cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium also specifically require vitamin A to successfully produce a specialized protein referred to as mucoproteins which aid in maintaining the health of these tissues. Unlike most other mammals, the cat is unique in that they are unable to transform B-carotene to vitamin A and therefore explicitly require active forms of vitamin A which are only found in animal products. This difference in metabolism is due to very low levels of activity of the enzyme B-carotene 15, 15&#x27; dioxygenase in feline species. The nutrient profiles developed by AAFCO currently advise a minimum of 3332 IU/kg of vitamin A on a dry matter basis included in adult diets and 6668 IU/kg in the diets of raising kittens as well as pregnant or lactating female cats. Common ingredients which help to incorporate the proper levels of vitamin A into feline diets include various types of liver as well as fish oils.

===B vitamins===
====Niacin (B3)====
Niacin is an essential vitamin for the cat; dietary deficiency can lead to anorexia, weight loss and an increase in body temperature. Biosynthesis of niacin occurs by metabolism of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway to quinolinic acid, the niacin precursor. However, cats have a high activity of picolinic acid carboxylase, which converts one of the intermediates to picolinic acid instead of quinolinic acid. As a result, niacin can become deficient and require supplementation.

====Biotin (B7)====
Biotin can be provided in feline diets by adding cooked eggs, liver, milk, legumes or nuts. Microorganisms living in the gastrointestinal tracts of cats are also able to synthesize and supply an alternative source of biotin if proper nutritional requirements are met. Its main function in metabolism is as a coenzyme for essential carboxylation reactions throughout the body; however it has also been shown to aid in the management of certain skin diseases in cats. Biotin is recommended by AAFCO to be included in feline diets at a minimum level of 0.07 mg/kg on a dry matter basis throughout all stages of development. It is required only when the cat is taking antimicrobials that kill gut bacteria.

===Vitamin C===

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble antioxidant and a free radical scavenger where it will donate an electron to compounds with unpaired elections or reactive but not radical compounds. Supplements of Vitamin C reduce oxidative DNA damage in cats prone to kidney injury, and can be beneficial to add into diets for cats with renal diseases. Vitamin C is not essential for cats and it is not required by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO); however, it is commonly added into pet foods as an antioxidant. Ascorbic acid is known to function in gene expression as a co-substrate, and have unique biosynthetic pathways in different organisms.

Unlike humans, felines are able to synthesize Vitamin C in the liver, via the glucuronate pathway. The simple sugars glucose and galactose are used as input. This pathway naturally maintains ascorbic acid (active Vitamin C) at an adequate level; therefore it does not need to be separately included in their diet.

===Vitamin D===

Vitamin D is a dietary requirement for cats as they lack the ability to efficiently synthesize vitamin D3 using sunlight. This fat-soluble vitamin is required in cats for bone formation through the promotion of calcium retention, along with nerve and muscle control through absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Wild cats probably gather vitamin D from prey liver.

Unlike dogs and humans, cats metabolize vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 slightly differently. A dose of Vitamin D2 is approximately 70% as effective as the same amount of vitamin D3.

===Vitamin E===

Vitamin E as an antioxidant in gastrointestinal health cat food diets can have a positive effect of improving the animal&#x27;s immune function and prevent against infections. Vitamin E is a free radical scavenger that functions as a chain-breaking antioxidant to prevent free radical damage of cell membranes. Vitamin E aids in protecting cells from highly reactive oxygen species within the lungs, muscles, skin, brain, tissues and red blood cells. Supplementation of vitamin E in the diet benefits the immune system and improves resistance to infections and diseases.

The National Research Council (NRC) suggested a ratio of vitamin E to polyunsaturated fatty acids be 0.6:1 to ensure enough vitamin E to combat any free radicals. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are prone to oxidative destruction in cellular membranes and increase the requirement for antioxidants.

Vitamin E is an essential nutrient which needs to be included in the feline diet in order to protect the lipid components within cellular membranes of various tissues in the body. Vitamin E is able to accomplish this through working with selenium and acting as an antioxidant to prevent free radicals from interacting with these fatty acid membrane components, resulting in reduced levels of oxidative stress. This is particularly important in the skin as various oxidative environmental components can have very damaging effects if not protected by vitamin E. The nutrient profiles developed by AAFCO currently advise a minimum dry matter inclusion of 40 IU/kg of vitamin E in the diet of cats throughout all stages of development. Lipid metabolism is also a major contributor of free radicals, leading to an increased dietary requirement of vitamin E as the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet increase. Ingredients such as wheat germ as well as certain plant oils contain high levels of active vitamin E and are commonly added to feline diets which are carefully stored in order to prevent oxidative destruction of vitamin E prior to consumption.

===Fiber===
The addition of fiber at optimal levels in a diet is essential for the normal function and health of the gastrointestinal tract. Cats are to occasionally consume plant material, mainly leaves, in response to a diet deficient in fiber.

Dietary fibers are plant carbohydrates which cannot be digested by mammalian enzymes. These structural plant carbohydrates include pectin, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, muclinage, and gums. Different types of fibers have varying levels of solubility and fermentation; this ranges from pectin which is highly fermentable, to beet pulp which is moderately fermentable, to cellulose which is non-fermentable. Non-fermentable fibers helps with satiety, maintenance of a normal intestinal transit time and gastrointestinal motility as well as increasing diet bulk. Fermentable fibers, on the other hand, are fermented to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the colon and have variable effects on gastric emptying. Moderately soluble fibers have been linked to increased colon weight as well as an increased mucosal surface area for absorption of nutrients.

Fiber, though it is not an essential nutrient, is important for a healthy gastrointestinal tract. The microbes found in the cat&#x27;s large intestine have the ability to ferment dietary fibers to short-chain fatty acids. Cells of the gastrointestinal tract are constantly dying and being replaced by new cells, which requires a lot of energy. The fatty acids produced are used as energy sources for these epithelial cells which line the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of the presence of energy from the fatty acids, colonic cell proliferation is increases.

Short-chain fatty acids production from dietary fibers have many other advantageous effects on the gastrointestinal tract. They increase motility by stimulating rhythmic contractions of the distal portion of the small intestine, which potentially decreases fermentation in the small intestine while increasing it in the large intestine for further fatty acid absorption. Blood flow to the colon also increases with the presence of short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids also increase sodium absorption which helps maintain normal electrolyte and fluid balance in the intestine, reducing the risk for diarrhea . These homeostatic conditions of the intestinal tract promote the growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting the proliferation of pathogenic ones. A healthy and balanced gut microbiome is important for maintaining a healthy digestive tract.

Fibers promote bacterial growth and activity in the large intestine. It is essential for a healthy gastrointestinal tract to have a healthy and stable gut microbiota. The microorganisms present in the colon are responsible for the fermentation of the fiber into short-chain fatty acids and for the production of some vitamins.

====Prebiotics====
Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates classified as fibers with an added aspect as they selectively promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. By promoting the health and proliferation of beneficial bacteria, they suppress the growth of pathogenic ones by outcompeting them. inulin, galactooligosaccharides, lactulose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS) are all examples of prebiotics.

===Probiotics===
Probiotics (live microbes) are becoming increasingly popular in the diets of felines. They are included in the diet to increase the number of bacteria and microbes that are normally present in a healthy gut. Probiotics are considered a supplement rather than part of nutrition. Therefore, there are no strict regulations to the amount of probiotics that should be included in foods.

The function of probiotics goes beyond basic nutrition and has many benefits to the health of the organism. The use of probiotics can help in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases or disorders of felines. Examples include prevention of allergies, diarrhea, symptoms relating to stress, etc. The health of the cats is very much dependent on the fermentation that occurs through gut biota. The gut biota has an important role in the metabolism, absorption, and protective functions of the gastro intestinal tract. Felines have different gut bacteria than canines. However, the most common biota that are found in both felines and canines are Bacillota, Bacteroidota, Pseudomonadota, and Fusobacteriota. Although these are the most common types of gut biota found in felines, there are variances between independent cats. Each cat has their own unique and independent number and type of gut microbes.

===Antioxidants===

Nutraceuticals such as antioxidants are considered to be additives of gastrointestinal diets to prevent digestive upset. Antioxidants have the ability to remove free radicals from the body which can cause damage to cell membranes, and are involved in chronic degenerative diseases. Free radicals amplify inflammation by causing release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Free radicals can be caused by many factors such as stress, disease and age. Some oxygen-derived free radicals can produce ischemia in the small bowel and stomach of cats. Combinations of antioxidants have been reported to improve serum vitamin status, suppress lipid peroxidation and distributes the effects of exercise on the immune system. The most common antioxidants found in cat gastrointestinal diets are vitamin E and vitamin C.

===Taurine===
Cats have a sulfinoalanine decarboxylase deficiency, preventing the synthesis of taurine from cysteine.

==Food allergy==

Food allergy is a non-seasonal disease with skin and/or gastrointestinal disorders. The main complaint is excessive scratching (pruritus) which is usually resistant to treatment by steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy/flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with dietary elimination-challenge trials. Allergy testing is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).

==Recalls and contaminants==

The broad pet food recalls starting in March 2007 came in response to reports of renal failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company beginning in February 2007. Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of melamine in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market was extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall. Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods.

===Bisphenol A===
A 2004 study reported that food packaged in cans coated with bisphenol A is correlated with the development of hyperthyroidism in cats.

==Environmental impact==
In a study on the impacts of the pet food industry on world fish and seafood supplies, researchers estimate that 2.48 million metric tonnes of fish are used by the cat food industry each year. It was suggested that there needs to be &quot;a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource, for human benefit.&quot; Marine conservation activist Paul Watson argues that the reduction in forage fish such as those commonly used in cat food (sardines, herring, anchovy etc.) negatively affects fish higher up the food chain like cod, tuna and swordfish, not to mention marine mammals and birds.

Based on 2004 numbers, cats in the US consume the caloric equivalent of what 192,000 (0.0655%) Americans consume. While pet food is made predominantly using byproducts from human food production, the increase in popularity of human-grade and byproduct-free pet food means there is increasing pressure on the overall meat supply.

AAFCO recommends 26% crude protein for feline diets on a dry matter basis. High animal protein in cat food has increased in popularity due to consumer demand for natural diets, in which protein content is usually much higher than the AAFCO minimum levels. This trend has led to a higher need for animal protein, which may have a detrimental effect on sustainability.

In 2015, there were an estimated 77.8 million dogs and 85.6 million cats in the USA. The consumer desire to feed their pets premium foods which advertise healthy and human-grade ingredients, coupled with more pet ownership, requires more meat; this could require more land for raising livestock. In a study conducted by Okin in 2017, he suggests that if a quarter of all animal protein used in the food of American pets was human-grade, it would be equivalent to the energy needs of 5 million Americans. Okin uses an estimate of 33% of an animal&#x27;s energy needs is derived from animal products; however, this is conservative in that many diets now have more than 33% of their diet in animal protein alone.

Lowering protein levels in feline diets may help to improve the sustainability of both the human and pet food system by decreasing pressure on livestock agriculture and ultimately improving environmental effects. Other ways to improve sustainability include using animal byproducts (organs not eaten by humans), plant (mainly pea) proteins, and insect proteins. In addition, feeding less food to an animal helps reduce the carbon footprint and chances of obesity.

==Nutrient chart==

;Notes

The European Union does not use a unified nutrient requirement. A manufacturer committee called FEDIAF (European Pet Food Industry Federation) makes recommendations for cats and dogs that members follow. Both AAFCO and FEDIAF publish in two formats: one in the amount-per-kilogram form above, another in an amount-per-unit-energy format.

<text>Norman Sherry FRSL (6 July 1925 – 19 October 2016) was an English novelist, biographer, and educator who was best known for his three-volume biography of the British novelist Graham Greene. He was Professor of English Literature at Lancaster University.

Sherry was born in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England, the younger twin (by eleven minutes) of Alan. Sherry studied at King&#x27;s College, Newcastle, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1955. 

He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He also wrote on Joseph Conrad, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, and Jane Austen. His &quot;Life of Graham Greene&quot; was praised by David Lodge for being &quot;a remarkable and heroic achievement&quot; that he predicted would prove &quot;the definitive biography of record&quot; of Greene.

From 1983, Sherry held the post of Mitchell Distinguished Professor of Literature at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas.

He was married three times: first to the children&#x27;s novelist Sylvia Sherry, then to Carmen Flores (with whom he had a son and a daughter), and finally to Pat Villalon. Sherry died on 19 October 2016 at the age of 91.

<text>Robert Patterson Lamont (December 1, 1867February 20, 1948) was United States secretary of commerce March 5, 1929 to August 7, 1932, during the administration of Herbert Hoover. He was commerce secretary during difficult times for commerce, as a result of the Great Depression.

== Life ==
Lamont was born in Detroit, Michigan on December 1, 1867, to Isabella (née Patterson) and Robert Lamont. He was educated at the University of Michigan, graduating in 1891 with a degree in civil engineering. He worked as an engineer at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Lamont married Helen Gertrude Trotter on October 24, 1894. They had three children: (Robert Patterson II, Gertrude and Dorothy Lamont). In 1897, he was hired by the Simplex Railway Appliance Company as first vice president. In 1905, the company was bought out by American Steel Foundries and Lamont remained a vice president. In 1912, he was appointed company president, a position he held until his Hoover administration appointment in 1929. Lamont was Secretary of Commerce from 1929 until 1932, when he resigned in order to become president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, where he stayed until 1934. Lamont died in Chicago, Illinois, in 1948. His grandson, Robert L. Belknap, was a professor of Russian literature at Columbia University.

<doc id="1132830" wikidata="Q1429276" url="?curid=1132830" title="Tivertsi">
<text>The Tivertsi (; ; or ), were a tribe of early East Slavs which lived in the lands near the Dniester, and probably the lower Danube, that is in modern-day western Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova and possibly in eastern Romania and the southern Odesa oblast of Ukraine. The Tivertsi were one of the tribes that formed the Ukrainian ethnicity, namely the sub-ethnic and historic region of Podolia. The Tivertsis&#x27; cultural inheritors, the Podolians, are a distinct group of Ukrainians.

==Ethnonym==
Other spellings include the anglicized form &quot;Tivertsians&quot; and the Slavic transliterated &quot;Tivertsy&quot;. George Vernadsky suggests that the name Tivertsi possibly originates from the fortress Turris of Justinian I, pointing out that the letter &quot;u&quot; was commonly rendered as &quot;v&quot; (or, rather, ypsilon), suggesting the common root &quot;tvr&quot; of Iranian origin, meaning &quot;fast&quot;. According to another theory is related with Turkic forms &quot;tyvar&quot; and &quot;tavar&quot; (&quot;cattle&quot;, &quot;property&quot;, &quot;riches&quot;, &quot;goods&quot;), which is seemingly related with the Slavic &quot;*stado&quot; (&quot;cluster (group) of cattle&quot;), which supposedly stands in the name of &quot;Stadici&quot; described by Bavarian Geographer as &quot;countless people&quot; who had 516 settlements, while the neighbour &quot;Unlizi&quot; (Ulichs) as &quot;populus multus&quot;, thus relating the Tivertsi with Stadici &quot;can be interpreted as Turkic – Slavic tracing, serving to designate a large tribe in the southwestern
part of present Ukraine.&quot; (some also related the White Croats with &quot;Stadici&quot;), or they could have been mentioned as &quot;Attorozi&quot;.

==History==
The original information about the tribe is scarce. Tivertsi and Ulichs are briefly mentioned in early Ruthenian manuscripts, 863 being the earliest reference, 944 being the latest. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; from the &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot; (the oldest copy) mentions that they lived by the Dniester and Danube down to the sea (evidently, the Black Sea). The &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; (later re-copy) replaces the Dniester with the Dnieper. The &quot;Tver Chronicle&quot; mentions them in the year 883, mentioning their fight against Askold and Dir. A number of manuscripts mention in the year 885 that they fought with Oleg of Novgorod. They are mentioned as taking part in Oleg&#x27;s expeditions in 907 and in Igor&#x27;s expeditions in 944, the latter year being the last reference to Tivertsi in early East Slavic manuscripts.

At the beginning of the 10th century, the tribe became part of the Kievan Rus. Starting in the mid-10th century, the Tivertsi frequently fought against the neighbouring Pechenegs and Cumans. In 12th and 13th centuries, some lands of the Tivertsi were part of the Kingdom of Galicia and later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. 

==Settlements==
Several settlements of Tivertsi are now archaeological sites in Ukraine and Republic of Moldova (Alcedar, Echimăuţi, Rudi and others). According to Romanian and Moldovan researchers, Tivertsi were a Romanic-Slavic population dwelling along the Dniester river.

Some scholars agree that the name of the town of Tyvriv (on the right bank of Southern Buh river) in Ukraine´s Vinnytsia oblast stems from the tribe of Tivertsi, who lived in that very area. Likewise, the name of west Ukraine&#x27;s town of Kivertsi is also associated with this tribe. It is also presumed that Kamyanets-Podilsky on the Dniester was the tribal center of Tyvertsi.

<doc id="1132867" wikidata="Q2508477" url="?curid=1132867" title="Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tai">
<text>Sulṭān Hāshim Aḥmad Muḥammad al-Ṭāʾī (; 1945 – 19 July 2020) was an Iraqi military officer, who served as Minister of Defense under Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. Considered one of Iraq&#x27;s most competent generals, he was appointed to the position in 1995. During his over 30-year military career, Sultan commanded two brigades, three divisions, and two corps of regular army corps before assuming responsibilities as Minister of Defense.

==Career==
===Persian Gulf War===
Sultan served in the Iraqi Army during the Iran–Iraq War and later in the Persian Gulf War, signing the ceasefire that ended it. He survived several purges and became the highest-ranking general in the Iraqi Army. He was regarded largely as a figurehead in the Iraqi military without any amount of real control.

===Iraq War===
As the invasion of Iraq loomed, it was reported in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in February 2003 that Sultan had been placed under house arrest by Saddam Hussein, in a move that was apparently designed to prevent a coup. He criticized Qusay Hussein’s handling of the Iraqi Republican Guard, saying Qusay “knew nothing [about commanding military]. He understood only simple military things like a civilian. We prepared information and advice for him and he&#x27;d accept it or not.” Nevertheless, he continued to appear on Iraqi state-run T.V., to preserve a sense of normality.

Sultan was number 27 on the United States&#x27; list of most wanted former Iraqi officials. On 19 September 2003, after nearly a week of negotiations, he gave himself up in Mosul to the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). Dawood Bagistani, who arranged the surrender to Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, said Sultan was handed over &quot;with great respect&quot; and was with his family at the time. Bagistani said the U.S. military had promised to remove Sultan&#x27;s name from the list of 55 most wanted, meaning he would not face indefinite confinement and possible prosecution. &quot;We trust the promise,&quot; Bagistani said.

Special treatment for Sultan al-Tai could be an effort to defuse the guerrilla-style attacks that were taking a toll on American soldiers. Many of the attackers were thought to be former soldiers in Saddam&#x27;s army. Seeing their former military leader well-treated by the Americans might have encouraged them to lay down their arms.

On 24 June 2007, he was sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, his execution was not carried out because of public disapproval from Iraq&#x27;s president Jalal Talabani. In May 2018, Iraq&#x27;s Parliament speaker Salim al-Jabouri requested a pardon for Sultan al-Tai, citing medical reasons. He then was transferred from the prison in Nasiriyah to a prison in Baghdad.

===Death===
Sultan al-Tai died on 19 July 2020 from a heart attack in the Nasiriyah Central Prison.

<text>Gonna Make You Sweat is the debut studio album by American musical production group C+C Music Factory, released in the US on December 18, 1990 by Columbia Records. Following on the success of contemporaries Black Box and Technotronic, &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat&quot; was a worldwide smash, reaching number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&quot; reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks in February 1991. The song also reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top R&amp;B Singles, Dance Club, and Dance Singles charts, as well as number three on the Australian ARIA Singles chart and UK Singles Chart.

Subsequent singles &quot;Here We Go (Let&#x27;s Rock &amp; Roll)&quot; and &quot;Things That Make You Go Hmmm...&quot; both became top-five entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Reception==

The album received generally mixed reviews from critics. James Muretich from &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;From the title track to &quot;Things That Make You Go Hmmm...&quot; (a nod here to TV talk show host Arsenio Hall), the music is irresistibly infectious to anyone the least susceptible to dancin&#x27; the night away. C+C Music Factory cleverly snatch melodic lines from people like Suzanne Vega while also providing a few riffs of their own, especially those of guitarist Paul Pesco. The lyrics also avoid crotch-rap cliches. C+C Music Factory is destined to become this year&#x27;s dance hit factory.&quot; Marisa Fox from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;this high-energy album has all the makings of a dance-club hit.&quot; She added that it&#x27;s &quot;a lot of fun — and it does live up to its name.&quot; In a contemporary review, &quot;Select&quot; stated that &quot;For every might tune like the title track, there&#x27;s an over-long muddled &quot;What&#x27;s This Word Called Love?&quot; and &quot;the producers knack of building indestructible house beats is matched only by their inconsistency&quot;. The review concluded that the songs were over-long and have trouble sustaining interest.&quot;

<doc id="1132875" wikidata="Q4764950" url="?curid=1132875" title="Animal locomotion on the water surface">
<text>Animal locomotion on the surface layer of water is the study of animal locomotion in the case of small animals that live on the surface layer of water, relying on surface tension to stay afloat.

There are two types of animal locomotion on water, determined by the ratio of the animal&#x27;s weight to the water&#x27;s surface tension: those whose weight is supported by the surface tension at rest, and can therefore easily remain on the water&#x27;s surface without much exertion, and those whose weight is not supported by the water&#x27;s surface tension at rest, and must therefore exert additional motion in a direction parallel to the water&#x27;s surface in order to remain above it. A creature such as the basilisk lizard, often dubbed the &#x27;Jesus lizard&#x27;, has a weight which is larger than the surface tension can support, and is widely known for running across the surface of water. Another example, the western grebe, performs a mating ritual that includes running across the surface of water.

Surface living animals such as the water strider typically have hydrophobic feet covered in small hairs that prevent the feet from breaking the surface and becoming wet. Another insect known to walk on the water surface is the ant species &quot;Polyrhachis sokolova&quot;. The pygmy gecko (&quot;Coleodactylus amazonicus&quot;), due to its small size and hydrophobic skin, is also able to walk on the water surface.

According to biophysicist David L. Hu, there are at least 342 species of water striders. As striders increase in size, their legs become proportionately longer, with &quot;Gigantometra gigas&quot; having a length of over 20 cm requiring a surface tension force of about 40 millinewtons.

Water striders generate thrust by shedding vortices in the water: a series of U-shaped vortex filaments is created during the power stroke. The two free ends of the &quot;U&quot; are attached to the water surface. These vortices transfer enough (backward) momentum to the water to propel the animal forwards (note that some momentum is transferred by capillary waves; see Denny&#x27;s paradox for a more detailed discussion.)

== Meniscus climbing ==

To pass from the water surface to land, a water-walking insect must contend with the slope of the meniscus at the water&#x27;s edge. Many such insects are unable to climb this meniscus using their usual propulsion mechanism.

David Hu and coworker John W. M. Bush have shown that such insects climb meniscuses by assuming a fixed body posture. This deforms the water surface and generates capillary forces that propels the insect up the slope without moving its appendages. 

Hu and Bush conclude that meniscus climbing is an unusual means of propulsion in that the insect propels itself in a quasi-static configuration, without moving its appendages. Biolocomotion is generally characterized by the transfer of muscular strain energy to the kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the creature, and the kinetic energy of the suspending fluid. In contrast, meniscus climbing has a different energy pathway: by deforming the free surface, the insect converts muscular strain to the surface energy that powers its ascent.

== Marangoni propulsion ==

Many insects, including some terrestrial insects, can release a surfactant and propel themselves using the Marangoni effect. Hu and Bush report that &quot;Microvelia&quot; can attain a peak speed of 17 cm/s, which is twice its peak walking speed, using Marangoni propulsion.

Marangoni propulsion by a wetting arthropod is precisely analogous to a soap boat but the situation for insects such as water striders is more complex. Hu and Bush state that &quot;for nonwetting arthropods, the transfer of chemical to kinetic energy is more subtle, as the Marangoni stress must be communicated across the creature’s complex surface layer&quot;.

&quot;Velella&quot;, the by-the-wind sailor, is a cnidarian with no means of propulsion other than sailing. A small rigid sail projects into the air and catches the wind. &quot;Velella&quot; sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil, so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind.

<text>John Hiester (April 9, 1745October 15, 1821) was an American military and political leader from the Revolutionary War era to the early 19th century. He was a member of the Hiester Family political dynasty.

The brother of US Congressman Daniel Hiester (1747-1804), the father of US Congressman Daniel Hiester (1774-1834), and the uncle of US Congressman and Pennsylvania State Senator William Hiester (1790-1853), John Hiester was a Republican who was elected to the 10th United States Congress (March 4, 1807 to March 3, 1809) during the administration of President Thomas Jefferson.

==Biography==
Born in Goshenhoppen in the Province of Pennsylvania on April 9, 1745, John Hiester was a son of Daniel Hiester (1712-1795), a native of Germany, and Pennsylvania native Catharine (Schuler) Hiester (1716-1789). His parents were members of the Reformed Church of Goshenhoppen.

Residing at the family&#x27;s home in Upper Salford Township, which was located near what is now Sumneytown, John Hiester grew up in a world of privilege with his siblings. According to Hiester family historian Henry Melchior Muhlenberg Richards, the Hiesters&#x27; home was &quot;a fine, two-story brick mansion on the east side of the turnpike, close to Ridge Valley Creek&quot; that was &quot;sufficiently prominent to be noted on the map of Pennsylvania published by Nicholas Scull, the Province Surveyor, in 1759.&quot; In 1907, Richards described the home as follows:

A broad hall runs through the middle of the first story, on each side of which are spacious parlors; the second story is divided into bedrooms; above this is the roomy garrett of the olden time. Heavy eaves run along the gable roof, and a corresponding cornice forms the lower part of the gable. It was originally provided with a secret closet in which to hide plate in troublous times.

After completing his education in the public schools of the area, John Hiester entered the lumber business with his father in Berks County, Pennsylvania. He married Hannah Pawling (1747-1822) and fathered seven children.

===Military and political career===
During the Revolutionary War, Hiester volunteered for service with the Pennsylvania Militia. After serving as a captain with the 1st Company, 4th Battalion under Colonel William Evans in 1777, he served as a captain with the 1st Battalion of the Chester County Militia that same year. After the war, he was commissioned as Major General of Militia.

Elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate during the early 1800s, he represented Chester County constituents from 1802 to 1806.

He was then elected in 1806 to the United States House of Representatives, and served in the Tenth Congress from March 4, 1807, to March 3, 1809 during the administration of President Thomas Jefferson. Hiester entered the House during the era of the Napoleonic Wars, and was involved with attempts by the president and Congress to persuade the belligerents to end their conflicts, including passage of the Embargo Act of 1807 and the Non-Intercourse Act (1809).

In 1816, Hiester joined with John Cochran, J.P. Helfenstein, John Ramsey, and W. J. Duane in advocating for the creation of &quot;an Independent Electoral Ticket&quot; in Pennsylvania. Their appeal to Pennsylvania voters was published in the October 26, 1816 edition of the &quot;Lancaster Intelligencer&quot;.

==Death and interment==
Hiester died in Goshenhoppen, Pennsylvania on October 15, 1821, and was buried at the Union Cemetery in Parker Ford, Pennsylvania.

<text>Maitland is an English and Scottish surname. It arrived in Britain after the Norman conquest of 1066. There are two theories about its source. It is either a nickname reference to &quot;bad temper/disposition&quot; (Old French, &quot;Maltalent&quot;; Anglo Norman French, &quot;mautalent/Mautalen&quot;; Latin &quot;malum talentum&quot;), or it may be a locational reference to Mautalant, a place in Pontorson, France. The Brittany connection is less likely than that with Les Moitiers-d&#x27;Allonne, near Carteret in the Cotentin. Mautalents continue to live in and near Les Moitiers-d&#x27;Allonne, and the early medieval charters link the Maltalents of England and Scotland with the Morville family – originating from Morville, near Valonges, and Roger de Mowbray, whose family came from Aubigny, also nearby. The name gradually mutated to Mautalent and then Maitland, with the latter spelling appearing around 1250 and becoming settled in the late 14th century.

The earliest public record of the surname in Britain, after the Battle Abbey Roll of 1066, dates to 1138 in Northumberland when Robert Maltalent witnessed a charter of Roger de Mowbray in Yorkshire.

The Clan Maitland is a lowland Scottish clan, the chief of which holds the title Earl of Lauderdale. The Earl&#x27;s coat of arms features a lion rampant with all its joints cut off, forming a pun on the old version of the name (&quot;Mautalent&quot; sounding like the word &#x27;mutilate&#x27;).

<text>Huskisson Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, which forms part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Kirkdale. Huskisson Dock consists of a main basin nearest the river wall and two branch docks to the east. It is connected to Canada Dock to the north and Sandon Half Tide Dock to the south.

==History==
The dock was designed by Jesse Hartley and opened in 1852. It is named after a former MP and Treasurer of the Navy, William Huskisson. Initially dealing in timber, it later traded in grain and provided berthing facilities for passenger ships on North American routes. The main basin was enlarged and a branch dock created in the 1860s to accommodate larger ships. The dock was expanded again at the turn of the twentieth century when two further branch docks were added by Anthony George Lyster.

===World War II===
On 3 May 1941 Huskisson Branch Dock Number 2 was the site of the explosion during Liverpool&#x27;s May Blitz, when 1,000 tons of explosives on board the ship were ignited during an air raid. Four people were killed and debris from the ship was strewn up to 2.5 miles away. The two ton anchor stock from the ship landed outside Bootle General Hospital, Derby Road, 1.5 miles from the scene.

===Late 20th century===
Largely destroyed by the &quot;Malakand&quot; explosion, Huskisson Dock was rebuilt after the War. The Tate &amp; Lyle Sugar Silo was built nearby, but on the opposite side of the Dock Road, and so was linked by an overhead conveyor.

Huskisson Branch Dock Number 2 was subsequently filled in and is now the site of a timber yard. Huskisson Dock remains in use, handling general bulk cargoes.

Up to the 1960s Cunard liners would berth mainly in Huskisson Dock.

Throughout the late 1970s the Nigerian &#x27;river&#x27; ships (named after Nigerian rivers) were regular visitors to Huskisson Dock. The Nigerian sailors were veritable traders, loading locally purchased, second hand household appliances onto ships for sale in ports of call in Africa, en route to Nigeria.

== Impounding station ==

The impounding station alongside Huskisson Dock was a pumping station used to maintain water levels in these &#x27;floating&#x27; docks.

<text>Merak , also called Beta Ursae Majoris (β Ursae Majoris, abbreviated Beta UMa, β UMa), is a star in the northern constellation of Ursa Major.

The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.37, which means it is readily visible to the naked eye. It is more familiar to northern hemisphere observers as one of the &quot;pointer stars&quot; in the Big Dipper, or the Plough (UK), which is a prominent asterism of seven stars that forms part of the larger constellation. Extending an imaginary straight line from this star through the nearby Alpha Ursae Majoris (Dubhe) extends to Polaris, the north star.

==Spectral classification==
In 1943, β Ursae Majoris was listed as a spectral standard for the class of A1 V. When improved instruments made it possible to identify subgiant luminosity classes for early A-class stars, β Ursae Majoris was assigned that class A0 IV. This was later revised to A1 IV. It is considered to be a mild Am star, a type of chemically peculiar star with unusually strong lines of certain metallic elements.

==Properties==
Based upon parallax measurements, β Ursae Majoris is located at a distance of from the Sun. It is a subgiant, a star that has exhausted the hydrogen in its core and is now cooling as it generates energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell outside the core. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is about 9,225 K, giving it a white-hued glow that is typical for A-type stars. It is larger than the Sun, with about 2.7 times the mass and 2.84 times the solar radius. If they were viewed from the same distance, Beta Ursae Majoris would appear much brighter than the Sun, as it is radiating 68 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity.

Observation of the star in the infrared reveal an excess emission that suggests the presence of a circumstellar debris disk of orbiting dust, much like those discovered around Fomalhaut and Vega. The mean temperature of this disk is 120 K, indicating that it is centered at a radius of 47 AU from the host star. The dust has an estimated mass of about 0.27% the mass of the Earth.

Beta Ursae Majoris is one of five stars in the Big Dipper that form a part of a loose open cluster called the Ursa Major moving group, sharing the same region of space and not just the same patch of sky from Earth&#x27;s perspective. This group has an estimated age of about 500 (± 100) million years. As the members of this group share a common origin and motion through space, this yields an estimate for the age of Beta Ursae Majoris. Two stars are known to be located in relatively close proximity: 37 Ursae Majoris at and Gamma Ursae Majoris at ; much closer to each other than these stars are to the Earth.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;β Ursae Majoris&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Ursae Majoris&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional name &quot;Merak&quot; derived from the Arabic المراق &quot;al-marāqq&quot; &#x27;the loins&#x27; (of the bear). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Merak&quot; for this star.

The Hindus called the star &quot;Pulaha&quot;, one of the Seven Rishis.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Northern Dipper&quot;, refers to an asterism equivalent to the Big Dipper. Consequently, the Chinese name for Beta Ursae Majoris itself is (, ) and (, ).

==In culture==
USS &quot;Merak&quot; (1918) and USS &quot;Merak&quot; (AF-21) are both United States navy ships.

<doc id="1132897" wikidata="Q6224236" url="?curid=1132897" title="John Byrne (playwright)">
<text>John Patrick Byrne (6 January 1940 – 30 November 2023) was a Scottish playwright, screenwriter, artist and designer. He wrote &quot;The Slab Boys Trilogy&quot;, plays which explore working-class life in Scotland, and the TV dramas &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; and &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;. Byrne was also a painter, printmaker and scenic designer.

==Early life and education==
John Patrick Byrne was born into a family of Irish Catholic descent in Paisley, Renfrewshire, and he grew up in the Ferguslie Park housing scheme. His mother, Alice McShane, was married to Patrick Byrne when he was born. He was, however, conceived from an incestuous affair between his mother and her father, Patrick McShane. McShane presumably sexually abused his daughter Alice for years. He did not know the truth about his parentage until he was informed by his cousin in 2002. He was initially angered by the revelation, but eventually reconciled with the truth of his lineage: &quot;I think he gave me that wonderful mixture of genes with his own daughter, the eldest of the family. I presume it&#x27;s what they do in unlettered places and lettered places. It&#x27;s traditional, and nobody speaks about it.&quot; His mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia, which Byrne attributed to the incestuous relationship. She was hospitalized several times throughout her life before dying in Dykebar Hospital at the age of 74.

Byrne was educated at St Mirin&#x27;s Academy, Paisley and then attended Glasgow School of Art, from which he graduated in 1963. Prior to art school, he worked as a &quot;slab boy&quot; at Stoddard&#x27;s carpet factory in Elderslie near Paisley, where he mixed paint used in the manufacture of carpets. He later returned as a designer following his graduation from art school. His time there inspired his &quot;The Slab Boys Trilogy&quot; plays.

==Career==
===Art===
Much of Byrne&#x27;s art was portraits, in a wide variety of styles ranging from fairly conventional oils to what are effectively caricatures. The full stylistic range was applied to his many self-portraits; the 2022 retrospective included 42 of these, and many are among his best known works. Other recurring themes include music; he painted several guitars for musician friends. 

At the start of his career, in an attempt to break in to the London art world, he sent one of his works to the Portal Gallery, claiming it was by his father Patrick Byrne, simply signed &quot;Patrick&quot;. A cover letter detailed his father&#x27;s hard, lonely life, and claimed that there were another 50 works by him at his small house in Dunoon. The hoax was found out, but the exhibition attracted some attention – in particular from the Beatles, who approached him to design the cover of their self-titled 1968 album. They decided against using his work, but it was subsequently used for the 1980 compilation &quot;The Beatles Ballads&quot;. Up until his death, he frequently signed his works with the name Patrick, most notably, &quot;The American Boy&quot;, completed in 1971.

He started work in the theatre in 1972, working on Billy Connolly&#x27;s &quot;The Great Northern Welly Boot Show&quot; and then as a house designer for the 7:84 Scotland theatre company. 

From 1964 until 1966 Byrne designed jackets for Penguin Books. Having had his work rejected by various galleries, Byrne had success following an exhibition of works at London&#x27;s Portal Gallery in 1967. Painting under the pseudonym of &quot;Patrick&quot;, Byrne claimed the dream-like paintings were created by his father, an alleged self-taught painter of &quot;&quot; images. Byrne&#x27;s career as a professional painter started in 1968, when he left Stoddard&#x27;s.

As well as designing the scenery for his own plays Byrne, in collaboration with director Robin Lefevre, also designed the settings for Snoo Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (Bush 1982) and Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (Apollo Theatre 1983).

Some of Byrne&#x27;s best-known art works in their day were the album covers he created for friend Gerry Rafferty and his former bands the Humblebums and Stealers Wheel, among them the covers for &quot;City to City&quot; and &quot;Night Owl&quot;.

Byrne had an unsuccessful exhibition of his artistic work in 1975 and subsequently kept his work from public view. He began exhibiting again in 1991, with several subsequent exhibitions. He became a member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 2007.

He illustrated &quot;Selected Stories&quot; by James Kelman, winner of the 1994 Booker Prize. Several of his paintings hang in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, including portraits of Robbie Coltrane, Billy Connolly, Tilda Swinton (the mother of two of his children), and a self-portrait.

He received a number of museum retrospective exhibitions, including &quot;John Byrne at 60, The Unsolved Artist&quot;, 2000, Paisley, Renfrewshire, &quot;Sitting Ducks&quot;, 2014, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une rétrospective&quot;, 2022, Fine Art Society, Edinburgh, and &quot;John Byrne: A Big Adventure&quot;, 2022, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow.

===Writing===
In the 1970s Byrne started writing his own work; &quot;Writer&#x27;s Cramp&quot; was a success at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1977 before transferring to London.

The following year he wrote &quot;The Slab Boys&quot;, the first part of a trilogy of plays which premiered between 1978 and 1982 at the Traverse Theatre Club, Edinburgh. A fourth part was added in 2008. The main characters in the first part, &quot;The Slab Boys&quot;, generally the most popular, are working-class Glaswegian teenagers, and the play launched the careers of several young actors: Robbie Coltrane in Edinburgh, and in the 1983 Broadway production, Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Val Kilmer and Jackie Earle Haley.

His writing found much success in the 1987 BBC television series &quot;Tutti Frutti,&quot; starring Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson and Maurice Roeves, which chronicled the final days of a failing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band. The series received much critical acclaim, including winning six BAFTA awards, the one for Graphic design naming Byrne himself.

He followed this in 1990 with &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, a six-part series set in the Glasgow country music scene, starring John Gordon Sinclair, Ken Stott and Tilda Swinton.

Byrne created The John Byrne Awards.

==Personal life==
Byrne was married to Alice Simpson, whom he met in art school, from 1964 until their divorce in 2014. They had a son and a daughter together. During the filming of &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, Byrne began a relationship with Tilda Swinton. They lived together in London and later in Nairn, northern Scotland. Swinton gave birth to twins, a boy and girl, in 1997. They separated in 2004. He began a relationship with the theatre lighting designer Jeanine Davies in 2006, marrying her in 2014.

<text>The Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopaedic Dictionary (, abbr. ; 35 volumes, small; 86 volumes, large) is a comprehensive multi-volume encyclopaedia in Russian. It contains 121,240 articles, 7,800 images, and 235 maps. It was published in the Russian Empire in 1890–1907, as a joint venture of Leipzig and St Petersburg publishers. The articles were written by the prominent Russian scholars of the period, such as Dmitri Mendeleev and Vladimir Solovyov. Reprints have appeared following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

== History ==
In 1889, the owner of one of the St. Petersburg printing houses, , at the initiative of Semyon Afanasyevich Vengerov, entered into an agreement with the German publishing house F. A. Brockhaus for the translation into Russian of the large German encyclopaedic dictionary into Russian as &quot;&quot;, published by the same publishing house. Initially, it was supposed to be limited to the translation of this publication, but only with a more detailed presentation of issues related to Russia. It was supposed to release only 16–18 volumes.

The first eight volumes (up to the letter &quot;B&quot;), published under the general editorship of Professor Ivan Efimovich Andreevsky, were almost literal translation with a slight adaptation for the Russian reader. These volumes caused a lot of complaints about the quality of the translation, and the overall management of the publication also left much to be desired. So, the journal (&quot;Northern Herald&quot;) noted: &quot;There are too many significant shortcomings. There is too little effort, love, and, what is stranger, not enough impressive edition, both literary and purely scholarly!&quot; (1890, No. 4, pp. 76–77), and the journal &quot;Historical Bulletin&quot; added to this that the Encyclopaedic Dictionary was &quot;carelessly and unsatisfactorily compiled. The very language of the articles is heavy and in places wrong. The translation is immediately visible, and it is far from a professorial one, but a gymnasium, awkward, literal&quot; (1890, No. 5, p. 454). 

After the death of Professor Ivan Andreevsky, the editorial office was headed by Academician Konstantin Konstantinovich Arseniev and Professor of St. Petersburg University , which marked a new period in the encyclopaedia&#x27;s history. Starting from the 9th volume, the translated material fades into the background, there is much more factual and statistical material. Particular attention is paid to geographical articles, the editorial states: &quot;Russian cities are located absolutely everything, with the addition of more townships, villages and villages with over 3 thousand inhabitants or deserving attention.&quot; 

The &quot;Encyclopaedic Dictionary&quot; began to be published in two versions. The first, more expensive, comprised 41 volumes, the second, with a more modest design, of 82 half-volumes. Having broken its expensive publication by half, the company made it more accessible to a wide audience of readers, thanks to which the circulation was brought to a record for that time – 130,000 copies. 

Many prominent scientists and philosophers were invited to the editorial board: Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, Vladimir Sergeevich Solovyov, Semyon Afanasyevich Vengerov, Andrey Nikolaevich Beketov, Alexander Ivanovich Voeikov and many others. From that moment on, the encyclopaedia begins to replenish with original articles, and the primary attention is paid to issues related to the history, culture and geography of Russia. The displacement of translated articles by original ones and the appearance of new authors affected the very nature of the publication: from a trivial encyclopaedia it turned into a collection of the latest achievements and discoveries in all fields of science and technology. 

The Encyclopaedic Dictionary was published from 1890 to 1904, with 4–5 volumes published annually. The circulation fluctuated significantly, from 12,000 copies in 1890 to 25,000 in 1897. Semi-volumes 54 and 55, containing an extensive description of Russia (1899), were published in a circulation of 35 thousand copies. The large circulation determined the wide distribution of the dictionary on the market, despite the rather high price. 

By 1907, four additional half-volumes were published, edited by Vladimir Timofeyevich Shevyakov and Arseniev. This also included all the most significant of what, for various reasons, had been omitted in previous volumes or appeared after the encyclopaedia was published. The 82nd half-volume ends with the &quot;Portrait Gallery&quot; of the editors and employees of the &quot;Encyclopaedic Dictionary&quot;, comprising 300 portrait-prototypes: from the editor-in-chief to a simple typesetter. 

Simultaneously, in 1899–1902, the &quot;Small Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Brockhaus and Efron&quot; was published in three volumes; in 1907–1909, its second edition was published in four volumes.

In 1911, the &quot;New Encyclopaedic Dictionary&quot; was published, edited by Konstantin Konstantinovich Arseniev, which was supposed to cover the same circle of knowledge as ESBE, but in a more compact and modern processing. In 1916, because of wartime difficulties, the publication of the dictionary was discontinued on the 29th volume of the originally planned 48 volumes of this edition. 

The RNL contains proofreading copies of the 30th (&quot;Padalka&quot; – &quot;Perm diocese&quot;; incomplete, without beginning) and 31st volumes (&quot;Perm system&quot; – &quot;Poznan Grand Duchy&quot;). &lt;br&gt;

<text>Roy Dikeman Chapin Sr. (February 23, 1880 – February 16, 1936) was an American industrialist and a co-founder of Hudson Motor Company, the predecessor of American Motors Corporation. He also served as the United States secretary of commerce from August 8, 1932, to March 3, 1933, during the final months of the administration of President Herbert Hoover.

==Early life==
Chapin was born on February 23, 1880, in Lansing, Michigan, the son of Edward Cornelius Chapin and Ella Rose King. He attended Lansing High School. He enrolled at the University of Michigan, but left in 1901 to take position with Olds Motor Works in Detroit.

In 1914, Chapin married the former Inez Tiedeman, the daughter of George Tiedeman, former mayor of Savannah, Georgia (1907–1913). The couple had six children. One son, Roy D. Chapin Jr., would also pursue a career with Hudson Motor Company and eventually leading American Motors Corporation (AMC).

==Commercial interests==
Chapin was general sales manager of Olds Motor Works from 1904 to 1906. He then started E. R. Thomas-Detroit Company with Edward R. Thomas, and was its treasurer and general manager from 1906 to 1908.

Chapin headed the consortium of businessmen and engineers that founded the Hudson Motor Car Company in 1908. The company was named for Detroit merchant Joseph L. Hudson, who provided the majority of capital for the operation&#x27;s start-up.

Chapin was also behind the 1918 formation of the Essex Motors Company, a subsidiary of Hudson. Essex is notable for developing the first affordable mass-produced enclosed automobile in 1922. Because of the success of the inexpensive enclosed Essex Coach line, the American automobile industry shifted away from open touring cars in order to meet consumer demand for all-weather passenger vehicles. By 1929 Hudson-Essex reached 3rd in industry sales behind Chevrolet and Ford.

In 1927 he replaced Clifton as the head of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce.

In addition to his corporate interests, Chapin spearheaded the drive to build the Lincoln Highway, along with Henry B. Joy of Packard Motors. While Chapin viewed a system of professionally designed and built roadways as the greatest way to grow the automobile industry, he also saw the modern roadways movement as a way to secure long-range strength for the United States as a nation.

==Political activities==
After building Hudson into one of the most profitable independent American automobile manufacturers, Chapin left Hudson for the Hoover administration upon his appointment in 1932.

During his tenure as secretary of commerce, Chapin was unsuccessful in persuading Henry Ford to provide financial help to avoid the collapse of the Union Guardian Trust Company of Detroit. Ford&#x27;s refusal to aid the bank in averting a financial failure led to the Michigan Bank Holiday, an event that began a series of state bank holidays and ultimately to the passage of Roosevelt administration&#x27;s Emergency Banking Act of 1933.

==Death==
Chapin returned to Hudson in March 1933. His final three years were spent trying to save the company from the effects of the Great Depression. He died in Detroit, Michigan, on February 16, 1936. He was succeeded at Hudson by A.E. Barit. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.

==Legacy==

In 1927, Chapin commissioned noted architect John Russell Pope to design a residence for his family at 447 Lake Shore Road in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. Pope later designed the Jefferson Memorial, National Archives Building and National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Bryant Fleming landscaped the grounds which included 600-year-old yews imported from England. Mrs. Chapin occupied the residence until her death in 1956 when Henry Ford II and wife Anne purchased the property. Ford owned the estate until 1983 when he demolished the house and divided the land to construct condominiums.

In 1954, Nash Kelvinator acquired Hudson in a friendly merger. The resulting company, American Motors Corporation (AMC), continued operation until Chrysler acquired it in 1987. Chapin&#x27;s son, Roy D. Chapin Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of AMC and led the automaker to the acquisition of Kaiser Jeep Corporation in 1970. Chapin was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1972. His grandson, William R. Chapin, was named president of the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2010.

<doc id="1132925" wikidata="Q5326208" url="?curid=1132925" title="Earl of Belvedere">
<text>Earl of Belvedere (alternative spelling: &quot;Belvidere&quot;) was a title in the Peerage of Ireland created in 1756 for Robert Rochfort, 1st Viscount Belfield. The title and its subsidiaries became extinct in 1814.

==History==

The title was created for Robert Rochfort, an Anglo-Irish politician who had represented Westmeath in the Irish House of Commons. He was the son of Rt. Hon. George Rochfort, a politician and a descendant of the English settler Rochfort family. Robert Rochfort had already been created Baron Belfield in 1738 and Viscount Belfield in 1751, both also titles in the Peerage of Ireland. The first earl was succeeded by the eldest son from his second marriage, George Rochfort, who was also a politician. The titles became extinct upon his death in 1814.

During his life the first Earl commissioned Belvedere House, thought to be designed by Richard Castles but James Gibbs is most likely to have been the architect. It is still an admired piece of Georgian architecture and is now run by the Westmeath County Council. Robert&#x27;s achievement with Belvedere House could be considered marred by his spitefulness however, as he had a 180 ft tall &#x27;folly&#x27; built, purely to obscure the view to the house for his brother George.

===The Rochfort family without Earldom===
After the Earl&#x27;s death, his wife remarried and bore a son whom she christened George Augustus Rochfort Boyd. He chose to live on the estate in Westmeath. A descendant of the family, George Arthur Boyd-Rochfort, was awarded the Victoria Cross for service in France during the First World War. The village of Rochfortbridge in Westmeath was named after the grandfather of the 1st Earl of Belvedere – also Robert Rochfort – (1651–1727).

<doc id="1132929" wikidata="Q1176765" url="?curid=1132929" title="Michilimackinac">
<text>Michilimackinac ( ) is derived from an Ottawa Ojibwe name for present-day Mackinac Island and the region around the Straits of Mackinac between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. Early settlers of North America applied the term to the entire region along Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior. Today it is considered to be mostly within the boundaries of Michigan, in the United States. Michilimackinac was the original name for present day Mackinac Island and Mackinac County.

==History==

=== Woodland Period (1000 BCE–1650 CE) ===
Pottery first appears during this period in the style of the Laurel complex. The people of the area engaged in long-distance trade, likely as part of the Hopewell tradition.

=== Anishinaabe and the French (1612–1763) ===
The Straits of Mackinac linking Lakes Michigan and Huron was a strategic area controlling movement between the two lakes and much of the pays d&#x27;en haut. It was controlled by Algonquian Anishinaabe nations including the Ojibwa (called Chippewa in the United States) and the Odawa. The area was known to the Odawa as &quot;Michilimackinac&quot;, meaning &quot;Big Turtle&quot;. For these people, &quot;Michilimackinac is literally the birthplace and centre of the world&quot; and is where the Three Fires Confederacy took place.

The Anishinaabe had good relations with the Iroquoian-speaking Wyandot, who were the first group to establish relations with the French after Champlain&#x27;s arrival in 1608. The Anishinaabe used these relations to trade indirectly with the French. The French were the first Europeans to explore the area, beginning in 1612. After the fall of Huronia in the Beaver Wars, The Anishinaabe began to trade directly with the French, and started inviting French settlers to Michilimackinac.

In 1654, a large Iroquois force was attacked by the Odawa and Ojibwe as they tried to cross the straits near Michilimackinac. In 1658, the Iroquois attacked again, but were again defeated by the Anishinaabe. The French established trading posts and Jesuit Catholic missions. One of the oldest missions, St. Ignace Mission, was located on the north side of the strait at Point Iroquois, near present-day St. Ignace, Michigan. This mission was established in 1671 by the Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette. 

In 1683, under pressure from the Odawa, the French established a presence on the North side of the straits at the St. Ignace Mission in an alliance with the Anishinaabe against the Iroquois. Between 1670 and 1700, Michilimackinac flourished and became one of the central sites of the fur trade. Soon, French visitors reported vast summer markets taking place along the shorelines each year. Both natives and newcomers flocked to take advantage. Hundreds of Native Americans from around Lakes Michigan and Superior would make the voyage to the straits to meet French traders coming up from the St. Lawrence. In the words of a later French traveler, Michilimackinac became &quot;the landing place and refuge of all the savages who trade their peltries.&quot; Consequently, Michilimackinac rapidly became the &quot;general meeting-place for all the French who go to trade with stranger tribes.&quot;

In 1715, the French established a fort and settlement on the south side of the strait. It was called Fort Michilimackinac. The fort became a major trading post, attracting Native Americans from throughout the northern Great Lakes. After Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War (French and Indian War), their colonial forces took over the fort and territory.

Fort Michilimackinac fell to an Ojibwa attack during the Native American uprising of 1763, sometimes called Pontiac&#x27;s War. It was reoccupied by the British in September 1764. In 1780, during the American Revolution, British commandant Patrick Sinclair moved the British trading and military post to Mackinac Island, which was held by the British for some time, and abandoned Fort Michilimackinac after the move. After the rebel Americans gained independence in the Revolutionary War, this site became part of a territory of the United States. The fort saw its only military action 17 July 1812 when Lieutenant Porter Hanks bloodlessly surrendered it to the British during the war of 1812.

Today, Fort Michilimackinac is preserved as a tourist site. Re-enactors portray the historic activities of the French and English. An archeological dig at the site is open for viewing.

<doc id="1132936" wikidata="Q2330052" url="?curid=1132936" title="Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg">
<text>also known simply as Billy Hatcher or Giant Egg, is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the GameCube in 2003. A port for Microsoft Windows was released in Europe in 2006 by Mindscape. The game received mixed reviews.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Billy Hatcher&quot; is a 3D platform game whose gameplay revolves around growing and hatching eggs to defeat the Crows. The player controls Billy, who cannot do much by himself aside from moving and jumping, but his abilities greatly expand while holding an egg. While rolling an egg, Billy moves faster and is more agile. He can also perform several techniques with an egg, such as egg dunking, slamming, dashing, and shooting.

===Eggs===
The game features 72 different eggs to hatch, most with unique designs. As Billy rolls over fruit collected from the world or dropped from enemies while holding an egg, the egg will grow in size and power. When the egg&#x27;s gauge completely fills, the egg reaches a maximum size and flashes, indicating it is ready to hatch. Billy can perform a rooster call to hatch fully matured eggs, which can hold contents such as helper animals, hats, and items. Certain eggs are required to hatch to progress through the game, as they are necessary to clear objectives or get past obstacles.

Eggs can be damaged by enemies, large enough eggs, and the environment. An egg&#x27;s damage is represented by cracks appearing on the egg&#x27;s meter in the corner of the screen. When the egg takes enough damage, it is destroyed and nothing hatches from it. Eggs can also be &#x27;lost&#x27;, i.e. put into positions or situations that the player cannot retrieve them from. In such cases, the egg will disappear from its position after several seconds of inactivity and will appear back at its nest at its smallest size. Eggs with a Sonic Team logo on them can be found and hatched in certain levels after collecting enough chick coins, holding animal friends of Sonic Team characters such as Sonic the Hedgehog or NiGHTS.

Eggs will grow at a faster rate depending on the size of the fruit collected. Some eggs are easier to hatch than others, and require less fruit than others. Eggs that contain items usually hatch faster than animals, with the exception of eggs which contain Game Boy Advance minigame download titles.

===Levels===
The campaign is divided into seven different zones, with each zone representing one region of Morning Land and featuring 8 missions. Every mission completed awards an &#x27;Emblem of Courage&#x27;, crucial to obtaining the Legendary Chicken Suit that Billy needs for the last battle against the story&#x27;s final boss, Dark Raven. For every zone except the last, the first mission takes place at night, involving Billy reaching the golden egg that imprisons the region&#x27;s Chicken Elder and freeing them by hatching them out of it like any other egg; destruction of this egg results in failure of the mission. All other missions take place at daytime, with some exceptions, and share another map distinct from the first mission&#x27;s map, with varying objectives. The second mission is about reaching the &quot;dark gate&quot; to battle the region&#x27;s boss to prevent the Crows from forcing eternal night onto such region of Morning Land ever again and unlock the next zone in sequence, although to unlock the final zone, Giant Palace, the player must complete its prior zone&#x27;s third mission in addition to the second one, which involves opening the Rainbow Gate to the said zone, where the final boss is immediately fought following the completion of its first mission there; the remaining 7 missions there are optional since the main storyline has already been resolved with the defeat of the final boss. 

The first five missions in a zone are playable only by Billy and the remaining three missions in the same zone can only be played by his friends as they are rescued; the sixth mission of a zone requires Rolly Roll to be rescued, the seventh mission of a zone requires Chick Poacher to be rescued and the eighth and last mission of a zone requires Bantam Scrambled to be rescued. 

The player is graded on their skill in completing the mission and given a rank letter, with an S Rank being the highest. While the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games use speed as a major factor in determining letter grading for completed stages, speed is less of a factor in mission grading for &quot;Billy Hatcher&quot;, which also takes into account combat performance, including longest attack combos performed with the same egg.

===Game Boy Advance connectivity===
&quot;Billy Hatcher&quot; supports linking between the GameCube and Game Boy Advance system. Using the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable, players can load games such as &quot;Puyo Pop&quot;, &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot;, and &quot;Nights: Time Attack&quot; on their Game Boy Advance systems after certain objectives are completed within the game.

==Plot==
The story begins within a peaceful fantasy world by the name of &quot;Morning Land&quot;, where the Chicken inhabitants live in peace and harmony. This world is shattered as Dark Raven and his army of Crows assault Morning Land, catching the inhabitants by surprise and shrouding Morning Land in a blanket of unnatural, eternal night.

Meanwhile, being late to meet with his friends due to oversleeping, the slightly mischievous Billy Hatcher races out of his house to go meet them. Upon arrival, Bantam tells Billy he is late, showing him a pocket watch in the shape of an egg. His friends, Bantam Scrambled, Chick Poacher, and Rolly Roll prepare to dish out a consequence on Billy, but they are stopped by the weak chirping of a chick. Two Crows that are looming nearby dive at the chick, as if they are finishing it off, but Billy intervenes, saving the baby chicken by fending the Crows off with a stick. The chick suddenly begins to glow, transporting Billy and his friends to Morning Land, with Billy ending up in Forest Village.

Billy is informed by Menie-Funie that the Crows are trying to take over Morning Land and will soon take over the human world. He is informed that if he does not save Morning Land, Dark Raven will bring eternal night, darkness will overcome the hearts of everyone, and the two worlds will be ruled by evil. Billy then goes and receives the Legendary Chicken Suit to begin on a journey to free the six Chicken Elders, which have been imprisoned in golden eggs by the Crows. Uri-Uri, the Chicken Elder of Pirates Island, reveals that Dark Raven is reborn every 100 years to try to bring eternal night. Once he has freed the Elders, defeated the six Crow Bosses, and opened the Rainbow Gate, Billy travels to the Giant Palace, where Dark Raven is trying to hatch the Giant Egg to receive ultimate power.

Billy battles Dark Raven, and once he defeats him, the Giant Egg hatches and grants Raven&#x27;s wishes, shaping him into a crow-shaped shadow demon dubbed Ultimate Raven. A second battle then ensues. Ultimate Raven attacks Billy, destroying the Chicken Suit. Afterwards, Billy must avoid his attacks until Menie-Funie speaks to him, telling him that he must not give up. Then the Courage Emblems he has collected form into the new and enhanced Sun Suit, imbued with the power of courage. Billy must then use this power to turn Ultimate Raven&#x27;s attacks against him.

Billy finally defeats Ultimate Raven as his heart explodes, completely ending his existence and return. The power from the Giant Egg restores true morning to the land below. Once he and his friends return to where they entered Morning Land, they return the Chicken Suits and return to their world. It seems that when they are leaving, Billy is saddened that he has to leave Morning Land. The four friends wave goodbye and they are transported back. Upon their return to the human world, Billy is a short distance away from his friends. They get his attention by laughing at him and he runs over to them joining the laughter, thus ending the game with a chicken feather slowly falling from the sky.

Producer Yuji Naka stated in an interview with &quot;IGN&quot; that eggs were chosen as the focus of the game to give the player joy from caring for and hatching eggs, and a feeling of anticipation &quot;because you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to come out of eggs&quot;. Animals were incorporated into the game to convey a mood of adventure, in contrast to the digital pet-based Chao creatures highlighted in the previous project, &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. The GameCube was chosen for development over the competing PlayStation 2 and Xbox because of its wide audience that Naka felt would appreciate such a family-friendly game. The game uses an engine that Naka called an &quot;evolution&quot; of the &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; engine. The game was exhibited at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003. Electronic musician Yukari Fresh composed the game&#x27;s main theme song, &quot;Chant this Charm&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40.

Critics praised the visuals and music, gameplay style, presentation and multiplayer mode, while citing issues with the physics, camera, and a simple plot. It was nominated in the 1st British Academy Game Awards for Best GameCube Game. The game was a commercial failure, only selling around 250,000 copies worldwide.

==Legacy==
Due to the game&#x27;s poor sales, Sega was reluctant to consider a sequel. In spite of this, Billy would go on to appear in various other Sega titles, including &quot;Sega Superstars&quot;, &quot;Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity&quot;, and &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot;. Billy and several characters from the game also appeared in &quot;Worlds Unite&quot;, a 2015 story arc crossover between the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Mega Man&quot; comic series published by Archie Comics. In December 2022, Sonic Team designer Shun Nakamura stated that he&#x27;d like to make a sequel for the game.

<text>Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten (&quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot;), often abbreviated GZSZ, is a long-running German television soap opera, first broadcast on RTL in 1992. The programme concerns the lives of a fictional neighborhood in Germany&#x27;s capital city Berlin. Over the years the soap opera tends to have an overhaul of young people in their late teens and early twenties, targeting a young viewership.

Based on the Australian format &quot;The Restless Years&quot;, which first was successfully adapted in the Netherlands as &quot;Goede tijden, slechte tijden&quot;, the German version took the scripts of the first 230 episodes, even though heavily rewritten, from the original. After the first year, &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; started using original material.

The programme started off with low ratings and was panned by critics. However the network believed in the success of the show and by the autumn of 1993, a serial killer storyline helped to improve the ratings, making &quot;GZSZ&quot; a success. It not only won its time slot but became also one of the highest-rated programmes, normally ranking in the Top 10 ratings of the day. In 2002, the soap opera reached its peak with over seven million viewers turning in for the 2,500th episode.

&quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; has tackled with issues like homosexuality, incest, rape, drug addiction, various crimes, breast cancer, bulimia, underage drinking, adoption and mental illnesses.

Frank-Thomas Mende and Lisa Riecken were the last original cast members when leaving the show in 2010. Wolfgang Bahro, who joined the show in February 1993, has become the longest-serving actor on the show since. He is described as having become a cult-like figure among soap opera stars, frequently noticed in public. Other long-serving actors are Daniel Fehlow, who joined the show in 1996 but has since taken several breaks, and Felix von Jascheroff, who&#x27;s part of the programme since 2001. Ulrike Frank is currently the longest-serving female cast member, being part of the soap opera in her current role since 2002.

&quot;GZSZ&quot; launched several successful careers in the music industry. The first being original cast member Andreas Elsholz. The most successful ones were Jeanette Biedermann and Yvonne Catterfeld, who both left the soap opera at the peak of their careers.

==Production==
The idea to establish a daily soap opera in Germany first came in late 1991. Production company Grundy UFA (now UFA Serial Drama) adapted the Australian format &quot;The Restless Years&quot; from Reg Watson. The programme was successfully launched in the Netherlands one year earlier. Production on the German adaption, officially now called &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot;, started on 23 February 1992. The first episode aired almost three months later, on 11 May 1992.

The programme was filmed in a studio in Berlin-Tempelhof for the first three years. In October 1995, production of the show moved to the Filmstudio Babelsberg. This required several set changes. In the beginning it wasn&#x27;t certain where the show was set. However, in its second year it was established that &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; is set in Berlin. The city has since been used to identify with the format; using several skyline settings in an episode.

Rainer Wemcken and Guido Reinhardt have the primary responsibility over the production, with Marie Hölker controlling the day-to-day production and overseeing the writing of the programme. The writing is controlled by a team of writers who are known to shift between the other Grundy UFA soaps &quot;Alles was zählt&quot;, &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot; and &quot;Unter uns&quot;. &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; uses a darker setting than the other three soap operas with sets appearing in modern, mostly dark, colors.

==Spin-off==
In 2000, at the peak of the programmes success, RTL wanted to launch a spin-off, called &quot;Großstadtträume&quot; (&quot;City Dreams&quot;), of the highest-rated soap opera. Actress Sandra Keller who vacated her popular role as Tina Zimmermann four years earlier was set to return to star in the new format. However negotiations between the network and Keller fell through. The network decided to recast the popular role. Ulrike Frank, who just starred in the canceled &quot;Mallorca – Suche nach dem Paradies&quot;, was cast. The character of Tina shortly returned to &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; with Frank in the role.

&quot;Großstadtträume&quot; premiered on 8 May 2000. Next to Ulrike Frank as Tina, the show saw the return of Victoria Sturm as Milla Engel. Laurent Daniels, who played Philip Krüger, switched from &quot;GZSZ&quot; to its spin-off. The programme was about the launch of a lifestyle print magazine, called POOL. It targeted an older viewership well below the age of twenty.

The network ordered 26 episodes. However the show wasn&#x27;t a success. After the premiere the ratings dropped dramatically and &quot;Großstadtträume&quot; was canceled after only seven aired episodes. The programme was never aired again since then.

===Parody===
In the German comedy series &quot;Freitag Nacht News&quot;, they had a sketch called &quot;Schlechte Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; (&quot;Bad Times, Bad Times&quot; or &quot;SZSZ&quot;) which was a parody of the soap opera. The sketch featured four men who lived together in an apartment, and suffered from severe depression. In every sketch, they kill each other but often kill themselves. Although three of the characters were unnamed, the fourth person was named Clive, whose face was never seen. He is always shown dead in every sketch, mostly hanging himself.

<doc id="1132943" wikidata="Q7562301" url="?curid=1132943" title="Sons of Confederate Veterans">
<text>The Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) is an American neo-Confederate nonprofit organization of male descendants of Confederate soldiers that commemorates these ancestors, funds and dedicates monuments to them, and promotes the pseudohistorical Lost Cause ideology and corresponding white supremacy.

The SCV was founded on July 1, 1896, in Richmond, Virginia, by R. E. Lee Camp, No. 1 of the Confederate Veterans. Its headquarters is at Elm Springs in Columbia, Tennessee.

In recent decades, governors, legislators, courts, corporations, and anti-racism activists have emphasized the increasingly controversial public display of Confederate symbolsespecially after the 2014 Ferguson unrest, the 2015 Charleston church shooting, and the 2020 murder of George Floyd. SCV has responded with its coordinated display of larger and more prominent public displays of the battle flag, some in directly defiant counter-protest.

== Purpose ==
Like the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the SCV has promoted the ideology of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, a deliberate distortion of the history of the Civil War and Reconstruction inextricably linked to White supremacy. That ideology or mythology told the story of &quot;faithful slaves and a virtuous South oppressed by Northern tyrants&quot;. One of its central tenets is that the Civil War was fought over states&#x27; rights and not over slavery. As of December 2024, the SCV&#x27;s website says, &quot;The preservation of liberty and freedom was the motivating factor in the South’s decision to fight the Second American Revolution.&quot;

The proclaimed purpose of the Sons of Confederate Veterans is &quot;to encourage the preservation of history, perpetuate the hallowed memories of brave men, to assist in the observance of Confederate Memorial Day, to aid and support all members, and to perpetuate the record of the services of every Southern soldier&quot;.

== Eligibility ==
Male descendants of those who served in the Confederate armed forces, or one of the constituent states, to the end of the war, died in prison or while in actual service, were killed in battle, or were honorably retired or discharged, are eligible for membership. Membership can be obtained through either lineal or collateral family lines. Kinship to a veteran must be documented genealogically. The minimum age for full membership is 12 years, but no minimum exists for cadet membership.

== History ==

=== Early years ===

Immediately after the defeat of the Confederacy, a Confederate memorial movement emerged. In the 1890s, this movement came to be controlled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the United Confederate Veterans (UCV, founded in 1889), and other, less important, organizations.

Forty delegates from 24 camps and societies from the various Southern states were called by the R. E. Lee Camp, No. 1, UCV, of Richmond, Virginia, to meet on June 30 and July 1, 1896, at the City Auditorium (present-day Virginia Commonwealth University Cary Street Gym), for the purpose of forming a &quot;national organization, adopting a constitution similar in every respect to that governing the United Confederate Veterans, and permanently organized under the name United Sons of Confederate Veterans&quot; (USCV).

The preamble to the USCV constitution reads in part: &quot;To encourage the preservation of history, perpetuate the hallowed memories of brave men, to assist in the observance of Memorial Day, and to perpetuate the record of the services of every Southern soldier&quot;. Its aims, objects, and purposes are &quot;not to create or foster, in any manner, any feeling against the North, but to hand down to posterity the story of the glory of the men who wore the gray&quot;. On July 1, the delegates elected J. E. B. Stuart, of Newport News, Virginia, son of the Confederate cavalry general, J. E. B. Stuart, Commander-in-Chief of the United Sons of Confederate Veterans.
Laura Martin Rose, a member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and propagandist for the Ku Klux Klan, received an endorsement by resolution (&quot;without a dissenting voice&quot;) of her 1914 book &quot;The Ku Klux Klan or Invisible Empire&quot; from the Sons of Confederate Veterans during the May 1914 SCV Reunion in Jacksonville, Florida, along with a SCV commitment to &quot;have it placed into the schools throughout the South.&quot;

In 1919, the SCV joined forces with the bigger and more active United Daughters of the Confederacy and the United Confederate Veterans in the so-called Rutherford Committee aiming at controlling the history textbooks used in Southern schools. The committee was named after Mildred Lewis Rutherford, the prominent historian of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

=== Constitutional crisis ===
In the 1990s, internal disagreements arose over the purpose of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. A traditionalist wing wanted to focus on &quot;maintaining gravestones, erecting monuments and studying Civil War history&quot;, while a more activist wing sought to increase efforts toward &quot;fight[ing] for the right to display Confederate symbols everywhere from schools to statehouses&quot;. These activists advocated &quot;picketing, aggressive lobbying, issue campaigning, and lawsuits&quot; to prevent &quot;heritage violations&quot;, which the group defines as &quot;any attack upon our Confederate heritage, or the flags, monuments, and symbols which represent it&quot;.

The group&#x27;s more activist members gained electoral support and were increasingly elected to its leadership positions. Members of the more traditionalist camp alleged that the League of the South had influenced their organization&#x27;s new direction. Indeed, one ally of the activist wing claimed that thousands of Sons of Confederate Veterans members were also League of the South members.

In 2002, members and former members of SCV formed a dissident organization, Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Soon &quot;about a hundred or so individuals and groups identified themselves on the Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans web site as supporting Save the SCV&quot;, co-founder Walter Charles Hilderman said in 2004; he declined to give more current membership numbers.

But most of the dissension had ended by 2003, and most members of SCV agreed with the heritage-preservation activities espoused by the new SCV leaders, Boyd Cathey reported in the &quot;Southern Mercury&quot;. One of those new SCV leaders, South Carolina politician and investment advisor Ron Wilson, served as Commander-in-Chief from 2002 to 2004. (In 2012, Wilson would be sentenced to prison for running a Ponzi scheme as part of his investment business; among those he defrauded were members of the SCV.)

In early 2005, the SCV General Executive Council sued to expel Commander-in-Chief Dennis Sweeney from office. The court initially granted the council temporary control of the organization, but its final decision returned power to Sweeney. Thirteen of the 25 council members were expelled from the council shortly after Sweeney regained control. Nine of the council members expelled were former commanders-in-chief, a status that heretofore had come with a life membership on the council. In February, Cathey wrote in the &quot;Southern Mercury&quot; that most of the members of SCV had united against the &quot;War on Southern Culture&quot;. By the SCV&#x27;s summer 2005 convention, activists firmly controlled the council. They severed much of the longstanding relationship between SCV and the more traditionalist Military Order of the Stars and Bars (MOSB). The MOSB, founded in 1938, had been closely involved with the SCV, sharing its headquarters since 1992 and co-publishing &quot;Southern Mercury&quot;. The MOSB&#x27;s Commander General, Daniel Jones, citing &quot;the continuing political turmoil within the SCV,&quot; moved the MOSB out of the shared quarters, ended the joint magazine-publishing enterprise, and separated the two organizations&#x27; finances. In 2006, for the first time, the two organizations held separate conventions.

For years the organization has been divided between racial extremists and those interested in history and genealogy.

== Controversies ==
=== License plates ===
Georgia: In 2014, the state of Georgia approved a battle flag specialty license plate.

Louisiana: In 1999, the state Legislature of Louisiana approved a SCV specialty license plate. Through May 2022, about 475 plates had been issued.

Mississippi: In 2011, the Mississippi Division of SCV launched an unsuccessful campaign to honor Confederate Lieutenant General and KKK Grand Wizard Nathan B. Forrest with a specialty license plate.

North Carolina: On January 1, 2021, the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles determined that license plates that included the Confederate flag were offensive and stopped issuing them. In March 2021, the North Carolina Division of Sons of Confederate Veterans sued to restore the symbol, saying the Department of Transportation had acted in bad faith and that the action was driven by a lack of understanding of the state&#x27;s history and hate for their inheritance as Southerners.

Texas: In 2013, the state of Texas denied a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate, a decision upheld in state court. That state court decision was overturned in Federal court, and the matter was ultimately heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans&quot;, which held that Texas was allowed to deny the request for a specialty license plate featuring the group&#x27;s logo.

Virginia: The Virginia General Assembly approved a specialty license plate for the SCV in 1999, but lawmakers forbade the group to display the Confederate insignia. The organization sued for the right to display the Confederate battle flag on the license plate, and won a 2001 injunction from a federal judge requiring the state to include the Confederate insignia. The injunction was upheld by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2015, after a white supremacist murdered nine African Americans at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe announced that the Commonwealth would phase out the state-sponsored specialty license plate, which was then displayed by more than 1,600 Virginians. The SCV challenged the governor&#x27;s authority to recall the license plates, citing the 2001 injunction. However, in August 2015, the court dissolved the 2001 injunction, citing the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Texas case. Hundreds of SCV members who had the specialty plates refused to remove them from their vehicles and exchange them for new plates even after the specialty plates ceased to be valid.

=== Jefferson Davis Highway markers ===

During the late 1990s, a granite marker stone for the Jefferson Davis Highway was removed from its prominent location in the city of Vancouver in Clark County, Washington, resulting in an outcry from the local Northwest Chapter of SCV. The marker stone was eventually placed outside of the Clark County Historical Museum.

As Vancouver city officials continued to press for the removal of the stone from any public property within the city&#x27;s boundaries, the chapter purchased land outside the nearby city of Ridgefield, Washington, during 2007. The chapter then placed the marker stone and a similar highway marker from the city of Blaine, Washington, on its property which faces the busy Interstate 5. The organization then surrounded the stones with large Confederate flags, thus creating a prominent display within an open space that the chapter named Jefferson Davis Park.

The chapter&#x27;s actions brought public outcries, but the governments of Ridgefield and Clark County could do little, as the park is located on private property. The park&#x27;s prominent location and events in other parts of the nation continue to make the park a local focus of strong emotions, which the white nationalist Unite the Right rally in August 2017 has exacerbated. The vandalism of the stones on August 17, 2017, raised concern for the park, as one marker was covered in black tar or paint and the other was covered in red. In October 2017, the city of Ridgefield formally asked the Clark County Historic Preservation Commission to remove the marker from the county&#x27;s Heritage Register. The Commission approved the city&#x27;s request by a 6 to 0 vote.

=== Marshall House plaque ===

In 2017, Marriott International removed a bronze plaque that had been placed years earlier by SCV within a blind arch near a corner of a prominent hotel in Alexandria, Virginia, that Marriott had recently purchased. The plaque commemorated James W. Jackson, who had flown a large Confederate flag on the roof of the Marshall House, an inn that Jackson had owned at the onset of the Civil War. The Marshall House stood at that time on the property that Marriott later acquired.

When the Union Army entered Alexandria during the morning after Virginia voters ratified secession, a Union Army colonel, Elmer E. Ellsworth, took down the flag, whereupon Jackson fatally shot Ellsworth. A Union Army soldier, who subsequently received the Medal of Honor for his action, immediately shot and bayonetted Jackson, killing him. Shortly after their mutually fatal encounter, Jackson and Ellsworth became heroes to promoters of their respective causes, who hailed them as martyrs during recruiting campaigns.

=== Confederate flag installations ===
The SCV took a more active approach after both the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, and moves by some municipalities to remove Confederate monuments and flags from public places because of their racist symbolism and historical connection to white-supremacy movements. SCV began installing large Confederate battle flags or &quot;mega flags&quot; on private property overlooking major highways, a project they called &quot;Flags Across the Carolinas&quot;. In January 2018, the North Carolina chapter vowed to install one flag in every county. Antiracist activists, such as Roland Stanton, criticized the project. Stanton, president of the Durham branch of the North Carolina chapter of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said the Confederate flag: &quot;is a symbol of oppression, genocide and slavery&quot;. Stanton described the project as &quot;abominable and shameful&quot;, while acknowledging that the mega flag project activities were protected by the First Amendment.

In June 2020, a plane with a Confederate flag banner reading &quot;Defund NASCAR&quot; was flown over Talladega Superspeedway during the 2020 GEICO 500, protesting NASCAR&#x27;s recent decision to ban the display of the flag during its events. Sons of Confederate Veterans took credit for the flyover, arguing that NASCAR&#x27;s actions were a &quot;slandering of our Southern heritage&quot;, and &quot;nothing less than trampling upon Southerners&#x27; First Amendment Right of free expression&quot;.

=== Links with extremist groups ===
In 2020, College of Charleston history professor Adam Domby was quoted in the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; as saying of the Sons of the Confederacy: &quot;It has pushed from its founding a white supremacist narrative of history that celebrates white men and distorts the truth.&quot; In 2021, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;throughout its history, the SCV has been linked with white supremacist groups, and historically it has avowedly supported white supremacist groups&quot;.

Heidi Beirich writes, &quot;The conservatism of the scv&#x27;s [sic] membership helped the extremists in another way—it made the group disinclined to publicly admit to infiltration, to the point of suspending and threatening to expel some 300 members, including Hilderman, who called for an end to extremism in its ranks. The upshot of this strategy is that the scv is returning to its roots, which were firmly planted in the soils of Southern white supremacy.&quot;

Some SCV members, including several who hold high ranks in the organization, are also members of &quot;more explicitly racist&quot; organizations like the League of the South or took part in the 2017 &quot;Unite the Right rally&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2021.

== Relationship with SUVCW ==
SCV has a longstanding and friendly relationship with the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW). The Commander-in-Chief of the SUVCW attended SCV annual reunions in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2005, 2017, and 2023.The SUVCW cooperates with the SCV in preserving American Civil War graves, monuments, and markers.

== Buildings and sites ==
The General Headquarters of SCV operates the National Confederate Museum at the Elm Springs house in Columbia, Tennessee. At its 2018 dedication, an SCV vice commander said the museum &quot;will be out of the reach of the long arm of political correctness&quot;. George Washington University professor James Oliver said that the museum&#x27;s &quot;casting the Confederacy as a honorable force standing strong against Northern aggressors is a willful misreading of the historical truth that the institution of slavery was at the core of the Civil War&quot;.

The SCV also own and maintain the Nathan Bedford Forrest Boyhood Home in Chapel Hill where the future Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard spent parts of his childhood.

==Notable members==
Notable members of the organization include former President Harry S. Truman, former senators Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms, Absalom Willis Robertson, political commentator Pat Buchanan, and actor Clint Eastwood.

According to Heidi Beirich, William D. McCain is regarded within the SCV as its true founder. McCain, who remained a steadfast segregationist throughout his tenure, was Adjutant-in-Chief of the organization from 1953 to 1993. While he occupied this office he was also president of the University of Southern Mississippi and director of the Mississippi Archives. He never ceased to defend the Confederacy and its politics, and controlled the SCV &quot;with an iron fist&quot; until the late 1980s. He opposed the civil rights movement, claiming in a speech he gave in 1960 that &quot;The Negroes prefer that control of the government remain in the white man&#x27;s hands&quot;, and strived to prevent blacks from attending the University of Southern Mississippi.

<doc id="1132945" wikidata="Q3795983" url="?curid=1132945" title="Sabbath's Theater">
<text>Sabbath&#x27;s Theater is a novel by Philip Roth about the exploits of 64-year-old Mickey Sabbath. It won the 1995 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. The cover is a detail of &quot;Sailor and Girl&quot; (1925) by German painter Otto Dix.

==Summary and themes==

Mickey Sabbath (modeled after American Jewish painter R.B. Kitaj) is an unproductive, out-of-work, former puppeteer with a strong affinity for prostitutes, adultery, and the casual sexual encounter. Sabbath takes great pleasure in his status as the prototypical &quot;dirty old man.&quot; He takes an equal pleasure in manipulating the people around him, primarily women—in a sense, they play the same role as his puppets. The loss of a decades-long wingman—the equally depraved Drenka—precipitates a crisis in a life he has long considered an utter failure. Sabbath wonders whether he should simply take his own life, thereby heeding the advice of the ghost of his departed mother, a frequent visitor who urges suicide as the fitting end for his failed life.

==Reception==

Literary critic Harold Bloom has declared &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot; Roth&#x27;s &quot;masterwork.&quot; Prominent literary critic James Wood told &quot;The Morning News&quot;, &quot;I am a great fan of &quot;Sabbath’s Theater&quot;, it was an extraordinary book.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani found it hard to finish and &quot;distasteful and disingenuous&quot;.

It won the National Book Award for fiction—thirty-five years after Roth&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Goodbye Columbus&quot; won the same award (1960). It was also a finalist for the 1996 Pulitzer Prize.

After Roth&#x27;s passing, the &quot;New York Times&quot; asked several prominent authors to name their favorite Roth book. Claire Messud picked &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot;, writing: &quot;The novel, outrageous when it was first published is all but inconceivable today; which is part of what makes it literarily important. Roth fearlessly embraces the ugliness of the aging degenerate, with Dostoevskian zeal. He manages to do so with such wit and in such pyrotechnic prose that this reader, at least, doesn’t hurl the book across the room.&quot;

==Stage version==

In 2023, the Signature Theatre Company put on a stage version of &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot; at the Romulus Linney Courtyard Theatre of the Pershing Square Signature Center, an off-Broadway theater. The play was adapted from Roth&#x27;s novel by Ariel Levy and John Turturro, with Turturro starring as Mickey Sabbath. The play was directed by Jo Bonney.

<doc id="1132947" wikidata="Q2350831" url="?curid=1132947" title="Planetary phase">
<text>A planetary phase is a certain portion of a planet&#x27;s area that reflects sunlight as viewed from a given vantage point, as well as the period of time during which it occurs. The phase is determined by the phase angle, which is the angle between the planet, the Sun and the Earth. 

==Inferior planets==
The two inferior planets, Mercury and Venus, which have orbits that are smaller than the Earth&#x27;s, exhibit the full range of phases as does the Moon, when seen through a telescope. Their phases are &quot;full&quot; when they are at superior conjunction, on the far side of the Sun as seen from the Earth. It is possible to see them at these times, since their orbits are not exactly in the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit, so they usually appear to pass slightly above or below the Sun in the sky. Seeing them from the Earth&#x27;s surface is difficult, because of sunlight scattered in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, but observers in space can see them easily if direct sunlight is blocked from reaching the observer&#x27;s eyes. The planets&#x27; phases are &quot;new&quot; when they are at inferior conjunction, passing more or less between the Sun and the Earth. Sometimes they appear to cross the solar disk, which is called a transit of the planet. At intermediate points on their orbits, these planets exhibit the full range of crescent and gibbous phases.

==Superior planets==
The superior planets, orbiting outside the Earth&#x27;s orbit, do not exhibit a full range of phases since their maximum phase angles are smaller than 90°. Mars often appears significantly gibbous, it has a maximum phase angle of 45°. Jupiter has a maximum phase angle of 11.1° and Saturn of 6°, so their phases are almost always full.

<doc id="1132950" wikidata="Q521269" url="?curid=1132950" title="Grafton, Wiltshire">
<text>Grafton is a civil parish in Wiltshire, England, in the Vale of Pewsey about southeast of Marlborough. Its main settlement is the village of East Grafton, on the A338 Burbage - Hungerford road; the parish includes the village of Wilton (not to be confused with the town of Wilton near Salisbury) and the hamlets of West Grafton, Marten and Wexcombe.

The parish is within the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, while Marten lies under the northwest edge of the Hampshire Downs.

==History==
Prehistoric earthworks in the parish include the long barrow known as Tow Barrow, on Wexcombe Down, south of Wexcombe. Neolithic pottery was found in 1914 when the site was partially excavated by Crawford and Hooton.

Marten is one of several possible sites for the murder of Cynewulf of Wessex in 786, and one of several suggested sites for the Battle of Marton in 871, in which Æthelred of Wessex suffered a defeat by the Viking army.

A Roman road between Cirencester and Winchester passes Wilton and Marten. The area was part of the ancient parish of Great Bedwyn, formed from a large estate called Bedwyn which was recorded in 968. The 1086 Domesday Book recorded 16 households at (East) Grafton and six at Marten.

Earthworks at Marten, including evidence of a moat, are listed as a deserted medieval village. The manor farmhouses at West Grafton and Wilton are from the 17th century; Wexcombe Manor is from the 18th.

The southern half of Great Bedwyn parish (south of the railway) became a separate ecclesiastical district in 1844, when the church was built at East Grafton; the civil parish of Grafton was created in 1895. Having no large settlements, the population of the parish changed little in the 20th century. The manor of Wolfhall was transferred to Burbage parish in 1988.

The parish war memorial stands at the approach to the church. A Celtic cross in granite on a tapering four-sided plinth, it honours 19 casualties of the first war and six of the second.

==Canal and railways ==
The Kennet and Avon Canal, opened in 1809, passes north of Wilton. Wilton Water was created by damming a spring-fed valley as a reservoir for the summit pound of the canal. Seven of the nine Crofton Locks are within the parish.

In 1862 the Great Western Railway built the Berks and Hants Extension Railway from Hungerford to Pewsey and Devizes, closely following the route of the canal; in Grafton parish the line is immediately north of the canal. The local stations were and . The line is still in use as part of the Reading to Taunton line, and Bedwyn station is still open.

The Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway was built northwards from Andover in 1882, terminating at Grafton and Burbage station which was on the south side of the main road at West Grafton; the next year the line was completed to Marlborough and Swindon. In 1905, owing to traffic for army camps on Salisbury Plain, the two lines were linked by the Grafton Curve and a bridge over the canal. This allowed trains to run between Bedwyn station and Grafton &amp; Burbage. The line and station were closed in 1961.

== Religious sites ==

=== Anglican ===

At first the parish church was at Great Bedwyn. East Grafton, Marten and Wilton each had a chapel of ease in the 14th and 15th centuries, and possibly earlier. Wexcombe had a chapel of ease by 1879, where services were conducted by the vicar of Tidcombe from 1899; it closed in the 1920s. In Tidcombe churchyard are 19th-century tombs of members of the Hawkins family of Wexcombe.

The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas at East Grafton was built in 1842–44, to designs by Benjamin Ferrey , on land near the south end of the village green which was given by the Marquess of Ailesbury. The style is called &quot;thoroughly Norman&quot; by Pevsner; in limestone ashlar and square rubble, it has a matching lychgate. The tall five-bay nave has aisles and a clerestory, and the short apsed chancel is described in Orbach&#x27;s revision of the Pevsner volume as &quot;boldly modelled with much shafting, and painted decoration&quot;. The decorative scheme was by Thomas Willement, who also made the west window. The north-west tower has an open bell-stage and a pyramidal roof with prominent gargoyles.

The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1986. The listing states that &quot;the whole is a triumph of a normally difficult revival style, and significant in its evolution&quot; and notes that the design is said to be based on the 12th-century , Thaon, Normandy. There are similarities to the church of St Mary and St Nicholas at Wilton, also completed in 1844.

The stone font is copied from Welford church, Berkshire. There is a ring of five tubular bells, hung in 1903.

A chapelry district was assigned to the new church in the year of its consecration, 1844, made from the southern part of Great Bedwyn parish. The district boundary was drawn along the canal in the north-west and through Wilton in the north-east, thus including West Grafton, Marten and Wexcombe. Today the parish is within the area of the Savernake Team, a group of twelve parishes centred on Great Bedwyn.

=== Others ===
A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built at Wilton in 1811, extended with a schoolroom in 1843 and improved in the 1860s. It closed in 1994 and is in residential use.

Primitive Methodist chapels were built at West Grafton by 1874 and at Wexcombe in the 1880s. By the 1960s, both were in residential use.

==Local government==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions.

== Amenities and attractions ==
East Grafton has village hall, the Coronation Hall, built in 1937 and renovated in 2009.

There is no school in the parish. A National School was opened at East Grafton in 1846 and improved in the 20th century; it closed in 2011 owing to falling pupil numbers.

Julian Orbach describes Wilton as &quot;a pretty hamlet of thatched houses in timber frame and brick&quot;. It has a pub, &quot;The Swan&quot;. On high ground above Wilton is a working 19th-century flour mill, Wilton Windmill.

Crofton Pumping Station, which supplies the Kennet and Avon Canal and has a 200-year-old beam engine, is just beyond the northern boundary of the parish. Its reservoir, Wilton Water, is a nature reserve.

<text>Cocoliche is an Italian–Spanish contact language or pidgin that was spoken by Italian immigrants between 1870 and 1970 in Argentina (especially in Greater Buenos Aires) and from there spread to other urban areas nearby, such as La Plata, Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay. In recent decades it has become more respected and even recorded in music and film. Traces of it may be found in Argentina, Brazil, Albania, Panama, Quebec, Uruguay, Venezuela, San Marcos, Cabo Verde and many other places.

==History==

Between 1880 and 1910, Argentina, and also Uruguay, received a large number of Italian immigrants, mostly poor country folk who arrived with little or no schooling in the Spanish language or Italian, although they were speakers of their own local languages of Italy.

As those immigrants strove to communicate with the local &quot;criollos&quot;, they produced a variable mixture of Spanish with Italian (Florentine) and other Italian languages, which was given the name &quot;Cocoliche&quot; by the locals.

The name &quot;Cocoliche&quot; originated in an 1884 pantomime adaptation by José Podestá of a theatre production titled &quot;Juan Moreira.&quot; One night one of the actors began an improvised exchange with a Calabrese stage hand name Antonio Cocoliche, which brought delight to the audience due to Cocoliche&#x27;s &quot;broken&quot; Spanish with Italian characteristics. This resulted in the introduction of a recurring comedic character named Francisco Cocoliche with that same way of speaking, influencing how the language of the Italian immigrants was viewed in Argentine popular culture. Thereafter, the name of Cocoliche came into Argentine vernacular to refer to the mixed Italian-Spanish language that the Italian immigrants spoke in Argentina.

Italian proper never developed in Argentina, especially because most immigrants used their local languages, and were not proficient in the standard language. This inhibited the development of an Italian-language culture. Since the children of the immigrants grew up speaking Spanish at school, work, and military service, Cocoliche remained confined mostly to the first and second generation of Italian immigrants, and slowly fell out of use.

=== Controversy ===
Cocoliche has sparked controversy amongst Spanish language scholars since its inception in the 19th century. In 1960, the philologist Américo Castro lamented the Italian influence on Spanish that it caused, stating that it &quot;has contributed more than anything to tear apart the language of Buenos Aires.&quot; Argentine Author Jorge Luis Borges directly argues with Castro&#x27;s essay in a letter, stating mainly that his idea of a Spanish language of Buenos Aires having to be as pure as that of Castile is folly. According to Borges, the Italian influences of Argentine Spanish do not take away from the dignity of the language. Furthermore, he references his travels throughout Spain, where he mentions that Spaniards do not speak better than Argentines even with a &quot;purer&quot; Spanish, meaning that if anything, Cocoliche&#x27;s influence has only strengthened the language.

Its status as a pidgin has been contested by linguists and philologists throughout the 20th century. Argentine linguist María Beatriz Fontanella De Weiberg posits that the language never became a pidgin due to the clear attempts of the government to integrate immigrants, leading Cocoliche to quickly disappear as immigrants rapidly adopted the culture and Spanish language of Argentina. She states it didn&#x27;t have the reason to remain and become a pidgin because it was not necessary to thrive in oppressive circumstances the way other pidgins have.

==Influence==
Following Cocoliche&#x27;s introduction into normal Argentine Spanish speech, and its subsequent disappearance as an independent language, it left many traces of itself in local language. It intermixed with existing Argentine Spanish characteristics like voseo and yeismo while providing a new intonation for the Rioplatense Spanish variety and its neighboring dialects.

Many Cocoliche words were transferred to Lunfardo. For example:

* (&quot;to eat&quot;) from Venetian , Lombard and Neapolitan ( in Italian)
* (fool)
* &quot;fungi&quot; (mushroom) -&gt; in Lunfardo: hat
* &quot;vento&quot; (wind) -&gt; in Lunfardo: money
* &quot;matina&quot; (morning) from Italian &quot;mattina&quot;
* &quot;mina&quot; (girl) from Lombard &quot;mina&quot; (&quot;exhibistionist and alluring woman&quot;, &quot;busty woman&quot; or &quot;prostitute&quot;)
* &quot;laburar&quot; (to work) from Italian &quot;lavorare&quot;
* &quot;minga&quot; (nothing) from Lombard &quot;minga&quot; (negative particle like &quot;not&quot; in English or in French)
* &quot;yeta&quot; (bad luck) from Neapolitan (to jinx)
* &quot;yira&quot; (to go for a walk) from Italian &quot;girare&quot;
* &quot;salute&quot; (cheers) from Italian &quot;salute&quot;
* &quot;fiaca&quot; (laziness) from Italian &quot;fiacca&quot;

Some of these words show a characteristic co-dialect evolution, for example in the case of &quot;manyar&quot;, the word &quot;manyar&quot; exists with the same meaning in Spanish even though it is considered jargon and not proper Spanish, being derived from Occitan and reinforced by the Italian .

<doc id="1132965" wikidata="Q2918277" url="?curid=1132965" title="Kyle, Ayrshire">
<text>Kyle (or Coila poetically; ) is a former comital district of Scotland which stretched across parts of modern-day East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire. It is supposedly named after Coel Hen, a legendary king of the Britons, who is said to be buried under a mound at Coylton.

==Geographical extent==

The area is bordered by the historical districts of Cunninghame to the north, Clydesdale to the east and by Carrick to the south. The Firth of Clyde lies to the west.

Kyle was the central of the three districts in the sheriffdom of Ayr (Ayrshire), which was divided naturally by its three primary rivers all running in a generally westward direction to flow into the firth of Clyde. The River Irvine forms the northern boundary of Kyle with Cunninghame; the River Doon established its southern boundary with Carrick. Additionally, Kyle itself was sub-divided into two parts. To the north of the River Ayr was &quot;Kyle Stewart&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Stewart Kyle&quot; or &quot;Walter&#x27;s Kyle&quot;), lands held by the FitzAlans (the future Stewart Kings of Scotland) since the 12th century. To the south was &quot;Kyle Regis&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Kyle&quot;, lands historically retained by the monarch under royal authority from the royal castle at Ayr.

Kyle was combined with Cunninghame and Carrick under Ayrshire County Council as a result of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889; this Act established a uniform system of county councils and town councils in Scotland and restructured many of Scotland&#x27;s areas.

==Kyle and Carrick District==

From 1975 to 1996 Kyle and Carrick was the name of a local government district in Strathclyde region, although the larger part of historic Kyle formed Cumnock and Doon Valley district. In 1996 Kyle and Carrick was constituted as a Unitary Authority, but renamed South Ayrshire.

==Council ward==

In local government the area of Kyle makes up a council ward, bordering the council wards of Troon; Prestwick; Ayr North and Maybole, North Carrick &amp; Coylton in the South Ayrshire Council area. It has three local councillors belonging to the Conservative Party, the Scottish National Party and the Labour Party. The area of Kyle includes the villages of Annbank, Mossblown, Tarbolton, Monkton, Symington and Dundonald as well as a number of smaller surrounding settlements such as Craigie, St Quivox and Loans. The area encompasses the northern portion of South Ayrshire excluding Troon, Prestwick and Ayr. It is bounded by the northern and eastern borders of the South Ayrshire Council area, which border North and East Ayrshire respectively. The southern border of the area follows the River Ayr between Ayr and the administrative border between South Ayrshire and East Ayrshire.

==Kyle Castle==

At Dalblair near Cumnock, at the confluence of Guelt and Glenmuirshaw Waters, lie the ruins of the once impressive 15th century Kyle Castle.

<text>Johann Nepomuk David (30 November 1895 – 22 December 1977) was an Austrian composer.

==Life and career==
David was born in Eferding. He was a choirboy in the monastery of Sankt Florian and studied at an episcopal teacher training college in Linz, 1912–1915, after which he became a school teacher. He studied briefly (1921–22) at both the Musikhochschule (where was a composition student of Joseph Marx) and the university of Vienna (where he studied with Guido Adler). He returned to Linz in 1922, where he acted as musical director of the Linz &quot;Kunststelle&quot; until 1924. From January 1925 until the autumn of 1934 he was a teacher at a local catholic school, founded and directed a Bach choir, and was organist at a Protestant church at Wels. He then became professor of composition and theory at the Musikhochschule in Leipzig (November 1934 – January 1945). From 1945 to 1947 he was professor of music at the Mozarteum, Salzburg, and finally, from 1948 to 1963, professor of theory and counterpoint (practically: composition) at the Musikhochschule in Stuttgart. At Stuttgart, he also directed the Bruckner choir (1949–52), the academy&#x27;s chamber orchestra (1950–53).

David wrote a number of orchestral works including eight symphonies (of which the fifth has been recorded, as have some other works including a disc of organ music,) several concertos including an organ concerto and three violin concertos, instrumental works including many for or with organ, and many choral works. His general style changed from the modal tendencies seen in his first two symphonies to the more acerbic though still tonal sound of the later ones.

David died, aged 83, in Stuttgart. His son, Thomas Christian David (1925–2006), was also a composer.

His pupils included Hans Georg Bertram (1936–2013), Seóirse Bodley (1933–2023), Johan Kvandal (1919–1999), Helmut Lachenmann (born 1935), Hans Stadlmair (1929–2019), Käte van Tricht (1909–1996), and Ruth Zechlin (1926–2007).

<text>Gabriel Hiester (1749–1824) was an American political and military leader from the time of the American Revolution to the early-19th century, and was a member of the Hiester Family political dynasty. A brother of John Hiester and Daniel Hiester, he was a Jeffersonian Republican who served in Pennsylvania&#x27;s unicameral Assembly, House of Representatives and State Senate, representing Berks and Dauphin counties.

He also practiced chattel slavery, according to early nineteenth century newspapers.

==Biography==
Gabriel Hiester was born in Bern Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania on July 17, 1749, the son of German immigrants Daniel and Rosanna (Hager) Hiester. He received his early education at the school associated with the Bern Church.

As an adult, he took up farming, married Elizabeth Bausman and fathered six children: Gabriel, Jonathan, William, Jacob, Mary, and Elizabeth.

According to early nineteenth century newspapers, Hiester enslaved at least two young Black men during his farming years. The &quot;Lancaster Intelligencer&quot; published the following advertisement of Hiester&#x27;s in its September 20, 1800 edition:

&quot;Ten Dollars Reward&lt;br&gt;RAN-AWAY from the subscriber on Wednesday, the 10th inst. a Mulatta lad, named SIGHE, about 19 or 20 years of age, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, stout made, light complexion and generally wears his hair queued. Had on and took along with him 2 shirts, 1 pair gray tow trousers, 1 pair do. stripe, 1 pair [two unintelligible words], small clothes line with leather, 2 wool hats, 1 pair shoes newly patched and soled, besides sundry other clothes which cannot be ascertained. Whoever apprehends said runaway and secures him in any jail shall have the above reward and reasonable charges if brought home.&lt;br&gt;GABRIEL HIESTER.&lt;br&gt;Barn township, Berks county.&lt;br&gt;September 11, 1800.&lt;br&gt;P.S. All persons are hereby notified not to harbor said runaway.&quot;

Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Aurora General Advertiser&quot; then published this advertisement of Hiester&#x27;s on the front page of its June 24, 1806 edition:

&quot;TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.&lt;br&gt;RAN AWAY from the subscriber, living in Berne township, Berks county, state of Pennsylvania, on the night of the 7th inst. a mulatto man named LISH, about twenty-five years of age, five feet 8 or 9 inches high, stout built, smooth face, has a scar occasioned by a cut on his instep; is fond of spiritous liquors and when a little intoxicated his eyelids appear heavy, and his tongue thick; a great boaster of his activity, strength and capacity for working; his wool is short, being fresh shorn excepting a little on the back part of his head — Had on and took with him, a dark brown cloth coat, swansdown jacket, ribbed velvet pantaloons, and other clothes not known.&lt;br&gt;Whoever takes up and secures said runaway, so that the subscriber gets him, shall have the above reward, and reasonable charges paid if brought home.&lt;br&gt;GABRIEL HIESTER.&lt;br&gt;Berne township, Berks county,&lt;br&gt;June 21, 1806.&quot;

===Political and military career===
A delegate to the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention on July 15, 1776 and an American Revolutionary War Patriot who served as a major with the Pennsylvania Militia from 1776-1777, Hiester spent the majority of his adult life in public service. 

On April 24, 1778, he was appointed as a Justice in the Court of Common Pleas. He then served as a member of Pennsylvania&#x27;s unicameral Assembly in 1782 and from 1787 to 1789. A delegate to the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention in 1790, he was subsequently elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving from 1791 to 1796 and, again in the House, from 1802 to 1804 before being elected to the Pennsylvania Senate, a seat he held from 1804 to 1812.

==Death==
Hiester died on his family&#x27;s farm in Bern Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania on September 1, 1824. He was seventy-two years old.

<text>Coil is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Toad the Wet Sprocket released in 1997. This was the band&#x27;s last album for 16 years, until 2013&#x27;s &quot;New Constellation&quot;.

As with previous albums, &quot;Coil&quot; was released under the Columbia Records label and produced by Gavin MacKillop.

==Track listing==
==Studio outtakes==

# &quot;This Is My Life&quot;
# &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot;
# &quot;Comes A Time (Band Version)&quot;
# &quot;Comes A Time (Acoustic)&quot;
# &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;
# &quot;Acid&quot;
# &quot;Won&#x27;t Let It&quot;

According to Glen Phillips, the version of &quot;Crazy Life&quot; on &quot;Coil&quot; was recorded in 1994 during the sessions for the band&#x27;s &quot;Dulcinea&quot; album. It was featured on the soundtrack to the 1995 film &quot;Empire Records&quot; but the band felt it deserved a place on a Toad album and fit this album&#x27;s themes, so they added a new organ track and cut new background vocals and had Tom Lord-Alge do a new mix. The intro fade-in was cut short and the BPMs were pushed up to make the song slightly faster. This has led many fans to believe it is a completely different recording, despite the credits in the liner notes pointing to different studios and engineers for the track which match the &quot;Dulcinea&quot; sessions.

<text>Race Rocks Ecological Reserve is a BC Parks ecological reserve off the southern tip of Vancouver Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Metchosin, British Columbia, Canada.

==Description==
Located at a narrow part of the Strait, the area covers of ocean, rocks, and reefs, but does not include the small envelope of land with the foghorn and the historic Race Rocks Lighthouse itself. That area is leased by the Canadian Coast Guard.

Because of the location in a high tidal current area, there is an exceptional variety of marine life to be found, including marine mammals, sea birds, fish, marine invertebrates, and marine algae and sea grass. It is a haul out area for the California sea lion (&quot;Zalophus californianus&quot;) and Northern/Steller sea lion (&quot;Eumetopias jubatus&quot;) and a birthing rookery for harbour seals (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;) and it is also the most northerly birthing colony on the Pacific Coast of North America for the elephant seal (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;).

==History==
The idea of protecting Race Rocks came about following a marine science project by the students of Pearson College UWC under the supervision and guidance of their teachers, Garry Fletcher and Marks McAvity, in 1978. They described an area of great biodiversity and ecological importance. In 1980, the rocks and surrounding areas were protected as an ecological reserve under joint BC Parks-Pearson College UWC management.

In 2006 and 2007, the Race Rocks Tidal Power Demonstration Project was installed. After a six-year period for experimental research, the tidal energy generator was removed.

<doc id="1132993" wikidata="Q1363696" url="?curid=1132993" title="Gunsmith Cats">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kenichi Sonoda. It was published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from 1991 to 1997 and was followed between 2004 and 2008 by a sequel series Gunsmith Cats Burst which included the same characters and situations. The series describes the adventures of young women fighting crime in Chicago.

==Plot==

Nineteen-year-old Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent operates the titular &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot; gun shop but also works as a bounty hunter, which is the impetus behind many of the stories. She is assisted in both activities by her housemate, and former prostitute &quot;Minnie&quot; May Hopkins. Rally is an expert combat shooter and marksman with an array of weapons, as well as a brilliant driver. May is an explosives expert, knowing the inner workings of and many uses of all manner of explosive devices. Teenage ex-burglar and lock-picker Misty Brown later joins the team and there is also Becky Farrah, a top, if expensive, source of information on underworld activity.

Bounty hunting has of course led Rally to make many enemies, most notably Gray, the leader of gangsters whose use of armaments, including bombs, has likened them to terrorists; and Goldie Musou, a leading figure in the Mafia who uses drugs to manipulate people to the point that they can be brainwashed into killing their nearest and dearest. Bean Bandit, a man who specializes in delivering illegal goods, often features as an alternate ally or enemy—depending on the behavior of his clients, most of whom are being hunted by Rally.

==Production==
After leaving anime production company Artmic to work as a comic artist, Kenichi Sonoda presented some of his story concepts and illustrations to Kodansha. These did not impress the editors but an illustration of two girls caught the attention of one of them, who suggested Sonoda develop a concept for it. Sonoda stated in an interview that the drawing was the genesis for the series. At the time Sonoda did not have any plans for the illustration but decided to expand his &quot;Riding Bean&quot; concept into a developed story. Due to licensing issues, Sonoda was originally unable to use the Riding Bean concept or character around the time he was creating &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot;. However, during the run of the series the rights were returned to him and he added Bean Bandit into the series. Although Sonoda was a fan of the Japanese police drama series &quot;Taiyō ni Hoero!&quot;, he decided the show did not fit his preferred Western style. The story is influenced by American gun-action movies such as &quot;The French Connection&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;.

Sonoda chose the Shelby GT500 as Rally&#x27;s car after realising that the cars in driving movies from the 70s were often Ford Mustangs. He researched the various models and selected the GT500 because it was the most powerful rather than any attraction to the car itself. When drawing guns, Sonoda would use a combination of magazines and his own replicas.

Character names were taken from American TV shows such as &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. The character of Minnie-May was the result of a compromise between Sonoda and the publisher.

==Media==

===Manga===
Written and illustrated by Kenichi Sonoda, &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot; began publication in the February 1991 issue of &quot;Afternoon&quot;, a monthly manga magazine published by Kodansha. The series ran for 76 chapters until the June 1997 issue of &quot;Afternoon&quot;. The complete series was published in 8 volumes between December 16, 1991 and July 23, 1997.

The series was adapted for publication in English by Studio Proteus and published by Dark Horse. Chapters were initially released as individual issues on a monthly basis from May 1, 1995 until August 15, 2001. Their release completely removed a scene where Minnie May performs oral sex on a man and another had blood stains on a bed removed, this censorship was done with the approval of Kenichi Sonoda. The individual chapters were then collected into 9 trade paperback volumes between October 1, 1996 and February 13, 2002. The series began serialisation in the British magazine &quot;Manga Mania&quot; from September 1996.

A four-volume omnibus edition of the series, &quot;Gunsmith Cats Revised Edition&quot; was published in Japan between July 22, 2005 and October 21, 2005. The fourth volume includes the manga and &quot;making of&quot; materials of &quot;Riding Bean&quot; and Sonoda&#x27;s early sketches and notes. This edition was then published in English by Dark Horse between March 14, 2007 and December 19, 2007. The English edition used the original Japanese format of reading from right to left for the first time in its English publication. It was sold shrink-wrapped and with an 18+ Mature warning on the cover.
A sequel &quot;Gunsmith Cats Burst&quot; was later released. Five volumes were released in Japan between June 23, 2005 and November 21, 2008. The English edition was published by Dark Horse between May 2, 2007 and April 14, 2010.

===Anime===
A three-part anime adaptation was created. This adaptation is an original story for the characters but includes several references to the manga storyline.

The OVA was licensed by ADV Films (currently known as Sentai Filmworks) who released the first episode in North America on February 20, 1996. There was a choice of either subtitled or dubbed VHS, as well as a bilingual Laserdisc. A special edition was also released of the subtitled version, along with a 40-minute making of documentary. ADV then chose the series for their first release in the United Kingdom. The first volume was released on June 3, 1996 as subtitled or dubbed VHS and also included the documentary.

A DVD release of all 3 episodes and the making of special was released in North America on March 27, 2001 before being rereleased as part of ADV&#x27;s &quot;Essential&quot; range with a lower price on April 13, 2004.

On December 3, 2017, AnimEigo announced that they acquired the license for &quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot;, and that they would host a Kickstarter campaign to produce a Blu-ray edition for the series. The Blu-ray shipped in 2019, with AnimEigo announcing that &quot;the Gunsmith Cats Explosive Edition Kickstarter was our most successful yet.&quot;

The anime adaptation was directed by Takeshi Mori. Although Mori was interested in cars, he had no knowledge of guns and had made an effort to research them for the production. He made sure the story was interesting to prevent the anime from focusing only on the guns and cars. The music for the anime was composed by former Weather Report drummer, Peter Erskine. During production of the anime adaptation, members of the staff made several trips to Chicago to scout locations, including visits to a Gun Shop and a Police Academy. During these trips the staff were able to handle and fire real guns for research, something not possible in Japan with its gun laws. A Shelby Cobra GT-500 was recorded in Hollywood for sound effects purposes, and almost all of the other sound effects were recorded using Foley.

The anime adaptation was broadcast on the Encore &quot;Action Channel&quot; in September 2000.

The series was also referenced in the Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;.

==Reception==
The series was nominated in the &quot;Best American Adaptation of Foreign material&quot; category of the 1997 Harvey Award.

In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson is critical of Sonoda&#x27;s depiction of women as &quot;thin-hipped plastic toys with pubic hair&quot; and some &quot;frankly pedophilic&quot; plot elements. However, he praises the &quot;skilled storytelling&quot; and describes the English localisation as &quot;excellent&quot;.

Mike Crandol of Anime News Network was critical of the final volume &quot;Misty&#x27;s Run&quot;, believing the previous volume would have been a better end and the &quot;true climax&quot; to the series. He highlights a lower quality of art in comparison to earlier volumes as a sign that Sonoda may have been losing interest in the series. However he notes that despite this, the story is still &quot;smartly executed and action packed&quot;.

&quot;Manga Mania&quot; described the anime adaptation as &quot;colourful, crazy stuff&quot; and &quot;a highly enjoyable feast&quot;. Comparing the manga and anime they noted that despite Sonoda&#x27;s attention to the cars and weapons in the series, the setting feels more like a generic American town than Chicago. However they praised the attention given to the anime adaptation&#x27;s more accurate portrayal of the city. In &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot;, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy call the adaptation &quot;good fun&quot; and observed the lighthearted approach to the series in comparison to the manga. They believe it deserved a version for TV. However they conclude that the low demand for pulp crime in the 1990s was a problem.

Mike Crandol of Anime News Network was largely positive about the anime adaptation but noted the simplified gunplay compared to the manga. He praised the attention ADV paid to the DVD package compared to their other titles and the quality of the English dub. In summary he called the anime adaptation &quot;an excellent introductory piece of anime&quot; due to the familiarity of the setting for those new to anime and called the adaptation a &quot;solid piece of fun filmmaking&quot;. In another review on the Anime News Network, a reviewer praised the series for looking and sounding &quot;like a gritty, grey suburb of modern Chicago,&quot; the impressive quality of the anime, action, and artwork. Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews praised the series for delivering on &quot;much of what its manga predecessor offers,&quot; having a &quot;fairly intelligent story, smooth animation, furious action, and continued humor&quot;. He only complained that the series is too short, hoping that more will later be in production.

<doc id="1133027" wikidata="Q3238376" url="?curid=1133027" title="Life Savers">
<text>Life Savers (stylized as LifeSavers) is an American brand of ring-shaped hard and soft candy. Its range of mints and fruit-flavored candies is known for its distinctive packaging, coming in paper-wrapped aluminum foil rolls.

Candy manufacturer Clarence Crane of Garrettsville, Ohio (father of the poet Hart Crane) invented the brand in 1912 as a &quot;summer candy&quot; that could withstand heat better than chocolate. The candy is so named due to its shape resembling that of a traditional ring-style life preserver also known as a &quot;life saver&quot;.

After registering the trademark, Crane sold the rights to his Pep-O-Mint peppermint candy to then-entrepreneur Edward John Noble for $2,900. Instead of using cardboard rolls, which were not very successful, Noble created tinfoil wrappers to keep the mints fresh. Noble founded the Life Savers and Candy Company in 1913 and significantly expanded the market for the product by installing Life Savers displays next to the cash registers of restaurants and grocery stores. He also encouraged the owners of the establishments to always give customers a nickel in their change to encourage sales of the 5¢ Life Savers. The slogan &quot;Still only 5 cents&quot; helped Life Savers to become a favorite treat for children with a tight allowance. Since then, many different flavors of Life Savers have been produced. The five-flavor roll first appeared in 1935.

A series of mergers and acquisitions by larger companies began in 1956. Life Savers is currently a property of Mars, Incorporated. In recent decades, the brand expanded to include Gummi Savers in 1992, Life Saver Minis in 1996, Creme Savers in 1998, and Life Saver Fusions in 2001. Discontinued varieties include Fruit Juicers, Holes, Life Saver Lollipops, and Squeezit.

In 1995, a Life Savers drink was introduced to compete with Snapple and Fruitopia, but it was quickly discontinued.

== History ==
Life Savers was first created in 1912 by Clarence Crane, a candy maker from Garrettsville, Ohio (and father of the famed poet Hart Crane). Clarence had switched from the maple sugar business to chocolates the year before, but found that they sold poorly in the summer, because air conditioning was rare and they melted. He saw a machine pharmacies used to make pills that were round and wafer-shaped, and thought he&#x27;d use those to make mints, which at the time were made square (because they were pressed in sheets and then sliced into squares). The machinery could also punch a hole in the center, and Crane named the candy after its resulting life preserver shape.

In 1913, Crane sold the formula for his Life Savers candy to Edward Noble of Gouverneur, New York for $2,900. Noble started his own candy company and began producing and selling the mints known as Pep-O-Mint Life Savers. He also began to package the mints into rolls wrapped in tin foil to keep them from going stale. This process was done by hand until 1919 when machinery was developed by Edward Noble&#x27;s brother, Robert Peckham Noble, to streamline the process.

Robert was a Purdue-educated engineer. He took his younger brother&#x27;s entrepreneurial vision and designed and built the manufacturing facilities needed to expand the company. The primary manufacturing plant for Life Savers was located in Port Chester, New York, a local landmark replete with a Life Savers motif cast into the cornice. Robert led the company as its chief executive officer and primary shareholder for more than 40 years, until selling the company in the late 1950s.

By 1919, six other flavors (Wint-O-Green, Cl-O-Ve, Lic-O-Rice, Cinn-O-Mon, Vi-O-Let and Choc-O-Late) had been developed, and these remained the standard flavors until the late 1920s. In 1920, a new flavor called Malt-O-Milk was introduced. This flavor was received so poorly that it was discontinued after only a few years. In 1925, the tinfoil was replaced with aluminum foil.

Noble promoted the candy at the cash registers of saloons, cigar stores, drug stores, barber shops, and restaurants. He had the candy placed, with a five-cent price, near the cash register.

In 1921, the company began to produce solid fruit drops. In 1925, technology improved to allow a hole in the center of the fruit candies. These were introduced as the &quot;fruit drop with the hole&quot; and came in Orange, Lemon and Lime, each of which were packaged in their own separate rolls. In contrast to the opaque white mints previously produced by the company, these new candies were crystal-like in appearance. These new flavors quickly became popular with the public. Four new flavors were quickly introduced, anise, butter rum, cola, and root beer, which were made in the clear fruit drop style. Other than butter rum, which remains in the brand&#x27;s lineup of flavors, these did not prove to be as popular as the three original fruit drop flavors. In 1931, the Life Savers &quot;Cough Drop&quot; was introduced with menthol, but it was not successful. In 1931, rolls of pineapple and cherry fruit drops were also introduced. As the public response proved positive for these, a new variety of mint called Cryst-O-Mint, made in this same crystal-like style, was introduced in 1932. In 1935, the classic &quot;Five Flavor&quot; rolls were introduced, offering a selection of five different flavors (pineapple, lime, orange, cherry, and lemon) in each roll. This flavor lineup was unchanged for nearly 70 years, until 2003, when three of the flavors were replaced in the United States, making the rolls pineapple, cherry, raspberry, watermelon, and blackberry. However, orange was subsequently reintroduced and blackberry was dropped. The original five flavor lineup is still sold in Canada. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, four new mint flavors were introduced: Molas-O-Mint, Spear-O-Mint, Choc-O-Mint and Stik-O-Pep.

During the Second World War, other candy manufacturers donated their sugar rations to keep Life Savers in production so that the little candies could be shared with armed forces as a tasty reminder of life at home. Soon after the war ended, the manufacturing license was withdrawn. In 1947, U.K.-based Rowntree&#x27;s—which formerly had been licensed to make Life Savers—started to manufacture a similar product called the Polo mint.

In 1981, Nabisco Brands Inc. acquired Life Savers from the E.R. Squibb Corporation. A number of early mint flavors, including Cl-O-Ve, Vi-O-Let, Lic-O-Rice and Cinn-O-Mon were discontinued due to poor sales. Nabisco introduced a new Cinnamon flavor (&quot;Hot Cin-O-Mon&quot;) as a clear fruit drop-type candy. This replaced the white mint flavor Cinn-O-Mon, which had recently been discontinued. The other original mint flavors were retired. A number of other flavors were also quickly discontinued, after Nabisco took over, in order to make the business more profitable. In 2004, the U.S. Life Savers business was acquired by Wrigley&#x27;s. Wrigley&#x27;s introduced two new mint flavors (for the first time in over 60 years) in 2006: Orange Mint and Sweet Mint. They also revived some of the early mint flavors (such as Wint-O-Green).

Life Savers production was based in Holland, Michigan, until 2002 when it was moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada due to significantly lower sugar prices in the new location. The company&#x27;s headquarters in Port Chester, New York, where Life Savers were made from 1920 until 1984, was distinctive. Although it has been converted to apartments, it still retains some Life Savers signage. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The rights to the Life Savers brand in Australia and New Zealand were sold by Nestlé to Darrell Lea in 2018. As a result of the sale, production was shifted from New Zealand to Australia.

== Trademark Litigation ==
The Life Savers brand has been subject to at least two cases of litigation defending the brand from accusations of trademark infringement, both in the United States and in the United Kingdom. In the U.S., in 1947, Life Savers filed suit against Curtiss Candy Company, claiming that the latter&#x27;s multicolored packaging violated Life Savers&#x27; trademark.

<text>Michael Moore Live, is a 1999 television show featuring political advocate Michael Moore, that ran for one six-part series. It was shown on Channel 4 and aired in the United Kingdom only, though it was broadcast from New York.

The show had a similar format to &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week. It was filmed around 7pm local time, which due to the time difference made it a late-night show in the UK. (EST is five hours behind GMT)

The live phone-ins all featured UK viewers, and questions were mainly about American policy at the time, e.g. gun control and the war in Kosovo. Each week, Moore was joined by guests, and one of the regulars was an illegal UK alien in the USA named Nigel (although his real name was James Horne). Throughout the show, he had to wear a rubber Queen Elizabeth II mask to hide his true identity.

<doc id="1133032" wikidata="Q295492" url="?curid=1133032" title="Bobby Jindal">
<text>Piyush &quot;Bobby&quot; Jindal (born June 10, 1971) is an American politician who served as the 55th governor of Louisiana from 2008 to 2016. A member of the Republican Party, Jindal previously served as a U.S. representative from Louisiana from 2005 to 2008, and served as chair of the Republican Governors Association from 2012 to 2013.

In 1995, Jindal was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. In 1999, he was appointed president of the University of Louisiana System. At 28, Jindal became the youngest person to hold the position. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Jindal as principal adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Jindal first ran for governor of Louisiana in 2003, but lost in the runoff election to Democratic candidate Kathleen Blanco. In 2004, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the second Indian American in Congress, and he was reelected in 2006. To date, he is the only Indian American Republican to have ever served in Congress. Jindal ran for governor again in the 2007 election and won. Jindal was re-elected in 2011 in a landslide, winning more than 65 percent of the vote. He was the first Indian American governor, and the only one until Nikki Haley became Governor of South Carolina in 2011.

On June 24, 2015, Jindal announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election. He suspended his campaign in November 2015, subsequently announcing his support for Marco Rubio. He finished his term as governor in January 2016.

==Early life and education==
Jindal was born on June 10, 1971, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to immigrant Indian Punjabi Hindu parents. He is the first of two sons of Raj (née Gupta) and Amar Jindal, from Punjab, India. His father is a civil engineer and graduate of Guru Nanak Dev University and Punjab University. His mother is a graduate of Rajasthan University and worked in nuclear physics at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh. Before migrating to the United States, both of his parents were lecturers at an Indian engineering college.

At the time of their move to the U.S., Raj Jindal was to be a doctoral candidate in physics. They left Malerkotla, Punjab in January 1971, six months before their son was born. Jindal&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a merchant from Khanpur, Samrala and his maternal grandfather was a Ferozepur banker.

The family settled near Louisiana State University. Jindal attended Baton Rouge Magnet High School, graduating in 1988. While in high school, he competed in tennis tournaments, started various enterprises such as a computer newsletter, retail candy business, and a mail-order software company. He spent free time working in the stands at LSU football games.

Jindal graduated from Brown University in 1992 at the age of 20, with honors in two majors: biology and public policy.

Jindal was admitted to the Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME), guaranteeing him a place at Brown Medical School. He did not pursue his Medical Doctorate. Jindal has been credited with leading Brown University&#x27;s College Republicans student group.

Jindal was named to the 1992 &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA Academic Team. He applied to and was accepted by both Harvard Medical School and Yale Law School, but studied as a Rhodes Scholar where he received an MLitt in political science with an emphasis in health policy from New College, Oxford in 1994. The subject of his thesis was &quot;A needs-based approach to health care&quot;.

==Career==
After completing his studies at Oxford, Jindal turned down an offer to study for a D.Phil. in politics, instead joining the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company. He then interned in the office of Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, where McCrery assigned him to work on healthcare policy; Jindal spent two weeks studying Medicare to compile an extensive report on possible solutions to Medicare&#x27;s financial problems, which he presented to McCrery.

==Early political career (1996–2003)==
===Foster administration===
In 1993, McCrery introduced Jindal to Governor Mike Foster. In 1996, Foster appointed Jindal as Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, an agency that represented about 40 percent of the state budget and employed over 12,000 people. Foster called Jindal a genius who had a great deal of medical knowledge. Jindal was 24 at the time.

During his tenure, Louisiana&#x27;s Medicaid program went from bankruptcy with a $400 million deficit into three years of surpluses totaling $220 million.

Jindal was criticized during the 2007 campaign by the Louisiana AFL–CIO for closing some local clinics to reach that surplus. Under Jindal&#x27;s term, Louisiana nationally rose to third place in child healthcare screenings, with child immunizations rising, and introduced new and expanded services for the elderly and the disabled.

In 1998, Jindal was appointed executive director of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, a 17-member panel charged with devising plans to reform Medicare. In 1999, at the request of the Louisiana governor&#x27;s office and the Louisiana State Legislature, Jindal examined how Louisiana might use its $4.4 billion share of the tobacco settlement.

In 1998, Jindal received the Samuel S. Beard Award for greatest public service by an individual 35 years old or under, an award given annually by Jefferson Awards.

At 28 years of age in 1999, Jindal was appointed to become the youngest-ever president of the University of Louisiana System, the nation&#x27;s 16th largest system of higher education with over 80,000 students.
===Bush administration===
In March 2001, he was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Planning and Evaluation. He was later unanimously confirmed by a vote of the United States Senate and began serving on July 9, 2001. In that position, he served as the principal policy adviser to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. He resigned from that post on February 21, 2003, to return to Louisiana and run for governor. He was assigned to help fight the nurse shortage by examining steps to improve nursing education.

===2003 election for governor===
Jindal came to national prominence during the 2003 election for governor of Louisiana. In what Louisianans call an &quot;open primary&quot; (but which is technically a nonpartisan blanket primary), Jindal finished first with 33 percent of the vote. He received endorsements from the largest paper in Louisiana, the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot;; the newly elected Democratic mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin; and the outgoing Republican governor, Mike Foster.

In the second balloting, Jindal faced the outgoing lieutenant governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette, a Democrat. Despite winning in Blanco&#x27;s hometown, he lost many normally conservative parishes in north Louisiana, and Blanco prevailed with 52 percent of the popular vote.

Some political analysts blamed Jindal&#x27;s loss for his refusal to answer questions targeted at his religion and ethnic background brought up in several Democratic advertisements, which the Jindal campaign called &quot;negative attack ads.&quot; Despite losing the election in 2003, the run for governor made Jindal a well-known figure on the state&#x27;s political scene and a rising star within the Republican Party.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2005–2008)==
===Elections===
====2004====

A few weeks after the 2003 gubernatorial runoff, Jindal decided to run for Louisiana&#x27;s 1st congressional district. The incumbent, David Vitter, was running for the Senate seat being vacated by John Breaux. The Louisiana Republican Party endorsed him in the primary although Mike Rogers, also a Republican, was running for the same seat. The 1st District has been in Republican hands since a 1977 special election and is widely considered to be staunchly conservative. Jindal&#x27;s campaign was able to raise over $1 million very early in the campaign, making it harder for other candidates to effectively raise funds to oppose him. He won the 2004 election with 78 percent of the vote.

Jindal was only the second Indian-American to be elected to the United States Congress, after Dalip Singh Saund was elected in November 1955.

====2006====

Jindal won re-election to a second term with 88% of the vote.

===Congressional tenure===
He was the second Indian American elected to Congress. He has reportedly lived in Kenner, Metairie, and Baton Rouge.

In 2005, Jindal criticized Bush&#x27;s budget for not calling for enough spending cuts. He warned of the growth of Medicaid saying &quot;Congress may act without them...there seems to be growing momentum that the status quo is not defensible.&quot; Jindal praised Bush&#x27;s leadership on social security reform, saying &quot;The administration has a lot more work to do to continue educating the American people about the very serious challenges facing Social Security.&quot;

In response to Hurricane Katrina, Jindal stated &quot;If we had been investing resources in restoring our coast, it wouldn&#x27;t have prevented the storm, but the barrier islands would have absorbed some of the tidal surge.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
* House Committee on Homeland Security
* House Committee on Resources
* House Committee on Education and the Workforce

He was made vice-chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Prevention of Nuclear and Biological Attacks. Jindal served as president of the incoming freshman class of congressmen, in 2004. He was elected to the position of House assistant majority whip, a senior leadership role. He served in this capacity from 2004 to 2006.

==2007 gubernatorial election==

On January 22, 2007, Jindal announced his candidacy for governor. Polling data showed him with an early lead in the race, and he remained the favorite throughout the campaign. He defeated eleven opponents in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, including two prominent Democrats, State Senator Walter Boasso of Chalmette and Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell of Bossier City, and an independent, New Orleans businessman John Georges.

Jindal finished with 699,672 votes (54 percent). Boasso ran second with 226,364 votes (17 percent). Georges finished with 186,800 (14 percent), and Campbell, who is also a former state senator, ran fourth with 161,425 (12 percent). The remaining candidates collectively polled three percent of the vote. This marked the first time that a non-incumbent candidate for governor was elected without a runoff under the Louisiana election system.

==Governor of Louisiana (2008–2016)==
===First term===
As governor-elect, Jindal named a new ethics team, with Democratic Shreveport businesswoman Virginia Kilpatrick Shehee, the first woman to have served in the state senate, as the vice-chairman of the panel. Jindal assumed the position of governor when he took the oath of office on January 14, 2008. At thirty-six, he became the youngest sitting governor in the United States. He is also Louisiana&#x27;s first non-white governor since P. B. S. Pinchback served for thirty-five days during Reconstruction, and the first non-white governor to be elected (Pinchback succeeded to the position of lieutenant governor on the death of Oscar Dunn, then to governor upon the impeachment of Henry Clay Warmoth). Additionally, Jindal became the first Indian American to be elected governor of any state in the United States. In a salute to the 2007 LSU Tigers football national championship team during his January 14, 2008, inauguration speech, Jindal stated in part &quot;...They revere our athletes. Geaux Tigers...&quot;

In 2008, Jindal was ranked one of the nation&#x27;s most popular governors with an approval rating of 77%.

Thereafter, Janice Clark, a state district court judge in Baton Rouge, declared that portion of the law enhancing the retirement benefits of Edmonson to be unconstitutional.
On June 27, 2008, Louisiana&#x27;s Secretary of State confirmed that a recall petition had been filed against Jindal in response to Jindal&#x27;s refusal to veto a bill that would have more than doubled the current state legislative pay. During his gubernatorial campaign, Jindal had pledged to prevent legislative pay raises that would take effect during the current term.

Jindal responded by saying that he is opposed to the pay increase, but that he had pledged to let the legislature govern themselves.

On June 30, 2008, Jindal reversed his earlier position by vetoing the pay raise legislation, stating that he made a mistake by staying out of the pay raise issue. In response, the petitioners dropped their recall effort.

Standard and Poor&#x27;s raised Louisiana&#x27;s bond rating and credit outlook from stable to positive in 2009. In announcing this change, the organization gave credit to the state&#x27;s strong management and &quot;commitment to streamlining its government functions.&quot; Jindal met with President Barack Obama in October 2009 where the governor pushed for increased federal dollars to cover rising Medicaid costs, speeding the construction of hurricane-protection barriers, and financing the proposed Louisiana State University teaching hospital. During a town hall meeting, Obama praised Jindal as a &quot;hard working man who is doing a good job&quot; for the State, and expressed support for the governor&#x27;s overhaul of the State&#x27;s educational system in the area of increased charter schools.

Jindal negotiated an agreement whereby Foster Farms, a private chicken processor, would receive $50 million in taxpayer funds to purchase a chicken processing plant owned by bankrupt Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride.

Some claimed there is a conflict of interest in that Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride founder Lonnie &quot;Bo&quot; Pilgrim contributed $2500 to Jindal&#x27;s campaign in 2007. Other contributors to Jindal&#x27;s campaign who benefited from economic development spending include Albemarle and Edison Chouest Offshore. Jindal however released a statement saying that this legislation saved over 1,000 jobs, serves as a stimulus to Louisiana&#x27;s economy, and had wide bipartisan support.
====Hurricane Gustav====
Jindal oversaw one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history (nearly two million people) in late August 2008 prior to the Louisiana landfall of Hurricane Gustav. He issued mandatory evacuation orders for the state&#x27;s coastal areas and activated 3,000 National Guardsman to aid in the exodus. He also ordered the state to purchase generators to provide needed power to hospitals and nursing homes without power. Government officials vacated hospitals and nursing homes and put the poor, the ill, and the elderly on buses and trains out of town. The evacuation was credited as one reason that Gustav resulted in only 16 deaths in the U.S. The state&#x27;s successful response to Hurricane Gustav was in stark contrast to the failed hurricane response system for Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Jindal received bipartisan praise for his leadership during Gustav. Jindal had been scheduled to address the Republican National Convention, but cancelled his plans in order to focus on Louisiana&#x27;s needs during the storm.

===2011 re-election campaign===
Jindal announced his intention to seek reelection in 2011. In the face of Jindal&#x27;s high approval ratings and big amounts of campaign funds, Democrats struggled to land a recruit of any substance. Running against four Democrats, a Libertarian and four independents in the jungle primary, Jindal received 66% of the vote in the blanket primary, thereby winning election in the first round.

===Second term===
In August 2011, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) awarded Jindal the Thomas Jefferson Freedom Award for &quot;outstanding public service&quot;.

On October 25, 2011, in preparing for his second term, Jindal tapped Republican state representative Chuck Kleckley of Lake Charles and State Senator John Alario of Westwego as his choices for Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives and Louisiana Senate President, respectively. Both were confirmed by legislators. Alario is a long-term Democrat who switched parties prior to the 2011 elections. In January 2012, Jindal elevated John C. White, the short-term superintendent at the Recovery School District in New Orleans, to the position of state superintendent of education.

In August 2012, Jindal declared a statewide state of emergency due to the threat of subsidence and subsurface instability that threatens the lives and property of the citizens of the state.

By the end of Jindal&#x27;s second term, he saw a marked drop in his state popularity and problems such as a budget deficit and cuts to public expenditure. He could not stand for a third term because the governor of Louisiana is subject to term limits.

====Tax system proposals====
In January 2013, Jindal released a plan that would eliminate the Louisiana state income tax, which he felt would expand business investment in the state, and then raise sales taxes in order to keep the plan revenue-neutral. Self-styled taxpayer watchdog and former legislative aide C.B. Forgotston correctly predicted that Jindal&#x27;s plan would fail to clear the legislature because of the higher sales taxes, the lack of needed support from Democrats, and the likelihood that the plan would not increase overall state revenues.

On April 8, 2013, the first day of the legislative session, Jindal dropped the plan after acknowledging some negative response to the plan from legislators and the public, but said he would still like the legislature to formulate its own plan that could end the state income tax.

====Energy plan====
Jindal announced, in September 2014, a six-point energy platform that would, among other things, open up energy production on federal land and eliminated proposed carbon restrictions.

==Retirement from politics (2016–present)==
In 2017, Jindal took a position as an operating adviser for Ares Management, a global investment firm based in Los Angeles.

==National politics==
===Speculation about 2008 vice presidential nomination===

On February 8, 2008, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh mentioned on his syndicated show that Jindal could be a possible choice for the Republican vice presidential nomination in 2008. He said that Jindal might be perceived as an asset to John McCain&#x27;s campaign because he has wide support in the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. If McCain had won the presidency, he would have been the oldest president ever inaugurated to a first term.

Heightening the speculation, McCain invited Jindal, Governor Charlie Crist of Florida, Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and his former rivals Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee to meet at his home in Arizona on May 23, 2008, according to a Republican familiar with the decision; Romney, Huckabee, and Pawlenty, all of whom were already well acquainted with McCain, declined because of prior commitments. The meeting may have served a different purpose, such as consideration of Jindal for the opportunity to speak at the 2008 Republican National Convention, in a similar fashion to Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, cementing a place for him in the party and opening the gate for a future run for the presidency. Speculation was fueled by simultaneous July 21, 2008, reports that McCain was making a sudden visit to Louisiana to confer again with Jindal and that McCain was readying to name his running mate within a week. However, on July 23, 2008, Jindal said that he would not be the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008. Jindal added that he &quot;never talked to the senator [McCain] about the vice presidency or his thoughts on selecting the vice president.&quot; Ultimately, on August 29, 2008, McCain chose then-Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate. While Jindal was given a prime-time speech slot at the party convention, he was not offered the keynote speech. During the presidential campaign, Jindal expressed admiration for both Senators McCain and Obama, and maintained that both have made positive contributions to the nation.

===Republican response to President Obama&#x27;s address to Congress===
On February 24, 2009, Jindal delivered the official Republican response to President Obama&#x27;s address to a joint session of Congress. Jindal called the president&#x27;s economic stimulus plan &quot;irresponsible&quot; and argued against government intervention. He used Hurricane Katrina to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. &quot;Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us,&quot; Jindal said. &quot;Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts.&quot; He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina.

The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as &quot;devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country&quot;, political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal&#x27;s Katrina remark as follows: &quot;[Jindal states that] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government should not be allowed to fail again, but that government...never works. That government can&#x27;t work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government.&quot; David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal&#x27;s mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating &quot;The one thing Republicans want to forget is Katrina.&quot; While Jindal&#x27;s speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style.

Jindal&#x27;s story of meeting Lee in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was questioned following the speech, as Jindal was not in New Orleans at the time. On February 27, 2009, a spokesman for Jindal clarified the timing of the meeting, stating that the story took place days after the storm. The opportunity to give the response to President Obama&#x27;s speech was compared by some commentators to winning &quot;second prize in a beauty contest&quot;, a reference to the board game Monopoly.

===2012 presidential election===

Jindal had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election. On December 10, 2008, Jindal indicated that he would likely not run for president in 2012, saying he will focus on his re-election in 2011 and that this would make transitioning to a national campaign difficult, though he did not rule out a possible 2012 presidential bid.
Speculation increased when Republicans chose Jindal to deliver the response to President Obama&#x27;s first address to a joint session of Congress.

The Jindal for President Draft Council Inc. PAC was formed in 2009 to raise funds for a future presidential run. Jindal has stated that he has no involvement with the PAC. In April 2010, while speaking at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, Jindal ruled out running for the Republican nomination for president in 2012.

In 2012, Jindal traveled across the country in support of the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket. Because Louisiana and other Deep South states voted heavily for the GOP, Jindal could hence devote his campaign time elsewhere. In August 2012, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that &quot;Bobby Jindal would be considered [for] and would likely take&quot; appointment as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services in a potential Romney cabinet.

After the defeat of Romney-Ryan, Jindal called for his party to return to &quot;the basics... If we want people to like us, we have to like them first,&quot; he said on the interview program &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;. As the incoming president of the Republican Governors Association, which had thirty members in 2013, Jindal questioned Romney for having criticized President Obama as having provided &quot;extraordinary financial gifts from the government&quot;. In reply to Romney, Jindal said, &quot;You don&#x27;t start to like people by insulting them and saying their votes were bought.&quot; Jindal said that his party must convince a majority of voters that it supports the middle class and the principle of upward mobility. He also criticized what he termed &quot;stupid&quot; remarks regarding rape and conception made in 2012 by defeated Republican U.S. Senate nominees Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.

===2016 presidential candidacy===
In November 2012, after the election, Jindal was featured in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article titled &quot;2016: Let&#x27;s Get The Party Started&quot;, where he was listed as a possible Republican candidate for the presidency in 2016. The article cited his fiscal and social conservative policies and his Indian American background, which would bring diversity to the GOP.

In 2013, with polls showing Jindal&#x27;s approval ratings in Louisiana falling significantly, some analysts wrote off Jindal as a serious national contender, though others pointed to Romney as an example of someone who still won the Presidential nomination despite poor approval ratings from his home state. In October 2013, Jindal told &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; that he was still mulling a 2016 presidential run.

On May 18, 2015, Jindal formed a presidential exploratory committee to determine whether he would run as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, and he announced his candidacy on June 24.

As of early September, Jindal was polling at 1 percent among the Republican primary electorate. On November 17, 2015, Jindal appeared on &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot; on the Fox News Channel, announcing that he was ending his run for president, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve come to the realization that this is not my time.&quot;

During his campaign, Jindal called Donald Trump a &quot;narcissist&quot; and an &quot;egomaniacal madman&quot;, but afterward said that he would support Trump because &quot;electing Donald Trump would be the second-worst thing we could do this November, better only than electing Hillary Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration&#x27;s radical policies.&quot; After the 2016 election, Jindal would go to support his campaign and presidency despite past critiques.

==Political positions==
===Abortion and stem cell research===
Jindal has a strongly anti-abortion voting record according to the National Right to Life Committee. He opposes abortion in general, but does not condemn medical procedures aimed at saving the life of the mother that indirectly result in the loss of the unborn child, such as salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy.

In 2003, Jindal stated that he did not object to the use of emergency contraception in the case of rape if the victim requests it. While in the House of Representatives, he supported two bills to prohibit transporting minors across state lines to obtain an abortion; the bills aimed to prevent doctors and others from helping a minor avoid parental notification laws in their home state by procuring an abortion in another state. He opposed and voted against expanding public funding of embryonic stem cell research.

===Same-sex marriage===
Jindal opposed the legalization of both same-sex marriage and civil unions. In Congress, he voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment to restrict marriage to a union between one man and one woman. He also voted against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. In December 2008, Jindal announced the formation of the Louisiana Commission on Marriage and Family.

Following the 2013 Supreme Court&#x27;s rulings on DOMA and Proposition 8, he said: &quot;I believe every child deserves a mom and a dad. This opinion leaves the matter of marriage to the states where people can decide. In Louisiana, we will opt for traditional marriage. How about we let the people decide for themselves, via their representatives and via referendum?&quot;

====Marriage and Conscience Act====
In May 2015, the legislature killed the measure. Four Republican members, Pete Huval of Breaux Bridge, Gregory A. Miller of Norco, Clay Schexnayder of Gonzales, and Nancy Landry of Lafayette, joined Democrats in killing the bill. Jindal responded by issuing Executive Order BJ-2015-8, (the &quot;Marriage and Conscience Order&quot;), which attempted to achieve the goals of the failed legislation. Johnson said he intended to re-introduce the measure in 2016.

===Government ethics===
He vetoed state legislation to increase pay for state legislators. However, the Louisiana governor&#x27;s office was ranked last for transparency in the United States both prior, and subsequent, to Jindal&#x27;s election, as reported by the WDSU I-Team. At least two legislators, state representatives Walker Hines and Neil Abramson, argued that this may be attributed to legislation that removed the governor&#x27;s records from the public domain; they argued that the legislation was surreptitiously inserted as a last-minute amendment into an education bill by Jindal&#x27;s office on the last day of the 2008 session, providing no time to properly review it before it passed the legislature and was signed into law by Jindal.

===Gun rights and gun control===
Jindal is a fervent supporter of the Second Amendment and generally opposes gun control. He has been endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund and received an A rating from Gun Owners of America while he was in Congress.

As a Congressman, he sponsored the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006 with Senator Vitter.

In July 2015, during an interview with CBS, Jindal stated that he supported stricter background checks, and that every state should begin to enact tougher background checks on gun buyers.

===Tax policy===
As a private citizen, Jindal voted in 2002 for the Louisiana constitutional amendment known as the Stelly Plan which lowered some sales taxes in exchange for higher income taxes. After taking office, Jindal cut taxes a total of six times, including the largest income tax cut in Louisiana&#x27;s history – a cut of $1.1 billion over five years, along with accelerating the elimination of the tax on business investments. In January 2013, Jindal said he wanted to eliminate all Louisiana corporate and personal income taxes, without giving details for his proposal.

As U.S. Representative from Louisiana, Jindal received grades of B in 2005, B− in 2006, and C in 2007 from the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative taxpayers advocacy organization. As Governor of Louisiana, Jindal received grades of A in 2010, B in 2012, and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s Governors.

===Education===
In 2008, Jindal came out in favour of the Common Core State Standards Initiative, which Louisiana adopted in 2010.

In 2014, Jindal wrote that &quot;It has become fashionable in the news media to believe there is a right-wing conspiracy against Common Core.&quot;

Jindal proposed budgets that impose cuts on higher education funding in Louisiana, leading to protests from students and education advocates. Jindal proposed several controversial education reforms, including vouchers for low income students in public schools to attend private institutions using Minimum Foundation Program funds.

The legislation also included controversial changes in teacher evaluations, tenure and pensions. Hundreds of teachers, administrators and public education supporters protested against the legislation at the capital of Louisiana, some of whom cancelled classes to attend demonstrations. Many participants circulated petitions to recall Jindal and Republican House Speaker Chuck Kleckley. In April 2012, a Louisiana Public Broadcasting program examined possible conflicts between aspects of the Jindal education reform plan and the federal desegregation orders still in place in many parts of Louisiana.

====Evolution====
Jindal signed a law that permitted teachers at public schools to supplement standard evolutionary curricula with analysis and critiques that may include intelligent design. The law provides that &quot;[c]lassroom instruction and materials shall not promote any religious doctrine&quot;, but Louisiana ACLU Director Marjorie Esman said that that provision &quot;is vague at best&quot;, and stated that the Act is &quot;susceptible to a constitutional challenge.&quot; Despite calls for a veto from John Derbyshire and some genetics professors at Brown University, Jindal signed the Louisiana Academic Freedom Act which passed the voting in the State House and the State Senate in 2008.

The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology rejected New Orleans as a site for their 2010 meeting and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology will not conduct future meetings in Louisiana.

===Civil liberties===
Jindal voted to extend the Patriot Act, voted in favor of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, supported a constitutional amendment banning flag burning, and voted for the Real ID Act of 2005.

===Immigration laws===
He criticized illegal immigration as a drain on the economy, as well as being unfair to those who entered the country by legal means. He voted to build a fence along the Mexican border and opposed granting amnesty for illegal immigrants.

===Health care===
Jindal refused to accept federal funds to expand Medicaid after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, costing his state $1.65 billion in federal health-care assistance for the poor. He supported increased health insurance portability; laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions; a cap on malpractice lawsuits; an easing of restrictions on importation of prescription medications; the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system; an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care; and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. During Jindal tenure, over 11,000 uninsured children were added to the State&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program. He also opposed a federal government-run, single-payer system, but supported state efforts to reduce the uninsured population. He has also supported expanding services for autistic children, and promoted a national childhood cancer database. Due to a congressional reduction in federal Medicaid financing rates, the Jindal administration chose to levy the largest slice of cuts on the network of LSU charity hospitals and clinics, requiring some facilities to close.

===Environmental issues and offshore drilling===
Jindal issued an executive order increasing office recycling programs, reducing solid waste and promoting paperless practices, offering tax credit for hybrid fuel vehicles, increasing average fuel economy goals by 2010, as well as increasing energy efficiency goals and standards for the state. He has stated his opposition to and voted for the criminalization of oil cartels such as OPEC. As a representative in the House, he supported a $300-million bill to fund Louisiana coastal restoration. In addition, he was the chief sponsor of successful legislation to expand the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park by over . Jindal signed bill SB 469 that would limit actions aimed at oil and gas companies operating along the coast. Jindal pledged state support for the development of economically friendly cars in northeastern Louisiana in conjunction with alternative energy advocate T. Boone Pickens. In September 2014, Jindal stated that global warming was more about increasing government regulation, and released an energy plan that was critical of the Obama Administration&#x27;s policies.

===Earmarks===
In 2007, Jindal led the Louisiana House delegation and ranked 14th among House members in requested earmark funding at nearly $97 million (however in over 99% of these requests, Jindal was a co-sponsor and not the primary initiator of the earmark legislation). $5 million of Jindal&#x27;s earmark requests were for state defense and indigent healthcare related expenditures, another $50 million was for increasing the safety of Louisiana&#x27;s waterways and levees after breaches following Hurricane Katrina, and the remainder was targeted towards coastal restoration and alternative energy research. As governor, in 2008, Jindal used his line item veto to strike $16 million in earmarks from the state budget but declined to veto $30 million in legislator-added spending. Jindal vetoed over 250 earmarks in the 2008 state budget, twice the total number of such vetoes by previous governors in the preceding 12 years.

===Opposition to Recovery Act===

Jindal has been an opponent of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Citing concerns that the augmentation of unemployment insurance may obligate the state to raise taxes on businesses, Jindal had indicated his intention to forgo federal stimulus plan funds ($98 million) aimed at increasing unemployment insurance for Louisiana. Louisiana has since been obligated to raise taxes on businesses because the unemployment trust fund had dropped below the prescribed threshold. Louisiana was set to receive about $3.8 billion overall. Jindal intended to accept at least $2.4 billion from the stimulus package. He called parts of the plan &quot;irresponsible&quot;, saying that &quot;the way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of Washington politicians.&quot;

===No-go zones===
In 2015, Jindal traveled to the UK to speak at an event by the neoconservative Henry Jackson Society. In that speech, he alleged the existence of &quot;no-go zones&quot;, allegedly established by Muslims in London and other western cities. London mayor Boris Johnson called Jindal&#x27;s remarks &quot;complete nonsense&quot;. and earlier British Prime Minister David Cameron had confirmed that there were not any no-go zones in the UK. Jindal later confirmed his meaning &quot;I knew that by speaking the truth we were going to make people upset.&quot; When later asked by CNN to provide specific examples, Jindal declined. He later added that some Muslim immigrants are trying to &quot;colonize&quot; cities in Europe and &quot;overtake the culture&quot;, and that it could happen next in the U.S.

==Personal life==
Jindal was raised in a Hindu household. He is of Indian descent and is a U.S. citizen by birthright. He converted to Christianity while in Baton Rouge Magnet High School. During his first year at Brown University, he was baptized into the Catholic Church as an adult under the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA).
Before Jindal was born, his father Amar Jindal was assistant professor of engineering at Punjab University in Chandigarh. After settling into Louisiana, Jindal&#x27;s father went on to work with a Louisiana railroad company, and his mother transitioned into Information Technology (IT). As of 2008, Jindal&#x27;s mother, Raj Jindal, was information technology director for the Louisiana Workforce Commission (formerly the Louisiana Department of Labor) and served as Assistant Secretary to former State Labor Secretary Garey Forster during the administration of Governor Mike Foster. Jindal has a younger brother, Nikesh, who is a registered Republican and supported his brother&#x27;s campaign for governor. Nikesh went to Dartmouth College, where he graduated with honors, and then Yale Law School. Nikesh is now a lawyer in Washington, D.C.

Jindal&#x27;s nickname dates to his childhood identification with Bobby Brady, a character from the 1970&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. He has been known by his nickname ever since, although his legal name remains Piyush Jindal.

In 1997, Jindal married Supriya Jolly, who was born in New Delhi, India and moved to Baton Rouge when she was 4 years old. The two attended the same high school, but Supriya&#x27;s family moved from Baton Rouge to New Orleans after her freshman year. Supriya Jindal earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering and an M.B.A. degree from Tulane University. She created The Supriya Jindal Foundation for Louisiana&#x27;s Children, a non-profit organization aimed at improving math and science education in grade schools.

They have three children: Selia Elizabeth, Shaan Robert, and Slade Ryan. Shaan was born with a congenital heart defect and had surgery as an infant. The Jindals have been outspoken advocates for children with congenital defects, particularly those without insurance. In 2006, he assisted as his wife delivered their third child at home, with him receiving medical coaching by phone to deliver their boy.

Jindal enjoys hunting in Louisiana.

Bobby Jindal endorsed Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign for 2024.

==Associated business ventures==
In September 2022, telehealth company LifeMD (NASDAQ:LFMD) named Jindal to its board of directors. LifeMD is a leading provider of virtual primary care services operating across all 50 states. The company offers a range of virtual services including primary care, diagnostics, a comprehensive weight management program, specialized treatments for men’s and women’s health, and more. Once appointed, Jindal remarked, &quot;I am excited about the opportunity for telehealth to empower consumers by reducing the cost of healthcare, increasing access, and improving patient outcomes. Technology-driven virtual care platforms, such as what LifeMD is building, will dramatically reshape how countless Americans access and benefit from healthcare.&quot; 

==Writings==

A list of Jindal&#x27;s published writings up to 2001 can be found in the hearing report for his 2001 U.S. Senate confirmation. They include newspaper columns, law review articles, and first authorships in several scientific and policy articles that have appeared in the prominent &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, &quot;Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Association&quot;, and &quot;Hospital Outlook&quot;.

Jindal&#x27;s pre-2001 writings include several articles in the &quot;New Oxford Review&quot;, one of which later made news during his 2003 gubernatorial race. In a 1994 article titled &quot;Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare&quot;, Jindal described the events leading up to an apparent exorcism of a friend and how he felt unable to help her at the time. However, Jindal questioned whether what he saw was actually an example of &quot;spiritual warfare&quot;.

In November 2010, Jindal published the book &quot;Leadership and Crisis&quot;, a semi-autobiography significantly influenced by the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill.

<text>The Bengali language movement was a political movement in East Bengal (modern-day Bangladesh) in 1952, advocating the recognition of the Bengali language as a co-lingua franca of the then-Dominion of Pakistan to allow its use in government affairs, the continuation of its use as a medium of education, its use in media, currency and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the Bengali alphabet / Bengali script.

When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed after the separation of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, when the British left, it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups, with the geographically non-contiguous East Bengal province having a mainly ethnic Bengali population. In 1948, the Government of the Dominion of Pakistan ordained as part of Islamization of East Pakistan or East Bengal that Urdu will be the sole federal language, alternately Bengali writing in the Perso-Arabic script or Roman script (Romanisation of Bengali) or Arabic as the state language of the whole of Pakistan was also proposed, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956.

The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the 6-Point Movement and subsequently the Bangladesh Liberation War and the Bengali Language Implementation Act, 1987. In Bangladesh, 21 February (&quot;Ekushey February&quot;) is observed as Language Movement Day, a national holiday. The Shaheed Minar monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims. On 17 September 1999, UNESCO declared 21 February as International Mother Language Day, in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethnolinguistic rights of people around the world.

==Background==
The present-day nations of Pakistan and Bangladesh were part of the British Indian Empire. From the mid-19th century, the Urdu language had been promoted as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Indian Muslims by political and religious leaders, such as Sir Khwaja Salimullah, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk and Maulvi Abdul Haq. Urdu is a Central Indo-Aryan language of the Indo-Iranian branch, closely related to Hindi and belonging to the Indo-European family of languages. It developed under Persian, Arabic and Turkic influence on apabhramshas (last linguistic stage of the medieval Indian Aryan language Pali–Prakrit) in South Asia during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. With its Perso-Arabic script, the language was considered a vital element of the Islamic culture for Indian Muslims; Hindi and the Devanagari script were seen as fundamentals of Hindu culture.

While, the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India, the Muslims of Bengal (a province in the eastern part of the British Indian sub-continent) primarily used the Bengali language. Bengali is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language that arose from the eastern Middle Indic languages around 1000 CE and developed considerably with a rich literature, history and cultural identity. Unlike many other Indic Languages, Bengali got patronage from the States and Empires in the Middle Ages. During the Bengal Renaissance, the modern Bengali literature developed its stronghold. Bengalis irrespective of religious identity used Bengali language. Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the partition of India, when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 Lucknow session of the Muslim League. The Muslim League was a British Indian political party that became the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state separate from British India.

==Early stages of the movement==
After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Bengal, the non-contiguous eastern part of the Dominion of Pakistan, made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan&#x27;s 69 million people. The Dominion of Pakistan&#x27;s government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. In November 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu and English as the sole state languages. Opposition and protests arose immediately. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul Kashem, the secretary of Tamaddun Majlish, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.

Leading Bengali scholars argued why Urdu should not be the only state language. The writer Abul Mansur Ahmed said if Urdu became the state language, the educated society of East Bengal would become &#x27;illiterate&#x27; and &#x27;ineligible&#x27; for government positions. The first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad (National Language Action Committee), an organisation in favour of Bengali as a state language was formed towards the end of December 1947. Professor Nurul Huq Bhuiyan of the Tamaddun Majlish convened the committee. Later, Parliament member Shamsul Huq convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language.

===Dhirendranath Datta&#x27;s proposal===

Assembly member Dhirendranath Datta proposed legislation in the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan to allow members to speak in Bengali and authorise its use for official purposes. Datta&#x27;s proposal was supported by legislators Prem Hari Burman, Bhupendra Kumar Datta and Sris Chandra Chattaopadhyaya of East Bengal, as well as the people from the region. Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan and the Muslim League denounced the proposal as an attempt to divide the Pakistani people, thus the legislation was defeated.

===Fazlur Rahman&#x27;s proposal ===
Since the partition of the country in 1947, the Union Minister representing East Pakistan Fazlur Rahman campaigned for the implementation of Bengali language written in Arabic script (Bengali language with the &quot;Hurful Qur&#x27;an&quot;). At the Nikhil Pakistan Teachers&#x27; Conference held in Karachi on 29 December 1948, Fazlur Rahman proposed to write Bengali in Arabic script for the sake of Islamization of the language. East Bengal Provincial Education Department Secretary Fazle Ahmad Karim Fazli was one of the main initiators of the effort to introduce the Arabic alphabet in Bengal. Both Karim Fazli and Fazlur Rahman established a society called &#x27;Hurful Qur&#x27;an Samity&#x27; with a Maulana named Zulfikar Ali of Chittagong and tried to form a movement to introduce Arabic letters in Bengal through him. Abdul Hakim, the former director of the East-Bengal Education Department said; &quot;Some funny legends are heard in Dhaka about a Bengali Wazir Sahib&#x27;s own knowledge of Urdu. He wanted to fulfill his ardent desire to beautify the in order to be admired by the all-powerful Urdu Mahal of the Centre. For this purpose, a sum of Rs. 35,000 per annum for the publication of books was arranged to hand over the central sanction to the aforesaid Provincial Education Secretary.” In response, Muhammad Shahidullah opposed the proposal, fearing further complications, and advocated making Bengali unchanged as the state language of East Bengal and one of the state languages of Pakistan.

===Proposal for Romanisation of Bengali===

During that time, romanisation of Bengali was also proposed along with other proposals regarding the determination of the state language of Pakistan. After 1947, many other East Pakistani academics, including Muhammad Qudrat-i-Khuda and Nazirul Islam Mohammad Sufian, supported the idea of writing Bengali in Roman script. In 1948, Mohammad Ferdous Khan opposed it in his pamphlet &quot;The language problem of today&quot;.

Abul Fazl Muhammad Akhtar-ud-Din supported the Roman alphabet in his article entitled &quot;Bangla Bornomalar Poribortton&quot; (বাংলা বর্ণমালার পরিবর্ত্তন, Changes in the Bengali Alphabet) published in Daily Azad on 18 April 1949.

The romanisation proposal continued on even after 1952. In 1957, the East Pakistan Education Commission recommended the use of the revised Roman script in adult education.

Around 1957–1958, there was a significant demand for the use of Roman letters again. At that time Muhammad Abdul Hai and Muhammad Enamul Haque opposed it.

===Agitations of 1948===
Students of the University of Dhaka and other colleges of the city organised a general strike on 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use, including coins, stamps and recruitment tests for the navy. The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Shawkat Ali, M Sirajul Islam, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies.

===Agreement with Khwaja Nazimuddin===
In the afternoon of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister Khawaja Nazimuddin&#x27;s house was stopped in front of the Dhaka High Court. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including A. K. Fazlul Huq. Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language. On 6 April 1948, in East Bengal Assembly resolution was passed making Bengali an official language of the province by Nazimuddin led Muslim League government of East Bengal.

===Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s visit to Dhaka===
On November 18, 1948, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan Liaquat Ali Khan visited East Pakistan. On November 27, he addressed a student meeting at the playground of Dhaka University. In that meeting, the demand for Bengali language in the certificate issued by the Dhaka University Central Student Union was again raised, but he refrained from making any comments. In a meeting of the National Language Working Council held under the chairmanship of Ataur Rahman Khan on November 17, Aziz Ahmad, Abul Kashem, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Kamruddin Ahmed, Abdul Mannan, Tajuddin Ahmed and others drafted a memorandum and sent it to Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. The Prime Minister did not respond to this either.

===Muhammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s visit to Dhaka===

In the height of civic unrest, Governor-General of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic reception at Racecourse Ground, he claimed that the language issue was designed by a &quot;fifth column&quot; to divide Pakistani Muslims. Jinnah further declared that &quot;Urdu, and only Urdu&quot; embodied the spirit of Muslim nations and would remain as the state language, labelling those who disagreed with his views as &quot;Enemies of Pakistan&quot;. Jinnah delivered a similar speech at Curzon Hall of the University of Dhaka on 24 March. At both meetings, Jinnah was interrupted by large segments of the audience. He later called a meeting of a state language committee of action, and overruled the contract that was signed by Khawaja Nazimuddin with the student leaders. Before Jinnah left Dhaka on 28 March, he delivered a speech on radio reasserting his &quot;Urdu-only&quot; policy.

=== Proposal for Arabic language ===

Muhammad Shahidullah believed that Bengalis could learn Urdu at the same time as learning English, he also believed that: &quot;When Arabic becomes the state language of Pakistan, the creation of the state of Pakistan will be justified.&quot; Therefore, in December 1949, he assumed the presidency of the East Pakistan Arabic Language Association, approved a draft memorandum to be submitted to the Assembly, where it was requested to government for Arabic to be made the state language of Pakistan and for the provision of &#x27;Darse Koran&#x27; or Quran teaching in various centers and mosques of the city. On January 18, 1950, some students of Rajshahi College called a meeting to demand that Arabic be made the state language. 3 State Bank Governor Zahid Hussain proposed to make Arabic the state language and this proposal was then supported by Syed Akbar Shah, member of Sindh Legislative Council and Vice-Chancellor of Sindh Arabic University. On 1 February 1951 at the session of the World Muslim Conference in Karachi, the leader of the Ismaili community Aga Khan said, if Arabic is made the state language of Pakistan, common communication will be established between the Muslims of the Arab world, North Africa and Indonesia. On February 10, 1951, the Secretary of the Pakistan Buddhist League, Rabindranath Burmi, issued a statement opposing these proposals in favour of Urdu instead of Arabic as state language. These proposals to make Arabic the state language did not gain much support in any part of Pakistan. However, according to Badruddin Umar, as this demand was related to the question of development of Islamic culture, it indirectly supported the demand of the introduction of Arabic script in Bengali language to some extent in some groups.

===Proposal by Language Committee===

Shortly thereafter, the East Bengal Language Committee, presided by Maulana Akram Khan, was formed by the East Bengal government to prepare a report on the language problem.

At 1949, Language Committee of the East-Bengal Government conducted a survey among teachers, intellectuals, high civil servants, members of the Legislative Council, according to which, out of 301 respondents, 96 favoured the introduction of the Arabic script, 18 the Roman script and 187 gave opinion in favour of the retention of the Bengali script. Besides, many people did not give any answer.

The committee produced its report by 6 December 1950; but it was not published before 1958. Here an effective measure was proposed by the government to solve the language problem, where they recommended writing Bengali through Arabic characters.

==Events of 1952==
The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Liaqat Ali Khan&#x27;s successor, Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin, staunchly defended the &quot;Urdu-only&quot; policy in a speech on 27 January 1952. On 31 January, the &quot;Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod&quot; (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by Maulana Bhashani. The central government&#x27;s proposal of writing the Bengali language in Arabic script by Pakistan&#x27;s Bengali education minister Fazlur Rahman was vehemently opposed at the meeting. The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies. In an attempt to prevent the demonstration, the government imposed Section 144 in Dhaka, thereby banning any gathering.

According to the earlier decision, students of Dhaka University and other educational institutions gathered at Dhaka University premises on February 4. The rally protested the proposal to write Bengali in Arabic script and demanded Bengali as the state language. The students took out a huge demonstration after their assembly.

On February 11, 1952, a long circular (No. 10) titled &#x27;Rashtra Bhashar Andolan&#x27; was promoted to the Secretariat of the Bengali Provincial Organizing Committee before the Communist Party of Pakistan&#x27;. In this circular, the Communist Party&#x27;s statement, line, and organizational duties regarding the language movement are clearly indicated.

In accordance with the principles and lines of the State Language Movement laid down in Party Circular No. 10 of the East Bengal Organizing Committee of the Communist Party of Pakistan dated February 11, they circulated a cyclostyled manifesto on February 20, which read, &quot;Respond to the call of the All-Union State Language Working Committee. Do strike, hartal, meeting and march across the province on 21st February to demand Bengali as one of the national languages with equal status for all languages.” This brief manifesto calls for, “English shall no longer be the official language; Want equality of all languages of Pakistan; Bengalis, Punjabis, Pathans, Sindhis, Balochs, Urdu speakers etc. have to be given the right to get education in their own mother tongue and conduct government affairs; We want to make Bengali language one of the national languages. Instead of English, Urdu, Bengali - the movement to give equal status to all languages in the state. English made English as the state language in order to continue the imperialist and feudal system of exploitation while keeping the various linguistic communities of Pak-India backward. The League government also adopted English as the state language for the same purpose; has kept and wants to make the only child the state language. Making one language the state language will leave the various linguistic communities of Pakistan backward and will hinder the overall development of Pakistan. Therefore, all the Bengali, Punjabi, Pathan, Siddhi, Belche, Urdu speaking nations of Pakistan should come together in the movement to give equal status to the different languages of Pakistan and make them the state language.&quot;

===21 February===

At nine o&#x27;clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators&#x27; way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Shafiur Rahman, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. The Government reported that 29 people died in that day. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.

On the same day, the East Bengal Organizing Committee of the East Pakistan Communist Party circulated a cyclostyled manifesto entitled &quot;To build a united East Bengal Tumdal United Movement against the barbaric killings of the tyrant Nurul Amin Sarkar&quot;, calling on all institutions and the multi-lingual public of Pakistan, regardless of party affiliation. Support is invited for the following demands:
* Leaving chair by Nazim Nurul Amin Sarkar 
* Want to make Bengali one of the national languages immediately
* We want the punishment of the killer, we want a private commission of inquiry, we want full compensation for the dead and injured.
* Seek immediate release of all political prisoners,
* Demand withdrawal of Security Act, Section 144 and all repressive laws.

===22 February===
Disorder spread across the province as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned the actions of the police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the &quot;Jubilee Press&quot; and the &quot;Morning News&quot;. Police fired on a major &quot;janaza&quot;, or mourning rally, as it was passing through Nawabpur Road. The shooting killed several people including activist Sofiur Rahman and a nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah.

===Continued unrest===

Through the night of 23 February, students of Dhaka Medical College worked on the construction of a &quot;Shaheed Smritistombho&quot;, or Monument of Martyrs. Completed at dawn on 24 February, the monument had a handwritten note attached to it with the words &quot;Shaheed Smritistombho&quot;. Inaugurated by the father of the slain activist Sofiur Rahman, the monument was destroyed on 26 February by police. On 25 February, industrial workers in the town of Narayanganj observed a general strike. A protest followed on 29 February whose participants faced severe police beating.

The government censored news reports and withheld exact casualty figures during the protests. Most pro-government media held Hindus and communists responsible for encouraging the disorder and student unrest. The families of Abul Barkat and Rafiq Uddin Ahmed tried to charge the police with murder, but the charges were dismissed by the police. On 8 April government report on the incidents failed to show any particular justification for police firings on the students.

===Reaction in West Pakistan===
Although the Language Movement is considered to have laid the foundations for ethnic nationalism in many of the Bengalis of East Bengal and later East Pakistan, it also heightened the cultural animosity between the authorities of the two wings of Pakistan. In the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan, the movement was seen as a sectional uprising against Pakistani national interests. The rejection of the &quot;Urdu-only&quot; policy was seen as a contravention of the Perso-Arabic culture of Muslims and the founding ideology of Pakistan, the two-nation theory. Some of the most powerful politicians from the western wing of Pakistan considered Urdu a product of Indian Islamic culture, but saw Bengali as a part of &quot;Hinduized&quot; Bengali culture. Most stood by the &quot;Urdu only&quot; policy because they believed that only a single language, one that was not indigenous to Pakistan, should serve as the national language. This kind of thinking also provoked considerable opposition in the western wing, wherein there existed several linguistic groups. As late as in 1967, military dictator Ayub Khan said, &quot;East Bengal is ... still under considerable Hindu culture and influence.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The &quot;Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod&quot;, with support from the Awami Muslim League, decided to commemorate 21 February as &quot;Shohid Dibosh&quot;. On the first anniversary of the protests, people across East Bengal wore black badges in solidarity with the victims. Most offices, banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion. Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order. More than 100,000 people assembled at a public meeting held in Dhaka, where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners. However, Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an &quot;enemy of the state&quot;. Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests. Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning.

===United Front in 1954===
Political tensions came to a held as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition United Front coalition, which—led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested. A meeting of parliament&#x27;s Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister Muhammad Ali Bogra, resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as Maulvi Abdul Haq condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League&#x27;s decision. Consequently, the implementation failed and the United Front won a vast majority of seats in the legislative assembly, while the representation of the Muslim League was reduced to a historic low.

The United Front ministry ordered the creation of the Bangla Academy to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage. However, the United Front rule was temporary, as Governor General Ghulam Muhammad cancelled the government and started Governor&#x27;s rule on 30 May 1954. The United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor&#x27;s regime ended. The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though.

Following the return of the United Front to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was observed for the first time in a peaceful atmosphere. The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar. The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed.

===Constitutional status as a state language===
With the defeat of the Muslim League in the East Bengal assembly elections, the central government became flexible in recognising Bengali as the state language of Pakistan along with Urdu. At least a few thousand people protested in the National Assembly on April 22 against the decision.

On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League&#x27;s support, to grant official status to Bengali. Bengali was adopted as an official language of Pakistan along with Urdu in the article 214(1) when the first constitution of Pakistan was enacted on 29 February 1956. Mohammad Ali Bogra raised the language related clauses of the constitution in Parliament. According to the clauses, Bengali language was given equal recognition as state language like Urdu. In Parliament and the Legislative Assembly, besides Urdu and English, there was an opportunity to speak in Bengali. The constitution also provided opportunities for higher education in Bengali.

However, the military government formed by Ayub Khan made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution&#x27;s policy of two state languages.

=== Standard Bengali Movement ===
The Bengali language movement and the banning of Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s works by the central government of Pakistan led to a movement by the intellectuals of Dhaka that led to an increase in the use of Central Standard Bengali in the city in the 1950s and 1960s.

===Independence of Bangladesh===
Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan at the expense of East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. Due to regional economic, social, and political imbalances, sectional divisions grew, and the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called &quot;Bangladesh&quot; (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.

==Cultural impact and celebration==
===Bangladesh===

The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society. It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language, literature and culture. 21 February, celebrated as Language Movement Day or &quot;Shohid Dibosh&quot; (Martyrs&#x27; Day), is a major national holiday in Bangladesh. A month-long event called the Ekushey Book Fair is held every year to commemorate the movement. &quot;Ekushey Padak&quot;, one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement. Songs such as Abdul Gaffar Choudhury&#x27;s &quot;Ekusher Gaan&quot;, set to music by Shaheed Altaf Mahmud, as well as plays, works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people&#x27;s emotions during the movement. Since the events of February 1952, poems, songs, novels, plays, films, cartoons, and paintings were created to capture the movement from the varied point of views. Notable artistic depictions include the poems &quot;Bornomala, Amar Dukhini Bornomala&quot; and &quot;February 1969&quot; by Shamsur Rahman, the film &quot;Jibon Theke Neya&quot; by Zahir Raihan, the stage play &quot;Kobor&quot; by Munier Chowdhury and the novels &quot;Ekushey February&quot; by Raihan and &quot;Artonaad&quot; by Shawkat Osman.

Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new &quot;Shaheed Minar&quot; (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who died. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect Hamidur Rahman began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry, and was approved by a planning committee chaired by University of Dhaka Vice-Chancellor Mahmud Husain and College of Fine Arts principal Zainul Abedin. Hamidur Rahman&#x27;s model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column symbolising a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the centre of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by Abul Barkat&#x27;s mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973. Ekushey Television, one of the oldest privately owned television channels in Bangladesh, was named after the date of the event.

===India===
Apart from Bangladesh, there was also a movement in the Indian state of Assam to give equal status to the Bengali language. On May 19, 1961, at Silchar railway station, 11 Bengalis were martyred by police firing while demanding the recognition of Bengali as a state language. Later, Bengali was granted the status of a semi-official language in three districts of Assam where the Bengali-speaking population is predominant. The states of West Bengal and Tripura in India celebrate 21 February as Language Movement Day.

===Worldwide: International Mother Language Day===
Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO to declare 21 February as International Mother Language Day. The proposal was supported unanimously at the 30th General Conference of UNESCO held on 17 November 1999.

<doc id="1133034" wikidata="Q258115" url="?curid=1133034" title="Diego Simeone">
<text>Diego Pablo Simeone González (; ; born 28 April 1970), nicknamed &quot;El Cholo&quot; (), is an Argentine professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. He has been the manager of club Atlético Madrid since December 2011.

In his club career that started in 1987, Simeone played in Argentina, Italy, and Spain for Vélez Sarsfield, Pisa, Sevilla, Atlético Madrid, Inter Milan, Lazio and Racing Club. He won a domestic double with Atlético Madrid in 1996, and the UEFA Cup with Inter in 1998, also winning another domestic double with Lazio in 2000, as well as the 1999 UEFA Super Cup and the 2000 Supercoppa Italiana. Simeone was capped over 100 times for the Argentina national team and represented the country at the 1994, 1998, and 2002 FIFA World Cups, and in four editions of the Copa América, winning the tournament in 1991 and 1993. He also won the FIFA Confederations Cup in 1992, the 1993 Artemio Franchi Cup, and a silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympic games.

As a manager, Simeone has coached Argentine sides Racing Club, Estudiantes, River Plate, San Lorenzo and Italian club Catania, before joining Spanish club Atlético Madrid in 2011. He won the Argentine Primera División both with Estudiantes and River Plate.

Simeone has had his biggest managerial success with Atlético Madrid, turning the team into a competitor for the La Liga and breaking the Real Madrid–Barcelona duopoly. He has won La Liga twice, the Copa del Rey, two UEFA Europa Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, as well as being runner-up of the UEFA Champions League twice. Simeone is the longest-serving manager in La Liga, having stayed over more than a decade at Atlético.

==Club career==

When Simeone was 14, his youth coach Victorio Spinetto nicknamed him &quot;Cholo&quot;, as his energetic play reminded him of former Boca Juniors player and Argentine international Carmelo Simeone (no relation) who possessed the nickname.

After starting his career with Vélez Sarsfield, Simeone moved to Italian Serie A club Pisa in 1990. The club was relegated in his first season and, after it failed to gain promotion the following year, Simeone was sold to Sevilla in the Spanish La Liga. Simeone played two seasons in Seville, after which he was signed by Atlético Madrid. At Atlético, he was part of the team which won the double of the Liga title and Copa del Rey during the 1995–96 season, serving as the club&#x27;s captain.

In 1997, Simeone returned to Serie A with Inter Milan, and played two full seasons, winning the 1997–98 UEFA Cup in a side spearheaded by Ronaldo up front. In 1999, Simeone joined fellow Argentines Néstor Sensini, Matías Almeyda and Juan Sebastián Verón at Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s Lazio. The side had gone close to the &quot;Scudetto&quot; in the season before Simeone&#x27;s arrival and he helped deliver the championship after a season, where Juventus led the standings by two points going into the last day. A Juve loss at rainy Perugia coupled with Lazio&#x27;s comfortable 3–0 home win over Reggina at the Stadio Olimpico ensured Simeone&#x27;s first Serie A title. After winning the double in Spain, he would then add the Italian double as Lazio edged out Inter to claim the 1999–2000 Coppa Italia.

He went on to play three more seasons in Rome, which included more last day drama as Simeone&#x27;s goal against former club Inter on the last day of the 2001–02 campaign effectively ruined his old employers&#x27; title dream.

After cancelling his contract with Lazio, Simeone returned to Atlético Madrid in 2003, spending his next two seasons there. In total, he played in 165 matches for Atlético, scoring 31 goals. In December 2004, it was confirmed that he would leave Europe and return to Argentina to finish his playing career with Racing Club.

==International career==
In 1992, Simeone represented the Argentina under-23 team at the 1992 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament in Paraguay, which saw Argentina fail to qualify for the 1992 Summer Olympics.

For the Argentina senior team, Simeone amassed 106 caps, the first coming in 1988 in a 4–1 defeat to Australia. He is the first footballer to earn 100 international caps for Argentina, with his century of appearances coming in a match against Venezuela in March 2002.

Although he was left out of the Argentina squad that finished in second place at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Simeone later won the 1991 and 1993 editions of the Copa América with Argentina. He played in the 1994, 1998, and 2002 FIFA World Cups, captaining the team at the 1998 World Cup. He was also part of the 1995 and 1999 Copa América Argentina squads, as well as the Argentina under-23 squad that won the silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, as one of the three overage players allowed per squad. As a midfielder, Simeone scored 11 goals for his country, including one in the 3–1 final victory over Saudi Arabia in the 1992 FIFA Confederations Cup. He also won the 1993 Artemio Franchi Cup over Denmark 5–4 on penalties following a 1–1 draw, netting Argentina&#x27;s third spot kick.

He featured in midfield in Argentina&#x27;s second round tie against Romania at the 1994 World Cup, contributing to Abel Balbo&#x27;s goal, who scored from the rebound after Simeone&#x27;s shot had been saved, although he could not prevent Argentina from being eliminated from the competition following a surprise 3–2 defeat. During the round of 16 of the 1998 World Cup, England&#x27;s David Beckham was sent off for kicking Simeone in retaliation for a foul (see also Argentina–England football rivalry); Argentina won the match on penalties. Simeone later said he simulated the injury from the kick in order to get Beckham sent off. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; was critical of the Argentinian&#x27;s theatrics in that incident, stating Simeone first delivered a &quot;heavy-handed challenge&quot; on Beckham and then &quot;fell like a ton of bricks&quot; when Beckham retaliated. In the following round, against the Netherlands, Simeone was injured by a tackle from Arthur Numan during his team&#x27;s late 2–1 defeat. In the 2002 World Cup, his last, Argentina was eliminated in the group stage, which included a 1–0 loss to England in which Beckham converted a penalty.

Simeone said in 2002 that he was &quot;embarrassed&quot; at having surpassed Diego Maradona as Argentina&#x27;s most capped player, though Simeone has since been surpassed by Roberto Ayala, Javier Mascherano, Javier Zanetti, Ángel Di María, Nicolás Otamendi and Lionel Messi.

==Style of play==
Simeone was regarded as a tenacious, versatile, hard-working and complete two-way midfielder who was mobile, good in the air, and capable both of winning balls and starting attacking plays, while also having a penchant for scoring several goals himself. This enabled him to play anywhere in midfield throughout his career, although he was usually deployed in the centre in a box-to-box or defensive midfield role. He was also used in an offensive midfield role on occasion, even if it was not his optimal playing position, due to his ability to get forward, in addition to assisting his team defensively. During the 1998 World Cup, he was also deployed as a left-sided wing-back in the round-of-16 match against England. A talented yet combative player, he was primarily known for his leadership, tactical versatility, intelligence, strength and stamina, although he was also praised by pundits for his technique, vision and passing range. Simeone once described his hard-tackling playing style as &quot;holding a knife between his teeth,&quot; and likening himself to a &quot;warrior, a fighter who aims to give everything.&quot; His main inspirations as a player were Brazilian midfielder Falcão and German midfielder Lothar Matthäus.

==Managerial career==
===Early years===
Simeone ended his playing career for Racing Club, playing his last match on 17 February 2006, and then became manager for the same team. After a rough start, the team made an impressive finish in the 2006 Clausura. When a new club president was elected, Simeone left Racing in May 2006 and was replaced by Reinaldo Merlo.

On 18 May, Simeone became head coach of Estudiantes and soon led them to their first league title in 23 years after defeating Boca Juniors 2–1 in a final match played on 13 December 2006. In an October 2006 poll in the sports daily &quot;Olé&quot;, Simeone was voted as the best manager in the Argentine league. He was also praised as a &quot;born manager&quot; by former Argentine international Roberto Perfumo. Simeone left Estudiantes after the end of the 2007 Apertura, where Estudiantes was not a contender after a poor start, but had a strong finish of nine games without defeat. On 15 December 2007, Simeone was unveiled as the new River Plate coach, succeeding Daniel Passarella. The contract was reported to be for one year, starting on 3 January 2008. After an early elimination in the Copa Libertadores, losing to San Lorenzo in the second round, Simeone and River Plate went on to win the 2008 Clausura championship after beating Olimpo 2–1 in the Monumental. On 7 November 2008, Simeone announced his resignation as coach of River Plate after their elimination in the quarter-finals of the 2008 Copa Sudamericana by Mexican side Chivas and a poor run of form of 11 domestic matches without a win, which left them bottom of the Primera División Argentina with only six matches remaining. On 15 April 2009, Simeone joined San Lorenzo to replace Miguel Ángel Russo following the club&#x27;s exit in the first round of the 2009 Copa Libertadores. On 3 April 2010, Simeone resigned from San Lorenzo due to poor results and mounting criticism.

===Catania and Racing Club===
On 19 January 2011, Simeone flew to Sicily to join Serie A side Catania, replacing Marco Giampaolo, who left the club just hours earlier. On 1 June 2011, Simeone left his post after helping Catania stave off relegation. On 21 June 2011, Simeone was named as the new coach of Racing Club for a second spell in charge, replacing Miguel Ángel Russo, who had resigned the week prior.

===Atlético Madrid===
====2011–13: Europa League and Copa del Rey triumphs====
On 23 December 2011, Simeone was unveiled as the new Atlético Madrid coach, succeeding Gregorio Manzano, who had been dismissed the day before following defeat to third-tier Albacete in the Copa del Rey. His first game as Atlético manager was a 0–0 away draw against Manuel Pellegrini&#x27;s Malaga. His first season ended with the team winning the UEFA Europa League by beating Athletic Bilbao 3–0 in the final in Bucharest.

On 31 August 2012, his Atlético side won the UEFA Super Cup after defeating Chelsea 4–1 at the Stade Louis II in Monaco. In the domestic league, the team made an impressive start to the season, finishing the first half in second place, behind only Barcelona and above city rivals Real Madrid. Eventually, Simeone led the team to a third-place finish in the league, which at the time was the best finish in 17 years for Atlético. On 17 May 2013, he won the Copa del Rey after Atlético defeated rivals Real Madrid 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu.

====2013–17: La Liga win and Champions League finals====

Atlético began the 2013–14 season with a similar squad to their prior season, despite selling star player Radamel Falcao to Monaco for a reported €60 million fee. They also acquired David Villa from Barcelona on a free transfer. While the season began with a defeat to &quot;Barça&quot; in the 2013 Supercopa de España, the team recorded eight-straight victories in La Liga, the best league start in club history. This included a 1–0 away win at the Santiago Bernabéu against Real Madrid, making Simeone the first Atlético manager since Claudio Ranieri in 1999 to record a league victory there. Atlético finished the first half of the season in first place in La Liga, level on points with Barcelona at 47. In the last round of the season, on 17 May, Atlético needed at least a draw in the Camp Nou against Barcelona to be crowned champions for the first time since 1996, while a loss would give the title to Barcelona. A Diego Godín header from a corner kick in the 48th minute gave Atlético an equaliser and the draw they needed to win their tenth league title and first since 1996, when Simeone himself was an Atlético player.

Simeone became the second Argentine manager after Helenio Herrera to hand Atlético a Spanish championship, and the second manager after Luis Aragonés to win it both as a player and as a coach of the team. Under Simeone, Atlético collected 90 points in La Liga, surpassing its 1996 record of 87, making the 2013–14 season the most successful in club history.

Also in 2013–14, Atlético finished top of their Champions League group and qualified for the quarter-finals with a 5–1 aggregate win over Milan in the round of 16. This was the first time they had reached the Champions League quarter-finals since 1996–97, when Simeone played for the team. In the quarter-finals, Atlético defeated Barcelona 2–1 on aggregate from Simeone&#x27;s tactic of cutting the swift-passing midfield of Barcelona in two, thus denying them space and isolating Xavi and Andrés Iniesta from forwards Lionel Messi and Neymar. In the semi-finals, Atlético defeated José Mourinho&#x27;s Chelsea 3–1 at Stamford Bridge following a goalless draw at home to reach the Champions League final for only the second time in club history, the first being in 1974. Atlético was the only undefeated team in the Champions League prior to the final, recording nine wins and three draws, and had the best defence in the competition, conceding only 6 goals in 12 matches.

In the final on 24 May 2014, Atlético faced city rivals Real Madrid at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon. Despite leading from Diego Godín&#x27;s header, Atlético conceded a late equaliser in the 93rd minute of the match. The goal hampered Atlético&#x27;s morale, and the team ended up losing 4–1 after extra time, with Simeone losing the opportunity to be the third Argentine coach to win the Champions League, after Luis Carniglia and Helenio Herrera. After the final goal, Real Madrid&#x27;s Raphaël Varane kicked the ball towards Simeone, causing Simeone to run onto the pitch in anger. He was sent to the stands, and Varane was booked for the incident. Reflecting, Simeone said, &quot;I also made a mistake with my reaction. He&#x27;s a young guy with a bright future.&quot; Simeone also admitted a mistake in selecting striker Diego Costa to start the match, as he had been recently injured and was forced off after eight minutes.

In the summer of 2014, Chelsea acquired Diego Costa, Filipe Luís and Thibaut Courtois from Atlético, and also David Villa moved to the MLS. In response, Atlético acquired striker Mario Mandžukić from Bayern Munich, goalkeeper Jan Oblak from Benfica and forwards Antoine Griezmann from Real Sociedad and Ángel Correa from San Lorenzo, and recovered young midfielder Saúl who was on loan at Rayo Vallecano. The season started with Atlético defeating city rivals Real Madrid for the Spanish Super Cup in August and repeating the previous year&#x27;s victory in the Bernabéu for the league in September. In January, the team acquired Fernando Torres on loan from Milan. However, Atlético finished the league in third place and was eliminated in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals by Real Madrid 1–0, on aggregate.

Before the start of the 2015–16 season, Filipe Luís returned from Chelsea with the team also acquiring Montenegrin defender Stefan Savić and Belgian midfielder Yannick Carrasco. Mario Mandžukić left for Juventus. In 2015–16, Atlético was the team with the best defensive record in Europe&#x27;s &quot;big five&quot; leagues, only allowing 18 goals scored against them in 38 La Liga games. Atlético was also the team with the most clean sheets in their games. The team was contending the league title until the last fixture against Barcelona and Real Madrid, settling for third with 88 points.

In the UEFA Champions League, Simeone led Atlético to their second Champions League final in three seasons, becoming the first Argentine manager since Héctor Cúper to reach two Champions League finals. Atlético had defeated PSV on penalties during the round of 16, beat defending champions Barcelona 3–2 on aggregate and favourites Bayern Munich 2–2, going through on away goals, setting up a repeat of the 2014 final again facing Real Madrid. The match ended 1–1 after extra time leading to a penalty shootout. Juanfran was the only player to miss his kick, enabling Cristiano Ronaldo to score Real&#x27;s last spot kick, condemning Atlético to a second Champions League final defeat in three seasons.
In the summer of 2016, Atlético purchased forward Kevin Gameiro from Sevilla, midfielder Nicolás Gaitán from Benfica, and defender Šime Vrsaljko from Sassuolo. They also acquired the rights to Fernando Torres (previously on loan from Milan). The team again finished third in the league and lost in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals, again to Real Madrid.

====2017–21: Second Europa League and La Liga victories====
On 5 September 2017, Simeone extended his contract with Atlético for two more years, until June 2020. In the 2017–18 season, Atlético would finish in second place in La Liga, behind Barcelona but ahead of city rivals Real Madrid.

In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage, Atlético did not advance and dropped to the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League. In January 2018, Diego Costa returned to Atlético from Chelsea. On 16 May 2018, the team won the 2018 UEFA Europa League Final against Marseille. Simeone was sent to the stands in the first leg of the semi-finals against Arsenal and was suspended. He was forced to watch the second leg and final from the stands.

In the 2018–19 season, Atlético bought Thomas Lemar from Monaco and Rodri from Villarreal, and in January 2019 acquired Álvaro Morata on loan from Chelsea, while longtime team captain Gabi signed for Qatari club Al-Sadd before the start of the season. The team again finished second in the league behind Barcelona and ahead of city rivals Real Madrid. In the Champions League, they advanced to the first knockout round, where they were eliminated by Juventus, winning the first leg 2–0 at the Wanda Metropolitano but losing the return leg 3–0 in Turin.

Simeone guided his side into the last 16 of UEFA Champions League for the sixth time since he came to reign in 2011, while before his arrival Atlético had only done so seven times in 60 years. On 11 March 2020, Atlético Madrid eliminated the reigning European champions Liverpool with a 3–2 triumph after extra-time at Anfield, winning 4–2 on aggregate, after Saúl secured a 1–0 first-leg win in the reverse via a 5th-minute strike.
On 27 June 2020, Simeone won his 195th game in the top-flight of Spanish football as Atleti beat Alavés 2–1 on Saturday. With the triumph, the Argentine has overtaken the club legend, Luis Aragonés (194), as the manager with the most La Liga wins in the club&#x27;s history.
On 7 July 2020, Simeone overtook John Toshack as the third coach with the most games managed at a single club in the history of the top-flight of Spanish football during Atleti&#x27;s match against Celta Vigo, his 323rd game in La Liga. Only Miguel Muñoz (Real Madrid, 424) and, the club legend, Luis Aragonés (407) remain ahead of him.

For the 2020–21 season, Atlético parted ways with longtime-serving forward Diego Costa and acquired Luis Suárez after his departure from Barcelona. The team brought back Yannick Carrasco from Dalian Professional and also acquired Geoffrey Kondogbia from Valencia, Lucas Torreira on loan from Arsenal and Moussa Dembelé on loan from Lyon, while Thomas Partey left for Arsenal and Álvaro Morata was loaned to Juventus. On 17 October 2020, Simeone reached his 200th win in the league in a 2–0 away win against Celta Vigo. On 30 December 2020, he reached his 500th match in charge of Atlético Madrid in a 1–0 win over Getafe.
On 10 March 2021, Simeone overtook Luis Aragonés for the most wins ever as manager of the club in a 2–1 home win against Athletic Bilbao, his 309th win overall.

After a 4–0 away defeat to Bayern Munich and many injuries to key players in November 2020, Simeone modified the formation of his squad by introducing a three-man defence for the first time in his tenure coaching Atlético. In this formation, Carrasco played as a wing-back, with left centre-back Mario Hermoso being instructed to also cover the left-back position when Carrasco moved forward, which made the formation tactically flexible between a three-man and four-man defence. After the formational change, Atlético were solidified defensively and began a streak of victories, including a 1–0 home victory against Barcelona. This streak propelled the team to a ten-point lead over Real Madrid and Barcelona in the 2020–21 La Liga title race by February. However, a series of bad results from February to April meant that Atlético were eliminated from the Champions League by Chelsea and Real Madrid closed the league gap to two points before the final matchday, meaning Atlético needed a victory in the last La Liga round to win the championship. Thanks to a Suárez goal in the 67th minute, Atlético Madrid managed eventually to win their second La Liga title under Simeone, after a 2–1 away win over Real Valladolid on the final match day.

On 8 July 2021, Atleti announced their extension to Simeone&#x27;s contract until 2024, and in the same announcement it was also made known that the members of his coaching staff had also renewed their contracts.

====2022–present: Contract extension and new records====
On 9 November 2023, Simeone extended his contract with Atlético Madrid until 30 June 2027. Later that month, on 28 November, he managed his 100th Champions League match in a 3–1 away victory over Feyenoord, becoming the third manager to achieve this feat with one club following Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger. On 23 November 2024, he managed his 700th match with the club in all competitions in a 2–1 victory over Alavés.

==Style of management==

Simeone&#x27;s preferred formation is the 4–4–2, which he first practised when he was manager of Estudiantes in 2006. In this formation, the two wingers move inside and act like attacking midfielders, creating space for the full backs and fluidity in the attack, effectively being a 4–2–2–2 when the team is on the offensive. The two holding midfielders provide the defensive muscle needed to win midfield battles. Utilizing this formation, Simeone&#x27;s Estudiantes won the 2006 Apertura by beating Boca Juniors 2–1 while being down to ten men from the first half. It is essentially this formation that Simeone also utilizes at Atlético Madrid. Simeone has listed his coaching influences being Marcelo Bielsa, Sven-Göran Eriksson, Alfio Basile, Victorio Spinetto, Luigi Simoni, Carlos Bilardo and Radomir Antić.

When he was manager at River Plate, a team graced with the attacking talents of Radamel Falcao, Alexis Sánchez, Ariel Ortega, Mauro Rosales, Diego Buonanotte, Augusto Fernández and Sebastián Abreu, Simeone played an aggressive 3–3–1–3 formation reminiscent of those used by influential manager (and Simeone&#x27;s mentor) Marcelo Bielsa. Using this formation, River won the 2008 Clausura, but in the next season, with Sánchez having returned to Udinese and several players suffering from injuries, the 3–3–1–3 backfired and River finished bottom of the table, with Simeone being sacked in the process.

A common feature of Simeone&#x27;s teams is defensive compactness and quick counter-attacks. Their defending consists of two stages: deep defending in their own defensive third in a narrow 4–4–2 consisting of two closely connected defensive lines of four players, and counter-pressing in their opponents&#x27; third to win the ball high up the pitch. When the ball is won, the team attack as a unit, deploying their fluid 4–2–2–2 formation, with the forwards often shifting to the flanks to create even more space. In defense, the key idea is to force opponents into wide areas, gain numerical dominance in the ball&#x27;s zone and steal the ball or force the opponent into a backward pass. Counter-pressing consists of reducing an opposing team&#x27;s space, disrupting their build-up and reducing the number of &quot;safe&quot; positions for opponents&#x27; movement on the pitch, thus eliminating goal threats. Claudio Ranieri&#x27;s Premier League-winning 2015–16 Leicester City team has been compared to Simeone&#x27;s Atletico Madrid for upsetting bigger teams by also playing a narrow 4–4–2 and being compact in defense and midfield.

In the short time he managed Italian side Catania in 2011, he switched between a 4–2–3–1 and a 4–3–1–2 in order to bring out the best from playmaker Adrián Ricchiuti while employing many of the counter-attacking features that would later become his trademark at Atlético. Ricchiuti was tasked with linking the midfield and attack and creating chances for whichever of Maxi López, Gonzalo Bergessio and Francesco Lodi were selected up front. Simeone said he did not want to &quot;fossilise [himself] with a rigid tactic,&quot; saying managers cannot have a favourite formation &quot;for the simple fact that we have to adapt not to what we like but to what we have to work with&quot;. His players stayed compact and narrow when defending, with the wide men – two of Ezequiel Schelotto, Giuseppe Mascara, Raphael Martinho and Alejandro Gómez – expected to drop back and tuck in when out of possession; meanwhile, playmaker Ricchiuti and the central striker – more often than not López – moved back into midfield rather than pressing the centre-backs, with the aim being preventing simple passes into the middle of the pitch.

Simeone is also renowned for his attention to detail and quick adaptability to a game&#x27;s changing situations. During his time as manager of Atlético Madrid, he has placed emphasis on creating chances from set-pieces, while not allowing the opponent to create chances from set-pieces. Several important goals, including the one that gave Atlético the 2014 La Liga title, have been scored from set-pieces. While his teams aren&#x27;t known for controlling possession, they are lauded for controlling the pace and space in which a game is played. He is quick in making tactical changes to influence a game&#x27;s outcome. In the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League semi-final against Bayern in Munich, with his team down 1–0 after 45 minutes, he moved Saúl Ñíguez from the right wing to a holding midfielder position, changing the 4–4–2 to a 4–1–4–1 formation with Yannick Carrasco and Antoine Griezmann on the flanks. While on paper Saúl was seemingly out of his normal position in this role, in effect this change meant that midfielders Gabi and Koke, who were overwhelmed in the first half by Bayern&#x27;s pressure, would now be shielded by Saúl&#x27;s presence behind them, and the midfield would regain its much-needed composure. Eventually, the change had the desired outcome, with Atlético equalizing through Griezmann and advancing to the Champions League final.

Simeone has also earned praise for instilling confidence and discipline in his players, which has helped his teams emerge victorious under adverse conditions. For example, in the last game of 2014&#x27;s La Liga, at the Camp Nou against Barcelona, when Atlético needed a draw to win the championship, both Diego Costa and Arda Turan were taken out of the game due to injury in the first half, and Barcelona opened the scoring. However, Simeone was able to rally his team at half-time and Godin&#x27;s header in the second half gave them the much needed draw. Simeone said: &quot;At half-time I told them to be relaxed. In the first half we did well. I knew if we scored, it would cost them. That&#x27;s what happened. There was an amazing collective effort from everyone.&quot; During a leg in the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League semi-final against Arsenal at the Emirates, Atlético were playing without key players Diego Costa, Juanfran, Filipe Luís and Vitolo, and in the 10th minute, Šime Vrsaljko was sent off with a red card, followed by Simeone being also sent off. Despite playing with ten men, without their manager at the bench, with most players in makeshift positions, and enjoying only 24% of ball possession, the team lost neither its shape nor its composure, eventually holding out to a 1–1 draw that was enough for them to progress to the final. &quot;Simeone taught us to enjoy suffering,&quot; Arda Turan said in 2015, supporting this feeling that the Argentinean coach is a man who takes the best things out of bad situations. Diego Godin has also said about his manager: &quot;The players would die for him [Simeone]. He gives belief that we can compete against much bigger teams. We have great confidence in him, we are with him to the death and also he with us - and that shows on the pitch. I believe the whole team has confidence in the coach and we all know the path we have to take: he marks the way for us and we go with him until the death. That is how you achieve things.&quot;

In the 2020–21 season, amid COVID-19 and injury crisis among the team&#x27;s forwards, Simeone experimented with back three formations, such as 5–3–2 and 3–5–2. This saw them adapt to a new, more possession-heavy style, averaging the majority of possession over the season for the first time since their victorious 2013–14 season.

==Personal life==
Simeone&#x27;s sons Giovanni, Gianluca, and Giuliano (from his first wife) are professional footballers, playing for Napoli, Rayo Majadahonda and Atlético, respectively.

Simeone also has two daughters, Francesca and Valentina, with model Carla Pereyra. Simeone and Pereyra got married in secret in June 2019.

<text>Rotterdam Termination Source is a Dutch gabber/hardcore group fronted by Maurice Steenbergen, initially with Danny Scholte as well. The group is most famous for its minimalist 1992 single &quot;Poing&quot;, which topped the charts in the Netherlands and Denmark, and reached #27 in the UK Singles Chart.

The group reached #73 in the UK chart in 1993 with the single, &quot;Merry X-Mess&quot;. As of 2005, Steenbergen has merged the group with Guido Pernet of Human Resource, famous for their hit single &quot;Dominator&quot;.

==Poing==
Poing is a gabber track by the Rotterdam Termination Source released by Rotterdam Records in 1992. The song, composed by Maurice Steenbergen and Danny Scholte, took a minimalist approach: during the whole length of the track, a distinctive pounding beat with a &quot;poing&quot; sound can be heard. The track topped the charts in the Netherlands and Denmark. It reached number 27 in the UK chart in November 1992.

The English football team West Bromwich Albion F.C.&#x27;s &quot;Boing Boing&quot; crowd chant is reportedly based on this track.

<doc id="1133040" wikidata="Q3515436" url="?curid=1133040" title="Tampion">
<text>A tampion or tompion (in the Royal Navy) is a wooden plug, or a metal, canvas, rubber, or plastic cover, for the muzzle of a gun, howitzer, or mortar. Tampions can be found on both land-based artillery and naval guns. Naval tampions have been developed into works of art.

== History ==
Although the cannon of ships of the line were protected as they were retracted inside the ships, many smaller vessels had exposed gundecks which required a plug to protect inside of the barrels. To combat rust when ships were not in action the barrels were sealed, both with a tampion and plugs in the touch hole. A quantity of olive oil and a round shot were left inside in the barrel; With the gun laid horizontally the shot would roll up and down the barrel as the ship caught each wave, effectively lubricating the gun simply through the motion of the ship.

Later, the invention of revolving gun turrets meant that all guns were constantly exposed to water. Hence, when not in use, naval guns were protected by wooden, and, later, rubber, muzzle plugs. They were also used to protect the barrel whenever the guns were placed in storage, for example in the hold where moisture could cause corrosion, and sealed in with putty.

Typically, rubber and plastic tampions can be shot through in case of an emergency. Plastic tampions are normally designed to be expelled by the build-up of pressure in the barrel as the first shell is fired.

Over time, tampions were embossed or engraved with the arms of the unit, and they became collector&#x27;s items. Nowadays, even warships that typically would not carry heavy guns, such as submarines, have their own badges in the shape of a tampion.

<text>William Michael &quot;Bil&quot; Dwyer (born March 30, 1962) is an American stand-up comedian, game-show host, actor, and writer. He is perhaps most well known as the host or play-by-play announcer on series such as &quot;BattleBots,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, and &quot;Extreme Dodgeball&quot;, as well as several iterations of VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot;, &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s&quot;, and &quot;I Love the &#x27;90s&quot;, and a 2006 appearance on &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;. His debut comedy album, &quot;Am I Yelling?&quot;, was released in September 2020 by comedy label Stand Up! Records.

==Personal life==
Dwyer was born in Evergreen Park, Illinois, the youngest of five children in an Irish Catholic family. He graduated from Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1984 with a degree in radio and television. Before landing on comedy as a career Dwyer worked as a DJ, a salesman, and a tour guide at Universal Studios. Dwyer has been married since 1993 and has four children. He lives in Glendale, California.

Dwyer spells his first name with only one L, once explaining to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;the second is superfluous.&quot;

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
Dwyer began performing stand-up while in college in Chicago, and later moved to Los Angeles. His comedy tends to focus on domestic topics such as marriage, family, and children. &quot;Tahoe Daily Tribune&quot; writer Howie Nave described his style as &quot;somewhat sarcastic&quot;, but added, &quot;you can see his Midwestern sweetness emerge.&quot;

In 2001, he recorded a half-hour special for &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot;. In 2006, he was a contestant on the fourth season of &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;, but was eliminated in the second regular episode, finishing 10th in the competition. He has also performed on &quot;Comedy Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;.

===Game shows===
Dwyer hosted five seasons of the Comedy Central show &quot;BattleBots&quot; from 2000 to 2002. He was the play-by-play announcer for the Game Show Network&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Dodgeball&quot; in 2004, and in 2006, he hosted a remake of the panel show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; whose twist was that all the featured panelists were gay. The series ran for 40 episodes and was canceled after one season, but the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Dwyer&#x27;s performance as host, calling him &quot;affable and fast with a quip.&quot; Other shows Dwyer has hosted include &quot;Dirty Rotten Cheater&quot; for PAX/Ion Television in 2003, the FSN sports-trivia show &quot;Ultimate Fan League&quot;, as well as a YouTube series about golf, &quot;The Range with Bil Dwyer&quot;. He hosted the 2005 series &quot;MTV&#x27;s The 70s House&quot; in character as the intentionally cheesy &quot;Bert Van Styles&quot;.

===Acting===
Dwyer appeared on the 2007 Cartoon Network live-action/animation hybrid series &quot;Out of Jimmy&#x27;s Head&quot; in a dual role as the main character&#x27;s father and his school guidance counselor. He had a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; as Valerie Bertinelli&#x27;s ex-husband. Dwyer played the lead role of Leon, a washed-up champion ping-pong player, in the 2010 dark-comedy web series &quot;Kill Spin&quot;. The series ran for 10 episodes on the social-media website Lockerz. He has also been a guest star on a number of other sitcoms and TV shows, including &quot;Space Force&quot;, &quot;The Middle&quot;, &quot;Lopez&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, &quot;House of Lies&quot;, &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot;, &quot;Suburgatory&quot;, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, and &quot;iCarly&quot;. Dwyer&#x27;s film credits include &quot;Ski School 2,&quot; &quot;The Bogus Witch Project&quot; and &quot;What Planet Are You From?&quot; Dwyer also starred in a series of Toyota commercials about the &quot;Tiny Football League&quot; which ran during NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;.

<doc id="1133050" wikidata="Q7873781" url="?curid=1133050" title="USS Samuel B. Roberts (DD-823)">
<text>USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; (DD-823), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Samuel B. Roberts, a Navy coxswain who was killed evacuating Marines during the battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. The crew nicknamed the ship the &quot;Steamin&#x27; Sammy B.&quot; for its busy schedule.

The second &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was laid down on 27 June 1945 by the Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas; launched on 30 November 1945; sponsored by the namesake coxswain&#x27;s mother; and commissioned on 22 December 1946.

==1947–1953==
Following shakedown training off Guantanamo Bay in February 1947, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet. The ship participated in Atlantic Fleet maneuvers before proceeding to the Mediterranean in January 1948. Returning to the United States in June, the destroyer began another year of operations along the East Coast of the United States. A second tour of foreign duty took the ship to northern Europe from May to September 1949.

&quot;Roberts&quot; participated in western Atlantic operations until March 1950, when the ship sailed to the Mediterranean to join the 6th Fleet until October. Following operations in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, the &quot;Roberts&quot; got underway for Scotland on 10 September 1952 to join NATO forces in &quot;Operation Mainbrace&quot;, before proceeding to the Mediterranean to join the 6th Fleet. Two months later, in November, the ship returned for duty off northern Europe, and finally sailed for the United States, arriving at Newport on 29 January 1953.

==1953–1957==
&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean from early 1953 until 3 August 1954, when the ship headed for the western Pacific, via the Panama Canal, to begin an around-the-world cruise. The destroyer spent five months in the waters around Japan and the Philippines, then sailed across the Indian Ocean and through the Suez Canal, arriving home on 14 March 1955. The remainder of 1955 was spent in local operations with the exception of a hastily ordered voyage in July to a lifeguard station off Greenland during President Eisenhower&#x27;s flight to Geneva.

Western Atlantic operations in early 1956 gave way to foreign duty when &quot;Roberts&quot; again joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on 27 September. On 25 October, &quot;Roberts&quot; weighed anchor for the Persian Gulf and duty with the Middle East Force. The destroyer transited the Suez Canal on the night of 27/28 October, the last warship to transit the canal southbound before it was closed during the invasion of Egypt. The ship was then on duty with the Middle East Force until sailing for home by way of Pakistan, India, East Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, and Brazil. &quot;Roberts&quot; arrived in Newport on 14 March 1957.

With the exception of a Midshipman Cruise to Rio de Janeiro, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; remained near Newport until mid-September. The ship then participated in NATO exercises off northern Europe and returned to the United States on 22 October 1957.

==1958==
In March 1958, after a three-month overhaul, the destroyer moved into the Caribbean for refresher training. In May, the exercises were interrupted. &quot;Roberts&quot; deployed hastily to Venezuela and prepared to evacuate United States nationals following the violence during Vice President Nixon&#x27;s visit to South America. By the 15th, however, the situation was under control. &quot;Roberts&quot; was relieved and returned to Newport.

Two months later, the ship was ordered to Morehead City, North Carolina, to rendezvous with amphibious units carrying Marine reinforcements to the Mediterranean during the Lebanon crisis. By 25 July, the reinforcements were no longer needed. &quot;Roberts,&quot; as part of Destroyer Squadron 10, escorted the amphibious units to Puerto Rico, whence the destroyers continued on to the Mediterranean.

Arriving on 10 August, &quot;Roberts&quot; cruised off the coast of Lebanon from 17 August to 25 August and again from 2 to 20 September to furnish gunfire support to the troops on the beach if it proved necessary. On 17 September, the ship transited the Suez Canal on the way to the Persian Gulf for a few weeks. On the trip home, &quot;Roberts&quot; returned through the canal on 19 October, passed Gibraltar on 4 November, and arrived at the United States on 13 November.

==1959–1960==
&quot;Roberts&quot; operated continuously in the western Atlantic until 15 June 1959, when the destroyer sailed from Newport for the St. Lawrence River to participate in Operation &quot;Inland Seas&quot;, the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. After official ceremonies attended by Queen Elizabeth and President Eisenhower, &quot;Roberts&quot; transited the Seaway and crossed Lake Ontario and Lake Erie to arrive at Detroit, Michigan, on 3 July. On 20 July, &quot;Roberts&quot; moved into Lake Michigan with the first destroyer division to traverse all five Great Lakes. On 27 July, &quot;Roberts&quot; headed for the Atlantic again and arrived at Newport on 12 September.

After further U.S. East Coast activities, &quot;Roberts&quot; joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on 31 March 1960. On 29 May, the ship headed through the Suez Canal to join the Middle East Force; on 30 June, the destroyer rejoined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. On 15 October, &quot;Roberts&quot; returned to Newport.

==1962–1966==
&quot;Roberts&quot; spent most of 1961 undergoing a FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) overhaul in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The refurbished destroyer returned to Newport on 26 February 1962 and remained in the western Atlantic for the rest of 1962 and most of 1963. During April and June of the latter year, the ship operated off the northern New England coast in search of the missing submarine, .

In October 1963, &quot;Roberts&quot; resumed overseas operations; and, for the next two years, rotated between duty in the western Atlantic and tours with the 6th Fleet. In the fall of 1965, however, the ship headed south; transited the Panama Canal; and moved to the western Pacific to join the 7th Fleet. The destroyer operated primarily in Vietnamese and Philippine waters until 19 February 1966, then steamed for home via the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean. Returning to Newport, R.I., on 8 April, &quot;Roberts&quot; cruised in the Atlantic and Caribbean until deploying to the Mediterranean again on 8 December.

==1967–1971==

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; returned to Newport on 20 March, and remained in Atlantic and Caribbean waters until 10 January 1968, when the ship sailed on another tour of Mediterranean duty, returning to Newport on 17 May. The remainder of the year was spent in Atlantic operations, then Atlantic and Caribbean duty until deploying to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean on 22 November 1969. The ship steamed in the Black Sea from 9 to 12 December and returned to Newport on 22 May 1970.

In August 1970, the Inspection and Survey team ruled the ship unfit for further service. The crew stripped her for decommissioning, and the ship was struck from the Navy List on 2 November. &quot;Roberts&quot; joined the Inactive Fleet at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until she was sunk as a target in the Atlantic Ocean north of Puerto Rico on 14 November 1971. The ship&#x27;s final resting place is , below the surface.

<text>Hiester Clymer (November 3, 1827 – June 12, 1884) was an American politician and white supremacist from the state of Pennsylvania. Clymer was a member of the Hiester family political dynasty and the Democratic Party. He was the nephew of William Muhlenberg Hiester and the cousin of Isaac Ellmaker Hiester. Although Clymer was born in Pennsylvania, he was adamantly opposed to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s administration and the Republican Party&#x27;s prosecution of the American Civil War. Elected Pennsylvania state senator in 1860, Clymer opposed state legislation that supported the state Republican Party&#x27;s war effort. After the American Civil War ended, Clymer unsuccessfully ran for the Pennsylvania Governor&#x27;s office in 1866 on a white supremacist platform against Union Major-General John W. Geary. After his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872 as a Democrat, Clymer would be primarily known for his investigation of Sec. William W. Belknap&#x27;s War Department in 1876. Belknap escaped conviction in a Senate impeachment trial, and had resigned his cabinet position before being impeached by the House of Representatives. Having retired from the House in 1881, Clymer served as Vice President of the Union Trust Co. of Philadelphia and president of the Clymer Iron Co. until his death in 1884.

==Early life==
Clymer was born near Morgantown, Pennsylvania. He attended Princeton University, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1849. Clymer practiced law in Berks County and Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. His brother, Edward M. Clymer, married the actress and poet, Ella Maria Dietz.

==Political career==

He was a delegate to the national conventions of the Democratic Party in 1860 and 1868. He served in the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 8th district from 1861 to 1866. He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1866 on a white supremacist policy, losing to John W. Geary. In the controversial campaign, Clymer&#x27;s camp produced some of the most virulently graphic racist posters and pamphlets of the decade.

===U.S. Representative (1873–1881)===
He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1872 and served from March 4, 1873 to March 3, 1881. While in Congress, he served on the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State, and as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War.

==Retirement and death==
After he left Congress, he served as vice president of the Union Trust Company in Philadelphia and as president of the Clymer Iron Company. He died in Reading, Pennsylvania, on June 12, 1884, by suicide as a result of what one newspaper account called &quot;financial embarrassment.&quot; He is interred at the Charles Evans Cemetery.

<text>The Battle of Lewis&#x27;s Farm (also known as Quaker Road, Military Road, or Gravelly Run) was fought on March 29, 1865, in Dinwiddie County, Virginia near the end of the American Civil War. In climactic battles at the end of the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign, usually referred to as the Siege of Petersburg, starting with Lewis&#x27;s Farm, the Union Army commanded by Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant dislodged the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia commanded by General Robert E. Lee from defensive lines at Petersburg, Virginia and the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Many historians and the United States National Park Service consider the Battle of Lewis&#x27;s Farm to be the opening battle of the Appomattox Campaign, which resulted in the surrender of Lee&#x27;s army on April 9, 1865.

In the early morning of March 29, 1865, two corps of the Union Army of the Potomac, the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur K. Warren and the II Corps under Major General Andrew A. Humphreys, moved to the south and west of the Union line south of Petersburg toward the end of the Confederate line. The Confederate defenses were manned by the Fourth Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia under the command of Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson. The corps only included the division of Major General Bushrod Johnson.

Turning north and marching up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate line, Warren&#x27;s lead brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain, engaged three brigades of Johnson&#x27;s division at the Lewis Farm. Reinforced by a four-gun artillery battery and later relieved by two large regiments from the brigade commanded by Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory, the Union troops ultimately forced the Confederates back to their defenses and captured an important road junction. Chamberlain was wounded and narrowly escaped capture. Union Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson was awarded the Medal of Honor 32 years later for his heroic actions at the battle.

Casualties were nearly even at 381 for the Union and 371 for the Confederates, but as the battle ended, Warren&#x27;s corps held an important objective, a portion of the Boydton Plank Road at its junction with the Quaker Road. Within hours, Major General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry corps, which was still acting apart from the Army of the Potomac as the Army of the Shenandoah, occupied Dinwiddie Court House. This action also severed the Boydton Plank Road. The Union forces were close to the Confederate line and poised to attack the Confederate flank, the important road junction of Five Forks and the two Confederate railroad lines to Petersburg and Richmond that remained open to the two cities.

On April 2–3, 1865, the Confederates evacuated Petersburg and Richmond and began to move to the west. After a number of setbacks and mostly small battles, but including a significant Confederate defeat at the Battle of Sailor&#x27;s Creek on April 6, 1865, Lee surrendered his army to Grant and his pursuing Union Army on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Lynchburg, Virginia. By the end of June 1865, all Confederate armies had surrendered and the Confederacy&#x27;s government had collapsed.

==Background==
===Military situation===

===Richmond–Petersburg Campaign===

On June 15–18, 1864, two Union Army corps, moved unobserved from the stalemated battle lines just north of Richmond across the James River to the south of Petersburg, Virginia. The Union force which joined with the Union Army of the James at Petersburg failed to seize the city from a small force of Confederate defenders at the Second Battle of Petersburg. By June 18, 1864, the Army of Northern Virginia had reinforced the defenders and the 292-day Richmond–Petersburg Campaign (Siege of Petersburg) had begun.

Grant&#x27;s strategy had to become a campaign of trench warfare attrition in which the Union forces tried to wear down the Confederate Army, destroy or cut off sources of supply and supply lines to Petersburg and Richmond and to extend the lines which the outnumbered and declining Confederate force had to defend to the breaking point.

During the rest of 1864 and early 1865, Grant slowly moved his forces in the Union line south of Petersburg to the west in six more Petersburg offensives, usually with simultaneous attacks at or near the Richmond lines. The Confederates extended their lines to compensate for these moves, but they were stretched increasingly thin. With supplies and men increasingly hard for Lee to obtain or replace, he knew that his army could not defend Petersburg and Richmond from the growing Union forces indefinitely, especially with the expected arrival of Union reinforcements from recent recruits in training, Major General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry divisions from the Shenandoah Valley and possibly even Major General William T. Sherman&#x27;s armies already operating in North Carolina when the roads dried out after spring rains abated.

After the Battle of Hatcher&#x27;s Run on February 5–7, 1865 extended the lines another , Lee had few reserves after manning the new defenses. He then knew that part or all of his army must leave the Richmond and Petersburg lines, obtain food and supplies at Danville, Virginia or possibly Lynchburg, Virginia and join General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s force opposing Sherman&#x27;s army. If the Confederates could quickly defeat Sherman, they might turn back to oppose Grant before he could combine his forces with the remainder of Sherman&#x27;s. Lee began preparations for the movement and informed Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge of his conclusions and plan.

Lee accepted Major General John B. Gordon&#x27;s proposal to attempt to break the Union lines and threaten their supply base at City Point, Virginia by attacking along a narrow front near Fort Stedman, east of Petersburg and south of the Appomattox River, in order to compel Grant to shorten his lines, at least temporarily. If successful, this could give Lee an opportunity to shorten his lines and an opening and head start in a movement to the west and toward North Carolina.

After Gordon&#x27;s Confederates surprise attack on Fort Stedman in the pre-dawn hour of March 25, 1865 had some initial success, a Union counterattack at the Battle of Fort Stedman recaptured the fort and forced the Confederates to return to their lines and give up their advance picket line, including much of the western part of that line in the afternoon at the Battle of Jones&#x27;s Farm. The Confederates suffered about 4,000 casualties which they could ill afford. After the defeat at Fort Stedman, Lee knew that he could not detach part of his army and be able to maintain the defenses of Petersburg and Richmond. He also knew that Grant would soon move against the only remaining Confederate supply lines to Petersburg, the Southside Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road, beyond the end of his current defenses.

===Grant&#x27;s orders===

Grant already had issued orders on March 24, 1865, for an offensive to begin on March 29 and was not deterred by the Battle of Fort Stedman. Grant planned for Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry to cut the remaining open railroads, the Southside Railroad and the Richmond and Danville Railroad to Richmond, and for the infantry to turn the Confederates out of their positions if possible. On March 28, Grant told Sheridan to lead his troops around the Confederate right flank and to fight the Confederates, with infantry support, if the Confederates came out of their trenches. Otherwise, Sheridan should wreck the railroads as much as possible and either return to the Petersburg lines or join Sherman in North Carolina at his discretion.

Grant ordered two corps of the Army of the Potomac, the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur K. Warren and the II Corps under Major General Andrew A. Humphreys, to support Sheridan on his right flank, to the east of his objectives. Grant wanted these infantry corps to outflank the Confederates in their defenses and prevent them from interfering with Sheridan&#x27;s mission, pushing them back to their lines if they came out to fight. Warren&#x27;s corps initially also was ordered to seize Dinwiddie Court House, Virginia, which also would capture a portion of the Boydton Plank Road at that location, but later that task was given to Sheridan.

Under Grant&#x27;s order, on the night of March 27–28, Major General Edward Ord, quietly moved units from the Army of the James, including two divisions of Major General John Gibbon&#x27;s XXIV Corps, a division of Major General Godfrey Weitzel&#x27;s XXV Corps and Brigadier General Ranald S. Mackenzie&#x27;s cavalry division from the Richmond lines to fill in the Petersburg lines to be vacated by the II Corps when they moved to support Sheridan. Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet&#x27;s corps defending the Richmond lines failed to detect Ord&#x27;s movement, thus limiting the number of men Lee could move to counter the movement of Grant&#x27;s forces without fatally weakening the Richmond lines.

===Description of area roads===

A good verbal description of the roads and positions in the area, given by Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain in his 1915 book &quot;The Passing of the Armies&quot;, is recited in the footnote.

===Initial movements: March 29===

Warren&#x27;s V Corps of over 17,000 men moved from their reserve position south of the Union front line on the Stage Road at 3:00 a.m. on March 29, crossed Rowanty Creek and proceeded west on Vaughan Road to the intersection with Quaker Road. Warren reported to his immediate superior, Major General George G. Meade, who remained in direct tactical command of the Army of the Potomac, that Dinwiddie Court House was undefended. By 8:45 a.m., Meade sent an order to Warren which arrived at 10:20 a.m., and told Warren to advance in strength on the Quaker Road across Gravelly Run and contact the II Corps to his right. Warren misunderstood or ignored the order and sent only Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade up the Quaker Road until noon. Then Warren sent other units forward in response to a second order from Meade.

The II Corps moved from Hatcher&#x27;s Run at about 6:30 a.m. Humphreys was careful not to leave a gap between his corps at Hatcher&#x27;s Run and the troops of the XXIV Corps which took the positions in the Union line that were being vacated by the II Corps. Meade wanted the V Corps to move up the Quaker Road to prevent a gap developing between the V Corps and the II Corps.

After having moved over the Vaughan Road to within of Dinwiddie Court House, Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade marched a short distance back to the Quaker Road and led the Union advance north on that road, as Meade had ordered Warren. After leading the brigade about north on Quaker Road, Chamberlain&#x27;s skirmishers reported that the bridge over Gravelly Run had been destroyed and that Confederates were entrenched on the other side.

Confederate Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson, as a corps commander of only the division of Major General Bushrod Johnson, was stationed on the Confederate right flank west of Petersburg at Hatcher&#x27;s Run about east of Five Forks and immediately south of Sutherland Station. When Confederate scouts reported that a large force of Union infantry was moving north on Quaker Road, Anderson ordered Johnson to drive them back to Vaughan Road. Three Confederate regiments of the brigade commanded by Brigadier General Henry A. Wise, followed by the brigades of Brigadier Generals William H. Wallace, Young Marshall Moody and Matt Whitaker Ransom, moved south on the Quaker Road and the Boydton Plank Road with the intent of carrying out the order.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
===Confederate===
==Battle==
===Fighting begins===

Chamberlain placed the 198th Pennsylvania Infantry on the right side of the road to fire on the Confederates as a diversion while he led the 185th New York Volunteer Infantry across Gravelly Run to attack the Confederate right flank where a hand-to-hand fight developed. Both Union regiments were oversize for that time period with about 1,000 officers and men. The rest of Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade crossed the stream following the New Yorkers&#x27; attack. The Confederates retreated to the Lewis farmhouse clearing about further north on the Quaker Road. After a stand near the farmhouse, the Confederates moved back into the woods where they were reinforced by other Confederate soldiers behind breastworks. Here, the Confederates drove back the advancing Union skirmishers but not without losing about 100 men as prisoners. Chamberlain brought the rest of his men forward and the Confederates who had moved out to meet the skirmishers again returned to their works.

===Chamberlain wounded; rallies his men===

After a pause in the fighting, Chamberlain&#x27;s division commander, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin came forward and told Chamberlain that the Confederate position must be taken. Deploying men to both sides of the Quaker Road, Chamberlain, on horseback, led a charge up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate strong point, a large sawdust pile that provided cover for many Confederate soldiers. Chamberlain got ahead of his men and became an obvious target. He was wounded in the arm and his horse was wounded in the neck. Chamberlain slumped on his horse, initially unconscious, but regained consciousness in time to respond to General Griffin who had come up to check on Chamberlain&#x27;s condition. Then Chamberlain rallied his Pennsylvania regiment who were retreating from a Confederate charge. When his wounded horse could not continue, Chamberlain went to the front of his line on foot. Several Confederate soldiers soon appeared and demanded Chamberlain&#x27;s surrender. Chamberlain had lost his hat and was wearing a faded coat, almost gray in color. Pretending to be a Confederate officer, he led the Confederates back toward Union soldiers who promptly captured them.

===Union reinforcements drive back Confederates===

After another brief pause, Chamberlain saw that his New York regiment was being driven back from an attempt to take the Confederate works in the woods ahead. Chamberlain and the regiment&#x27;s officers steadied the men and soon they pushed the Confederates back until Union artillery under Regular Army Lieutenant John Mitchell came up with four guns to support them. Despite the artillery fire, the Confederates tried to outflank and charge the Union position. Chamberlain&#x27;s men and the artillery held the position, but then the Confederates charged the Pennsylvania troops in the center and on the right of the Union position. These Union soldiers were nearly out of ammunition and began to slowly retreat.

As Chamberlain&#x27;s line was falling back, his First Brigade was reinforced by the 188th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 155th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Zouaves) of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory&#x27;s Second Brigade. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson led the Pennsylvanians to the center and toward the sawdust pile that the Confederates were using for cover. Pearson grabbed the regimental colors and charged toward the sawdust pile with his men following and passing through the ranks of the exhausted First Brigade. Thirty-two years later, Pearson was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Lewis&#x27;s Farm.

When they saw these Union reinforcements, the Confederates retreated to their main entrenchments along White Oak Road, abandoning control of the Boydton Plank Road and leaving behind badly wounded men and some others who surrendered. Chamberlain then positioned his men along with the artillery battery on either side and in front of the Lewis farm buildings.

===Number engaged; casualties===

Chamberlain wrote that he had fewer than 1,700 officers and men in his brigade and that his reinforcements numbered about 1,000. He wrote that the Confederates had 6,277 effective officers and men in Johnson&#x27;s Division according to their morning report. He stated that he lost about a quarter of his men while the Confederate total loss was &quot;slight in numbers,&quot; although in a paragraph after this statement he said that he saw that evening 150 dead and severely wounded Confederates lying around the breastworks and noted that almost 200 prisoners had been taken by his brigade. Modern casualty estimates are 381 for the Union force and 371 for the Confederates.

==Aftermath==

===Union positions===

Warren was able to take a position near the junction of the Quaker Road and the Boydton Plank Road. Griffin&#x27;s division and Brigadier General Samuel Crawford&#x27;s division taking up positions along the Boydton Plank Road, the Union movements on March 29 and Chamberlain&#x27;s success in taking the Lewis Farm position enabled the Union Army to cut this important communication and supply road and to set up to attack the White Oak Road Line. Having to deal with muddy roads over a longer route, Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry divisions reached Dinwiddie Court House at about 5:00 p.m. on March 29, 1865. Sheridan put troops of Devin&#x27;s and Crook&#x27;s divisions into position to guard the Vaughan Road, Flat Foot Road, Boydton Plank Road and Adams Road.

===Grant&#x27;s change in orders===

Encouraged by the Confederate failure to press their attack at Lewis&#x27;s Farm and their withdrawal to their White Oak Road Line, Grant decided to expand Sheridan&#x27;s mission to a major offensive rather than just a railroad raid and forced extension of the Confederate line. He wrote in his letter to Sheridan: &quot;I now feel like ending the matter...&quot;

===Lee&#x27;s actions===

Lee had anticipated that with the Confederate defeat at Fort Stedman and the arrival of Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry at Petersburg, Grant would make a move on Lee&#x27;s right flank such as Grant had ordered on March 24. Lee had only 6,000 cavalry north of the James River or at Stony Creek Depot, south of Petersburg and about 5,000 effective infantry that he could send to extend his line to the west to counter the anticipated Union movement. In the morning on March 29, Lee prepared to have Major General George Pickett take this force to Sutherland Station and move to protect Five Forks in Dinwiddie County. Lee ordered Pickett to take the brigades of Brigadier Generals William R. Terry, Montgomery Corse and George H. Steuart on the Southside Railroad to Sutherland Station, west of Petersburg, and he ordered Brigadier General Eppa Hunton to be ready to move to reinforce Pickett or to defend the junction of the Southside and Richmond and Danville Railroads at Burkeville, Virginia. Lee also ordered Major General Fitzhugh Lee to take his cavalry division to Sutherland Station and join with the cavalry divisions of Major Generals Rooney Lee and Thomas L. Rosser. Fitzhugh Lee was ordered to take command of the combined cavalry. General Lee thought that Pickett might be able to extend the Confederate line from its right flank east of Five Forks to Five Forks.

The Union Army movement on March 29 troubled Lee so he ordered additional movements to strengthen his right flank. Besides moving Brigadier General Samuel McGowan&#x27;s brigade farther west to extend Johnson&#x27;s line along White Oak Road, he thinned the White Oak Road line further by moving Brigadier General William MacRae&#x27;s brigade to the west. After arriving at Sutherland Station on the night of March 29, as ordered, Pickett moved his three brigades under Brigadier Generals George H. Steuart and Montgomery Corse and William R. Terry&#x27;s Brigade, and Brigadier Generals Matt Ransom&#x27;s and William Henry Wallace&#x27;s brigades from Johnson&#x27;s division, a cavalry division under Major General Fitzhugh Lee and six guns under the command of Colonel William Pegram to Five Forks on March 30. Then he sent Terry&#x27;s brigade and Corse&#x27;s brigade to the south. Nonetheless, a gap continued to exist between Pickett&#x27;s force and McGowan&#x27;s brigade at the end of the Confederate White Oak Road Line. Lee ordered Hunton&#x27;s brigade to stand in reserve near Manchester, Virginia where it could support Pickett or move by rail to defend the junction of the Southside Railroad and Richmond and Danville Railroad at Burkeville, Virginia if a Union force moved to attack it.

===March 30, 1865 action===

Rain poured down on the area all night on March 29 and continued the following day, which limited the fighting on that day. Sheridan later stated that Grant thought about suspending operations altogether until the weather cleared and the ground dried but Sheridan convinced him to press ahead. On March 30, half of Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry under Brigadier General Thomas Devin skirmished with Confederate cavalry under Fitzhugh Lee. As they approached Five Forks, a patrol of the 6th United States Cavalry Regiment under Major Robert M. Morris encountered Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s troopers and lost 3 officers and 20 men in the encounter. The Confederates also suffered some casualties, including Brigadier General William H. F. Payne who was wounded. Skirmishing with and reacting to feints from Union patrols from the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry under Colonel Charles L. Leiper delayed Pickett&#x27;s force from reaching Five Forks until 4:30 p.m. Rosser&#x27;s and Rooney Lee&#x27;s cavalry divisions arrived even later.

Meanwhile, skirmishers from Warren&#x27;s V Corps kept the Confederates in their White Oak Road Line between the Boydton Plank Road and Claiborne Road. Despite incomplete information and somewhat vague and conflicting orders from Meade and Grant, on Grant&#x27;s order, Warren pushed the Union V Corps forward to strengthen his hold on a part of the Boydton Plank Road and the V Corps entrenched a line to cover that road from its intersection with Dabney Mill Road south to Gravelly Run. In the afternoon, Warren saw Griffin&#x27;s men take over Confederate outposts but he also saw that movement further up the Boydton Plank Road was covered by Confederate artillery and fortifications.

Humphrey&#x27;s II Corps closed the gap between the V Corps and the XXIV Corps. The latter corps captured a large part of the Confederate picket line.

Brigadier General Romeyn B. Ayres&#x27;s division of the V Corps made a reconnaissance toward the White Oak Road a short distance west of Claiborne Road. The lead brigade under Colonel Frederick Winthrop crossed a swollen branch of Gravelly Run which was to feature in the following day&#x27;s battle. Two other brigades did not cross but began to entrench. Ayres saw only empty space to the northeast and failed to see heavy fortifications near the intersection of White Oak Road and Claiborne Road which angled sharply back to Hatcher&#x27;s Run directly to his north. As dark approached, Ayres had a number of outposts prepared to cover his position. Union casualties for the March 30 actions at the White Oak Line were 1 killed, 7 wounded and 15 missing; the number of Confederate casualties is unknown.

===Prelude to March 31, 1865 battles===

The fighting, maneuvering and skirmishing at Lewis&#x27;s Farm on March 29, 1865, and in the vicinity of that farm along the White Oak Road Line on March 30, 1865, set the stage for the Battle of White Oak Road and the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House on March 31, 1865.

<doc id="1133057" wikidata="Q454017" url="?curid=1133057" title="Fulk III, Count of Anjou">
<text>Fulk III, the Black ( 970–1040; ) was an early Count of Anjou celebrated as one of the first great builders of medieval castles. It is estimated Fulk constructed approximately 100 castles as well as abbeys throughout the Loire Valley in what is now France. He fought successive wars with neighbors in Brittany, Blois, Poitou and Aquitaine and made four pilgrimages to Jerusalem during the course of his life. He had two wives and three children.

Fulk was a natural horseman and fearsome warrior with a keen sense of military strategy that bested most of his opponents. He was allied with the goals and aims of the Capetians against the dissipated Carolingians of his era. With his county seat at Angers, Fulk&#x27;s bitter enemy was Odo II of Blois, his neighbor 128 km east along the Loire river, at Tours. The two men traded towns, followers and insults throughout their lives.

Fulk finished his first castle at Langeais, 104 km east of Angers, on the banks of the Loire. Like many of his constructions, it began as a wooden tower, and was eventually replaced with a stone structure, fortified with exterior walls, and equipped with a thick-walled tower called a &quot;donjon&quot; in French (source of the English word &quot;dungeon&quot;, which, however, implies a cellar rather than a tower). He built it in the territory of Odo I, Count of Blois, and they fought a battle over it in 994. But Odo I died of a sudden illness, and his son and successor, Odo II, did not manage to evict Fulk.

Fulk continued building more towers in a slow encirclement of Tours: Montbazon, Montrésor, Mirebeau, Montrichard, Loches, and even the tower of Montboyau, erected just across the Loire from Tours in 1016. He also fortified the castles at Angers, Amboise, Chateau-Gontier, Chinon, Mayenne and Semblançay, among many others. &quot;The construction of castles for the purpose of extending a ruler&#x27;s power was part of Fulk &quot;Nerra&quot; strategy,&quot; wrote Peter Fraser Purton, in &quot;A History of Medieval Siege, c. 450–1220&quot;.

Fulk was also a devout Christian who built, enlarged or endowed several abbeys and monasteries, such as the Abbey of Beaulieu-lès-Loches, Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, Saint-Aubin, and a convent, Notre Dame de la Charité, at Ronceray in Angers. Although he never learned to write, he endowed a school with revenue to provide poor students with an education. Fulk also undertook four pilgrimages to Jerusalem.

== Family ==
Fulk was the son of Geoffrey I of Anjou, also known as Geoffrey &quot;Grisegonelle&quot;, and Adele of Meaux, daughter of Robert of Vermandois, Count of Meaux and Troyes, and Adelaide of Burgundy. He had an older sister, Ermengarde-Gerberga of Anjou, who married Conan of Brittany, and a younger brother, Geoffrey. A half-brother, Maurice, was born in 980.

Fulk married Elisabeth of Vendôme (c. 979–999), daughter of Count Bouchard of Vendôme, and they had one daughter, Adèle, who married Bodon, son of Landry, Count of Nevers. Their eldest son, Bouchard, inherited Vendôme. Elisabeth&#x27;s death was recounted in the &quot;Chronicles of Saint-Florent&quot;: Elisabeth occupied the citadel at Angers with some supporters and while under siege from Fulk, she fell from a great height, and then was burnt at the stake for adultery.

Fulk subsequently married Hildegarde of Sundgau, whose family was from Lorraine, around December 1005. They had two children:
*Geoffrey II, in 1006, who became known as Geoffrey Martel and succeeded Fulk as Count of Anjou in 1040.
*Ermengarde-Blanche, born sometime in 1017.

== Combat ==
Fulk Nerra&#x27;s first victory was in June 992 at the Battle of Conquereuil, where he managed to defeat Conan I, Duke of Brittany. Conan&#x27;s territorial ambitions had been quashed by Geoffroy Grisgonelle in 980, and seven years later, he planned an ambush on Angers while Fulk was attending the crowning of Robert the Pious. Fulk and his men foiled the ambush, killing Conan&#x27;s son, Alain, in the process. In 992 Fulk laid siege to Conan&#x27;s castle at Nantes, but he slipped away to Conquereuil. Conan was killed in the subsequent battle, and Fulk installed a governor/regent, as the succeeding count was a child.

While Fulk and Odo II fought many skirmishes over territory and alliances, their biggest battle occurred in July 1016 at the Battle of Pontlevoy. Odo marched 10,000 men southward toward Fulk&#x27;s tower at Montboyau; meanwhile, Fulk and his much smaller group attacked him from behind. Fulk&#x27;s men were routed, retreated, and Odo, thinking the battle won, went for a swim in the Cher River. Reinforcements led by Count Herbert Wake-Dog of Maine arrived to help Fulk, routing Odo&#x27;s surprised men. Several thousand were reported killed.

== Pilgrimages ==
Fulk also undertook four pilgrimages to Jerusalem—the first and second as a penitent seeking forgiveness for sins, and the third and fourth to protect pilgrims. In 1003, Fulk traveled to Jerusalem for his first pilgrimage. The voyage crossed the Alps at the Grand Bernard Pass in present-day Switzerland, then overland to Bari in the southern Italian peninsula (a stop in Rome was usually made) and by ship to the Holy Land. The journey took as long as six months, through deeply dangerous territory.

Fulk made a second pilgrimage in 1008, obliged to do so by the king as punishment after Fulk ordered the murder of an enemy. For his third and fourth trips, Fulk had a moral obligation to protect pilgrims in the years following the desecration of Jerusalem by the &quot;Mad Caliph&quot; Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and provided armed security against robbers, murderers and enslavers along the route. In 1035, he embarked upon a third pilgrimage with Robert I, Duke of Normandy, and in 1038, he made his final pilgrimage. He died in Metz in 1040 on his return from that trip, and was buried in the chapel of his monastery at Beaulieu.
== Succession ==
His son Geoffrey II (Geoffrey Martel) succeeded him as Count of Anjou in 1040 and held the title until 1060. Since he had no living male children from either of his two marriages, the title to Anjou passed to his nephews, the two sons of his sister Ermengarde-Blanche (m. Geoffroy V of Château-Landon), upon his death. Geoffroy III &quot;Le Barbu&quot; (the Bearded) was Count of Anjou from 1060 to 1068; Fulk IV Réchin (the Mouth) was count from 1068 to 1109. Fulk IV&#x27;s grandson, Geoffrey Plantagenet, married Matilda, heir to the English throne, and began the House of Plantagenet line of English kings.

<text>The 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers) was a regiment of the British Army raised by the Honourable East India Company in 1742. It transferred to the command of the British Army in 1862. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 103rd Regiment of Foot in 1881 to form the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.

==History==
===Formation===
The regiment was raised by the Honourable East India Company as the Madras Europeans from independent companies in 1742 – &quot;European&quot; indicating it was composed of British soldiers, not Indian sepoys. It saw action at the siege of Arcot in autumn 1751 during the Second Carnatic War and went on to fight at the Battle of Plassey in June 1757, the Battle of Condore in December 1758 and the Battle of Wandiwash in January 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. It also fought at the siege of Pondicherry in September 1760 during the Third Carnatic War. It became the 1st Madras Europeans, on formation of the 2nd and 3rd Madras Europeans, in 1766. It went on to become the 1st Madras European Regiment in 1774. After that it took part in the siege of Nundydroog in October 1791 and the siege of Seringapatam in February 1792 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War.

===Early nineteenth century===
The regiment next took part in expedition to the Dutch East Indies seeing action at the capture of Amboyna in February 1796 and its recapture in February 1810, the capture of Ternate in April 1801 and its recapture in August 1810 and the capture of Banda in March 1796 and its recapture in August 1810.

===The Victorian era===
The regiment returned to India in 1816 and took part in the Battle of Mahidpur in December 1817 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. It was deployed to Burma in 1824 for service in the First Anglo-Burmese War: it formed part of an army which advanced up the River Irrawaddy to the Kingdom of Ava. It returned to India arriving in Madras in 1826. It transferred to Malacca in 1835 and became the 1st Madras (European) Fusiliers in 1843. After returning to India in early 1852 it was deployed to the Province of Pegu in April 1852 during the Second Anglo-Burmese War.

The regiment fought at the siege and relief of Lucknow in November 1857 during the Indian Rebellion. Three members of the regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during the siege. After the Crown took control of the Presidency armies in the aftermath of the Rebellion, the regiment became the 1st Madras Fusiliers in July 1858 and then the 1st Royal Madras Fusiliers in May 1861. It was then renumbered as the 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers) on transfer to the British Army in September 1862. The regiment embarked for England in 1870 and was then deployed to Gibraltar in April 1876 and to Ceylon in 1879.

As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 102nd was linked with the 103rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Bombay Fusiliers), and assigned to district no. 66 at Naas Barracks in County Kildare. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 103rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Bombay Fusiliers) to form the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.

=== Plassey the tiger ===

The 102nd kept a tiger, named Plassey, during their deployments in India and the regiment&#x27;s garrison at Dover. Named after the Battle of Plassey, the Bengal tiger cub was among a pair captured by Captain Frank Thackwell of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, and later gifted to the 102nd. Plassey was among the other mascots of the 102nd, that being a dog and an antelope. Plassey came to be such a symbol of the regiment that the cap badge showed him. After the regiment was shipped back to Europe, Plassey stayed with the Dover garrison, where he lived alongside a pair of leopards. However, after having &quot;alarmed&quot; residents, Plassey was sent to the London Zoo, where he died in 1877.

==Battle honours==
Battle honours won by the regiment were:

==Victoria Crosses==
*Private Thomas Duffy, Indian Mutiny (6 September 1857)
*Private John Ryan, Indian Mutiny (26 September 1857)
*Private John Smith, Indian Mutiny (16 November 1857)

==Colonels of the Regiment==

;102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers)
*1862–1881: Gen. Sir Robert Vivian, GCB

<doc id="1133059" wikidata="Q1783139" url="?curid=1133059" title="ClamWin Free Antivirus">
<text>ClamWin Free Antivirus was a free and open-source antivirus tool for Windows. It provides a graphical user interface to the Clam AntiVirus engine. The software has not been updated since 2021.

== Features ==
* Scanning scheduler (only effective with user logged in).
* Automatic virus database updates on a regular basis.
* Standalone virus-scanner.
* Context menu integration for Windows Explorer.
* Add-in for Microsoft Outlook.
* A portable version that can be used from a USB flash drive.

There are Firefox extensions that allow the users to process downloaded files with ClamWin.

=== No real-time scanning ===
ClamWin Free Antivirus scans on demand; it does not automatically scan files as they are read and written.

The non-affiliated projects Clam Sentinel and Winpooch are add-ons that provide a real-time scanning capability to ClamWin.

== Effectiveness ==
Historically, ClamWin Free Antivirus has been criticized for its poor detection rates and slow scans compared to other antivirus programs. In past evaluations, it struggled significantly in detecting various types of malware. For example, in 2009, ClamWin Free Antivirus failed to detect almost half of the trojan horses, password stealers, and other malware in AV-TEST&#x27;s &quot;zoo&quot; of malware samples.

In the 1–21 June 2008 test performed by Virus.gr, ClamWin Free Antivirus version 0.93 detected 54.68% of all threats and ranked 37th out of 49 products tested, with the highest-ranking product detecting over 99% of threats. Similarly, in the 10 August-5 September 2009 test, ClamWin Free Antivirus version 0.95.2 detected 52.48% of all threats and ranked 43 out of 55 products tested, where the best performer scored 98.89%.

These evaluations are over a decade old. In recent years, ClamWin has seen several updates, though comprehensive independent test results from major antivirus testing organizations are scarce. Users should consider that ClamWin remains primarily a free, open-source antivirus solution, which might not offer the same level of comprehensive protection as some commercial products.

Despite the absence of new effectiveness information from major testing organizations, ClamWin continues to be a popular choice for users seeking a free and open-source antivirus solution. Users looking for more robust protection may need to consider additional security measures or alternative antivirus solutions.

In 2011, cNet gave ClamWin Free Antivirus a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, acknowledging its user-friendly interface and regular updates but also noting its relatively slower scanning speeds and lower detection rates compared to other antivirus software.

==Books==

===&quot;Corporate Warriors&quot;===
His first book, &quot;Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry&quot; (Cornell University Press, 2003, ), was the first to explore the new industry of private companies providing military services for hire, an issue that soon became important with the use and abuse of these companies in Iraq. The book was named best book of the year by the American Political Science Association, among the top five international affairs books of the year by the Gelber Prize, and a &quot;top ten summer read&quot; by &quot;Businessweek&quot;.

===&quot;Children at War&quot;===
Singer&#x27;s next book, &quot;Children at War&quot; (Pantheon, 2005), explored the rise of another new force in modern warfare, child soldier groups. The book was one of the winners of the 2006 Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book of the Year Award.

===&quot;Wired for War&quot;===

&quot;Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century&quot; (Penguin, 2009, ) is a best-selling book by P. W. Singer. It explores how science fiction has started to play out on modern day battlefields, with robots used more and more in war. Singer&#x27;s 2009 book tour included stops on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, the &quot;Daily Show&quot; with Jon Stewart, the opening of the TED conference, the Royal Court of the United Arab Emirates and presentations at 75 venues around the United States.

===&quot;Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know&quot;===
&quot;Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2014, ) is a book by P. W. Singer and Allan Friedman. The book explores how the Internet and cybersecurity works, why it matters, and what can be done. It was featured on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, CNBC Squawkbox, the SXSW conference, and named to the official reading lists for the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy.

===&quot;Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War&quot;===

&quot;Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War&quot; (Eamon Dolan/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2015, ) is Singer&#x27;s first novel, co-written with August Cole. The book created the concept of FICINT, short for &quot;Fictional Intelligence.&quot; FICINT has been defined by the authors as &quot;a hybrid of narrative and research analysis, designed both to entertain and educate.&quot; Using the format of a novel, Ghost Fleet melded nonfiction style research on emerging trends and technology with a fictional exploration of what war at sea, on land, in the air, space, and cyberspace will be like in the future. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described it: &quot;Tom Clancy fans will relish Singer and Cole&#x27;s first novel, a chilling vision of what might happen in a world war.&quot; The book was subsequently placed on the reading list of organizations ranging from all the US military services to the CIA and Royal Air Force. The US Navy also later named a robotic ship program &quot;Ghost Fleet.&quot;

=== &quot;LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media&quot; ===
&quot;LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media&quot; (Eamon Dolan/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018, ) is a book by P. W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking. The book examines the history of communications, the rise of open-source intelligence, the failed promise of cyber-utopianism, the advent of internet-based information warfare, and the growing political influence of Silicon Valley. Singer and Brooking identify a new mode of conflict, &quot;LikeWar&quot;, in which competing viral phenomena influence the outcome of both military operations and political campaigns. Singer has described &quot;cyberwar&quot; as hacking computer networks and &quot;likewar&quot; as hacking people on them, &quot;where the object is to drive something viral through a mix of likes, shares, and sometimes lies.&quot; In a starred review, &quot;Booklist&quot; described it as, &quot;required reading for everyone living in a democracy and all who aspire to,&quot; while Amazon and Foreign Affairs named it a book of the year.

=== &quot;Burn-In: A Novel of the Real Robotic Revolution&quot; ===
&quot;Burn-In: A Novel of the Real Robotic Revolution&quot; (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2020, ) is the second novel of &quot;useful fiction&quot; by Singer and August Cole. It used the format of a technothriller to share 300 nonfiction insights about the trends of AI and automation and their political, economic, and social effects.

On December 15, 2020, it was announced that a drama based on the novel was in development by CBS with Rideback as the production company and Robert Doherty, Daniel Lin, Lindsey Liberatore, P.W. Singer, and August Cole as executive producers.

<doc id="1133080" wikidata="Q5686433" url="?curid=1133080" title="Haydn Bunton Jr.">
<text>Haydn Austin Bunton (born 5 April 1937) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach. The son of the legendary Haydn Bunton Sr., Bunton Jr. played for and in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), as well as and in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL).

Bunton was regarded as a tough and skilful player in both South Australia and Western Australia, but it was as a coach that he cemented a reputation alongside his father as one of Australian football&#x27;s greatest identities.

Bunton was inducted into the coaches section of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, as well as the Western Australian Institute of Sport Hall of Champions in 2003 and was made an inaugural member of the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SA Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

== Playing career ==
Born in Caulfield, Victoria, Bunton Jr. moved with his father first to Western Australia and then to South Australia. Bunton was hospitalised for two years from the age of three due to a fractured pelvis and Perthes disease in his hip. He wore leg braces and used crutches until he was aged ten.

Haydn Bunton junior made his debut for at the age of 17, and two years seasons later was named an All-Australian player. In 1955, Bunton senior was killed in a car crash, but the following year, the younger Bunton showed his class as a player by finishing runner-up for the Magarey Medal to Dave Boyd. The following year, Haydn &quot;stood out&quot; as a player due to a transfer dispute with North Adelaide, who would not clear him, but amazingly served as a non-playing coach of . From 1958 to 1960, he played for Norwood, in spite of a serious knee injury sustained in a car accident in Tasmania in 1959.

Bunton had another strong year in 1961, when he was recruited by Swan Districts in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) as captain-coach. At the time Swan Districts were the Cinderella side of the WAFL, having never won more than seven games in a season since 1946, and were generally regarded with &quot;pity or scorn&quot;. Swan Districts had lost their last sixteen games of 1960, but improved immediately under Bunton&#x27;s coaching. They won twelve and drew two of twenty-one matches to finish second, but after a loss to raging-hot premiership favourite East Perth in the second semi-final they were not considered a serious threat. However, after overcoming Subiaco in the preliminary, Bunton developed an ingenious tactic to counter Royals&#x27; champion Polly Farmer by using both Keith Slater and Fred Castledine in the ruck contests. Though this ploy was technically illegal, it was accepted by the umpires, and Swan Districts won by 24 points for their first WAFL premiership. In the process of lifting Swan Districts from cellar-dwellers to premiers, Bunton developed a use of handball that was far ahead of its time and also discouraged the use of the erratic drop kick.

The following year Bunton won the Sandover Medal for the league&#x27;s &quot;fairest and best&quot;, completing a rare father-and-son achievement. Swan Districts took their first minor premiership and won both the second semi and grand finals against East Fremantle. Despite finishing fourth after the home-and-away rounds, Swan Districts managed to win three finals and a hat-trick of premierships in 1963; however, 1964 saw the team collapse to sixth of eight clubs with only nine wins.

Bunton returned to Norwood as playing coach from 1965 until 1967, bringing his total number of games for Norwood to 97. In his first season the club played off in the finals, but they slowly declined in 1966 and 1967 finishing seventh of ten teams.

==Coaching career==
After 1967, Bunton accepted another major challenge when he accepted an appointment as playing coach of Subiaco, for whom his father had won three Sandover Medals, but which had been almost continuously a cellar-dweller for thirty years. Between 1937 and 1967, Subiaco had played in only four senior finals series and overall managed just 186 wins and four draws from 577 senior games for a success rate of 32.58 per cent.

===Subiaco, 1968 to 1972===
In 1967, Subiaco had won only three of 21 games to be four games clear on the bottom, but, aided by an amazing season from full forward Austin Robertson junior, they won twelve games in 1968 to finish fourth, but did not beat top three teams Perth, East Perth and West Perth during perhaps the most uneven season in any of the VFL/AFL, SANFL or WANFL. Bunton played for two more seasons during which Subiaco again lost the first semi-final (though it was their first consecutive seasons in the finals since 1935 and 1936), but stayed on as non-playing coach during 1971 and 1972.

During these two seasons, Subiaco disappointed, winning only eighteen of forty-two games and finishing fifth and sixth in an eight-team competition. However, when Subiaco won its first premiership since 1924 under new coach Ross Smith, it was generally acknowledged that Bunton had played a critical role in raising the team from last to first over the six seasons between 1967 and 1973. During this time, he played a leading role in completely banishing the drop kick from football.

===South Adelaide, 1975 to 1982===
After a two-year sabbatical, Bunton returned to coach South Adelaide in 1975. As with Subiaco, the Panthers had struggled severely ever since World War II, playing in the finals only during the three years of Neil Kerley&#x27;s tenure as captain-coach. Unlike Subiaco, South Adelaide&#x27;s improvement under Bunton&#x27;s patented methods of fast, skilful football was gradual, but the Panthers played in the major round for the first time in eleven years in 1977 and two years later played in only their second grand final since the war and last to date as of 2023.

However, on a muddy ground and extremely windy if dry day Port&#x27;s experience and luck with the toss told: the Magpies&#x27; five goals with the breeze was more than South could manage for a day when not one goal was kicked against the wind and by the last quarter South had little left in them, losing by the score of 3-14 (32) to 9-9 (63). The Panthers did, however, win the NFL night series with VFA and WAFL clubs plus representative teams from &quot;developing&quot; football states in both 1978 and 1979. However, despite playing in the finals and achieving South Adelaide&#x27;s best minor round since 1964 in the 1981 season, a decline to third last in 1982 saw Bunton replaced by Graham Cornes for 1983.

===Subiaco, 1984 to 1992===
In 1984, Bunton junior returned to his former haunt of Subiaco, who as a result of the loss of such players as Mike Fitzpatrick had endured another bleak era over the previous nine seasons. The Lions had not participated in the finals since 1974 and had finished dead last in 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1982, when they were in danger of a winless season before beating East Fremantle in the seventeenth round. Since 1975 Subiaco had recorded only 44 wins from 189 games and had lost its &quot;average&quot; game over these nine seasons by a margin of 36 points.

However, under Bunton and aided by a powerful country zone, the Lions improved rapidly: from four wins and a percentage of 70 in 1983 they went to nine wins and a percentage of 100 in 1984 and fifteen wins and a percentage of 124.5 in 1985. Despite being in their first finals series since 1974, the Lions only just failed to beat East Fremantle in the grand final and gained ample revenge against the Sharks the following year by eleven and a half goals. Their team was sufficiently good to be competitive against VFL premiers Hawthorn in a post-season &quot;challenge&quot; match—ironically Hawthorn&#x27;s win was led by Subiaco&#x27;s one star of the bleak late 1970s and early 1980s in Gary Buckenara.

An irrepressible Claremont outfit under the innovative coaching of Gerard Neesham halted Subiaco in 1987, but the following year after losing the second semi to the Tigers and being unconvincing in the preliminary against East Fremantle, the Lions, playing a much more traditional game than Claremont and aided by the controversial inclusion of West Coast Eagle Laurie Keene, ran away to win by 62 points after an even first half.

The massive drain of players to the VFL meant Subiaco could not keep up this standard, and they won only six games each in 1989 and 1990 before returning to the Grand Final in 1991 only for Claremont to have its revenge. A thrashing by East Perth in the first week of the 1992 WAFL finals saw Bunton resign at the end of the season after having coached Subiaco&#x27;s most successful era since before World War II.

===Sturt, 1993 to 1994===

At the age of fifty-six, Bunton was appointed by a Sturt club looking for an experienced coach after Kevin Higgins and Steven Trigg had guided them to only seven wins from 64 games between 1990 and 1992. Sturt had actually possessed interest in Bunton during the early 1980s when they were seeking a replacement for veteran coach Jack Oatey, but lost interest when a decision had to be made at the end of 1982.

Bunton started very badly, with the Double Blues having lost as many as twenty consecutive games before their first win in July. However, they managed to win four of their last eight games but narrowly failed on percentage to avoid a fifth successive wooden spoon. In 1994, things started promisingly with two wins and a near miss against reigning premiers the Eagles before Sturt fell back to its old ways and won only two of its last seventeen games for a sixth wooden spoon on end. Bunton resigned at the end of 1994 to be replaced by Phil Carman, who resurrected the club after on paper the worst modern season in a major Australian rules league the following year.

Bunton&#x27;s stint at Sturt is generally regarded as his only failure as a coach, though he admitted he enjoyed it, that the Sturt district was &quot;not as productive as it used to be&quot; and that SANFL redistricting had hurt the club.

<doc id="1133081" wikidata="Q137769" url="?curid=1133081" title="Fu Manchu (band)">
<text>Fu Manchu is an American stoner rock band formed in Orange County, California in 1985. The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout the 80s and 90s, but has remained consistent since 2001. The band currently consists of founding guitarist turned lead vocalist Scott Hill, bassist Brad Davis, lead guitarist Bob Balch and drummer Scott Reeder.

Fu Manchu have been long associated with the Palm Desert Scene, alongside bands such as Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss and Mondo Generator. &quot;Monster Riff&quot; has described the band as &quot;one of the most loved and revered... bands in the stoner rock world.&quot;

==History==
Fu Manchu originally formed in 1985 as a hardcore punk band called Virulence. The lineup was vocalist Ken Pucci, guitarist Scott Hill, bassist Mark Abshire, and drummer Ruben Romano. In 1987, Abshire left the band and was replaced by Greg McCaughey. They recorded their debut LP &quot;If This Isn&#x27;t a Dream...&quot; in 1988, which was released on Alchemy Records (1989). In 1990, Pucci left the band and was replaced by vocalist Glenn Chivens, and they changed their name to Fu Manchu. Soon after, they released the &quot;Kept Between Trees&quot; 7 inch single on Slap-a-Ham Records. McCaughey was replaced by Mark Abshire. Chivens also left the band around this time for unknown reasons. Rather than search for a new vocalist, Scott Hill became lead singer, and Scott Votaw was recruited as lead guitarist. In 1992, Fu Manchu released three 7 inch singles: &quot;Senioritis&quot;, &quot;Pick Up Summer&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Knockin&#x27; (If This Vans Rockin&#x27;)&quot;. In 1993, Votaw left the band and was replaced by lead guitarist Eddie Glass, who had previously played drums in the band Olivelawn.

Fu Manchu&#x27;s first album, &quot;No One Rides for Free&quot; (1994), was released by Bong Load Custom Records, an independent label. &quot;No One Rides for Free&quot; marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s heavy focus on muscle cars and drag racing, common themes in the stoner rock genre.

Abshire left Fu Manchu before they recorded their second album, &quot;Daredevil&quot;, in 1995. He was replaced by Brad Davis. The band promoted &quot;Daredevil&quot; with extensive touring throughout the US and Canada, and reached a wider audience thanks to an opening slot with Monster Magnet, who at the time were the commercial darlings of the stoner rock genre.

Romano and Glass left shortly after the release of Fu Manchu&#x27;s third album, &quot;In Search of...&quot; (1996), citing personal and musical differences with Hill. They were replaced by Brant Bjork and Bob Balch, respectively. Glass, Romano and Abshire soon regrouped to form Nebula, a power trio that took the jam-influenced side of Fu Manchu and expanded on it. Members of Nebula have commented that &quot;we&#x27;re all family&quot; to fans wearing Fu Manchu shirts at their concerts.

Fu Manchu went on to release several successful albums and reinforce their reputation as a powerful live act. The band had gained this reputation over the years due to their performance when touring with notable bands such as Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Marilyn Manson, Clutch, Corrosion of Conformity, White Zombie, Sevendust, and P.O.D., among others.

In 2001, the band released an album, &quot;California Crossing&quot;. Brant Bjork left the band soon after to pursue a solo career and was replaced by former Sunshine and Smile drummer Scott Reeder (often confused with bassist Scott Reeder, of Kyuss, Unida, and Goatsnake fame). In 2004, Fu Manchu released their eighth album, &quot;Start the Machine&quot;.

Fu Manchu&#x27;s ninth album is called &quot;We Must Obey&quot; which was released on February 19, 2007. The band spent most of 2007 and 2008 on tour, playing several shows in North America and Europe.

In February 2008, the track &quot;Mongoose&quot; (from the &quot;California Crossing&quot; album) was featured in a Super Bowl ad for the Toyota Sequoia.

Their tenth album &quot;Signs of Infinite Power&quot; was released on October 19, 2009, in Europe and October 20 in North America.

On March 10, 2010, it was announced that Scott Reeder would play drums for Social Distortion for the South American tour dates in April.
In June 2012, the band stated they had begun writing for a new record. In 2014, the band released its eleventh album, &quot;Gigantoid&quot;.

In December 2017, they announced their twelfth album, &quot;Clone of the Universe&quot;, which released on February 9, 2018.

In March 2024, Fu Manchu announced their thirteenth studio album, &quot;The Return of Tomorrow&quot;, a double album which was released on June 14. The single &quot;Hands of the Zodiac&quot; was released the same day. Hill commented on the band&#x27;s choice to record a double album, saying &quot;we should do a double record with 7 heavy fuzzy songs on one record and the other record 6 mellow(er) songs...&quot;

<text>Ingelger (died 888), also called Ingelgarius, was a Frankish nobleman, who was the founder of the County of Anjou and of the original House of Anjou. Later generations of his family believed that he was the son of Tertullus (Tertulle) and Petronilla.

Around 877, he inherited his father Tertullus&#x27; lands in accordance with the Capitulary of Quierzy, which Charles the Bald had issued. His father&#x27;s holdings from the King included Château-Landon in , and he was a in the Gâtinais and Francia. Contemporary records refer to Ingelger as a , a great military man. 

Later, in accordance with family tradition, his mother was made a relative of Hugh the Abbot, an influential counselor of both Louis II and Louis III of France, from whom he received preferment. By Louis II Ingelger was appointed viscount of Orléans, which city was under the rule of its bishops at the time. At Orléans Ingelger made a matrimonial alliance with one of the leading families of Neustria, the lords of Amboise. 

He married Adelais, whose maternal uncles were Adalard, Archbishop of Tours, and Raino, Bishop of Angers. Later Ingelger was appointed prefect (military commander) at Tours, then ruled by Adalard.

At some point, Ingelger was appointed Count of Anjou, at a time when the county stretched only as far west as the river Mayenne. Later sources credit his appointment to his defense of the region from Vikings, but modern scholars have been more likely to see it as a result of his wife&#x27;s influential relatives.

Ingelger was buried in the Church of Saint-Martin at Châteauneuf, Allègre, France. He was succeeded by his son Fulk the Red.

<text>Viktor Savelyevich Onopko (; born 14 October 1969) is a former Russian football defender. He is the assistant manager of both FC Rostov in the Russian Premier League and the Russia national team.

As a player, Onopko held the record for most international appearances for the Russia national team until 2015.

==Club career==
Onopko&#x27;s career as a player started in 1986. During that time, he played for Shakhtar Donetsk, Spartak Moscow, Real Oviedo, Rayo Vallecano, Alania Vladikavkaz and Saturn Ramenskoye. He retired as a player in 2005.

==International career==
Eligible to play for both the Ukrainian and Russian national teams, Onopko chose the latter (unlike his brother Sergey, who opted to play for Ukraine). He amassed 109 caps (plus 4 for the CIS, including in the 1992 Euros). He played in the 1994 and 2002 world cups, as well as 1996 Euros. Onopko was in the preliminary squad for Euro 2004 but was dropped due to injury. With the national team, in 2003 he won the Cyprus friendly tournament

After retiring, in 2009, he was part of the Russia squad that won the 2009 Legends Cup.

==Coaching career==
Onopko worked for 11 years as an assistant coach for CSKA Moscow.

On 26 July 2021, he was hired as an assistant to Valeri Karpin in the Russia national team.

In February 2022, after FIFA and UEFA suspended Russian clubs and the national teams from international competitions amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Karpin returned as manager to FC Rostov and hired Onopko as his assistant there as well.

==Personal life==
Onopoko was born in Voroshilovgrad (now called Lugansk) in the Soviet Union. Following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, he acquired both Ukrainian and Russian citizenships.

Viktor has a younger brother, Serhiy, who also played as a professional footballer.

<doc id="1133088" wikidata="Q1042929" url="?curid=1133088" title="Elastic scattering">
<text>Elastic scattering is a form of particle scattering in scattering theory, nuclear physics and particle physics. In this process, the internal states of the particles involved stay the same. In the non-relativistic case, where the relative velocities of the particles are much less than the speed of light, elastic scattering simply means that the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved. At relativistic velocities, elastic scattering also requires the final state to have the same number of particles as the initial state and for them to be of the same kind.

==Rutherford scattering==
When the incident particle, such as an alpha particle or electron, is diffracted in the Coulomb potential of atoms and molecules, the elastic scattering process is called Rutherford scattering. In many electron diffraction techniques like reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), transmission electron diffraction (TED), and gas electron diffraction (GED), where the incident electrons have sufficiently high energy (&gt;10 keV), the elastic electron scattering becomes the main component of the scattering process and the scattering intensity is expressed as a function of the momentum transfer defined as the difference between the momentum vector of the incident electron and that of the scattered electron.

==Optical elastic scattering==
* In Thomson scattering light interacts with electrons (this is the low-energy limit of Compton scattering).
* In Rayleigh scattering a medium composed of particles whose sizes are much smaller than the wavelength scatters light sideways. In this scattering process, the energy (and therefore the wavelength) of the incident light is conserved and only its direction is changed. In this case, the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the reciprocal wavelength of the light.

==Nuclear particle physics==
For particles with the mass of a proton or greater, elastic scattering is one of the main methods by which the particles interact with matter. At relativistic energies, protons, neutrons, helium ions, and HZE ions will undergo numerous elastic collisions before they are dissipated. This is a major concern with many types of ionizing radiation, including galactic cosmic rays, solar proton events, free neutrons in nuclear weapon design and nuclear reactor design, spaceship design, and the study of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. In designing an effective biological shield, proper attention must be made to the linear energy transfer of the particles as they propagate through the shield. In nuclear reactors, the neutron&#x27;s mean free path is critical as it undergoes elastic scattering on its way to becoming a slow-moving thermal neutron.

Besides elastic scattering, charged particles also undergo effects from their elementary charge, which repels them away from nuclei and causes their path to be curved inside an electric field. Particles can also undergo inelastic scattering and capture due to nuclear reactions. Protons and neutrons do this more often than heavier particles. Neutrons are also capable of causing fission in an incident nucleus. Light nuclei like deuterium and lithium can combine in nuclear fusion.

<doc id="1133093" wikidata="Q6189807" url="?curid=1133093" title="Jewish Currents">
<text>Jewish Currents is an American progressive Jewish quarterly magazine and news site whose content reflects the politics of the Jewish left. It features independent journalism, breaking news, political commentary, analysis, and a &quot;countercultural&quot; approach to Jewish arts and literature.

==Publication history==
The magazine was first published in November 1946 by the Morning Freiheit Association under the name Jewish Life and was associated with the Communist Party USA. In 1956 it broke with the Party and took its current name. From 1959 to 2000, it was edited by Morris U. Schappes. Following Schappes&#x27; retirement in 2000, Editor Emeritus Lawrence Bush grew and sustained the magazine for almost two decades, writing columns such as &quot;Religion and Skepticism,&quot; contending playfully with many manifestations of the &quot;spirituality&quot; of contemporary American culture. Other regular columns under Bush&#x27;s tenure included &quot;Jewish Women Now,&quot; &quot;It Happened in Israel,&quot; &quot;Inside the Jewish Community,&quot; &quot;Our Secular Jewish Heritage,&quot; &quot;Around the World,&quot; and &quot;Mameloshn: Yiddish Poetry.&quot; From March–April 2005 until the March-April 2009 issue, &quot;Jewish Currents&quot; was distributed to all members of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle as a benefit of membership.

In 2018, the magazine hired a new editorial team composed entirely of millennial Jews.

As of 2022, the magazine had 5,200 print subscribers and more than a million online readers each year. Its budget is $1.6 million, drawing on its $1 million endowment as well as contributions from individuals and foundations to support 12 full-time staffers. Arielle Angel is editor-in-chief.

In 2021, the magazine apologized to readers for running an advertisement for the Dorot Fellowship, a leadership training program in Israel for American Jews. Some on the left said the ad was proof that the magazine was secretly Zionist.

==Editorial position==
Concentrating on breaking news, analysis, culture, art and more, the magazine is aimed at progressive Jews, and to be the voice of that community in the broader American left. &quot;Jewish Currents&quot;″ relaunch in 2018 resulted in the rapid growth of the magazine and its community across the US and internationally. Bernie Sanders wrote an essay for the revamped magazine on his relationship with Judaism. Alongside a book review by Judith Butler, the magazine drew attention with pieces by these high-profile individuals.

The magazine emerged as a leading voice of the American Jewish left. Its editorial voice, led by contributors such as Peter Beinart, is strongly critical of Israel and advocates positions such as the Palestinian right of return, and boycotting Israeli businesses in the occupied West Bank.

<doc id="1133095" wikidata="Q526100" url="?curid=1133095" title="Fulk I, Count of Anjou">
<text>Fulk I of Anjou ( 870 – 942), known by the nickname  (&quot;Fulk the Red&quot;, i.e. &quot;Red Falcon&quot;), was a Frankish nobleman who held several titles in West Francia, including Viscount and later Count of Tours from 905, Count of Nantes from 910 to 919, and the first Count of Anjou from 929 until his death.

==Life==
Born about 870, Fulk was the son of Ingelger of Anjou and Adelais of Amboise. He was the first Count of Anjou, ruling the county from about 908 to 942. In 899 he became Viscount of Tours and in 905 Count of Tours. In about 910 he was Count of Nantes. He increased his territory as a viscountcy of Angers and, around 929, he claimed the title Count of Anjou. During his lordship, he was frequently at war with the Normans and the Bretons. He occupied the county of Nantes in 907, but abandoned it to the Bretons in 919. Fulk I died around 942.

==Family==
Fulk married Roscille de Loches, daughter of Warnerius (Widone), Seigneur de Loches, de Villentrois, and de la Haye, and his wife Tecandra. He and Roscille had:

* Guy (Wido), Bishop of Soissons ( 970).
* Fulk II. Succeeded his father as Count of Anjou.

<doc id="1133097" wikidata="Q2707556" url="?curid=1133097" title="Iberian horse">
<text>The Iberian horse is a designation given to a number of horse breeds native to the Iberian Peninsula. At present, some breeds are officially recognized by the FAO, while other horses believed to be native to the peninsula are not. Likewise, some modern breeds are understood from mitochondrial DNA to be descended from historic landraces, while others have origins outside the Iberian peninsula. The remaining FAO-recognized breeds are of well-known foreign blood, or are recently developed breeds.

==History==

Cave paintings show that horses have been present on the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 20,000 to 25,000 BCE. Iberian horses are thought to be among the oldest types of domesticated horses. DNA studies indicate certain breeds have ancestry that can be traced to wild horses that lived about 6200BCE, in the Early Iberian Neolithic period. There is a past hypothesis that the Sorraia may have been an ancestor of several modern breeds, and it is possible as their haplotype is found throughout the Iberian horse population, though it is not as frequently found as other mDNA lineages. Thus current evidence suggests they are not as closely related as once thought. However, the problem is that the Sorraia has endured a major genetic bottleneck since ancient times, and only two DNA founder lineages remain, so it is not possible to determine if certain haplotypes in various breeds descend from other lines now extinct in the Sorraia.

Roman writers mention in Hispania war horses, wild horses, &quot;tieldones&quot; and small &quot;asturcones&#x27;&quot; in the north. 

Two distinct phenotypes of Iberian horse were identified in early research: so-called &quot;Celtic&quot; ponies, centered in the Cantabrian Range in the north, and the horses of the south, represented today by the Andalusian and Carthusian, Lusitano, Marismeño and related breeds, many of which have a Baroque horse phenotype. The northern breeds include the Garrano, Pottok, and Asturcon, all of which are considered endangered breeds.

Throughout history, Iberian horses have been influenced by many different peoples and cultures who occupied Spain, including the Celts, the Carthaginians, the Romans, various Germanic tribes and the Arabs. The Iberian horse was identified as a talented war horse as early as 450 BCE. Mitochondrial DNA studies of the modern horses of the Iberian peninsula and Barb horse of North Africa present convincing evidence that horses crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in both directions and crossbred. It is not possible to determine which of these strains is the older one, and both trace to the Roman era, far earlier than the Muslim conquest of Spain that is commonly assumed to mark the beginning of such crossbreeding.

At one time, the northern Celtic horses were thought to have ancestry related to the Exmoor pony of the British Isles, but subsequent Mitochondrial DNA studies revealed that the populations are not closely related until there was some documented admixture between Exmoors and Celtic horses in the early-to-mid 20th century. If anything, the Iberian breeds are characterized by a &quot;consistent absence of geographical structure&quot;.

When the Spanish reached the Americas in the late 15th century, they brought various horses of Iberian ancestry with them. Their descendants have been designated as the Colonial Spanish Horse and have contributed significantly to a number of horse breeds in both North and South America.
In modern times, stallions from outside breeds were crossed on local breeds, such as the Exmoor pony stallions brought to the area, or for example, the heavy Burguete and Jaca Navarra breeds crossed on foreign stallions to create a bigger animal more useful for the horsemeat industry.

In Spain and Portugal, the 1980s marked the start of efforts to bring back several of the Northern Iberian breeds from extinction, some of which were down to a few dozen individuals. The Cartusian strain of Pure Spanish (Andalusian) horse was also endangered, with a breeding population of about 150 animals. In 2005, a distinctive primitive, feral breed was identified inside Doñana National Park, the Retuerta horse (Caballo de las retuertas).

<doc id="1133101" wikidata="Q881141" url="?curid=1133101" title="Matt Blunt">
<text>Matthew Roy Blunt (born November 20, 1970) is an American politician and former naval officer who served as the 54th governor of Missouri from 2005 to 2009. He previously served ten years in the United States Navy and as Missouri secretary of state.

Blunt won the 2004 Missouri gubernatorial election as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee Claire McCaskill. The election coincided with elections in the Missouri General Assembly, where Republicans maintained their majority; this made Blunt the first Republican governor to serve with a Republican legislature in 84 years, making his policy proposals easier to accomplish. At age 33, he also became the second-youngest person ever elected governor of Missouri after Kit Bond. Blunt did not seek a second term as governor, announcing his decision on January 22, 2008.

After working as a consultant, Blunt was hired as the president of the American Automotive Policy Council in 2011, representing the auto lobby in Washington, D.C. His father, Roy Blunt, has served in a variety of political offices, including as Missouri secretary of state and congressman, and in the U.S. Senate from 2011 to 2023.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1970 in Greene County, Missouri, Blunt is the son of politician Roy Blunt and his first wife Roseann Ray Blunt. The senior Blunt was first elected to office in 1984 as secretary of state for Missouri. He was elected as U.S. representative in 1997 and as U.S. senator in 2010. After graduating from Jefferson City High School in Jefferson City, Missouri, Matt Blunt was accepted into the United States Naval Academy, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1993.

Blunt and his wife Melanie were married in May 1997. The couple has two sons, William Branch Blunt, born on March 9, 2005, and Brooks Anderson Blunt, born on January 1, 2010. Blunt is a member of the State Historical Society of Missouri, the American Legion, and the Missouri Farm Bureau.

==Naval career==
As an officer in the United States Navy, Blunt served as an engineering officer aboard the USS &quot;Jack Williams&quot; and as the navigator and administrative officer on the destroyer USS &quot;Peterson&quot;.

His active duty service included participation in Operation Uphold Democracy, involving the United Nations blockade of Haiti, missions to interdict drug traffic off the South American coast, and on duties involved in the interdiction of Cuban migrants in 1994. During his Naval career, Blunt received numerous commendations, including four Navy and Marine Corps Achievement medals. He entered the Navy Reserve.

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Blunt was called back into active naval service, after he had been elected to the office of secretary of state for Missouri. He completed a six-month tour of duty in Great Britain during Operation Enduring Freedom, during which time he continued to work full-time for the state as well. He was a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy Reserve.

==Early political career==

In 1998, Blunt was elected as a Republican to the Missouri House of Representatives to represent the 139th legislative district for a two-year term. In 2000, he was elected Missouri Secretary of State; although only a first-term state representative, Blunt defeated the Democratic Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, Steve Gaw, with 51.4% of the vote to Gaw&#x27;s 45.1%. Blunt was 29 on election day, November 7, 2000, and 30 at the time he assumed office, making him the youngest person ever to win statewide office in Missouri. His father had been elected to the same office at age 34. Blunt was the only Republican elected to statewide office in Missouri in 2000.

In August 2001, as secretary of state, Blunt traveled to Israel along with a delegation of Republicans led by his father, Roy, to meet with Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon. He promoted a state election reform bill in 2002, which won support of the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic House. In 2004, Blunt required all electronic voting machines purchased by the state to produce a voter-verified paper ballot.

==Governor of Missouri==
===2004 election===

Blunt faced only token opposition in the Republican primary, which he won with 534,393 votes (68.28%). In the general election, he faced Missouri State Auditor Claire McCaskill, who had defeated incumbent governor Bob Holden in the Democratic primary.

The first of two debates between Blunt and McCaskill was held on 18 October where McCaskill compared her experience to Blunt&#x27;s inexperience; while Blunt said that McCaskill would not support the Marriage protection amendment to the State Constitution. In the two debates Blunt described himself as bringing change to Missouri and was assisted by President George W. Bush during the campaign. McCaskill kept her distance from Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry due to Bush&#x27;s lead in Missouri.

In the end Blunt narrowly defeated McCaskill with surveys showing his conservative stance on social issues and the strong showing of President Bush in Missouri helped him to victory. Blunt obtained strong leads in the rural parts of the state which was sufficient to overcome McCaskill&#x27;s leads in St. Louis and Jackson County. Blunt defeated McCaskill by 1,382,419 votes (50.83%) to 1,301,442 (47.85%) and thus became Missouri&#x27;s second-youngest Governor.

===Tenure===
When Blunt took office on January 10, 2005, it was the first time in Missouri since 1921 that a Republican held the governor&#x27;s office with Republican majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Blunt and his allies in the Missouri General Assembly moved quickly to enact legislation that they said would create a positive business climate in the state and result in job growth.

With legislative support, Blunt claimed in 2009 that he had enacted almost all of his policy proposals. Among the legislation passed were tort reform measures that overhauled the state&#x27;s legal system, and changes in the state&#x27;s workers compensation laws.

Blunt&#x27;s first year in office was difficult, and he was criticized by both the right and the left. In February 2006, a poll conducted by SurveyUSA showed him with a 33% job approval rating, the fifth lowest of any governor in the nation. His approval among Republicans polled was 62%, but his rating among Democrats was only 12%. This was one of the greatest partisan divides of any governor.

In September 2009, the state insurance agency issued a report showing medical malpractice claims in Missouri at a 30-year low in 2008, believed to result from Blunt&#x27;s restriction of injury settlements under tort reform in 2005. &quot;...Missouri&#x27;s medical malpractice insurers made a profit for the fifth straight year in 2008. It also shows an increase in the number of medical providers getting insurance through nonprofit coalitions.&quot;

===Fiscal policy===
Blunt believed he had to reduce spending to deal with what he described as a state financial crisis. He trimmed state spending in order to keep the budget balanced without raising taxes. Particularly controversial were provisions reducing coverage of programs created by state legislation to provide a social net, especially to families.

Two years later, with an election almost a year away, Governor Blunt implemented the MO HealthNet Initiative, Senate Bill SB577. This was intended to offer residents more choices and rewards for healthy behavior. Some citizens were deemed qualified again for Medicaid coverage.

In July 2007, Blunt signed an executive order launching the Missouri Accountability Portal (MAP), which provides Missourians with free, immediate, online information about how the state spends taxpayer money.

Blunt signed into law tax cuts. Blunt created the Quality Jobs program, an initiative has been expanded by his successor, Governor Jay Nixon.

In 2005, Blunt and the Republican-controlled Missouri General Assembly enacted an overhaul of the state workers&#x27; compensation system, making it more difficult for employees to obtain workers&#x27; compensation benefits. The overhaul was supported by business interests and opposed by labor unions. Also in 2005, Blunt signed into law &quot;tort reform&quot; legislation that limited the damages that juries could award in medical malpractice, placed a cap on punitive damages, lowered the maximum amount that juries could award in non-economic damages, and repealed Missouri&#x27;s shared liability law. In 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court struck down the cap on medical malpractice damages, ruling that the measure infringed &quot;on the jury&#x27;s constitutionally protected purpose of determining the amount of damages sustained by an injured party.&quot;

===Legislative initiatives===
Blunt provided annual increases in state funding for K-12 education, signed legislation authorizing $335 million for college construction, expanded college scholarships, and enacted a new school funding method. Blunt proposed selling Missouri&#x27;s student loan agency, known as MOHELA, and using the proceeds to pay for endowments and new construction for the state&#x27;s public universities. In the area of elementary and secondary education, Blunt has proposed that school districts be required to spend at least 65% of their budgets on student instruction. After the proposal was criticized, Blunt suggested that the 65% threshold should be a goal, rather than a mandate.

Blunt signed bills to expand Missouri&#x27;s right-to-carry firearms. At the NRA&#x27;s annual meeting, held in St. Louis in 2007, Blunt signed legislation prohibiting the seizure of firearms during declared states of emergency.

Blunt opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. He supported measures to prevent the ban on research regarding somatic cell nuclear transfer. There were efforts to pass such a ban in the Missouri General Assembly during the 2005 session. Disagreements among Republicans over the stem cell issue held up efforts to pass restrictions on abortion, such as a 24-hour waiting period, and a restriction on helping minors cross state lines to avoid Missouri&#x27;s parental consent requirement. In September 2005, Blunt called a special session of the General Assembly specifically to address abortion. The General Assembly passed the above-noted restrictions, and Blunt signed them into law. Blunt supported measures that would allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception, in contrast to Illinois, which enacted legislation requiring pharmacies as public businesses to fill such prescriptions.

In 2005, Blunt signed legislation to limit sales of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine products, the key ingredients needed to make methamphetamine. In the 2006 legislative session, Blunt&#x27;s stated priorities included enacting a version of &quot;Jessica&#x27;s Law,&quot; requiring a minimum 25-year sentence for child sex offenders, as one of his legislative priorities. In 2008, Blunt signed legislation requiring ignition interlocks for drunk drivers who commit two or more drunk driving offenses. He signed legislation to lower the legal intoxication limit for boaters from .10 to .08 percent.

Blunt ended localities&#x27; reliance on requiring many victims of sexual assault or rape to pay for their own forensic examinations; he secured $2.8 million in the state budget to pay for the rape kits. Blunt secured funding which led to the creation of the new Springfield Crime Lab.

Blunt signed an immigration bill prohibiting &quot;sanctuary cities&quot; in Missouri; requiring verification of legal employment status for public employees through E-verify; allowing cancellation of state contracts for contractors that hire illegal immigrants; requiring public agencies to verify the legal status of applicants before providing welfare benefits; criminalizing the transportation of illegal immigrants for exploitative purposes; and enacting provisions to punish employers who willfully hire illegal immigrants.

In 2006, Blunt signed legislation requiring gasoline sold in Missouri to contain 10% ethanol. Blunt has supported the development of biomass, biofuels, wind power and solar energy as alternative energy sources. Air quality continues to be a problem for the state, which has a high rate of air pollution due to burning of coal.

In his 2008 State of the State address, Blunt proposed a one-week state sales tax exemption on Energy Star-certified new appliances. Missouri became the fourth state in the nation to enact such a tax break. Also in 2008, Blunt and Arkansas Democratic governor Mike Beebe signed an historic bi-state water quality agreement to protect watersheds and aquifers that cross state lines.

===Executive actions===
Blunt issued Executive Orders and programs to encourage university cooperation, tax relief, research funds and seed capital for &quot;life science&quot; start-up firms, and an innovative program to reward insurance companies and other large institutional investors for investing in funds that hold biotech stocks.

Blunt has promoted Missouri as a potential hotspot for bioscience. He was criticized for limiting science funding for research related to stem cells; this was considered to discourage the science community at large from working in the state. In 2005 Governor Blunt created the Missouri Life Sciences Trust Fund, to accept transfers of monies from the Tobacco Settlement fund and apply them to biotech efforts. In January 2006 Gov. Blunt created the Lewis and Clark Discovery Initiative (LCDI), designed to spread biotechnology across the State. The LCDI is funded by the Missouri higher-education learning assistance fund (MOHELA).

===Alleged misuse of state offices===
In August 2007, a reporter for the &quot;Springfield News-Leader&quot; filed to gain access to emails by Ed Martin, Blunt&#x27;s chief of staff, under the state&#x27;s Sunshine Law. He was investigating whether Martin had used his office to try to influence anti-abortion groups in relation to opposition to state Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat. Nixon was expected to run against Blunt in the 2008 gubernatorial election. Martin responded on September 4 that he had no such emails, but the reporter later said someone gave him a copy of one, showing that Martin&#x27;s claim was false.

At the same time, &quot;Blunt spokesman Rich Chrismer insisted to reporters that &#x27;there is no statute or case that requires the state to retain individual&#x27;s e-mails as a public record.&#x27; Blunt himself told reporters that his staffers would not be required to save e-mails for three years,&quot; although this was &quot;widely understood to be state law&quot; (known as the Sunshine Law). It was later revealed that Scott Eckersley, a deputy chief counsel, provided copies of language in the state employees&#x27; handbook to general counsel Henry Herschel on September 10 about this state requirement to save such materials. Eckersley was soon locked out of his office by order of Martin.

On September 28, 2007, the governor&#x27;s office fired Eckersley, a political appointee. It distributed packets of emails and documents to four major newspapers in Missouri to support its claims that the attorney had made inappropriate use of a state computer. Eckersley said he was terminated for other reasons, related to trying to ensure employees complied with the state&#x27;s email retention policy under its Sunshine Law. In the first known &quot;whistleblower&quot; case against the Missouri state government, Eckersley filed suit for wrongful termination and defamation of character against Blunt and his senior appointees.

Due to concerns expressed to his office in November 2007 that there were actions underway to overwrite email tapes and the governor&#x27;s office was not complying with the Sunshine Law, AG Jay Nixon appointed special investigators on November 15 to study what was taking place. Nixon&#x27;s team had to go to court in the spring of 2008 to get a ruling on whether the governor&#x27;s office was required to comply with their requests for information, at the expense of the state. Through various legal maneuverings, the court ruled in favor of the investigation, appointing two Special Attorneys General to lead it. The governor never was deposed. Eventually the completion of the investigation was extended to February 2009 because of the volume of materials that needed to be reviewed. &quot;The Kansas City Star,&quot; &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; and Associated Press filed petitions in August 2008 as intervening plaintiffs to gain preliminary and injunctive relief, declaratory judgment that the emails were public records under the state Sunshine Law, and access to the emails under discussion.

Martin resigned in November 2007 as chief of staff, without explanation. Blunt&#x27;s General Counsel Henry Herschel left soon after. On January 22, 2008, Blunt surprised voters, &quot;staffers and supporters&quot; by announcing he would not run for another term, although he reportedly already had millions of dollars in a war chest for his upcoming campaign. More than a year later and after Blunt had left office, &quot;An investigation by state officials later found that the governor&#x27;s office failed to properly disclose Mr. Martin&#x27;s emails.&quot; This investigation, which cost the state $2 million, found that Martin had illegally destroyed some emails, in violation of the state&#x27;s open government or Sunshine Law. It also found he had used his office to influence outside groups against opponents of Blunt.

After a year-long legal effort, in November 2008, the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; and &quot;St. Louis Post Dispatch&quot; reported having gained access to 60,000 pages of Blunt administration emails. Their analysis showed that Ed Martin, former chief of staff to Blunt, had used his state office to try to influence outside political groups, among other internal problems. In addition to trying to encourage opposition to AG Jay Nixon, Martin worked with political groups to oppose the appointment of Patricia Breckenridge to an open seat on the Missouri Supreme Court. (Blunt has supported her and she later gained the seat.) Emails indicate that Leonard Leo was one of the influences corresponding with Martin, as a part of a strategy to dismantle the Missouri Plan.

On May 22, 2009, the Missouri Attorney General&#x27;s office announced that Eckersley&#x27;s lawsuit against Blunt and others had been settled for $500,000.

===Favorability===
His approval ratings gradually rose during his term in office. A February – March 2008, poll by the Republican polling firm American Viewpoint showed Blunt with an approval rating of 57%. On January 22, 2008, Blunt surprised the GOP when he announced he would not run for re-election. Polls showed that he was running behind the presumptive Democratic nominee, Attorney General Jay Nixon.

==Other activities==
As Governor, Blunt was a member of the National Governors Association, Southern Governors&#x27; Association, and the Republican Governors Association.

As Commander-in-Chief of the Missouri National Guard, Governor Blunt visited Missouri National guard troops serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Kuwait, and on the Mexican border.

Because he had been called for active duty while serving as secretary of state, Blunt&#x27;s office responded to questions about what would happen if the governor were called to service. In accordance with Pentagon regulations and the Missouri Constitution, if Blunt was called for military duty while governor, he would have been required to either transfer his gubernatorial powers to Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder, or resign from the Naval Reserve.

==Career after governorship==
Prior to his appointment as president of the American Automotive Policy Council in 2011, Blunt served as a member of the board of Copart, an auto salvage company in Fairfield, California; an advisor for Solamere Capital, a suburban Boston private equity firm started by Tagg Romney; a consultant for Cassidy &amp; Associates, a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm, and a partner with The Ashcroft Group, the Washington, D.C., and St. Louis-based consulting firm founded by former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. Blunt has continued to advocate for greater transparency in government spending, state and national lawsuit reform and improving public education.

Blunt has been critical of cuts to education funding, arguing that they will erode Missouri&#x27;s future. He wrote, &quot;States will either be welfare states that protect welfare programs, or they will be education states that prepare for the future.&quot; He has also questioned the proposal to cut state scholarship funding for private colleges, writing in an op-ed, &quot;I have been surprised to see those private schools and their students become a scapegoat as the state cuts education funding and scholarships.&quot;

===President of the American Automotive Policy Council===
In February 2011, Matt Blunt was selected as president of the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC). The AAPC is a policy association created by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. The council, is a bipartisan 501(c)6 based in Washington, D.C., and its mission is to promote the unique and significant economic contribution of the U.S.-based auto companies to the American economy. Blunt&#x27;s leadership at one of the United States&#x27; top automobile and component-producing states is a major reason he was chosen to lead the policy initiatives of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler.

<doc id="1133102" wikidata="Q6815098" url="?curid=1133102" title="Membership of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons">
<text>Membership of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons (MRCS) is a postgraduate diploma for surgeons in the UK and Ireland. Obtaining this qualification allows a doctor to become a member of one of the four surgical colleges in the UK and Ireland, namely the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The examination, currently organised on an basis, is required to enter higher surgical training (ST 3+) in one of the Royal colleges. Thus today&#x27;s MRCS has replaced the former MRCS(Eng), MRCS(Ed), MRCS(Glas), and MRCS(I). (Similarly, the MRCP is also now intercollegiate.)

==History==
Each college used to hold examinations independently, which is what the post-nominal &quot;MRCS&quot; used to indicate, for example, MRCS (London) specifically. After decades of discussion of possible intercollegiate MRCS and FRCS, they were implemented in the 21st century, at first by unifying the syllabus of the separate qualifications of MRCS(Eng), MRCS(Glas), MRCS(Ed), and MRCS(I). In January 2004, the four colleges switched over to a common examination, known as the Intercollegiate MRCS.

==Examination==
The MRCS qualification consists of a multi-part examination including both theory and practical assessments. Part A is a 5-hour examination which assesses the applied basic sciences (a 3-hour paper in the morning) and principles of surgery in general (a 2-hour paper in the afternoon) using multiple-choice Single Best Answer only. It has a passing mark around 71% and pass rate of around 30 per cent. Maximum number of attempts for Part A is 6 and there are usually 3 sittings per year in January, April and September. Part B is a 4-hour practical examination which assesses elements of day-to-day surgical practice through 17 stations of 9 minutes each (with additional resting and preparation stations) on anatomy, pathology, critical care, clinical procedures and patient evaluation (history taking, clinical examination and communication skills). Each station carries a maximum of 20 marks and an additional global rating by the examiner. It has a pass rate of around 50 per cent. Maximum number of attempts for Part B is 4 and there are usually 3 sittings per year in February, May and October. Current curricula have changed to introduce the completion of both exams as a mandatory requirement to complete core surgical training prior to application to higher surgical training (ST3) in the UK. Trainees often require multiple attempts at the examination in order to pass.

==Examination preparation==
A large and varied collection of commercial revision resources are available which can improve a candidate&#x27;s chances of success. These resources include courses, books, online question banks and mobile applications.

<text>Fulk II of Anjou ( 905 – 960), called (&quot;the Good&quot;), was Count of Anjou from 942 to his death.

==Life==
Fulk II, born , was a son of Fulk the Red and his wife Roscilla de Loches, daughter of Warnerius, Seigneur de Villentrois. He succeeded his father in 942 as the second Count of Anjou, and remained in power until 960. 

By this time, the Angevins, Fulk II included, had become particularly adept at establishing marriage alliances that furthered their goals. His father, Fulk the Red, had arranged his marriage to Gerberga, daughter of Geoffrey of Nevers and Aba. Among other things, this alliance enabled Fulk to open the doors towards Aquitaine for his daughter, Adelaide-Blanche, to marry a future king of France (Aba was likely a daughter of William I, Duke of Aquitaine, and Engelberga, thus of royal blood) and for his son Guy to become Bishop of le Puy.

After Gerberga&#x27;s death , Fulk made another astute political marriage to the widow of Alan II, Duke of Brittany. Alan II had also been Count of Nantes and through this marriage Fulk gained influence in, and possibly control of, Nantes. His second wife was also the sister of Theobald I, Count of Blois, which permitted Fulk II to form an alliance with the House of Blois. He is said to have ordered the murder of Drogo, Duke of Brittany, Alan II&#x27;s son with the latter, according to the &quot;Chronique de Nantes&quot;.

==Family==
By his spouse Gerberge, Fulk II had several children:
* Adelaide-Blanche of Anjou, married four or five times.
* Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou, married Adelaide of Vermandois.
* Bouchard, Count of Vendome.
* Guy of Anjou, Bishop of le Puy.
* Humbert d&#x27;Anjou, mentioned 957.

Fulk II had no known issue with his second wife.

==Death==
Fulk died in 960. He was succeeded by his son Geoffrey Greymantle.

<text>Geoffrey (Geoff) Jenkins is a climatologist and former head of climate change prediction at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, part of the Met Office.

==Career==
Jenkins is a physics graduate from Southampton university; PhD in atmospheric physics. Thirty years at the Met Office.

In response to why he believes that human activity has caused the recent rise in temperatures he responded:

Feeding in the different agents that cause climate change into our models – like greenhouse gases, output from the Sun, volcanoes - we’ve looked at the patterns of change they cause across the surface of the Earth and through the atmosphere. We compare them to what’s actually been observed and find the best match between computer simulations and the observations. This has indicated to us that over the past 30 or 40 years that most of the warming has been due to human activities.

<doc id="1133109" wikidata="Q7329783" url="?curid=1133109" title="Richard Wallace (journalist)">
<text>Richard Wallace (born 1961) was the editor of British newspaper the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; until May 2012.

==Early career==
Wallace began his Fleet Street career working for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;. In 1990 he joined the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. During Piers Morgan&#x27;s editorship of the paper he became show business editor, before becoming head of news in 2000. Notable among Wallace&#x27;s scoops was the news that actor Ross Kemp was leaving the BBC soap opera EastEnders in favour of working for rival channel ITV. He was also responsible for the creation of the gossip columnists The 3AM Girls.

In 2002 he swapped jobs with the paper&#x27;s New York editor, Andy Lines. Ten months later, in 2003, he became deputy editor of the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

==Editor==
Wallace was appointed editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 2004 on the dismissal of well-known editor Piers Morgan for publishing false images of British soldiers in Iraq. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; was named Newspaper of The Year at the What the Papers Say Awards in December 2006.

&quot;The Mirror&quot; was one of several newspapers which paid &quot;substantial&quot; damages for defamation for their December 2010 coverage of the arrest of Christopher Jefferies in connection with the Murder of Joanna Yeates; Jeffries subsequently being exonerated. The publishers of the &quot;Mirror&quot; were later prosecuted for contempt of court for the way they had reported Jefferies&#x27; arrest, and fined £50,000. Their appeal against the fine was rejected by the Supreme Court. During the Leveson Inquiry, established by Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the British media following the &quot;News of the World&quot; phone hacking affair, Wallace described the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of Jefferies&#x27;s arrest as a &quot;black mark&quot; on his editing record.

In May 2012, Wallace was sacked as editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. after Trinity Mirror decided to merge the Daily &amp; Sunday Mirror titles and slash editorial budgets.

==Later career==
In September 2012 he joined Simon Cowell&#x27;s entertainment company Syco as a consultant.

In 2013 Cowell appointed him Syco&#x27;s Executive Producer on the company&#x27;s hit show America&#x27;s Got Talent, broadcast on NBC.

In October 2017 Wallace was made Senior Vice President (TV &amp; Production) for Syco.

==Personal==
He married long-time partner Tina Weaver, former Editor of the Sunday Mirror, in June 2016 at Aynhoe Park, Oxford.

<doc id="1133115" wikidata="Q2928797" url="?curid=1133115" title="Bustin' Out">
<text>Bustin&#x27; Out is the second studio album by American country rock band Pure Prairie League. Originally released by RCA Records in late 1972, the album garnered renewed interest almost three years after its release. By then, band leader Craig Fuller was no longer in the band due to draft board issues.

&quot;Amie&quot; was first released as a single in 1973 and failed to chart. In early 1975 it again began receiving airplay mostly on college radio stations and then on major U.S. radio stations. It hit #27 by May 1975. On the album, &quot;Falling In and Out of Love&quot; ends in a segue to &quot;Amie&quot;, which then concludes with the main chorus of &quot;Falling In and Out of Love.&quot; Because of this interrelationship, the pair of songs are sometimes played as a single track.

The album features a guest appearance by Mick Ronson who provided string arrangements on the tracks &quot;Boulder Skies&quot; and &quot;Call Me, Tell Me.&quot;

<doc id="1133118" wikidata="Q2630006" url="?curid=1133118" title="Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia">
<text>The Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (, &quot;&quot;, abbreviated as , ) was composed of military and civilian collaborators with Nazi Germany from territories of the Soviet Union, most of them being ethnic Russians, and was the political authority of the Russian anti-Soviet movement aligned with the Axis powers. It was founded by General Andrey Vlasov on 14 November 1944, in Prague, occupied Czechoslovakia, which was purposely chosen because it was a Slavic city that was still under Axis control. Vlasov had received the permission to establish the Committee from &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler.

The goals of the committee were embodied in a document known as the Prague Manifesto. The manifesto&#x27;s fourteen points guaranteed the freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly, as well as a right to self-determination of any ethnic group living in territories belonging to Russia; based on the right to self-determination, the Vlasovites planned to dissolve the Soviet Union and create independent nation states, including a separatist Russian nation-state. Ideologically, the Vlasov movement was between the Russian nationalism of the NTS, as its ideologues surrounded Vlasov with the support of the Nazis, and the other POWs which held to more social democratic views; some of Vlasov&#x27;s close associates like , the main ideologue of his movement and the Russian Liberation Army, described themselves as Marxists. The Prague Manifesto supported a social system based on private agriculture and disbandment of the collective farms while keeping the industry nationalized; the Vlasovites opposed their program both to Stalinism and capitalism. The Prague Manifesto did not contain any explicit anti-semitic or other racially inspired rhetoric, which caused a conflict with the Nazis (see below). However, criticism aimed at the Western Allies (specifically US and UK) was included in the manifesto&#x27;s preamble. 

In January 1945 Vlasov&#x27;s Russian Liberation Army was began to be organized into several divisions, though not all of them finished forming due to the collapse of the German war effort, and other Russian volunteer units serving in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS were nominally transferred to its command in April 1945 as the &quot;Armed Forces of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia.&quot; The latter included Cossack forces aligned with Timofey Domanov, which had gathered in northern Yugoslavia by May 1945. In the chaotic final months of the Third Reich, the divisions under Vlasov&#x27;s direct command tried to gather in western Czechoslovakia and Austria after briefly engaging the Red Army in Operation April Storm during its advance on Berlin. The Russian troops sided against the Germans during the Prague Uprising, before leaving the city due to the Red Army approaching Prague. After trying to surrender to the United States Army, many of its members either surrendered to the Soviets or were later repatriated to the Soviet Union by the Western Allies.

After the surrender of Germany to the Allies, the committee ceased to operate. During the immediate post-war period, several new organisations sprang up that intended to continue the committee&#x27;s goal of fighting communism (i.e., the Union of the St. Andrew Flag; the Committee of United Vlasovites; the Union of Battle for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia), started by veterans of the committee and the Russian Liberation Army who managed to escape forced repatriation to the Soviet Union. Two latter organisations participated in US-led efforts to form a united anti-Soviet platform of Soviet emigres.

In the United States, a CIA-led organisation with a similar name, the American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, was founded in the late 1940s, and became known for their propaganda broadcaster Radio Liberty, which was run by the Central Intelligence Agency and later funded by the United States Congress. It operated from Munich, in West Germany. Members of the Vlasovite organisations established after the war contributed to the American Committee.

==Formation==

Andrey Vlasov, a Red Army general who had been captured in 1942 and defected to the Germans, had no success in getting support for a Russian national army from the senior German leadership until the summer of 1944, when the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, took interest in his cause. He had a six hour meeting with Himmler on 16 September 1944, getting his approval to form an army, and it began to be assembled on 28 January 1945. The Prague Manifesto, stating the ideology of the Committee for the Liberation for the Peoples of Russia, was announced on 14 November 1944 in Prague. The meeting was not attended by Himmler, but the German government representatives at the Prague conference were Werner Lorenz from the German Foreign Ministry and Wilhelm Frick, the governor of Bohemia and Moravia. A total of 37 people signed the Prague Manifesto, including Red Army defectors, Soviet professors, White emigrés, and ordinary civilians. Vlasov became the chairman of the KONR and the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces (VS KONR).

Additional meetings of the Committee, which eventually expanded to 102 members, took place in Berlin on 18 November and 17 December 1944, and in Prague on 27 February 1945. After the meeting in Prague only the Presidium of the KONR was convened.

==Armed Forces==
Under the command of the Armed Forces of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (abbreviated VS KONR) were the following:
*1st Division of the Russian Liberation Army, commanded by Sergei Bunyachenko
*2nd Division of the Russian Liberation Army, commanded by Grigory Zverev
*3rd Division of the Russian Liberation Army, commanded by Mikhail Shapovalov
*Air force of the KONR, commanded by Viktor Maltsev
*Russian Corps in Yugoslavia, commanded by Boris Shteifon 
*XV Cossack Cavalry Corps, commanded by Ivan Kononov
*Separate Cossack Corps, commanded by Timofei Domanov
*1st combined officer school of the Russian Liberation Army, commanded by Mikhail Meandrov
*Various other independent units

==Ideology and organization==

The Prague Manifesto laid out Andrey Vlasov&#x27;s political and economic program for Russia in the event of the defeat of the Soviet Union. The manifesto claimed that World War II was a conflict being fought by the &quot;imperialist powers&quot; of Britain and the United States, and the &quot;internationalist&quot; powers led by Joseph Stalin, against &quot;freedom-loving nations,&quot; and made no reference to Nazi Germany. It said that the Russian Revolution in 1917 was legitimate, but its progress was criminally usurped from the Russian people by the &quot;Bolsheviks&quot;; the revolution, however, was not divided into the February Revolution and the October Revolution, and the figure of Vladimir Lenin was not criticized in the documents of the KONR nor did it have any assessment, first of all, because the leadership of the KONR avoided splitting the movement on such questions as the attitude towards the October Revolution and Leninism and wanted to maintain the alliance between various opinions, and secondly, because the leaders of the KONR were products of the Soviet society, and they agreed with many aspects of the Soviet system. The manifesto set out its goals as the restoration of freedom of speech, religion, assembly, and of the press, the defense of private property, and the abolition of forced labor. Furthermore it called for the creation of a Russian Liberation Army to overthrow the &quot;tyranny created by Stalin&quot; and sought an &quot;honorable peace&quot; with Germany. There also was an undated memorandum, possibly a draft of a formal agreement, in which the KONR gave up Crimea to Germany and also promised autonomy to the Cossacks and to other groups within Russia.

The Nazis were suspicious of Vlasov, his organisation and his ideological position, and the Gestapo warned about the possibility of the Vlasovites betraying the Reich. The suspicions and criticism of the Vlasovites from the Reich officials was summarised in a document by the Ministry of Propaganda official Eberhard Taubert who described his concerns about the movement being &quot;not National Socialist&quot;: &quot;It is significant that it does not fight Jewry, that the Jewish Question is not recognized as such at all&quot;; instead it presented &quot;a watered-down infusion of liberal and Bolshevik ideologies&quot;, and Taubert described the concern with &quot;strong Anglophile sympathies&quot; and it &quot;toying with the idea of a possible change of course&quot; while not &quot;feel[ing] bound to Germany&quot;.

The Committee was organized into a Central Administration, Military Section, Civilian Department, Propaganda Section, Security Section, Financial Department, Foreign Department, Central Cossack Office, Cultural Department, Academic Committee, and Red Cross. Some of these departments were not fully formed before the end of the war. The financial department succeeded in obtaining a loan from the German government on 18 January 1945.

<doc id="1133128" wikidata="Q712580" url="?curid=1133128" title="Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou">
<text>Geoffrey I of Anjou ( – 21 July 987), known as (&quot;Grey Gown&quot; or &quot;Greymantle&quot;), was count of Anjou from 960 to 987.

==Life==
Geoffrey was the eldest son of Fulk II, Count of Anjou and his first wife Gerberga. He succeeded his father as Count of Anjou about 960, at the age of 20. He married Adele of Meaux (934–982), daughter of Robert of Vermandois. Her father was a patrilineal descendant of Charlemagne, while her paternal grandmother was daughter of king Robert I of France. Through this marriage the Angevins joined the highest ranks of western French nobility.

Geoffrey started by making his power-base the citadel of Angers strategically placing his in key areas surrounding the city to protect his territories. The lands of the abbeys of Saint-Aubin and Saint-Serge in Angers provided the for his most faithful adherents. On this subject which became this family&#x27;s theme, Geoffrey advised both his sons, Fulk and Maurice: &quot;No house is weak that has many friends. Therefore I admonish you to hold dear those fideles who have been friends.&quot; Although one of the principal methods of Angevin expansion was by the creation of family connections Geoffrey exerted his control through various methods. His father had controlled Nantes through his second marriage to the widowed countess and Geoffrey continued this by making Count Guerech accept him as overlord. With an eye towards Maine, Geoffrey took advantage of the rift that developed between the Counts of Maine and the viscounts and Bishops of Le Mans. About 971 Geoffrey secured the see of Le Mans for his ally Bishop Seinfroy. In 973 Geoffrey had married his daughter Ermengarde-Gerberga to Conan I of Rennes but Conan began to oppose Geoffrey and in 982 the two met at the first battle of Conquereuil with Geoffrey defeating Conan.

Geoffrey had influence in Aquitaine by way of his mother Gerberga and then of his sister Adelaide-Blanche&#x27;s first marriage to the powerful baron Stephen, Count of Gevaudan and Forez, after whose death the lands were ruled by Adelaide. His nephews Pons and Bertrand succeeded as counts there and his niece Adalmode married Adelbert, Count of Marche and Périgord. In 975 Geoffrey had his brother Guy appointed Count and Bishop of Le Puy. In 982 Geoffrey married his now widowed sister Adelaide-Blanche to the fifteen-year-old Louis V of France, the two being crowned King and Queen of Aquitaine. But the marriage to a woman thirty years his senior failed as did Geoffrey&#x27;s plans to control Aquitaine through his young son-in-law. After the death of his first wife Adele, Geoffrey married secondly Adelaise de Châlon and for nearly a decade exerted control over the county of Châlons. Through the marriage of his son Fulk III to Elisabeth, the heiress of Vendôme, Geoffrey brought that county into the Angevin sphere of influence. At this time Geoffrey made Fulk his co-ruler, and died shortly thereafter while besieging the fortress of Marçon on 21 July 987.

==Family==
He married Adele of Meaux (934–982), daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy. Their children were:

* Ermengarde-Gerberga of Anjou (b. 956), married Conan I of Rennes. She married, secondly, William II of Angoulême.
* Fulk III of Anjou (970-1040), he succeeded his father as Count of Anjou.
* Geoffrey of Anjou (971-977), died young.

He married, secondly, to Adelaide de Chalon and had:

* Maurice of Anjou, destined to become a Count on the Nevers-Loire march, he failed and then assisted his brother in Angers.

<text>Dinamic Multimedia was a Spanish software house and publisher created in 1993 which was created after the bankruptcy of Dinamic Software in 1992 by some of its former members. After having released several titles, they filed for bankruptcy in September 2001.

== History ==
The &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; of the company was the PC Fútbol series, which featured an annual installment for a decade. Originally only featuring the Spanish leagues, later versions were developed for Italy (&quot;PC Calcio&quot;) and Argentina (&quot;PC Fútbol Apertura&quot; and &quot;Clausura&quot;). For the broader English market, &quot;EuroLeague Football&quot; was released in 2000, following a brief licensing of the &quot;Premier Manager&quot; franchise in the late 1990s. Dinamic also released other sports games, such as &quot;PC Basket&quot;, &quot;PC Atletismo&quot; or &quot;Eurotour Cycling&quot;, as well as adventure games such as &quot;Hollywood Monsters&quot;, one of the biggest projects in Spanish game development history. Most of the house titles and Spanish-produced games were marketed as budget titles and were fiercely championed by the local gaming press. In their late years, Dinamic expanded to Italy (in 1997) and distributed several titles in Spain, including high-profile titles such as &quot;Flying Corps Gold&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Sega Rally Championship 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;. One of the other games such as Toyland Racing has sold 35,000 copies in Spain.

In 1999, the Ruíz brothers and Carlos Abril left the company on disagreements with the main owner, and co-founded FX Interactive.

Dinamic fell into financial turmoil during the first half of 2001. The publisher&#x27;s ventures related to the dot-com bubble—such as the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;La Prisión&quot;—proved unsuccessful, and the company was caught in the global dot-com collapse. By early March, rumors had spread that Dinamic was in danger of closing. The company responded that only its online division was being shuttered, and traditional game projects such as &quot;&quot; were not in jeopardy, despite their delays. However, key faculty secretly departed Dinamic to join Pyro Studios during the period, and Dinamic entered receivership and cut 39 jobs in late March. Dinamic owed a significant debt of 1.5 billion pesetas to multiple creditors by this time. On 24 September, Dinamic announced its liquidation, following its financial upheaval earlier in the year. Although certain commentators had speculated that &quot;Runaway&quot;″s sales would save the publisher, it was ultimately Dinamic&#x27;s last published title.

Dinamic&#x27;s bankruptcy came as a major blow to the domestic game market: at the time, a writer for VNUNet reported the closure as &quot;bad news ... for the battered Spanish game software industry&quot;. In retrospect, David Navarro of &quot;MarcaPlayer&quot; called it &quot;probably the most traumatic event that the Spanish video game industry has experienced in history&quot;.

Dinamic Multimedia published the following games:

* &quot;Arctic Moves&quot;
* &quot;EuroTour Cycling&quot;

<text>Dinamic Software was a Spanish video game producer and publishing company. It was founded in 1984, and its activity ceased in 1992, comprising the Golden Era of Spanish Software. One year later, a part of its owners founded an independent company named Dinamic Multimedia. At the end of the 1980s, another company, Aventuras AD, who began to produce text adventures, was born from Dinamic Software.

== History ==
At the beginning of the 1980s, young brothers Pablo, Nacho and Victor Ruiz had their first contact with computers. In the case of Victor Ruiz, he started with a Sinclair ZX81, creating some amateur self-made games. On their first attempt as a company, they created NCM, which would later become Dinamic. Their original idea was simply to create a team of programmers, as they never thought that it would start such an intense commercial activity.

On their first months, they created themselves all the code, recorded themselves the programs on tape, designed and printed boxes and manuals, and distributed them, as well as designing their ads to publish them on newspapers and magazines. Their official debut was &quot;Yenght&quot;, a text adventure with graphics for ZX Spectrum, and &quot;Artist&quot;, a graphic design program, both released in 1984, but their first commercial success would come with the release of &quot;Saimazoom&quot;, later in 1984, which would start a trilogy, followed by &quot;Babaliba&quot; and &quot;Abu Simbel Profanation&quot;.

In 1986, Victor Ruiz would create &quot;Camelot Warriors&quot;, and the same year he would start the &quot;Moves&quot; trilogy, with &quot;Army Moves&quot; in 1986, followed by &quot;Navy Moves&quot; in 1988. In 1991, &quot;Arctic Moves&quot; was designed to be published for the Atari ST, but this version was not released due to Dinamic&#x27;s bankruptcy. The game would be redesigned for PC and published in 1995 by Dinamic Multimedia.

After &quot;Fernando Martin Basket Master&quot; became one of the most successful Spanish video games to date, they started a tradition to hire famous people, mainly sportsmen, to back their video games, something imitated by the rest of the Spanish companies at the time, and later by themselves, with the release of &quot;Aspar GP Master&quot; and &quot;Míchel Fútbol Master Super Skills&quot;.

1987 proved to be their most active year. They released one of the most commercially successful text adventures in Spain, &quot;Don Quijote&quot;, based on the cartoon series released at the time, both of which are based on the early 17th century novel by Miguel de Cervantes. With it they created the trademark &quot;Aventuras Dinamic&quot; which would be dedicated entirely on text adventures. However, text adventures, with or without graphics, eventually proved to be commercially unsuccessful in the Spanish market, and Aventuras Dinamic was bought by &quot;Andrés Samudio&quot;, so he could create &quot;Aventuras AD&quot;, on the condition that he would produce the games, but Dinamic had to distribute them, and so it was.

Other titles with massive Spanish and international distribution were &quot;Game Over&quot;, and &quot;Phantis&quot; (this one released in the United Kingdom as &quot;Game Over II&quot;). Their covers included girls with sexy corsets, which were heavily censored outside Spain. It is specially remembered in the case of &quot;Game Over&quot; where a nipple was visible, and was covered in the UK with the Dinamic logo, a screen capture or directly with a redrawn corset in subsequent editions. Other successful titles by Dinamic were &quot;Freddy Hardest&quot; (1987) and its sequel &quot;Freddy Hardest In South Manhattan&quot; (1989), &quot;Turbo Girl&quot; (1988), and &quot;After the War&quot; (1989).

During the Golden age of Spanish software, Dinamic distributed their own games in Spain, as well as the ones by Aventuras AD and other minor companies, becoming a rival to Erbe Software in this work, but with the change of decade and the migration to 16-bit platforms, sales of 8-bit computer games plummeted and after launching &quot;Narco Police&quot; (1991), Dinamic became unable to distribute their titles any longer. That year, Dinamic partnered with Imagine Software, a subsidiary of Ocean Software to distribute its titles outside of Spain, but the relationship was short-lived.

Their last title, &quot;Risky Woods&quot;, could be released, exclusively for 16-bit platforms, thanks to co-production with Zeus Software, and distribution by Electronic Arts, since Dinamic Software was already immersed in an economical crisis that would lead to their closedown in bankruptcy in 1992. One year later, the Ruiz brothers, with Carlos Abril (one of the designers of &quot;Phantis&quot;) and the owner of HobbyPress, José Ignacio Gómez-Centurión, would create a new company, which was named Dinamic Multimedia in honor of the defunct company, but would only be owned on a 30% by the Ruiz Brothers.

<doc id="1133151" wikidata="Q526815" url="?curid=1133151" title="Geoffrey II, Count of Anjou">
<text>Geoffrey II, called Martel (1006 – 14 November 1060), son of Fulk the Black, was a French knight and Count of Anjou from 1040 to 1060 and Count of Vendôme from 1032 to 1056. He fought battles against William VII, Duke of Aquitaine, Theobald III, Count of Blois, and William, Duke of Normandy. During his twenty-year reign Geoffrey II faced the ambitions of the Bishop of Le Mans, Gervais de Château-du-Loir, but was able to maintain his authority over the County of Maine. Martel founded the Abbey aux Dames in Saintonge and also -in collaboration with his wife Agnes- founded the Abbaye de la Trinité at Vendôme. The first mention of Geoffrey II in the &quot;Gesta Normannorum Ducum&quot; reads: &quot;Geoffrey, count of the Angevins, nicknamed Martel, a treacherous man in every respect, frequently inflicted assaults and intolerable pressure on his neighbors.&quot;

==Combat==

&quot;In alliance with King Henry I of France, Count Geoffrey laid siege to Tours in the winter of 1042–3. After the battle of Nouy on 21 August 1044 Theobald III, Count of Blois (1039–89) was taken prisoner by [Count Geoffrey], to whom he surrendered Tours with Chinon and Langeais, excluding, however, the monastery of Marmoutier.&quot; Henry and Geoffrey became estranged after this, and were not reconciled again until c. 1052, when their names appear together in a charter of August of that year. This is in conjunction with the rebellion of William of Talou against the duke of Normandy, and Count Geoffrey&#x27;s taking possession of the city of Mans (shortly after 26 March 1051).

Allied once again with King Henry, Count Geoffrey assaulted Normandy and seized the towns of Domfront and Alençon, evidently with the help of treachery within. Duke William laid siege to Domfront, which resisted his efforts to retake it throughout the winter of 1052. At this point Talou withdrew from the siege and started his rebellion. Duke William rapidly retook Alençon and then Domfront, driving Count Geoffrey back across the Norman border into Maine.

While Count Geoffrey was off balance, Duke William laid siege to Talou&#x27;s castle at Arques. King Henry failed to relieve Arques, and Talou&#x27;s rebellion had failed and he was exiled by late 1053. In late January, early February 1054, Count Geoffrey and King Henry together invaded Normandy and marched down the Seine toward Rouen. The King had divided his army and sent the other wing through eastern Normandy under the command of his brother Eudes, supported by Count Reginald of Clermont, Count Ralph of Montdidier, and Guy I, Count of Ponthieu. This army was defeated in a battle near Mortemer. Upon learning of this reverse, King Henry insisted upon retreating from Normandy, and Count Geoffrey accompanied him.

For the next several years, the war was centered in the County of Maine, with Duke William on the offensive. But King Henry in 1057, &quot;burning to avenge the insult inflicted on him by the duke, summoned Geoffrey, count of Anjou, to prepare a large army for another expedition into Normandy.&quot; (GND) This combined effort placed Duke William temporarily on the defensive. He retreated before the invaders as they moved deeper into Normandy. After penetrating to the Bessin, the Franco-Angevin army began to ford the River Dives near the estuary which is tidal. After the king and Count Geoffrey had crossed over, the remainder of their army got stuck on the opposite bank by the incoming tide. Duke William launched a sudden attack and defeated them. King Henry and Count Geoffrey withdrew again from Normandy and never returned. Count Geoffrey continued to offer resistance in Maine against the Norman expansion until his death on 14 November 1060.

==Family== 
An unusual entry in the cartulary of Ronceray describes a dispute over a vineyard seized by Geoffrey Martel and granted to his &quot;wives, or rather concubines&quot;, Agnes, Grécie, Adele, and Adelaide. Whether these women were his wives or concubines, each relationship can be described. 

Geoffrey II&#x27;s first wife was Agnes of Burgundy, the widow of William V, Duke of Aquitaine; she and Geoffrey married in 1032, but had divorced by 1050.

His second wife was Grécie of Langeais. Geoffrey II dismissed her to marry Adèle, the daughter of a &quot;Count Odo&quot;, perhaps Odo II, Count of Blois. He also divorced Adèle, and took Grécie back as his wife. His last wife was a German woman named Adelaide.

Despite these marital escapades, Geoffrey died childless.

==Succession== 
Since Geoffrey II had no living male children from either of two marriages, when he died the Anjou title went to his nephews, the two sons of his sister Ermengarde-Blanche (m. Geoffroy V of Château-Landon). Geoffroy III &quot;Le Barbu&quot; (the Bearded) was Count of Anjou from 1060 to 1068; Fulk IV Réchin (the Mouth) was count from 1068 to 1109. Fulk IV&#x27;s grandson, Geoffrey Plantagenet, married Matilda, heir to the English throne, and began the House of Plantagenet line of English kings.

==Beliefs== 
Geoffrey was well known for his adherence to the teachings of Berengar of Tours, ultimately playing a key role in securing his release from imprisonment later in life.This establishes Geoffrey as the first widely recognized Proto-Protestant knight.

<text>Digital Performer is a digital audio workstation and music sequencer software package published by Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU) of Cambridge, Massachusetts for the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms.

==Ancestry==
In 1984, Mark of the Unicorn released &quot;Professional Composer&quot;, one of the first application programs for the Apple Macintosh. The program used the Macintosh&#x27;s high-resolution graphics and printing to allow the user to print professional quality music scores.

In 1985, the company released a music sequencer named &quot;Performer&quot;, also based on the Macintosh platform, for arranging and performing with synthesizers and other devices which recognized the then-newly developed MIDI standard. Sending a series of numerical values, such a sequencer could direct many instruments, commanding which notes to play, at what loudness, and for how long to sustain them. There are many deep features in the MIDI protocol; MOTU developed extended capabilities in Digital Performer for handling these controllers and other actions (including remote operation of the software itself) through user-customizable graphical consoles, allowing the operator direct access to deeper features of instruments, stage lighting and various types of machines, all via MIDI interfaces and custom graphic buttons and sliders.

== Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) ==
In 1990, MOTU added the ability to synchronise audio (digital audio) to Performer and released it as &quot;&quot;Digital&quot; Performer,&quot; months after Opcode added this capability to Vision. Digital Performer was originally designed as a front-end to Digidesign&#x27;s Audiomedia hard disk recording system, which later became Pro Tools. Digital Performer&#x27;s specific appeal was its MIDI environment, which was fitted into the same transport system as the audio environment. This enabled users to record their MIDI instruments and mix the results with other live audio recorded in the studio (or vice versa). Personal computers of this time were too slow to handle high quality recording via their own CPU, so the addition of Digital signal processing co-processor cards was necessary to create a functioning audio recording studio. As the Mac&#x27;s CPU became powerful enough to record the digitized audio directly to hard disk, the DSP cards were gradually rendered unnecessary. Foreseeing this, MOTU created its own Motu Audio System (MAS) which helped Digital Performer to tap the Macintosh&#x27;s native power to record music directly to its own hard drive without the need for external co-processing and dedicated drives. By 2000, Digital Performer allowed users to record, mix, and master audio for commercial releases.

==Version history==
Version 3 of Digital Performer was the last to run on Mac OS 9, the Classic Macintosh operating system. After a complete rewrite, MOTU released Digital Performer 4.0 in May 2003, which ran exclusively on Mac OS X.

Beginning with version 4.5, MOTU introduced a number of important new features to Digital Performer. The two most important of these are built in pitch correction capability, and the professional Masterworks EQ plugin. Beginning with version 5.0, MOTU also introduced a set of virtual instruments. The software was updated to version 5.13 on 19 November 2007 to provide compatibility with Mac OS X v10.5. and available in Universal Binary.

Version 7.2 was introduced in 2010. Digital Performer remains one of the popular audio workstations on the Macintosh. Faster Apple CPUs continue to increase its capacity and performance. Chief among its competition on the Macintosh platform are Pro Tools and Apple&#x27;s Logic.

In October 2012, MOTU released Digital Performer 8 for OSX. Digital Performer 8 is available on Windows as well.

Version 9 of Digital Performer was released in June 2015 for Mac OS X and Windows. This version contains workflow enhancements, some new effect plugins, including emulations of the 1176 Peak Limiter and Craig Anderton&#x27;s MultiFuzz. MOTU also included a 64-bit version of its software synth (synthesizer) MX4 which used to be sold as a stand-alone product.

Version 10 of Digital Performer was released in February 2019 for Mac OS X and Windows. This version includes a new 5 GB instruments soundbank, a time/pitch audio stretching feature, and a real time loop triggering function.

==AudioDesk==
AudioDesk is a more basic version of MOTU&#x27;s Digital Performer for mac only. It is a multi-track recording, editing, and mixing application, with both offline file-based processing and realtime effects. Much of the graphical user interface (GUI) and its operation are similar to Digital Performer, although it lacks some of Digital Performer&#x27;s features. Most notably, it does not include MIDI sequencing capabilities, and thus does not include some of Digital Performer&#x27;s MIDI-specific editing windows. Also, AudioDesk is only available as a bundled application with MOTU audio interfaces; this also means that AudioDesk requires a MOTU audio interface to be used as its soundcard.

AudioDesk version 1 was first released in 1998, as bundled software with the MOTU 2408 PCI-based audio interface. Version 1 is compatible with the Classic Mac OS. Version 2 for Mac OS X was released in 2003, with numerous updates (many of which corresponded to updates from Digital Performer 3 for the Classic Mac OS to Digital Performer 4 for Mac OS X).

<doc id="1133158" wikidata="Q7416454" url="?curid=1133158" title="Sandon Half Tide Dock">
<text>Sandon Half Tide Dock is a half tide dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Kirkdale, connected to Huskisson Dock to the north, Wellington Dock to the east and Bramley-Moore Dock to the south. Sandon Dock was situated to the north of Wellington Dock and was accessible via Sandon Half Tide Dock.

==History==
Opened in 1851, the site was originally part of both Sandon Dock and Wellington Half Tide Dock, which connected directly to the Mersey via a narrow lock entrance. At the turn of the 20th century, Sandon Dock was redeveloped and an enlarged half tide dock created, with two larger locks built either side of the original entrance. After these access channels were sealed in March 1977, the water quality in the dock was noted to have improved.

Between 18 and 21 July 2008, larger vessels participating in the 2008 Tall Ships&#x27; Race were berthed here and at neighbouring Wellington Dock.

==Present==
The dock is the most southerly of Liverpool&#x27;s docks within Liverpool Freeport.

<text>Lawrence Bush (born 1951) is the author of several books of Jewish fiction and non-fiction, including &quot;Waiting for God: The Spiritual Explorations of a Reluctant Atheist&quot; and &quot;Bessie: A Novel of Love and Revolution&quot;.

He was born in New York City, attended Springfield Gardens High School, and holds a B.A. from City College of New York. In addition to writing and editing, he has worked as a puppeteer and school music teacher.

==&quot;Jewish Currents&quot;==
From 2002 to 2018 Bush edited &quot;Jewish Currents&quot;, an independent, progressive magazine founded in 1946 that during his tenure promoted Jewish identity as “a counterculture . . . in many ways antithetical to what drives our country today”. 
:“Throughout the conservative onslaught of the past three decades,” Bush has editorialized in Jewish Currents, “we have argued repeatedly that Jewish identification with the have-nots is more consistent with our people’s history, tradition, self-interest, and prospects for continuity, than the currying of favor with the powers-that-be — especially when those powers resemble nothing more than Pharaoh, the imperial oppressor of Biblical Egypt.”
He is also the editor of the daily blog &quot;JEWDAYO,&quot; discussing events from Jewish life and history on the anniversary of their occurrence. In 2011, the entries from the first year of the blog, 2010, were collected into a printed daybook &quot;Jewdayo&quot;.

==Other writings==
Bush is the former editor of &quot;Reconstructionism Today&quot;, the quarterly magazine of the Jewish Reconstructionist movement. He was co-editor of &quot;Jews.&quot;, an arts magazine and mail-art experience publIshed from 1999-2004. His writings have appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Tikkun&quot;, &quot;Moment&quot;, &quot;Reform Judaism&quot; and &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, among others. He provided updating and commentary for the millennial edition of Leo Rosten&#x27;s classic, &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot;.

Bush served for more than a decade as speechwriter for Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the late leader of Reform Judaism in America. Bush has described himself as &quot;an atheist who has nevertheless worked intimately in Jewish religious institutions as a writer and editor for much of my adult life.&quot;

:“There is a progressive pulse at the core of Jewish thought,” Bush has written. “It is this pulse — humanistic, engaged with the world, responsive to cultural evolution, dissatisfied with the status quo — that most keeps me engaged with Jewish identity and committed to its nurture. Notwithstanding contrary interpretations or even widespread indifference to the philosophical riches of Judaism, I’m drawn to the view of I.L. Peretz, who wrote that Jews who ‘wish to be true to ourselves’ should be asking ‘vital questions’ about ‘conscience, freedom, culture, ethics.’

In 2011, together with cartoonist Richard Codor, Bush created the humorous &quot;Babushkin&#x27;s Catalogue of Jewish Inventions&quot;

<text>Geoffrey III of Anjou (in French &quot;Geoffroy III d&#x27; Anjou&quot;) (c. 1040–1096), called &quot;le Barbu&quot; (&quot;the Bearded&quot;), was the Count of Anjou 1060–68.

==Early life==
Geoffrey, born , was the eldest son of Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais and Ermengarde of Anjou, the daughter of Fulk III of Anjou. Both he and his younger brother Fulk, called &quot;le Réchin&quot;, were taken under the wing of their uncle, Geoffrey Martel and both were knighted by him in 1060. Although well treated by his uncle, it is thought that Geoffrey Martel preferred his younger nephew, Fulk, but nonetheless left the countship to Geoffrey. Geoffrey III would serve as Count of Anjou until the Countship was taken from him by his brother, Fulk.

==Military career==
He succeeded his uncle Geoffrey Martel in 1060, but it shortly became clear to his vassals he was not nearly as competent as his uncle had been. He had given his younger brother Fulk Saintonge as an appanage but in 1062, when it was attacked by Count Guy-Geoffrey of Poitou (aka William VIII), Geoffrey failed to come to Fulk&#x27;s support and Saintonge was lost. In 1063 the county of Maine was lost to Anjou as well. In 1064 Geoffrey failed to come to the aid of one of his vassals, Rainaldus of Chateau-Gontier, who was captured by the Bretons. In 1065 Geoffrey alienated Archbishop Barthelemy by trying to force his own choice for Bishop of Le Mans on the church. In turn the archbishop excommunicated Geoffrey. 

As the situation in Anjou deteriorated Fulk IV quarreled with his brother Geoffrey. In 1067 Fulk rebelled and took the county from Geoffrey, briefly imprisoning him. In 1068 Geoffrey attacked Fulk, and once again was defeated. This time Geoffrey was imprisoned where he remained for 28 years. He was finally freed by the intervention of Pope Urban II in 1096, but died soon after.

==Family==
He married Julienne de Langeais before 1060. She died after 7 August 1067. They had no issue. 

Geoffrey and Fulk&#x27;s sister, Hildegarde married Joscelin I, Lord of Courtenay and had issue.

<doc id="1133179" wikidata="Q739482" url="?curid=1133179" title="Geoffrey IV, Count of Anjou">
<text>Geoffrey IV (1070/75 – 19 May 1106), called Martel (the Hammer), was Count of Anjou from 1103 until his early death, either co-ruling with his father, Fulk IV, or in opposition to him. He was popular with the Church and grew a reputation for curbing tyranny and opposing his violent father, who, according to Orderic Vitalis, enjoyed pillaging and terrorising his subjects.

Geoffrey was a son of Fulk&#x27;s second wife, Ermengard of Bourbon. His father tried to disinherit him in favour of Fulk the Younger, his son by his fourth wife, Bertrada of Montfort. Fulk, by then an old man, had previously delegated much of his authority to Geoffrey. With the support of his father&#x27;s adversaries, Geoffrey seems to have achieved recognition from his father and from 1103 styled himself &quot;count&quot; (&quot;comes&quot; in the Latin of the day) and took control of the government. He allied with Renaud de Martigné, Bishop of Angers, against the baron Maurice of Craon. An anonymous poem by a scholar or cleric addressed to a certain Philip, probably Philip of Melun, son of Philip I of France through his dalliance with Bertrada, is an encomium of a &quot;Count Martel&quot; (&quot;Martellus consul&quot;), probably Geoffrey IV. The poem is didactic and upholds the count, only named as Martel, as an exemplar of good rulership. The last lines offer hope that he may &quot;long prosper&quot;, and so must have been written during the brief period of his rule in Anjou.

Geoffrey was besieging a rebellious baron in the castle of Candé when, on 19 May 1106, he was struck and killed by an arrow while going to negotiations. The &quot;Chronica de gestis consulum Andegavorum&quot; attributed this assassination to Fulk and Bertrada, and praised the late count as &quot;an admirable man, distinguished in justice, a cultivator or the whole of goodness, who was a terror to all his enemies.&quot; The &quot;Annales Vindocinenses&quot; call him &quot;a subduer and conqueror of tyrants [perhaps his father], protector and defender of churches.&quot;

The line-up of the band was drastically changed from their previous albums. It was the first album without founding member Craig Fuller, who was the primary songwriter, and vocalist, on their two previous LP&#x27;s.
In addition to the usual 2-channel stereo version the album was also released by RCA Records in a 4-channel quadraphonic sound version in 1975.

The album was reissued in 2017 on hybrid Super Audio CD by Dutton Vocalion. This edition was remastered from the original master tapes and contains both the original stereo and quadraphonic mixes. The disc is a 2 on 1 release, also containing the band&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;If The Shoe Fits&quot;.

<text>Adam Frederick Helmer ( 1754 – April 9, 1830), also known as John Adam Frederick Helmer and Hans Adam Friedrich Helmer, was an American Revolutionary War soldier among those of the Mohawk Valley and surrounding regions of New York State. He was made nationally famous by Walter D. Edmonds&#x27; popular 1936 novel &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; with its depiction of &quot;Adam Helmer&#x27;s Run&quot; of September 16, 1778, to warn the people of German Flatts of the approach of Joseph Brant and his company of Indians and Tories.

==Background==
Adam Helmer was born in German Flatts, New York, to Maria Barbara Kast, and George Friedrich Helmer, who was born on June 9, 1706, in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse a city in the Rhineland-Palatinate region in southwestern Germany. G.F. Helmer emigrated to America sometime before 1710 and eventually settled in one of the numerous Palatine farming communities on the south side of the Mohawk River in central New York.

As late as 1774, this Palatine district and others in the area widely supported British control, but with the death of the powerful loyalist Mohawk Valley landowner Sir William Johnson and news of the Declaration of Rights by the Continental Congress, anti-British sentiments began to surface and a Tryon County Committee of Safety was organized. This and the news of Continental Army resistance at the Battle of Lexington and Concord encouraged the remaining Johnson family and other loyalists to fortify their properties and to recruit Iroquois to side with the British. This in turn prompted the colonists in 1775 to organize a militia under the command of Colonel Nicholas Herkimer. Early the next year, Herkimer aided General Philip Schuyler who was sent by Congress to disarm the Loyalists. Many of the loyalists and sympathizing Iroquois led by William Johnson&#x27;s son Sir John Johnson escaped to Canada where they began to organize to take back their Mohawk Valley holdings.

During the summer of 1776 Colonel Herkimer allowed his regular militia to return to their farms; however, about one out of every fifteen soldiers, including Lieutenant Adam Helmer, was assigned to ranger duty. Helmer was assigned as a scout in Captain John Breadbake&#x27;s company.

==Battle of Oriskany==
In the summer of 1777, Herkimer, by then a brigadier general in the provincial militia, was warned by friendly Oneidas of the impending siege of Fort Stanwix (known to the Americans as Fort Schuyler) by British Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger. General Herkimer ordered Tryon County militia to assemble at Fort Dayton to go to the aid of Colonel Peter Gansevoort at Fort Stanwix. G.F. Helmer and Adam Helmer&#x27;s brother Johan Fredrich Helmer, as part of the Tryon County militia were called up. Herkimer sent three scouts, Captain Hans Mark Demuth, Hans Yost Folts, and Lieutenant Adam Helmer to Fort Stanwix to relay the news to Colonel Gansevoort. Pressured by his subordinate commanders on August 6, General Herkimer reluctantly and prematurely set out to attack St. Leger&#x27;s army. While passing through a ravine, they were ambushed by British regulars, Tories, and Indians under the command of Joseph Brant and John Butler, thus starting what would become known as the Battle of Oriskany, Adam Helmer lost his brother, Capt. Johann Friedrich Helmer, in the battle and another, Lt. George Frederick Helmer II, was seriously wounded.

Helmer, the fittest of the three scouts, reached Fort Stanwix with the message ahead of the other two, having traversed swampy terrain and floated down river when a severe storm flooded his route. News of the Oriskany battle arrived shortly after Helmer&#x27;s did, and Ganesvoort ordered an attack on the British encampments. Some combination of the weather and Gansevoort&#x27;s attack contributed to the retreat of the British from the Oriskany battlefield back to their camps surrounding the fort. In any case, Herkimer&#x27;s troops were able to escape to await reinforcements. Herkimer himself was wounded in the fight, returned to his home and died soon after. Gansevoort refused to submit to the siege, and the British withdrew from the area with the news that Benedict Arnold had arrived at Fort Dayton with reinforcements.

==Adam Helmer&#x27;s run==
In September 1778, Lt. Helmer and eight scouts under his command were sent to the Unadilla River Valley to spy on Joseph Brant&#x27;s company of Indians and Tories who were encamped at Unadilla near the confluence of the Unadilla and Susquehanna Rivers. It was feared that Brant would send a raiding party north to the Mohawk Valley during the harvest season to forcefully obtain stores for the winter ahead. When Helmer&#x27;s scouts reached Edmeston Manor, the farm of Percifer Carr, just north of what is now South Edmeston, they were attacked by a large group of Brant&#x27;s men, apparently part of the feared raiding party on its way north. Several of the scouts were killed, but Helmer managed to escape.

Helmer took off running to the north-east, through the hills, toward Schuyler Lake and then north to Andrustown (near present-day Jordanville, New York) where he warned his sister&#x27;s family of the impending raid and obtained fresh footwear. He also warned settlers at Columbia and Petrie&#x27;s Corners, most of whom then fled to safety at Fort Dayton. When Helmer arrived at the fort, severely torn up from his run, he told Colonel Peter Bellinger, the commander of the fort, that he had counted at least 200 of the attackers en route to the valley. (see Attack on German Flatts (1778)). The straight-line distance from Carr&#x27;s farm to Fort Dayton is about thirty miles, and Helmer&#x27;s winding and hilly route was far from straight. It was said that Helmer then slept for 36 hours straight. During his sleep, on September 17, 1778, the farms of the area were destroyed by Brant&#x27;s raid. The total loss of property in the raid was reported as: 63 houses, 59 barns, full of grain, 3 grist mills, 235 horses, 229 horned cattle, 279 sheep, and 93 oxen. Only two men were reported killed in the attack, one by refusing to leave his home when warned.

Three days later Helmer led another group of militia back to the Carr farm on the Unadilla, discovered the bodies of three of his scouts, and buried them at that site. The fate of the other five scouts is not known.

Helmer also served in the New York State Levies under Colonel Lewis DuBois.

==Personal==
Helmer married Anna Bellinger (1757–1841) and sired ten children: Frederick (1777), Margaret (1778), Anna (1781), Adam (1783), Peter (1786), Elizabeth (1788), Catharine (1790), David (179?), Maria Barbara (1795), and Eve (1800).

Adam Helmer died on April 9, 1830, in the town of Brutus in Cayuga County, New York.

==Helmer in novel and film==
Adam Helmer was an important but fictionalized character in Edmonds&#x27; novel, &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;. Although Helmer&#x27;s military actions were generally portrayed with accuracy, including his famous run, Edmonds&#x27; description of his person varies from historic description. The book pictures Helmer as a large, unschooled, bachelor womanizer with long blonde hair, while historic descriptions indicate he was a lean , married farmer, seeming to have more in common with the book&#x27;s main character, Gil Martin.

In John Ford&#x27;s 1939 film adaptation of the novel, Helmer is portrayed by Ward Bond as &quot;Adam Hartman&quot;. Helmer&#x27;s run was omitted from the film and replaced with a run by Gil to get reinforcements from the nearest fort. The run is the heroic highpoint of the film.

<doc id="1133209" wikidata="Q7823691" url="?curid=1133209" title="Tony Wong (Canadian politician)">
<text>Tony Wong (born Wong Chi-wah; December 12, 1948 – June 17, 2009) was a Hong Kong Canadian
politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2006 representing the Greater Toronto Area riding of Markham. He was a municipal councillor for the city of Markham from 1997 to 2004 and served as a York Region Councillor from 2006 to 2009.

==Background==
Wong was born in Hong Kong and he studied at the Diocesan Boys&#x27; School. He received a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in math from the University of Toronto and Master&#x27;s in computer science from the University of Missouri. He was a lawyer (University of Toronto) and founding director of the Metropolitan Toronto Southeast Asian Legal Clinic. He was a partner in his own practice, Wong and Chun. He served as a board member of the Markham Stouffville Hospital Foundation, the St. John&#x27;s Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation and the York Region Police Services Board. He is cousin of Toronto City Councillor Cynthia Lai.

==Politics==
In 1997 Wong, ran for the municipal council in Markham, Ontario. He received 1,406 votes defeating his nearest rival by 774 votes. In the 2000 election, he was elected as one of four regional councillors. He was a leading figure in calling for reconciliation between the city&#x27;s Chinese and Muslim communities in 1999, after a controversy concerning the construction of a local mosque. In 2003, he spoke against an attempt by the government of China to enact &quot;anti-subversion&quot; legislation in Hong Kong (many recent Chinese immigrants in Markham have dual Canadian/Hong Kong citizenship).

In the 2003 provincial election, he contested Markham for the Liberal Party against David Tsubouchi, a prominent cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. Markham had been represented by the Progressive Conservative Party since its creation in 1987, and it was anticipated that Tsubouchi would be re-elected despite a strong provincial swing to the Liberals; instead, Wong defeated him by 5,996 votes. Wong acknowledged that his candidacy benefited from a large ethnic Chinese immigrant population in the riding.

The Liberals won the provincial election, and Wong was subsequently named parliamentary assistant to Joseph Cordiano, the Minister of Economic Development and Trade.

Not long after his election, Wong held a benefit dinner for the daughters of Geng Chaohui, a recent Chinese immigrant to Canada who committed suicide because of underemployment. The event raised $30,000, although it was little reported outside of the Chinese-language press.

On September 25, 2006, Wong resigned his seat in the legislature to run for York Regional Council. He won one of four seats in November 2006. He served in council until March 2009 and took a leave of absence. Wong was expected to return to council in September.

Wong died of liver failure on June 17, 2009, at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. He is survived by his wife Ellee and his daughter Daphne.

<doc id="1133212" wikidata="Q2454596" url="?curid=1133212" title="Praia (Santa Cruz da Graciosa)">
<text>Praia (officially São Mateus) is a Portuguese civil parish in the municipality of Santa Cruz da Graciosa, on the island of Graciosa, in the Azores. It still retains its former name &quot;Praia&quot; locally, owing to the parish having once been the historical municipality of Praia. The population in 2011 was 836, in an area of 12.82 km².

==History==
São Mateus was one of the first Captaincies of the Azores, and administered by its Captain-Donatorio, Duarte Barreto.

The main centre and parish seat obtained the category, and elevated to the title, of &quot;vila&quot; (or town) during the reign of King John III, by royal charter on 1 April 1546. It operated as the municipal seat until 1867, when its role was superseded by the much larger Santa Cruz da Graciosa. Yet, it still retained the honorific title of &quot;vila&quot;. During this time, the settlers of the island formed historical, social and economic contacts with the peoples and economy of Terceira, in addition to those ships travelling between Europe and Brazil.

In the 16th century it had become a rich parish, and competed with Santa Cruz. In 1890, there were over 1783 inhabitants, but it had already begun a slow decline. Part of the population emigrated to the United States or Canada, while the remaining population relied primarily on a subsistence lifestyle for local consumption.

==Geography==
Within an area of less than 13 kilometres square, the parish includes various individual rural localities, including Vila da Praia, Fenais, Fonte do Mato, Lagoa, Pedras Brancas and Feteira.

The parish occupies the extreme southeast, along a long valley which separates the Caldeira massif from the rest of the island. To the interior the volcanic crater, simply the &quot;Calderia&quot; (caldera), is the largest volcanic structure on the island. Within its crater, is the &quot;Furna do Enxofre&quot;, a large cavern and subterranean lake bio-system popular with tourists. Located directly opposite the village is the Praia Islet, an important natural reserve, classified as a &quot;Zone of Special Protection&quot;, due to the abundant marine bird species that use it for nesting and as transitory stop in annual migrations.

The population is aging in this community, and is shifting into a bedroom community of the much larger Santa Cruz.

==Economy==
In addition to agriculture, a staple of the fertile lands of the Azores, Praia has been known for being an important fishing community and supplier for the economy of Graciosa. In addition to fish, fisherman have collected and dried algae (&quot;Sargassum&quot;) as fertilizer. Similarly, Graciosense were producers of tile, for the regional market, resulting in periods of boom.

Other complementary activities, in addition to the small garages and mechanical shops, the parish is a center of civil construction and bread makers, and has an outpost of the fiscal auditors, customs, post office and bank.

<text>Melissa Marie Mathison (June 3, 1950 – November 4, 2015) was an American film and television screenwriter and an activist for the Tibetan independence movement. She was best known for writing the screenplays for the films &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979) and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), the latter of which earned her the Saturn Award for Best Writing and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

Mathison later wrote &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; (1995), based on Lynne Reid Banks&#x27;s 1980 children&#x27;s novel of the same name, and &quot;Kundun&quot; (1997), a biographical-drama film about the Dalai Lama. Her final film credit was &quot;The BFG&quot; (2016), which marked her third collaboration with film director Steven Spielberg.

==Early years==
Mathison was born on June 3, 1950, in Los Angeles, one of five siblings. Her father, Richard Randolph Mathison, was the Los Angeles bureau chief of &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Her mother was Margaret Jean (née Kieffer) Mathison, a food writer and convenience-foods entrepreneur. After graduating from Providence High School in 1968, Mathison attended the University of California, Berkeley. Her family was friendly with Francis Ford Coppola, whose children were babysat by Mathison. Coppola offered her a job as his assistant on &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), an opportunity for which she left her studies at UC Berkeley.

With Coppola&#x27;s encouragement, she wrote a script for &quot;The Black Stallion&quot;, adapted from the novel, that caught Steven Spielberg&#x27;s attention.

==Screenwriting and production credits==
Mathison wrote the screenplay for &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) in collaboration with Steven Spielberg. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The script was based on a story, written by John Sayles, that Spielberg provided to Mathison during the filming of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). Spielberg attributes the line &quot;E.T. phone home&quot; to Mathison. She collaborated again with Spielberg for &quot;The BFG&quot; (2016), her final film, which was dedicated in her memory. She also had film credits for &quot;The Escape Artist&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; (1995).

==Dalai Lama==
Mathison met the Dalai Lama in 1990 when she was writing the script for &quot;Kundun&quot; (1997) and developed a lasting friendship with him. She continued to work as an activist for Tibetan freedom and was on the board of the International Campaign for Tibet.

==Personal life and death==
Mathison had an extramarital relationship with Francis Ford Coppola while working as his assistant on &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, an affair that lasted through the production of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. From 1983 to 2004, she was married to Harrison Ford; the couple had two children. She died on November 4, 2015, in Los Angeles, aged 65, from neuroendocrine cancer.

<doc id="1133222" wikidata="Q851292" url="?curid=1133222" title="Praia Grande">
<text>Praia Grande is a municipality in the Baixada Santista Metropolitan Region, on the southern coast of the Brazilian state of São Paulo. It is part of the Immediate Region of Santos and its population measured in the IBGE census review in 2010 was 262,051 inhabitants. In the 2022 IBGE census, the population of Praia Grande was 349,935 inhabitants, being the city in Baixada Santista that grew the most in the period 2010–2022. It is the second most populous city on the coast of São Paulo, after only Santos. With an area of 149.652 km², the population density in 2022 was 2,338.32 inhabitants/km². The municipality is formed by the headquarters and the district of Solemar.

==History==
Although the political emancipation is recent, the area covered today by the municipality of Praia Grande was one of the first areas colonized by the Portuguese, which began with the arrival of Martim Afonso in 1532. The first village founded by the explorer, sent by the Portuguese crown, was that of St. Vincent, which remained part Praia Grande until 18 January 1967.

After its emancipation on 19 January 1967, the city slightly accelerated the pace of growth experienced since the 1950s, earning a higher quality in their public services, given the proximity of the municipal government with the reality of the local population. In the 1980s, the city gained new impetus to its growth with the opening of the Small Sea Bridge - Deputy Esmeraldo Soares Tarquínio de Campos Filho Bridge (in the final stretch of the Rodovia dos Imigrantes), linking the island of São Vicente in the city, and solving two problems at once: as well as relieve traffic on saturated Suspension Bridge, the city gained a direct link to the capital without the need of going through the cities of Santos and São Vicente, in order to access the Via Anchieta, then the only option to reach the capital. Thus, Praia Grande became the resort closest to the capital.

However, this ease of access has brought great inconvenience, that they would be solved by 1993 when the city started a revolution: the transport system has been completely refurbished, more than 90% of the streets were paved, the sewage began an expansion of collection (which began with 60% of households by 2012 and reach 100%), being treated and thrown more than 3 km from the coast, the edge of the beach and the main tourist spots were completely re-urbanized, it was forbidden to input bus tours without prior authorization from the municipality, the road system has been completely revised and reconfigured on interventions that occurred until 2006.

Some projects are still to be deployed in the city, regardless of the administration, such as airport charges in the region of Andaraguá, State college campuses (UNESP) and Federal (UNIFESP), the transformation of municipal landfill in ecological park (awaiting decontamination of the soil) and Route 700, linking the Anhanguera to the Rodovia dos Imigrantes.

==Demographics==
===Population history===
Until the early 1990s, most residents lived near the Praia Grande beach, mainly concentrated in the region between the beach of Boqueirão, where is located the city center and beach Ocian. However, from the mid-1990s, the construction boom, which occurred through a series of infrastructure works, landscaping and urbanization, which until then were too poor, eventually attracting thousands of families in the municipality, search of jobs with contractors and builders, causing a huge swelling population in the region between the current South Expressway, the Rodovia Padre Manoel da Nóbrega and the Serra do Mar creating suburbs, as Quiet Garden, Ribeiropolis, Garden Fern, among others, but now, since all are in the process of urbanization with schools, kindergartens, public transport and flooring in most of its streets, as well as future investments made by the city size at these sites, such as 16 million dollars to be invested in the suburb Glory, in its complete redevelopment.

==Bathing Resort==
Praia Grande is one of 15 cities considered spas by São Paulo state, which complied with certain prerequisites set by State Law. There are other cities that are not spas, they are still tourist resorts. This status ensures these municipalities a larger budget from the state through the Department of Field Support Offices of the State of São Paulo for the promotion of regional tourism. Also, the municipality acquires the right to add your name next to the title of &quot;Bathing Resort&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Estância Balneária&quot;), term by which is designated by both the municipal official or expedient for the reference state.

==Neighborhoods==
Praia Grande is divided into three districts: the Main/Seat District, Samaná, in the highlands, and Solemar, near the border with Mongaguá.

The neighborhoods can be classified between coastal ones, which are located between the Padre Manoel da Nóbrega Highway and the beach, peripheral, located on the residential area between the highway and the Piaçabuçu river and its foothills, and the mountainous region of Samaná. Since 1992, each neighborhood has been identified with a different color, inserted in all public IDs for each district.

Also, some neighborhoods are subdivided into smaller regions called Administrative Squares, which once made more specific addresses, helping the service of the local post office, currently serving to group places that have features common to the municipal administration work in some specific need.

The municipality contains part of the Xixová-Japuí State Park, created in 1993.

==Infoway==
Praia Grande was the first Brazilian city to install the Information Highway, a fiber optic interconnection of all municipal government offices, which resulted in more than 300 km of cables installed in the main streets and avenues. With this network was also possible to install more than 1,200 video cameras along the busiest places of the city as well as in public buildings and monuments. The entire city is monitored by these cameras, a central, directly interconnected with the Municipal Guard and the Military Police. Thus, rates of police incidents fell 60% and vandalism of public facilities in the city by 40%.

Today, Praia Grande is the city with the largest number of surveillance cameras in the Americas, and the second in the world, second only to London, United Kingdom. There is a program of installation, the next two years (from 2007), 900 more cameras, overtaking even London in the amount of cameras installed.

In addition to monitoring, the Infoway allows data access to any unit of municipal institutions, in real time. This facilitates, for example, medical care, because even before the patient hold the first consultation, the doctor will have access to the entire history of every patient in the care of the municipal health network, including by which medical specialties which there have been consultations, tests, prescription drugs, allergies, and everything else that is part of history.

==Media==
In telecommunications, the city was served by the Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Music is the debut studio album by American rock band 311. It was released on February 9, 1993. &quot;Do You Right&quot; was released as a single. The album was certified gold in 1999 by the RIAA, having sold over 500,000 copies.

==Background==
There are only five tracks that were not included on 311&#x27;s previous independent releases; &quot;Visit&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot;, &quot;Hydroponic&quot;, &quot;My Stoney Baby&quot;, and &quot;Fat Chance&quot;. However, all of the songs that had been previously released were altered, most notably &quot;Do You Right&quot;, where nearly all of the lyrics were changed. SA also changed his main verses in &quot;Freak Out&quot;, &quot;Feels So Good&quot; and &quot;Fuck The Bullshit&quot;. The breakdown in &quot;Plain&quot; was completely changed musically, and the lyrics were re-arranged. The first pressing was originally manufactured and distributed by &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot; and thus bears the &quot;WB&quot; logo in the bottom right corner. Later issues were manufactured and distributed by &quot;RED&quot; in 1994, &quot;Mercury Records&quot; in 1996 and most recently &quot;Volcano&quot;. The song &quot;My Stoney Baby&quot; has been featured in the 2008 film &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay&quot;.

<text>Dietwil is a municipality in the district of Muri in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.
==History==
Dietwil is first mentioned in 1236 as &quot;Tuetwile&quot;. To distinguish it from the municipality of Grossdietwil in Lucerne it was also called &quot;Kleindietwil&quot; or &quot;Dietwil im Reusstal&quot;.

At the beginning of the 15th century, the Lucerne von Moos family acquired the right to low justice in the village, which they relinquished in 1422 to Lucerne. After the conquest of the Aargau in 1415, the village came under the authority of the city of Lucerne and was part of the Meienberg district. In 1798 Dietwil&#x27;s ties to Lucerne were severed. With the Act of Mediation in 1803, it became part of the newly created Canton of Aargau. In 1863 a decision of the Cantonal Council of Aargau naturalized all the gypsies who had settled in Dietwil after fleeing Napoleon&#x27;s armies in Belarus.

In 1145 the Catholic parish church of St. James the elder was dedicated. It was replaced in 1780 by the current rococo aisleless church. Between 1370 and 1806, the Knights of Malta house at Hohenrain possessed the right of patronage.

The municipality has a little regional agricultural trade. The ferries from Eien and Gumpelsfahr connect Dietwil with Zug. The nearby on-ramp to the A14 Motorway, which runs from Zug to Lucerne, has led to growth in Dietwil. In 2000 about a third of the workers in Dietwil worked in agriculture and slightly more than half in the services sector.

==Geography==

Dietwil has an area, , of . Of this area, or 72.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 17.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 8.9% is settled (buildings or roads), or 1.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.2% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 5.3% and transportation infrastructure made up 2.7%. Out of the forested land, 15.5% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.6% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 45.3% is used for growing crops and 24.9% is pastures, while 2.4% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is in rivers and streams.

The municipality is located in the Muri district, on the Reuss river. It consists of the &quot;haufendorf&quot; village (an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square) of Dietwil and the hamlets of Eien and Gumpelsfahr. Bordered on two sides by the cantons of Zug and Lucerne, it is the southernmost village of that canton.

<doc id="1133265" wikidata="Q1285244" url="?curid=1133265" title="Youth Group">
<text>Youth Group is an Australian rock band based in Newtown, New South Wales. Built around the vocals of singer Toby Martin and production of Wayne Connolly, the sound of Youth Group is reminiscent of indie rock artists such as Teenage Fanclub, Pavement and Death Cab for Cutie.

The band formed in Sydney in the late 1990s and has released four albums, three of which have gained worldwide release. They achieved major success in 2006 when their cover of Alphaville&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young&quot;, which had been recorded for the soundtrack of the US TV drama &quot;The O.C.&quot;, was released as a single and reached No. 1 in Australia, attaining platinum status.

As of 2015, the band is signed to Ivy League Records.

==History ==
The band&#x27;s founding members were Toby Martin on rhythm guitar and vocals, Danny Lee Allen on drums, Andy Cassell on bass guitar, and Paul Murphy on lead guitar. The band&#x27;s first show was in November 1997 at the Warren View Hotel in the inner Sydney suburb of Enmore. At this stage, Allen had played drums for approximately two months. Current lead guitarist, Cameron Emerson-Elliott, and bassist, Patrick Matthews, joined in 2004. Martin, the main songwriter, is the grandson of Hungarian-born Australian poet, David Martin. Founding bass player Cassell retired from bass duties in 2003 to concentrate on being one of three partners in the Ivy League Records label and the Winterman &amp; Goldstein band management agency (Youth Group&#x27;s Australian record label and management, respectively). Cassell is a relative of Australian Test cricketer Geoff Dymock. Founding guitarist Paul Murphy left the band in 2003 due to creative differences. Cameron Emerson-Elliott played guitar with Sydney punk band John Reed Club in the late 1990s and has known Martin since their school days in Canberra, Australia, at Narrabundah College; at the college, the pair wrote songs together as The Morris Brothers. Patrick Matthews played bass in The Vines before joining Youth Group. Johnno Lattin (also of La Huva) played bass in the band during the &quot;Skeleton Jar&quot; period around 2003. 
The band met success when a series of chance happenings led Epitaph Records boss Brett Gurewitz to hear their second album, &quot;Skeleton Jar&quot; in 2004 and release it in the US in 2005. Despite sounding nothing like the California punk that Epitaph is widely known for, the support of a US label was the crucial break that Youth Group needed to find a wider audience. In 2003 the band played at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas and performed on four dates with The Vines and The Music on a US West Coast tour. But it was a chance to support Death Cab for Cutie in 2005 on a coast to coast US tour that saw their profile rise most quickly internationally.

Their single &quot;Forever Young&quot;, a cover of the 1984 song by Alphaville, was used in the television show &quot;The O.C.&quot; and heavily featured in promos for Australian TV station Channel Ten at the beginning of 2006. The song debuted on the Australian charts at No. 2 in March 2006, and eventually peaked at No. 1. It was also No. 1 in the first ever digital download chart. During 2006, they supported Coldplay in their sold-out tour of Australia; in 2008 they supported Kings of Leon and Interpol on their tours of Australia.

Youth Group won the ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist - Single for &quot;Forever Young&quot;.

Youth Group toured the US twice in 2009 before moving into an extended break. Though the band remained on good terms, they began focusing on other projects. Martin released a solo album, &quot;Love&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, in July 2012 on Ivy League Records, while Danny relocated to New York, toured with We Are Scientists and with Brooklyn band, The Drums until 2017. Matthews played in several bands - including Betty Airs and The Jewel &amp; The Falcon - before joining Community Radio alongside fellow Youth Group bandmate Emerson-Elliot. In 2011, &quot;Skeleton Jar&quot; made No. 98 on Australian radio station Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time (Industry List).

In November 2014, the band announced a show at the Newtown Social Club in Sydney for January 2015, in which they played &quot;Skeleton Jar&quot; in its entirety. The show sold out within a week of going on sale. The band later announced additional headlining shows in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane for June and July 2015; as well as a vinyl release of &quot;Skeleton Jar&quot;. The band returned again in late 2016, with their album &quot;Australian Halloween&quot; being released in October 2019.

<doc id="1133285" wikidata="Q1951028" url="?curid=1133285" title="Transistor (311 album)">
<text>Transistor is the fourth studio album by American rock band 311, released on August 5, 1997, by Capricorn Records. The album saw a change in musical style as fewer songs feature rapping in comparison to the band&#x27;s previous albums. Intended as a double album, 311 opted to release the album on a single CD in order to make it more affordable to their fans.

Upon its release, &quot;Transistor&quot; received largely mixed reviews from critics, who felt it was overlong and self-indulgent. Retrospectively, however, the album has been more positively received, and was certified platinum by the RIAA.

==Music==
Clocking in at 67:59 and with twenty-one tracks (or twenty-three, counting both hidden tracks), &quot;Transistor&quot; is 311&#x27;s longest album and, until their 2017 album &quot;Mosaic&quot;, was their only album to contain more than sixteen tracks. &quot;Transistor&quot; was originally intended to be a double album, but all songs were instead placed onto one disc. In a 1997 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, drummer Chad Sexton said that the band had recorded 29 songs for the album, but decided to cut the album&#x27;s songs down to 21 to fit on a single CD instead of two (the vinyl release still featured two LPs) in order to make the release affordable to their fans. As 311 were only contracted for 11 songs, meaning they would not be paid for including any more songs, the band effectively gave away 10 of the album&#x27;s songs for free. Nick Hexum admitted that doing too many songs in not enough time for &quot;Transistor&quot; was a mistake.

While still utilizing their alternative rock sound in many songs, &quot;Transistor&quot; saw 311 moving away from their hip hop-influenced sound of their previous albums for more of a reggae-influenced sound, as shown in songs such as &quot;Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Inner Light Spectrum&quot;, &quot;Running&quot;, &quot;Rub a Dub&quot;, and &quot;Stealing Happy Hours&quot;. Although, their rap rock style is still present in some songs, such as &quot;Galaxy&quot;, &quot;No Control&quot;, &quot;Tune In&quot;, &quot;Starshines&quot;, and &quot;Borders&quot;. Transistor also contains elements of dub, space rock and stoner rock.

==Reception==

&quot;Transistor&quot; received a mixed review from Allmusic, who commented that &quot;a project of this magnitude is almost doomed to fall on its face, and &quot;Transistor&quot; nearly does,&quot; and noted there were enough good songs for a 30 to 40 minute album, but had too much filler. They nominated the title track as the only Track Pick from the album. The album has received criticism from The A.V. Club, who says &quot;With 21 songs spread out over 68 minutes, the record has taken plenty of critical punishment for its excessive length alone,&quot; and calls it a &quot;joyless, tedious exercise in white-boy reggae, white-boy rap, white-boy dub and white-boy rock,&quot; concluding that the band could suffer a &quot;Spin Doctors-style career combustion&quot; in the future. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also panned the album, stating that it features &quot;some of the weakest rhymes and derivative white-bread dub in recent memory&quot; and concluded that the band did not know &quot;the thin line between experimentation and self-indulgence&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the album, saying it was &quot;trying too hard to expand their sonic horizons&quot;, and commented how they seem to unwillingly change their musical style.

===Retrospective reviews===
In contrast, the album was retrospectively received positively by Consequence of Sound, comparing it to The Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Commenting that &quot;the singles aren&#x27;t what make &quot;Transistor&quot; great. It&#x27;s the deep cuts that you play over and over again, trying to catch the meaning&quot;, they conclude that the album is &quot;one of a kind&quot;. Over time, &quot;Transistor&quot; has developed a cult following and become a fan favorite, eventually leading to the band performing the album in its entirety on August 6, 2011, in front of over 10,000 fans. This was done at their very own Pow Wow Festival, created to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the album. In 2017, the &quot;Willamette Week&quot; ranked &quot;Transistor&quot; as 311&#x27;s greatest album.
