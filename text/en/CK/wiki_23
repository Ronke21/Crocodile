<text>The 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix (officially the 2001 Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Sepang International Circuit in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia in front of a crowd of 75,000 spectators on 18 March 2001. It was the second round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the third Malaysian Grand Prix to be part of the series. The race was won from pole position by Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second and McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard was third.

After winning the preceding , the first race of the season, Michael Schumacher was first in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and his team Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. The Grand Prix was delayed and shortened from 56 to 55 laps because Giancarlo Fisichella of the Benetton team was out of position on the starting grid. When it did start, Michael Schumacher led the first two laps until he and Barrichello skidded on oil left by Olivier Panis&#x27; British American Racing (BAR) car, as a tropical monsoon begin to fall. They ran into a gravel trap and Jordan driver Jarno Trulli took the lead for one lap until he and several drivers aquaplaned in the deteriorating weather. Coulthard led for 11 laps after a phase of pit stops for wet-weather tyres before Michael Schumacher passed him on lap 16. Schumacher led the remainder of the race to achieve his second victory of the season and the 46th of his career.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s victory was his sixth in succession from pole position, bettering a record jointly held by former world champions Nigel Mansell and Alberto Ascari. The result left him ten points clear of Barrichello and Coulthard, who were tied in second, in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Jordan moved past Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld for fourth. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari further extended its advantage over second-place McLaren while Sauber fell to fourth behind Jordan with fifteen races left in the season.

==Background==
The 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix was the 2nd of the 17 races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 3rd edition of the event as part of the series. It was held at the 15-turn Sepang International Circuit in Sepang, Selangor on 18 March. A race sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), motorsport&#x27;s governing body, had been held in Malaysia since the 1960s, with the first editions being run in Singapore, then part of the Malaysian Federation, before moving to the Shah Alam Circuit. With the arrival of the Formula One Grand Prix in 1999, the race was moved to the purpose-built Sepang International Circuit, where all editions were held until 2017.

After winning the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with ten points, ahead of McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard with six and Rubens Barrichello in the second Ferrari with four. Nick Heidfeld of the Sauber team was fourth with three points and Jordan driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fifth on two points. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with 14 points; McLaren were in second on six points. Sauber was in third place with four points and Jordan in fourth had two points.

The press and bookmakers considered Michael Schumacher the favourite to win the Malaysian Grand Prix, his team Ferrari had won every single running of the race up to that point: Eddie Irvine in 1999 and Schumacher in . Some of the media attention focussed on the possibility of Michael Schumacher taking his sixth consecutive victory, which would have made him the first driver since the two-time world champion Alberto Ascari in 1952 to achieve the feat. He said he would not over relax after his victory in Melbourne: &quot;Every year we say here at Ferrari that it is our best car ever and this time, like Rubens, I feel it is true. But we have experience and we know things can go up and down very quickly so we are not going to be complacent or over-confident. That is not our style.&quot;

Following the death of track marshal Graham Beveridge, who was struck in the chest by a wheel from the car of British American Racing (BAR) driver Jacques Villeneuve at the Australian Grand Prix, the organisers of the Malaysian race worked to better protect trackside personnel and drivers; they did not request assistance from Formula One officials. Circuit officials moved back the kerbs at turns five and six, and moved guard rails at turns two and 15 back by . FIA race director and safety delegate Charlie Whiting approved both modifications. Safety marshals were urged by clerk of the course to be extra attentive while observing vehicles and to maintain care for fellow marshals. This came as executive director of the Malaysian Grand Prix and former driver Philippe Gurdjian presented a six-point advisory plan to all 700 circuit personnel including track marshals, firefighters and paramedics to improve safety.

There were 11 teams (each represented by a different constructor) fielded two race drivers for the event with no changes from the season entry list. All cars ran with the same rear wings as in Melbourne since the revised downforce regulations caused aerodynamicists to reclassify the Sepang International Circuit as a &quot;high-downforce track&quot;. After competing the season&#x27;s first round without a spare vehicle, half of the personnel working for the Minardi team returned to its bases in Italy and the United Kingdom to assemble, test and transport a spare car to Malaysia so that its drivers Fernando Alonso and Tarso Marques had a back-up plan if either one had a problem. Ferrari, McLaren and Benetton ran some aerodynamic modifications on their vehicles while Williams, Sauber, Prost, Arrows and Minardi all ran to the same specification as in Australia. McLaren installed larger brake cooling ducts to their MP4/16s and Jaguar on their R2s.

==Practice==

There were four practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race—two one-hour sessions on Friday, and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. Conditions for the two Friday practice sessions were clear, hot and humid with several cars struggling for grip. Barrichello led the morning session with a 1-minute 39.502 seconds lap, 0.621 seconds faster than his teammate Michael Schumacher in second. Jordan driver Jarno Trulli, Coulthard, Irvine, Heinz Frentzen, McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen, Olivier Panis for BAR, Jaguar&#x27;s Luciano Burti and Heidfeld in positions three to ten. Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya set no lap times due to a fuel pump failure and the Arrows car of Jos Verstappen stopped at turn three with an engine sensor fault. His teammate Enrique Bernoldi stopped at turn four with a clutch hydraulics problem about half a minute later.

In the afternoon session, Trulli recorded the day&#x27;s fastest lap at 1 minute 38.846 seconds. He was 0.083 seconds ahead of Michael Schumacher in second. Barrichello, Coulthard, Irvine, Häkkinen, Frentzen, Burti, Panis and Ralf Schumacher of the Williams team rounded out the session&#x27;s top ten drivers. Early in the session, Frentzen confronted the Sauber team principal Peter Sauber, who was angered at comments made by the former regarding the fast acceleration of his team&#x27;s vehicles exiting the corners in the Australian Grand Prix. Both engaged in a verbal argument, which was ended when Jordan team owner Eddie Jordan pulled Frentzen away from Peter Sauber. Battery problems sidelined Montoya and two fuel pump failures limited Alonso&#x27;s running to the final 20 minutes. His teammate Marques had an engine problem and Benetton&#x27;s Jenson Button set his first lap times after missing the first session due to an overheating gearbox.

It continued to be clear, hot and humid for the two Saturday morning practice sessions. With a time of 1 minute 36.814 seconds, Coulthard was fastest in the third session, followed by Barrichello in second and his Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher in third. Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Heidfeld. Frentzen, Montoya, Panis and Irvine were in positions four through ten. In the final session, Barrichello led with a lap of 1 minute 36.188 seconds. Second was Ralf Schumacher and Häkkinen third. Fourth was Michael Schumacher, Coulthard fifth and Frentzen improved to sixth. Trulli, Irvine, Panis and Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen occupied seventh to tenth places. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella ran into a gravel trap beside the circuit and Alonso stopped with smoke billowing from the rear of his car because of debris accumulation overheating his engine.

==Qualifying==
Saturday afternoon&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session saw each driver limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by each&#x27;s fastest lap. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver to set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Weather conditions were hot and sunny. Michael Schumacher completed two timed laps with new tyres and another two on used front wheels; he lost two-tenths of a second on his first attempt. He took his sixth consecutive pole position—becoming the first driver since Häkkinen in to achieve the feat—and the 34th of his career with a time of 1 minute 35.220 seconds. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by his teammate Barrichello who had lost time in the first two turns due to a strengthening wind. Ralf Schumacher initially led and traded pole position with both Ferrari drivers before falling to third. Häkkinen had a car balance problem that left him in fourth. Trulli in fifth had a lack of acclimatisation due to an electrical fault and could not fine-tune his car&#x27;s setup. Montoya, sixth, spun during the session, as Villeneuve, who said later he thought he drove too aggressively, took seventh. Coulthard, eighth, admitted to over-driving in the middle sector during his final attempt, losing him time. Excess understeer put Frentzen, who took ninth, off the track. Panis in tenth lost four-tenths of a second on his last timed lap.

Heidfeld was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten after driving on worn tyres on his first two timed laps and new front tyres on his third. He was followed by Irvine in 12th, who had understeer going into the second corner and Villeneuve slowed him into the final corner. Jean Alesi was the faster of the two Prost cars in 13th and spoke of his belief that the team had made progress from its pre-season testing form. After a change of left-rear suspension wishbone, Räikkönen took 14th; he ran wide due to an understeer and was prevented from doing a fourth lap because he was called to the weighbridge. A light fuel road and a changed car balance put Burti 15th. Fisichella switched to the spare B201 car setup for his teammate Button due to a minor chassis technical issue on his race car and he took 16th. An oversteer in the fast-speed corners before a setup alteration to improve his car&#x27;s balance put Button 17th. A lack of engine power and understeer left Verstappen in 18th. His teammate Bernoldi was blocked by Räikkönen on his final timed lap and was 19th. Gastón Mazzacane in the slower Prost car had his setup changed and improved his best time to go 20th-fastest. Understeer on Marques&#x27; first two attempts and setup improvements to correct it put him 21st. His teammate Alonso could not drive his race car because its gearbox and engine was replaced. He took the spare Minardi and was 22nd.

===Penalties===
31 minutes into qualifying, the stewards deleted all of Bernoldi&#x27;s lap times because the FIA technical delegate discovered the dimension of the Arrows A22&#x27;s front wing and parts of its bodywork lying on the step plane were less than a respective and above the plane of reference. The penalty promoted Mazzacane to 19th, Marques to 20th, Alonso to 21st and dropped Bernoldi to 22nd.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
A 30-minute warm-up session was held on Sunday morning, in hot and humid weather and on a saturated track created by a tropical thunderstorm that ended around 30 minutes before the session began, prompting most teams run the intermediate tyres on their cars. A dry line appeared towards the session&#x27;s end helped by warm temperatures and the top three runners set their fastest times this way. Barrichello was fastest with a lap of 1 minute 49.763 seconds. He was followed by Coulthard, Trulli, Räikkonen, Verstappen, Frentzen, Michael Schumacher, Heidfeld, Panis and Villeneuve. Alonso stopped on the start/finish straight with a fuel pump failure and he took the spare car originally setup for his teammate Marques. Irvine&#x27;s engine cut out, causing him to drive the spare Jaguar. Fisichella spun twice and his teammate Button was observed driving on the dry compound tyres for three laps towards the end of warm-up.

==Race==
The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 MST and in front of a crowd of 75,000 spectators. The weather at the start was overcast but hot and humid. The air temperature ranged from and the track temperature ; forecasts four days earlier predicted conditions to be consistent with sunny skies. Every driver, except for Burti, began on the soft compound tyres. Most teams had anticipated the possibility of rain but it was not much of a threat for them to make their cars suitable for wet-weather. Five minutes before the pit lane was officially closed, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s race car had an oil leak, prompting him to drive the spare Ferrari that was setup for his teammate Barrichello. He avoided a pit lane start because he exited the area one minute before it closed.

On the formation lap, Frentzen&#x27;s engine misfired due to a computer-hardware error that limited his rev limiter to 4,000 rpm as he drove away from his starting slot. Just before the race was due to start, Fisichella was out of position because he missed his starting slot and was stranded in the middle of the grid. He drove to his original starting position and was perpendicular across the track with not enough steering lock and rolled between the two cars ahead and behind him. Because series regulations barred drivers from reversing, this resulted in an aborted start. A new start time of 14:10 MST was planned and the race was shortened from 56 to 55 laps over a distance of since drivers were required to do a second formation lap. During this lap Montoya ran to his garage to take the spare vehicle because his race car had an engine problem.

Michael Schumacher, from the pole position, made a brisk getaway to maintain his startline advantage going into the first corner. His teammate Barrichello made a slow start and fell from second to fourth as Trulli was to the left of him and Ralf Schumacher to his right. Ralf Schumacher slid before turn one and he defended his position at the corner. That caused the left-front corner of Barrichello&#x27;s Ferrari and the rear of Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Williams car to connect; Schumacher spun 180 degrees in front of the pack, sending him to the rear of the field. In doing so, Irvine was sent into a half-spin by Verstappen as Räikkönen drove near the pit lane wall with a broken transmission. Elsewhere, Häkkinen slowed to avoid piling into Ralf Schumacher. He fell from fourth to eighth as his teammate Coulthard moved from eighth to fourth after going into the grass to avoid the incidents. Verstappen moved from 18th to sixth by the end of the first lap by driving on the inside, as Ralf Schumacher fell from third to 20th over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led his teammate Barrichello in second by 1.3 seconds, with Trulli a further 1.8 seconds behind in third.

As the two Ferraris pulled away from the rest of the field on lap two, Panis&#x27; engine failed, pitching his car backwards into the gravel trap. Leaking oil pooled on the track and dripped onto his hot exhaust, where it ignited. Fisichella overtook his teammate Button for 11th as Ralf Schumacher moved from 20th to 14th. An unexpected monsoon shower began to fall on lap three. The two Ferraris continued to pull further away from the rest of the field, although they were unaware of Panis&#x27; deposited oil because they had not been told of it in time by the marshals. Both drivers slid on the oil and into the gravel trap, and navigated back onto the track in third and seventh. Trulli took the lead with Coulthard in second. None of the leaders made pit stops to switch to wet-weather compound tyres immediately because half of the track was dry while the final hairpin was flooded as some areas did not have adequate drainage. On lap four, Montoya, Bernoldi, Heidfeld and Villeneuve aquaplaned into a gravel trap and retired. Whiting deployed the safety car on the lap though several cars, including Trulli, Coulthard and Barrichello, aquaplaned into the turn 15 hairpin.

During the safety car period, several drivers made pit stops for rain tyres. Although he had no radio communication with his team, Coulthard exited the pit lane leading while Ferrari had a fraught stop. Barrichello&#x27;s second error and Michael Schumacher being three seconds behind on the lap before meant Ferrari believed that the latter was ahead. After Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn called both Michael Schumacher and his teammate Barrichello for their first pit stops, Schumacher sat behind Barrichello for 1 minute and 12 seconds because the team was missing Barrichello&#x27;s front-right wheel since Brawn mistakenly told the mechanics that Schumacher was ahead; debris also had to be removed from Barrichello&#x27;s bargeboard that was removed. The duo emerged in 10th and 11th. Rain stopped falling by lap seven although there was a large amount of standing water as the safety car remained on track for the next three laps. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap 10, and Coulthard led from Frentzen and Verstappen at the lap-11 restart. He began to pull away from the rest of the field as Verstappen slipstreamed Frentzen on the back straight and out-braked him for second at the turn 15 hairpin. On lap 12, Frenzten fell to fifth when Häkkinen and Ralf Schumacher passed him. Barrichello radioed Brawn about dirt on the track and that his teammate Michael Schumacher should take care. During the lap, Schumacher, on a light fuel load and whose engine almost overheated in the pit lane, went onto the dirt to pass Barrichello, who went to the left of Trulli at turn five and was blocked by him.

Michael Schumacher overtook Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher and Häkkinen off the racing line on the 13th lap. He approached Verstappen in second on the next lap though Verstappen twice blocked his path. Further back, his teammate Barrichello passed Ralf Schumacher and Häkkinen took fourth. On the 15th lap, Michael Schumacher overtook Verstappen on the inside for second and began to draw closer to Coulthard, who drove with an understeer. He passed Coulthard on the right for the lead on the start/finish straight linking the final and first corners on lap 16. That lap, Barrichello overtook Verstappen and Coulthard to advance to second as Michael Schumacher began to pull away by five seconds. It appeared at this point that Ferrari would win the race comfortably barring a mechanical issue. Häkkinen and Ralf Schumacher were the first two drivers to enter the pit lane and switch from the full wet compound tyres to the dry compound tyres on lap 17. Barrichello made his second stop four laps later in which the second bargeboard was removed from his car, emerging in fourth. Coulthard fell to 40 seconds behind the Ferraris by the time of his second stop on lap 25. He rejoined the race in third, more than 20 seconds behind Barrichello.

In the meantime, Ralf Schumacher overtook Frentzen for fifth on lap 24 and Häkkinen for fourth four laps later. On lap 27 Mazzacane delayed Häkkinen and Verstappen, who were in the act of lapping him. When Häkkinen got past, Button followed through for 14th after being previously unable to overtake Mazzacane. Light rain began to fall again on lap 28 though it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Michael Schumacher led by 67 seconds when he made his second pit stop on lap 30 for a front wing adjustment and fuel to complete the race. He rejoined 28 seconds ahead of his teammate Barrichello in second. Further back, Verstappen lost fourth to Ralf Schumacher on lap 31. Fisichella in ninth became the race&#x27;s final retiree with no fuel pressure at the pit lane entrance the lap after. Around this time, Häkkinen duelled Verstappen for fifth though he could not pass and allowed Frentzen to gain on the pair. Verstappen defended fifth by out-braking Häkkinen at the turn 15 hairpin on lap 38; the manoeuvre put Häkkinen wide and allowed Frentzen to overtake him for sixth. Barrichello made his final pit stop three laps later and he remained in second. Verstappen entered the pit lane for the third time on the 43rd lap to take on enough fuel to complete the race.

The track was entirely dry by lap 47 as Coulthard lowered the deficit behind Barrichello to 4.5 seconds. One lap later, Häkkinen set the race&#x27;s overall fastest lap, at 1 minute 40.962 seconds, as he pursued Ralf Schumacher in fifth. However, he did not have enough traction exiting the corners to pass Ralf Schumacher, whose more powerful engine gave him a straight-line speed advantage on the main straights, but emitted a large amount of carbon brake dust each time he braked into the heavy braking zones. Michael Schumacher reduced his pace since overtaking caused by blocked radiators was a possible worry for him but maintained the lead to take his second victory of the season, and the 46th of his career, overtaking Nigel Mansell&#x27;s and Ascari&#x27;s joint record of five victories in a row from pole position with his sixth. Barrichello was 23.660 seconds behind in second and Coulthard came third. Frentzen&#x27;s scheduled two-stop strategy put him fourth despite locking rear wheels and was ordered by Jordan to stop at the end of the pit lane barrier because he needed to have enough fuel in his car to pass a post-race FIA analysis. Ralf Schumacher in fifth held off Häkkinen in sixth. Outside of the points-scoring positions, Verstappen, Trulli, Alesi, Burti, Button and Mazzacane followed in positions seven to twelve. The Minardi cars were the final two finishers, Alonso ahead of Marques; the latter was delayed by a right-rear puncture.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Michael Schumacher called the race &quot;exciting&quot; and said it reminded him of his victory at the 1996 Spanish Grand Prix, &quot;It was probably the same story, but honestly it&#x27;s great being somehow dominant, but we know that won&#x27;t be the case for every coming race now. It was special conditions, special circumstances, and we used them well for us.&quot; Barrichello said that he made an extra pit stop to have debris removed from his car, adding, &quot;I think we have a good car, a fantastic car actually, the best car I have ever driven, like I have said. Once I came on the radio to say that I saw some bits of the car flying, and that&#x27;s basically was some of the barge boards and maybe the brake duct or something.&quot; Coulthard stated he was unsurprised at Ferrari&#x27;s faster speed, &quot;They clearly have a car advantage at this time, very similar to the sort of advantage we probably had in &#x27;98, and that allows you, if you make the right calls, to really drive at the pace you want to relative to others. So it&#x27;s quite clear to everyone that they&#x27;re the class of the field at the moment and we have a lot of work to do to catch up.&quot;

Ralf Schumacher said he felt the first lap collision with Barrichello prevented him from finishing on the podium and noted it was the second collision the latter had with a German driver in the past two races, &quot;He should learn the rules. It is a racing accident but it difficult to understand how it happened because the car in front usually has the priority in the corner.&quot; Barrichello argued that Ralf Schumacher had not provided him with enough space to negotiate through, &quot;If he comes around the outside, he leaves some room for a line. But I had no room or line and I had to let the car roll. He was in front and suddenly he shut the door and that was where we touched.&quot; Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, said he was certain the decision to run his cars on the wet tyres was correct, &quot;Are we disappointed? Not really, but we are more frustrated. Today was one of those days when you have to make a decision and we made ours to go on wets and they (Ferrari) took a risk and went on intermediates.&quot; Brawn stated Ferrari had information from testing at the Fiorano Circuit that the intermediate tyres operated efficiently in deep standing water, &quot;We knew there were dry parts of the track and we knew there were wet parts of the track and we knew the tyres were very good in the morning [warm-up] as well. That was what we ran this morning. We knew it was very good and we knew it would go into the dry.&quot;

Irvine described the weather conditions that were observed early in the race as &quot;worse than Spa proportions, the rain was of Suzuka proportions – just like the weather at the race in Japan in 1995.&quot; Villeneuve said that &quot;It was just undriveable in those conditions. It was a big downpour. I couldn&#x27;t see anything and what made it more dangerous was that everyone was on dry tyres and did not have their red lights on.&quot; Verstappen said that although he was disappointed to score no points he was still pleased, &quot;It was great to play with the big boys. It showed all the F1 teams that I can drive. You need equipment to win races, and I think that if I had the right equipment, I could do it.&quot;

Fisichella apologised to the Benetton team over the radio for missing his starting position that led to the start being aborted. He said that he was focused on ensuring his car was setup to his liking and only saw the vehicle ahead of him. The Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore did not reprimand Fisichella, but praised him for moving to seventh place before retiring. The result extended Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 10 points over Barrichello and Coulthard, tied for second place. Frentzen moved past his compatriot Heidfeld for fourth. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari further increased their advantage over McLaren to 19 points while Jordan passed Sauber for third and Williams in fifth registered their first points of the season with Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s fifth-place finish with fifteen races left in the season.

<text>Jason Andre Davis Roberts MBE (born 25 January 1978) is a former professional footballer who is now Chief Football Development Officer at CONCACAF.

Born in Park Royal, London, Roberts was playing football from an early age, and spent time in the youth academies at several professional clubs, but was not retained. After a spell in non-league football with Hayes, he joined Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1997. He failed to make a first-team appearance for Wolves, and had loan spells at Torquay United and Bristol City before signing for Bristol Rovers in 1998. He quickly established himself in the first team, scoring 38 goals in his two seasons at the club.

After the club failed to gain promotion, Roberts handed in a transfer request and was sold to West Bromwich Albion in July 2000. His goals helped the team reach the First Division play-offs in his first season at the club, then promotion to the Premier League in the following season. Roberts scored three goals in his first Premier League season as the club were relegated back down to the First Division. He was loaned out to Portsmouth at the start of the 2003–04 season, and was then sold to Wigan Athletic in January 2004. He scored 21 goals in Wigan&#x27;s promotion-winning campaign in the 2004–05 season, and won the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award at the end of the season. His goals in the following season helped the club finish tenth in its inaugural Premier League campaign, as well as taking them to the 2006 Football League Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium – the club&#x27;s first ever major cup final.

After failing to agree a new contract with Wigan, he was sold to Blackburn Rovers in 2006, where he played European football for the first time. He made 156 appearances for Blackburn, scoring 28 goals. In 2007, he established the Jason Roberts Foundation, and was awarded an MBE for services to sport in 2010 New Year Honours – Grenada. In 2011, he began working as a presenter for BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;6-0-6&quot; programme. In January 2012. he signed for Reading on an eighteen-month contract and helped them to promotion from the Football League Championship as champions. On 20 March 2014, he announced his immediate retirement from the game due to persistent injuries.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Roberts was born in Central Middlesex Hospital, north-west London. He grew up in Stonebridge, in the London Borough of Brent. Roberts was born into a sporting family: his uncles Cyrille Regis, Dave Regis and Otis Roberts all had careers as professional footballers, while another uncle, John Regis, is a former Olympic sprinter. He began playing football from the age of six, and was scouted by several professional clubs while playing for Parkfield Youth. He trained at the youth academies of a number of these clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur, Watford, and Chelsea, but failed to earn a contract. He then spent time on trial at Wycombe Wanderers, but was not offered a permanent deal at the club.

After being rejected by Wycombe, Roberts spent more than a year away from football. He began working as an export clerk, and was considering quitting the game altogether. Only when his uncle Cyrille arranged a trial at former club Hayes in the Isthmian League Premier Division Roberts returned to football. He did enough to impress the club and signed a part-time contract worth £15 per week. He made his debut in November 1995, the season Hayes won promotion to the Football Conference. After scoring five goals early in the 1997–98 season, he was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for £250,000, before moving to Torquay United on loan, where he scored six goals in 13 games. These goals came as Torquay struggled and won a relegation battle. Another loan took him to Bristol City, where he scored one goal against Oldham in three appearances.

He joined Bristol Rovers for £250,000 in August 1998. In the 1998–99 season, Roberts scored 16 goals in 37 league appearances, and was one of the top goal scorers in the FA Cup with a total of seven goals. He continued his plunder in the next season, scoring 22 goals in 41 appearances. In the summer of 2000 however, following Rovers&#x27; failure to gain promotion, he handed in a transfer request to the club.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Roberts moved to West Bromwich Albion on 26 July 2000, for a club record £2 million fee. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat away at Nottingham Forest on 12 August, the opening day of the 2000–01 season. He scored twice against Swansea City in the League Cup on 6 September, his first goals for the club. Roberts scored 17 goals in 50 appearances in 2000–01; he formed a successful partnership with Lee Hughes and took Albion to the First Division playoffs. During the successful promotion campaign of 2001–02 however, his season was blighted by a persistent foot injury, breaking his fifth metatarsal three times. He managed 14 league appearances during the season, scoring seven goals.

Despite being fully fit for 2002–03, Albion&#x27;s first season in the Premier League, Roberts managed only three goals in 32 games. He was loaned out for much of the 2003–04 season to Portsmouth, where he scored once against Everton, with three further goals in the League Cup against Northampton Town (2) and Nottingham Forest. A transfer request during mid-season saw him move to Wigan Athletic for a fee of £1.4 million, potentially rising to £2 million.

===Wigan Athletic===
Roberts made his debut for Wigan on 17 January 2004 in a 4–2 win against Preston North End, scoring his first goal for the club inside the first 35 seconds of the match. He made a good start to his career at the club, scoring eight goals in 14 appearances to round out the 2003–04 season. Roberts continued to find the net in the 2004–05 campaign, ending the season with 21 goals in league play—second in The Championship, behind teammate Nathan Ellington. Both players were named in the PFA Championship team of the season. Wigan finished second in the table behind Sunderland, earning automatic promotion to the Premier League. It was his penalty kick goal in the second minute of their 27 August 2005 match against Sunderland that served as the first Premier League goal for the Latics and led them to the first top-flight victory in Wigan Athletic&#x27;s history.

With Wigan Athletic&#x27;s promotion to the top flight of English football in May 2005, Jason Roberts was able to establish himself in the Premier League. His goals enabled Wigan to finish the season comfortably in the top half and challenge for a European place in only their first season in the top division of English football. This success was encapsulated in one moment on 24 January 2006—when Roberts himself scored a last minute goal against Arsenal at Highbury in the League Cup semi-final to send Wigan to the first major cup final in their history. He would go on to start for Wigan in the final against Manchester United.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 3 July 2006, he joined Blackburn Rovers on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal for Blackburn in the 2–1 FA Cup semi-final defeat against Chelsea, he missed three months of the season with a broken foot. Roberts kept this momentum towards the end of the 2006–07 season by netting five goals in as many games.

The following season, he struggled to maintain a place in the Blackburn starting line up due to the signing of Bayern Munich striker Roque Santa Cruz. However, after a solo goal at rivals Bolton Wanderers, he claimed back his place and took part in many games towards the end of the season netting some goals and forging a good partnership with Santa Cruz.

Roberts scored seven league goals in the 2008–09 season, as Blackburn struggled in the league finishing 15th. He signed a new deal in November 2008 which kept him at Ewood Park until the summer of 2011. By the end of the 2009–10 season, Roberts had scored five goals in 31 appearances, helping Blackburn finish 10th in the league.

===Reading===
On 26 January 2012, Roberts signed for Reading on an eighteen-month contract. Roberts scored on his debut against Bristol City on 26 January 2012; when David James saved his penalty and Roberts bundled the ball over the line from the rebound. His second goal came on 11 February against Coventry City, where he deflected in a Matthew Connolly header. He scored his third goal in four starts in a 1–0 win against Burnley, after looping a Jobi McAnuff cross over keeper Lee Grant. On 10 March, Roberts got on the scoresheet again with a goal from close in to the bottom left corner of the goal, against Leicester City, in a 3–1 win. Reading&#x27;s matchday edition of the Royals, revealed that Roberts had officially made the best ever start to a Reading career by helping them achieve an eight-game winning run, while also scoring four times and providing five assists. He scored his sixth goal for Reading in an important top of the table clash against Southampton, connecting with Jimmy Kébé&#x27;s pinpoint cross.

On 21 February 2014, having not played for more than a year due to a persistent hip injury, Roberts told the matchday announcer he was unlikely to play again and on 20 March 2014 he announced his retirement from football.

==International career==
With Grenada national team, Roberts scored in qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup against the United States.

Roberts scored the first two goals of a 10–0 rout of the US Virgin Islands on 26 March 2008, in the first game of 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.

Roberts qualified to play for Grenada through his father, who was born there. His mother was born in French Guiana.

==Media career==
In Wigan&#x27;s first season in the Premier League, Roberts wrote a weekly blog for the BBC Sport&#x27;s website. In August 2011 he was announced as a new presenter on &quot;6-0-6&quot; and made his first appearance on &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; in November 2011. He appeared on &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; for the second time on 15 January 2012, the third time on 1 April and a fourth on 11 November. He worked as a co-commentator at the 2014 FIFA World Cup for 5 Live and joined the BBC full-time at the start of the 2014–2015 season to work as a pundit and co-commentator.

==Post-playing career==
Jason Roberts was named Concacaf Director of Development in November 2017. He is a member of the FIFA Players&#x27; Status Committee and is based in Miami, Florida.

==Personal life==
Roberts is a fan of Celtic and supported them growing up.

In Spring 2007, he founded the Jason Roberts Foundation, which aims &quot;to provide a range of sporting opportunities for children and young people in the UK and Grenada&quot;.

Roberts comes from a prominent sporting family: his uncles include former footballers Cyrille Regis, Dave Regis, and Otis Roberts (a former Grenada international who played in Hong Kong and Belgium). He is also related to Olympic medallist John Regis, who was Cyrille&#x27;s cousin.

Roberts was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours list, for his services to sport in Grenada and in London, England. Upon receiving the award he stated in one of Blackburn&#x27;s match-day programme notes that he was humbled to get it and thanks everyone who has supported his charity work.

<text>The 2001 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXX Grande Prêmio Marlboro do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held before 70,000 spectators on 1 April 2001 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo, Brazil. It was the third race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the only one held in South America. Starting from fifth place, McLaren driver David Coulthard won the 71-lap race. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher finished second with Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld third.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship before the race, while Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. He secured pole position by setting the quickest lap in the one-hour qualifying session. The race was interrupted after McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s engine stalled on the starting grid, prompting the safety car&#x27;s deployment. When the safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap two, Williams&#x27; Juan Pablo Montoya overtook Schumacher for the lead. Montoya led the next 36 laps before he was hit by Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen on lap 39, forcing both drivers to retire from the race. As a result, Coulthard took the race lead and held it until the pit stops for wet-weather tyres, when the rain became heavier, and Schumacher took it for two laps until Coulthard passed him on lap 50. Coulthard led the rest of the race and won by 16.1 seconds over Schumacher, the only other driver on the lead lap.

Coulthard&#x27;s tenth victory of his career reduced Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to six points along with him moving up to second place, 10 points ahead of Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello in third. McLaren cut Ferrari&#x27;s World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead to 15 points with 14 races remaining in the season.

==Background==

The 2001 Brazilian Grand Prix, the third round of seventeen in the 2001 Formula One World Championship, took place on 1 April 2001, at the anti-clockwise Autódromo José Carlos Pace track in São Paulo, Brazil. It was the season&#x27;s lone South American event, and the third in a row outside of Europe. The Grand Prix featured eleven teams of two drivers (each representing a different constructor), with no changes to the season entry list. Tyre suppliers Bridgestone and Michelin brought two dry compounds and three wet-weather tyres to Brazil.

Going into the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 20 points, ahead of teammate Rubens Barrichello and McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard, who were tied for second with ten points. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fourth with five points, followed by Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld in fifth with three. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 30 points, while McLaren were second with 11. Jordan and Sauber were third and fourth, with five and four points, respectively, and Williams were fifth with two.

Following the on March 18, nine of the eleven teams tested tyres, car and electrical components, and racing setups on their cars at Spain&#x27;s Circuit de Catalunya from 20 to 23 March in preparation for the Brazilian Grand Prix. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren&#x27;s test driver Alexander Wurz. Badoer remained fastest on the second day. Marc Gené, the Williams test driver, stopped on track with a mechanical failure which briefly stopped testing. Michael Schumacher was fastest on the third day of testing. Seven suspensions were required as several drivers had car problems or spun off the circuit. Michael Schumacher stayed fastest for the final day&#x27;s running. Both the Minardi and Sauber teams did not do any testing. Sauber&#x27;s technical department focused on preparing updated aerodynamic components that were optimised at the factory, whereas Minardi worked at their factory to improve car reliability.

Michael Schumacher won the season&#x27;s first two races in Australia and Malaysia. Although he was the bookmakers&#x27; favourite to win the race, he noted that the warm weather could make it difficult for drivers and their cars, adding, &quot;We have proven the car&#x27;s reliability in two tough races right at the start of the season, which is encouraging going into the Brazilian race&quot;. Barrichello did not remember a time he was very excited for a race because of his Ferrari&#x27;s competitiveness, and was certain of beating his teammate Michael Schumacher to win, saying, &quot;I know what it would mean to the fans especially to see a home winner.&quot; McLaren co-ordinator Jo Ramírez admitted &quot;We were and we are still lost&quot; because their car was slower than Ferrari&#x27;s in the first two rounds, &quot;Frankly, I don&#x27;t know what we will be able to do at this Grand Prix. We are lost. This car is not up to the McLaren tradition.&quot; McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen stated that winning in Brazil was his team&#x27;s primary goal, while teammate Coulthard expressed hope that they could maintain its history of success in Brazil.

Following last year&#x27;s race, the track underwent safety upgrades. In response to marshal Graham Beveridge&#x27;s death at the Australian race, 21 cabins were erected to safeguard marshals across the track. Animals that were roaming near the circuit boundaries were rounded up and relocated. A guard rail was constructed at the Bico do Pato turn as car speeds increased greatly since 2000. The gravel trap along the Reta Oposta straight was reinforced and the circuit&#x27;s drainage system was fixed. On 17 March, a contractor&#x27;s dissatisfaction with São Paulo city administration caused a disruption in the renovation work, prompting inquiries. Construction workers continued to work on the track prior to the first practice session. The issue, involving the delayed supply of tables and chairs, was confirmed by race organisers and would not disrupt the Grand Prix. Barrichello criticised the Grand Prix, citing the displeasure of some drivers in previous years and the quality of the local facilities. However, the event&#x27;s director, Carlos Roberto Montagne, refuted Barrichello&#x27;s assertions, saying that the road surface was approved by two British engineers. However, the drivers were dissatisfied with the work because the track remained bumpy. Häkkinen described the track as &quot;very bumpy indeed. It seems to get worse and worse every year.&quot; Minardi&#x27;s Fernando Alonso claimed that the bumping was so bad that one could have lost their vision of the circuit. 

Several teams introduced no significant technical changes to their cars, instead waiting for the season&#x27;s first European race, the , two weeks after the race in Brazil. McLaren introduced four front wing specifications in an attempt to reduce the MP4-16&#x27;s understeer but eventually oriented on a new front wing profile. Williams debuted a new rear wing, while Benetton postponed the debut of its lower front side appendages to the San Marino Grand Prix due to creating drag and downforce, slowing their B201 car during practice. British American Racing (BAR) tested two rear wing configurations and a modified upswept exhaust to increase the 003&#x27;s engine revolutions while avoiding gearbox overheating. Sauber added two new sidepod winglets in front of the air extractor chimneys to increase downforce as Jaguar lowered the size of the R2&#x27;s bargeboards and extended the front wing endplates to improve efficiency and deflect air inside the front wheels. Prost added updated aerodynamic profiles to the AP04&#x27;s front wishbones as well as minor rear suspension geometry modifications.

==Practice==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The first morning practice session was held in sunny weather on a dusty track that was cleaned by cars; no rain was expected. Michael Schumacher led the first practice session, setting a lap of 1:16.832 with 23 minutes left. Häkkinen was second and was fastest for the first quarter of the practice until spinning off midway through after likely driving onto dirt rather than a lack of car grip. Barrichello, Coulthard, BAR&#x27;s Olivier Panis, the Jaguars of Eddie Irvine and Luciano Burti, Williams&#x27; Juan Pablo Montoya, Heidfeld and Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli rounded out the session&#x27;s top ten fastest drivers.

It became warmer but overcast for the second practice session. Early in the session, Coulthard set the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:15.520 on new tyres, one second quicker than Trulli. He tried to lap faster but missed the braking point for Curva do Sol corner and spun into the gravel trap. Michael Schumacher was third after suffering a puncture from driving over a nail. Montoya and Ralf Schumacher of Williams (who ran off the track at turn ten, damaging his car&#x27;s front aerodynamic devices) were fourth and sixth, separated by Häkkinen. Barrichello, seventh, spun off after 22 minutes after his engine lost power due to a loss of oil pressure and stalled. Because the sporting regulations prohibited him from driving the backup car, Barrichello had insufficient on-track driving to setup his car for the race. Frentzen (who stopped on track at Subida do Lago corner when his engine suddenly cut out with more than 20 minutes remaining), Heidfeld and Irvine followed in the top ten.

It got hotter during Saturday&#x27;s free practice sessions. Häkkinen led the third practice session, lapping at 1:14.503, with teammate Coulthard second. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello were third and fifth fastest, followed by Ralf Schumacher. Montoya, Trulli, Frentzen, Heidfeld, and Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen completed the top ten. Burti lost control of his Jaguar but recovered to continue driving. Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s Benetton car stopped in the grass due to an engine oil leak.

In the final practice session, Montoya was quickest with a lap of 1:13.963, lapping faster than the 2000 pole time; Ralf Schumacher was fourth. The two McLarens split them, with Häkkinen in second and Coulthard in third. Michael Schumacher was fifth, ahead of Frentzen, Barrichello, Räikkönen, Panis and Heidfeld. Frentzen&#x27;s engine failed before the pit lane on his final lap of the session and marshals moved his car into the pit lane, smoke billowing from the rear. BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve and Irvine stopped their cars close to each other in the grass with gearbox hydraulic trouble.

==Qualifying==
Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. Qualifying was contested in hot, sunny weather with no rain forecast, stopping the top teams from lapping faster near the end of the session. The pole lap was only three-tenths of a second faster than the 2000 race due to track resurfacing, deterioration, and caution from both tyre suppliers due to an abrasive, bumpy surface and the circuit&#x27;s several high-speed turns. After aborting his second run because it was too slow following an error that put him wide at turn four, Michael Schumacher clinched his seventh straight pole position and the 35th of his career with a time of 1:13.780 with 16 minutes left, moving him to one pole away from equalling Ayrton Senna&#x27;s record of eight consecutive poles set between and . He was joined on the front row by Ralf Schumacher, who qualified 0.310 seconds slower despite reporting a tough vehicle to drive, equaling his team&#x27;s best qualifying position since the 1998 Italian Grand Prix. They became the first siblings to share the front row of a Formula One World Championship event. Häkkinen and Coulthard took third and fifth, respectively. Both drivers agreed that their cars were less inclined to understeer, and their first runs were hampered by Montoya spinning off the track. Coulthard&#x27;s first run was ended early due to Villeneuve slowing him at Junção corner. Part of his car&#x27;s undertray was damaged on the banking going onto the pit lane straight. Montoya separated the McLaren duo in fourth, having lost control of the rear of his Williams car at the fast left-hand Mergulho corner and collided with the tyre barrier on the far side of the track on his first quick lap. Montoya was unhurt, and returned to the pit lane, where the mechanics setup the spare car for him for the rest of qualifying. 

Barrichello was four tenths of a second slower than Michael Schumacher in sixth, claiming excess understeer for handling issues on new tyres. The two Jordans were upgraded with race-specification engines between the final practice session and qualifying, with Trulli qualifying seventh and Frentzen eighth; the latter was the last driver to be within a second of the pole lap and had to abort his third run due to the presence of a slower car. This formation continued onto the fifth row, occupied by Sauber&#x27;s Heidfeld and Räikkönen, with the former changing his set-up to move ahead of his teammate. The BARs of Panis and Villeneuve occupied the sixth row, and both drivers complained of a lack of grip in the slow-speed turns; Panis spun early in qualifying, and Villeneuve struck the kerb on the inside of turn eight, losing control of his car on his first run. Irvine and Burti (after an error that cost him two-tenths of a second from the final turn to the finish line) were 13th and 14th in their Jaguars in the final ten minutes of qualifying when the track was cooler and their car balances improved, ahead of Jean Alesi in the faster of the two Prosts after a car imbalance exacerbated by excess oversteer. Enrique Bernoldi took 16th for the Arrows team, ahead of teammate Jos Verstappen, who changed his car&#x27;s setup in practice to try to remove understeer but ended up with oversteer in qualifying. Benetton&#x27;s Fisichella and Jenson Button took 18th and 20th, respectively, due to engine oil leaks and poor car balance; Button had a minor oversteer issue at the end of qualifying. They were separated by Alonso in the quicker Minardi, who believed he could have qualified ahead of Fisichella if not for slower traffic on an aborted final run. Prost&#x27;s Gastón Mazzacane, who like his teammate Alesi had an imbalanced car, took 21st. Minardi&#x27;s Tarso Marques, 22nd, had an engine change that prevented his team from knowing his car&#x27;s qualifying setup.

=== Post-qualifying ===
After the session, scrutineers examined Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s car for a fuel irregularity since the first sample of allowed fuel differed from that approved by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body). Williams, the FIA&#x27;s technical delegate, and the FIA&#x27;s fuel analyst agreed to test a second sample and the stewards permitted Ralf Schumacher to start the race from second rather than last after the fuel was declared legal later that night.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
A 30-minute warm-up session was held on the morning of the race to give teams a final opportunity to check and modify their cars before the race. Both Ferraris were running quickly throughout warm-up, with Michael Schumacher setting the fastest time of 1:15.971, the only lap time below 1:16, with a full tank of fuel and an old set of tyres. He also drove his race car and Ferrari&#x27;s spare car during warm-up. Barrichello and Häkkinen were second and third, respectively. Ralf Schumacher was fourth, setting a lap four tenths of a second slower than Michael Schumacher. With five minutes remaining, Alonso went into the gravel trap and his car rested in the tyre barriers, breaking his front wing. Alonso was unhurt but the yellow flags were waved.

==Race==
The race started before 70,000 spectators at 14:00 local time, in dry conditions but dark, grey clouds had built up over the track. The air temperature was and the track temperature ranged from ; a 50% probability of rain was forecast. On a pre-race reconnaissance lap, Barrichello had to stop his Ferrari on the grass at the far side of the track because of an oil pressure fault caused by a fuel pump failure. He returned to the pit lane to drive the spare car that was setup for his teammate Michael Schumacher and had its settings adjusted for him. Irvine&#x27;s mechanics had difficulty starting his car&#x27;s engine while stationary on the grid, and they did not removed their garage equipment from the track by the 15-second mark, signalling the start of the formation lap. He received a ten-second stop-and-go penalty and Jaguar summoned him to serve the penalty in the pit lane on lap six.

When the race started, Häkkinen aimed his car to the left and moved slightly before the five-red light sequence was completed. He then released the clutch too early because of the way it was setup and stalled the engine. Häkkinen raised his hands to inform the 18 drivers behind him, who were able to avoid colliding into his car and cause a major accident; he was so upset that he forgot to properly reattach the steering wheel, a violation of the sporting regulations. The track layout prevented marshals from moving Häkkinen&#x27;s car off the main straight into a gap in the pit lane wall, forcing them to push it forward. This, along with the circuit&#x27;s short length, caused the safety car&#x27;s deployment. Before that, Montoya had risen from fourth to second, while Ralf Schumacher had fallen from second to fifth due to a poor start in which he was overtaken on the inside by Coulthard at turn one and pushed down further by Trulli.

Häkkinen&#x27;s car was removed from the track by the end of the second lap, and the safety car was withdrawn. With limited distance to accelerate between the pit lane and the start/finish line, Montoya on cold tyres remained close behind Michael Schumacher. He used his more powerful engine to aggressively overtake Schumacher on the unclean inside line by braking later at the Senna S chicane for the race lead. Both drivers made contact and Montoya drove Michael Schumacher wide right onto the grass in the middle of the turn to take the lead into the Curva do Sol corner. On the second straight, Barrichello missed his braking point and collided with the rear of Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s car, which had been pushed off the track by Trulli but had driven back to the right into Descida de Lago corner, removing Barrichello&#x27;s front-left wheel and front wing, as well as Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s rear wing. Barrichello spun out in the gravel trap and retired while Ralf Schumacher went to the pits for extensive rear-end repairs and fell four laps behind.

Montoya recorded a succession of fastest laps to open up a modest lead over Michael Schumacher, who was unable to pass due to Montoya&#x27;s more powerful engine keeping him ahead on the straights and holding Schumacher off in the turns. Montoya had more fuel in his car than Michael Schumacher, and expected to lose grip on his tyres after the first few laps, but keeping ahead may mean greater grip after about six laps. Panis overtook Alesi, Räikkönen, and Heidfeld to move into seventh place from laps seven to nine. The leading three drivers in the race had already pulled away from the rest of the field,with Villeneuve and Frentzen battling for fifth. Villeneuve made an unplanned pit stop on lap 12. He thought he had a puncture, but BAR discovered a broken differential, resulting in loose handling throughout the race. This moved Panis to sixth place, where he competed with Frentzen for fifth. Panis overtook Frentzen on the inside for fifth on lap 15 and closed up to Trulli in fourth. Bernoldi was forced to retire on the following lap due to a gear selection fault caused by a hydraulic issue.

Panis moved into fourth place on lap 20 after passing Trulli at the first turn. Montoya increased his lead over Michael Schumacher to more than a second for the first time in the race on the 21st lap, while Coulthard was a second behind in third place because his team had altered his car to be suitable for a wet track because they expected rain later in the race. Alesi in ninth became the first driver on a two-stop strategy to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 24. His stop took 15 seconds longer than expected due to a refuelling rig issue that prevented fuel from entering the car. Ferrari, McLaren, and Williams had differing pit stop strategies: Ferrari planned two stops, while McLaren and Williams planned only one. Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn and race engineer Luca Baldisserri called Michael Schumacher into the pit lane on the following lap. His stop took 9.6 seconds and he rejoined the race in fifth place. On lap 28, Alonso retired in the pit lane due to an potentiometer failure in the throttle mechanism, which produced engine trouble.

Michael Schumacher braked later than Trulli at the first turn, passing him for fourth on lap 28 and moving up to third when Panis made a pit stop on the following lap. Even though he was not hampered, Michael Schumacher was not lapping faster than Montoya because he encountered slower cars, while Montoya was marginally pulling away from Coulthard in second. On the 31st lap, Burti retired in the pit lane to avoid an engine failure caused by a water seal problem. Light rain began to fall in the pit lane on lap 35. Four laps later, Montoya was approaching the battling duo of Fisichella and Verstappen. Verstappen pulled to the left on the Reta Oposta straight to allow Montoya to pass, then entered Montoya&#x27;s slipstream to prevent Fisichella from attacking him. Despite both drivers braking sooner than usual, Verstappen hit the rear of Montoya&#x27;s car in the braking area as they entered the Reta Oposto corner. Both drivers were unhurt, however they retired from the race due to the crash. This promoted Coulthard to the lead with Michael Schumacher second, Trulli third and Frentzen fourth.

The rain became more intense, and Coulthard made his only scheduled pit stop of the race on lap 40. His pit stop for fuel and tyres took 9.8 seconds, and he rejoined the track just ahead of Michael Schumacher. Despite Michael Schumacher&#x27;s momentum and warmer tyres, Coulthard maintained the lead on his first lap out of the pit lane. Most drivers on a one-stop strategy intended to schedule their tyre changes when the rain came, but when they needed fuel, they had to switch to dry-compound tyres between laps 41 and 44. Rain began falling harder on lap 45, and most drivers made pit stops for wet-weather tyres, either intermediates or full-wets. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop for intermediate tyres on the following lap, however McLaren did not bring in Coulthard for the entire lap due to uncertainty about the weather, losing 13 seconds to the former. Coulthard made a pit stop for intermediate tyres on lap 47, ceding the lead to Michael Schumacher.

Michael Schumacher lost control of his Ferrari on lap 48 when a rear tyre hit a damp white line on the circuit&#x27;s edge entering turn five. He regained control of his car but avoided stalling to maintain his lead. This driver error allowed Coulthard to close up to Michael Schumacher. Two laps later, coming around the banked last turn and into the Senna S chicane at the end of the straight, Coulthard and Michael Schumacher were about to lap Marques&#x27; slower car, with Coulthard slipstreaming Schumacher. Marques stayed in the middle of the track, allowing Coulthard to move to the inside and Michael Schumacher to the outside. Coulthard passed both drivers to retake the race lead and began to pull away from Michael Schumacher. Drivers on intermediate or full-wet tyres had variable lap times, and it was quite wet on parts of the course, with some areas hit by rain and others by sunshine.

Michael Schumacher lost time to Coulthard when he ran wide into the gravel trap at turn six on lap 53, but he remained in second. Irvine retired after getting his Jaguar trapped on a curb at turn five on the same lap. On lap 56, Mazzacane pulled to the side of the track near the turn one run-off area after his clutch burned out, resulting in a fire that marshals had to extinguish. Räikkönen in ninth lost control of his car after he was caught off guard by the rain, sliding backwards onto the grass and retiring on the following lap. On lap 60, Ralf Schumacher spun at turn five, stalled his car and retired. The fastest drivers managed to avoid Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s stalled car before it was removed from the track. Heidfeld overtook Trulli in turn one for fourth on lap 61. Frentzen, in third, became the race&#x27;s final retirement when he slowed and stopped his car at the side of the track with an electrical misfire two laps later. This promoted Heidfeld to third, Trulli to fourth, Panis to fifth and Alesi to sixth. 

As the track began to dry, Fisichella placed pressure on Alesi, passing him on the outside for sixth place on lap 66. On the following lap, Panis passed Trulli on the inside into turn one. Coulthard slowed down in the final laps but maintained the lead to achieve his first win since the 2000 French Grand Prix and the tenth victory of his career. Michael Schumacher finished second, 16.1 seconds back and the only other driver on the lead lap. Heidfeld finished third for his first career podium and Sauber&#x27;s first since the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, despite a slow pit stop in which a fuel filler got stuck. Panis and Trulli finished fourth and fifth, despite major delays in pit stops for wet-weather tyres. Fisichella ran a reliable race and was the final point-scorer in sixth. Villeneuve was off the pace and finished seventh, followed by Alesi and Marques. Button was the final finisher after a pit stop on lap 28 to rectify an oil leak caused by the scavenge pump failing to evacuate enough oil, reducing engine power. There were 11 classified finishers out of 22 starters, but 10 were running when the race ended.

=== Post-race ===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in the subsequent press conference. Coulthard admitted to being fortunate due to Montoya&#x27;s pace but he believed he and McLaren could still compete in rainy weather. He described ending Ferrari&#x27;s streak of six successive wins as &quot;very important&quot; and expressed satisfaction with winning the Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher stated that he was hoping for a wet track despite the lack of exact estimates about when the rain would arrive, but noted that his car did not work as he had hoped, resulting in driver errors. Heidfeld described his first career podium finish as &quot;incredible for me&quot; and praised Sauber for their efforts, adding, &quot;it&#x27;s really hard for me to realise right now because to be out on the podium, it is amazing.&quot; He added that finishing on the podium was the anomaly in 2001 but he wanted to try to return to the top three as often as possible.

Mercedes-Benz motorsport head Norbert Haug welcomed Coulthard&#x27;s victory as &quot;a turning point&quot; and praised the driver, stating, &quot;He showed what he is really capable of by beating Michael Schumacher in extremely difficult conditions. We have always believed in him but up to now he did not have the best car.&quot; The stewards fined Verstappen $15,000 for colliding with Montoya, which eliminated both drivers from the race. Montoya described the collision as &quot;strange&quot; because he said he braked where he did during the race and assumed Verstappen hit him because he braked too late. Verstappen felt &quot;very sorry&quot; for Montoya after learning he was the race leader but insisted he could not avoid him. He added that he did not purposefully cause the accident and personally apologised to Montoya. Williams technical director Patrick Head argued that Verstappen should have taken sole responsibility for the accident. Arrows later withdrew an appeal of Verstappen&#x27;s fine.

The stewards summoned Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher after their third lap accident, which was their second in two weeks following the Malaysian Grand Prix. They deemed it &quot;a racing incident&quot; and cautioned both drivers over their future conduct. Barrichello argued Ralf Schumacher changed his line after passing another driver and insisted he did not apply the brakes later than usual. Ralf Schumacher accused Barrichello of initiating the collision, adding, &quot;If you drive like that these things come back on you one day.&quot; Three-time world champion Niki Lauda felt Barrichello should have received a two-race ban for his involvement in a recent series of accidents. Brawn defended Barrichello, commenting, &quot;Two people go for a corner, and it takes two people to have an incident. Ralf has been involved in an incident at every race this year – you can be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I gather it was just a racing incident.&quot;

Häkkinen was fined $5,000 for leaving his McLaren on the starting grid without the steering wheel attached. He did not attribute blame for his first lap stall, &quot;I do not want to start making any excuses. The car just wasn&#x27;t able to move because it stalled.&quot; Prost blamed a jammed fuel rig for preventing Alesi from scoring the team&#x27;s first points since September 1999, and the issue was reported to the FIA due to the flammability of Formula One fuel and the associated safety concerns. Fisichella heralded his sixth-place finish as a &quot;perfect&quot; outcome for him and Benetton, something he had not anticipated. Ferrari investigated their performance in the race and found that their vehicles were incorrectly setup and that the car lacked downforce.

Michael Schumacher retained his World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead with 26 points. Coulthard&#x27;s win moved him from third to second, while Barrichello&#x27;s retirement dropped him to third. Heidfeld&#x27;s third-place finish elevated him to fourth while Frentzen dropped to fifth. Ferrari maintained its lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, with 36 points. McLaren drew to within 15 points of Ferrari after Coulthard&#x27;s victory. Sauber overtook Jordan for third while BAR moved to fifth with 14 rounds of the season remaining.

<text>The 2001 San Marino Grand Prix (formally the Gran Premio Warsteiner di San Marino 2001) was a Formula One motor race held before between 80,000 and 100,000 spectators at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, Imola, Emilia-Romagna, Italy on 15 April 2001. It was the fourth race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 21st San Marino Grand Prix. Williams&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher won the 62-lap race, starting from third. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard finished second, and Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello finished third.

Going into the event, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from Coulthard while Ferrari led McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. After setting the fastest lap in the one-hour qualifying session, Coulthard started the race on pole position alongside teammate Mika Häkkinen. Ralf Schumacher from third overtook both McLaren drivers into the Tamburello chicane and retained the lead for the entire race, taking his maiden victory and Williams&#x27;s first since the 1997 Luxembourg Grand Prix; Coulthard ended 4.3 seconds back in second place. Barrichello finished third after switching from a two– to a one–pit stop strategy.

Coulthard&#x27;s second-place finish put him in the joint lead of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Michael Schumacher, but Schumacher retained the lead overall because he had won two races to Coulthard&#x27;s one despite retiring from the race. Barrichello was third, 12 points behind the two, but Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s victory moved him from seventh to fourth. McLaren decreased Ferrari&#x27;s World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead to ten points, while Williams moved from sixth to third with 13 races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2001 San Marino Grand Prix was the race&#x27;s 21st edition, the fourth of seventeen races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship, the season&#x27;s first European round, and one of two in Italy. It was held on 15 April 2001 at the 17-turn, anti-clockwise Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, outside of San Marino which lacks the facilities to host Formula One races. There were eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) with two drivers each for the Grand Prix, with no changes from the season entry list. It was the last race before the legal reintroduction of electronic driver aids at the following in late April.

Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 26 points heading into the race, with McLaren driver David Coulthard second on 20 points. Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari teammate, was third with 10 points, ahead of Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld in fourth with seven points and Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen in fifth with six points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 36 points, 15 ahead of second-placed McLaren. Sauber was third with eight points, followed by Jordan with seven points and British American Racing (BAR) on three points.

Following the on 1 April, almost every team tested their cars, setups, tyres and car components on European racing tracks with their racing driver and test drivers in preparation for the San Marino Grand Prix. BAR, Jordan and McLaren tested for three days in inclement weather at Northamptonshire&#x27;s Silverstone Circuit. Jordan&#x27;s test driver Ricardo Zonta led the first day, while BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve and McLaren&#x27;s test driver Alexander Wurz were fastest on the second and third days. Arrows, Prost, Sauber and Williams tested for three days in variable weather at France&#x27;s Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours. Williams test driver Marc Gené was fastest on the first day, followed by Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi on the second day and Heidfeld on the third. Benetton tested for three days at Spain&#x27;s Circuito de Jerez, with Jaguar joining on the second and third days. Ferrari tested for five days at its private Fiorano Circuit in Italy, with test driver Luca Badoer developing traction control systems in an F1-2000 car for the Spanish Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher tested tyre and aerodynamic developments in an F2001 car for three days for the race in Imola. Arrows collected aerodynamic data from driver Jonny Kane during straight line speed testing at France&#x27;s Lurcy-Lévis track. Minardi did not test since it was awaiting the arrival of equipment from Brazil.

After Michael Schumacher won the first two races in Australia and Malaysia, Coulthard won in Brazil by passing Schumacher in the race, trailing the latter by six championship points and ending his six-race win streak. Coulthard stated he was satisfied with how the first three races went and spoke about his prospects of victory at Imola, &quot;I have won here before and there is no reason why I cannot do so again.&quot; Michael Schumacher, the pre-race bookmakers&#x27; favourite, acknowledged that it was normal to not win every race in a season and said his team could return to form at Imola. Williams won six races at Imola in the 1990s. Driver Juan Pablo Montoya was acquainted with Imola from International Formula 3000 in 1998 and felt his car would be suited to the circuit but not performing as well as in Brazil, adding, &quot;I have only been here once before in my life. It doesn&#x27;t make a great difference, but it does help a little bit.&quot;

Multiple teams updated their cars for the race, while several squads experimented with different brake ducts for improved cooling and installed downforce-reliant aerodynamic packages. After being outpowered by the BMW engine, Ferrari created a more powerful Type 050 V10 engine by increasing its revolutions per minute limit. McLaren made various changes to the MP4-16 to improve its handling when mounting kerbs. It also debuted a redesigned rear wing and a stronger Mercedes V10 engine. BAR modified the 003&#x27;s bodywork to incorporate new wings and narrower side flip-ups in the rear wheel. Arrows fitted a front wing with a wider flap to increase downforce while Jos Verstappen&#x27;s car had a minor suspension modification made of steel rather than carbon fibre due to a lack of time. Sauber did not modify their car nor use Brembo calipers or power steering because they had not been thoroughly tested. Prost modified the front wing&#x27;s endplate flip-ups since they damaged the front tyres when the cars were carried into the garage on full-lock. Minardi lacked a revised aerodynamic package as their cars arrived late from Brazil.

== Practice ==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The first practice session began on a damp, wet track after overnight rain had left parts of the circuit wet, causing spray to be raised off the ground due to the inclement weather. Drivers used wet-weather tyres at first, but lap times improved as the circuit dried swiftly, and they switched to slicks late in practice.

Barrichello recorded the fastest time of 1:31.998, ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen and Coulthard were third and fourth, followed by the Jordan pairing of Jarno Trulli and Frentzen, Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen, BAR&#x27;s Olivier Panis, Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine and Panis&#x27;s teammate Villeneuve in fifth to tenth. Three drivers lost control of their cars at the wet turn 17 during the session. Verstappen was unable to set a lap time when his car stopped, owing to a drop in fuel pressure on his first lap after leaving the pit lane. Minardi&#x27;s Fernando Alonso stopped his car on track with a hydraulic issue that resulted in a gearbox malfunction.

The track had dried sufficiently after the first session, allowing teams to mount slick tyres on their cars for the second session, which provided a more accurate indicator of the pace of drivers. With around 15 minutes to go, Michael Schumacher set the day&#x27;s quickest time of 1:25.095, with his teammate Barrichello second. Williams&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher, Häkkinen, Panis, Räikkönen, Irvine, Villeneuve, Trulli and Jaguar&#x27;s Luciano Burti were in the next eight placings. Coulthard went off the circuit after losing control of his car and becoming stuck in the Acque Minerali corner&#x27;s gravel trap with 13 minutes left in the session due to a gear selection issue. This meant McLaren&#x27;s engineers worked overnight to repair Coulthard&#x27;s car. Montoya suffered an engine problem caused by a piece of gauze dropping into the engine early in the session. He was unable to continue driving as the Williams engineers replaced the engine in his car.

The third practice session on Saturday morning was cold and wet due to overnight rain, resulting in lap times that were around 11 seconds slower than the 2000 pole position lap time. The cooler air caused the track to dry slowly. Michael Schumacher lapped fastest at 1:35.633, followed by his teammate Barrichello. Häkkinen, Coulthard, Trulli, Frentzen, Räikkönen, Heidfeld, Villeneuve, and Montoya rounded out the top ten. Several drivers were taken off guard on the wet track as their cars lost traction. On his second lap of the session, Burti lost control of his car&#x27;s rear entering Tosa corner, severely damaging the front suspension hitting the tyre barrier. Burti exited the car unhurt, although he did not compete in the final session because his mechanics repaired the vehicle before qualifying.

It became sunny for the final session as the circuit gradually dried, and nearly every driver lapped faster than the previous session. Most drivers used wet-weather tyres, and some lost control of their car on the wet circuit. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1:30.737, followed by teammate Barrichello in second. Coulthard, Räikkönen, Frentzen, Heidfeld, Ralf Schumacher, Panis, Arrows&#x27;s Enrique Bernoldi and Häkkinen occupied positions three to ten.

==Qualifying==

Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. The track had dried sufficiently after practice ended but was still damp in some places. There were dark clouds over Imola just before qualifying began, so most drivers, except Coulthard, set lap times early in case it rained. As the course dried, lap times improved as the surface provided more grip to cars. Coulthard adjusted his car&#x27;s setup for his final run after rear-end stability issues and took the 11th pole position of his career with a time of 1:23.054 on his final qualifying lap late on. He broke Villeneuve&#x27;s outright track lap record from 1997 and prevented Michael Schumacher from equalling Ayrton Senna&#x27;s record of eight consecutive poles set between the and seasons. Coulthard was 0.228 seconds faster than teammate Häkkinen in the final runs, setting his time late in qualifying&#x27;s final runs. Ralf Schumacher qualified third, feeling his Michelin tyres were quite competitive. The Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello took fourth and sixth, respectively, after choosing the slower, more durable harder Bridgestone tyre compound over the better-performing softer option because they believed the softer tyres to wear too quickly and expected inclement weather for the race. Michael Schumacher, who adjusted the rear wing settings to increase downforce, lost time through two driver errors, while Barrichello was delayed by slower cars. Trulli took his time and separated the Ferraris, qualifying fifth with a late lap. Montoya, seventh, lost seven-tenths of a second by going wide onto the grass at the Variante Alta chicane on his final run.

Panis was pleased with the improvements to his car and took eighth. Frentzen was hampered on his second run by Tarso Marques&#x27;s Minardi car, and on his third run, his car developed understeer, leaving him ninth. Räikkönen qualified ahead of teammate Heidfeld for the first time in 2001, securing tenth after running across the grass after braking too early for the final turn. Villeneuve in 11th was the fastest driver to not qualify in the top ten due to slower cars on his final run. Heidfeld took 12th after encountering slower vehicles on his penultimate run and losing time on his final run due to understeer and car balance issues. Irvine took 13th since his Jaguar could not adequately load the tyres. Alesi, 14th, drove a car that was sensitive to setup changes and changing track conditions. Burti was the slower Jaguar driver in 15th due to a slow gearbox downshift and a misfiring engine, causing him to go onto the grass at turn three during his final run. Bernoldi and Verstappen qualified 16th and 17th for Arrows, respectively. A technical issue affected Bernoldi&#x27;s third run, and Verstappen&#x27;s last run was in the spare Arrows car due to an engine-related electrical fault. Alonso took 18th after his team switched car settings. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella qualified 19th, and his teammate Jenson Button took 21st. On their last runs, both drivers were plagued by errors, a lack of grip, and slower cars, preventing them from lapping faster. Gastón Mazzacane was 20th for Prost after losing speed in the slower corners and his car&#x27;s performance deteriorated. Marques completed the starting order in 22nd; he failed to find a suitable car setup, and on his final run, a slow front-left puncture developed.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
On the morning of the race, there was a 30-minute warm-up session to finalise car setups and test the teams&#x27; racing strategy. The weather was dry and sunny as teams tested their race and spare cars. Coulthard had surgery to remove an abscess from the left rear that was causing vibrations in his ear the evening before the race. He lapped fastest at 1:26.440, ahead of Ralf Schumacher and Häkkinen, who both understeered into the gravel. Heidfeld and Barrichello were fourth and fifth. Alesi and Mazzacane went off the circuit, while Alonso&#x27;s run was disrupted by mechanical troubles that saw him stop on the side of the track, although he was able to continue driving after returning to the pit lane and switching to the spare car. Räikkönen&#x27;s running was restricted by a broken starting shaft in the backup Sauber car, and his race vehicle had an electrical failure.

==Race==
The race began at 14:00 local time in sunny weather, on a dry circuit, in front of between 80,000 and 100,000 spectators. The air temperature was between , and the track temperature ranged from ; conditions were expected to remain dry for the event. During the start sequence, Coulthard moved slightly before applying the brakes to stop and stabilise his car. Coulthard experienced excess wheelspin in his rear tyres when the race began, as did his teammate Häkkinen on the track&#x27;s dirty side. This allowed Ralf Schumacher to go to the inside after Coulthard gave him space; he avoided contact with Coulthard and passed both McLarens for the lead at the fast left-hand turn on the drive to the Tamburello chicane. Trulli passed the slow-starting Michael Schumacher and then braked later than Häkkinen into the Tamburello chicane to move into third. Panis moved from eighth to fifth, going to the outside on the straight, but Montoya overtook him on the outside at the final Variante Bassa chicane later in the first lap.

When lap one ended, Ralf Schumacher led Coulthard, Trulli, Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher and Montoya. Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard began pulling away from Trulli, who was battling Häkkinen for third, and a pack of cars formed behind them. Heidfeld passed Irvine for 12th, and Verstappen overtook Burti for 16th on lap two. Panis was investigated for a possible jump start but was not penalised. Michael Schumacher appeared to slow exiting the final curve ending lap three after reportedly selecting third gear when mounting the kerbs and his right rear wheel was off the track surface. This confounded the electronic gearbox system, preventing the upshift and keeping him in second gear after leaving the corner. He fell to seventh on the start/finish straight, behind Montoya and Panis, and ran wide at Tosa corner, being passed by teammate Barrichello on the inside. Barrichello went wide on lap five, but Michael Schumacher could not pass him. Verstappen passed Fisichella for 15th on that lap while Marques overtook Mazzacane.

On lap six, while closing on Button, Alonso&#x27;s brakes failed due to a leaking brake caliper. This launched him over the high kerb at the Variante Alta chicane, onto the grass, and damaged his car&#x27;s front-right suspension against the tyre wall at the turn&#x27;s exit. Alonso was unhurt but became the race&#x27;s first retirement. Two laps later, Verstappen stopped at the side of the Rivazza turn with a broken exhaust pipe that caused a series of overheating issues in his car. Panis was slowing Barrichello due to understeer and electronic gear selection issues until the latter passed him on the inside at the Rivazza turn for sixth on the same lap. Michael Schumacher was challenged by Räikkönen on lap nine, but he passed Panis for seventh at the Rivazza turn. Ralf Schumacher extended his lead over Coulthard to four seconds after both drivers traded fastest laps because Michelin&#x27;s tyres generated temperature on the warm circuit faster than Bridgestone&#x27;s tyres. Trulli, who was battling Häkkinen for third, was 20 seconds behind by lap 16.

Räikkönen in ninth was racing Panis when the steering wheel disconnected from the spline cresting the hill on the straight connecting the Tosa hairpin and Piratella turn. On lap 18, his car veered sharply to the left and crashed into the retaining barrier at low speed. Although Räikkönen was unhurt, he was forced to retire. Button made the race&#x27;s first scheduled fuel and tyre pit stop on lap 20. He had to make another pit stop on the following lap when his car received no fuel due to a refuelling rig malfunction. Panis dropped from eighth to 12th on lap 22 after selecting the wrong gear. Michael Schumacher got a puncture on his left front wheel rim due to the brake caliper becoming too hot, resulting in its failure on the following lap. He drove cautiously to the pit lane to ensure that the puncture did not cause any further damage. Schumacher rejoined the track one lap down in 19th and last place. Trulli was the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop on lap 24. Häkkinen was promoted to third, giving him the opportunity to drive without aerodynamic turbulence affecting his McLaren, while Trulli rejoined in eighth. Michael Schumacher completed one exploratory lap before Ferrari summoned him into the pit lane to retire for safety reasons after discovering more problems with his car.

Montoya made his pit stop from fourth on lap 28 and rejoined in seventh, behind Trulli. Coulthard entered the pit lane for the first of two pit stops on the next lap and remained second after establishing a sufficient lead over teammate Häkkinen. Montoya closed up to Trulli on that lap, passing him on the outside at the Tamburello chicane for sixth. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop from the lead on lap 29 and retained an eight-second lead over Coulthard. Häkkinen made his first pit stop soon after, rejoining ahead of Montoya and Trulli but behind Barrichello. An oil leak caused Mazzacane&#x27;s engine to fail and emit flames from the car&#x27;s rear, and he retired on lap 31. Villeneuve was set to score points until he pulled over to the side of the track when oil smoke emitted from his car&#x27;s rear exhaust system on the following lap.

Ferrari moved Barrichello from a two-stop to a one-stop strategy in order to put less fuel in his car and allow him to pass Häkkinen. He made his pit stop on lap 33 and rejoined the track in third, having pulled ahead of Häkkinen. Benetton brought Fisichella into the pit lane to retire with a misfiring engine on the same lap because the team did not want to risk an engine failure. The following fifteen laps saw little action as Ralf Schumacher maintained his lead over Coulthard, but the margin fluctuated due to slower cars, while Coulthard was aware that passing Schumacher would necessitate a better strategy. Barrichello pulled away from the slower Häkkinen but was 26 seconds behind Coulthard by lap 42. Trulli, in sixth, began the second round of pit stops on lap 44, falling behind teammate Frentzen.

Irvine, in ninth, pulled over to the side of the track with smoke streaming from his car&#x27;s air intake box when his engine failed on the same lap. Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher made their second pit stops between laps 45 and 46, remaining second and first, respectively. Häkkinen and Barrichello followed suit over the next two laps. Montoya&#x27;s pit stop on lap 48 was troublesome. The mechanics were unable to remove the refuelling rig from the car&#x27;s rear, and the engine stalled simultaneously. The engine was restarted on the jacks, losing Montoya over a minute on pit lane. He completed one slow lap as he was stuck in first gear after the clutch burned out and retired in the garage. On lap 54, Marques stopped alongside the pit lane barrier, with smoke billowng from his car&#x27;s rear due to an airbox fire, presumably caused by a leaky fuel line. Marshals pushed Marques&#x27;s car off the road and into a secure place, allowing him to depart.

With seven laps remaining, Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s pitboard displayed &quot;Oil Pump&quot; as he slowed, and Coulthard gradually gained on him. Ralf Schumacher led the rest of the race, securing his first win and becoming the first Grand Prix winner&#x27;s brother to win on his own. It was Williams&#x27;s first win since the 1997 Luxembourg Grand Prix. Coulthard finished 4.3 seconds behind in second. Barrichello finished third on the podium, 30 seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen finished fourth despite nose cone damage from a minor first-lap collision with Trulli, which caused his McLaren&#x27;s front end to loosen. Trulli finished fifth, the last driver on the lead lap, while teammate Frentzen had a quiet race to finish sixth and score the final championship point. Heidfeld finished seventh due to car balance issues and lacked the pace to compensate for a poor start. Panis finished eighth after his electrical problem was resolved with a replacement steering wheel during his first pit stop. Alesi on a two-stop strategy lost time following the one-stopping Irvine and was ninth. Bernoldi was tenth, registering his first Grand Prix finish. Burti finished eleventh despite losing the use of the first three gears and having to be circumspect. Button was the final classified finisher, two laps behind Ralf Schumacher. Just 12 of the 22 starters finished the race.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in the subsequent press conference. Ralf Schumacher lauded his car setup and the engine, believing his win might begin a three-way battle for the World Championship. He said of the victory, &quot;It&#x27;s a great experience, and I hope for it to be one of many. I&#x27;ve waited long enough for it, I guess. Since I joined Williams, we&#x27;ve had a lot of work to see that and it paid off today.&quot; Coulthard stated that he was pleased to come second in comparison to other races over the season, adding &quot;it was definitely the most difficult to try to achieve a balance with respect to the tyres, there was quite a big variation&quot; since there was a minor inconsistency with each set of tyres. Barrichello was pleased with his Ferrari&#x27;s balance and admitted to slowing in the final laps because he was trailing Coulthard. Asked if Ferrari&#x27;s tyre selection was the right one, he replied, &quot;At the end of the day we had a good tire for the race, but we may have been slow a little bit in qualifying, and that was probably a mistake.&quot;

Williams&#x27;s victory was popular amongst the paddock. Jaguar team principal and three-time world champion Niki Lauda heralded Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s win as &quot;the perfect race&quot;, adding, &quot;The first Grand Prix win is always the most difficult. The next ones come easier. It will be a big boost for his confidence.&quot; Williams technical director Patrick Head characterised Schumacher&#x27;s form at Imola as &quot;perfect&quot;, stating, &quot;Winning for the first time helps you a lot. What&#x27;s happened will be very good for him.&quot; BMW Motorsport director Gerhard Berger said, &quot;Ralf was strong wasn&#x27;t he? It was a very good race, a really strong and convincing performance.&quot; Willi Weber, the manager of the Schumacher brothers, said Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s victory would help him gain confidence as a driver and that it came at the ideal time given the increased attention his teammate Montoya was receiving.

Häkkinen said his opportunity to win the race ended at the start but was happy to finish fourth: &quot;It is very pleasant to get some points, although unfortunately the overall position was not very good for me. It would have been nice to win, but I am happy.&quot; Trulli called his fifth-place finish &quot;a good result&quot; and that he &quot;was able to show once more that when I have a good car and everything is working well, I can be right there.&quot; Frentzen blamed a slow start for his inability to compete for a better finishing position but said, &quot;Scoring a point for sixth place was some consolation but, to be honest, we need to step up our performance a bit more.&quot; Michael Schumacher stated that the event was disappointing because of his poor start and gear selection issue. Montoya claimed he might have finished on the podium and said that a cockpit warning light informed him of a clutch issue five laps before his second pit stop.

Coulthard&#x27;s second-place finish and podium finishes in the first four races put him in joint first place in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Michael Schumacher with 26 points each; Schumacher had won two races to Coulthard&#x27;s one and so remained first overall. Barrichello retained third with 14 points as Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s victory moved him from seventh to fourth. Heidfeld&#x27;s failure to score dropped him from fourth to fifth. Ferrari maintained its lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 40 points, while McLaren reduced their advantage to ten. With 13 races remaining in the season, Williams moved from sixth to third, Jordan remained fourth, and Sauber dropped from third to fifth.

<text>The 2001 Spanish Grand Prix (officially the XLIII Gran Premio Marlboro de Espana) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 April 2001, at the Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, Catalonia, Spain, before 91,000 spectators. It was the fifth round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship, and the circuit hosted its 11th Spanish Grand Prix. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 65-lap race from pole position. Williams&#x27;s Juan Pablo Montoya finished second for his first Formula One podium finish and British American Racing&#x27;s (BAR) Jacques Villeneuve finished third.

Going into the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher and McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard shared the lead of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, but Ferrari led McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap in the one-hour qualifying session, securing pole position. He held the lead until the two pit stop cycles, when Coulthard&#x27;s teammate Mika Häkkinen took the lead each time round due to his longer stints than Schumacher&#x27;s. Häkkinen took the lead after the second round of stops because McLaren told him to push to get ahead of Schumacher, whose rear tyres began to vibrate. Häkkinen led the race and appeared set to win until his clutch failed on the final lap due to a hydraulic leak. Michael Schumacher took the lead and won by 40 seconds over Montoya.

Electronic driver aids including traction control, fully automatic gearboxes, and launch control became legal for the first time since the season at the Spanish Grand Prix. Schumacher&#x27;s win was his third of the season and his 47th overall. As a result, he led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by eight points over Coulthard and 22 over Rubens Barrichello. With 12 races left in the season, Ferrari expanded their lead in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship to 18 points over McLaren and 32 points over Williams.

==Background==
The 2001 Spanish Grand Prix was the fifth of seventeen Formula One races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship, held on 29 April 2001, at the clockwise Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, Catalonia, Spain, the track&#x27;s 11th Spanish Grand Prix. Before the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher and McLaren driver David Coulthard were tied for the World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead with 26 points each. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was third on 14 points, followed by Williams&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher and Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld with 12 and 7 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 40 points, and McLaren were second with 30. Williams were third with 12 points, followed by Jordan on 10 and Sauber on 8.

Two months before the start of the Grand Prix weekend, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) and all the teams agreed to legalise electronic driver aids such as traction control, fully-automatic gearboxes, and launch control from the Spanish Grand Prix to end long-standing rumours of cheating by teams in Formula One, because of the extreme difficulty of policing such systems and to clarify which electronic systems were legal. The FIA previously prohibited these devices at the end of , fearing that technology would reduce driver abilities. Several drivers voiced displeasure with the systems&#x27; return, but engineers and manufacturers observed that it provided an opportunity for them to demonstrate their technical skills. Drivers tried the new technology as they left the pit lane during free practice.

Following the San Marino Grand Prix on 15 April, all teams tested aerodynamics, electronic driver aids, engines, mechanical car components and tyres at various European racing circuits to prepare for the Spanish Grand Prix. The British-based teams of Benetton, British American Racing (BAR), Jaguar, Jordan, McLaren and Williams and the Paris-based Prost team tested at England&#x27;s Silverstone Circuit from 17 to 19 April. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen set the first day&#x27;s fastest lap time, while McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen led on the final two days. Sauber, Ferrari and Minardi tested at Italy&#x27;s Mugello Circuit between 18 and 20 April. Luca Badoer, Ferrari&#x27;s test driver, topped the first day&#x27;s running, while Michael Schumacher led the second and final days. Arrows did two days of private straight-line speed aerodynamic testing at Italy&#x27;s Vairiano Circuit with former Indy Lights driver Jonny Kane, followed by regular driver Jos Verstappen. Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen joined them. Badoer and Barrichello tested several Ferraris for the race at the team&#x27;s private testing facility, the Fiorano Circuit.

Häkkinen had scored four points in the season&#x27;s first four races. He hoped to extend his winning streak in Spain to four successive victories, adding, &quot;No one is too far ahead and there are still plenty of points to be scored. I hope my championship starts here.&quot; His teammate Coulthard said he would be prepared for the race, but was aware of Häkkinen&#x27;s performance at the circuit and that a victory for the latter would return him to championship contention. Following two subpar races, Michael Schumacher stated that he was not concerned after retiring from the San Marino Grand Prix, but believed Ferrari might regain competitiveness and win in Spain. Williams&#x27;s Juan Pablo Montoya anticipated a difficult Grand Prix due to his car&#x27;s pace in recent circuit tests, saying, &quot;I am sure when we get there we will figure it out and hopefully be competitive. It will be quite interesting. For me I am really looking forward to getting to the end of a race to score some points.&quot; 
The event featured eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) with two drivers each, with two changes from the season entry list. Luciano Burti, who had driven for Jaguar from the beginning of the season, was released and replaced by Pedro de la Rosa, the team&#x27;s test driver. Burti joined Prost as the second driver change, replacing Gastón Mazzacane, who was sacked by Prost for breaching a performance clause in his contract after being off teammate Jean Alesi&#x27;s pace. Prost attempted to replace Mazzacane with Jordan test driver Ricardo Zonta, among others, but they declined to join a smaller team. Benetton&#x27;s Jenson Button had been nursing a shoulder injury for more than a month but entered the race after visiting specialists.

Some teams did not use some electronic driver aids in their cars because of reliability issues, and there was less emphasis on cooling the brakes. Teams disputed the legality of the Williams FW23&#x27;s diffuser after learning of it, but FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer declared it legal. Ferrari employed temperature sensors inside the F2001&#x27;s wheels to monitor their temperatures and the identical front wing as at the San Marino Grand Prix. McLaren used smaller and cleaner front brake ducts to cool the disc and caliper during qualifying and the race. Sauber&#x27;s C20 cars remained without power steering because it was deemed too unreliable during testing. BAR tried upward-exiting exhausts on both Olivier Panis and Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s 003 cars, as well as a triangular fin behind the front wheels and small gurney flaps on the front wing. Jaguar again installed a revised front wing as seen at Imola. Arrows&#x27;s spare car included a new front suspension, various steering locations for improved geometry and weight reduction, and redesigned front wing endplates with horizontal flip-up winglets. Benetton, Minardi, Prost and Williams made no external changes to their cars.

==Practice==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The quickest lap times were recorded early in both Friday sessions&#x27; one-hour periods, and the abrasive track surface resulted in heavy tyre wear. The first practice session was held in the morning, in dry and sunny weather following early morning rain. Drivers reported low grip and oversteer, so teams adjusted their traction control systems. 

Coulthard led the opening session with a lap of 1:20.107, half a second faster than Barrichello. Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Häkkinen and Panis, Montoya, Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, his teammate Frentzen and Heidfeld completed the top ten. Montoya spun his car entering turn seven after locking his front-left wheel. Frentzen lost control of his vehicle&#x27;s rear, skidded into the turn seven gravel trap and collided with the tyre barrier. Villeneuve pulled over to the side of the pit lane exit, with flames erupting from his car after an engine failure, probably caused by an electronic driver aid, while performing a standing start with ten minutes remaining. Engine components penetrated Villeneuve&#x27;s undertray and punctured the tarmac. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine missed most of the session with two hydraulic gearbox leaks.

The weather remained sunny and dry for the second practice session later in the afternoon. Coulthard went quicker than in the previous session and led with a time of 1:20.107, ahead of Irvine, Barrichello, Panis, Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen, who were within a second of Coulthard&#x27;s time, De La Rosa, Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve and Trulli. Minardi&#x27;s Tarso Marques locked his brakes and spun into the gravel 20 minutes in. Montoya stopped at the side of the circuit at turn four when his engine failed for unknown reasons. Häkkinen nearly understeered in turn ten early in the session, spun late on the uphill turn 11, and continued driving.

The third practice session to setup cars for qualifying took place on Saturday morning in sunny and cool weather. Michael Schumacher was the fastest in the third practice session, at 1:18.634; Häkkinen was second, despite locking his tyres and running off into turn one&#x27;s gravel trap before returning to the race track en route to the pit lane late in the session. Coulthard, Barrichello, Trulli, Frentzen, Heidfeld, Räikkönen, Ralf Schumacher and Panis followed in positions three to ten. 

Michael Schumacher failed to lap quicker in the final session later in the morning, but stayed fastest overall, four hundredths of a second ahead of teammate Barrichello in second. Coulthard, Räikkönen, Heidfeld, Trulli, Panis, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve rounded out the top ten. After ten minutes, De La Rosa was on the pit lane straight with the speed limiter on when his Jaguar unexpectedly veered to the right and into the barrier at the pit lane exit owing to a power steering failure, removing the front-right wheel. De La Rosa&#x27;s car was stranded, but he was unhurt in the accident.

==Qualifying==

Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. It was sunny but breezy for qualifying, and with softer tyre compounds and traction control, the quickest lap was six seconds faster than Häkkinen&#x27;s pole position time in 2000. Michael Schumacher increased downforce in his Ferrari and completed eight of his twelve laps on three sets of soft compound tyres. He secured his fourth pole position in five races of the 2001 season and the 36th of his career with a lap of 1:18.201, a new track lap record set with 15 minutes left on his third set of tyres. Häkkinen turned off traction control to limit understeer, and his quickest lap late in qualifying was 0.085 seconds slower for second. Coulthard took third after being demoted from second by teammate Häkkinen. He could not lap quicker owing to car balance concerns and Heidfeld bulking his final run. Barrichello qualified fourth, setting the same time as in Saturday morning practice. He battled both McLaren drivers for position late in the session. Ralf Schumacher was the highest-placed Michelin-shod entrant in fifth. Jordan&#x27;s drivers Trulli and Frentzen took sixth and eighth, respectively, on the soft Bridgestone tyre compounds. Trulli had slower cars on his quickest lap while Frentzen improved with each lap despite losing time in the final sector. Villeneuve, seventh, spun into the gravel trap at the end of the pit lane straight due to disconnected rear brakes. He was sent out with his car overweight due to ballast that should have been removed for a run with low fuel, and had a slight brake issue during qualifying. The Sauber cars of Räikkönen and Heidfeld were ninth and tenth. Räikkönen regretted not changing his car&#x27;s setup from practice, but Heidfeld drove the spare C20 car, which had been setup to suit him instead of his teammate due to a driveshaft problem with his race car while on an installation lap for his opening run.

Panis in 11th was slowed by De La Rosa and Barrichello on two separate laps. The presence of other cars around him prevented him from setting another fast lap. Montoya, 12th, lost time after Verstappen spun ahead of him and was hampered by other cars. Irvine slipstreamed pole sitter Michael Schumacher down the pit lane straight, allowing him to go faster to qualify 13th. Burti, in his first Formula One qualifying session for Prost, was 14th after the wind hampered his car&#x27;s balance, making it difficult to record a quick lap. Alesi, his teammate, struggled to find balance and pace in his car, qualifying 15th. Arrows teammates Enrique Bernoldi and Verstappen secured 16th and 17th for the third consecutive race. Bernoldi made no significant alterations to his car&#x27;s setup and he experienced a minor loss of control. Verstappen spun into the turn four gravel trap on his third run due to a lengthy brake pedal, causing undertray damage. Fernando Alonso was the fastest Minardi driver in 18th place after having his engine replaced due to an oil system issue in morning practice. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella took 19th when slow cars hampered his final runs. De La Rosa qualified 20th due to rear brake issues on his final run in the spare Jaguar R2 set up for teammate Irvine while his race car was being repaired following his fourth practice session crash. Button continued to nurse his shoulder injury, and took 21st as the slower Benetton driver because late-qualifying car setup alterations took longer than expected, and he missed the final run. Marques completed the starting order in 22nd. He could not find a proper chassis balance because of excess oversteer in some turns and he lost a lot of time approaching a slower car on his final run, in which he almost spun.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
A 30-minute warm-up session was held in warm, breezy conditions on race morning. Most drivers practiced their launch control systems with a standing start. Both Ferrari cars maintained their good pace from qualifying; Barrichello set the fastest time of 1:20.680 on his second run. Michael Schumacher was fourth in the other Ferrari car; Häkkinen and teammate Coulthard were second and third, respectively. Frentzen and Panis completed the top six fastest drivers with identical lap times. With two minutes remaining, Coulthard&#x27;s engine failed because of a hydraulics failure, resulting in a full shutdown of his McLaren&#x27;s essential systems exiting the final turn. He moved off the racing line and stopped at the side of the track after the pit lane.

==Race==
The Grand Prix commenced before 91,000 spectators at 14:00 local time in the afternoon, in cool, cloudy and overcast weather conditions. The air temperature ranged from , and the track temperature was between . Michael Schumacher and both McLaren drivers had new sets of tyres for the race, but two stops gave Schumacher a one-second advantage for two laps after exiting the pit lane. Fisichella drove the spare Benetton car for the race. As the field began the formation lap, Coulthard was left on the starting grid due to an electronic launch control glitch as he began the start sequence. He raised his hand to signal he could not start, and a marshal waved a yellow flag behind his car. The mechanics restarted his engine, but he had to start at 22nd and last because the entire field had passed him. Michael Schumacher moved to the inside to prevent Häkkinen from passing him into turn one. Frentzen was temporarily stranded on the grid after turning off his launch control system, dropping from eighth to 22nd as cars swerved to avoid hitting him and caused congestion. 

Fisichella hit Coulthard from behind, breaking the latter&#x27;s front wing, two floor stays, and the mounting point for the rear jack. Coulthard then hit Bernoldi&#x27;s rear end, and his front wing folded under the McLaren. He drove slowly to the pit lane for a replacement front wing, which took 15.4 seconds, while Bernoldi also made a pit stop for repairs. Coulthard also suffered a severe cut tyre in the accident, which was replaced once his race engineer Pat Fry noticed it. Montoya on the track&#x27;s middle moved from 11th to sixth by the end of the main straight after the Sauber teammates avoided crashing, while Barrichello fell behind Ralf Schumacher and Trulli. Barrichello overtook Ralf Schumacher and Trulli on the outside at turn two to reclaim third. After the first lap, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Trulli, and Montoya. 

Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen gradually began to pull away from Barrichello, with Schumacher setting successive fastest laps and Häkkinen increasing his pace to stay close behind him. Panis overtook Räikkönen for 10th on lap three as Alonso fell to 16th after being passed by de la Rosa and Frentzen due to a driver error. On the next lap, Panis tried unsuccessfully to pass Irvine on the outside for ninth at turn one, On lap six, Frentzen attempted to overtake De La Rosa on the outside at turn ten for 16th, but he lost control of his car&#x27;s rear on a kerb and understeered. Frentzen&#x27;s rear wheels flew backwards over De La Rosa&#x27;s front wing. Both drivers retired from the race in the gravel trap off the circuit. Bernoldi joined the list of retirees when he pulled off onto the grassy side at turn five on lap nine due to a loss of fuel pressure. Coulthard caught and overtook Marques for 18th on lap 13 and Button for 17th three laps later. The first scheduled pit stops began on lap 17. Coulthard passed Fisichella for 15th on lap 18, as Montoya closed up to Trulli in fifth and began battling him.

Ralf Schumacher in fourth lost control of his car when braking and downshifting for La Caixa turn on lap 21 owing to the rear brakes locking. He spun off into the gravel trap and retired. This moved Trulli to fourth and Montoya to fifth, before both drivers made their first pit stops on the next lap. Swift work from Montoya&#x27;s crew put him ahead of Trulli. Michael Schumacher made his first pit stop on lap 23. His pit stop took 8.7 seconds, and he returned to the circuit in third. Häkkinen now led, with Barrichello in second. Häkkinen drove stints around three laps longer than Michael Schumacher, resulting in more fuel in his car. He began to push hard, but Schumacher&#x27;s speed on new tyres and a full tank of fuel allowed him to negate his weight advantage. Panis&#x27;s pit stop on lap 25 was difficult since he stalled due to an electronic issue before exiting the pit lane after a brief delay. 

Barrichello made his first stop from second on the same lap and rejoined in third, behind teammate Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen made his first pit stop on the 27th lap. His pit stop was slower than Michael Schumacher&#x27;s and the latter retook the lead on the pit lane straight as Häkkinen exited the pit lane in second. Coulthard moved up the field through McLaren&#x27;s tactics. He entered the pit lane from eighth on lap 28 and rejoined in 11th. Following the first round of pit stops, Michael Schumacher continued to lead from Häkkinen, Barrichello, Montoya, Villeneuve and Trulli. The race resembled a procession for the next 12 laps as Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen&#x27;s margin varied while they lapped slower cars. Montoya made a driver error at turn ten on lap 37, but instead of retiring, he chose to slow down slightly. 

The second round of pit stops began on lap 39. Trulli made a pit stop on lap 40, dropping from sixth to tenth. On the following lap, Montoya and Villeneuve made their second pit stops simultaneously, and Montoya went ahead, with Villeneuve trailing Coulthard. On lap 43, Michael Schumacher entered the pit lane for his second planned pit stop, leading Häkkinen by 4.2 seconds. His stop took 9.3 seconds, rejoining with no other car around him in third with enough fuel to finish the race. Michael Schumacher was unable to duplicate his earlier performance due to a vibration from his Ferrari&#x27;s rear tyres shifting on the rims, resulting in poor balance. This kept him from pushing hard, and Ferrari suspected tyre delamination, so they advised him to slow to avoid having to make a third pit stop. Barrichello&#x27;s second pit stop came on lap 45 and he maintained third. Two laps later, Häkkinen&#x27;s pit board displayed a message about the gap between himself and Michael Schumacher, as well as an instruction to push in order to open up a big enough gap with a series of fast laps to pass the latter following his second pit stop. 

On lap 49, a right-rear suspension fault caused Barrichello to lose control of his car and run into the turn seven gravel trap. He entered the pit lane for a new set of tyres and fell to seventh before returning to the pit lane to retire with a damaged suspension on his Ferrari the following lap. This promoted Montoya to third and Villeneuve to fourth. On lap 50, Irvine pulled off to the side of the circuit on the pit lane straight after losing engine oil pressure. Häkkinen had a 26-second lead when he made his second pit stop on the next lap. He exited the pit lane in the lead, 3.5 seconds ahead of Michael Schumacher, who lost 4.8 seconds over seven laps due to car vibrations and slower cars. Button passed Marques for 15th and last on lap 52. Nine laps later, Coulthard slipstreamed Button&#x27;s car, which he and Heidfeld were lapping for extra speed, and withstood Heidfeld&#x27;s outside defence to move into sixth on the main straight entering turn one.

In the final laps, Häkkinen extended his advantage over Michael Schumacher to 42 seconds as Schumacher slowed to try to finish second, and it appeared that the latter would win the race for the fourth consecutive year. However, just as Häkkinen began the last lap, his clutch failed unexpectedly on the start/finish straight due to a hydraulic leak. He had to drive slowly around the track before pulling off at the exit of turn seven, with smoke pouring and metal debris from his McLaren&#x27;s rear Michael Schumacher was thus promoted into the lead, which he maintained to claim his third victory of the season and 47th overall. Montoya had his first Formula One race finish and maiden career podium in second. On strategy, Villeneuve finished third, securing BAR&#x27;s first podium since the team&#x27;s debut in and his first since the 1998 Hungarian Grand Prix. Although he had brake and gearbox troubles, Trulli finished fourth. He was less than half a second ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Heidfeld completed the points scorers in sixth. Panis&#x27;s stall at his first pit stop left him seventh. An understeer meant Räikkönen was eighth. Despite not finishing the race, Häkkinen was classified ninth. Alesi and Burti, the two-stopping Prost duo (with underpower steering), finished 10th and 11th. Verstappen finished 12th despite having to push harder to extract car performance due to front-end issues after his first pit stop. The Minardi pair of Alonso in 13th and Marques in 16th raced difficult-to-handle cars due to track conditions, while Marques experienced severe understeer that worsened throughout the race. They were separated by Benetton teammates Button and Fisichella in 14th and 15th.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher told Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn &quot;we have been bloody lucky, But you have to finish and we did it, so good job.&quot; Although Schumacher was pleased with his race performance, he expressed sympathy over Häkkinen&#x27;s retirement, saying, &quot;I simply said sorry and I wanted to apologise. It belongs to him to be sitting here, he hasn&#x27;t made any mistakes and sometimes racing is hard but to some degree that&#x27;s the way racing is. It&#x27;s a shame for him it happened so short before the end, if it happens sometimes 20 laps in the race it&#x27;s less hard to take but this way must be very shocking for him&quot;. Montoya felt it &quot;really exciting&quot; to get his first podium result and he did not expect to finish on the podium, &quot;The start was really good and moved me up a lot of places and then I just kept pushing all day long.&quot; Villeneuve thought his third place finish as &quot;the boost that everyone was needing&quot; given the amount of effort BAR had done over the previous three years. He added that the team could not go any quicker since his car was difficult to drive.

After the race, Coulthard stopped at Häkkinen&#x27;s car and gave him a lift back to the closed parc fermé in the pit lane on his sidepod. It was the first time a driver had lost a race victory after retiring on the final lap since Nigel Mansell in the 1991 Canadian Grand Prix. Häkkinen admitted to being &quot;super disappointed&quot; over his last lap retirement, &quot;goddamn it, you know – Jesus. It could have been a fantastic finish for me – it was going so easy. I didn&#x27;t even have to push. I was just more or less cruising but it just didn&#x27;t work out this time for me.&quot; He added, &quot;I thought about it. I thought &#x27;Wow, I&#x27;m going to win for the fourth time in Barcelona. If that happens it&#x27;s incredible. Then on the last lap I said &#x27;Okay, now I understand, it can&#x27;t be this good to be true. Sometimes things just don&#x27;t go like you want them to go.&quot;

McLaren team principal Ron Dennis told British television station ITV that Coulthard&#x27;s stall before the formation lap was due to &quot;a bit of brain fade.&quot; When Coulthard was informed about the comment, his response was &quot;I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Ron has had a bit of brain-fade to make that comment without talking to me or the engineers first.&quot; Coulthard reportedly confronted Dennis about his remark in the garage. Following further deliberations, Dennis later withdrew his comment about Coulthard after McLaren&#x27;s final review of the telemetry determined that a software glitch caused Coulthard&#x27;s stall. Former driver John Watson said Dennis&#x27;s comments &quot;was both an unprofessional and stupid thing&quot; and that he should have located the problem and given his comment some proper thought. Coulthard later stated that there was no need to remedy the issue because it was resolved shortly after the race, and his launch control system software was modified to prevent him from stalling again.

Brawn said Ferrari strategy and his calculations may have allowed Michael Schumacher to win the race if the driver had not been hindered by tyre vibrations after his second pit stop, saying, &quot;It would have been very close.&quot; Trulli dedicated his fourth-place finish to fellow Italian Michele Alboreto who died in a sports car accident at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz in Germany in the week of the Grand Prix. Barrichello stated that he was confident he would have finished on the podium if he had not retired due to a rear suspension issue. De La Rosa and Frentzen had different perspectives on their collision. De La Rosa stated that he attempted to provide space but had little room to manoeuvre. Frentzen, however, blamed De La Rosa for not looking to his side, claiming that he had passed him when the accident happened.

Michael Schumacher retook the lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 36 points after the race. Coulthard was second with 28 points, 14 ahead of third-placed Barrichello and 16 ahead of fourth-placed Ralf Schumacher. Heidfeld maintained fifth with eight points. Ferrari extended their World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead with 50 points. McLaren remained second with 32 points, while Williams held third with 18 points. Jordan (13 points) and Sauber (9 points) remained fourth and fifth respectively with 12 races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2001 Austrian Grand Prix (officially the Grosser A1 Preis von Österreich 2001) was a Formula One motor race held before 76,000 spectators at the A1-Ring in Spielberg, Styria, Austria on 13 May 2001. It was the sixth round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 24th Austrian Grand Prix as part of the series. David Coulthard driving for the McLaren team won the 71-lap race starting from seventh. Michael Schumacher of the Ferrari team finished second, with his teammate Rubens Barrichello third.

Going into the Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from Coulthard as his team Ferrari led McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Michael Schumacher won the 37th pole position of his career by setting the fastest lap time in qualifying. The Williams pair of Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher overtook him at the start of the event. Montoya led the first 15 laps until Michael Schumacher attempted a pass on Montoya that put both drivers wide on lap 16. Montoya relinquished the lead to Barrichello, who held it until a pit stop on the 46th lap. Coulthard took the lead by staying on the circuit three laps longer than Barrichello. He maintained it for the rest of the race to win. Michael Schumacher finished second after Barrichello complied with team orders from Ferrari to cede the position on the final lap.

It was Coulthard&#x27;s second victory of the season and the eleventh of his career. Due to the result of the race, Coulthard was left within four points of the leader of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship Michael Schumacher. Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher maintained third and fourth. Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld kept fifth. Ferrari continued to lead McLaren by 18 points in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship and Williams maintained third – both Montoya and Ralf Schumacher failed to finish due to mechanical problems – with eleven races left in the season.

==Background==

The 2001 Austrian Grand Prix was the 6th of the 17 motor races of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 24th edition of the event as part of the series. It was held at the nine-turn A1 Ring, Spielberg, Styria on 13 May 2001. Redesigned by Hermann Tilke to comply with FIA Grade 1 Circuit License requirements for its Formula One return in 1997, the track is of average length and provides very few low-speed sections. It allowed teams to optimise their engines and ran with little downforce. Teams also ensured that brakes and cooling systems had no excess strain put upon them because of their heavy usage over a single lap. For the Grand Prix, 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) entered two race drivers each.

Following the 2000 race, the Grand Prix organisers extended the length of the kerbs along the side of the track and the gravel traps beside it. An additional row of tyres was erected to improve driver safety. The line demoting the entry to the pit lane was moved from the entry to the final corner to the exit of turn eight. The changes were predicted to affect lap times since cars would have less on-track time and spend more time in their pit stalls.

After winning the preceding Spanish Grand Prix, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 36 points, eight ahead of David Coulthard in the leading McLaren in second. The second Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello was third with 14 points and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher was two points behind in fourth. With eight points, Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld completed the top five in the standings. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with 50 points; McLaren stood in second place with 32 points. Williams were third with 18 points, as Jordan with 13 points and Sauber nine contended for fourth place.

In preparation for the race, all the teams conducted in-season test sessions at various circuits across Europe. Jaguar, Prost, Benetton, Williams and McLaren went to the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia from 1 to 3 May. Teams undertook tyre development on behalf of Michelin and Bridgestone, tested their aerodynamic packages; McLaren and Benetton developed the chassis of their MP4/16 and B201 cars. Jordan, Sauber, British American Racing (BAR) and Arrows tested at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone from 1 to 3 May, which was disrupted on the first day when Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s Sauber was caught off guard by Jordan test driver Ricardo Zonta at the exit to Becketts corner. Sauber assessed launch control for the first time. Minardi tested launch control and a revised electronics package at the Fiorano Circuit in Italy with driver Fernando Alonso, joining Ferrari who utilised the track for car development and reliability testing.

At the previous round in Spain, Coulthard stalled on the starting grid and McLaren team principal Ron Dennis accused him of &quot;brain fade&quot;, a remark he later retracted. While Dennis publicly apologised to Coulthard, the relationship between the two was still strained; Coulthard spoke of his hope of continuing to score points in every race of the season. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; columnist Sarah Edworthy said the Austrian Grand Prix was where Coulthard had to demonstrate no driver errors. His manager Martin Brundle stated Coulthard needed to prevent emotions from disrupting his consistency. Michael Schumacher said his focus was to respond to McLaren&#x27;s challenge and hoped to be competitive in Austria, &quot;Last year I got pushed out of the race at the first corner which was very disappointing. This year I hope things will go better for me. The car should be competitive, the track characteristics are similar to those of the last race in terms of performance.&quot;

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted an hour; the third and fourth sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. The Friday practice sessions took place in dry and overcast weather and on a slippery, dusty track. Several drivers spun during the session; all avoided damage to their cars. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen, unwell with the flu, set the first practice session&#x27;s fastest lap of 1 minute and 11.751 seconds late on, almost three-tenths of a second faster than his teammate Coulthard in second. Barrichello, Räikkönen, Ralf Schumacher, Michael Schumacher, Arrows driver Enrique Bernoldi, BAR&#x27;s Olivier Panis, the second Arrows of Jos Verstappen and Heidfeld rounded out the session&#x27;s top ten quickest drivers. Jean Alesi&#x27;s Prost had an engine failure on the start/finish straight, and Jordan driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen had his running curtailed with a power steering problem.

In the second practice session, Coulthard recorded the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1 minute and 11.245 seconds on his final lap of practice. His teammate Häkkinen placed second and Barrichello was the highest-placed Ferrari in third, having been the fastest driver late in the session until both of the McLaren vehicles set their quickest laps. Ralf Schumacher, Michael Schumacher, Heidfeld, Frentzen, Räikkönen and the BAR duo of Panis and Jacques Villeneuve followed in positions four through ten. Jenson Button&#x27;s Benetton B201 engine failed on the approach to turn two five minutes into practice. Verstappen later spun into the final turn gravel trap and his Arrows teammate Bernoldi lost control of his car returning to the pit lane.

The Saturday morning practice sessions occurred in clear and warm weather. With a time of 1 minute and 10.094 seconds, Michael Schumacher was fastest in the third practice session, ahead of Williams&#x27; Juan Pablo Montoya, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Coulthard, Frentzen, Panis, Villeneuve and the Sauber duo of Räikkönen and Heidfeld. Bernoldi ran into the grass by locking his brakes, and Coulthard approached the final corner too quickly, causing him to drive deep into the corner&#x27;s gravel trap.

Coulthard led the final practice session with a lap of 1 minute and 10.010 seconds. The Ferrari cars were second and third – Michael Schumacher ahead of Barrichello – with Schumacher leading the time sheets until Coulthard&#x27;s last lap. Häkkinen, Montoya, his teammate Ralf Schumacher, Frentzen, Jarno Trulli, Heidfeld and Villeneuve completed the top ten. Verstappen&#x27;s right-rear suspension failed at the double left Niki Lauda bend turn, spearing into a gravel trap and a wall beside the track. Ralf Schumacher spun through 180 degrees at the turn two; he continued driving. Later, a deer emerged from the forests and caused Montoya to slow. The deer ran through a gravel trap and left the circuit via a trackside barrier.

==Qualifying ==
Saturday afternoon&#x27;s one hour qualifying session saw each driver limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by their fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107 per cent of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race. The weather was warm and overcast with a headwind slowing drivers. As the circuit was low on grip due to a lack of usage, drivers waited for 21 minutes before driving on it, leading to heavy traffic. Notwithstanding a driver error at turn two, Michael Schumacher bettered Häkkinen&#x27;s unofficial lap record from the 2000 race to take his fifth pole position of the season and the 37th of his career with a lap of 1 minute and 9.562 seconds. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Montoya who took his maiden front row start. Traffic on his final timed lap, an error on his third, and a slower pace in the final two corners put Ralf Schumacher third. Barrichello in fourth adjusted his car&#x27;s downforce set-up. Trulli changed his engine after it failed during practice and he drove the final 15 minutes to take fifth. Sixth-placed Heidfeld made minor alterations to his Sauber C20 and experimented with tyre pressures. The McLaren team were seventh and eighth in its worst qualifying performance since the 1997 French Grand Prix. Coulthard in seventh could not improve his lap because of the headwind and a car balance that created oversteer. A minor loss of water pressure in his engine at turn three and on the back straight slowed his teammate Häkkinen in eighth on his final attempt.

Ninth-placed Räikkönen was slowed by Villeneuve on a timed lap and had a recurrence of gearbox shifting problems from the prior two practice sessions. Panis took tenth after confusion over tyre strategy. Frentzen in 11th accidentally engaged his pit lane limiter at his first attempt and his best lap was on his second timed run before his car&#x27;s balance deteriorated. Multiple errors from an unbalanced setup and weight distribution on his BAR 003 restricted Villeneuve to 12th. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine swerved into the pit lane to avoid hitting Alesi&#x27;s spun car on his first timed lap and traffic left him in 13th. His teammate Pedro de la Rosa took 14th on his second lap. Bernoldi in 15th was ahead of his teammate Verstappen 16th after a spin at the final corner, which caused Michael Schumacher to swerve into a gravel trap. Burti and Alesi qualified their Prost cars in 17th and 20th, both complaining of a lack of car grip. Alonso separated the two drivers in 18th. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella in 19th had a misfiring engine and he used the spare car setup for his teammate Button. Car set-up issues and an understeer left Button in 21st. Tarso Marques in the second Minardi car was the final qualifier in 22nd; he spun into a gravel trap and took the team&#x27;s spare car until a rear damper fault curtailed his running.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a 30-minute warm-up session in dry weather. All drivers fine-tuned their race set-ups against the weather of the time, set laps in their spare cars and Jaguar and Williams tested their launch control systems. Both McLaren drivers improved from qualifying: Häkkinen recorded a lap of 1 minute and 11.647 seconds to go fastest. Coulthard and Frentzen were second and third and the Ferrari pair of Barrichello and Michael Schumacher fourth and fifth, the latter stopped at the exit of the pit lane with fire erupting from the rear of his car. Positions six through ten were occupied by Trulli, Räikkönen, Villeneuve, de la Rosa and Heidfeld. An engine problem prompted Villeneuve to switch into the spare BAR 003 car for the race.

==Race==
The 71-lap race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00) before 76,000 spectators. It ran for 71 laps over a distance of . The weather at the start was dry and clear, with the air temperature from and the track temperature between ; forecasts four days beforehand predicted rain showers and lower ambient and track temperatures. At the start, both Jordan cars of Frentzen, Trulli, Häkkinen&#x27;s McLaren and Heidfeld&#x27;s Sauber were stationary on the grid with launch control system faults. That prompted several drivers to swerve to prevent a pile-up. In the meantime, Montoya moved ahead of the slow starting Michael Schumacher for the lead since the starting grid provided more grip than the pit lane exit on which Schumacher&#x27;s launch control system had been tuned. Ralf Schumacher then got past the Ferrari driver to move into second on the approach to turn one. Coulthard made a fast getaway, moving from seventh to fifth after Michael Schumacher held him off into first turn. At the first lap&#x27;s conclusion, the safety car was deployed since track marshals were unable to clear the grid of stranded cars in time for all of the circulating drivers to come by at racing speed. Of the stalled cars, Frentzen retired with a broken gearbox, Häkkinen did a solitary exploratory lap once the safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap three before retiring and Trulli and Heidfeld began from the pit lane. Some mechanics had attempted to illegally restart the stalled cars in the pit lane&#x27;s fast lane. 

Montoya maintained the lead over his teammate Ralf Schumacher in second and Michael Schumacher in third after the safety car drove into the pit lane at lap three&#x27;s conclusion. On lap four, Verstappen overtook Räikkönen and Irvine to move to sixth as he set an early fastest lap of 1 minute and 14.059 seconds because he was on a light fuel load. That same lap, Fisichella joined the list of retirees by his race engineer instructing him over the radio to enter the pit lane with a misfiring engine. Verstappen then bettered his own fastest lap to a 1-minute and 13.282 seconds on the following lap as he passed Coulthard for fifth. During the fifth lap, Trulli went into final corner&#x27;s gravel trap, and Heidfeld overtook him for 18th. An attempt by Barrichello to pass his teammate Michael Schumacher on lap six almost resulted in contact at the second turn. That allowed Verstappen to challenge Barrichello; he could not overtake him. On lap seven, Panis passed Irvine for seventh and stopped a counterattack from the latter.

Two laps later, Ralf Schumacher began to lose pressure in his rear brakes and fell back from his teammate Montoya; he struggled against Michael Schumacher and Barrichello. Bernoldi passed Irvine and Villeneuve on the same lap. On lap 10, Villeneuve lined up a pass on Irvine for 10th and the two made contact halfway through the first corner, causing Villeneuve to spin and relinquish 11th place to de la Rosa. Ralf Schumacher fell to seventh before he entered the pit lane at the end of the lap to retire. This promoted Michael Schumacher into second, his teammate Barrichello third and Verstappen fourth. At this point, a higher rate of tyre degradation of his Michelin compounds slowed Montoya, allowing Michael Schumacher to close up and forming a group of cars composed of Schumacher, Barrichello, Verstappen, Coulthard and Räikkönen.

Over the next four laps, Montoya held off attempts from Michael Schumacher to overtake. On the 14th lap, Trulli was shown a black flag to inform him he had been disqualified from the race because he ignored the red light to indicate that the pit lane was closed and going into the queue behind the safety car. The top six drivers were covered by two seconds at the start of lap 16. As the field drove towards turn two, Michael Schumacher drew alongside Montoya on the right going into the turn and then steered left for the corner itself, putting Montoya on the track&#x27;s centre. Montoya braked later than Michael Schumacher, locked his rear tyres and went off the racing line to block on the dirty part of the circuit, causing him to run into the gravel trap with the latter trapped to his left. Michael Schumacher ran wide onto some grass to avoid colliding with Montoya; he dropped to sixth and Montoya seventh. Barrichello took the lead with Verstappen second and Coulthard third. Bernoldi retired in the garage with a hydraulic system failure on lap 17 as Burti was overtaken by his teammate Alesi for 12th. Six laps later, after dropping away from Barrichello, Verstappen made the first of two pit stops, rejoining the circuit in seventh. In the meantime, Michael Schumacher set a series of fast lap times to get closer to Panis. He lost momentum behind Panis but overtook him around the inside for fourth on lap 25.

On lap 26, Marques pulled off to the side of the track to retire with a gearbox failure. Two laps later, Michael Schumacher caught Räikkönen, slipstreamed him and made a pass for third place going into Gosser corner with no counter-challenge. On the same lap, Alesi overtook de la Rosa for 10th and Button got ahead of Burti for 12th on the lap after. By lap 35, Michael Schumacher set a new official track record of 1 minute and 11.179 seconds as he drew to within a second of Coulthard in second. Panis ran wide on the entry to the final corner at the end of the following lap and gave Montoya fifth. At this point, Coulthard and Michael Schumacher lapped half a second faster than race leader Barrichello as Michael Schumacher came to within a tenth of a second of Coulthard. Two more retirements occurred during this stage of the Grand Prix: Alonso had a gearbox fault on the 39th lap and Montoya stopped on an escape road with a loss of hydraulic pressure two laps later.

On the 44th lap, the first round of pit stops for the leaders began when Panis made a pit stop from fifth. He rejoined in sixth and Verstappen entered the pit lane on the next lap. Michael Schumacher and Räikkönen stopped at the end of lap 46. Coulthard led when Barrichello entered the pit lane on the next lap. Barrichello emerged in second through a fast lap before entering the pit lane, ahead of his teammate Michael Schumacher after the latter lost grip into the final corner and ran sideways onto dirt, losing around 1.6 seconds. Coulthard remained on the circuit for the next three laps by setting the race&#x27;s overall fastest lap on lap 48 at 1 minute and 10.843 seconds to go faster on a lighter fuel load after driving conservatively earlier in the race. After an eight-second pit stop, Coulthard rejoined the circuit 1.3 seconds ahead of Barrichello in second because he required less fuel to go into his car. On lap 50, de la Rosa retired from 12th with a transmission failure. Two laps later, Villeneuve took a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for speeding in the pit lane during his pit stop; he kept eighth. Further down the field, Heidfeld overtook Button for 11th on the 57th lap.

By the 61st lap, Coulthard was a full second in front of Barrichello and was able to keep him out of range for an overtake notwithstanding slower traffic impeding him. Michael Schumacher was a further 1.2 seconds behind in third. Button became the Grand Prix&#x27;s final retirement with fire emerging from the rear of his car and spun on his own oil at the final turn on lap 63. Six laps later, Ferrari&#x27;s team principal Jean Todt invoked team orders on Barrichello (&quot;Let Michael pass for the championship&quot;) to allow Michael Schumacher past and improve his teammate&#x27;s status in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Barrichello ignored repeated instructions from Todt and continued in second; he obeyed at the end of lap 71 by going wide exiting the final corner before the start/finish line and slowing to yield second to Michael Schumacher. After finishing second in every Austrian Grand Prix since 1997, Coulthard increased his advantage to 2.1 seconds by managing his lead and crossed the start/finish line first after 71 laps to take his second victory of the season and the 11th of his career. Raikkonen secured the best finish of his season in fourth. Panis took fifth and Verstappen earned his first point of 2001 as he finished in the final points-paying position of sixth. The final finishers were Irvine, Villeneuve, Heidfeld, Alesi and Burti.

===Post-race===
Out of respect for Paul Morgan, the managing director of Ilmor Engineering, who was killed in a plane crash at the Sywell Aerodrome in Northampton the day before the race, Coulthard refrained from spraying champagne on the podium. In the subsequent press conference, Coulthard spoke of the importance of driving with a heavy fuel tank, &quot;I was able to lean the engine out early on after the first few laps and save quite a few laps of fuel as well as obviously with the safety car and that enabled us to go quite long.&quot; Michael Schumacher said he executed a manual start after a launch control system fault and that his strategy after the collision with Montoya was to wait until the pit stops, adding, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. I could have stayed behind and wait all race until the pit stops. But then I wouldn&#x27;t have had a chance to have a go to get back up to the lead, which at some stage I thought I could.&quot; Barrichello stated he began on used front tyres and unused rear compounds and believed he would have won had Coulthard not remained on track for another three laps, &quot;It was one of those races where I had a good feeling, I had a good car, I was really driving as fast as I could behind him, but there was very little to take away and unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t go to win again.&quot;

Opinions over the application of team orders within Ferrari on the final lap were mixed. Alonso called it &quot;a strange decision&quot; since it was early in the season and the technical director of McLaren Adrian Newey felt it went against Formula One&#x27;s moral principles. Villeneuve said he was puzzled at those who expressed shock over the order due to Barrichello&#x27;s status as Ferrari&#x27;s second driver and the Jaguar team principal and three-time world champion Niki Lauda argued it was the correct decision because of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s higher placing in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Ferrari held a post-race meeting with senior staff to discuss the situation. Barrichello later insisted the orders had not demotivated him, &quot;Of course, I was unhappy to be asked to move over. The one thing that makes my life difficult at Ferrari is nothing to do with the team structure or team orders, it is just the simple fact that Michael is a good driver.&quot;

The finishing order outside of the top three remained provisional because BAR lodged an appeal with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA)-aligned Royal Automobile Club over its belief Räikkönen overtook Panis under yellow flag conditions necessitated for Button&#x27;s retirement on lap 66. It came about when the team&#x27;s protest to the stewards was rejected following a review of video footage resulting in the conclusion there was no incident since it was unreported by track marshals. Craig Pollock, the BAR team owner, explained the appeal was lodged because the constructor sought clarity over the regulation preventing drivers from passing under yellow flag conditions. BAR&#x27;s appeal was heard by a panel of judges at a meeting of the FIA&#x27;s International Court of Appeal in Paris on 1 June. The judges upheld the stewards&#x27; original verdict and confirmed the race&#x27;s original result. BAR stated their satisfaction with the result.

Michael Schumacher said he was upset about the incident with Montoya on lap 16 that forced both drivers to lose positions and vowed to speak to the Colombian, &quot;I am a little bit upset obviously because there is no way he could make that corner. He just went off and took me with him. He had lost it anyway and all he could do was do something to me. Sooner or later I would have passed him anyway.&quot; Montoya&#x27;s response was, &quot;If he (Schumacher) thinks he has been granted by divine grace some right which allows him to overtake wherever he wants, I have news for him: he can forget it. He won&#x27;t intimidate me, because I&#x27;m not psychologically fragile as other drivers.&quot; After reviewing television footage of the incident, Michael Schumacher told the press he now agreed with Montoya&#x27;s perspective it was &quot;a racing incident&quot;, adding, &quot;It has to be said that, when you sit in the car you don&#x27;t get the overview of the situation, which you can have looking from outside.&quot;

The race result saw Coulthard reduce Michael Schumacher&#x27;s advantage in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to four points. Barrichello remained in third with 18 points and he extended his advantage over the fourth-placed Ralf Schumacher to six points. Heidfeld continued to round out the top five with eight points. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari retained the same 18-point gap over McLaren in second and Williams maintained third. Sauber in fifth made up three points over Jordan in fourth with eleven races left in the season.

<text>The 2001 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the Grand Prix de Monaco 2001) was a Formula One motor race held before 100,000 spectators at the Circuit de Monaco in La Condamine and Monte Carlo on 27 May. It was the seventh race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 59th Monaco Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher won the 78-lap race for the Ferrari team. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second with Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine third.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship going into the event and his team Ferrari were first from McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard, who qualified in pole position by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, stalled at the start of the formation lap because of an electronic launch control system fault, leading to Schumacher inheriting his position. Schumacher maintained the lead in the first laps with Mika Häkkinen second and Barrichello third. Häkkinen responded to Schumacher&#x27;s pace before he lost second to Barrichello on lap 13 because his car pulled to the right. Schumacher continued to lead until he made a pit stop on the 55th lap, relinquishing it to Barrichello for four laps. He would return to first position and held it to achieve his fourth victory of the season and the 48th of his career.

As a consequence of the race, Michael Schumacher extended his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from four to twelve points over Coulthard. Barrichello maintained third and Ralf Schumacher remained in fourth after he retired late in the event. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari extended their lead over McLaren to 32 points. Williams and Jordan kept third and fourth and Sauber maintained fifth with ten races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2001 Monaco Grand Prix was the 7th of the 17 races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 59th edition of the event. It was held at the 19-turn Circuit de Monaco between La Condamine and Monte Carlo on 27 May. There were 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) entering two drivers each for the event. Before the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 42 points, ahead of McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard in second with 38 and the second Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello in third with 18. Ralf Schumacher of Williams was fourth with 12 points, and Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld was fifth with 8 points. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with 60 points, McLaren and Williams were second and third with 42 and 18 points, as Jordan and Sauber contended for fourth place.

Michael Schumacher had won three of the six preceding races of and took pole position in five of them. He was optimistic about his prospects of equalling Graham Hill&#x27;s record of five Monaco Grand Prix victories, &quot;Traditionally, I have always gone well in Monte Carlo. On top of that, we have a great car this year and so I think we will be very competitive in our fight with McLaren for pole position and the win.&quot; Coulthard, the 2000 Monaco race winner, said he wanted to repeat his success from the year before and saw an opportunity to take the lead of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine said he was optimistic for Monaco because of his finishing record at the track, &quot;I have a good track record at this place, with a second, a third and last year fourth place to my name. I am reasonably optimistic about our chances this weekend.&quot;

Following the Austrian Grand Prix two weeks prior, where four cars stalled at the start because of electronic launch control systems failures, concerns were voiced by the technical director of Williams Patrick Head and Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli over driver safety because of the possibility of stranded vehicles and a major accident. Others differed with Coulthard saying that launch control could help make faster getaways, and Michael Schumacher predicted that there would be no repeat of cars being unable to start, noting that McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen stalled at the Brazilian Grand Prix without launch control. Max Mosley, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) president, advised teams to switch off their launch control systems if they expressed concerns over its reliability; he ruled out banning the aid for the Monaco race. Jordan subsequently deactivated launch control on their EJ11s and opted for a manual system due to the Circuit de Monaco&#x27;s narrow characteristic. Although the FIA warned of &quot;severe penalties&quot; for teams who did not correctly set-up the systems, it allowed drivers to rehearse their starts at the conclusion of Thursday&#x27;s practice sessions and Sunday&#x27;s warm-up session.

Due to the configuration of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Prost introduced new front and rear wings, undertray and rear crash structure to Jean Alesi&#x27;s car. Benetton fitted a revised aerodynamic package with new front and rear wings and sidepods to its B201s. Jaguar ran with a revised rear crash structure to match its new diffuser and new rear wing components and undertray from Saturday&#x27;s practice sessions. Arrows debuted an elevated nose wing positioned vertically on two uprights over the top of Jos Verstappen&#x27;s front wing aimed at increasing the maximum amount of downforce available. Jordan introduced a similar modification on Trulli&#x27;s car; their design was positioned in front of the driver. The devices were examined after Thursday&#x27;s practice sessions by the FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer, who believed they were an infringement of Formula One regulations. Jordan and Arrows were required to remove the devices for safety reasons, and the stewards warned the two teams that they risked exclusion from the Grand Prix if they were used again.

==Practice==

A total of four practice sessions preceded Sunday&#x27;s race—two one-hour sessions on Thursday, and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. Both of Thursday&#x27;s sessions saw dry and warm weather. In the morning practice session, Michael Schumacher lapped fastest at 1:21.577, 0.827 seconds faster than Coulthard in second. The two Jordan cars of Trulli and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Barrichello, Häkkinen, Olivier Panis of British American Racing (BAR), Ralf Schumacher, Irvine and Alesi followed in the top ten. On a dirty track, Pedro de la Rosa damaged the front left corner of his Jaguar by hitting a barrier at Portier turn, and Tarso Marques spun his Minardi car 180 degrees backwards into a wall at the entry to La Rascasse corner. Since spare cars could not be driven until qualifying on Saturday, neither driver returned to the track for the rest of the session.

Häkkinen led the afternoon session with the day&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1:19.853, with Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Trulli, Coulthard, Frentzen, Alesi, BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve and Williams&#x27; Juan Pablo Montoya in positions two through ten. Coulthard struck a barrier at Tabac corner and broke his car&#x27;s right-front track rod, which was replaced in the pit lane. Fernando Alonso spun his Minardi into a wall at La Rascasse turn and damaged its rear suspension, curtailing his session. With 15 minutes to go, Montoya damaged his car&#x27;s rear at La Rascasse turn, and the session was stopped for four minutes as track marshals extricated him. His teammate Ralf Schumacher crashed his cars front-left at the Swimming Pool complex. Two track marshals retrieving Schumacher&#x27;s front wing narrowly avoided being hit by Enrique Bernoldi&#x27;s Arrows car. Irvine spun at the Novelle Chicane and Michael Schumacher swerved to avoid hitting his car.

After taking Friday off—a feature of the event timetable unique to Monaco— the drivers returned to action on Saturday morning in clear weather. Ralf Schumacher complained of head and neck pain following his crash in the second session and was treated by his team&#x27;s physiotherapist before being ordered to rest until Saturday. Nevertheless, he lapped quickest in the third practice session at 1:21.036, ahead of Villeneuve, Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen, Irvine, Alesi, Frentzen, Panis and Trulli. After 13 minutes, Verstappen&#x27;s engine failed, and laid oil at La Rascasse corner, prompting a quarter of an hour stoppage for marshals to clear it with sand. Luciano Burti&#x27;s Prost car had a mechanical failure that sent him veering into the Sainte Devote tyre wall and narrowly avoided hitting multiple stationary recovery vehicles with three minutes remaining. Burti was unhurt.

The delay to dry the oil at La Rascasse turn delayed the start of the fourth session by 10 minutes. Once underway, Häkkinen was fastest with a lap of 1:18.282, followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, Irvine, Trulli, Montoya, Barrichello, Alesi and Frentzen. Alonso spun 180 degrees at the Loews hairpin and blocked the track. Frentzen stopped into Casino Square corner and track marshals extricated his car. Räikkönen and Bernoldi had separate crashes at the Swimming Pool complex and La Rascasse corner; Bernoldi&#x27;s front wing got lodged in Häkkinen&#x27;s front suspension. Giancarlo Fisichella spun at La Racasse and blocked the circuit as track marshals extricated his Benetton car.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver to set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Conditions were warm and sunny for qualifying, and many drivers had an old set of front tyres on their cars. Coulthard broke the unofficial track lap record set by Frentzen in 1997, and took his second pole position of the season, and the 12th of his career with a time of 1:17.430. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Michael Schumacher who was 0.201 seconds slower after aborting his first timed lap because Bernoldi caught him off guard exiting the tunnel and he lost a tenth of a second by glancing the left-hand side at Le Portier turn. Häkkinen changed his car&#x27;s set-up for a final timed run but it gave him excess understeer and a lack of front grip, leaving him third. Fourth-placed Barrichello worked with his engineers following the final practice session to improve his car&#x27;s performance; he flat-spotted his front-right tyre at Sainte Devote turn. Ralf Schumacher was the best of the Michelin tyre runners in fifth after Jenson Button of the Benetton team impeded his final timed lap. Sixth-placed Irvine was delayed on his third timed lap and braked early for the Novelle Chicane.

Montoya was seventh in his first appearance at Monaco since the 1998 International Formula 3000 Championship. Trulli secured eighth from losing about two-tenths of a second due to a slower car baulking him. Villeneuve qualified ninth and Fisichella in tenth added more front wing angle to create a balanced car. Alesi was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; he improved on each of his timed laps and made contact with a barrier in the tunnel. Panis in 12th went too quickly at the Piscine chicane on his last lap. Frentzen in 13th spun at Portier corner before the entrance of the tunnel, and he abandoned his car because the constricting barriers left him with little room to recover. De La Rosa was 14th, followed by Räikkönen in 15th, who encountered an abundance of traffic and a waved yellow flag on his final timed lap. His Sauber teammate Heidfeld had an unrectifiable electronic throttle problem on his second timed lap and he took the team&#x27;s spare car to qualify 16th. Car problems as well as his engine&#x27;s lack of horsepower created handling balance difficulties and traffic left Button in 17th. Alonso began ahead of both the Arrows cars and Burti&#x27;s Prost in 18th. Marques, 22nd, had excess oversteer.

==Warm-up==
A 30-minute warm-up session was held on Sunday morning in dry weather. Coulthard led the session with a time of 1:20.944, ahead of his teammate Häkkinen in second. The Ferrari cars of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello, Frentzen, Ralf Schumacher, Irvine, Verstappen, de la Rosa and Fisichella followed in the top ten. While the session passed relatively peacefully, Marques crashed into an Armco metal barrier at Anthony Noghes corner.

==Race==
The 78-lap race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time and before 100,000 spectators, over a distance of . The weather was dry and sunny, with the air temperature and a track temperature between . Several teams began on the soft compound tyres; a one-stop strategy was determined to be ideal, with some drivers making their first pit stops early to advance their position and others stopping later because of a similar performance level. At the start of the formation lap, an electronic launch control software glitch caused Coulthard&#x27;s engine to stall, prompting the McLaren mechanics to restart his engine; he was required to begin from the back of the grid. His teammate Häkkinen was stuck behind him; he drove away before the final car passed him and was allowed to start from third place. Michael Schumacher was effective the first driver on the starting grid and made an unchallenged, clean start to lead the field into Sainte Devote, ahead of Häkkinen and Barrichello. Montoya passed Irvine for fifth when the latter ran wide attempting to pass Ralf Schumacher on the left at Sainte Devote corner. Behind the two, Verstappen lost control of his car and made contact with Burti. Verstappen fell to 20th as Burti had one of his endplates removed.

On the run to the exit of Portier corner, Heidfeld and Bernoldi collided, causing Heidfeld to be launched over one of Bernoldi&#x27;s wheels, and sending him straight into a barrier, making him the race&#x27;s first retirement on lap one. At the first lap&#x27;s conclusion, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 1.5 seconds; the duo were followed by Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Montoya and Irvine. Montoya recorded the race&#x27;s fastest lap at that point as he attempted to overtake his teammate Ralf Schumacher. On lap two, Burti fell to 20th when Verstappen and Coulthard passed him. Up front, Michael Schumacher extended his gap over Häkkinen to 1.6 seconds at the start of lap three. That lap, Montoya shifted down a gear, slowed and collected understeer. This put him wide at the entrance of the Swimming Pool complex and hit a barrier. This moved Irvine and Trulli to fifth and sixth respectively. Further back, Marques was passed by Verstappen for 17th and Burti entered the pit lane to replace his damaged front wing. Marques lost a further position through a pass by Coulthard for 18th place on lap four.

Michael Schumacher increased his lead over Häkkinen by another six-tenths of a second on the fifth lap with the latter under pressure from Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher. Häkkinen then went slightly faster to lower the gap to 2.5 seconds and set a new fastest lap under 1 minute and 23 seconds to be 1.6 seconds adrift on the eighth lap, to which Michael Schumacher responded with his own fastest lap after Schumacher had eased off to save fuel and preserve his tyres upon realising that he was not pulling away from Häkkinen. That lap, Verstappen overtook his teammate Bernoldi for 16th and the latter now had Coulthard behind him. Bernoldi was able to remain close behind teammate Verstappen until an issue forced him to change onto a conservative fuel map and lose a small amount of pace. On lap 10, Barrichello began to drop back with a cramp in his right foot, and was advised over the radio by Ferrari&#x27;s technical director Ross Brawn to consume more water and move his toes, causing Barrichello to brake earlier than expected. Two laps later, Coulthard attempted an unsuccessful pass on Bernoldi at Tabac corner. Häkkinen&#x27;s car began to pull to the right on lap 13, and Barrichello overtook him at the exit of the tunnel for second. He entered the pit lane on lap 14 to have his car&#x27;s suspension push rods checked by his mechanics and was stationary for 50 seconds. No damage was found. On the same lap, Panis retired with a steering problem, and Häkkinen did the same two laps later because his problem persisted.

In the meantime, Verstappen got ahead of Button for 12th on lap 15. Button retook the position temporarily soon after as Verstappen re-passed him. Coulthard continued to duel Bernoldi for position but still could not effect a pass, causing him to lap slower than normal. On the 18th lap, tenth-placed de la Rosa had an hydraulics issue losing him gearbox and throttle control. He pulled off at the side of the track to retire on the next lap. On lap 26, Burti, who had a long brake pedal, missed the Sainte Devote corner braking point. He stopped away from the barrier and he retired when his reverse gear failed. Coulthard tried again to overtake Bernoldi on the next lap but the latter defended his position. That allowed Michael Schumacher to lap Coulthard, who could not use the situation to pass Bernoldi. On lap 31, Trulli retired from fifth at La Rascasse turn with flames coming from the rear of his car due to a loss of engine hydraulic pressure. That elevated Fisichella to sixth. As Coulthard allowed Barrichello to lap him on lap 32, he sought to use the opportunity to pass Bernoldi but he could not do so. Two laps later, Fisichella entered Sainte Devote corner too fast, and struck a barrier with his rear wheel. He nonetheless continued in sixth, ahead of Alesi, because his car&#x27;s suspension was undamaged.

Michael Schumacher set a new official lap record of 1 minute and 20.770 seconds on the 38th lap. He further improved it to a time of 1:20.422 four laps later, extending his lead over his teammate Barrichello to 18.3 seconds. On lap 43, Fisichella had an hydraulic failure that caused his gearbox to fail, and he crashed into the tyre wall at Sainte Devote, removing the front left wheel from his car. Bernoldi had less fuel in his car than Coulthard&#x27;s and made a pit stop at the end of the following lap, allowing Coulthard to lap 4.5 seconds faster than before. He took advantage of Alonso being lapped by Villeneuve to pass the latter for ninth on lap 48. Two laps later, Frentzen in seventh understeered at the apex and he drifted into a left-hand Armco metal barrier exiting the tunnel at . He slid along the barrier before stopping at the Novelle Chicane and clambered out of his car unhurt. Alesi entered the pit lane on lap 51, and returned to the race still in sixth. Four laps later, Michael Schumacher made his pit stop from the lead, promoting his teammate Barrichello into first. Further down the order, Alonso retired with a failed gearbox on lap 57. Ralf Schumacher retired from third position in the pit lane on the next lap with an electrical fault that switched off his engine.

Irvine was promoted to third, Villeneuve fourth, Alesi fifth and Coulthard sixth. Barrichello made his pit stop from first position on lap 60, returning the lead to his teammate Michael Schumacher. That lap, Irvine made his pit stop and retained third place. Then, Marques&#x27; driveshaft broke and he drove onto the run-off area at the Novelle Chicane to retire. Six laps later, Coulthard made his pit stop and emerged in front of Button in sixth. He then set the race&#x27;s overall fastest lap at 1 minute and 19.424 seconds on the 68th lap as he drew closer to Alesi in fifth. Prost reacted by calling Alesi into the pit lane on the next lap for new tyres to better his defence of fifth. However, Alesi was delayed and he rejoined the race behind Coulthard in sixth. Michael Schumacher led the last nine laps to take his fourth victory of the season and the 48th of his career, by 0.431 seconds over Barrichello in a staged finish. Irvine achieved Jaguar&#x27;s first podium finish since its debut in Formula One and its first points score of the season in third, ahead of the faster Villeneuve in fourth. Coulthard finished a lap behind in fifth, being approximately a minute behind Villeneuve, and Alesi took sixth. Button took seventh after coping with an understeer which developed into an oversteer and could not draw closer to Alesi, who was 28 seconds ahead of him at the finish. Verstappen and Bernoldi followed in positions eight to nine. Räikkönen was five laps down and the last finisher in tenth after an early race pit stop to rectify a wheel sensor failure and he had no traction control. The attrition rate was high with 12 of the 22 drivers not finishing the race.

===Post-race===

The top three drivers appeared in Prince Rainier III of Monaco&#x27;s royal box to collect their trophies and appeared in the subsequent press conference to speak to the media. Michael Schumacher said he felt little emotion on the podium because he took &quot;a very straightforward win&quot; and that finishing the race was the most important aspect because the circuit is narrow, &quot;Although it was an easy drive, it was still hard to some degree, because we were still doing reasonably fast lap times. I don&#x27;t know what it so special.&quot; Barrichello stated his cramp disappeared after his pit stop, &quot;I was asking God to give me a chance to race because the car was brilliant. I never had a car as good as this one of today. But as Michael was saying, I had to save so much because I couldn&#x27;t do anything else.&quot; Irvine spoke of his delight to finish third and stated his hope to continue Jaguar&#x27;s form into the , &quot;It&#x27;s good for all the guys in the team. Everyone&#x27;s been working very hard. We haven&#x27;t been getting very far to be honest until these new aerodynamics arrived on Saturday so it&#x27;s good for the guys in factory.&quot;

Bernoldi, who battled Coulthard for 35 laps, alleged that the McLaren team principal Ron Dennis and the director of motorsport for Mercedes-Benz Norbert Haug had approached him and threatened to shorten his career if a similar scenario occurred in the future, a claim that Dennis denied, &quot;It was quite a while after the race when I talked to him and I was cool, calm, and collected and I was not angry. I just told him that in my opinion it was unsporting behaviour.&quot; An audio tape released to the press by McLaren on 11 June vindicated Dennis; according to transcribers he said to Bernoldi, &quot;that was not sporting and you shouldn&#x27;t carry on like that.&quot; Bernoldi told Dennis he was following orders and was not required to allow Coulthard past since the latter was on the same lap as the former. The Arrows team principal Tom Walkinshaw rejected a claim by Dennis that Bernoldi would not permit Coulthard to pass Bernoldi for television exposure. Coulthard spoke of his belief that Bernoldi was over defensive and said he would raise the issue at the next Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association meeting, &quot;We agreed not to move once a driver has made his move. You make your decision – and up the hill a couple of times I was coming to get my wheels alongside him and he moved over.&quot; Bernoldi argued he was driving a routine race and was on the circuit to better his driving ability.

After the race, the FIA examined several Bridgestone tyres for possible illegal wear. It discovered nothing abnormal and the result of the race was declared final. Jackie Stewart, the three-time Formula One World Champion and Jaguar team founder, praised Irvine&#x27;s performance and the driver&#x27;s maturity, &quot;He practised well, he qualified well and he raced well. You couldn&#x27;t ask for more. He proved himself here by driving in a very controlled way so he was ready to take advantage of opportunities and to resist any pressure from Jacques (Villeneuve) at the end.&quot; Alesi earned his first points finish since coming sixth in the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix and the Prost team&#x27;s first since Trulli&#x27;s second-place result at the 1999 European Grand Prix. He declared the result &quot;a great thing&quot; for himself and Prost and said that he predicted similar results in the future, &quot;I totally enjoyed my race. But towards the end, when I felt the car vibrating in the tunnel, I was really worried. It was a flat tyre and I had to go back to the pits to change it, which cost me the fifth place points. What is really important today is that I scored the first point for the team this year – or last.&quot;

The result increased Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 12 points over Coulthard. Barrichello consolidated third position as Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s non-finish kept him in fourth. Heidfeld was in fifth place. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari increased their advantage over McLaren to 32 points. Williams and Jordan still held third and fourth places and Sauber were fifth with ten races remaining in the season.

<text>The 2001 Canadian Grand Prix (formally the Grand Prix Air Canada 2001) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 June 2001 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec in front of a crowd of 111,000 people. It was the eighth round of the 2001 Formula One season and the 33rd Canadian Grand Prix as part of the Formula One World Championship. The 69-lap race was won by Williams driver Ralf Schumacher after starting from the second position. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher finished second and McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen came third.

Michael Schumacher won the thirty-eighth pole position of his career by posting the fastest lap in qualifying and he maintained his lead going into the first corner. He opened up his lead to 1.1 seconds until Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s tyres reached their optimum operating temperatures and he lowered his advantage to four-tenths of a second until a safety car was required on lap twenty for separate accidents for Rubens Barrichello and Juan Pablo Montoya. It was on track for the next three laps although Michael Schumacher extended his lead once again at the restart, Ralf Schumacher again reduced it as he sought his way past on the track but he did so after the pit stop cycle on lap fifty-one. Ralf Schumacher held the lead for the last eighteen laps to claim his second victory of the season and it marked the first time siblings had finished first and second in Formula One.

The result of the race meant Michael Schumacher increased his lead at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship to eighteen points ahead of David Coulthard who retired due to an engine failure in the final fifteen laps of the race. Barrichello maintained third position despite his crash, Ralf Schumacher stayed in fourth and Häkkinen rounded out the top five. Ferrari increased their advantage over McLaren in the Constructors&#x27; Championship to 38 points and Williams retained third with nine rounds left in the season.

==Background==
The 2001 Canadian Grand Prix was the eighth of seventeen scheduled races of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the thirty-third edition of the event as part of the Formula One World Championship. It was held on 10 June at the thirteen-turn Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec. Going into the eighth round of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 52 points, ahead of his nearest championship rival David Coulthard of McLaren (40) and Rubens Barrichello in the second Ferrari (24). Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher was in fourth on twelve points and Nick Heidfeld of Sauber was fifth with eight points. Ferrari led the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 76 points; McLaren and Williams were second and third with 44 and 18 points respectively. Jordan with 13 points and Sauber with twelve contended for fourth place in the standings.

Michael Schumacher had won the Canadian Grand Prix four times in his career up until the 2001 race and spoke of his confidence that he could win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for the fifth time despite his dislike of the track due to his preference of high-speed corners, &quot;The records I have in Montreal are good but that means nothing now as it is a new challenge. We need to be prepared to do a good job. It will be a tight competition between us and probably McLaren and Williams, and anyone else who has improved a lot.&quot; His brother Ralf Schumacher stated that he hoped to extend his points tally after a poor performance at the preceding Monaco Grand Prix, &quot;I think the Circuit Giles Villeneuve could be pretty favourable to our car as we have a powerful engine, which is essential there. It&#x27;s not particularly demanding on the drivers, as it is basically a &quot;stop-and-go&quot; track. I like Montreal and I am looking forward to being there, hoping this time I will be able to finish my race and be in the points.&quot;

==Practice==
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final practice sessions were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. Conditions were dry and sunny for the Friday practice sessions. Coulthard was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 18.763 seconds, almost four-tenths of a second faster than Barrichello in second. His teammate Michael Schumacher was third and was fastest before Coulthard&#x27;s and Barrichello&#x27;s late session laps. Mika Häkkinen, Olivier Panis, Heidfeld, Jarno Trulli, Kimi Räikkönen, Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya rounded out the session&#x27;s top ten drivers. Jacques Villeneuve lost the rear of his BAR leaving turn five and struck the barriers lining the circuit at the next corner, heavily damaging his car which rested upon a tyre wall. Villeneuve was unhurt but he was forced to miss the remainder of the session. This came after Villeneuve drove behind Montoya and overtook him before stopping in front of him heading into the L&#x27;Epingle hairpin. Montoya spoke of his feeling that Villeneuve had &quot;brake-tested&quot; him but Villeneuve blamed Montoya. In the second practice session, Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the day with the only time under the one minute and 18 seconds range at one minute and 17.692 seconds, followed by his teammate Coulthard, Eddie Irvine, Barrichello, Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Heidfeld, Trulli, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Panis.

At the drivers&#x27; briefing later on Friday, Montoya reportedly threatened to place Villeneuve in the wall and Villeneuve responded by saying he would put Montoya in a tree. Montoya then told Villeneuve that he &quot;killed&quot; marshal Graham Beveridge in a crash at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix three months earlier. His remark prompted Villeneuve to grab Montoya by the collar on his racing overalls in an attempt to choke him, causing Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) race director Charlie Whiting to intervene to stop the altercation. Both drivers were later summoned into a meeting where Whiting warned them that they would face a ban of two races in the event of future altercations. After a heavy accident with the tyre barrier at turn three in the second practice session that measured at 19 g, Frentzen complained of double vision and headaches and he withdrew from the race to travel to a clinic in Nice for tests to his vision and balance. His car was taken over by Jordan test and reserve driver Ricardo Zonta for the remainder of the weekend after the stewards granted Jordan&#x27;s request under the Formula One Sporting Code.

Weather conditions remained dry and clear for the Saturday practice sessions. Häkkinen paced the third practice session with a time of one minute and 16.628 seconds. His teammate Coulthard was 0.047 seconds slower in second and Michael Schumacher was third. Barrichello in the second Ferrari car was fourth, Ralf Schumacher placed fifth and Irvine sixth. Heidfeld, Pedro de la Rosa, Räikkönen and Panis filled positions seven through ten. In the final practice session, Michael Schumacher was fastest with a one-minute and 16.200 seconds lap. Coulthard in the faster of the two McLarens came second and his teammate Häkkinen was third. Fourth place went to Barrichello while the Sauber duo of Heidfeld and Räikkönen placed fifth and sixth. Panis was seventh-fastest, Ralf Schumacher eighth, Trulli and de la Rosa completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Zonta&#x27;s brakes snatched away and he ran into the gravel trap beside the circuit sixteen minutes into practice and Jean Alesi spun and stalled his car twenty minutes later.

==Qualifying==

Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver to set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Conditions were warm and clear for qualifying. Michael Schumacher took the thirty-eighth pole position of his career with a one-minute and 15.782 seconds lap that he set with twelve minutes remaining. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Ralf Schumacher who set a time 0.515 seconds slower than his brother after heavily altering his car&#x27;s set-up. Coulthard ran wide at the final chicane during his first timed lap but improved in the final sector on his last try for third. Fourth-placed Trulli was ordered to &quot;parc fermé&quot; at the entry of the pit lane and he felt it prevented him from bettering his time due to the long amount of time he was kept there by marshals. Barrichello qualified fifth but he was the cause of the first red flag when he launched over the kerbing at the final chicane and hit the Wall of Champions sideways with the right-hand side of his vehicle. He was unhurt and he drove the spare Ferrari F2001 optimised for his teammate Michael Schumacher. Panis took sixth and Räikkönen understeered on the run into the L&#x27;Epingle hairpin and narrowly avoided the Wall of Champions after going airborne over the kerbs at the final turn. Häkkinen switched to the spare McLaren MP4-16 optimised for his teammate Coulthard after damaging his main car&#x27;s right-hand side radiator and undertray by launching over the high kerb at the final corner but a misfiring engine restricted him to eighth. Villeneuve and Montoya rounded out the top ten qualifiers.

Heidfeld was the fastest competitor not to qualify in the top ten because his best lap time was 1.383 seconds slower than Michael Schumacher&#x27;s pole lap and Heidfeld triggered the second stoppage with two minutes to go when he crashed heavily at the final chicane and his car&#x27;s monocoque was rebuilt for the race. Zonta achieved his team principal Eddie Jordan&#x27;s prediction qualifying twelfth and made a driving error on the approach to the first corner. Jos Verstappen begun from thirteenth. The Jaguar pair of de la Rosa and Irvine placed fourteenth and fifteenth and the former slowed and he was almost hit by Irvine leaving the final chicane. Alesi had brake instability and a lack of traction en route to sixteenth and his Prost teammate Luciano Burti could not optimise his car&#x27;s handling for nineteenth. On his maiden appearance at the circuit, Enrique Bernoldi qualified seventeenth and Giancarlo Fisichella took eighteenth in the faster of the two Benettons as he picked up a large amount of understeer due to changes in the track surface and changed his car&#x27;s downforce for better straightline speed. Jenson Button had an excessive amount of understeer and he took twentieth. The Minardis of Fernando Alonso and Tarso Marques occupied the final row of the grid in twenty-first and twenty-second. After qualifying, Alonso had all of his qualifying times disallowed because the front wing on his car was found by scrutineers to be less than above the regulation reference plate.

===Qualifying classification===
;Notes
* — Fernando Alonso was excluded from qualifying due to an illegal front wing.

==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a half an hour warm-up session to fine tune their cars in warm and clear conditions. Panis ran faster than he had done during the weekend with the session&#x27;s fastest lap of one minute and 18.512 seconds. Coulthard was the faster of the two McLarens in second and his teammate Häkkinen set the fifth fastest-time after the team rebuilt his car overnight. They were separated by Zonta and Irvine in third and fourth places. Schumacher was the sixth-fastest driver in the time sheets and concentrated on assessing two versions of front wings for his vehicle and car set-up for the race.

==Race==
The race began at 13:00 Eastern Standard Time (UTC+05:00). Weather conditions at the start were clear and dry. The air temperature ranged from and the track temperature was between ; forecasts predicted no rainfall during the Grand Prix. A record crowd of 111,000 spectators attended the event. Engine stress and fuel consumption were the two main factors for the Grand Prix as the optimum strategy was one of a solitary pit stop. However, a driver in a lightly fuelled car could have an advantage over his rivals and this often resulted in less stress being put on the brakes. Michael Schumacher made a good start to hold the first position from Ralf Schumacher on the inside line going into the first corner. Coulthard in third place was heavily fuelled for a one-stop strategy and he led a close pack of cars. Verstappen was lightly fuelled and he gained seven places to move into seventh, while Zonta moved from twelfth to ninth. Barrichello overtook Trulli for fourth later in the lap. Further back in the field, Fisichella ran into the rear of Bernoldi&#x27;s slower car at the L&#x27;Epingle hairpin and damaged the front wing on his car. Then, on the back straight, Button steered to the left to avoid striking Bernoldi but doing this meant his teammate Fisichella drove into the rear of his car.

At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led Ralf Schumacher by three-tenths of a second. Following another six-tenths of a second in arrears was Coulthard and the rest of the order was Barrichello, Trulli, Panis, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Zonta, Häkkinen, Montoya, Heidfeld, Irvine, de la Rosa, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Marques, Button, Alesi, Alonso and Burti. Fisichella&#x27;s right-front suspension was broken and he drove into the pit lane to retire. On lap two, Irvine made contact with one of Heidfeld&#x27;s rear tyres going into turn three and both drivers spun into the grass. Both drivers retired from the race because of the amount of damage to their cars. Marques was passed by Button for fifteenth on the same lap. Barrichello slipstreamed Coulthard and he overtook him around the inside for third at the end of the third lap. That same lap, Ralf Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race at that point at one minute and 20.797 seconds, until Barrichello bettered it by eight-tenths of a second on lap four to draw closer to him. In the meantime, Marques fell behind Alesi and Alonso. By the start of lap five, Michael Schumacher established a lead of a 1.1 seconds over Ralf Schumacher who was still being put under pressure by Barrichello.

Barrichello switched off his traction control system two laps earlier because it caused his engine to misfire. On the sixth lap, the lack of traction control caused Barrichello to lose control of his car and spin leaving the L&#x27;Epingle chicane. He fell to fourteenth and his spin Coulthard returned to third place. Burti got ahead of Marques for nineteenth on that lap. Button was issued a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap seven because he was adjudged to have jumped the start. He took the penalty on the next lap. Alonso pulled off to the side of the circuit in the third sector with a broken driveshaft CV joint on lap eight. Bernoldi made the first pit stop of the Grand Prix on the ninth lap per the instruction of his team to remove a paper bag from his radiator to stop his engine from overheating. On the eleventh and twelve laps, Barrichello got past Villeneuve and de la Rosa to move into eleventh. At the front of the field, Ralf Schumacher lowered Michael Schumacher&#x27;s advantage to less than a second when his tyres reached their optimum operating temperatures and he further reduced his brother&#x27;s lead to four-tenths of a second on lap fifteen. He continued to push hard to remain close by Michael Schumacher, hoping the latter would make a driver error. Button retired in the pit lane with an oil leak on lap 18.

The safety car was deployed on lap twenty when Montoya lost control of the rear of his car over a kerb and crashed into the wall at turn four alongside the circuit. Barrichello was close behind Montoya and his attempt to swerve to avoid hitting his car caused him to oversteer into the inside barrier after appearing to lock his brakes heavily. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap 23 and Michael Schumacher maintained his lead over Ralf Schumacher at the rolling restart. Michael Schumacher opened out a lead of 2.6 seconds over Ralf Schumacher who could not match his pace due to extra tyre rubber he picked up under the safety car. Bernoldi retired on lap 25 because of an overheating engine. The following lap, Verstappen passed Marques for thirteenth. De La Rosa attempted to overtake Häkkinen for eighth on the approach to the final corner on lap 27 but Häkkinen repelled the manoeuvre. Ralf Schumacher reduced Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead to one-and-a-half seconds by lap thirty and he further lowered it to 0.521 seconds two laps later. Further back on lap 34, Zonta and Räikkönen made contact on the back straight but both drivers continued without major damage to their cars. That same lap, Villeneuve retired with a broken driveshaft after having earlier problems with his brakes.

On lap 35 Ralf Schumacher tried to overtake Michael Schumacher on the inside line but he backed out of the manoeuvre at the chicane. Häkkinen overtook Zonta for seventh on the same lap. The following lap, Ralf Schumacher again tried to pass Michael Schumacher but this time by going around the outside of him and was unsuccessful. Häkkinen gained another position when he overtook his fellow Finnish driver Räikkönen entering turn ten for sixth. Panis retired on lap 38 from a long brake pedal that prevented him from stopping his car. Green flag pit stops for tyres and fuel began that lap when Trulli entered the pit lane. Räikkönen and Alesi made pit stops over laps thirty-nine and forty-one. In the meantime, Ralf Schumacher twice tried to overtake Michael Schumacher but he was unsuccessful on both attempts. Just as his teammate Häkkinen was about to pass, Coulthard made his pit stop from third on lap 42. Michael Schumacher made his pit stop four laps later, handing the lead to Ralf Schumacher who increased his pace in his attempt to get ahead of his brother after his own stop by lowering the race track lap record three times. He entered the pit lane at the end of lap fifty-one and emerged 6.4 seconds in front of Michael Schumacher.

Four laps later, Coulthard&#x27;s engine failed on the back straight because of rising water temperatures, curtailing his race. Trulli was afflicted by a brake hydraulic problem which caused his pace to lower and he was overtaken by Räikkönen, Alesi and Verstappen between laps 62 and 63. He drove into the pit lane on lap 64 to retire. Two laps later, Verstappen spun into the barrier due to a failure of his front brakes and was the final retirement of the Grand Prix. Unhindered in the final 15 laps, Ralf Schumacher increased his lead to more than twenty seconds and he crossed the start/finish line after 69 laps to claim the second victory of the season and of his career after his maiden win at the San Marino Grand Prix two months earlier. Michael Schumacher finished in second, achieving the first one-two finish for siblings in the history of Formula One. Häkkinen completed the podium in third. Off the podium, Räikkönen took fourth, Alesi fifth and de la Rosa completed the point-scoring finishers. in sixth. The Brazilian trio of Zonta, Burti and Marques were the final finishers.

===Post-race ===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Ralf Schumacher said that he and his brother had not competed against each other competitively in go-kart racing and that the Montréal was the first time of doing so, &quot;It was obviously a great race today. The whole time the two of us together I was waiting for him to make a mistake. Obviously he didn&#x27;t. I tried it a couple of times at the end of the straight but then it was difficult, so I waited for the pit strategy when I thought that we would go longer anyway and it worked out that way.&quot; Michael Schumacher spoke of a &quot;happy family day&quot; and stated that he was aware his brother was experienced enough not to make a driving error, &quot;He obviously was close to overtaking but when you&#x27;re inside, basically you have to brake a little bit earlier to make the corner and I was braking very late to try the maximum and as he said, he was going longer than I was, so I understand that he didn&#x27;t take the maximum risk for either of us. It worked out for him.&quot; Häkkinen revealed that McLaren&#x27;s objective was to finish in the top three but lamented that he could not get into the slipstream of the cars ahead of him due to the lack of acceleration from his car leaving the L&#x27;Epingle hairpin.

Frank Williams, owner of the Williams team, commented that he felt Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s victory demonstrated that the driver as much as skill as his brother and Häkkinen, &quot;Ralf is a natural winner who is going to get better and better and he gets older and more experienced. I remember telling people in the middle of 1999 that if Ralf was in a winning car, a Ferrari or a McLaren, he would already have won races. His manner of winning was exemplary.&quot; Although his engine failed, Coulthard was still confident of reducing the lead of Michael Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship over the rest of the season, &quot;It (the title) is still achievable. But I can only do what I can do. Walking on water isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve mastered yet. I think Ferrari still have a bit of a qualifying advantage because they use their tyres better but I still think we have a strong race car. I still believe I can win Grands Prix and be a challenge to Michael.&quot; Button and Fischella apologised to each other following their collision on the first lap of the Grand Prix and the technical director of Benetton Mike Gascoyne insisted that neither driver was to blame.

The result of the race meant Michael Schumacher maintained his lead at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 58 points. Coulthard was still in second but his retirement meant Schumacher increased his lead to eighteen points and Barrichello kept the third position. Ralf Schumacher stayed in the fourth position despite his victory and Häkkinen&#x27;s podium finish allowed him to advance into fifth place in the standings. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari increased their advantage over McLaren to thirty-six points. Williams maintained third with 28 points. Sauber moved past their rivals Jordan in the battle for fourth place with nine rounds left in the season. At the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony in Monte Carlo on 15 December, the organiser of the Canadian Grand Prix, Normand Legault was awarded the prize of &quot;Best Promoter&quot;.

<text>The 2001 European Grand Prix (formally the 2001 Warsteiner Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held on 24 June 2001 at the Nürburgring, Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It was the ninth race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the sixth European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. It was also the last race on this layout until the track was modified in 2002. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the 67-lap race from pole position. Williams&#x27;s Juan Pablo Montoya finished second and McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard was third.

Going into the race, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by 18 points over Coulthard and Ferrari led McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Michael Schumacher took pole position after setting the quickest lap in the one-hour qualifying session. He led for most of the race, despite being pushed by his brother Ralf Schumacher, until the Williams driver was penalised for crossing the white line at the pit lane exit following his first pit stop on lap 28. Michael Schumacher finished 4.1 seconds ahead of Montoya for his fifth victory of the season and 49th overall.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s victory increased his World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead to 24 points over Coulthard and 42 ahead of Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello. With eight races left in the season, Ferrari maintained their World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead, 41 points ahead of McLaren and 57 ahead of Williams.

==Background==
The 2001 European Grand Prix was the ninth of seventeen Formula One races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship, held on 24 June 2001, at the clockwise Nürburgring, Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany; the circuit hosted the European Grand Prix for the sixth time since its return in . The Nürburgring&#x27;s layout was used for the final time; it was made longer beginning in .

Before the event, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 58 points; McLaren driver David Coulthard was second on 40 points. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello was third with 24 points, with Williams&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard&#x27;s teammate Mika Häkkinen on 22 and 8 points respectively. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship on 82 points and McLaren were second on 48 points, with Williams third on 28 points. Sauber were fourth with 15 points while Jordan were fifth with 13 points.

Following the on 10 June, the teams tested car setups, components and tyres at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire from 12 to 14 June to prepare for the European and British Grands Prix. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine and Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld withdrew from testing because of a neck pain and a minor headache. Jarno Trulli (Jordan) and British American Racing&#x27;s (BAR) Olivier Panis led the first two days. Alexander Wurz, McLaren&#x27;s test driver, was fastest on the final day, more than six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Minardi cancelled a two-day test at Italy&#x27;s Fiorano Circuit to investigate a driveshaft problem with their car. Ferrari&#x27;s test driver, Luca Badoer, evaluated electronic controls and engine plans in Fiorano before shaking down three cars for the European Grand Prix.

With 90 points available in the next nine Grands Prix, pundits speculated that McLaren may use team orders to favour Coulthard over teammate Häkkinen in the championship race. Coulthard said he was focused on winning races while Häkkinen stated McLaren expected him to win but acknowledged the complexity of the situation. Michael Schumacher was the favourite to win the race, having won four of the previous eight Grands Prix. Despite this, he expressed caution about winning a fourth world title, believing his 18-point lead over Coulthard was insufficient to give him confidence given the large number of points still available. Williams&#x27;s Juan Pablo Montoya had finished only one race across the season and hoped to score points in Germany.

The event featured eleven teams (each representing a different constructor) with two drivers each, with one change from the season entry list. Having missed the previous event due to a concussion, a headache and dizziness resulting from a crash during Friday practice for the Canadian Grand Prix, Jordan driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen was declared fit to race by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s (FIA) Medical Delegate Sid Watkins and returned to his seat taken over by temporary replacement Ricardo Zonta, the team&#x27;s test driver. Zonta was on standby to replace Frentzen if required. Similarly, Irvine recovered from his injured neck, and Heidfeld was suffering from migraines and disorientation after an accident in Canada; both were passed fit to race.

Few teams made significant technical improvements to their cars for the race. Ferrari, McLaren and Williams each installed the same rear wings onto their cars as did at the , while Williams added new aerodynamic side appendages in front of the air intakes, which necessitated the installation of rubber coverings on the outer edges to protect mechanics when the car were parked. BAR introduced a redesigned front suspension and a new nose with lower-section aerodynamic appendages. During Friday practice, Benetton tried a launch control system on both of their cars to provide for a smoother and quicker start. Jaguar fitted its Monaco-specification front wing and curved sidepod winglets onto its R2 cars. Sauber revised their front wing endplates only for the day before the race and Minardi modified Tarso Marques&#x27;s pedals for his large feet. Arrows and Prost introduced no new major changes to their cars.

==Practice==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The first practice on Friday morning was overcast with cold ambient and track conditions. The circuit was dirty, forcing some drivers to lose control and run into the gravel trap. Coulthard posted the fastest lap time of 1:16.888 late in the session, one-tenth of a second faster than teammate Häkkinen. The Ferrari duo of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello, Trulli, Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen, the BAR teammates of Panis and Jacques Villeneuve, Heidfeld and Ralf Schumacher followed in the top ten. Irvine&#x27;s Jaguar had a fuel pump failure, causing it to lose fuel pressure on his out-lap; this forced him to stop at the side of the track and was prevented from setting a lap.

Lap times decreased during the second practice session due to the bright weather, which raised the track and ambient temperatures. Häkkinen set the day&#x27;s quickest lap, a 1:16.408; Coulthard was second-fastest. The Williams drivers were running quicker—Ralf Schumacher in third and Montoya in sixth—they were separated by the Ferrari duo of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello, in fourth and fifth respectively. They were ahead of Trulli, Heidfeld, Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi and Panis in positions seven to ten. Some drivers went off the track during the session. Luciano Burti&#x27;s Prost stopped on track with an engine failure after ten minutes. After 15 minutes, a throttle problem caused Barrichello to slow down and do a slow lap to the pit lane.

Despite the patchy clouds overhead, the third practice session was held in sunny weather. Michael Schumacher set the session&#x27;s fastest time with a lap of 1:16.308, almost three-tenths of a second faster than Ralf Schumacher. The McLaren drivers ran slower—Häkkinen ahead of Coulthard. Barrichello, Montoya, Villeneuve (who spun into the gravel at turn five with ten minutes remaining), Frentzen, Panis and Heidfeld occupied positions five to ten. 

It continued to be sunny for the final practice session, and although more cars left the track, there were no collisions. Ralf Schumacher was fastest at 1:15.355 in the final minute, almost four tenths of a second faster than teammate Montoya. Barrichello was third, with Häkkinen and Coulthard fourth and fifth respectively. Michael Schumacher in sixth had a minor hydraulic malfunction, thus limiting his running to only the final 15 minutes. Trulli, Frentzen (who had to stop his car with an engine failure), Panis and Räikkönen completed the top ten.

==Qualifying==
Each driver was limited to twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with the starting order determined by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, which required each driver to set a time within 107% of the fastest lap to qualify for the race. Qualifying took place in overcast conditions. Because the track was cold, no driver qualified until after 15 minutes. Michael Schumacher completed eight of his 12 laps, and took his seventh pole position in nine races in 2001. His time of 1:14.960 was the overall track lap record, set on his second timed attempt, after adjusting his car&#x27;s aerodynamics to extract more downforce. Ralf Schumacher qualified second, two tenths of a second slower, and held pole until Michael Schumacher lap. Montoya, third, made a car setup error between two runs and reported excessive oversteer. Barrichello was fourth with 11 minutes remaining after a power steering malfunction forced him to abort his second run, prompting his team to prepare a spare Ferrari for him if needed. Coulthard and Häkkinen were fifth and sixth, their best times six thousands of a second apart. Häkkinen could not accelerate out of the slow-speed corners without losing control of his car&#x27;s rear, and made an error mounting the kerbs at the Veedol chicane. Coulthard attempted to lap faster after modifying his McLaren&#x27;s front to try to strike the kerbs. On a lap with used front and new rear tires that caused oversteer, he spun into the edge of the gravel trap at the final Coca-Cola hairpin, while attempting to qualify on the second row. Yellow flags were waved and every driver had to slow. Trulli qualified seventh and felt he could have improved if not for slower cars and the yellow flag following Coulthard&#x27;s spin. His teammate Frentzen was eighth after his final quick lap moved him from 11th.

Räikkönen was ninth, but Coulthard&#x27;s spin cut his final run short. His teammate Heidfeld pushed too hard and ran wide into the first chicane, finishing tenth. Villeneuve qualified 11th as another driver ahead of him ran right into the chicane, losing time by going wide. Irvine, 12th, had severe understeer on his final run after setting a fast lap on a third set of tyres. Panis reported a lack of grip and could not match his lap times from practice, finishing 13th. Alesi, 14th, said that his car oversteered more than in practice due to increased track temperature, and encountered slower cars and yellow flags. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella, 15th, reported an improvement in his car on each run and had a decent chassis balance. Jaguar&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa took 16th with major understeer through turns three and four. Burti moved to teammate Alesi&#x27;s spare vehicle, which had to be reset due to a fuel pressure issue with his racing car. The car&#x27;s behaviour prevented him from lapping faster and he took 17th. The Arrows pair of Enrique Bernoldi and Jos Verstappen were 18th and 19th. Bernoldi noted a significant loss of grip as track temperature rose, while Verstappen noticed that his car lacked straightline speed compared to the morning sessions owing to a lack of grip. Fisichella&#x27;s teammate Jenson Button in 20th reported excessive understeer and no grip. Minardi drivers Fernando Alonso and Marques qualified at the back of the grid in 21st and 22nd. Marques briefly stopped on track at the Veedol chicane with a loss of drive, and Alonso aborted his third run when he ran wide and lost a set of tyres.
===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
On race morning, a 30-minute warm-up session was held in sunny and warm conditions. Teams concentrated on preparing their cars for the race, and some drivers used spare cars. Both Ferrari drivers continued their outstanding performance from qualifying; Barrichello achieved the quickest time of 1:18.209 with five minutes left; his teammate Michael Schumacher was second. Ralf Schumacher was just off Michael Schumacher&#x27;s pace in third, with Irvine, Coulthard, Montoya, early pacesetter Trulli, Häkkinen and the Sauber duo of Heidfeld and Räikkönen following in the top ten. No major incidents occurred during the session. Marques was affected by an engine and gearbox failure on his car.

==Race==
The race was held before between 100,000 and 150,000 spectators in the afternoon from 14:00 local time. The conditions were dry, warm and sunny for the race. The air temperature ranged from and the track temperature was between ; conditions were forecast to be constant, with a 20% chance of rain. Michael Schumacher, driving a spare Ferrari, came to a halt at the bottom of the hill at the Dunlop hairpin while on a reconnaissance lap due to a fuel pump failure. He commandeered a motor scooter back to the pit lane before it was closed and drove his racing car to the grid. Marques, from 22nd on the grid, stalled his Minardi car on the formation lap due to a launch control issue and had to start manually. &quot;Autosport&quot; wrote that race strategy would be concerned with limiting damage since inclement weather in the past two years and tyre degradation.

When the five lights went out to begin the race, Ralf Schumacher started faster than Michael Schumacher because of his car&#x27;s launch control system. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s launch control system was not correctly tuned, thus he veered to the right to put Ralf Schumacher towards the pit lane barrier, keeping the race lead into the Castrol-S chicane when the latter had to decelerate to prevent a collision. Montoya maintained his grid position of third. Behind the leading trio, Barrichello made a slow start due to a launch control issue, dropping from fourth to seventh. Marques ran wide into the gravel trap at the Castrol-S chicane but returned to the racecourse unscathed. Verstappen, who started 19th, had the best start in the spare Arrows car after his race car developed a fuel pressure issue, moving up five positions to 14th. Irvine overtook Villeneuve for 11th. Michael Schumacher led Ralf Schumacher by 1.4 seconds at the end of the first lap, followed by Montoya, Coulthard, Häkkinen, and Trulli.

Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher began to pull away from the rest of the field, with the former gaining an advantage over the latter due to his light fuel load. The race began processional as cars ran in formation with few overtakes occurring. Marques became the Grand Prix&#x27;s first retirement on lap eight, pulling over to the side of the track due to a gearbox failure caused by voltage fluctuations. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s advantage over Ralf Schumacher was 3.4 seconds at the start of lap 11.Around this time, Ralf Schumacher began to reduce the gap on Michael Schumacher with a string of fastest laps using his car&#x27;s powerful BMW engine. His older Michelin tyres began to warm up and increase his performance as his brother&#x27;s Bridgestone tyres wore out. The gap closed to under one second by the conclusion of lap 17. 

On the following lap, Michael Schumacher locked the rear brakes and drove wide to the outside of the track, into the downhill Dunlop hairpin. Ralf Schumacher tried to seize the race lead on the inside, but Michael Schumacher defended on the racing line. Over the next ten laps, Ralf Schumacher pressed Michael Schumacher, who was pushing hard to keep the race lead from his brother despite periodically sending his rear wheels off the track exiting the corners. Montoya was able to close in on the two cars by setting a series of fastest laps in an attempt to capitalise on their duel. On lap 22, Häkkinen ran wide on the grass and kerbing at the Veedol chicane after flat-spotting his front right tyre, causing a severe vibration. Two laps later, Panis spun into the Dunlop hairpin gravel trap due to an electronic malfunction in the gear change mechanism. On lap 27, Montoya set the race circuit lap record of 1:18.354, closing in on the battle for first and second place.

Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher, separated by four-tenths of a second, were the first of the leading drivers to make their first pit stops at the end of lap 28. Both drivers chose a two-stop strategy, while Michael Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Barrichello and the McLaren drivers followed a one-stop strategy. When Michael Schumacher realised his brother was making a pit stop, he turned right into the pit lane entrance, diving pit lane from the racing track at the last possible moment, crossing the white line and forcing him to cut in front of Ralf Schumacher, a legal manoeuvre. Swift work from the Ferrari crew allowed Michael Schumacher to stay ahead of Ralf Schumacher, who overshot his pit box and lost time as a result. As both drivers exited the pitlane, Ralf Schumacher cut to the left, illegally crossing over the white line designating the end of the pit lane straight to keep drivers on the inside of the circuit upon exiting since he was concentrating on Coulthard ahead of him. Montoya took the lead on lap 29 before making his first of two pit stops, returning to the track in fourth.

On lap 31, Ralf Schumacher passed Coulthard for second at the Dunlop hairpin, deciding that delaying the former would yield little benefit. Coulthard wanted to observe Ralf Schumacher close down on Michael Schumacher after seeing their earlier battle on television displays around the circuit. Bernoldi pulled over to the side of the track on the same lap, his car&#x27;s gearbox locked in fifth gear. Barrichello overtook Häkkinen at the chicane for fifth on lap 32. Montoya was battling Coulthard for third and attempted to overtake him at the Veedol chicane, but his brakes locked. He ran wide onto the grass at the turn on the next lap. He rejoined the track without losing any positions. Häkkinen made his only pit stop on the same lap, dropping to tenth. On lap 39, his teammate Coulthard made his only pit stop and returned to the track in sixth.

Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn alerted team principal Jean Todt that Ralf Schumacher had crossed the white line at the pit lane exit, which Todt reported to FIA race director Charlie Whiting by email. As Michael Schumacher increased his advantage over Ralf Schumacher because his new tyres provided him greater pace over his brother who was running worn tyres, the FIA stewards told the Williams team that Ralf Schumacher had received a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for crossing the white line at the pit exit. Williams brought Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane to serve his penalty at the end of lap 39, dropping him from second to fourth. This promoted his teammate Montoya to second and Barrichello to third; the penalty effectively eliminated Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s chances of winning the race. On lap 44, Barrichello made his only pit stop of the race from third. The stop lasted 10.3 seconds and he fell to fifth.

On lap 46, Trulli retired his car on the grass after the Bit curve turn due to a gearbox failure caused by an oil pressure problem. Two laps later, Alesi attempted to pass Heidfeld for twelfth place, and the two drivers collided lightly when Heidfeld did a defensive manoeuvre on Alesi. Frentzen spun his car after the Dunlop hairpin on lap 50 due to a traction control system failure and retired to the side of the track. Michael Schumacher and Montoya made their second pit stops at the conclusion of the lap. Both drivers remained in first and second places following their pit stops. Ralf Schumacher entered the pit lane for his second scheduled pit stop three laps later and rejoined in fourth, behind Coulthard. Heidfeld drove slowly to the pit lane due to his previous incident with Alesi, which bent a driveshaft, and was pushed into the garage on lap 56 to retire on safety grounds. Burti battled Button for 14th and overtook him on lap 56.

On lap 60, Barrichello made a mistake and skidded onto the grass, but he remained in fifth place. Verstappen went onto escape road after his engine failed on lap 62. Alesi attempted to brake later than Räikkönen, who had closed the inside line, into the Dunlop hairpin for 11th place on the penultimate lap, but spun into the gravel trap and retired. Michael Schumacher reduced his pace, and retained the lead for the rest of the race, securing his fifth victory of the nine races held thus far in the season and 49th overall, putting him two behind Alain Prost&#x27;s all-time win record of 51. Montoya registered his second race finish of the season, finishing second, 4.1 seconds behind Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was off the pace, finished third 20 seconds back. Ralf Schumacher was catching Coulthard until his pace dropped and he finished fourth. Barrichello finished fifth and Häkkinen completed the points-scorers in sixth. Irvine and De La Rosa finished seventh and eighth after Jaguar implemented a one-stop strategy. Villeneuve finished ninth, 1.7 seconds behind De La Rosa, unable to extract more performance from his tyres. Blistering tyres left Räikkönen in tenth. Benetton&#x27;s Fisichella and Button finished 11th and 13th, respectively; both drivers reported rear tyre handling issues. Burti was 12th after grass penetrated his car&#x27;s radiators when he ran off the track on lap 10 owing to blistering tyres from running in teammate Alesi&#x27;s slipstream and had them cleaned. Alonso finished 14th and was the final driver to finish despite late-race engine difficulties. Despite not finishing the race, Alesi was the last classified finisher.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media at the press conference held afterwards. Michael Schumacher said of his victory, &quot;We have had a superb weekend, we got pole position, we got the win, we had a nice race again together, Ralf and myself, until the stop and go, so it was quite an entertaining weekend.&quot; Montoya said he &quot;had pretty good luck&quot; and added that he was relieved to finish second after errors in the preceding two races. He stated that he was pushing after his second pit stop since his car could go fast and he was able to handle it in a way that allowed him to drive smoothly. Coulthard thought finishing third was his best possible result and that he would have finished fourth if Ralf Schumacher had not been penalised. He stated that he believed that a one-stop strategy from where he started the race was the best decision.

Following the race, Ralf Schumacher confronted his brother Michael in the scrutineering garage about being forced towards the pit lane barrier at the start. He would not discuss the start, but did issue a statement in which he expressed his disappointment in receiving a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for crossing the white line at the pit lane exit, which he believed may have lost him the race victory. Michael Schumacher contended that reaching the first corner in the lead was his first aim, and that his manoeuvre was permissible under the one-move rule. Coulthard agreed that the manoeuvre was legal, but he thought that requiring a driver to take evasive action or brake was not the right thing to do. BMW Motorsport director Gerhard Berger said he was unsurprised over the manoevure, calling it &quot;hard, but that&#x27;s racing.&quot; Ralf Schumacher said two days after the race that he would have performed the same manoeuvre as his brother at the start and was still upset with race officials about his penalty.

Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo called the race outcome &quot;one of Schumacher&#x27;s best ever wins with Ferrari&quot; and that victory against their primary rivals in their home nation of Germany was &quot;even more satisfying and motivating.&quot; Barrichello attributed his fifth-place finish to running a one-stop strategy and carrying a lot of fuel, which prevented him from racing with competitors close behind him, adding, &quot;It was just one of those days which didn&#x27;t work out right.&quot; Häkkinen expressed disappointment with his sixth-place finish, claiming that tyre vibration and early pitting cost him spots. McLaren team principal Ron Dennis defended Häkkinen, stating the driver slowed due to a tyre issue and resulting vibrations, preventing him from finishing fourth. 

The race result saw Michael Schumacher extend his World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead with 68 points. Coulthard was second with 44 points, 18 ahead of Barrichello in third, and 19 ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fourth. Montoya&#x27;s second-place finish moved him from eleventh to fifth. With eight races remaining in the season, Ferrari maintained their World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead with 94 points, McLaren remained second with 53 points, and Williams remained third with 37 points.

<text>The 2001 French Grand Prix (officially the Mobil 1 Grand Prix de France) was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, Magny-Cours, France on 1 July 2001 before a crowd of 120,717 people. It was the tenth race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 51st French Grand Prix as part of the series. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the 72-lap race starting from second position. Ralf Schumacher finished second for the Williams team with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari.

Ralf Schumacher led the opening 23 laps before he made his first pit stop and Michael Schumacher assumed the lead after the first round of pit stops. His nearest championship rival David Coulthard of the McLaren outfit served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 32 for an earlier transgression of speeding at the pit lane exit. Michael Schumacher pulled away from the slower car of Ralf Schumacher who baulked his teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, until his second pit stop on the 44th lap. Montoya led laps 46 to 50 before he ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, who maintained it to take his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career.

The result enabled Michael Schumacher to increase his Drivers&#x27; Championship lead over Coulthard in second to 31 points. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s second-place finish moved him past Barrichello for third. Although he retired from the event, Montoya kept fifth. Ferrari further extended their Constructors&#x27; Championship advantage to 52 points over the McLaren team in second. Williams remained in third place with 43 points while Sauber broke its tie with Jordan to move into a clear fourth with seven rounds left in the season.

==Background==

The 2001 French Grand Prix was the tenth of seventeen scheduled single seater races of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 51st running of the event as part of the series. It took place at the fifteen-turn Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours in the commune of Magny-Cours, Burgundy on 1 July 2001. The layout of the circuit provided a mixture of corners taken at low and high speeds with four long and short straights. It had a flat and smooth racing surface that had no single deformation around the track to disrupt the stability of the cars and the series&#x27; two tyre suppliers Bridgestone and Michelin brought soft compound tyres to maximise mechanical grip.

Before the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 68 points ahead of McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard (44 points) in second. Rubens Barrichello (26 points) in the second Ferrari was third and Williams driver Ralf Schumacher in fourth was one point behind in the battle for the position. The other Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya completed the top five in the standings with 12 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship Ferrari led with 94 points, with a 41-point gap over their nearest rivals McLaren in second. With 37 points, Williams were in third position and Sauber (15 points) and Jordan (13 points) contended for fourth place.

In preparation for the Grand Prix, the Ferrari team tested its chassis, the F2001, the only constructor to do so. The outfit conducted a six-hour and 45-minute shakedown session on 28 June at the Fiorano Circuit with their test driver, Luca Badoer, who drove to test the functionality of the car electrical system and also concentrated on launch control system practice starts. After an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris on 27 June 2001, all of the eleven teams unanimously agreed that starting from this event, any driver who stalled his car on the grid for the formation lap would be barred from using the spare car. The rule was revised to state that any switch into the spare car could only be undertaken fifteen seconds before the commencement of the formation lap and it would avoid any driver incurring a pit lane start.

Coulthard had won the 2000 French Grand Prix and spoke of his anticipation that McLaren would be within four-tenths of a second of Ferrari depending on the amount of tyre degradation, &quot;So, in qualifying, again, unless the tyre that we have available to us works well on our car there, I don&#x27;t think we have something in the set-up that we can change. It&#x27;s probably something a bit more fundamental.&quot; He said that he did not want to be drawn into discussion over the Drivers&#x27; Championship and sought to extract his best performance over the rest of the season, &quot; I concentrate on the future because you can&#x27;t change the past. What we can influence is the future and we won&#x27;t be affected by the situation that we are in.&quot; Michael Schumacher stated his acknowledgement that Coulthard was his main rival for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and took a race-by-race approach, &quot;The year is long and there are still eight races to go and I still have to calculate for David in particular. McLaren could still be very strong in Magny-Cours&quot;

A total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructors) entered two drivers each for the event. Some teams made modifications to their cars for the race. The Renault engine manufacturer débuted a revised specification of its V10 power unit in the Benetton B201s of Giancarlo Fisichella and Jenson Button. This however did not increase the overall top speed of the cars and they remained slow throughout the race meeting. All of the primary teams did not bring any major aerodynamic improvements to the Magny-Cours track as the Prost outfit installed revised its suspension geometry and modified the bodywork of the AP04 chassis. The Sauber team mounted a new front wing on the C20 that featured an V-shaped wing to support it and the British American Racing (BAR) squad introduced a new rear suspension design that was developed by its partner Honda on Olivier Panis&#x27; 003 chassis.

==Practice==
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final practice sessions on Saturday morning ran for 45 minutes. Weather conditions were hot and clear for the two practice sessions on Friday. In the first practice session, McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen was fastest with a lap of 1 minute and 15.889 seconds, 0.155 seconds faster than Michael Schumacher in second. Coulthard and Barrichello were third and fourth, with the Williams of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya fifth and sixth. Jarno Trulli of the Jordan team, Panis, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve rounded out the session&#x27;s top ten drivers. Several drivers spun on the dusty track and into the gravel traps during the session. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s running ended early due to a water leak that was possibly caused by a damaged pipe in the car&#x27;s sidepod from hitting debris off Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s Sauber.

Coulthard was quicker in the second practice session and recorded the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1 minute and 14.935 seconds. Eddie Irvine had increased pace in his Jaguar and he went second and Villeneuve was third. Fourth was Häkkinen and the Williams pair of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya placed fifth and sixth. Michael Schumacher, Jaguar&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa, Trulli and Barrichello were in positions seven to ten. Jos Verstappen&#x27;s engine failed in his Arrows A22 on the pit lane straight and he took over his teammate Enrique Bernoldi&#x27;s Arrows car for the final 20 minutes of the session. An unstable rear caused Panis to pirouette into the gravel trap at the Adelaide hairpin. As Räikkönen exited the pit lane, the front wing on his car detached, causing him to oversteer through the gravel trap at Estoril corner and shattering the front wing.

It continued to be hot and clear for Saturday morning&#x27;s two practice sessions. Michael Schumacher increased the performance of his car and was fastest in the third practice session with a lap of 1 minute and 13.729 seconds. He was 0.406 seconds clear of Coulthard in second and third was Ralf Schumacher. Barrichello was fourth-fastest, ahead of Montoya and Trulli in fifth and sixth places. Frentzen, Panis, Villeneuve and Räikkönen followed in the top ten. No incidents were reported during the session although Häkkinen did not record a timed lap. Although he did not improve his lap time Michael Schumacher remained quickest in the fourth practice session, with Ralf Schumacher in second. The two McLarens were third and fourth – Coulthard ahead of Häkkinen – with Trulli improving to fifth and Barrichello fell to sixth. Montoya was seventh-fastest, Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld placed eighth, Irvine came ninth and Räikkönen duplicated his third practice session result in tenth ahead of qualifying.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver to set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Weather conditions for qualifying were hot and sunny. Ralf Schumacher twice surpassed the qualifying track record held by the 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell to claim the first pole position of his career with a 1-minute and 12.989 seconds lap on his second timed lap. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Michael Schumacher who was ten-thousandths of a second slower. He was distracted by the Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn over the radio and was later baulked by Trulli on his third timed lap. Coulthard qualified third on his fourth timed run with three minutes left and spoke of his feeling he could have improved further as he ran over gravel scattered by Luciano Burti&#x27;s Prost at turn 13 causing him to make a minor mistake. His teammate Häkkinen had minor engine vibrations and an error on his final timed lap put him fourth. Trulli and Frentzen took fifth and seventh for the Jordan team. Trulli was pleased with the balance of his car and later apologised to Michael Schumacher for slowing the Ferrari driver while Frentzen was baulked by Panis. They were separated by Montoya&#x27;s slower Williams who was pleased with how his car felt but was annoyed with Alesi who blocked Montoya during his last timed lap towards its conclusion.

A handling balance problem that made his car anxious under braking and launched over the kerbs at the turn 13/14 chicane restricted Barrichello to eighth. Heidfeld made minor adjustments to improve the vehicle&#x27;s balance and took ninth. Villeneuve used the first half an hour to adjust his front and rear flaps and took tenth, although he lost time through turn one. Panis took 11th after heavy traffic slowed his final timed lap. Irvine, 12th, spun twice during the session and Räikkönen in 13th expressed disappointment of the balance of his car. 14th-placed De La Rosa was kept from the circuit due to an electrical fault at his part of the garage and engine overheating and driver errors affected his on-track running. Burti&#x27;s car was altered at midday and pirouetted his car on his third timed lap as he qualified 15th. Fisichella and Button of the Benetton outfit took 16th and 17th: Button was prevented from setting a faster lap because he forgot to change the setting of his differential exiting Estroil corner because he was too focused on the lap and he only remembered to alter the differential setting when he got to the Adelaide hairpin. Verstappen in 18th could not adapt the Arrows A22 to the track and he was ahead of 19th-placed Alesi spun at high-speed leaving the Imola chicane. Bernoldi was unable to extract additional speed from his car and took 20th. The two Minardis qualified at the rear of the field in 21st and 22nd places: Fernando Alonso was slowed on his final timed lap by Bernoldi, and his teammate Tarso Marques had a large amount of understeer that affected the handling of his chassis, which could not be rectified.

===Post-qualifying===

At the pre-race drivers meeting on Saturday evening, the drivers deliberated the best method to avoid potential crashes at the exit of the pit lane, which was changed at the request of all drivers for the 2001 race, from the exit of the Estoril turn to its entry.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

The drivers took to the track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session in warm and dry weather conditions. All drivers fine-tuned their race set-ups against the weather conditions of the time, undertook laps in their spare cars and Barrichello changed the setting of his rear wing. Although he spun towards the conclusion of the session, Häkkinen drove better than in qualifying and he was fastest with a lap of 1 minute and 15.428 seconds, which was one-thousands of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second. Barrichello&#x27;s car was corrected from having an unbalanced car with a change of electronic settings after a technical meeting and he placed third and Coulthard was fourth. Fifth was Trulli, Räikkönen placed sixth and Panis came seventh. De La Rosa, Heidfeld and Irvine were in positions eight to ten going into the race.

==Race==
The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time. Weather conditions at the start were hot and clear. The air temperature ranged between and the track temperature was from . The hot weather increased the possibility of mechanical attrition. Approximately 120,717 people attended the event. A two-stop strategy was the standard for the French Grand Prix and every pit stop took less time because of pit lane layout. Häkkinen could not get off the grid at the start of the formation lap because an assembled component in his car&#x27;s gearbox was incorrectly fitted. His car was pushed back into the pit lane where the mechanics were unable to rectify the problem and Häkkinen did not take the start. De la Rosa&#x27;s throttle failed during the formation lap and drove back to the pit lane and started one lap behind the rest of the field. When the five red flags extinguished to signal the start of the race, Ralf Schumacher made a brisk start to maintain his pole position advantage going into the first corner and retained despite an error at the Adelaide hairpin. Michael Schumacher in second was slower off the line due to a minor glitch between the launch control system and clutch that was changed after the warm-up session though he held off Coultard on the first lap.

Barrichello had a fast gateway, rising from eighth to fifth by the end of the first lap. Räikkönen moved up four positions over the same distance. Montoya passed Trulli and the manoeuvre caused the latter to lose momentum and allow Barrichello to overtake him. At the end of the first lap, Ralf Schumacher led by 0.3 seconds from Michael Schumacher, who was in turn was followed by Coulthard, Montoya, Barrichello, Trulli, Frentzen, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, Heidfeld, Irvine, Panis, Burti, Verstappen, Bernoldi, Fisichella, Button, Alesi, Marques and Alonso. Ralf Schumacher extended his advantage to three-tenths of a second from Michael Schumacher with Coulthard close behind. Further down the field Panis passed Irvine to take over eleventh position, while Fisichella was overtaken by teammate Button for 16th. Villeneuve in eighth became the Grand Prix&#x27;s first retirement when his engine lost power and he went into the gravel trap at Estroil corner on lap six. At the front of the field, Ralf Schumacher, driving with an unbalanced car that caused him to lock his tyres into the Adelaide hairpin, increased his lead over Michael Schumacher to 1.8 seconds by the 17th lap, who in turn, was 1.7 seconds in front of Coulthard in third. Montoya was a further 1.7 seconds adrift in fourth and he maintained a consistent gap ahead of Barrichello in fifth.

That lap, Bernoldi retired with an engine failure. Irvine was challenging Panis for ninth though he was not able to pass and he fell back slightly before the first round of pit stops. In the meantime, the top five drivers were covered by a gap of ten seconds as all of them lapped in the 1 minute and 16 second range and began to lap slower drivers for the first time. Barrichello was the first lead driver to make a pit stop on the 21st lap. He rejoined the track in seventh place. That lap, Irvine overtook Panis around the inside at Lycee corner for ninth. Three laps later, Ralf Schumacher made his first pit stop from the lead. His crew had trouble fitting the car&#x27;s right-rear tyre because Ralf Schumacher engaged first gear before the mechanic fitted it. He lost 2.8 seconds and returned to the circuit in fourth. Michael Schumacher led the 26th lap and increased his pace before his own stop for fuel, which took 7.7 seconds. He emerged in third, ahead of Ralf Schumacher but behind Coulthard and Montoya. Montoya led the next three laps as Michael Schumacher began to draw closer to him. On lap 30, Montoya made his first pit stop and he rejoined the track in fifth place.

After the pit stops, Michael Schumacher led Ralf Schumacher by 7.2 seconds, who in turn, was 1.1 seconds ahead of the third-placed Coulthard. Barrichello was another two seconds behind in fourth and the rest of the top six was completed by Montoya and Trulli. On lap 31, the stewards informed the McLaren team that Coulthard had incurred a ten-second stop-and-go penalty because he was observed going above the pit lane speed limit because he disengaged his pit lane speed limiter before crossing the white line denoting the pit lane exit. He took the penalty on the following lap. Coulthard lost 26.8 seconds and he fell from third to fifth. On lap 35, Verstappen passed Alonso to move into 16th. Barrichello made his second pit stop one lap later in Ferrari&#x27;s aim to get him in clean air and move past Ralf Schumacher. He returned in fourth place. As Michael Schumacher continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher, it became apparent that the latter was delaying his teammate Montoya. The Williams team attempted to order Ralf Schumacher to cede second place to Montoya though he did not do so because of radio communication problems with his earpiece and Montoya lost time.

At the end of lap 42, Irvine drew to the right of Frentzen and out-braked him at the Imola chicane as Frentzen cut the corner to retain eighth. Irvine gesticulated at the Jaguar gantry on the pit lane to signal that Frentzen performed an illegal manoeuvre. Frentzen then ceded the position to Irvine to avoid incurring a penalty. On lap 44, the technical director of the Williams team Patrick Head went to his outfit&#x27;s gantry on the pit wall to instruct Ralf Schumacher to enter the pit lane earlier than scheduled. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop for tyres on the next lap and rejoined the circuit in second place, three seconds behind Montoya, who assumed the lead. Montoya increased his pace to hold a five-second advantage when he entered the pit lane for his second scheduled stop on the 50th lap. He emerged in fourth position, ahead of Ralf Schumacher as Michael Schumacher returned to the lead. Montoya pulled off to the side of the track with smoke bellowing from his engine on lap 53, ending his race. Barrichello entered the pit lane for his third and final stop on the next lap. It took 7.7 seconds and he emerged in third position. On lap 56, Irvine stopped on the grass at the right-hand side of the Adelaide hairpin with a pneumatic valve system failure.

Coulthard drew close to Barrichello at the Adelaide hairpin on lap 58 after the latter ran wide. He dropped back from Barrichello through Estroil corner three laps later. Button pirouetted through 720 degrees into the gravel trap at the Adelaide hairpin because he pushed too hard and had oversteer on the 63rd lap though he continued. He consequently had too deal with heavy vibrations at high speeds from flat-spotting a tyre after locking the wheels for a long period of time under braking. Further down the field, de la Rosa overtook Alonso for 15th position, and Alonso was called into the pit lane to retire with suspected engine problems located on the Minardi telemetry equipment. On lap 68, Coulthard to pass Barrichello on the left-hand side of the track on the run to the Adelaide hairpin while the two lapped Alesi&#x27;s slower car though he could not complete the manoeuvre as Barrichello accelerated faster than him at the corner. On lap 71, an oversteer and a rear tyre lock sent Button into a spin through 180 degrees into a gravel trap and retired with a fuel pressure pick-up problem. Upfront, Michael Schumacher was told over the radio to reduce his pace to avoid excessive strain on his car, and he maintained the lead to take his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career. Ralf Schumacher was 10.399 seconds behind in second and Barrichello completed the podium finishers in third. Off the podium, Coulthard finished fourth, Trulli fifth and Heidfeld completed the points-scoring positions in sixth.

=== Post-race ===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Michael Schumacher said he was delighted to take the 50th victory of his career though he explained his priority was to win the race and focus on securing the Drivers&#x27; Championship, &quot;People seem to misunderstand my feeling about these statistics – I always said they were second priority but they do mean something to me.&quot; Ralf Schumacher expressed his happiness to finish second after his pit stop fumble, &quot;If I would have come out in front of Michael I think it would have been difficult to hold him behind me. I am actually happy to sit here in second today because it was a disaster and really difficult to drive.&quot; Barrichello expressed his surprise over finishing in third place, &quot; Qualifying was horrible for me, I never really knew what was going on. The car was oversteering in some places, understeering in other places. This morning the car felt a lot better and I was going really well on my first stint, saving a lot of fuel at that time, and Ross came on the radio and said &#x27;would you like to try a three stop&#x27; and I said &#x27;I think so, it&#x27;s a good idea, because then I can be quick on the track the whole time and by doing stops I might only finish in front of the Jordans, so let&#x27;s try.&#x27;&quot;

Coulthard learned about his ten-second stop-and-go penalty over the radio and admitted his surprise and disappointment over incurring it as he believed he had exited the pit lane, &quot;The fact is the penalty for speeding cost me points. I was just a bit too keen with the button. It has cost me dearly&quot;, and, &quot;I knew I had a penalty, at first I didn&#x27;t know what for. Then the team explained it to me. I wasn&#x27;t gutted because you never know what can happen during the rest of the race. I knew I had to keep pushing.&quot; Häkkinen said he felt nothing about failing to start the race, &quot;If I&#x27;d led the race and then retired, there would have been something to feel. But as it is, there is nothing. I know how to win races and am certain I will again in the future.&quot; According to Trulli, who finished in fifth, the Jordan team required additional work to increase the EJ11&#x27;s pace, &quot;I knew that today was going to be a good chance to score points and I kept pushing hard. The car felt perfect from the beginning and the lap times were good but it is difficult to keep close to the three top teams.&quot;

The result enabled Michael Schumacher (on 78 points) to increase his Drivers&#x27; Championship lead over Coulthard in second to 31 points. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s second-place finish moved him past Barrichello for third. Montoya remained in fifth place despite he retirement. Ferrari further extended its advantage in the Constructors&#x27; Championship to 52 points over the McLaren team in second. Williams remained in third place with 43 points while Heidfeld&#x27;s sixth-place finish meant Sauber broke its tie with Jordan to move into a clear fourth position with seven rounds left in the season.

<text>The 2001 British Grand Prix (formally the LIV Foster&#x27;s British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 15 July 2001 at the Silverstone Circuit, England, United Kingdom. It was the 11th of 17 rounds in the 2001 Formula One World Championship and was the 52nd time that the British Grand Prix had been included in the championship since 1950. McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen won the 60-lap race after starting second. The Ferrari duo of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello finished in second and third, respectively.

Heading into the Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard while Ferrari led McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Schumacher secured pole position after setting the fastest lap time in the one-hour qualifying session, with Häkkinen starting second. He led the first four laps before running wide at Copse corner, allowing Häkkinen to take the race lead. Häkkinen led throughout the majority of the race, except for the first round of pit stops, when he lost it to Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya for three laps, and won his first race since the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix as well as his 19th overall. Schumacher finished 33.6 seconds behind in second.

The Grand Prix result increased Schumacher&#x27;s World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead to points over Coulthard, who retired on lap three due to a suspension failure caused by a collision with Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli. Ferrari maintained a 56-point lead over McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, while Williams remained third with six races left in the season.

==Background==
The 2001 British Grand Prix was the 11th of 17 Formula One races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship, held on 15 July 2001, at the Silverstone Circuit in England, United Kingdom. It was the 52nd British Grand Prix in the Formula One World Championship, which began in . Before the race, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 78 points, ahead of McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard on 47 points in second and Williams&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher (30). Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 30 points and Williams&#x27;s Juan Pablo Montoya was fifth on 12 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 108 points, 52 ahead of the second-placed McLaren. Williams were third with 43 points. Sauber were fourth with 16 points, one point ahead of Jordan in fifth.

After heavy rain affected the previous year&#x27;s British Grand Prix, necessitating the closure of Silverstone&#x27;s car parks, forcing spectators to walk long distances to attend the event, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s regulatory body) awarded the Motor Sports Association, the Grand Prix organisers, a reprieve after pledging to remedy the flaws, and the next British Grand Prix was tentatively scheduled for 13 May 2001. Although FIA president Max Mosley threatened to cancel the race due to Silverstone&#x27;s poor facilities, a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Seville, Spain on 4 October 2000 saw it awarded a July date after the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club, Silverstone&#x27;s proprietors, were assessed to have improved the track; the organisers agreed to move the race from July to May to accommodate the British Grand Prix, following a request by Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone.

After the on 1 July, teams evaluated car components, settings, electronics and tyres at various European racing tracks from 3 to 6 July in preparation for the British Grand Prix. The Jordan, McLaren, Sauber, British American Racing (BAR) and Jaguar teams tested for four days at Italy&#x27;s Monza Circuit. Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine withdrew early from testing due to a reoccurring pain in the upper part of his cervical spine he had been suffering since June and was replaced by British Formula Three driver André Lotterer from the afternoon of the second day. The Benetton and Williams teams tested for four days at Spain&#x27;s Circuit de Barcelona. Ferrari went to Italy&#x27;s Mugello Circuit before heading to their private testing facility, the Fiorano Circuit, for three days, joined later on by BAR and Minardi. Luca Badoer spent two days at Fiorano testing the F2001&#x27;s electronic launch control system and practice standing starts for the Silverstone race. Arrows held three days of straight-line aerodynamic car configuration tests with former Indy Lights driver Jonny Kane at Italy&#x27;s Vairano circuit, while Williams did the same for three days at France&#x27;s Lurcy-Lévis track.

Michael Schumacher, the bookmakers&#x27; pre-race favourite for the win, had the chance to tie Alain Prost&#x27;s all-time record of 51 career victories at Silverstone. He stated that he was not prioritising statistics, but rather taking a race-by-race approach to achieving the &quot;maximum possible&quot; for both championships. Coulthard had won the British Grand Prix twice in succession in 1999 and 2000 and said he wanted to become the first driver to win the race three years running since Jim Clark in 1964. He added &quot;I really need to win the British GP this year&quot; because it would return him to championship contention and prevent Michael Schumacher from attaining an unassailable points advantage after securing one podium result in the previous four races.

Eleven two-driver teams competed, each representing a different constructor, with no changes to the entry list from the previous race. Lotterer was on standby to replace the injured Irvine for the Grand Prix, but the latter entered the event. Some teams modified their cars for the race. Ferrari reused a qualifying-spec engine and modified the F2001&#x27;s lower front wing endplates slightly. McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen drove a qualifying-specification car for the race that had no end side chimneys to maximise the MP4-16 car&#x27;s drag co-efficiency. Benetton had launch control for the first time. Jaguar added a revised floor and new bargeboards, while McLaren made minor aerodynamic changes, including new front brake ducts. Sauber had brought new brake ducts and revised their bargeboards. Williams also introduced redesigned bargeboards for the event and increased cooling by reducing the engine cover&#x27;s rear edge above the rear suspension. Prost switched to an older undertray for Jean Alesi&#x27;s car, which he preferred over the new version débuted for the race.. BAR unveiled Honda-built rear suspensions with carbon fibre pushrods, while Jordan debuted a new rear wing. Arrows debuted new brake ducts with the middle part moved forwards to improve the A22 car&#x27;s cooling. Minardi introduced no new components to their car because it was focused on building a new titanium gearbox.

==Practice==
The race was preceded by four practice sessions, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The first session, held on Friday morning, was dry and cloudy. Michael Schumacher lapped fastest at 1:23.619 after 46 minutes, 0.786 seconds faster than teammate Barrichello in second. Häkkinen, Coulthard. Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Irvine, the BAR duo Olivier Panis and Jacques Villeneuve, Frentzen&#x27;s teammate Jarno Trulli and Kimi Räikkönen (Sauber) were in positions three to ten. Räikkönen spun at Abbey corner but continued. Montoya spun into Vale corner after pushing hard with ten minutes left but continued. His Williams teammate Ralf Schumacher lost the rear of his car at the Bridge turn but was able to continue. Pedro de la Rosa stopped his Jaguar in the centre of the track with a fuel supply issue and set no lap times in the session.

The second session began sunny and windy, but heavy clouds formed low around Silverstone, and rain fell in the final ten minutes, creating a slippery track surface that slowed drivers. Häkkinen set the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:22.827 with 14 minutes left, 0.067 seconds quicker than teammate Coulthard. The Ferrari pair of Barrichello and Michael Schumacher were third and fourth. Frentzen&#x27;s car had an oil leak at the start of the session but duplicated his first-session result in fifth. Heidfeld, De La Rosa, Ralf Schumacher, Trulli and Räikkönen completed the top ten. Villeneuve lost control of his car&#x27;s rear at Copse Corner, after the start/finish straight, owing to a front suspension failure, spun 360 degrees and damaged the front wing endplates. Fernando Alonso spun at Copse turn but returned to the pit lane with damage to the rear of his Minardi car. He spun again when he mounted the kerb driving onto the Hangar straight and spun into the grass. Alonso&#x27;s undertray was damaged, and was unable to continue driving because the sodden grass prevented him from gaining traction.
It rained on the circuit during the third practice session before clearing up later, but it was cold. It took 15 minutes before cars circulated the track, and several drivers lost control of their cars on the sodden track surface; a large amount of spray was lifted from the circuit, reducing visibility. Michael Schumacher led with a lap of 1:31.430, followed by Frentzen, the McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard, Barrichello, Heidfeld, Trulli, Ralf Schumacher, Panis and Montoya. After 11 minutes, Villeneuve failed to set a lap owing to a gearbox issue, causing him to halt on the grass near the pit lane exit. Irvine had to drive slowly to the pit lane with a hydraulic throttle failure on his R2 car.

More rain fell between the third and fourth practice sessions, preventing most drivers from improving their lap times, which were more than four seconds slower than the previous session, and causing several to slide off the circuit. The rain later eased off slightly and the circuit dried slowly with standing water becoming less prevalent. Michael Schumacher remained fastest, ahead of Frentzen, Häkkinen, Coulthard, Barrichello, Heidfeld, Trulli, Räikkönen (who avoided hitting a hare that had breached circuit perimeters), Panis and Ralf Schumacher in positions two to ten. Tarso Marques was the only driver who did not set a lap time in the session when he lost control of his Minardi car while scrubbing his tyres and spun backwards into the gravel trap at Abbey chicane.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by their fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver to set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. About an hour before qualifying, the rain ceased and it became sunny. The track swiftly dried, but no driver went onto it for the first 24 minutes because nobody wanted to begin drying the racing line; Competitors waited for the track temperatures to rise for the circuit to be suitably dry. Michelin-shod teams underperformed Bridgestone-shod squads because their tyres performed less well in colder weather. Lap times progressively got faster during qualifying, and every driver eclipsed the 2000 pole lap. On his third run, Michael Schumacher took the 40th pole position of his career and his eighth in 11 races in 2001, with a qualifying lap record of 1:20.477 with seven minutes left, despite running slightly wide at Stowe corner. He noted that qualifying was challenging for him, and he used his first two quick laps to fine-tune his car&#x27;s set-up because of the lack of dry track running during Saturday practice. Häkkinen took second, 0.082 seconds behind Michael Schumacher, and held pole until the latter&#x27;s quickest lap. He lost time after being held up by a Benetton car on his final quick run, believing he lost the chance to take pole position. Coulthard took third and said he could not find the best balance for his McLaren before qualifying ended due to changing track conditions. Trulli qualified fourth despite hitting a kerb at the exit of Becketts corner on his fourth run, damaging his front-left suspension pushrod. He slowed, then stopped at the side of the track. His Jordan teammate Frentzen secured fifth, reporting no problems with his car. Barrichello was demoted to sixth in the final minutes. He spent his first two runs on his set-up, and failed to lap faster on his fourth run because he was twice blocked by Arrows&#x27;s Enrique Bernoldi (who was on an in-lap). Räikkönen and Heidfeld took seventh and ninth respectively for Sauber; Räikkönen was pleased with seventh after making minor tweaks to the C20 chassis&#x27;s handling balance. Ralf Schumacher and both McLarens were driving slowly through Luffield corner, prompting Heidfeld to run across an inside kerb and onto grass, losing Heidfeld three-tenths of a second.

Montoya separated the Sauber drivers; he bent a front suspension push-rod arm on his first run after clipping the kerb at the exit of Becketts early in qualifying, and he took over Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s spare car setup for the rest of qualifying. Ralf Schumacher, tenth, expressed disappointment that his quickest lap was set on his second run and was slowed by traffic as track conditions improved. Panis came 11th and said that his car&#x27;s balance was good, although he experienced an accelerator pedal sensor problem on his first lap, which his team promptly resolved. Villeneuve, 12th, had an engine problem on his first run and drove the spare BAR car until his race car was fixed. He was ahead of the faster Jaguar of De La Rosa, who reported no issues. Alesi, 14th, found the old undertray on his Prost AP04 car gave him more consistent handling and he made minor setup changes. Irvine qualified 15th but had a front-left suspension pushrod failure, forcing him to drive the spare Jaguar set up for De La Rosa. Prost&#x27;s Luciano Burti had a large amount of understeer, leaving him 16th. Verstappen gradually improved his car throughout qualifying and secured 17th; his teammate Bernoldi took 20th and had a throttle issue on his first run which affected his momentum and was held up by Verstappen on his final run. The two Arrows were separated by the Benettons of Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella in 18th and 19th who lacked grip in the high-speed corners; Traffic prevented Button from lapping faster and Fisichella reported understeer and poor grip. Alonso completed the starting order in 21st. His teammate Marques failed to set a lap within 107% of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s pole time and was barred from starting the race after Minardi&#x27;s appeal on his behalf was rejected by the stewards because there were &quot;no exceptional circumstances&quot; to explain his qualifying performance. Marques had a throttle problem with his car, and with the backup car set up for Alonso, there was no time to modify the settings so Marques could use it.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
On race morning, teams had a 30-minute warm-up session to fine-tune their cars for the race in dry and partly sunny conditions.Some drivers used both their team&#x27;s spare and racing cars. Coulthard set the fastest lap of 1:22.994 in the final three minutes of warm-up. He was 0.182 seconds faster than second-placed Trulli. Häkkinen was third, with early pace setter Frentzen fourth. Michael Schumacher, Panis, Räikkönen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello and Irvine followed in the top ten. Except for Heidfeld losing control of his car over a bump into Stowe corner and going into the gravel trap eleven minutes in, the session was generally incident-free. Heidfeld was able to return to the pit lane.

==Race==
At 13:00 local time, the race began in front of 100,000 to 120,000 spectators. The weather before the event was dry but overcast; the air temperature was between , and the track temperature was between . When the red lights went out to begin the race, Michael Schumacher maintained his race lead over Häkkinen with a clean start into Copse turn, despite his car being heavier due to a fuel load of . Coulthard was driving on the inside line into Copse, with his car angled towards the centre of the track. Trulli drove onto the inside line, and pulled alongside Coulthard into the first curve, colliding with Coulthard&#x27;s car&#x27;s rear. Both drivers spun with Trulli going into the gravel trap on the outside at Copse turn, and Coulthard veering right across the grass verge and onto the pit lane exit road. Coulthard was able to continue driving despite significant damage to his diffuser and undertray. He fell to 18th, while Trulli retired from the race. Villeneuve was unable to change into a higher gear because his automatic upshifting system failed, forcing him to start manually. He then drove in a gear he did not plan to drive in, hit his brakes hard, locking his front wheels, rendering him unable to steer, and collided with teammate Panis, who retired from the race after entering the gravel trap at Copse next to Trulli&#x27;s car. Villeneuve sustained front wing, sidepod and floor damage to his car.

Montoya moved from tenth to third by the conclusion of the opening lap when Frentzen and Barrichello tried to avoid the Coulthard-Trulli accident. His teammate Ralf Schumacher gained five positions over the same distance, aided by his car&#x27;s powerful launch control system and three cars ahead of him going off the track. Frentzen, however, made a poor start and lost three positions before the first lap ended. Verstappen made the best start in the field, moving from 17th to 11th, while Alesi gained four positions. Michael Schumacher led by 0.2 seconds over Häkkinen after the first lap, followed by Montoya, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher and Räikkönen. Michael Schumacher maintained a modest gap over Häkkinen, who began challenging for the lead. Häkkinen set the race&#x27;s fastest lap so far on the third lap – a 1:25.861 – to close the gap to Michael Schumacher to one-tenth of a second. Although McLaren were confident that Coulthard could safely stay on the track, his right rear suspension collapsed on that lap due to his earlier accident with Trulli. He spun into the gravel trap at Priory corner, ending his race. Verstappen passed Villeneuve and Alesi for ninth on lap four, as Fisichella went into the gravel trap at Copse turn on that lap, rejoining behind Alonso. 

Michael Schumacher looked to lose control of his car at the exit to Copse corner, losing him speed. This enabled Häkkinen to take the lead at Maggots turn at the beginning of lap five; Due to Schumacher&#x27;s car setup difficulty, Häkkinen began to draw away from him at roughly two seconds each lap. Burti became the Grand Prix&#x27;s fourth retirement when his engine failed on lap seven and spilt oil at Woodcote ciorner, leading the marshals to wave the red and yellow striped warning flag. He retired after stopping his car on the start-finish straight next to the pit lane barrier, with smoke billowing from it. As Häkkinen extended his lead, Montoya reduced the margin to Michael Schumacher to 1.6 seconds by lap 10. Villeneuve overtook Alesi into Stowe corner for tenth on lap 11. By lap 15, Montoya continued to close up to Michael Schumacher and slipstreamed past the Ferrari driver on the inside to take second place at the end of the start-finish straight, three laps later, heading into Stowe turn. Montoya pulled away from Michael Schumacher.

By lap 20, Häkkinen led Montoya by 25.2 seconds, with Michael Schumacher 4.5 seconds behind. Barrichello was 10.9 seconds behind his teammate and was being chased down by Ralf Schumacher in fifth. Räikkönen had been battling Ralf Schumacher for fifth and was the first driver to make a pit stop on the next lap. He rejoined the race in tenth. The McLaren and Ferrari teams had contrasting strategies: the McLaren team planned a two-stop strategy, while the Ferrari team planned one pit stop. Ferrari suspected Häkkinen would be carrying a small load at the start of the race, whereas McLaren hoped Häkkinen would pass Michael Schumacher and delay him long enough for Coulthard to challenge him at the appropriate time. As he approached slower cars, Häkkinen was summoned to the pit lane by his team to make his first pit stop from the race lead on the same lap. He returned to the circuit behind Montoya but ahead of Michael Schumacher. Heidfeld also had a pit stop on the same lap, exiting in tenth. Montoya led the following three laps before making his first pit stop on lap 25, put under pressure by Häkkinen, who reclaimed the race lead. Montoya was stationary for 8.2 seconds and re-emerged in fifth, getting stuck behind the duel for third between Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher.

With a clear road ahead, Häkkinen built his lead over Michael Schumacher to 10 seconds by lap 27 after setting two consecutive fastest laps. As Michael Schumacher burned off fuel and became lighter, Häkkinen was told that going as fast as he could was unnecessary. Montoya was held up further back by teammate Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello. Seven laps later, Williams team manager Dickie Stanford repeatedly asked Ralf Schumacher by radio and a switch sign on a pit board to let Montoya past. Ralf Schumacher did not let Montoya pass because he believed he was driving fast enough to overtake Barrichello, but was unable to do so. Montoya did not attempt to overtake Ralf Schumacher with an aggressive manoevure. Ralf Schumacher made his only pit stop on the 36th lap, allowing Montoya to battle Barrichello for third. His pit stop took two to three seconds longer than intended because his mechanics had difficulty extracting the refuelling nozzle from his car. Ralf Schumacher rejoined the circuit in sixth, just ahead of Heidfeld and Frentzen, as Räikkönen moved to fifth. On lap 36, Frentzen battled Heidfeld for sixth and attempted to pass him twice but failed because Ralf Schumacher delayed them. Two laps later, Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s engine cut out, forcing him to retire at the side of the circuit at the exit of Bridge corner.

On lap 39, both Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher made pit stops, with Häkkinen keeping his lead and Schumacher emerging in fourth, dropping teammate Barrichello and Montoya in the duel for second at Becketts Corner. Montoya was unable to pass Barrichello, who was able to draw away due to a light fuel load. Three laps later, Montoya entered the pit lane for his second pit stop, lasting 10.9 seconds. Montoya&#x27;s stop took two to three seconds longer than usual due to undershooting his pit box by , tyre installation troubles and fuel nozzle removal. Barrichello made his one and only pit stop on lap 43. The stop lasted 8.5 seconds and fell to third, ahead of Montoya, as he drove quickly on the lap of his pit stop. On that lap, Alonso, who was battling the Benetton drivers and Bernoldi for position, had his left-front wheel become detached from his Minardi without warning near the pit lane entry. The wheel rolled into a gravel trap before hitting a tyre wall at Woodcote corner, making his pit stop longer than intended. Further back, Bernoldi and Fisichella completed their second pit stops, and both drivers exited the pit lane side-by-side, with Bernoldi slowing to prevent a collision and allowing Fisichella to pass. The stewards opted not to reprimand Bernoldi after consulting with Arrows team members.

Irvine was the final driver to make a pit stops for fuel and tyres on lap 47. He returned to the circuit in ninth. At the end of the same lap, after the scheduled pit stops, Häkkinen led Michael Schumacher by 23.9 seconds, followed by Barrichello, Montoya, Räikkönen, and Heidfeld. Häkkinen continued to lap consistently faster than Michael Schumacher, stretching his lead to 33.6 seconds by the race&#x27;s end on lap 60, despite slowing slightly on the final lap due to reliability concerns stemming from losing the earlier in the season. It was his first victory since the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix and his 19th in Formula One. Michael Schumacher chose not to challenge Häkkinen, finishing second, 25.6 seconds ahead of teammate Barrichello in third. Montoya was the last driver on the lead lap in fourth, having fallen behind Barrichello on his final set of tyres. Räikkonen finished fifth, outperforming teammate Heidfeld, who earned the final championship point by finishing sixth. Frentzen had understeer and was seventh. Villeneuve and Irvine were eighth and ninth respectively. Verstappen was 10th with a failing engine and excess oversteer on his first set of tyres. Alesi finished 11th with a car that lacked grip. De La Rosa was 12th following a malfunctioning refuelling machine at his first pit stop. Fisichella was 13th with Bernoldi 14th. Button, 15th, had a power steering failure on lap 15 and Alonso was the final classified finisher in 16th.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Häkkinen said it felt &quot;really good&quot; to win the race after a challenging season thus far. He also stated that he hoped to win more races before the season ended, and that it was &quot;very important&quot; that he passed Michael Schumacher for the race lead since it would have been &quot;difficult to get the distance and the gap&quot; he needed for both of his pit stops. Michael Schumacher admitted that he had a &quot;difficult day&quot; driving a hard car, but commended Häkkinen for winning the Grand Prix. He also dismissed suggestions from Formula One analysts that he had traction control issues. Barrichello stated he was pleased with his third-place result and that Ferrari feared their tyres would not survive long on the track. He also felt it was the right decision to stay on the track longer than Montoya.

Häkkinen&#x27;s triumph was well received in the paddock, and the crowd congratulated him. McLaren team principal Ron Dennis commented, &quot;For half the race, we were trying to slow Mika&#x27;s pace. You have to be careful because drivers tend to make mistakes when they back off but Mika drove brilliantly all day.&quot; Ferrari sporting director Jean Todt acknowledged that a one-stop strategy was the incorrect one but he was also complimentary of Häkkinen, saying, &quot;McLaren are strong and Mika is a great driver. I am pleased for him that he has a win. We have always known how good they are and never listened to what other people felt. We never under-estimated him.&quot;

Coulthard apologised to his McLaren technicians for ruining his car, and they accepted his apology. He attributed blame to Trulli for their first lap collision, &quot;I was ahead of Jarno and I thought I could hold the front line. Two into one does not go and I was in the lead so I think he should have backed off.&quot; Trulli labelled the collision a &quot;racing incident&quot; and said he provided Coulthard with as much room as he could, &quot;I tried to get out of the way but there was nowhere to go. It was an accident. I will have a word with him later to clear the air.&quot; Dennis contended that Coulthard was ahead of Trulli, however Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed Coulthard should have pulled off and that the contact harmed Coulthard&#x27;s chances of winning the world championship against Michael Schumacher. Villeneuve apologised to his teammate Panis for their collision on the first lap, while Panis described it as &quot;a racing incident and I think we will now try and forget about it.&quot;

According to Williams technical director Patrick Head, Montoya would have finished third if his teammate Ralf Schumacher had let him pass when advised. Montoya claimed to be faster than Ralf Schumacher because both drivers were using different strategies and consulted with Williams about it, &quot;They said: &#x27;Ralf&#x27;s trying to get past Rubens. Turn down your fuel mixture and take it easy.&quot; Ralf Schumacher said his team &quot;had the right strategy and we could have been on the podium. This is a weekend to forget in terms of results, but we should also learn from this to try and improve our chances next year. Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn said his team had &quot;a fairly conservative strategy today, which was what we needed&quot; since they were defending not attacking, adding, &quot;Our strategy gave us less possibility to attack, but we did not feel that here at Silverstone we could afford to take more risks.&quot;

The race result increased Michael Schumacher&#x27;s World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead to 37 points over second-placed Coulthard. Barrichello moved into third position with 34 points, demoting Ralf Schumacher to fourth with 31 points. Häkkinen&#x27;s win lifted him from sixth to fifth in the championship standings with 19 points, however, he was mathematically eliminated from title contention because he trailed Michael Schumacher by 65 points and the remaining six Grands Prix could only award 60 points. Ferrari&#x27;s lead over McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship remained at 52 points. Williams retained third with 46 points, Sauber fourth with 19, and Jordan fifth with 15.

<text>The 2001 German Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland 2001) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 July 2001 at the Hockenheimring in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It was the 12th round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 63rd German Grand Prix. Williams driver Ralf Schumacher won the 45-lap race starting from second. Rubens Barrichello finished second for Ferrari with BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve third scoring his last F1 podium finish.

Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship from David Coulthard of McLaren with Ferrari atop the World Constructors&#x27; Championship over McLaren. Juan Pablo Montoya began from pole position alongside Ralf Schumacher after recording the quickest qualifying lap. Michael Schumacher started fourth, behind Mika Häkkinen of McLaren. The race was marked by an airborne accident going into the first corner involving Michael Schumacher and Luciano Burti for Prost, which caused the track to be scattered with shreds of carbon fibre and the race restarted as a result. Both Williams drivers retained their positions at the end of the first lap, with Michael Schumacher passing Häkkinen for third. Over the course of the race, Montoya extended a considerable lead over Ralf Schumacher. Montoya lost the lead on lap 24 when an issue with a refuelling rig caused him to be stationary for more than 20 seconds. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead and held it to achieve his third victory of the season.

As a consequence of the final race order, Michael Schumacher retained his points advantage in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship over second-placed Coulthard as both drivers retired from the Grand Prix. Ralf Schumacher moved ahead of Barrichello to take over third position. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari with 124 points retained their lead, while Williams reduced the deficit to McLaren by ten points, with five races of the season remaining. This was the last Grand Prix to be held on the layout; the race would be held on a shorter reconfigured track starting in .

==Background==
The 2001 German Grand Prix was the 12th of 17 rounds in the 2001 Formula One World Championship and took place on the Hockenheimring in Hockenheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany on 29 July 2001. Before the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 84 points, ahead of McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard on 47 points and Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello with 34 points. Ralf Schumacher of Williams was fourth on 31 points, and McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen was fifth on 19 points. Ferrari led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 118 points, 52 ahead of second place team McLaren. Williams were third on 46 points, while Sauber with 19 points were fourth and Jordan were fifth on 15 points.

After the on 15 July, eight teams conducted mid-season testing at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17 and 20 July to prepare for the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodynamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.

A total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) each entered two drivers for the event. There was one driver change heading into the race. Having driven for Jordan since the season-opening , Heinz-Harald Frentzen was sacked by Jordan and was replaced by its third driver Zonta. Frentzen announced he would take legal action against Jordan and team principal Eddie Jordan said that Frentzen&#x27;s management was unhappy with Jordan&#x27;s current performance but denied rumours that a heated row occurred. The Schumacher brothers were sympathetic towards Frentzen who felt unhappy about the manner in which he was sacked. Irvine came to Jordan&#x27;s defence and said that he believed the decision was influenced by problems Jordan had with World Champion Damon Hill who had similar poor performances like Frentzen. In an interview with &quot;The Sunday Independent&quot; in 2005, Jordan later claimed that Frentzen was sacked because engine supplier Honda wanted Japanese driver Takuma Sato to race for Jordan in and to retain Honda&#x27;s engine supply.

Some teams made modifications to their cars in preparation for the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test the gearbox during the first free practice session.

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race—two one-hour sessions on Friday, and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather. Barrichello lapped fastest in the first session, at 1 minute and 41.953 seconds, late on, going three-tenths of a second quicker than early pace setter, Jaguar&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa. Coulthard was third fastest despite going off the circuit at the Clark chicane. Michael Schumacher, fourth, went off at the Senna chicane. Ralf Schumacher, Häkkinen, Williams&#x27; Juan Pablo Montoya, Eddie Irvine (Jaguar), Giancarlo Fisichella (Benetton) and Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli followed in positions five through ten. Other drivers went off the circuit during the session.

In the second practice session, Irvine reset the circuit lap record at 1:41.424 25 minutes in. He was ahead of Montoya in second who had extra wing and a stiffer rear-end to deal with an understeer he had been affected by. Häkkinen ran with a heavy fuel load and was the highest-placed Bridgestone-shod entrant in third, with Barrichello fourth. Michael Schumacher took fifth place, running wide at the circuit&#x27;s chicanes which prevented him from setting a quicker lap. De La Rosa, whose car developed an engine hydraulics issue, Coulthard, Prost&#x27;s Jean Alesi, Trulli. and Ralf Schumacher, who collided with the Sudkurve tyre barrier after going wide in the stadium section and hitting a kerb during his first time lap after five minutes, followed in the top ten. Tarso Marques lost control of his Minardi car at the Ostkurve corner and his teammate Fernando Alonso drove into the gravel in avoidance. Both cars sustained no major damage.

The weather remained hot and dry for the Saturday practice sessions. Michael Schumacher was quickest in the third session, with a time of 1:39.937. Barrichello was second quickest, almost half a second slower than Michael Schumacher. The two Williams drivers were third and fourth; Ralf Schumacher ahead of Montoya. Coulthard secured the fifth fastest time, two-tenths of a second faster than teammate Häkkinen in sixth. Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld, Jacques Villeneuve of British American Racing (BAR), Irvine and Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen rounded out the top ten. Benetton driver Jenson Button did not set a time. Häkkinen understeered wide into the gravel and grass at Agip turn during his first quick lap and he was delayed in the pit lane while gravel was removed from his car.

In the final practice session, Ralf Schumacher lapped fastest at 1:39.188 that he recorded 22 minutes into the session, almost three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Montoya in second. Montoya attempted to better his teammate&#x27;s lap but slowed and set his best lap on his next attempt. Michael Schumacher was unable to better his lap time from the preceding session and he fell to third. Häkkinen was fourth-fastest; Heidfeld fifth; Barrichello sixth; Irvine seventh and Panis eighth. Coulthard, who beached his McLaren in the Agip corner gravel trap and spent most of the session in the pit lane after pushing his car back to that area, was ninth and Trulli tenth.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one hour qualifying session saw each driver limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held in dry and hot weather conditions; conditions were expected to be warmer for qualifying. Montoya clinched his first pole position of his Formula One career, with a track lap record of 1:38.117. Although he was pleased with his starting position, he was surprised at his team&#x27;s performance in qualifying; Montoya lost two-tenths of a second in the second sector and found time in the stadium section. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by teammate Ralf Schumacher whose lap was 0.019 seconds slower than Montoya who displaced Schumacher from pole just after halfway through qualifying. It marked the first time since the 1997 British Grand Prix that both Williams cars began a Formula One race from the first two starting positions. Häkkinen used three sets of tyres in qualifying third and praised the handling of his car for his good performance. Michael Schumacher secured fourth and was disappointed not to be ahead of the two McLaren cars. Coulthard, fifth, had tyre blistering caused by a loose rear and conserved his tyre use by abandoning his final run. Barrichello managed sixth having been unable to improve his time because of a spin. Behind the leading six, the two Sauber cars were seventh and eighth, Heidfeld qualifying in front of Räikkönen, with both drivers having their cars modified helping them to run faster (Heidfeld adjusted his set-up while Räikkönen raised his ride height for his third run).

De La Rosa and Irvine qualified in ninth and eleventh positions respectively for Jaguar; the pair were separated by Trulli whose engine failed on his third run and could not return to the pit lane to use his team&#x27;s spare car. The three drivers were ahead of Villeneuve in the faster BAR car, who in turn, was ahead of teammate Panis; both drivers struggled to find grip throughout qualifying. Alesi qualified 14th, more than four-tenths of a second in front of Prost teammate Luciano Burti due to a setup change by Burti for his first run; the latter spun off in the circuit&#x27;s stadium section and hit the barrier backwards which caused a yellow flag to be shown and prevented any lap time improvement. The two were split by Zonta&#x27;s slower Jordan car who mounted a kerb at the Senna chicane on his third run, which lost him time and he encountered Panis in the stadium section. Fisichella took 17th and his teammate Button was 18th. Button&#x27;s car had its gearbox changed in the morning and he pulled to the side of the track with a failed engine on his final timed lap. Fisichella encountered a slower car on his final lap. Behind them, the Arrows drivers managed to qualify in 18th and 19th because their cars lacked power; Enrique Bernoldi qualifying ahead of Jos Verstappen. Bernoldi improved his car&#x27;s handling although his potential best run was disrupted because of Button&#x27;s engine failure and Verstappen spun on his final timed lap. The starting order was completed by Alonso and Marques in the Minardi cars due to them being underpowered; Marques first run was affected by a gear selection fault and came across a spun car during his final run.

===Qualifying classification===

==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session in clear weather. Ralf Schumacher set the fastest time of the session at 1:42.621 on his final lap after leading for much of warm-up. His teammate Montoya finished with the second fastest time at the session&#x27;s end. Coulthard was third quickest, and Michael Schumacher completed the top four, one-tenth of a second behind Ralf Schumacher. Alonso spun at the Sudkurve corner and skated across the gravel trap towards the tyre barriers. Trulli&#x27;s engine failed exiting the Ostkurve corner during his third lap and he parked his car onto the grass before returning to the pit lane ten minutes later to drive the spare car. Not long after Zonta made contact with the tyre barrier at Sudkurve turn in the stadium section after spinning into the gravel. Alonso struck the tyre barrier sideways close to Zonta. His Minardi teammate Marques spun into the gravel at Ostkurve corner but avoided damaging his car; he narrowly avoided Burti.

==Race==
The weather conditions on the grid were dry before the race; the air temperature was and the track temperature . The race commenced at 14:00 local time. It lasted 45 laps over a distance of . Approximately 100,000 spectators attended the Grand Prix. As all 22 drivers were preparing to begin the formation lap, Alonso and Marques began from the pit lane due to fuel leaking from the refuelling values. Alonso drove the spare Minardi car with Marques using his teammate&#x27;s repaired vehicle. Michael Schumacher began to be affected by a gearbox selection problem while on the parade lap which the Ferrari team had hoped was slow-speed related.

Both Williams drivers maintained first and second entering the first turn. Further back, Michael Schumacher slowed due to his gearbox selection fault that prevented him from shifting out of first gear and he drove in a straight line in the middle of the circuit. This resulted in drivers being required to swerve to avoid Schumacher. As Panis was blocking his view and Zonta driving to the left, Burti was unable to view the Ferrari and struck it. Burti struck Schumacher&#x27;s right-rear wheel and went five feet into the air. He barrel rolled to the right, over the top of Bernoldi&#x27;s vehicle, struck the ground and landed upright after rolling. Burti landed upright between both Arrows cars; his left-front wheel (which detached in the collision) broke Bernoldi&#x27;s engine cover and rear wing. Burti&#x27;s car bounced across the gravel trap and rested on the Nordkurve corner left-hand tyre barriers. Schumacher&#x27;s car was on the middle of the circuit. FIA race director Charlie Whiting deployed the safety car before he red-flagged the race for safety reasons as the field entered the first turn to start the second lap. A plethora of carbon fibre strands were scattered across the track that drivers had to drive around and marshals were needed to remove the debris.

Burti and Michael Schumacher were not injured but their cars had been damaged beyond repair, and raced their team&#x27;s spare vehicles. The Minardi cars underwent further repairs and both drivers started on the grid for the restart at 14:24 local time. Michelin instructed teams that ran their tyres to change them due to the risk of a puncture. Barrichello&#x27;s rear wing was replaced after Häkkinen made contact with him, for which the latter apologised. At the restart, Montoya and Ralf Schumacher again held their positions, while Häkkinen led the Ferrari cars and his teammate Coulthard entering the first corner. Further down the field, De La Rosa lost control of his Jaguar as he braked late into the Clark chicane entry and hit Heidfeld&#x27;s car. Both De La Rosa and Heidfeld retired from the Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher took third from Häkkinen into the same area. Going into the stadium section, Barrichello passed Coulthard on the outside for fifth after a short battle for the position. Verstappen moved from 20th to 11th by the first lap&#x27;s conclusion, while Button made up five positions over the same distance. As the drivers completed lap one, Montoya led Ralf Schumacher by 1.4 seconds, who was followed in turn by, Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Coulthard, Räikkönen and Irvine. 

Montoya began to gradually pull away from Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Fisichella for 15th on lap two. Barrichello overtook Häkkinen on the outside on the straight leading to the Ostkurve chicane for third a lap later. Further down the field, Button lost 13th to a pass by Panis during the same lap. On lap five, Panis overtook Zonta for 12th, while Bernoldi passed Button for 14th. At the Senna chicane on lap six, Barrichello moved to third position after Michael Schumacher was instructed to let Barrichello past so that his teammate could overtake the McLaren and still switch places if required. On the same lap, Zonta went into the rear of Verstappen&#x27;s car, causing Zonta to lose his front wing. Verstappen fell behind Panis after the collision. Zonta made a pit stop for repairs, but retired after driving one exploratory lap due to major damage. Verstappen made his pit stop and rejoined at the back of the field. Alesi passed Burti for 15th on lap nine, and Panis overtook teammate Villeneuve for tenth the following lap. On the tenth lap, Panis unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Trulli for ninth on the inside. Panis unsuccessfully again tried to pass Trulli on the outside during the following lap due to a lack of straight line speed. During the twelfth lap, Panis passed Trulli on the outside at the Clark chicane by braking later than Trulli in his third attempt. Trulli slipstreamed Panis before spinning at the Ostkurve corner trying to reclaim ninth. He fell to 17th.

Häkkinen retired from the Grand Prix with fluid leaking from his left-hand sidepod onto the circuit on lap 15. His retirement promoted Räikkonen to sixth. By lap 15, Montoya led Ralf Schumacher by 8.3 seconds, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front ahead of Barrichello, as Ralf Schumacher wad dealing with a brake problem. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis was the first of the leaders to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 17 and returned to the circuit in fifth, behind Coulthard. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello and one for Michael Schumacher whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop for both their drivers. Räikkonen slowed on track with a driveshaft failure but returned to the pit lane to retire that same lap, while Irvine retired with fuel pressure problems. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth after spinning and Trulli and Panis passed him. Barrichello unsuccessfully attempted to pass Coulthard for fourth on lap 19. 
Montoya continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher—setting the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:41.808 on lap 20—to maintain the lead after his sole pit stop. Barrichello overtook Coulthard for fourth on the outside at the fast right-hand Agip corner that lap. Montoya made his pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller to switch to the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher due a regulator failure. This meant Montoya remained stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual and one-and-a-half times more fuel went into his car. Ralf Schumacher took the lead with Michael Schumacher second; Montoya fell to fourth. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and retired at the side of the main straight with a fuel pump pressure problem. Burti lost control of his car and was beached in the gravel trap against the tyre barrier at Nordkurve on the following lap.

On lap 24, Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all made their pit stops on that lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car&#x27;s afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. His retirement moved Coulthard to third. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 27 and fell to fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 28 and immediately became the race&#x27;s next retirement when he accelerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event saw him stop at the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on the 32nd lap and emerged behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop a lap later and was delayed for 12 seconds because the Ferrari fuel hose closed itself. This meant Barrichello&#x27;s team switched to a functioning refuelling rig.

At the completion of lap 33, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the race order was, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Fisichella, Button and Alesi. Trulli became the final retirement after stopping at the side of the circuit due to a hydraulic pump failure on lap 35. Ralf Schumacher began to reduce his pace by lap 37 but managed to lap quicker than Barrichello. He received a pit board message three laps later which advised him to refill his car&#x27;s fluids. Fisichella went off the circuit on lap 43 while catching Villeneuve, and both Arrows drivers avoided a collision for eighth. With his closest challenger more than 46 seconds behind, Ralf Schumacher crossed the finish line on lap 45 to secure his third victory of the season and of his career in a time of 1 hour 18 minutes and 17.873 seconds, at an average speed of . Barrichello finished in second 46.1 seconds behind, ahead of Villeneuve in third for his second podium at Hockenheim. Fisichella was fourth due to the high retirement rate, Michelin&#x27;s hard tyre compound and better engine reliability. His teammate Button was close behind in fifth, and Alesi was 0.496 seconds behind in the final points-paying position of sixth; his car&#x27;s wing pods prevented him from attacking on the long straights. Panis, seventh, was the final driver on the lead lap, with Bernoldi, Verstappen and Alonso the final classified finishers. Due to the warm weather and the circuit&#x27;s long length stressing the machinery a lot, the attrition rate was high, with ten of the twenty-two starters finishing the race.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Ralf Schumacher said that it was &quot;a great feeling&quot; when he asked to describe how he felt by winning his &quot;home&quot; Grand Prix. He also revealed that he had brakes issues during the start of the race and that he was ensuring that his engine would last the full race distance. Barrichello said that he was &quot;happy&quot; with finishing in second and revealed that before the race he believed that he would finish no higher than third. Villeneuve stated that he was &quot;surprised&quot; that he achieved a podium position. Furthermore, he believed that more work was undertaken to improve his car than his previous third place in the .

Both Benetton drivers managed to finish both their cars in the points for the first time in the season. Fisichella said he was &quot;very happy, for Jenson and myself&quot; and thanked members of his team for his result. Button believed that his team&#x27;s good result was because of improved changes to the balance on his Benetton. He later revealed that he accidentally removed his water bottle tube from his mouth which caused water to spray on his face under braking. The result led to Benetton technical director Mike Gascoyne to describe the race as &quot;a useful kick-start before the final races of the season&quot; and said Benetton would ensure that the result was not &quot;a one-off&quot;. Alesi described the weekend as &quot;a very important one for the team&quot; because of his sixth-place finish. Heidfeld said he felt confident he would have finished in the first three positions had De La Rosa not collided with him. De La Rosa admitted to making an error by braking earlier than usual and said that he would apologise to Heidfeld after underestimating how close the latter was.

Montoya left the circuit without speaking to journalists. He admitted to being &quot;so disappointed I cannot find the words to describe how I feel. Up to the pit stop the race was going perfectly for me.&quot; Michael Schumacher shared similar feelings to Montoya: &quot;I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race to go. It was a shame not to finish the race and pick up a further six points.&quot; He denied reports that television footage showed him apparently laughing when Coulthard retired, saying he was joking with the marshals. BMW Motorsport&#x27;s technical director Mario Theissen surmised that the two starts and Montoya&#x27;s delayed pit stop causing the engine temperatures to rise likely caused Montoya&#x27;s engine failure. Williams technical director Patrick Head was unhappy with the refueling rigs supplied by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA). One of the rigs was sent back to manufacturer Intertechnique who found no system faults. 

After the crash between himself and Burti on the first lap, Michael Schumacher said that although he saw Burti in his rear-view mirrors, he did not know which line he wanted to take and he could not take avoiding action because of his gear selection problem. Burti said that the accident &quot;looked worse on TV&quot; and that he stated his spin on lap 18 was caused because his left arm was aching from the crash. FIA medical delegate Sid Watkins attributed the safety measures made in Formula One since the 1970s for preventing Burti and Michael Schumacher from sustaining a major injury. Coulthard questioned the decision to stop the race by saying: &quot;Accidents or injury off the track is not normally a reason to stop the race. There&#x27;s lots of races that would have benefited from being red-flagged to give people a show.&quot; He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard&#x27;s view. A spokesman for the FIA confirmed and defended the red-flag decision and they said it was shown to prevent a larger accident. Michelin Motorsport Director Pierre Dupasquier agreed with the FIA&#x27;s view and stated he was concerned about cars hitting the strands of debris and catching a puncture.

The race result saw Michael Schumacher retain his World Drivers&#x27; Championship lead over Coulthard. Race winner Ralf Schumacher, on 41 points, moved to third and Barrichello&#x27;s second-place demoted him to fourth. McLaren&#x27;s non-score saw Ferrari extend their World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead to fifty-eight points. Williams retained third on 56 points, but were ten points closer to McLaren, with five races of the season remaining. This was the final Formula One event to be held at the high-speed configuration of the Hockenheimring circuit; the circuit was shortened by 1.5 miles and the new layout was used starting from the 2002 season.

<text>The 2001 Hungarian Grand Prix (officially the XVII Marlboro Magyar Nagydij) was a Formula One motor race held before 110,000 spectators at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary on 19 August 2001. It was the 13th race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 16th Hungarian Grand Prix forming part of the series. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the 77-lap race from pole position. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second and David Coulthard was third for McLaren.

Entering the Grand Prix, only Michael Schumacher and Coulthard remained in contention for the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Schumacher leading Coulthard by 37 points. Ferrari were also in contention to claim the World Constructors&#x27; Championship in Hungary. Michael Schumacher qualified on pole position by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, and he began alongside Coulthard. Barrichello made a brisk start to pass Coulthard and he tactically delayed the McLaren driver from lap 12 to provide his teammate Michael Schumacher with a significant lead over the rest of the field. Schumacher only lost the lead during the pit stop phases, maintaining the lead for the majority of the race to achieve his seventh victory of 2001 and the 51st of his career. His win confirmed him as the 2001 Drivers&#x27; Champion, as Coulthard could not pass his points total with four races remaining in the season, and he equalled Alain Prost for the all-time record of career victories.

Schumacher received praise from many in the Formula One community for his title victory and it was headline news in Germany and Italy. Barrichello&#x27;s second-place finish helped Ferrari win the World Constructors&#x27; Championship for the third consecutive season and the 11th time overall. McLaren were 13 points ahead of Williams in third while Sauber moved one point ahead of British American Racing (BAR) for fourth.

==Background==

The 2001 Hungarian Grand Prix was the 13th of the 17 motor races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 16th running of the event as part of the series. It took place at the 16-turn Hungaroring in Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary on 19 August. The Hungaroring has been likened to the Circuit de Monaco because it is narrow, making overtaking difficult. The circuit was bumpy and dusty and it did not provide a major advantage to cars installed with powerful engines.

Before the race Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 84 points, ahead of David Coulthard of McLaren with 47 points and Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher with 41. Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fourth on 40 points, and McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen was fifth with 19 points. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship Ferrari led with 124 points, 58 points ahead of McLaren. Williams were third with 56 points; Sauber with 19 points and British American Racing (BAR) with 16 points contended for fourth place. A maximum of 40 points were available for the final four races, which meant Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher could still win the title. Michael Schumacher needed to win the Grand Prix, regardless of where Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher finished. Had both Ferrari cars finished first and second, the team would secure the World Constructors&#x27; Championship for the third consecutive year.

By winning the race, Michael Schumacher would take his 51st career victory, putting him equal with four-time World Champion Alain Prost and join Prost and Juan Manuel Fangio as the third driver to win four or more titles. He said the championship was not in his mindset in Hungary and was looking forward to the race, &quot;I am excited about the possibility of becoming champion a fourth time but if I don&#x27;t look it, it&#x27;s because I am not there yet. How can I be excited if I am not there yet? Only having the possibility doesn&#x27;t count. I will get excited when it is in my pocket.&quot; In contrast, Coulthard was within four points of Michael Schumacher entering the Monaco Grand Prix; he finished fifth after failing to move off the starting grid due to a computer glitch. Thereafter, mechanical attrition and one accident gave Coulthard six points in the next five races and fell 37 points behind Schumacher.

A total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructors) fielded two drivers each for the Grand Prix. There were two driver changes for the race. Having been in one of the Prost cars since the first race of the year in Australia, Jean Alesi completed negotiations for the release of his contract with the French constructor and joined the Jordan team for the rest of the season. Alesi&#x27;s Prost AP04 was driven by Heinz-Harald Frentzen—whom Jordan sacked before the preceding German Grand Prix—until the conclusion of the season. Both drivers were allowed to familiarise themselves with their new cars in the week before the race. Frentzen and Alesi completed separate shakedown tests (the maximum amount of mileage allowed under the sporting regulations during the three-week summer moratorium from in-season testing) at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours and the Silverstone Circuit, respectively.

Several teams made modifications to their cars to maximise slow speed grip and traction and setup for the Hungaroring&#x27;s high-speed chicanes. Minardi introduced a revised chassis for both of its race and test PS01s, which comprised a new titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry, tested by Andrea Piccini at the Fiorano Circuit. McLaren mounted a secondary wing to the tail of the MP4/16&#x27;s engine cover above its gearbox and Williams did the same as it installed cooling bodywork on the engine for the first time since the Malaysian Grand Prix. The Benetton and Sauber teams fitted new front wings and undertrays to their vehicles while the former constructor also introduced revised bargeboards and a rear diffuser. Both Ferrari and Jaguar brought a revised high-downforce configuration that was an evolution of the package they utilised at the Monaco Grand Prix. BAR installed a new diffuser featuring two vertical strakes in each side channel, as well as a new floor and front wing. The 003 also featured additional winglets on the engine cover that were used at the Monaco Grand Prix. Jordan brought significant updates, including a new engine cover with a deeper top section and shallower lower section and a revised shape around the rear suspension. The new bodywork was complemented by a new undertray and diffuser. Jordan added a horizontal narrowing chord winglet similar to that of the Williams FW23 ahead of the sidepod inlets. Jordan also modified the pedal arrangement for Alesi&#x27;s car, as he disliked the left-foot braking technique used by Frentzen and Zonta. Arrows brought a new front wing for the A22 and installed small wings over the rain light and rear axle used at the Monaco Grand Prix. Prost used its double-element front wing from Monaco and added a small wing over the rear axle. Frentzen used Brembo brakes instead of the Carbon Industrie components Alesi preferred.

==Practice==
A total of four practice sessions preceded Sunday&#x27;s race, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. Friday&#x27;s two practice sessions were held in hot and clear weather. In the morning session, Michael Schumacher lapped quickest at 1 minute, 16.995 seconds, 0.288 seconds faster than his teammate Barrichello in second. The McLaren cars of Häkkinen and Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, Nick Heidfeld of Sauber, Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, the BAR vehicles of Olivier Panis and Jacques Villeneuve and Kimi Räikkönen for Sauber rounded out the session&#x27;s top ten drivers. Alesi was restricted to four timed laps because he skidded into a gravel trap at turn 13. Ralf Schumacher avoided curtailing his session after a spin into the turn one gravel trap and reversing out of it. Coulthard understeered into the turn 12 chicane gravel trap and pushed the McLaren&#x27;s undertray through the bottom of its monocoque on a serrated kerb with five minutes left, causing a four-minute stoppage to clear carbon fibre debris.

Michael Schumacher repeated his morning form in the afternoon session with the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1 minute, 16.651 seconds. Barrichello in second closed to within 0.083 seconds of his teammate and Häkkinen third. Ralf Schumacher was fourth-fastest, ahead of Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, Alesi, Giancarlo Fisichella of Benetton, Heidfeld, Panis and Coulthard in fifth to tenth. Several drivers, including Frentzen, Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher, spun or went off the circuit during the session without damaging their cars. After Friday&#x27;s sessions, Ferrari and Coulthard lodged a complaint with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile race director Charlie Whiting over the height of the kerbs at turn 12. Race officials agreed to lower its height by on Saturday morning to allow cars to be propelled more smoothly over turn 12.

It continued to be hot and humid for the two Saturday morning practice sessions. Michael Schumacher led the third practice session at 1 minute, 15.466 seconds. His teammate Barrichello remained in second. The two McLaren cars of Häkkinen and Coulthard were third and fourth. Heidfeld, Ralf Schumacher, Panis, Trulli, Juan Pablo Montoya of the Williams team and Räikkönen were in positions six through ten. While the session passed relatively peacefully, Räikkönen stopped on track midway through practice with his car&#x27;s overheating exhaust system catching fire, which was extinguished by track marshals.

Coulthard was quickest in the final practice session to prevent Ferrari from leading every session with a 1-minute, 15.266 seconds lap. Michael Schumacher could not go faster after going wide onto the grass exiting turn six and later spun off the track at turn 12. He remained in second in front of his teammate Barrichello in third and the faster Heidfeld in fourth. Häkkinen, Trulli, Ralf Schumacher, Montoya, Irvine and Fisichella were fifth through tenth. Seven minutes into the session, Ralf Schumacher beached his car in a gravel trap at turn nine and Minardi&#x27;s Tarso Marques spun at turn nine.

==Qualifying==
Saturday afternoon&#x27;s one hour qualifying session saw each driver limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by their fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107 per cent of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race. It remained hot and clear with the air temperature from and a track temperature between . Several drivers waited for 20 minutes before commencing their first timed laps. Michael Schumacher overtook Hakkinen as the fastest driver on his first attempt, having opted to do two timed laps. He set his quickest lap with 20 minutes remaining, taking his ninth pole position of the season and the 41st of his career with a new qualifying track record of 1 minute, 14.059 seconds. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Coulthard who was 0.801 seconds slower; an oversteer put him wide at the left-hand turn 13 and Frentzen had earlier slowed him. Barrichello in third was delayed by Montoya early on after which his Ferrari&#x27;s balance changed and developed more understeer due to rising track temperatures. Ralf Schumacher was the highest-placed Michelin shod car in fourth, and fifth-placed Trulli aborted one timed lap following an error. Häkkinen had difficulty finding an ideal setup for his McLaren and took sixth. Heidfeld, seventh, aborted two of his timed laps through separate minor errors. Eighth-placed Montoya had a power understeer that caused him to spin. An understeer in Räikkönen&#x27;s Sauber on his last two laps put him ninth. Villeneuve adjusted his car&#x27;s setup to qualify tenth.

Panis in 11th was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten because he lost time with an electrical fault and spun because of an inoperable traction control system. Alesi made it an all-French sixth row in 12th; he admitted he required additional familiarity with his car. The Jaguars occupied 13th and 14th places: Pedro de la Rosa ahead of his teammate Irvine; the former made errors on his first two timed laps and the latter said he over-drove trying to qualify in the top ten. Fisichella in the faster of the two Benetton cars in 15th reported a loss of grip. Frentzen in a lightly fuelled car could not match his form from the morning&#x27;s practice sessions and took 16th. Two engine failures in practice required Jenson Button to drive the spare Benetton, which had poor grip and balance and left him 17th. Button felt the spare car which featured different steering arms that made it feel heavier to him did not suit his driving style. Fernando Alonso qualified his Minardi in 18th. Luciano Burti of the Prost team had balance problems that caused his car to yearn from understeer and oversteer and was 19th. The two Arrows of Enrique Bernoldi and Jos Verstappen were 20th and 21st; Verstappen drove Arrows&#x27; spare vehicle after damaging his race car in a crash during practice and Bernoldi&#x27;s engine cut out on his final timed lap. Tarso Marques for Minardi was the final qualifier in 22nd as he had a setup that could not be changed for increased car performance due to him replacing a sensor.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

A half an hour warm-up session took place on Sunday morning in dry and hot weather. All drivers fine-tuned their race set-ups against the weather of the time, and set laps in their spare cars. While he was briefly delayed by a battery fault that affected his car&#x27;s gear change mechanism, Coulthard led with a lap of 1 minute and 16.915 seconds with the Ferrari duo of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello second and third. Ralf Schumacher, Häkkinen, Trulli, Heidfeld, Panis, Räikkönen and Irvine occupied positions four to ten. Bernoldi was the only driver to lose control of his car during the session, running wide at the first corner and continued.

==Race==
The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time and before 110,000 spectators. It lasted 77 laps over a distance of . The weather was hot and humid with some cloud cover, with the air temperature between and the track temperature from ; conditions were expected to remain consistent with a light south-easterly wind and a 20 per cent chance of rain was forecast. Tyre consistency from over the season was predicted to allow for a one-stop strategy and had the possibility of a slower car impeding the leaders for several laps. A two stop-strategy was theorised to give drivers a better chance of maintaining on-track position. While on a reconnaissance lap, Michael Schumacher locked his rear brakes and ran into the turn 12 gravel trap en route to the grid. The Ferrari mechanics removed most of the stones from his car and replaced the left-hand side turning vane as a precaution to ensure there was no loose bodywork and changed his tyres. In the meantime, Coulthard&#x27;s race car had a gearbox problem and he switched to the spare McLaren for the start.

Michael Schumacher made a brisk start to maintain his pole position advantage. Coulthard in second made a slow getaway on the dirty side of the track, providing less grip, and Barrichello overtook him on his left into turn one. Barrichello then veered across to protect his teammate from a challenge by Coulthard. In the middle of the pack, Irvine attempted to pass Fisichella on the left; he lost control of the rear of his car on some dirt and got beached in the gravel trap. Trulli slowed to avoid a collision with Heidfeld. Further round the lap, Marques ran off the circuit after he and Frentzen made contact in turn two; both drivers continued. Verstappen made the best getaway in the field, moving from 21st to 16th by the conclusion of the first lap, as Frentzen fell four positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led his teammate Barrichello by 1.3 seconds with Coulthard a further half a second behind in third. Ralf Schumacher was fourth, Trulli fifth and Häkkinen sixth. As the top three began to pull away from the rest of the field, extending their deficit over Ralf Schumacher to 6.8 seconds on lap five, the stewards informed the Benetton team that Button had jumped the start for which he was imposed a ten-second stop-and-go penalty. He took the penalty on the following lap.

Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher was conserving his tyre usage because he felt going faster would become more important as the race progressed. Trulli in fifth slowed Häkkinen, Heidfeld, Montoya and Heidfeld from the eighth lap as Hakkinen attempted an unsuccessful overtake on Trulli. On lap nine, Burti became the Grand Prix&#x27;s second retirement after he spun into a gravel trap at turn 14 on heavily blistered tyres reducing grip. Alesi overtook de la Rosa at turn two for 12th on lap 10. At the front of the field, Barrichello began to tactically slow Coulthard by a second per lap on lap 12, allowing his teammate Michael Schumacher to lead comfortably while lapping slower traffic later on. That lap, Bernoldi locked his rear brakes in him catching Alonso and retired by spinning into a gravel trap at turn four. On lap 13, Button passed Marques to retake 18th. By his first pit stop of the race at the conclusion of the 28th lap, Michael Schumacher extended his lead to 12.8 seconds and broke Nigel Mansell&#x27;s official lap record from the 1992 edition. His stop lasted 8.4 seconds and relinquished the lead to his teammate Barrichello. Michael Schumacher rejoined the race in third, ahead of his brother Ralf Schumacher.

On the 29th lap, Trulli entered the pit lane for his first pit stop. He emerged in 12th after a refuelling rig was lodged in his car for five extra seconds. Ralf Schumacher entered the pit lane on the following lap and he remained in fourth place. Barrichello stayed on the track until at the end of lap 31 to delay Coulthard in second before entering the pit lane for a 9.1 second pit stop to take on of fuel. The tactic did not work as Coulthard&#x27;s pit stop on the next lap was faster than Barrichello&#x27;s and he overtook him. Coulthard was therefore able to drive in clear air and given an opportunity to close up to Michael Schumacher. Further back, Button overtook Alonso for 17th on lap 33. Two more retirements occurred during this stage of the Grand Prix: on lap 35, Button lost control of the rear of the rear of his Benetton car through the final corner, and stopped in the centre of the circuit on the start/finish line. He remained there due to the car stalling because his traction control system failed to operate, engaged in gear, and facing the opposite direction before marshals extricated him under yellow flag conditions. Alonso spun into a gravel trap at turn one when his rear brakes failed on the 38th lap. As Coulthard lowered the gap to Michael Schumacher to 11 seconds, he could not get closer to the Ferrari driver who made a second pit stop on lap 52.

Barrichello made his second pit stop on the next lap, and he rejoined in third, behind his teammate Michael Schumacher. Coulthard led laps 53 and 54 and it appeared he would retain second since the deficit between him and Barrichello was 22.6 seconds. During his second pit stop, the car&#x27;s refuelling rig was jammed for two seconds. Coulthard emerged in third, behind Barrichello. On that lap, Trulli pulled off to the side of the track to retire with an hydraulic failure. On the 58th lap, Panis drove into the garage to allow his team to rectify an electrical fault with his car. Behind the top three, the fifth-placed Häkkinen, who set the overall fastest lap of 1 minute and 16.723 seconds on lap 51, was two seconds a lap faster than Ralf Schumacher in fourth. He lined up a pass on the inside in the corners; he could not pass because of the Williams&#x27; higher straightline speed. Frentzen joined the list of retirees by spinning into a gravel trap on lap 64. Marques was instructed by his team via radio to stop at the side of the track at turn 12 and switch his car&#x27;s engine off because of low fuel pressure soon after. On the 70th lap, Fisichella&#x27;s engine failed, causing him to spin into a gravel trap beside the circuit, and forcing him to retire.

Häkkinen made the race&#x27;s final pit stop for fuel on lap 71. He remained in fifth and fell back from Ralf Schumacher. Two laps later, Panis parked his car in the garage to retire after one exploratory lap. At the front, Michael Schumacher slowed and Barrichello held off Coulthard to enable his teammate to take his seventh victory of the season, and the 51st of his career in a time of 1 hour, 41 minutes, 49.675 seconds at an average speed of , equalling Prost&#x27;s all-time wins record. He became the 2001 Drivers&#x27; Champion and secured his fourth title as Coulthard could not catch his points total with four races left in the season. Michael Schumacher also became the first driver to win consecutive World Drivers&#x27; Championships with Ferrari since Alberto Ascari in the 1953 season. Barrichello finished 3.363 seconds behind in second to win Ferrari&#x27;s third World Constructors&#x27; Championship in a row and 11th overall. Coulthard took third, with Ralf Schumacher fourth, Häkkinen fifth and Heidfeld sixth. The final classified finishers were Räikkönen, Montoya, Villeneuve, Alesi, de la Rosa and Verstappen. The attrition rate was high with 12 of the 22 starters not finishing the race.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Michael Schumacher called his fourth World Drivers&#x27; Championship and his record-equalling 51st career victory &quot;a great achievement&quot; and said comparisons of his three other titles and equalling Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s five titles were unimportant, &quot;I think we want to enjoy this and each one is different and each victory feels different. It&#x27;s always something special, to win a Grand Prix, to win a championship even more, so that&#x27;s what counts.&quot; Barrichello spoke of his pride at helping Ferrari securing the World Constructors&#x27; Championship and admitted to having mixed feelings over falling behind Coulthard after the first round of pit stops, &quot;The first time I was so disappointed and the second time I was so happy, I couldn&#x27;t believe it myself. I think it was probably the same with DC but just the opposite. Fortunately for me, it worked out. I had a wonderful start.&quot; Coulthard was unemotional over losing the title because he sought to win, saying, &quot;It makes no difference to me really whether I&#x27;m second, third or fourth, whatever it happens to be. What&#x27;s important is how I perform in each of the individual races and providing I know that I&#x27;ve given 100 per cent effort from myself, which I know isn&#x27;t always the case, but that&#x27;s obviously the goal, to try and achieve that, then I can&#x27;t do more than that.&quot;

Michael Schumacher received praise for his fourth World Drivers&#x27; Championship and it was headline news in Germany and Italy. He was officially congratulated by Gerhard Schröder, the chancellor of Germany, who wrote a letter to Schumacher saying that his driving ability brought excitement to the sport and wished him well for the 2002 season. Gianni Agnelli, the head of the FIAT Group, said he was overjoyed with the result, and the president of Ferrari Luca Cordero di Montezemolo praised the team for their work over the season. Button predicted Ferrari would continue to be Formula One&#x27;s dominant team and Schumacher its best driver in the long-term. Mansell echoed Button&#x27;s belief, adding, &quot;If Ferrari maintain the impetus they currently have and given the personnel... then I can&#x27;t see anyone stopping them for the next few years, not unless someone comes up with the perfect package.&quot; Around 2,000 people watched the event on a large television screen in Michael Schumacher&#x27;s hometown of Kerpen in the Lower Rhine region with the town decorated in the colours of Ferrari. Church bells in Maranello, the Emilia-Romagna town where Ferrari&#x27;s headquarters are based, rang with several of the marque&#x27;s road cars driving slowly and fans of the team celebrating Schumacher&#x27;s accomplishment.

Ralf Schumacher, who finished fourth, called it &quot;the toughest race of the year&quot; because his vehicle had understeer and oversteer, &quot;I had to work very hard to defend my position against Mika Hakkinen, which I managed to do.&quot; Häkkinen apportioned blame onto Trulli for his fifth-place result and said that him setting a new track record was of little consolation, &quot;During the first 29 laps of the race, I was stuck behind Trulli, who was about 1.5 seconds slower per lap than me. It was only after his first pit stop that I could start to make inroads on Ralf Schumacher, who by then was about 30 seconds ahead.&quot; Irvine said he accepted responsibility for his first lap accident that ended his running, &quot;I made a big charge at the beginning but maybe I carried too much into the corner and paid the price. With so few races left and only four points earned from the season so far, we&#x27;ve got to address the issues before Spa.&quot;

The race result left Michael Schumacher as the World Drivers&#x27; Champion with 94 points. Coulthard remained in second with 51 points. Third-placed Barrichello was five points behind Coulthard. Ralf Schumacher in fourth was a further two points behind Barrichello. With 21 points, Häkkinen was fifth. Ferrari won the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 140 points. McLaren in second (72 points) were 13 points ahead of Williams in third. Sauber were fourth with 20 points and the team increased their advantage over BAR to four points with four races remaining in the season. After his title victory, Michael Schumacher said he was still focused on winning races, and also considered helping his teammate Barrichello to finish second, something which Ferrari team principal Jean Todt reiterated.

<text>The 2001 Belgian Grand Prix (officially the 2001 Foster&#x27;s Belgian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held before 85,000 spectators at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Francorchamps, Wallonia, Belgium on 2 September 2001. It was the 14th round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 48th Belgian Grand Prix counting as part of the series. Ferrari driver and World Drivers&#x27; Champion Michael Schumacher won the 36-lap race starting from third. David Coulthard finished in second for McLaren with Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella third, scoring the final podium of the Benetton team.

Juan Pablo Montoya of the Williams team won the pole position by recording the fastest lap in qualifying; he stalled on the grid and forfeited pole. His teammate Ralf Schumacher lost the lead to Michael Schumacher into Les Combes turn. Michael Schumacher led the next four laps before the race was stopped for an accident involving Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine and Luciano Burti of Prost on lap five. The race was declared null and void and recommenced with a revised distance of 36 laps. Michael Schumacher led every lap of the restarted race to take his eighth victory of the season. Schumacher overtook the four-time world champion Alain Prost&#x27;s all-time career wins total with his 52nd, a record he held until Lewis Hamilton surpassed it at the 2020 Portuguese Grand Prix.

Burti was kept in hospital with facial bruising and a concussion until 10 September; his accident helped enhance helmet safety. The race result allowed Coulthard to further his World Drivers&#x27; Championship advantage over the second Ferrari driver of Rubens Barrichello by four points in second position. Barrichello in turn moved another two points clear of fourth-placed Ralf Schumacher. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren in second moved further ahead of Williams in third by nine points as Jordan passed British American Racing (BAR) for fifth with three races left in the season.

==Background==

The 2001 Belgian Grand Prix was the 14th of the 17 races in the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 48th running of the event as part of the series. It took place at the 21-turn Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Francorchamps, Wallonia, Belgium on 2 September. While the track&#x27;s length has been reduced from for safety reasons, it is still the longest in Formula One. It contains a number of fast and long sweeping corners along with a high degree of gradient change, which puts a high amount of g-force on the driver.

Before the race, both the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and World Constructors&#x27; Championship were already settled, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having claimed both titles in the preceding Hungarian Grand Prix, with their nearest rivals McLaren too many points behind to be able to catch them. Several positions in the standings were undecided. In the battle for second place, David Coulthard of McLaren was five points in front of the second Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello in third and a further two ahead of Williams&#x27; Ralf Schumacher in fourth. In the Constructors&#x27; standings, McLaren in second were 13 points ahead of Williams, while Sauber and British American Racing (BAR) contended for fourth.

Although a crash during testing at the Mugello Circuit left him with a sore neck, doctors deemed Michael Schumacher fit to compete in Belgium. He stated that he would be unwilling to be concentrated in his driving, and did not say when he felt he would surpass four-time world champion Alain Prost&#x27;s all-time record of 51 race victories, which he equalled in Hungary. Coulthard said he set himself the objective of winning the season &#x27;s final four races to consolidate second in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Barrichello stated he had also targeted second and his teammate Michael Schumacher promised to help him, saying, &quot;For me the season has just started.&quot;

There were 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) of two drivers each entered for the Grand Prix. Several teams modified their cars to suit the mid-downforce setup of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Williams debuted a lighter and stiffer chassis by for driver Ralf Schumacher with a revised aerodynamic package for better airflow to the FW23. Ferrari introduced a new front wing to the F2001 that was built upon a set of solutions tested in the previous race and adapted to suit the layout of the track. The Jordan team reverted to the aerodynamic configuration they used for the EJ11 at the preceding Hungarian Grand Prix. Prost adopted a new rear suspension geometry with a deformable structure and a new semi-axle structure, characterised by a large extractor profile. Benetton, Arrows and Jaguar carried over technical innovations developed for use in Hungary to Belgium, while Minardi manufactured a new chassis, the PS01B, which featured a revised rear crash structure and gearbox.

==Practice==

There were four scheduled practice sessions prior to Sunday&#x27;s race, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday practice sessions were held in cool and overcast conditions that turned to a downpour in the afternoon, causing several drivers to aquaplane on the wet track. In the first practice session, Michael Schumacher was fastest with a lap of 1 minute, 48.655 seconds, followed by Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Barrichello, Mika Häkkinen of McLaren, Ralf Schumacher, Jean Alesi in the second Jordan, the Saubers of Kimi Räikkönen and Nick Heidfeld, Juan Pablo Montoya of Williams and Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s Benetton. Coulthard lost control of his car by running wide onto sodden dirt, hitting a kerb at the exit of Les Fagnes corner, a right-hander taken at and collided with a left-hand side metal barrier head-on, tearing the right-front wheel from his car&#x27;s tethers. His damaged car skidded backwards along the wall before stopping. Coulthard clambered out of the car unhurt; he missed the second practice session while it was repaired.

Michael Schumacher recorded the day&#x27;s quickest lap in the second session at 1 minute, 48.655 seconds. Trulli did not improve his lap but duplicated his first session result in second. Barrichello remained in third, with Fisichella was fourth-fastest, ahead of Häkkinen and his compatriot Räikkönen. Ralf Schumacher, Jaguar driver Eddie Irvine, Alesi and Benetton&#x27;s Jenson Button rounded out the top ten fastest drivers. Rain fell came 16 minutes in and eased five minutes later. Button hit an armco metal barrier along the pit lane exiting the Bus Stop chicane. The impact damaged a track-rod on Button&#x27;s car. As Michael Schumacher was about to overtake Pedro de la Rosa&#x27;s Jaguar going downhill to Eau Rouge corner, he could not see him due to spray reducing visibility and he hit the rear of de la Rosa&#x27;s car. His front wing was broken and de la Rosa&#x27;s left-rear wheel was punctured. Montoya lost control of his car on a wet kerb and he damaged it after a spin into a tyre wall out of Les Combes corner.

The third practice session was delayed for two hours due to fog, rain showers and low clouds reducing visibility. Race organisers later cancelled it for safety reasons because the emergency medical helicopters were grounded in Liège. When the sky cleared at 10:00 local time, it was agreed by the Grand Prix organisers that a single 45-minute session would be held without practice starts to prevent a delay in television coverage for qualifying. Williams led the session with Montoya fastest with a 1-minute, 47.974 seconds lap and Ralf Schumacher in second. Häkkinen, Coulthard. Barrichello, Fisichella, Irvine, BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve, Button and Alesi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Several drivers ran off the slippery track surface during the session. De La Rosa, Irvine and Häkkinen went wide into the grass at the Bus Stop chicane, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen of the Prost team and Button ran off at Les Combes turn.

==Qualifying==
Saturday afternoon&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session saw drivers limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by their fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107 per cent of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race. Heavy rain at the start meant the field stayed in their garages for 26 minutes before cars on intermediate tyres ventured onto the track. By then, sunny weather allowed the track to progressively dry and cars were fitted with dry tyres in the last five minutes. Williams were the first team to switch their cars onto the dry tyres. Montoya traded the fastest lap with his teammate Ralf Schumacher and took the second pole position of his career with a 1-minute, 52.072 seconds lap, with Ralf Schumacher second. Michael Schumacher in third drove the spare Ferrari before switching to his race car when the track dried. Frentzen was hesitant to switch to the dry tyres until his team owner Alain Prost convinced him to do so and qualified fourth. Barrichello, fifth, used the intermediate tyres throughout. Villeneuve ran conservatively because he feared making an error and took sixth. Häkkinen qualified in seventh, bemoaning his conservative driving style due to the timing of the switch from intermediate to dry tyres. Eighth-placed Fisichella reported that the feel of his car was adequate in changeable weather. Coulthard fell from third to ninth in qualifying&#x27;s final seconds due to his team telling him there was insufficient time to have the dry tyres fitted to his car and traffic slowed him. De La Rosa, tenth, experienced a loss in oil pressure.

Panis in 11th was affected by an electrical fault that a change of steering wheel failed to rectify; his third timed lap was set too late to improve his position. Räikkönen was 6th in the final ten seconds until a reoccurring transmission fault left him in 12th. Alesi chose not to switch to the dry tyres and was 13th. Heidfeld in 14th had the same transmission fault as his teammate Räikkönen and yellow flags were waved when he stopped at Burneville corner. An excessive amount of oversteer and driving on intermediate tyres left Button in 15th. A lack of time to switch from the intermediate to dry tyres restricted Trulli to 16th. Irvine in 17th switched to the spare Jaguar because the exhaust on his car broke and the spare had excess understeer. 18th-placed Luciano Burti of Prost was delayed for half a minute because of a tyre pressure adjustment error that prevented him from improving his best lap. Jos Verstappen was 19th in the faster Arrows car. Irvine slowed him and a plan to do two timed laps did not come to fruition as he crossed the start/finish line three seconds after qualifying ended. Minardi&#x27;s Fernando Alonso started 20th due to him being on intermediate tyres at qualifying&#x27;s end. The Arrows and Minardi formation continued on the eleventh row with Enrique Bernoldi 21st after he lost time because he was called to the weighbridge with five minutes left and he ran out of fuel at the Bus Stop chicane. Tarso Marques took 22nd after Ralf Schumacher slowed him and his car&#x27;s rear suspension buckled on his fourth timed lap.

===Post-qualifying===
Verstappen, Alonso, Bernoldi and Marques failed to lap within the 107 per cent limit; all four drivers were allowed to start the race because the stewards deemed that there had been &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; owing to the changeable track conditions and also because they lapped within the limit during free practice. Afterwards, the McLaren team principal Ron Dennis lodged an official protest to the world governing body of motorsport, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), to clarify if the regulation barring drivers on improving their lap times under yellow flag conditions was consistent after 17 competitors went faster with yellow flags to tend to Heidfeld&#x27;s car. At a meeting of the race stewards eight hours later, data, information and oral arguments were reviewed and Dennis&#x27; protest was rejected. McLaren did not appeal the decision.

===Qualifying classification===

Notes: 
* Jos Verstappen, Fernando Alonso, Enrique Bernoldi and Tarso Marques all set their lap times outside the 107% limit, but were allowed to race due to heavy rain during qualifying.

==Warm-up==

A 30-minute warm-up session was held on Sunday morning in cloudy and dry weather. All drivers fine-tuned their race setups against the weather conditions of the time, and set laps in their spare cars. Michael Schumacher was fastest with a 1:49.495 lap, followed by Häkkinen, Räikkönen, Ralf Schumacher, Irvine, Frentzen, Montoya, Trulli, Heidfeld and Barrichello. Trulli removed his car&#x27;s front wing and bargeboards by running wide onto some bumps at Les Combes turn. He was unable to steer and stopped on a trackside wall. Alonso lost control of his car exiting Stavelot corner and destroyed its left-hand corner in a collision with an inside wall. He ricocheted to the right; Alonso exited the car unhurt with aid from track marshals, as Marques stopped to check if his teammate was unhurt. Alonso was transported to the track&#x27;s medical centre for a precautionary check-up. He was passed fit to compete in the race and used the spare Minardi car.

==Race==

===First start and Burti&#x27;s accident===
The race was attended by 85,000 spectators and took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time. The weather at the start was overcast and some light rain fell on the track 11 minutes before the formation lap. The air temperature was between and the track temperature was ; weather forecasts on the day of the race predicted the possibility of heavy rain in its latter stages. Before the formation lap was about to commence, Frentzen and Marques stalled because of gearbox problems. Both drivers were ordered to start from the back of the grid, causing the start to be aborted, and the number of laps reduced from 44 to 43. At the start of the second formation lap, Montoya was stationary as he engaged first gear. He forfeited pole position and began from the rear of the grid. His teammate Ralf Schumacher led on the approach to Les Combes corner as he locked his brakes. Barrichello kept third as Fisichella moved to fourth. Going uphill into Les Combes corner, Michael Schumacher pulled out of Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s slipstream and made a pass around the left for first place. Villeneuve fell behind the McLarens at the same time.

Button moved from 13th to ninth by the conclusion of the first lap, while Villeneuve fell four positions over the same distance. At the close of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led Ralf Schumacher by 2.1 seconds. Barrichello was a further six-tenths of a second behind Ralf Schumacher in third, while Fisichella in fourth was 2.2 seconds adrift of Barrichello. Over the next three laps, Michael Schumacher pulled away from the rest of the field, extending his advantage to 6.3 seconds. In the meantime, Alesi overtook de la Rosa and Panis to advance to 16th as Montoya passed Verstappen for 16th. On lap three, Fisichella lost fourth to Häkkinen into Les Combes corner, and a driver error at the exit to Rivage turn lost him fifth to Coulthard on the outside into Pouhon corner. Further back, Räikkönen braked later than Villeneuve at the Bus Stop chicane to move into seventh. Trulli passed Irvine for 14th. On the same lap, Alonso retired with a broken gearshaft. On the fourth lap, Alesi passed Button for ninth, as Heidfeld and Trulli demoted Panis from 12th to 14th. Irvine lost another position when Montoya passed him for 15th.

As Burti was about to pass Irvine on the inside at Blanchimont corner on lap five, Irvine was caught off guard and stayed on the racing line, putting Burti&#x27;s left-hand wheels onto the grass. Burti&#x27;s right-front wheel and Irvine&#x27;s Jaguar made contact. removing Burti&#x27;s front wing and downforce. Irvine drove over the Prost&#x27;s front wing and destroyed it. Burti was sent spearing across the gravel trap and into a four-deep tyre barrier at . The front of Burti&#x27;s full-face crash helmet broke as it took the full force of the impact. Further injury to Burti was prevented because a head and neck restraint absorbed the impact.

Irvine went off the track with the right-hand wheels removed from his Jaguar. He exited his car to assist the track marshals in removing the tyres pinned to Burti and released his car from the barrier. Räikkönen stopped with a transmission failure as Frentzen and Marques made pit stops. The safety car was deployed before the race was stopped. All the remaining drivers went on the starting grid to await the restart. Meanwhile, the FIA medical delegate Sid Watkins arrived to direct the extraction of Burti from his car. Burti was transported to the circuit&#x27;s medical centre by ambulance with no emergency treatment. After a medical inspection, he was flown by helicopter to the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Liège in a conscious and stable condition with a serious concussion.

===Restarted race===
According to series regulations, the first four laps were not counted towards the restarted race, the only retained element being the order the cars were in after the end of lap four, revising the distance to 36 laps and reducing the field to 18 cars. The race restarted at 14:45 local time. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Williams was not lowered from a jack at the start of the third formation lap because his mechanics immersed themselves with replacing a rear wing beam for safety reasons after Montoya&#x27;s rear wing broke. He avoided incurring a ten-second stop-and-go penalty and was required to start from the back of the grid. Fisichella made a fast start from sixth to pass the McLarens and Barrichello, but not Michael Schumacher for first into the La Source hairpin. Barrichello maintained third as Button moved to fourth, who did not have the necessary frontal grip to maintain his pace through the first corner. Coulthard was briefly ahead of Häkkinen before his teammate passed. Cresting a hill, both McLarens overtook Button as the BARs made contact and briefly drove off the circuit.

On the lap, after Verstappen hit him, Heidfeld attempted to pass de la Rosa on the left at the La Source hairpin. The two made contact with Heidfeld retiring immediately with front wing and suspension damage. De la Rosa entered the pit lane the lap after with car damage. Up front, Michael Schumacher began to pull away from the rest of the field, increasing his lead over Fisichella to five seconds by the third lap. One lap prior, Montoya&#x27;s car pulled to one side though he overtook four cars before he retired from an engine failure. On lap three, Trulli overtook Button for sixth. Button lost seventh to Alesi on the following lap. Michael Schumacher further extended his advantage to 14 seconds over Fisichella by lap six as Coulthard challenged the Benetton. Further back, Villeneuve passed Button for eighth. The first round of pit stops began at the conclusion of the lap when Trulli entered the pit lane. After his pit stop on lap seven, Panis crossed the white line to denote the pit lane exit, an infraction of the sporting regulations which entailed a ten-second stop-and-go penalty.

Barrichello made his first stop on the ninth lap. Michael Schumacher led the rest of the field by 20 seconds when he entered the pit lane for the first time on the next lap. He rejoined the race in second. Fisichella led before his own stop at the conclusion of the lap. He retained second place. Panis took his ten-second stop-and-go-penalty on the 12th lap. After the pit stops, the Grand Prix settled into a rhythm with Michael Schumacher further extending his advantage over Fisichella to 24.8 seconds by lap 15. At the rear of the field, Marques made an unscheduled visit to the pit lane for repairs to his suspension. Two laps later, Michael Schumacher lost concentration as he steered his Ferrari to the left at Stavelot turn and ran wide after missing the apex of the corner. He rejoined the track without losing the lead. His teammate Barrichello hit a trackside bollard entering the Bus Stop chicane on lap 17. His car lost front downforce from removing his front wing and he completed a full lap at reduced speed after missing the pit lane entry. Barrichello rejoined the race in ninth.

On lap 18, while under pressure from Ralf Schumacher, Button struck a plastic bollard marker denoting the left-hand kerb situated on the entry to the Bus Stop Chicane. The contact removed his front wing which folded under his front-left wheel and the lack of downforce sent him into the outside barrier. Trulli entered the pit lane on the following lap to begin the second round of pit stops. His teammate Alesi followed on lap 20. Fisichella was six-tenths of a second ahead of Coulthard in third by the time of his second stop on lap 23. Fisichella&#x27;s car sprayed oil on Coulthard, causing the McLaren driver to clean his visor on the main straights. Coulthard made his stop the lap after, and emerged in third behind Fisichella. Michael Schumacher led by 43.6 seconds by the time of his second pit stop at the end of lap 25 and he retained the lead. On lap 26, Coulthard steered left to attempt an unsuccessful overtake on Fisichella. Häkkinen ran wide entering the Bus Stop chicane on lap 27, rejoining the track through the grass. On the next lap, Fisichella lost momentum while lapping Bernoldi, and Coulthard steered left to pass but Fisichella defended at the La Source hairpin. Coulthard tried again by slipstreaming Fisichella in Eau Rouge corner and passed him on the right for second.

On lap 29, Ralf Schumacher overtook Villeneuve for eighth. Three laps later, Barrichello passed Alesi on the straight towards Les Combes corner for sixth. Jordan lost one of its EJ11s on the lap when the fifth-placed Trulli drove to the side of the track with oil smoke billowing from the rear of his car. In the final three laps, Ralf Schumacher attempted to pass Alesi five times and was unsuccessful each time. At the front, Coulthard reduced Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead by a second per lap, as the latter slowed, but Schumacher took his fifth win at the Circuit de-Spa Francorchamps to equal the triple world champion Ayrton Senna&#x27;s record number of wins at the track. It was his eighth victory of 2001 and the 52nd of his career, overtaking the four-time world champion Alain Prost&#x27;s all-time record of 51 wins. Coulthard followed 10.098 seconds later in second and Fisichella finished a season-high third. Häkkinen took fourth, Barrichello fifth and Alesi was the last of the point-scorers in sixth. The final finishers were Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, Frentzen, Verstappen, Panis, Bernoldi and Marques.

==Post-race==
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Michael Schumacher said he slowed to be conservative, &quot;For whatever reason, I thought I had the chance to open up the gap for an extra pit and we didn&#x27;t know whether they would do so I just wanted to have that safety margin because I was faster than Giancarlo and David couldn&#x27;t get by I was able to open up such a lead.&quot; He said that his 52nd win had no priority, saying, &quot;Actually I&#x27;m very delighted about this but I will be much more delighted sitting one day on the sofa, retired, and I have a cigar and beer in hand and think about it.&quot; Coulthard admitted being surprised over Fisichella&#x27;s pace. He said he was pleased to finish second and increase his World Drivers&#x27; Championship advantage over Barrichello, &quot;Given the weekend I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m obviously very happy to have got second place, hoping that Luciano is 100 per cent and able to do the next race, and then we can all feel it&#x27;s been a positive weekend.&quot; Fisichella attributed his third-place result to the new aerodynamic package on his Benetton that gave him improved grip and handling, &quot;We did a very good job. I did two amazing starts, especially the second one from sixth position to second, and I&#x27;m happy. It&#x27;s a great day, and I&#x27;d like to say thank you to the team.&quot;

After the race, the stewards investigated the collision between Irvine and Burti on lap five by reviewing television footage and listening to Irvine&#x27;s oral explanation. They took no further action and deemed it &quot;a racing incident&quot;, with neither driver in particular to blame. It was the second major accident Burti had sustained in more than a month as he barrel rolled twice after colliding with the rear of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s car at the start of the German Grand Prix in July 2001. The accident was a talking point for days after the race, with Alain Prost noting that Burti&#x27;s impact would have been fatal about ten years earlier, and former driver Jacques Laffite praised the strength of the modern Formula One car&#x27;s monocoque. The Jaguar team principal Niki Lauda told the press he was unhappy with the inaction and conduct of the track marshals, &quot;The marshals were not operating properly. Eddie had to take over and basically tell them what to do. He was really part of the rescue there, which normally drivers shouldn&#x27;t do but he had to do it, since they didn&#x27;t seem to have an idea what they need to do.&quot; Irvine said he had not seen Burti attempting to pass him on the outside but was relieved that Burti was conscious.

Burti sustained facial and head bruising and he underwent a brain scan, which revealed a head injury though no swelling of the brain. Gary Hartstein, a member of the FIA&#x27;s medical delegation, predicted that Burti would take up to two months to complete a full recovery. Burti underwent further tests and was placed in an induced coma until he left intensive care on 4 September. He was discharged from hospital six days later and returned to Monaco to continue his recuperation. Burti was replaced by the Czech International Formula 3000 driver Tomáš Enge for the rest of the season. He stated in subsequent interviews that he cannot recall the crash. The effects of the accident caused Burti to suffer from seizures and amnesia for the next four months, both of which required medication. The FIA analysed the accident to enhance safety and outlawed the creation of holes in helmets allowing drinking tubes and radio communication wires to pass through. The incident was used as a case study in the development of the halo. In an interview with &quot;Autosport&quot; in 2019, Burti attributed his survival to vehicle and circuit safety improvements made after Ayrton Senna&#x27;s fatal accident at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

Frank Williams, the team principal of the Williams squad, stated that they made an error in keeping Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s car on a jack at the start of the third formation lap and that nobody could be blamed for it. Button said of his accident that caused him to retire from the race on lap 18, &quot;The car was fine when I turned left, but it didn&#x27;t want to turn right because the wing had fallen under my wheels, and so I hit the wall.&quot; The result left Coulthard nine points in front of Barrichello in the battle for second while the latter moved a further two points clear of Ralf Schumacher. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren moved further away from Williams by another nine points, while Jordan moved past BAR for fifth with three races left in the season.

<text>Diffusion of innovations is a theory that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread. The theory was popularized by Everett Rogers in his book &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot;, first published in 1962. Rogers argues that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the participants in a social system. The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines.

Rogers proposes that five main elements influence the spread of a new idea: the innovation itself, adopters, communication channels, time, and a social system. This process relies heavily on social capital. The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain. Within the rate of adoption, there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass. In 1989, management consultants working at the consulting firm Regis McKenna, Inc. theorized that this point lies at the boundary between the early adopters and the early majority. This gap between niche appeal and mass (self-sustained) adoption was originally labeled &quot;the marketing chasm&quot;.

The categories of adopters are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Diffusion manifests itself in different ways and is highly subject to the type of adopters and innovation-decision process. The criterion for the adopter categorization is innovativeness, defined as the degree to which an individual adopts a new idea.

== History ==

The concept of diffusion was first studied by the French sociologist Gabriel Tarde in late 19th century and by German and Austrian anthropologists and geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel and Leo Frobenius. The study of diffusion of innovations took off in the subfield of rural sociology in the midwestern United States in the 1920s and 1930s. Agriculture technology was advancing rapidly, and researchers started to examine how independent farmers were adopting hybrid seeds, equipment, and techniques. A study of the adoption of hybrid corn seed in Iowa by Ryan and Gross (1943) solidified the prior work on diffusion into a distinct paradigm that would be cited consistently in the future. Since its start in rural sociology, Diffusion of Innovations has been applied to numerous contexts, including medical sociology, communications, marketing, development studies, health promotion, organizational studies, knowledge management, conservation biology and complexity studies, with a particularly large impact on the use of medicines, medical techniques, and health communications. In organizational studies, its basic epidemiological or internal-influence form was formulated by H. Earl Pemberton, such as postage stamps and standardized school ethics codes.

In 1962, Everett Rogers, a professor of rural sociology at Ohio State University, published his seminal work: &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot;. Rogers synthesized research from over 508 diffusion studies across the fields that initially influenced the theory: anthropology, early sociology, rural sociology, education, industrial sociology and medical sociology. Rogers applied it to the healthcare setting to address issues with hygiene, cancer prevention, family planning, and drunk driving. Using his synthesis, Rogers produced a theory of the adoption of innovations among individuals and organizations. &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot; and Rogers&#x27; later books are among the most often cited in diffusion research. His methodologies are closely followed in recent diffusion research, even as the field has expanded into, and been influenced by, other methodological disciplines such as social network analysis and communication.

==Elements==
The key elements in diffusion research are:
===Characteristics of innovations===
Studies have explored many characteristics of innovations. Meta-reviews have identified several characteristics that are common among most studies. These are in line with the characteristics that Rogers initially cited in his reviews.

Rogers describes five characteristics that potential adopters evaluate when deciding whether to adopt an innovation:

# Compatibility: How well does this innovation fit with existing values, patterns of behavior, or tools? 
# Trialability: Can you try it before you buy it?
# Relative advantage: In what way is this innovation better than the alternatives?
# Observability: Are its benefits noticeable? If someone else is using the innovation, can I see it being used? 
# Simplicity / Complexity: The easier it is to learn or grasp, the faster it diffuses.

These qualities interact and are judged as a whole. For example, an innovation might be extremely complex, reducing its likelihood to be adopted and diffused, but it might be very compatible with a large advantage relative to current tools. Even with this high learning curve, potential adopters might adopt the innovation anyway.

Studies also identify other characteristics of innovations, but these are not as common as the ones that Rogers lists above. The fuzziness of the boundaries of the innovation can impact its adoption. Specifically, innovations with a small core and large periphery are easier to adopt. Innovations that are less risky are easier to adopt as the potential loss from failed integration is lower. Innovations that are disruptive to routine tasks, even when they bring a large relative advantage, might not be adopted because of added instability. Likewise, innovations that make tasks easier are likely to be adopted. Closely related to relative complexity, knowledge requirements are the ability barrier to use presented by the difficulty to use the innovation. Even when there are high knowledge requirements, support from prior adopters or other sources can increase the chances for adoption.

===Characteristics of individual adopters===
Like innovations, adopters have been determined to have traits that affect their likelihood to adopt an innovation. A bevy of individual personality traits have been explored for their impacts on adoption, but with little agreement. Ability and motivation, which vary on situation unlike personality traits, have a large impact on a potential adopter&#x27;s likelihood to adopt an innovation. Unsurprisingly, potential adopters who are motivated to adopt an innovation are likely to make the adjustments needed to adopt it. Motivation can be impacted by the meaning that an innovation holds; innovations can have symbolic value that encourage (or discourage) adoption. First proposed by Ryan and Gross (1943), the overall connectedness of a potential adopter to the broad community represented by a city. Potential adopters who frequent metropolitan areas are more likely to adopt an innovation. Finally, potential adopters who have the power or agency to create change, particularly in organizations, are more likely to adopt an innovation than someone with less power over his choices.

Complementary to the diffusion framework, behavioral models such as Technology acceptance model (TAM) and Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) are frequently used to understand individual technology adoption decisions in greater details.

===Characteristics of organizations===
Organizations face more complex adoption possibilities because organizations are both the aggregate of its individuals and its own system with a set of procedures and norms. Three organizational characteristics match well with the individual characteristics above: tension for change (motivation and ability), innovation-system fit (compatibility), and assessment of implications (observability). Organizations can feel pressured by a tension for change. If the organization&#x27;s situation is untenable, it will be motivated to adopt an innovation to change its fortunes. This tension often plays out among its individual members. Innovations that match the organization&#x27;s pre-existing system require fewer coincidental changes and are easy to assess and more likely to be adopted. The wider environment of the organization, often an industry, community, or economy, exerts pressures on the organization, too. Where an innovation is diffusing through the organization&#x27;s environment for any reason, the organization is more likely to adopt it. Innovations that are intentionally spread, including by political mandate or directive, are also likely to diffuse quickly.

Unlike individual decisions where behavioral models (e.g. TAM and UTAUT) can be used to complement the diffusion framework and reveal further details, these models are not directly applicable to organizational decisions. However, research suggested that simple behavioral models can still be used as a good predictor of organizational technology adoption when proper initial screening procedures are introduced.

== Process ==

Diffusion occurs through a five–step decision-making process. It occurs through a series of communication channels over a period of time among the members of a similar social system. Ryan and Gross first identified adoption as a process in 1943. Rogers&#x27; five stages (steps): awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption are integral to this theory. An individual might reject an innovation at any time during or after the adoption process. Abrahamson examined this process critically by posing questions such as: How do technically inefficient innovations diffuse and what impedes technically efficient innovations from catching on? Abrahamson makes suggestions for how organizational scientists can more comprehensively evaluate the spread of innovations. In later editions of &quot;Diffusion of Innovation&quot;, Rogers changes his terminology of the five stages to: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. However, the descriptions of the categories have remained similar throughout the editions.

== Decisions ==

Two factors determine what type a particular decision is:

* Whether the decision is made freely and implemented voluntarily
* Who makes the decision

Based on these considerations, three types of innovation-decisions have been identified.

== Rate of adoption ==

The rate of adoption is defined as the relative speed at which participants adopt an innovation. Rate is usually measured by the length of time required for a certain percentage of the members of a social system to adopt an innovation. The rates of adoption for innovations are determined by an individual&#x27;s adopter category. In general, individuals who first adopt an innovation require a shorter adoption period (adoption process) when compared to late adopters.

Within the adoption curve at some point the innovation reaches critical mass. This is when the number of individual adopters ensures that the innovation is self-sustaining.

=== Adoption strategies ===

Rogers outlines several strategies in order to help an innovation reach this stage, including when an innovation adopted by a highly respected individual within a social network and creating an instinctive desire for a specific innovation. Another strategy includes injecting an innovation into a group of individuals who would readily use said technology, as well as providing positive reactions and benefits for early adopters.

=== Diffusion vis-à-vis adoption ===

Adoption is an individual process detailing the series of stages one undergoes from first hearing about a product to finally adopting it. Diffusion signifies a group phenomenon, which suggests how an innovation spreads.

==Adopter categories==
Rogers defines an adopter category as a classification of individuals within a social system on the basis of innovativeness. In the book &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot;, Rogers suggests a total of five categories of adopters in order to standardize the usage of adopter categories in diffusion research. The adoption of an innovation follows an S curve when plotted over a length of time. The categories of adopters are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. In addition to the gatekeepers and opinion leaders who exist within a given community, change agents may come from outside the community. Change agents bring innovations to new communities – first through the gatekeepers, then through the opinion leaders, and so on through the community.

== Failed diffusion ==

Failed diffusion does not mean that the technology was adopted by no one. Rather, failed diffusion often refers to diffusion that does not reach or approach 100% adoption due to its own weaknesses, competition from other innovations, or simply a lack of awareness. From a social networks perspective, a failed diffusion might be widely adopted within certain clusters but fail to make an impact on more distantly related people. Networks that are over-connected might suffer from a rigidity that prevents the changes an innovation might bring, as well.
Sometimes, some innovations also fail as a result of lack of local involvement and community participation.

For example, Rogers discussed a situation in Peru involving the implementation of boiling drinking water to improve health and wellness levels in the village of Los Molinos. The residents had no knowledge of the link between sanitation and illness. The campaign worked with the villagers to try to teach them to boil water, burn their garbage, install latrines and report cases of illness to local health agencies. In Los Molinos, a stigma was linked to boiled water as something that only the &quot;unwell&quot; consumed, and thus, the idea of healthy residents boiling water prior to consumption was frowned upon. The two-year educational campaign was considered to be largely unsuccessful. This failure exemplified the importance of the roles of the communication channels that are involved in such a campaign for social change. An examination of diffusion in El Salvador determined that there can be more than one social network at play as innovations are communicated. One network carries information and the other carries influence. While people might hear of an innovation&#x27;s uses, in Rogers&#x27; Los Molinos sanitation case, a network of influence and status prevented adoption.

== Heterophily and communication channels ==

Lazarsfeld and Merton first called attention to the principles of homophily and its opposite, heterophily. Using their definition, Rogers defines homophily as &quot;the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar in certain attributes, such as beliefs, education, social status, and the like&quot;. When given the choice, individuals usually choose to interact with someone similar to themselves. Homophilous individuals engage in more effective communication because their similarities lead to greater knowledge gain as well as attitude or behavior change. As a result, homophilous people tend to promote diffusion among each other. However, diffusion requires a certain degree of heterophily to introduce new ideas into a relationship; if two individuals are identical, no diffusion occurs because there is no new information to exchange. Therefore, an ideal situation would involve potential adopters who are homophilous in every way, except in knowledge of the innovation.

Promotion of healthy behavior provides an example of the balance required of homophily and heterophily. People tend to be close to others of similar health status. As a result, people with unhealthy behaviors like smoking and obesity are less likely to encounter information and behaviors that encourage good health. This presents a critical challenge for health communications, as ties between heterophilous people are relatively weaker, harder to create, and harder to maintain. Developing heterophilous ties to unhealthy communities can increase the effectiveness of the diffusion of good health behaviors. Once one previously homophilous tie adopts the behavior or innovation, the other members of that group are more likely to adopt it, too.

== Role of social systems ==

=== Opinion leaders ===

Not all individuals exert an equal amount of influence over others. In this sense opinion leaders are influential in spreading either positive or negative information about an innovation. Rogers relies on the ideas of Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld and the two-step flow theory in developing his ideas on the influence of opinion leaders.

Opinion leaders have the most influence during the evaluation stage of the innovation-decision process and on late adopters. In addition opinion leaders typically have greater exposure to the mass media, more cosmopolitan, greater contact with change agents, more social experience and exposure, higher socioeconomic status, and are more innovative than others.

Research was done in the early 1950s at the University of Chicago attempting to assess the cost-effectiveness of broadcast advertising on the diffusion of new products and services. The findings were that opinion leadership tended to be organized into a hierarchy within a society, with each level in the hierarchy having most influence over other members in the same level, and on those in the next level below it. The lowest levels were generally larger in numbers and tended to coincide with various demographic attributes that might be targeted by mass advertising. However, it found that direct word of mouth and example were far more influential than broadcast messages, which were only effective if they reinforced the direct influences. This led to the conclusion that advertising was best targeted, if possible, on those next in line to adopt, and not on those not yet reached by the chain of influence.

Research on actor-network theory (ANT) also identifies a significant overlap between the ANT concepts and the diffusion of innovation which examine the characteristics of innovation and its context among various interested parties within a social system to assemble a network or system which implements innovation.

Other research relating the concept to public choice theory finds that the hierarchy of influence for innovations need not, and likely does not, coincide with hierarchies of official, political, or economic status. Elites are often not innovators, and innovations may have to be introduced by outsiders and propagated up a hierarchy to the top decision makers.

=== Electronic communication social networks ===

Prior to the introduction of the Internet, it was argued that social networks had a crucial role in the diffusion of innovation particularly tacit knowledge in the book &quot;The IRG Solution – hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it&quot;. The book argued that the widespread adoption of computer networks of individuals would lead to much better diffusion of innovations, with greater understanding of their possible shortcomings and the identification of needed innovations that would not have otherwise occurred. The social model proposed by Ryan and Gross is expanded by Valente who uses social networks as a basis for adopter categorization instead of solely relying on the system-level analysis used by Ryan and Gross. Valente also looks at an individual&#x27;s personal network, which is a different application than the organizational perspective espoused by many other scholars.

Recent research by Wear shows, that particularly in regional and rural areas, significantly more innovation takes place in communities which have stronger inter-personal networks.

=== Organizations ===

Innovations are often adopted by organizations through two types of innovation-decisions: collective innovation decisions and authority innovation decisions. The collective decision occurs when adoption is by consensus. The authority decision occurs by adoption among very few individuals with high positions of power within an organization. Unlike the optional innovation decision process, these decision processes only occur within an organization or hierarchical group. Research indicated that, with proper initial screening procedures, even simple behavioral model can serve as a good predictor for technology adoption in many commercial organizations. Within an organization certain individuals are termed &quot;champions&quot; who stand behind an innovation and break through opposition. The champion plays a very similar role as the champion used within the efficiency business model Six Sigma. The process contains five stages that are slightly similar to the innovation-decision process that individuals undertake. These stages are: agenda-setting, matching, redefining/restructuring, clarifying and routinizing.

== Extensions of the theory==

=== Policy ===

Diffusion of Innovations has been applied beyond its original domains.
In the case of political science and administration, policy diffusion focuses on how institutional innovations are adopted by other institutions, at the local, state, or country level. An alternative term is &#x27;policy transfer&#x27; where the focus is more on the agents of diffusion and the diffusion of policy knowledge, such as in the work of Diane Stone. Specifically, policy transfer can be defined as &quot;knowledge about how policies administrative arrangements, institutions, and ideas in one political setting (past or present) is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions, and ideas in another political setting&quot;.

The first interests with regards to policy diffusion were focused in time variation or state lottery adoption, but more recently interest has shifted towards mechanisms (emulation, learning and coercion) or in channels of diffusion where researchers find that regulatory agency creation is transmitted by country and sector channels. At the local level, examining popular city-level policies make it easy to find patterns in diffusion through measuring public awareness. At the international level, economic policies have been thought to transfer among countries according to local politicians&#x27; learning of successes and failures elsewhere and outside mandates made by global financial organizations. As a group of countries succeed with a set of policies, others follow, as exemplified by the deregulation and liberalization across the developing world after the successes of the Asian Tigers. The reintroduction of regulations in the early 2000s also shows this learning process, which would fit under the stages of knowledge and decision, can be seen as lessons learned by following China&#x27;s successful growth.

=== Technology ===

Peres, Muller and Mahajan suggested that diffusion is &quot;the process of the market penetration of new products and services that is driven by social influences, which include all interdependencies among consumers that affect various market players with or without their explicit knowledge&quot;.

Eveland evaluated diffusion from a phenomenological view, stating, &quot;Technology is information, and exists only to the degree that people can put it into practice and use it to achieve values&quot;.

Diffusion of existing technologies has been measured using &quot;S curves&quot;. These technologies include radio, television, VCR, cable, flush toilet, clothes washer, refrigerator, home ownership, air conditioning, dishwasher, electrified households, telephone, cordless phone, cellular phone, per capita airline miles, personal computer and the Internet. These data can act as a predictor for future innovations.

Diffusion curves for infrastructure reveal contrasts in the diffusion process of personal technologies versus infrastructure.

== Consequences of adoption ==

Both positive and negative outcomes are possible when an individual or organization chooses to adopt a particular innovation. Rogers states that this area needs further research because of the biased positive attitude that is associated with innovation. Rogers lists three categories for consequences: desirable vs. undesirable, direct vs. indirect, and anticipated vs. unanticipated.

In contrast Wejnert details two categories: public vs. private and benefits vs. costs.

=== Public vis-à-vis private ===

Public consequences comprise the impact of an innovation on those other than the actor, while private consequences refer to the impact on the actor. Public consequences usually involve collective actors, such as countries, states, organizations or social movements. The results are usually concerned with issues of societal well-being. Private consequences usually involve individuals or small collective entities, such as a community. The innovations are usually concerned with the improvement of quality of life or the reform of organizational or social structures.

=== Benefits vis-à-vis costs ===

Benefits of an innovation obviously are the positive consequences, while the costs are the negative. Costs may be monetary or nonmonetary, direct or indirect. Direct costs are usually related to financial uncertainty and the economic state of the actor. Indirect costs are more difficult to identify. An example would be the need to buy a new kind of pesticide to use innovative seeds. Indirect costs may also be social, such as social conflict caused by innovation. Marketers are particularly interested in the diffusion process as it determines the success or failure of a new product. It is quite important for a marketer to understand the diffusion process so as to ensure proper management of the spread of a new product or service.

=== Intended vis-à-vis Unintended ===

The diffusion of innovations theory has been used to conduct research on the unintended consequences of new interventions in public health. In the book multiple examples of the unintended negative consequences of technological diffusion are given. The adoption of automatic tomato pickers developed by Midwest agricultural colleges led to the adoption of harder tomatoes (disliked by consumers) and the loss of thousands of jobs leading to the collapse of thousands of small farmers. In another example, the adoption of snowmobiles in Saami reindeer herding culture is found to lead to the collapse of their society with widespread alcoholism and unemployment for the herders, ill-health for the reindeer (such as stress ulcers, miscarriages) and a huge increase in inequality.

== Mathematical treatment ==
The diffusion of an innovation typically follows an S-shaped curve which often resembles a logistic function. Roger&#x27;s diffusion model concludes that the popularity of a new product will grow with time to a saturation level and then decline, but it cannot predict how much time it will take and what the saturation level will be. Bass (1969) and many other researchers proposed modeling the diffusion based on parametric formulas to fill this gap and to provide a means for a quantitative forecast of adoption timing and levels. The Bass model focuses on the first two (Introduction and Growth). Some of the Bass-Model extensions present mathematical models for the last two (Maturity and Decline). MS-Excel or other tools can be used to solve the Bass model equations, and other diffusion models equations, numerically. Mathematical programming models such as the S-D model apply the diffusion of innovations theory to real data problems. In addition to that, agent-based models follow a more intuitive process by designing individual-level rules to model the diffusion of ideas and innovations.

=== Complex systems models ===

Complex network models can also be used to investigate the spread of innovations among individuals connected to each other by a network of peer-to-peer influences, such as in a physical community or neighborhood.

Such models represent a system of individuals as &quot;nodes&quot; in a network (or graph). The interactions that link these individuals are represented by the edges of the network and can be based on the probability or strength of social connections. In the dynamics of such models, each node is assigned a current state, indicating whether or not the individual has adopted the innovation, and model equations describe the evolution of these states over time.

In threshold models, the uptake of technologies is determined by the balance of two factors: the (perceived) usefulness (sometimes called utility) of the innovation to the individual as well as barriers to adoption, such as cost. The multiple parameters that influence decisions to adopt, both individual and socially motivated, can be represented by such models as a series of nodes and connections that represent real relationships. Borrowing from social network analysis, each node is an innovator, an adopter, or a potential adopter. Potential adopters have a threshold, which is a fraction of his neighbors who adopt the innovation that must be reached before he will adopt. Over time, each potential adopter views his neighbors and decides whether he should adopt based on the technologies they are using. When the effect of each individual node is analyzed along with its influence over the entire network, the expected level of adoption was seen to depend on the number of initial adopters and the network&#x27;s structure and properties. Two factors emerge as important to successful spread of the innovation: the number of connections of nodes with their neighbors and the presence of a high degree of common connections in the network (quantified by the clustering coefficient). These models are particularly good at showing the impact of opinion leaders relative to others. Computer models are often used to investigate this balance between the social aspects of diffusion and perceived intrinsic benefit to the individuals.

== Criticism ==

Even though there have been more than four thousand articles across many disciplines published on Diffusion of Innovations, with a vast majority written after Rogers created a systematic theory, there have been few widely adopted changes to the theory. Although each study applies the theory in slightly different ways, critics say this lack of cohesion has left the theory stagnant and difficult to apply with consistency to new problems.

Diffusion is difficult to quantify because humans and human networks are complex. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to measure what exactly causes adoption of an innovation. This variety of variables has also led to inconsistent results in research, reducing heuristic value.

Rogers placed the contributions and criticisms of diffusion research into four categories: pro-innovation bias, individual-blame bias, recall problem, and issues of equality. The pro-innovation bias, in particular, implies that all innovation is positive and that all innovations should be adopted. Cultural traditions and beliefs can be consumed by another culture&#x27;s through diffusion, which can impose significant costs on a group of people. The one-way information flow, from sender to receiver, is another weakness of this theory. The message sender has a goal to persuade the receiver, and there is little to no reverse flow. The person implementing the change controls the direction and outcome of the campaign. In some cases, this is the best approach, but other cases require a more participatory approach. In complex environments where the adopter is receiving information from many sources and is returning feedback to the sender, a one-way model is insufficient and multiple communication flows need to be examined.

<text>The 2001 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Gran Premio Campari d&#x27;Italia 2001) was a Formula One motor race held before around 95,000 to 110,000 spectators on 16 September 2001 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza near Monza, Lombardy, Italy. It was the 15th round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 72nd Italian Grand Prix. Rookie Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya won the 53-lap race from pole position. Rubens Barrichello finished second in a Ferrari with Montoya&#x27;s teammate Ralf Schumacher third.

Montoya maintained his start-line advantage and led until he exited a chicane slowly due to a tyre blister and was overtaken by Barrichello on the ninth lap. Barrichello pulled away from Montoya and held the lead until his first of two pit stops on lap 19 which proved problematic because of a faulty refuelling rig that had been reprogrammed. Montoya was put a one-stop strategy by his team and made a pit stop on lap 29, which allowed his teammate Ralf Schumacher to lead the race for six laps. Barrichello regained the lead on lap 36, and held it for six more laps until Montoya took over the position on lap 42 when Barrichello made a pit stop for the second time for fuel. Barrichello started to reduce the gap between himself and Montoya but was unable to challenge the Williams driver who achieved his maiden Formula One victory and the first for a Colombian driver.

The result meant Montoya moved into fifth position in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who clinched the title two races beforehand at the . Barrichello&#x27;s second position finish allowed him to close the gap to David Coulthard in second place in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Williams&#x27; strong finish meant the gap between themselves and McLaren was reduced to eight points in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with two races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2001 Italian Grand Prix was the 15th of the 17 round 2001 Formula One World Championship and occurred at the clockwise Monza Circuit close to Monza, Lombardy, Italy on 16 September. Before the race, both the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and World Constructors&#x27; Championship were already settled, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship two rounds earlier in the and Ferrari took the World Constructors&#x27; Championship at the same event, with McLaren too many points behind to be able to catch them.

After the on 2 September, the teams conducted mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September to prepare for the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR&#x27;s Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute, 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team&#x27;s private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.

After the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington D.C., Formula One&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) announced that the Italian Grand Prix would go ahead as scheduled. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said that his team would approach the race as a normal racing event instead of a traditional Ferrari festival. Furthermore, di Montezemolo stated Formula One should continue its normal schedule and not cancel races. Additionally, the Automobile Club d&#x27;Italia urged fans and spectators to behave &quot;in keeping with the gravity of the situation and in collective participation in the pain of American citizens.&quot; Podium celebrations were also cancelled and all pre-race ceremonies including a flypast by the Italian Tricolour Arrows display team were called off. Three teams altered their car&#x27;s liveries as a mark of respect. Ferrari stripped their cars of all advertising and painted their nose cones black. Jaguar fitted black engine covers to their R2 cars on Saturday morning, and Jordan sponsor Deutsche Post replaced its branding with the flag of the United States on the Jordan cars engine cover on Sunday morning. Michael Schumacher was reluctant to take part in the race and said in 2002 that he felt it was a &quot;bad sign&quot; to be driving after the 11 September attacks. His brother Ralf Schumacher also felt the event should not have gone ahead.

Williams&#x27; Juan Pablo Montoya felt Monza would suit his car&#x27;s BMW engine, saying: &quot;We should be really quick, but we will have to see what happens. The most important thing, as we have seen in qualifying in Spa, is to get the car right. If we get it right we should be very quick.&quot; Michael Schumacher was intent to help his teammate Barrichello finish second in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and revealed that Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn had told him &quot;it doesn&#x27;t feel much difference this race to the others&quot;, adding, &quot;That is because we are still trying to keep winning races and that means the emotions, the pressures and the nervousness is pretty much the same, whether or not we have won the world championship.&quot;

There were 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) each fielding two drivers for the Grand Prix with two driver changes. The Minardi team replaced regular driver Tarso Marques with Yoong, who received backing from the Magnum Corporation and was granted a super licence after a two-day test at the Mugello Circuit, becoming Malaysia&#x27;s first Formula One driver. Marques was kept on as the team&#x27;s test and reserve driver, and assisted with developing the Minardi PS02. Czech Formula 3000 driver and Prost test driver Tomáš Enge replaced Luciano Burti who had been recovering from a concussion and facial bruising he sustained in an accident at the previous race in Belgium.

Due to the configuration of the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, with its high average speed, the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Ferrari installed Carbon Industrie brake discs instead of the normal Brembo brake discs the team had used. Williams introduced a revised FW23 specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium. Williams equipped the earlier aerodynamic package on Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s car on Sunday morning. Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a new engine specification with improved aerodynamics. The Jordan team introduced a new front wing characterised with a single profile instead of the normal two.

==Practice==

There were four practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. Team principals agreed in a meeting the day before the first practice session that it would was moved from the usual start time from 11:00 Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00) to 10:50 to comply with a planned silence for one minute observed at midday throughout Europe and continued the rest of the race weekend as scheduled. 

Michael Schumacher paced the first practice session in dry weather conditions, at 1:25.524; David Coulthard and Barrichello were second and third. Nick Heidfeld (who crashed his Sauber car into the wall at Variante Ascari with 15 minutes remaining) was fourth. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen and Benetton&#x27;s Jenson Button were fifth and sixth. Kimi Räikkönen, seventh, hit a barrier at Variante Goodyear chicane with half an hour remaining, removing his front-right wheel and his front wing after losing control of his Sauber car due to a brake lock-up and avoided Yoong&#x27;s stationary car entering the Curva Grande corner. Räikkönen was uninjured. Ralf Schumacher, Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli and Arrows&#x27; Pedro de la Rosa were in positions seven through ten. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen set no laps after colliding with the tyre barrier at the Curva di Lesmo on his first quick lap after ten minutes. 

In the second practice session, where a brief rain shower fell early on, Ralf Schumacher set the day&#x27;s fastest time after 13 minutes, a 1:24.667; Montoya had the second fastest time despite going off the circuit and having to go through temporary barriers at the first chicane multiple times during the session. Michael Schumacher, De La Rosa. Barrichello, Häkkinen and Coulthard filled the next four positions. Despite not going onto the circuit, Heidfeld was the eighth fastest driver. The Jordan duo of Jean Alesi and Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen (who hit a kerb in his Prost car and went off the circuit at the Variante della Roggia chicane and slid wide of the track and into the gravel) followed in the top ten. Eddie Irvine spun his Jaguar into the gravel at Ascari corner five minutes into the session due to brake problems and his session concluded prematurely.

Montoya recorded the third session&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:25.558 with fewer than ten minutes remaining in clear weather conditions but on a damp circuit that was created by a thunderstorm on Friday night which meant the track was slow to dry. Most drivers used intermediate tyres to begin the session before a dry line appeared and dry compound tyres were used. Barrichello was 0.336 seconds slower in second. De La Rosa, BAR drivers Villeneuve and Panis, Räikkönen, Irvine, Verstappen, Enrique Bernoldi for Arrows and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella, Yoong, Button, Alesi, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Häkkinen and Minardi&#x27;s Fernando Alonso set no laps during the session. 

The circuit continued to dry up until it was completely dry for the final practice session where Michael Schumacher set the weekend&#x27;s new fastest time at 1:23.178, faster than his 2000 pole lap; Barrichello had the quickest lap when circuit conditions improved but fell to fourth in the final ten minutes. The two Ferrari drivers were separated by Montoya and Trulli. Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher, Heidfeld, Häkkinen, De La Rosa and Räikkönen were in positions five to ten. Enge spun at Ascari turn but regained control of his car and resumed driving.

==Qualifying==
Saturday afternoon&#x27;s one hour qualifying session saw each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107 per cent of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race. The session was held in dry weather conditions, and rises in air and track temperature gave Michelin-shod teams a speed advantage. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a lap of 1:22.216 set with 13 minutes remaining. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident of taking pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who was 0.312 seconds slower and went off into a gravel trap. Michael Schumacher qualified third and made an error on his third run that prevented him from lapping quicker. This was the first race since the 2000 Austrian Grand Prix that Barrichello qualified ahead of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher in fourth had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer. He had three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth on the soft Bridgestone tyre compound in a balanced, fast and stable car. Coulthard, sixth, felt his car&#x27;s balance was good but felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide on the kerb at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and heavily damaged his car against the outside barrier with four minutes to go. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash stopped qualifying for 15 minutes. The two Sauber drivers were eighth and ninth with Heidfeld ahead of Räikkönen on the soft compound Bridgestone tyres; Heidfeld was happy with his position after losing track time on Friday while Räikkönen complained that he had been blocked by Fisichella who was on an out lap.

De La Rosa rounded out the top ten qualifiers and was happy after Jaguar engineer Humphrey Corbett corrected an understeer fault on De La Rosa&#x27;s car. Button in 11th reported his Benetton was well balanced. Frentzen took 12th and said his qualifying position was more significant than him finishing fourth at the Belgian Grand Prix. Irvine struggled with brake balance which shifted towards the rear of his Jaguar, leaving him 13th. He also was unable to set a faster time after Olivier Panis blocked him by driving to the first corner apex and stopped his car. Fisichella, 14th, drove his Benetton team&#x27;s spare car because his race car developed a hydraulic failure and had an engine issue in the spare car. BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Panis were 15th and 17th; both drivers reported a lack of aerodynamic grip but fine mechanical grip. The two were separated by Alesi in the slower of the two Jordan cars and described his session as &quot;the worst qualifying session I could imagine on a circuit which love&quot; because he had brake balance and handling issues. Verstappen (who adjusted his tyre pressures) and Bernoldi (who had oversteer) were 18th and 19th for the Arrows team as they focused on setting up their cars. Enge took 20th in his first Formula One qualifying session, experiencing two engine problems that Prost traced to a quality control error from engine supplier Ferrari in both the race car and the spare car tuned for Frentzen. The two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field with Alonso ahead of Yoong; both drivers stopped on their out laps at the first chicane with gearbox actuator failures and both drivers returned to the pit lane to share the spare Minardi car.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

The drivers participated in a 30-minute warm-up session for teams to adjust their cars and setups and experiment with different levels of fuel before determining their strategies at 09:30 local time. It took place in sunny and windy weather conditions. Michael Schumacher led with a lap of 1:26.029, ahead of Coulthard, Montoya, Barrichello, Räikkönen, Trulli, Alesi, Ralf Schumacher, Häkkinen and Villeneuve. The first nine drivers set a lap within eight-tenths of a second of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s time, indicating a competitive field. After the end of the warm-up but before the race at 11:15 local time, a second minute of silence was organised by the Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the beginning of the Drivers&#x27; Parade.

==Race==
The race started before around 95,000 to 110,000 spectators at 14:00 local time, running for 53 laps over a distance of . It took place in sunny weather conditions; the air temperature was and the track temperature ; forecasts predicted no rainfall throughout the race. During the race&#x27;s buildup on a flat-bed truck at the pre-race drivers&#x27; parade and on the starting grid, Michael Schumacher attempted to organise a pact with the drivers that would see no overtaking at the first two chicanes. The plan failed, with Villeneuve, Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore and Arrows owner Tom Walkinshaw refusing to accept the pact; Briatore threatened to sack both of his team&#x27;s drivers if they complied with the pact. Schumacher had been keen to avoid any accidents at the start, due to a combination of the effects of the 11 September 2001 attacks earlier that week; the death of fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti in a pile-up at the beginning of the previous year&#x27;s race; a major accident in the previous day&#x27;s CART race in Germany, in which former Formula One driver Alex Zanardi was critically injured, resulting in the amputation of both legs, and multi-car accidents at the beginning of both the Porsche Supercup and International Formula 3000 support races.

Heidfeld lost hydraulic pressure on the grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same because he had a leaking fuel filler in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for third at the exit of Variante della Roggia. He got past on the inside into the Curve di Lesmo after Ralf pushed him onto the grass into the turn. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button, who drove too fast on the slippery outside line going into the chicane, braked too late, and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. As yellow flags were waved, Button made a pit stop at the end of the lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine moved from 13th to seventh by the end of the first lap, as Häkkinen went through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen progressed from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard and De La Rosa.

Barrichello and Michael Schumacher started to maintain the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started to pull away from Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for 11th position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button retired from the race when his engine failed and smoke billowed from his car on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane because he out-braked himself into the turn, which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the entry to the second Lesmo corner on the ninth lap. Barrichello began to pull away from Montoya. Three laps later, Michael Schumacher unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Montoya into the second chicane because Montoya locked his brakes since Montoya overshot his braking point and shortcutted the corner to remain in second. Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth that same lap while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13.

Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong, driving with steering affected by Button&#x27;s front wing hitting his left-front tyre on the first lap, at the back of the field lost control of his car at Curva di Lesmo corner but continued driving; he avoided being hit by Montoya and Michael Schumacher. Michael Schumacher battled for Montoya for third until he became the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 18, and rejoined the track in fourth. The Williams and Ferrari teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Williams team were planning a one-stop strategy whereas the Ferrari team were planning for two stops because Ferrari were concerned over their brakes overheating. Barrichello (on a lighter fuel load) was able to quickly extend his lead over Montoya to ten seconds by his first pit stop on lap 19. However, Barrichello&#x27;s pit stop proved problematic: his refuelling rig failed to work after it had been re-programmed and Ferrari mechanics switched to his teammate&#x27;s refuelling rig, keeping Barrichello stationary for around six to seven seconds longer than planned. Barrichello exited the pit lane in third, ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. 

Häkkinen lost second on lap 19 before retiring at the Rettifilio chicane two laps later after losing all gears. Although he received signals from the pit lane to preserve his brakes, Verstappen retired on the 26th lap with a loss of power. At the front of the field, Ralf Schumacher moved into the race lead when Montoya made his pit stop on lap 28, where his pit crew made an adjustment to his front wing but had excess oversteer at the race&#x27;s conclusion. Montoya rejoined in third behind Barrichello with a deficit of 5.5 seconds. Frentzen drove onto the grass to retire from ninth with a gearbox failure on lap 30. Villeneuve made a pit stop from sixth on lap 34 and retained the position. Ralf Schumacher set a series of quick laps to open up a gap of 6.1 seconds over Barrichello by his one and only pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined in fourth. De La Rosa was the last one-stop driver to pit on lap 36 from fifth, which he maintained upon rejoining the track. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop for fuel on lap 40, and dropped to fourth behind Ralf Schumacher. Montoya returned to the lead when Barrichello made a pit stop for fuel on lap 41. Barrichello rejoined in third, right behind Ralf Schumacher. 

At the completion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the race order was Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, De La Rosa and Villeneuve. Barrichello lapped faster than Ralf Schumacher and he closed up to the latter. He slipstreamed Schumacher on the start/finish straight into the Retfillo chicane at the beginning of lap 47, and braked later than Schumacher at the end of the straight. Schumacher out-braked himself and drove onto the concrete run-off on the inside of the left-hand part of the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position. He allowed Barrichello past on the inside into the Curva Grande for second because Schumacher was aware that the race stewards would impose a stop-and-go penalty on him for cutting the first chicane. Yoong retired from the event on the following lap after spinning his car into the gravel trap at the first Lesmo corner, and yellow flags were waved. Bernoldi became the race&#x27;s final retirement when his car developed a crankshaft sensor problem on the same lap.

Barrichello closed the gap between himself and Montoya but was unable to catch up to the Williams driver who crossed the finish line first on lap 53 to clinch his maiden Formula One victory and the first for a Colombian driver. in a time of 1&#x27;16:58.393 at an average speed of . Barrichello finished in second position 5.175 seconds behind Montoya and Ralf Schumacher followed in third to complete the podium finishers, ahead of Michael Schumacher in fourth position. De La Rosa was anonymous in achieving his second points result of the season and the first points for the Jaguar team since the with a fifth-place finish and Villeneuve&#x27;s BAR car completed the points-scorers in sixth. Räikkönen was the final driver on the lead lap in a close seventh position, and Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Enge and Alonso were the final classified finishers.

===After the race===
Out of respect for those who died in the September 11 attacks, no champagne was sprayed on the podium. In the subsequent press conference, Montoya said he was &quot;so happy&quot; and &quot;pleased&quot; that he achieved his maiden Grand Prix victory. He also said that he was not frustrated on not claiming his first victory in the preceding 14 races as he was not expecting to win during the season. Barrichello said that he felt that Ferrari put on &quot;a good show&quot; despite his slow pit stop from a fuel rig problem on lap 19. He also believed that his two-stop strategy was the right move and described his weekend as &quot;one of my best&quot;. When asked if his car was inconsistent during the Grand Prix, Ralf Schumacher said this was not the case and stated although he had problem with his tyres he felt the Williams finish of first and third was &quot;a great achievement&quot;.

Alesi attacked Briatore&#x27;s role in preventing the drivers from abiding by the pact that was to see no overtaking in the first two chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race. Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he &quot;behaved like a perfect leader&quot;. Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: &quot;We are race car drivers, Because we signed contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars. Because we knew a year ago that there would be a race at Monza and nobody complained.&quot; FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.

Brawn insisted the reason Ferrari opted for a two-stop strategy was to defeat Williams tactically on the high-speed circuit, adding: &quot;We&#x27;d been trounced at Hockenheim, and I didn&#x27;t really see the point in following a couple of ultra-quick BMWs down the straight.&quot; Jean Todt, Ferrari team principal, admitted that the refuelling rig issue at Barrichello&#x27;s first pit stop possibly lost the driver the opportunity to win the race. De La Rosa said that his fifth-position finish gave his Jaguar team better morale, &quot;The past few races haven&#x27;t been very good and I am just delighted for everybody in the team. Everything went like clockwork today. The Jaguar R2 felt very well balanced throughout and I didn&#x27;t suffer from any problems.&quot; Button said that he was sorry to have collided with Trulli on the race&#x27;s opening lap.

The result allowed Michael Schumacher to extend his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 50 points over Coulthard. Barrichello&#x27;s second-place finish allowed him to narrow the gap to Coulthard to be three points behind. Ralf Schumacher remained in fourth position, while Montoya&#x27;s victory promoted him to fifth. Ferrari remained in the lead of the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with an 80-point advantage over McLaren, whose points advantage over Williams had reduced to eight points. Sauber maintained fourth place, while BAR took over fifth position.

<text>The 2001 United States Grand Prix (formally the 2001 SAP United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on September 30, 2001, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. It was the 16th and penultimate round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship, and the second United States Grand Prix hosted at Indianapolis. It was the first international sporting event to take place in the United States since the September 11 attacks, which occurred 19 days before the Grand Prix. McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen won the 73-lap race after starting fourth. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher finished second, while Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard was third.

Michael Schumacher took pole position after setting the fastest qualifying lap, with Häkkinen second. Häkkinen&#x27;s best time, however, was deleted by the stewards after he was penalized for a pit lane infraction during the warm-up session and dropped to fourth on the basis of his second-best qualifying lap. Michael Schumacher led the opening four laps before relinquishing the lead to teammate Rubens Barrichello. Before his first of two pit stops on lap 27, Barrichello had built up a significant lead over his teammate. Häkkinen used his engine&#x27;s low fuel usage to take the lead and keep it until his lone pit stop on the 46th lap, when he dropped to second. Barrichello retook the lead for four laps, and Häkkinen led the rest of the race to claim his second victory of the season and the 20th (and final) of his career after Barrichello was forced to retire two laps from the finish due to an engine failure.

The final result meant that Michael Schumacher broke the all-time record for most points scored in a season, which he shared with Nigel Mansell. Coulthard increased his lead over Barrichello in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by four points in the battle for second. McLaren&#x27;s performance in Indianapolis clinched the team second in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship from Williams with one round remaining in the season.

== Background ==

The 2001 United States Grand Prix was the penultimate round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship, held on September 30, 2001, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) road course in Speedway, Indiana. It was the second United States Grand Prix to take place at Indianapolis, which had previously hosted the Indianapolis 500 as part of the Formula One World Championship from to . The Porsche Supercup and the Ferrari Challenge held support races during the weekend. Bridgestone brought the soft and hard compound tires to the Grand Prix while Michelin supplied the &quot;Prime&quot; and &quot;Option&quot; compounds.

Before the race, both the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and World Constructors&#x27; Championship were already won, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having secured the World Drivers&#x27; Championship three rounds earlier in the and Ferrari took the World Constructors&#x27; Championship at the same race, with McLaren too many points behind to be able to catch them.

Following the on 16 September, the Arrows, Benetton, British American Racing (BAR), Jordan, Jaguar and McLaren teams tested over three days at the Silverstone Circuit in England to prepare for the United States Grand Prix. Wet weather affected all three days, and teams only got the final day to run on a dry track. Jordan&#x27;s Jean Alesi led the first day of testing, while McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz led the remaining two days. The Williams team tested its Michelin tyres, chassis, and engine at the Circuito do Estoril with regular driver Ralf Schumacher, test driver Marc Gené, and Formula 3000 drivers Antônio Pizzonia and Ricardo Sperafico. Sauber developed the C20 car for the American race for four days at the Mugello Circuit in Italy, first with Italian Formula 3000 driver Felipe Massa and then with regular driver Nick Heidfeld. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent five days at the Fiorano Circuit in Italy evaluating the F2001&#x27;s electronics systems, engine mapping, tire evaluations, and components for the F2002 car.

The September 11 attacks occurred 19 days before the race, forcing several teams to be hesitant to send workers to Indianapolis amid security concerns at the circuit. Some drivers and team principals publicly questioned the race&#x27;s viability due to concerns about behavior and personal safety but others believed it had to be held to show support for the United States. The race went on as planned, with additional security measures implemented by local, state, and federal law enforcement to protect spectators and participating teams. It was the United States&#x27;s first major international sporting event since the attacks, and no security incidents occurred. According to IMS president Tony George, he never considered cancelling the race after talking to Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) president Max Mosley and Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone. Several participants paid respect to the victims of the September 11 attacks by putting American flags on their racing helmets and cars. The Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association donated personal racing items to raise funds for the victims.

Eleven constructors entered two drivers each for the event; six of the entered drivers had not driven on the Indianapolis road course before and two were past Indianapolis 500 winners. Michael Schumacher and Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya were the British bookmakers&#x27; joint favourites to win the race. FIA doctor Gary Hartstein ordered Luciano Burti to rest until at least the end of December 2001, and he was replaced for the season&#x27;s final two races by Czech driver Tomáš Enge. Minardi ran into problems with preparation because half of their personnel did not have visas. The issue was later resolved and the team travelled to Indianapolis. Because of the terrorist attacks, Michael Schumacher was given the option to withdraw from the Grand Prix by Ferrari, who had Badoer on standby to replace him if necessary. He ultimately went to the race. Ralf Schumacher, his brother, also competed despite calling Formula One&#x27;s plans to hold the race a &quot;bad joke.&quot;

Some teams modified their cars for the race, with most concentrating on adapting them to the Indianapolis road course. Ferrari and Williams brought technical innovations that they intended to use in the 2002 season. Ferrari introduced a revised steering wheel with four additional buttons, two of which were for adjusting the traction control system. The team also installed a new extractor profile and a rear wing similar to the one used at the . Williams fitted new engine exhausts, similar to those built by Ferrari. It also made two chassis available to their drivers but without new bodywork because some bulky radiators were difficult to mount. Jordan installed new Ferrari-style brake ducts on their EJ11 car for qualifying and Minardi supplied titanium gearboxes to their drivers.

== Practice ==
There were two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday morning before the race on Sunday. Friday&#x27;s two practice sessions were held in cool, overcast weather, with fewer spectators in the grandstands because of the September 11 attacks. The circuit was relatively dirty, so most of the first practice session was spent cleaning it and laying tire rubber on it. The lack of grip on the dusty surface meant several drivers lost control of their cars but no one crashed. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1:14.085 late in the session. He was followed by McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard, Rubens Barrichello (Ferrari), Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella, Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen and his teammate Heidfeld, as well as Jordan&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Benetton&#x27;s Jenson Button and Arrows&#x27;s Jos Verstappen. Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s McLaren was on the jacks due to a pneumatic valve gear failure, requiring the mechanics to change the engine in 45 minutes to resolve the issue; this restricted him to four laps and was 14th-fastest.

Drivers continued to tweak their setups around the circuit during the second practice session. Häkkinen set the day&#x27;s fastest time, a 1:13:387, with twelve minutes remaining. Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, Heidfeld, Prost&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Irvine&#x27;s teammate Pedro de la Rosa and the Williams duo of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya were in positions two through ten. Fisichella&#x27;s session was cut short after five minutes after his Benetton car went into the gravel at turn four. Enge spun through 180 degrees at the exit of turn eight due to oversteer. Just as Enge was able to turn his car in the right way, two Jaguars narrowly missed hitting the rear of his car, causing him to stall and necessitating the assistance of marshals. An electrical fault caused Verstappen to stop his car at the pit lane entry with two minutes left.

During Saturday&#x27;s practice sessions, which were held in dry and sunny conditions, Ferrari were the only team to test rear brake lights, although no concrete conclusions were drawn from their use. Michael Schumacher set the quickest lap at 1:12.078 a third of the way through the third practice session. His brother Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Häkkinen, Coulthard, Button, Heidfeld, Fisichella and Trulli followed in positions two to ten. Montoya lost control of his car&#x27;s rear while braking due to oversteer and spun through 180 degrees at turn six, although he continued driving without damage. Trulli spun between turns nine and ten before Bernoldi spun backwards onto the turn eight escape road and stalled the engine.

Due to an oil pump failure caused by a loss in oil pressure, Michael Schumacher abandoned his Ferrari on the grass beside the pit lane exit in the final practice session. This necessitated an engine change for qualifying but he remained fastest overall. Häkkinen was faster and moved to second place. Heidfeld, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Montoya, Fisichella, Coulthard, Button, and Räikkönen completed the top ten. Häkkinen skidded into the gravel trap between turns three and four before rejoining the track, and Alex Yoong spun twice in his Minardi midway through the race but continued without stalling.

== Qualifying ==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting positions determined by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, forcing each driver to stay within 107% of the quickest lap time in order to qualify for the race. The session was held in clear weather. Michael Schumacher was unaffected by slower cars, securing his tenth pole position of the season in 16 races and 42nd of his career with a time of 1:11.708 set on his third quick lap with nine minutes remaining. He made no further runs, telling Ferrari that he had exhausted his car&#x27;s capability. He was provisionally joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Häkkinen, who challenged Schumacher for pole until the latter set the pole-deciding lap. Häkkinen made no attempt to lap quicker after setting his fastest time since he knew he could not go faster. Ralf Schumacher took third after a braking error into turn four stopped him from lapping faster. His teammate Montoya, fourth, had handling issues, slower cars on his third run, and made a driver error on his final run. Barrichello was fifth after failing to slipstream teammate Michael Schumacher on his second run when he encountered Trulli. Heidfeld equalled his best qualifying result of the season, taking sixth. He felt he could have gone faster if he had not had to lose two-tenths of a second by braking early on his fastest lap due to an accident involving Enge. Coulthard in seventh had a car setup that failed to eliminate oversteer on a light fuel load. Jordan teammates Alesi (in his 200th Grand Prix start) and Trulli were eighth and ninth, respectively, due to poor infield performance due to a lower downforce configuration for higher top speed on the main straight; Trulli aborted his final run due to the presence of slower cars. Button improved his car during qualifying and took tenth, his first top ten start of the season.

Räikkönen, 11th, was the fastest non-top-ten qualifier, unable to establish the optimal chassis balance after small setup changes proved ineffective and had handling issues. Fisichella finished 12th after encountering yellow flags for Enge&#x27;s crash, forcing him to slow down during his final run. Part of his engine cover detached on the main straight. BAR&#x27;s Olivier Panis lacked grip and began from 13th. Irvine, 14th, experienced understeer and significant front-end vibration after a setup adjustment for his fourth run, in which he lost time on the banking. Frentzen in 15th reported that his team adjusted the balance of his car. De La Rosa was 16th after encountering traffic on his final run and failing to generate heat in his tyres. Minardi&#x27;s Fernando Alonso secured 17th on his final attempt after suspecting an engine problem in his race chassis on his third run and switching to the team&#x27;s spare car with an older gearbox. Panis&#x27;s teammate Jacques Villeneuve in 18th drove a car lacking grip after an incorrect chassis setup and tried the spare BAR vehicle. The Arrows duo of Enrique Bernoldi and Verstappen qualified 19th and 20th; Bernoldi&#x27;s engine developed a chronic misfire and entered the garage to switch to the team&#x27;s spare car for the rest of the session. Verstappen made a minor error on his first run and was delayed by Montoya at turn three on his last run. Enge, 21st, experienced a right-front brake failure on his final quick lap and collided head-on with the left-hand turn eight tire barrier at the end of the back straight. He was unhurt, and his car was repaired in time for the warm-up session. Yoong completed the starting grid in 22nd after lapping faster on each of his runs despite car balance problems. Tire advancements meant 21 of the 22 qualifiers were faster than the 2000 pole lap.

===Qualifying classification===
Notes

* – Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s fastest qualifying lap time of 1:11.945 was deleted for ignoring a red light during the warm-up session. This demoted him from second to fourth on the grid.

== Warm-up ==
A half hour warm-up session was held on September 30 at 08:30 Eastern Standard Time (UTC−05:00). It took place in sunny and bright weather, with temperatures steadily dropping. Drivers were slower than in qualifying due to the reduced track temperature. Ralf Schumacher set the fastest overall time of 1:13.912, followed by McLaren&#x27;s Coulthard and Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher and Verstappen. Some drivers lost control of their cars during warm-up, with Coulthard damaging his undertray mounting the turn five high kerb. Montoya&#x27;s engine failed in the spare Williams car setup for him eight minutes into the session, dropping oil and metal debris on the track between the banked turn 13 and the main straight. Race officials stopped the session for 15 minutes to allow marshals to clean the circuit. Häkkinen damaged the spare McLaren&#x27;s right-hand side against the turn eight metal barrier shortly before warm-up ended. He was unhurt.

An hour before the race began, the stewards deleted Häkkinen&#x27;s fastest qualifying lap for not noticing the red light situated on the left-hand side at the pit lane exit and overtaking cars stopped in a line waiting for the session to restart following Montoya&#x27;s engine failure. His final grid position of fourth was determined by his second-fastest qualifying lap of 1:12.309. This promoted Williams teammates Ralf Schumacher and Montoya to second and third, respectively. McLaren did not appeal the penalty; the penalty angered Häkkinen, saying he believed it was unfair because his vision was impaired by the low sun&#x27;s glare.

== Race ==
The 73-lap. race, began at 13:00 local time, an hour earlier than other Grands Prix to accommodate European television viewers. The weather on the grid were dry and sunny before the race; the air temperature was between and the track temperature from . The pre-race ceremony, named &quot;United We Stand&quot; to commemorate &quot;the international community as well as the United States and its heroes&quot; was hosted by women&#x27;s soccer player Brandi Chastain. Recording artist Patti LaBelle opened the ceremony by singing &quot;God Bless America&quot;. Singer and Indiana native John Mellencamp performed his single &quot;Peaceful World&quot; from his album &quot;Cuttin&#x27; Heads&quot; and then the American Cabaret Theatre sung a patriotic melody. IMS pastor Mike Welch from the St. Christopher&#x27;s Catholic Church delivered a sermon before the Indianapolis Children&#x27;s Choir performed the American National Anthem.

Approximately between 175,000 and 200,000 spectators attended the race, with 1,000 free tickets given to off-duty police officers. Most spectators were from the United States, as most Europeans did not attend the event due to worries over possible airline cancellations following the September 11 attacks. Ferrari ran the harder Bridgestone tire compound while McLaren chose the softer option. When the race began, Montoya overtook teammate Ralf Schumacher off the line on the side of the track that offered him more grip and slipstreamed Michael Schumacher, who prevented him from trying a pass on the outside by driving across him to lead into the first corner. Behind them, Barrichello moved from fifth to third. Enge was stationary on the grid due to a clutch issue and had to start manually to get away from his starting spot, losing him ten seconds. Entering turn eight, Bernoldi avoided colliding with De La Rosa&#x27;s Jaguar. At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led Montoya by eight-tenths of a second, followed by Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Häkkinen and Coulthard.

The Sauber duo of Heidfeld and Räikkönen, as well as Trulli, went three-wide on the drive into turn one at the start of the second lap. Räikkönen was blocked off by Trulli&#x27;s pincer manoeuvre (when attempting to pass him on the outside) and damaged his front wing against his teammate&#x27;s rear-left wheel. When the lap ended, Räikkönen made an unscheduled pit stop to replace the front wing, but he retired on lap three after his left-rear driveshaft broking from colliding with Trulli. Heidfeld and Trulli&#x27;s cars were undamaged. Barrichello was lapping faster than Montoya due to his smaller fuel load as a result of his two-stop strategy, and slipstreamed past him on the outside at the first turn for second to begin lap three. Both Ferraris began to distance themselves from Montoya, who showed signs of tire trouble, delaying his teammate Ralf Schumacher on a lesser fuel load and allowing Häkkinen and Coulthard to stay in contention. This came just as Barrichello began gaining on his teammate Michael Schumacher.

Further back, Button overtook Trulli for eighth while Irvine was passed by Alesi for eleventh. On lap five, Michael Schumacher realized that Barrichello was faster than him because of the latter&#x27;s two-stop strategy and slowed slightly, letting his teammate by on the inside approaching turn eight at the end of the back straight and into the lead. Barrichello&#x27;s string of fastest laps allowed him to draw away from the rest of the field and lead by 5.2 seconds on the tenth lap. Heideld attempted to pass Coulthard on the inside into turn one on lap nine. Despite failing to complete the manoevure, Heidfeld battled Coulthard for the next eight laps. Between the 13th and 14th laps, Alesi overtook Benetton teammates Button and Fisichella after braking on the inside into turn one, as the Benetton cars were difficult to drive due to rear tire wear. As the ambient temperature rose, the field became more dispersed by lap 19. As the tires degraded and cars became lighter when their fuel loads reduced, Montoya and Ralf Schumacher gained on Michael Schumacher by setting personal fastest laps from around lap 20. Because the wear and balance on the Williams cars remained consistent, Montoya&#x27;s performance on the Michelin tires improved with time.

Ralf Schumacher was the first of the leading drivers to enter the pit lane at the end of lap 23 for the first of two scheduled pit stops. He stopped for 12.5 seconds due to Williams mechanics struggling to replace the left-rear wheel because of a faulty wheel gun. Ralf Schumacher rejoined the track in ninth place. Barrichello led by 12.5 seconds when he made the first of two scheduled pit stops on lap 27. He rejoined the race in fifth behind Coulthard after a 8.6 second stop. Michael Schumacher led the next seven laps under pressure from Montoya, who had tried to slow him to allow Barrichello to make his pit stop. Montoya fell behind Michael Schumacher on lap 32 after losing control of his car in the infield section. As they came up to lap Yoong, Montoya slipstreamed past Michael Schumacher on the inside at the end of the main straight into turn one with his front tires locked through braking later than the latter for the lead on the 34th lap, with Schumacher giving Montoya enough space to avoid a crash. Montoya began pulling away from Michael Schumacher, setting the race&#x27;s fastest lap and a new lap record of 1:14.448 on lap 35. He made his only scheduled pit stop for fuel and tires when lap 36 concluded because Williams were unable to take advantage of the full capacity of the car&#x27;s large fuel tank at Indianapolis since it would have worn out the rear Michelin tyres if they put a large amount of fuel in. Montoya fell to fifth, behind Coulthard, and Michael Schumacher retook the lead.

On lap 37, Ralf Schumacher lost control of his car after locking the brakes into turn six, and his race finished in the gravel. Alonso entered the pit lane for a planned pit stop but was unable to continue due to a driveshaft failure a lap later. Michael Schumacher made his only stop on lap 39 and Häkkinen took the lead. He returned to the circuit in fourth. On the same lap, smoke billowed from the rear of Montoya&#x27;s car going through the banked turn 13 due to faulty hydraulics, stopping after crossing the start-finish line. Double waved yellow flags came out as marshals moved Montoya&#x27;s car from the circuit to avoid the deployment of the safety car. The yet-to-stop McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard continued to hold first and second through the low fuel consumption of their Mercedes engines and lapping quickly enough to exploit the situation but they encountered De la Rosa, Villeneuve and Alesi&#x27;s slower cars. At this point, most drivers had yet to make another pit stop. Häkkinen had waited until the circuit was to his liking and was less hampered by traffic than teammate Coulthard, prompting the latter to make a 9.5-second pit stop on lap 43. Coulthard fell to fourth, behind Michael Schumacher.

Yoong retired his car with gearbox issues on the 44th lap. Häkkinen lapped faster than Barrichello since his car had less fuel, and he made his only pit stop from the lead when lap 45 concluded. His pit stop lasted 9.6 seconds and his pit crew&#x27;s efficiency meant he rejoined in second, ahead of Michael Schumacher. De La Rosa and Villeneuve collided at the end of the back straight in turn eight on lap 46 as the former attempted to overtake the latter on the inside. Both drivers kept their engines running and continued. Villeneuve made a pit stop for a cursory examination of his car on the following lap but retired in the garage one lap later with left-front suspension damage. Verstappen retired on lap 47 due to a minor airbox bay fire. After Häkkinen&#x27;s pit stop, Barrichello retook the lead and had to lead by half a minute to stay ahead of the Finn, having lost two or three seconds in his first two stints. His final pit stop came on lap 50, when he was over 22 seconds ahead of Häkkinen. The stop lasted 8.2 seconds and Barrichello fell to second, behind Häkkinen.

Irvine was the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 52, as part of Jaguar&#x27;s strategy of going as far as possible without stopping. He fell from fifth to seventh. Irvine&#x27;s tires were almost worn down to the canvas at this time, and the FIA officials took notice. On lap 56, Heidfeld lost sixth to Irvine at turn 11, who held off Heidfeld. Initially, it appeared that Barrichello would be unable to gain on Häkkinen, but he later lapped faster than the latter. Barrichello was 2.2 seconds behind Häkkinen on lap 61, when blue smoke began emanating from the rear of his Ferrari which gradually became larger but no oil was laid on the track. His engine began sounding rough on the front straight and he slowed considerably. Barrichello let Michael Schumacher through into second on the main straight on lap 70 and defended from Coulthard until he overtook him into the banked turn 13 for third on the next lap. On lap 72, Barrichello attempted to nurse his car to the finish by short-shifting to preserve the engine, and score some championship points to keep him in contention for second in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship but his engine seized on the back straight due to the loss of oil, locking his tires. He abandoned his Ferrari on the inside of the circuit before turn eight after spinning 90 degrees. This promoted Trulli to fourth, Irvine to fifth and Heidfeld to sixth.

Häkkinen kept the lead he had held for 23 laps and won his second race of the season and 20th (and final) victory of his career before going on a sabbatical from the 2002 season. Michael Schumacher finished second, 11 seconds behind, and held off the closing Coulthard in third. Trulli was provisionally fourth, Irvine fifth, and Heidfeld, after losing three gears, completed the points scorers in sixth place. Alesi lapped similarly to his teammate and finished seventh, ahead of the Benetton duo of Fisichella (who nursed a blistered rear tire) and Button in eighth and ninth, respectively. Frentzen, Panis and De La Rosa took the next three places. Bernoldi finished 13th in the spare Arrows car after hitting a piece of bodywork from De La Rosa&#x27;s Jaguar that had detached on the front straight and became lodged in his radiator, causing his car to overheat. Enge and Barrichello (despite retiring) were the final classified finishers.

==Post-race==
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen characterized the win &quot;one of the highlights of the season for me&quot; and &quot;one of my most important victories&quot;, saying it had been his objective to win the and the United States Grand Prix in 2001. He said that he did not overthink victory while running fifth early in the race, instead focusing on his lap times and consistency. Michael Schumacher called his race &quot;pretty straightforward&quot; and added that he was struggling to cope with slower traffic prior to his first pit stop. He admitted that he was fortunate to finish second following Montoya&#x27;s retirement. Coulthard stated that he benefited from events such as driver retirements, but acknowledged that he was fortunate to finish third as a result of that element, adding, &quot;you have to take the results as they come.&quot;

Barrichello voiced his disappointment at retiring the Grand Prix two laps early, saying: &quot;The feeling is horrible. It&#x27;s very difficult to express what I&#x27;m feeling right now. I have shown that whenever I have the chance to win, I&#x27;m going for it.&quot; Montoya was philosophical, stating he could have won his second race in a row if his car had not suffered from hydraulic troubles, &quot;I wanted to really go for the win here and it&#x27;s a big disappointment we couldn&#x27;t finish the race. My second F-1 win and two back-to-back here would have been brilliant.&quot; Trulii expressed satisfaction with finishing fourth and said that he set up his car to accommodate for the laying of tire rubber onto the track surface during the race. Irvine set his objective to pass Benetton for seventh in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship at the following after coming fifth. Villeneuve and De La Rosa blamed each other for their collision on lap 46.

Several hours after the race, the thickness surrounding the rear hole of the wooden skid block (plank) fastened to the underside of Trulli&#x27;s car was found to be greater than the minimum allowed by the regulations, possibly caused by the loosening of two fasteners designed to prevent such wear. As a result, the race stewards disqualified Trulli and promoted Irvine to fourth, Heidfeld to fifth, and Alesi to sixth. Team principal Eddie Jordan wrote in his 2007 autobiography &quot;An Independent Man&quot; that he received an anonymous telephone call suggesting the team should forensically review the three signatures on the FIA bulletin because a steward whose signature was on that bulletin was absent from the meeting with team manager Trevor Foster since he had left Indianapolis. Jordan appealed the decision through the Royal Irish Automobile Club, claiming that the rear fasteners broke loose during the race and caused the excessive wear. Three judges from the FIA International Court of Appeal met in Paris to hear the appeal on October 26. The FIA general secretary ruled that Trulli&#x27;s disqualification should be reversed due to &quot;a breach of the right of defence&quot; since a steward was absent at the initial post-race hearing, a violation of the International Sporting Code. As a result, the stewards&#x27; decision was overturned, and Trulli returned to fourth.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s second-place final increased his points tally to 113, breaking the record he shared with Nigel Mansell for the most points scored in a single season by five points. Coulthard was now seven points ahead of Barrichello in the battle for second while Ralf Schumacher in fourth was another six points behind. Ferrari continued to lead the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 167 points. McLaren&#x27;s performance in Indianapolis secured them second place from Williams in the standings with one round remaining in the season.

<text>The 2001 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the 2001 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held before 150,000 spectators on 14 October 2001, at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Mie, Japan. It was the 17th and final round of the 2001 Formula One World Championship. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 53-lap race from pole position. Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya finished in second and McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard was third.

World Drivers&#x27; Champion Michael Schumacher qualified on pole position by setting the fastest lap time in the one-hour qualifying session. Montoya started from second, alongside Schumacher. The Ferrari driver held off Montoya&#x27;s attack to take the lead on the first lap, losing it only during the race leaders&#x27; two pit stops. Schumacher won the race, with Montoya 3.1 seconds behind. Coulthard finished third, having been let past by McLaren teammate Mika Häkkinen in the final five laps of the Grand Prix.

Schumacher&#x27;s victory was his ninth of the season, tying his own record from and and Nigel Mansell from . As a consequence of the race, Schumacher finished the year with a season-record 123 points scored in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, breaking Alain Prost&#x27;s all-time record for most career points scored. Coulthard finished the season as the runner-up, 56 points behind Schumacher. Ferrari finished 77 points ahead of McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship.

== Background ==
The 2001 Japanese Grand Prix was the 17th and final Formula One race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship, held on 14 October 2001, at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Mie, Japan. Some news websites incorrectly reported that the event would be postponed due to the United States invasion of Afghanistan after the previous month&#x27;s September 11 attacks in the United States but the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) issued a statement refuting the reports.

Before the race, both the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and World Constructors&#x27; Championship were already won, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having secured the World Drivers&#x27; Championship four races earlier in the and Ferrari took the World Constructors&#x27; Championship at the same event, with McLaren too many points behind to be able to catch them. In the battle for the runner-up spot, McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard led Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello by seven points. To gain second place in the championship, Barrichello had to win the Grand Prix and Coulthard finish fifth or below. Sauber were battling Jordan for fourth position in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship and were five points ahead, but an appeal against Jarno Trulli&#x27;s disqualification from the preceding would have reduced their advantage by two points if successful.

Following the United States Grand Prix on 30 September, between 2 October and 6, most teams evaluated car components, aerodynamic packages, racing setups and tyres at various European racing circuits at several European racetracks in preparation for the Japanese Grand Prix. British American Racing (BAR), Sauber and Jordan each tested for three days at Italy&#x27;s Mugello Circuit, while Benetton, Jaguar, McLaren and Williams were at Spain&#x27;s Circuit de Catalunya for three days. Ferrari spent six days at the Italian Fiorano Circuit with test driver Luca Badoer and Michael Schumacher. The Arrows, Minardi and Prost teams did not test at the period, instead focussing on the development of their cars.

The press speculated whether Michael Schumacher would help his teammate Barrichello become the championship runner-up in Japan. Michael Schumacher commented he was &quot;only interested in winning&quot; but added there was a small possibility Ferrari could help Barrichello finish second. Barrichello had been asked twice to aid Michael Schumacher this season and wanted to secure second in the standings without his teammate&#x27;s assistance, saying, &quot;After the team won the championship with Michael it has been proved that with a little bit of help and a little bit more attention I can do the job. But at the end of the day I have to win the race and David has to finish fifth or lower, so it&#x27;s a hard task.&quot; Coulthard stated that he came to Japan to win the Grand Prix and finish second in the championship.

There were eleven two-driver teams, each representing a different constructor, with no changes to the entry list from the previous race. This was the final Grand Prix for Jordan&#x27;s Jean Alesi and McLaren&#x27;s two-time World Champion Mika Häkkinen. It was also the last Grand Prix for the Prost squad, who went bankrupt and closed down the following off-season, and for the Benetton team as it was renamed as Renault in deference to the team&#x27;s French owners for 2002. Several teams used experimental solutions to Japan to guide the development of their 2002 vehicles. Ferrari brought a lighter, more rigid F2001 chassis while McLaren introduced no particular innovations and Williams used a top-exit exhaust featured at the United States Grand Prix on both their racing cars. Honda supplied BAR and Jordan with a new V10 engine specification while Cosworth did the same for Jaguar. Renault provided Benetton with a new qualifying engine for the team&#x27;s final race. Arrows installed the aerodynamic package used at the on their A22 cars and Minardi installed new titanium gearboxes in both cars.

== Practice ==

A total of four practice sessions preceded Sunday&#x27;s race, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The first practice session took place on Friday morning in sunny weather. Michael Schumacher posted the quickest lap time of 1:37.443 44 minutes in, 0.355 seconds ahead of Häkkinen. They were ahead of Williams&#x27;s Juan Pablo Montoya, Barrichello, Alesi, Coulthard, Montoya&#x27;s teammate Ralf Schumacher, Prost&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Jaguar&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa and Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld. Some drivers went off the track during the session. With one minute left, Tomáš Enge lost control of his Prost car at an apex, going off the racing line and oversteering across the gravel trap at 130R corner. He struck the tyre barrier at high speed, removing his two right-hand side wheels. Enge complained of neck pain, but exited the car unaided as practice was red-flagged. He did not participate in the second practice session.

The weather remained sunny for the afternoon&#x27;s second session. On a light fuel load, Alesi set the day&#x27;s fastest lap time of 1:35.454, 0.523 seconds faster than the second-placed Montoya. De La Rosa, Häkkinen, Frentzen, Jaguar&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello followed in the top ten. Halfway through the session, Heidfeld was on his first quick lap on a new set of soft Bridgestone tyres when he lost control of his vehicle&#x27;s front into the final right-hand corner in the S-Curve section and spun backwards into the inside tyre barrier at . His car stopped in the circuit&#x27;s centre, and he suffered a minor headache and debris was littered across the track. Heidfeld was transported to the medical centre, and practice was stopped for ten minutes. Late in the session, Coulthard spun into the turn two gravel trap; his right-front brake assembly caught fire in the pit lane when a stretch of trap tape that had not been entirely ripped from a duct became entangled in the brake cooling duct and was ignited by the brake&#x27;s heat.

The third practice session was held on Saturday morning in sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher was the first driver to lap under 1:35 all weekend, and he was also the fastest, lapping at 1:34.711 with eight minutes left. He was 0.332 seconds faster than Häkkinen, who was followed by Barrichello, Coulthard, the Williams combination of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya, Sauber&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen, Trulli, Benetton&#x27;s Jenson Button and Frentzen in third to tenth. With three minutes left in the final session, Ralf Schumacher set the first sub-1:34 lap in Suzuka history, at 1:33.969. He outpaced teammate Montoya, Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Button, Trulli, Heidfeld, Häkkinen, Barrichello, and BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve in the next nine positions.

== Qualifying ==
During Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting positions determined by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. The 107% rule was in force during this session, forcing each driver to stay within 107% of the quickest lap time in order to qualify for the race. Michael Schumacher improved his lap time in three of his four runs, and clinched his 11th pole position of the season and the 43rd of his career with a time of 1:32.484 on a new set of tyres. He broke Gerhard Berger&#x27;s all-time lap record on the circuit, set in 1991. Montoya had a minor car balance issue on a low fuel load than Michael Schumacher, although he was faster in the track&#x27;s faster sectors. He was seven-tenths of a second behind in second, having been unable to improve on his final run. Ralf Schumacher was 0.111 seconds slower than his teammate in third, but he was pleased that no one was blocking him to the end of qualifying. Barrichello was unable to eliminate the understeer in his Ferrari, preventing him from lapping faster, and qualified fourth. Häkkinen, fifth, had his car&#x27;s ride height and tyre pressures adjusted but his understeer persisted. Giancarlo Fisichella took ninth after Renault&#x27;s new engine was fitted in his Benetton car. Coulthard qualified in seventh. Trulli, eighth, was hampered somewhat by slower cars in the second sector during his quickest lap. Button achieved his best qualifying result of the season in ninth, citing excess oversteer on his team&#x27;s setup. Heidfeld took 10th, having encountered slower cars on his final run and lost downforce.

Alesi finished 11th in his final Formula One qualifying session, despite working with race engineer David Brown to unsuccessfully narrow the gap on teammate Trulli. Räikkönen learnt his car was overweight anda an understeer on his last run slowed him through the Esses, leaving him in 12th. Irvine trailed his teammate De La Rosa by half a second in engine power but qualified ahead of him in 13th. Villenueve, 14th, was pleased with his car&#x27;s balance and made setup tweaks that did not produce the predicted results. Frentzen&#x27;s first run placed him 15th, and he was unable to lap quicker due to understeer on the soft Michelin tyres. De La Rosa took 16th, with his best lap coming on his third attempt, after failing to find a suitable balance for his car&#x27;s tyres. BAR&#x27;s Olivier Panis reported that his car felt slightly better en route to 17th. Fernando Alonso extracted additional performance from his Minardi car and improved on each lap to qualify 18th. Enge drove the spare Prost AP04 car following his accident the day before, setting his fastest lap on his first run before being stopped by modifications and finishing 19th. The Arrows duo of Enrique Bernoldi and Jos Verstappen qualified 20th and 21st, respectively. Bernoldi had slower cars on his fastest lap, but Verstappen drove a car lacking in pace but had decent handling. Minardi&#x27;s Alex Yoong completed the starting order in 22nd, expressing disappointment over not improving greatly on each of his runs and traffic possibly stopping him from lapping faster during his third run.

===Qualifying classification===
== Warm-up ==
On race morning, teams had a half-hour warm-up session to fine-tune their cars for the event in sunny weather. Michael Schumacher was the fastest driver in the session, with a lap time of 1:36.231. Coulthard was 0.454 seconds slower in second position. Heidfeld set a lap late on to go third-fastest. Trulli, Alesi, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Frentzen, Räikkönen and De La Rosa in the highest-placed Michelin-shod car occupied positions four to ten. During the session, no incidents occurred, and some drivers drove their team&#x27;s spare cars, with the majority of Michelin-shod cars having their tyres scrubbed.

== Race ==
The race began at 14:30 local time and drew 150,000 spectators. The weather was fine and dry, with the air temperature and the track temperature was between . Yoong started from the pit lane in Alonso&#x27;s spare Minardi car when his crew identified an electrical problem with his race car&#x27;s gearbox. Bernoldi stalled on the dummy grid and could not restart his car, thus he was pushed into a gap into the pit lane, where he began. When the red lights went out to signal the start of the race, Michael Schumacher veered to the right to the inside line, blocking the fast-starting Montoya, to keep the race lead into the opening corner. Ralf Schumacher briefly challenged his teammate but remained in third position. Fisichella made a fast start due to his car&#x27;s powerful launch control system, passing Häkkinen for fifth. Barrichello had a small fuel load since Ferrari had put him on a three-stop strategy to try to move to the front of the field. He overtook Ralf Schumacher on the inside for third into the left-hand 130R turn.

Michael Schumacher had a 3.6-second lead over Montoya after the first lap. The two drivers were in turn followed by Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella and Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher began to pull away from the rest of the field, because he was on a new set of tyres and not affected by aerodynamic turbulence, whilst Montoya began the race on a set of scrubbed tyres that required longer to operate in comparison to the Bridgestones. On lap two, Barrichello overtook Montoya on the inside on the approach to the chicane for second place, avoiding contact with the Williams driver by placing two wheels off the circuit. However, Montoya had greater speed coming out of the chicane on the following lap, allowing him to slipstream by Barrichello and retake second at the end of the start-finish straight into the first corner. During the same lap, Fisichella lost control of his car leaving the Denger Curve corner, spinning 180 degrees. He was able to continue driving, but dropped from fifth to 12th. Frentzen had an unplanned pit stop on lap four to replace a dislodged nose cone after swerving to avoid colliding with De La Rosa at the chicane to finish lap two. Panis overtook Alonso for 17th on the same lap.

On lap six, Räikkönen, in ninth, suffered a left-rear suspension failure due to a bump at the exit of the Dunlop Curve. His car immediately went into a high-speed spin. Alesi was battling Räikkönen for position and steered to the outside. However, he collided with the right-rear of the Sauber car at as they slid off to the outside of the track. Both men struck the barriers, littering debris and wheels on the track and one avoided hitting another driver. Räikkönen&#x27;s nose cone grazed Alesi&#x27;s helmet. Approaching cars had to take evasive measures to avoid the detached wheels, but officials did not use the safety car to close the field after determining that debris had not encroached onto the track. Räikkönen complained of head and neck pains and was transported to the medical centre. Meanwhile, Fisichella passed Irvine for ninth as they passed through the accident scene. Michael Schumacher slid on the grass on lap nine after missing his braking point for the final chicane. He was able to remain the race leader. Montoya began to stabilise the deficit on Michael Schumacher from lap ten, as his Michelin tyres appeared to perform better as they wore down.

Fisichella overtook his teammate Button for eighth on lap 12. Barrichello was unable to pass Montoya, thus the plan for Michael Schumacher&#x27;s to allow him past was abandoned. On lap 16, he entered the pit lane for the first of three scheduled stops. Barrichello&#x27;s stop lasted 7.2 seconds and fell from third to eighth, just behind the duel between Trulli and Fisichella. He passed Fisichella for seventh at the chicane as both Fisichella and Trulli entered the pit lane on lap 17. Michael Schumacher entered the pit lane after the next lap ended to make the first of two scheduled pit stops. The stop lasted 8.8 seconds and he rejoined the circuit in fourth, behind Häkkinen. Montoya took the race lead and held it for three laps before making his first pit stop on lap 21, dropping him to fifth, ahead of Barrichello but behind Coulthard. This put his teammate Ralf Schumacher in front until his own pit stop two laps later. Häkkinen took the lead on lap 24, but his pit stop returned Michael Schumacher to the lead. He had held off Michael Schumacher for the previous five laps, during which Schumacher was unable to use his new tyres correctly, losing more than a second per lap. 

Irvine retired in the pit lane on lap 25 when the two Intertechnique fuel rig power sources failed, preventing Jaguar from inserting fuel into his car. During a battle with Barrichello, the FIA stewards placed Ralf Schumacher under investigation for repeatedly cutting the final chicane and gaining an advantage; the stewards had previously notified the Williams team of the infringement by email. He was assessed a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 28, serving it two laps later. At the same time, Barrichello made his second pit stop. As both drivers exited the pit lane, Barrichello&#x27;s engine either died or his pit lane speed limiter activated, taking Ralf Schumacher by surprise and passing him. Ralf Schumacher crossed to the right over the white line separating the pit lane from the race circuit. The FIA stewards decided not to penalise Ralf Schumacher, deeming him to have not anticipated Barrichello going slowly.

On lap 32, Barrichello overtook Ralf Schumacher for fifth place on the inside into the last chicane. Ralf Schumacher cut the chicane for the third time to stay ahead of Barrichello and avoid a collision, retaking the position. Barrichello managed to slipstream by Ralf Schumacher on the inside at the end of the start-finish straight. Ralf Schumacher was not penalised for cutting the chicane on that occasion. Michael Schumacher became the first of the leading drivers to make a second pit stop on lap 36. The stop lasted nine seconds and fell to third, behind Häkkinen. This returned Montoya to the race lead, but he was hampered by slower vehicles, preventing him from extracting the necessary pace to keep the lead. Both he and Häkkinen entered the pit lane for their second pit stops on lap 38. Michael Schumacher thus returned to first place, as Coulthard made his final pit stop on the 40th lap. Barrichello was the final front runner to enter the pit lane for a second pit stop two laps later. He rejoined in fifth, ahead of Ralf Schumacher but behind Coulthard.

After all of the leading drivers had completed their second pit stops, Michael Schumacher led Montoya, Häkkinen, Coulthard, Barrichello, and Ralf Schumacher. Enge retired from the race in the Prost garage with a brake issue on lap 46. Another retirement occurred when De La Rosa parked his car, which lacked downforce and had an oil leak, after 45 laps. Fisichella was in seventh when he lost fourth gear and slowed on track on lap 48. He entered the pit lane, marking the Grand Prix&#x27;s final retirement. That promoted Fisichella&#x27;s teammate Button into seventh. On lap 49, while on the start-finish straight, Häkkinen pulled over and let his teammate Coulthard past into third position. Häkkinen wanted to repay Coulthard for assisting him to win the 1997 European Grand Prix and the 1998 Australian Grand Prix. On lap 50, Villeneuve lost ninth to Heidfeld after losing control of his car at the final chicane.

Montoya pushed hard and closed on Michael Schumacher, but the former held on for the rest of the race to win his ninth race of the season and 53rd overall. He equalled his own record of the most wins in a single season in with Benetton, with Ferrari and Nigel Mansell with Williams in . Montoya came in second, 3.1 seconds behind, while Coulthard finished third. Häkkinen was fourth, with Barrichello fifth and Ralf Schumacher completing the points-paying positions in sixth. Button took seventh with Trulli eighth. Heidfeld took ninth after losing downforce and Villeneuve was tenth. Alonso finished 11th because cars ahead of him retired. Frentzen was 12th with Panis 13th after chassis adjustments slowed him. Bernoldi and Verstappen of Arrows finished 14th and 15th, respectively, after serving ten-second stop-and-go penalties and experiencing power steering failures. Yoong took 16th, registering his first Formula One finish; He was in pain since his seat position had given him a back cramp. Despite retiring, Fisichella was the final classified finisher.

=== Post-race ===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media at the press conference held afterwards. Michael Schumacher agreed that winning the Grand Prix was the conclusion &quot;to the perfect Formula One season&quot;, adding, &quot;Obviously, we&#x27;ve had maybe two races which have been a little bit difficult for us, Monza and Indianapolis, now we&#x27;re back to normality and that&#x27;s a great end and a great result for the championship we have achieved, to finish off the season for the team, for everyone.&quot; Montoya thought it was &quot;a good race&quot; to its conclusion and commented on the Michelin tyres, &quot;The car was good, but while the tyres come in, we lose so much time, as we saw with Michael. When he was on new tyres and I was on scrubbed tyres, while the tyres take five or six laps to come in, there&#x27;s just no competition.&quot; Coulthard said that finishing second in the championship was the best possible result for him, adding, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to finish the season, as Michael said, on the podium. To win would have been fantastic but I&#x27;ve never been that good around Suzuka, so it isn&#x27;t a bad result.&quot;

Alesi&#x27;s crash with Räikkönen on lap six prevented him from being the first driver since Richie Ginther in to finish every race of the season. He commented that he was &quot;so relieved that I did not hurt him as he spun right in front of me and there was no way I could avoid him. It is sad to finish my career this way, but that is motor racing and I have to accept this situation.&quot; Räikkönen said he was unsure as to what caused the crash but called it &quot;a pretty big shunt and I have a bit of a head and neck ache, but otherwise I&#x27;m fine.&quot; Eddie Jordan, Jordan team principal, said he sympathised with Alesi but noticed the driver was philosophical about the crash. According to journalist David Tremayne of &quot;The Independent&quot;, the accident involving Alesi and Räikkönen prompted questions about the effectiveness of wheel tethers in the event of a car crash.

Häkkinen commented on his final race, &quot;I want to thank everybody who I have worked with for the past nine years for all the effort they put into making my career so successful. I&#x27;m happy that David finished on the podium, and I must admit that by letting him past I wanted to give him something back for the occasions in the past when he has helped me.&quot; McLaren team principal Ron Dennis felt Häkkinen had much personal discipline and was hard-working to become a Grand Prix winner. Coulthard confessed that he would probably not fully appreciate Häkkinen as a teammate if that was no longer the case. However, he noted that Häkkinen had been his benchmark for measuring how well he performed, and he was unhappy that his teammate was going before he got the chance to beat him.

Ferrari honoured their 2001 season achievements in front of Ferrari fans at the Monza Circuit on 21 October. Following their duel during the race, Barrichello stated that he regarded Ralf Schumacher as &quot;a bad loser,&quot; adding that he was ahead of the Williams driver at the final chicane and thought it unjust that he went straight. Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn acknowledged to taking a big risk by planning a three-stop strategy for Barrichello, believing he would be delayed behind the Williams cars, &quot;The only way he was going to finish second in the Championship was to win the race so we chose an extreme strategy.&quot; Nevertheless, Ferrari sporting director Jean Todt praised Barrichello&#x27;s performance in Japan, saying, &quot;I wish to thank Rubens for the great contribution he has made to the team. He has finished third in the drivers&#x27; championship at the end of a faultless year.&quot;

<text>The 2002 Malaysian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 17 March 2002 at the Sepang International Circuit and was the second round of the 2002 Formula One season. The Grand Prix is notable for the first lap collision between Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya and Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher, which led to Montoya being given a drive-through penalty. This decision led to much criticism for the Malaysian stewards, with Schumacher commenting that the decision was &quot;overly harsh&quot; on Montoya.

The Grand Prix was won by the Williams-BMW of German Ralf Schumacher, who commented that it was &quot;almost a perfect race&quot;. He was followed by teammate Montoya, and following them in third was Ralf&#x27;s brother, Michael Schumacher. The race was followed by a decision by the FIA to give stewards more powers over the punishments of drivers who are involved in incidents which are deemed &quot;avoidable&quot;. Also it would be Williams&#x27; only victory (and double) of the season, and one of only two races of the season that Ferrari failed to win (the other being the Monaco Grand Prix, won by McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard). The race was the only during the 2002 season that Michael Schumacher stood on the podium without being first or second.

== Practice ==
The Friday morning session saw the two Ferrari cars of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello fastest, the closest car to the Ferraris was Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld, who was over one and a half seconds slower. McLaren got the better of Ferrari for the second session with Kimi Räikkönen fastest and his teammate David Coulthard was just over half a second behind him, while the Ferrari of Schumacher was over a second slower than Räikkönen&#x27;s McLaren in third.

Like the Friday sessions, the Saturday sessions were split into two separate sessions, although both sessions were held during the morning. The Ferraris were fastest in the first session, although this time the closest non-Ferrari driver, which was Räikkönen, was under a second behind them. The Williams of Montoya was fastest in the final practice session before qualifying with Räikkönen second fastest and Montoya&#x27;s teammate, Ralf Schumacher, third fastest.

==Qualifying==
Qualifying saw Michael Schumacher take his first pole position of the 2002 season, with only the next three drivers being under a second slower than Schumacher&#x27;s time, the closest being Juan Pablo Montoya who was under a quarter of a second slower. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate, Barrichello and Montoya&#x27;s teammate, Ralf Schumacher, were third and fourth respectively.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
Before the parade lap, the Arrows of Heinz-Harald Frentzen stalled on the grid for the second time in succession. The German got his car running and managed retain his grid position.

The start of the race saw Michael Schumacher immediately cut Montoya, making the Colombian brake and avoid a collision, this allowed Barrichello to get alongside Montoya coming into the first corner. Montoya however managed to out-brake the Brazilian into the first corner and thus was alongside Schumacher going through the corner. As the Williams and Ferrari travelled through the corner, Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari started to experience understeer and went into Montoya&#x27;s car, taking the Ferrari front wing off. The incident left Montoya going wide and going off the track for a brief moment.

This left Barrichello in the lead with Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari, minus a front-wing, in second place and his brother Ralf in third. Michael Schumacher came into the pits for a new nose, promoting Ralf to second. The second lap saw a collision between the two Jordans of Giancarlo Fisichella and Takuma Sato, when the latter ran into the back of the former. &quot;I am really sorry about what happened,&quot; said Sato after the race, &quot;I apologized to Giancarlo immediately after the race and he took it very well which I think says a lot of good things about his character&quot; he added. On lap 7, Montoya was given a drive through penalty which cost the Colombian 20 seconds to Barrichello&#x27;s lead, it was the first drive through penalty in Formula One, as the penalty was added to the list of penalties for the stewards.

The race at the front was between Barrichello; Ralf Schumacher and the two McLarens of Räikkönen and David Coulthard. The two McLarens soon dropped out, both retirements were due to an engine failure. This left the Ferrari and the Williams to battle for the lead, albeit on different strategies, with Barrichello on two stops and Ralf on one-stop. Barrichello was 21 seconds ahead but rejoined 5 seconds behind after his second stop on lap 35. He then closed in on Ralf at a second a lap, and was just 1.2 seconds behind when his engine failed on lap 39, leaving Ralf over 30 seconds ahead of the field with Jenson Button second, with Montoya and Schumacher third and fifth in their recovery drives, with Nick Heidfeld between them.

Montoya got past Button, despite the Brit&#x27;s defensive driving and moved up into second behind his teammate. The Williams pair went on to finish first and second, making it the first Williams 1–2 since the 1996 Portuguese Grand Prix.

Button, who was now demoted to third, look on course to take his first podium finish of his F1 career, but a suspension problem gave the Ferrari of Michael Schumacher the last podium finish, leaving Button to take fourth place, his first points scoring finish for his new team, Renault. The final two points positions are taken by the two Saubers of Heidfeld and Massa; it was the first points scoring finish for Massa.

=== Post-race ===
The decision to penalise Montoya was met with a host of criticism. The head steward at the event, Nazir Hoosein, had a history of making strange decisions, as he was head steward at the 1998 British Grand Prix, where Michael Schumacher won the race in the pitlane, which led to Hoosein losing his license to be a steward for a year.

Michael Schumacher later commented that he thought it was &quot;overly harsh&quot; on Montoya for the incident, while Montoya himself commented that it was &quot;very unfair&quot; and that he &quot;gave Michael room&quot; and commented that Schumacher &quot;understeered and touched him&quot; before adding that &quot;it was a racing incident&quot;.

Championship wise, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship decreased by two points while the Williams team moved up to take the lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 22 points to Ferrari&#x27;s 14.

<text>The 2002 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXXI Grande Prêmio Marlboro do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 31 March 2002 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the third round of the 2002 Formula One season and the thirty-first Brazilian Grand Prix. The 71-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from the second position. Ralf Schumacher finished second for the Williams team with David Coulthard third in a McLaren.

Juan Pablo Montoya started from pole position alongside Michael Schumacher. Mika Salo scored his last world championship points at this race. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s win was his second of the season, his fourth and last at Interlagos, and the result meant that he extended his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to eight points over Ralf Schumacher and ten over Montoya. Ferrari reduced the lead of Williams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship to six points with fourteen races of the season remaining.

==Background==
The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, also known as constructors, were Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Sauber, Jordan, BAR, Renault, Jaguar, Arrows, Minardi and Toyota. Tyre suppliers Bridgestone and Michelin brought two new dry compounds for the race.

Going into the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 14 points, ahead of Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya with 12 points. Montoya&#x27;s teammate Ralf Schumacher was third on 10 points, ahead of McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen and Eddie Irvine for Jaguar. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams were leading with 22 points; eight points ahead of Ferrari with 14 points; McLaren were a further 10 points behind in third. Ferrari and Williams had so far dominated the championship, with Ralf Schumacher winning the Malaysian Grand Prix. Championship contender Montoya had gained second-place finishes, with Räikkonen achieving a third-place podium finishes.

Following the Malaysian Grand Prix on 17 March, the teams conducted testing sessions at the Circuit de Catalunya from 19–22 March. Jaguar concentrated on chassis development to decide whether to race their previous chassis, the R2 and concentrate development on the R3 with their test team, when the latter suffered from poor performance. McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz (McLaren) set the fastest time of the first day, while Rubens Barrichello (Ferrari) was fastest on the second and final days of testing, and Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) topped the third day&#x27;s running.

Ferrari&#x27;s main 2002 car, the F2002, was introduced that weekend; the team had been using a modified version of their 2001 car, the F2001, for the opening two rounds. Originally due to be introduced at the first race in Australia, problems with its performance had left the team to develop the car, delaying its debut. One chassis of the F2002 was made available to Michael Schumacher with teammate Barrichello using a modified F2001.

==Practice==
Four practice sessions were held before the race: two 60 minute sessions on Friday and two 45 minute sessions on Saturday. The Friday sessions were held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher set the session&#x27;s fastest time with a lap of 1:15.627, one second ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Giancarlo Fisichella was one-tenth of a second off Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s pace, with the two Sauber drivers fourth and fifth, Nick Heidfeld ahead of Felipe Massa with Arrows driver Enrique Bernoldi rounding out the top six. The session was disrupted by an incident as Räikkönen stalled after spinning off at the &quot;Descida do Sol&quot; corner—the incident required a suspension as marshals cleared the track of the car. In the second practice session, David Coulthard set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:15.075. The two Williams drivers were second and fourth, Montoya ahead of Ralf Schumacher; they were separated by Toyota driver Allan McNish. Michael Schumacher and Räikkönen completed the top six positions.
The Saturday practice sessions were again held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher again set the fastest lap with a time of 1:13.837. Räikkönen was the second fastest driver, edging closer to Michael Schumacher&#x27;s time during the session. Barrichello was third fastest, with the Williams drivers fourth and sixth, Ralf Schumacher ahead of Montoya; they were separated by Coulthard. In the final practice session, Ralf Schumacher set the fastest time of the session, a 1:13.543, two hundredths of a second ahead of Coulthard. The Renault drivers were running quicker, Jenson Button ahead of Jarno Trulli. Michael Schumacher and Räikkönen rounded out the top six. The session was disrupted by incidents as Massa&#x27;s car broke down—the stranded car required a suspension as marshals need to clear the track— and Takuma Sato spun off and struck the safety barriers at turn 7 and lost his car&#x27;s front wing. After the session&#x27;s conclusion, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) announced that Barrichello would have his fastest qualifying time stripped when it was determined that the Ferrari driver left the pitlane when closed. Sato was later given the same punishment for a similar offence.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Each driver was limited to twelve laps. Montoya achieved his first pole position of the season, his first at Interlagos, with a time of 1:13.114. He was joined on the front row by Michael Schumacher who was one-tenth of a second behind. Ralf Schumacher qualified third, having battled with Montoya for pole position early in the session and was also happy with the set-up of his car. Coulthard qualified fourth, though he was unhappy with his qualifying pace. Coulthard&#x27;s teammate Räikkönen qualified fifth having been forced to use his team&#x27;s spare car when his race car developed a hydraulic problem. Trulli, Button, Barrichello, Heidfeld and Mika Salo rounded out the top ten. Pedro de la Rosa bettered teammate Irvine when he qualified 11th; Felipe Massa split the two Jaguar drivers in 12th. Fisichella qualified 14th, with the only Canadian driver in the field, Jacques Villeneuve, managed 15th ahead of his BAR teammate Olivier Panis in 17th; they were separated by McNish in 16th. The Arrows and Minardi drivers qualified at the back of the field, covering positions 18 to 22 with Sato.

===Qualifying classification===

– The best times of Barrichello (1:13.919) and Sato (1:15.283) were canceled. It did not affect their starting positions, though. 

==Race==
The conditions for the race were dry with the air temperature and the track temperature ranged between . The drivers took to the track at 09:30 (UTC -3) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Michael Schumacher maintained his good form over the weekend by setting the fastest time of the session, a 1:15.866, half a second faster than de la Rosa, in second place. Räikkönen had the third fastest time, ahead of the Williams drivers in fourth and fifth—Ralf Schumacher ahead of Montoya—with Barrichello rounding out the top six. A crash by Bernoldi with two minutes of the session remaining caused his car to catch fire and required a red flag as the medical car was deployed to the scene. As medical car driver and former Formula One driver Alex Ribeiro stopped to assist Bernoldi, Heidfeld lost control and slid off the track, colliding with the car&#x27;s left door just after Ribeiro opened it.

The race started at 14:00 local time. Michael Schumacher made a good start, drawing alongside Montoya into the first corner. Montoya held the outside line for the turn, but Michael Schumacher overtook around the inside when Montoya ran wide. As the leading pair headed into the first straight, Montoya was in the slipstream off Michael Schumacher&#x27;s car and braked later than the Ferrari driver which resulted in Montoya losing his front wing. On lap 7, Fisichella&#x27;s car suffered an engine failure and became the first retirement of the race. Schumacher managed to narrowly win ahead of Ralf, but an unusual incident happened at the end of the race, when retired soccer star Pelé, who was tasked with waving the checkered flag, failed to notice the Schumachers approaching the line. He immediately waved by the time he realized his mistake, but did it on the Jordan of Takuma Sato, who was running two laps down on ninth and third-place finisher Coulthard.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies, and in the subsequent press conference.

The race result left Michael Schumacher extending his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 24 points. Ralf Schumacher was second with 16 points, two points ahead of Montoya and ten ahead of Button. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari reduced the lead of Williams to six points, and McLaren remained third on eight points with fourteen races of the season remaining.

<doc id="1123448" wikidata="Q317754" url="?curid=1123448" title="Ricardo Gardner">
<text>Ricardo Wayne Gardner (born 25 September 1978), commonly known as Bibi, is a Jamaican former professional footballer. He works as assistant coach at Portmore United. A left winger, he could also play in the centre of midfield or at left wing-back. He last played for Bolton Wanderers in May 2012, completing a 14-year spell at the club, of which 11 were spent in the Premier League. Gardner earned 111 caps for the Jamaica national football team, scoring 9 goals and playing at four CONCACAF Gold Cups and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

==Playing career==

===Club career===

====Early career====
Born in Saint Andrew, Jamaica, Gardner began his professional career with Harbour View, where he debuted as a starter at the age of only 14 years. He also, representing Wolmer&#x27;s Boys&#x27; High School, dominated the local high school football leagues and was considered outstanding. His performances for Jamaica during the 1998 World Cup attracted English First Division side Bolton Wanderers to offer Harbour View £1 million for his services.

====Bolton Wanderers====
Gardner immediately established himself a place in the first team for Bolton. He came on as a substitute to make his debut against Hartlepool in the League Cup on 25 August 1998, and made his league debut as a substitute again against West Bromwich Albion on 8 September 1998. In this game, Bolton were reduced to 10 men after the sending off of Guðni Bergsson shortly after Gardner came on, but he scored a late winner to give his team a memorable 3–2 victory over West Brom. He made 22 appearances, half of them starts, in his first year while scoring three goals. In his second season, 1999–2000, he established a place in the starting eleven, starting 23 of 26 games, that he has held on to since. Although Gardner suffered a cruciate ligament injury that took him out of action at the end of the season, he made a full recovery, and was able to return to the starting line-up in 2000–01 (scoring in the 2001 Division One Play off Final), playing with the promoted Bolton in the Premier League. He was voted Bolton Wanderers F.C. Player of the Year for the 2005–06 season by the club&#x27;s fans. Due to a knee injury, Gardner did not make his first appearance in the 2006–07 season until December.

In November 2007, he scored his first goal at club level in nearly five years when he opened the scoring in Bolton&#x27;s 2–2 draw against German giants Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the UEFA Cup group stage. A year later after being moved from a wing-back role back into midfield he scored in the Wanderers 2–0 win over local rivals Manchester City.

Gardner made his 400th appearance for Bolton in a 3–0 defeat to Fulham on 27 April 2011. On 24 May 2011, he was in discussions to extend his Bolton contract into a fourteenth year. Gardner rejected a move to West Ham United favouring to sign a new one-year contract at Bolton, which he signed on 5 August. He made four league appearances at the beginning of the next season but was sent off for two bookable offences in Bolton&#x27;s 3–1 defeat at Swansea City on 29 October and then suffered an injury, making no further appearances that year.

At the close of the January 2012 transfer window, he wasn&#x27;t named in Bolton&#x27;s twenty five man Premier League squad for the second half of the season meaning he would play no further part in the league campaign. It was later revealed that he had been omitted due to having had an operation on his knee that the Bolton medical staff could not guarantee he would recover from in time to play again that season. It was announced on 18 May 2012 that Ricardo had left the club in line with the expiration of his contract. At the time, Gardner was the second longest serving foreign player in Premier League history after serving fourteen years at Bolton, only beaten by his former Bolton teammate Jussi Jääskeläinen.

====Preston North End (loan)====
On 8 March 2011, Gardner went to Preston North End on an emergency one-month loan as cover for Phil Brown&#x27;s side. Bolton manager Owen Coyle said it was a great chance for Gardner to improve his match fitness after only just recovering from injury.

He made his debut the following day at the left-back position in the 2–1 loss to Leeds United and played three more games for the club.

====Retirement====
After the end of his contract with Bolton Wanderers, he spent a year training at his old club, West Ham United and Barnsley to keep up his fitness, and played in two reserve team matches for West Ham but decided to leave England to seek a move to the MLS. 
He went on an unsuccessful trial at Real Salt Lake where he played for the reserves in a 1–0 win against the Portland Timbers reserves and announced his official retirement in May 2014.

===International career===
Gardner rose to international prominence following the 1998 World Cup.
Gardner was an important player for the Jamaican national team and earned his place as the team&#x27;s captain, captaining the team between 2005 and 2009. He also captained the team for one game in 2012 at the 2012 Caribbean Cup.

==Coaching career==
In December 2015, Gardner was appointed as coach of the Jamaica U-20 team. Gardner resigned as Harbour View FC Head coach in December 2018. In March 2019, Gardner joined the staff of Portmore United as assistant coach. In 2021, Gardner left his role as head of Portmore United to move back to England.

==Personal life==
Gardner is a Rastafarian and sports dreadlocks. He is part owner, with Robert Scarlett and Ian Goodison, of a record label, Heart of Love Production, which promotes ragga and dancehall music.

<text>The 2002 Spanish Grand Prix (formally the XLIV Gran Premio Marlboro de España) was a Formula One motor race held on 28 April 2002 at the Circuit de Catalunya, Montmeló, Catalonia, Spain. It was the fifth round of the 2002 Formula One season and the forty-fourth Spanish Grand Prix. The 65-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari car after starting from pole position. Juan Pablo Montoya finished second driving for the Williams team, with David Coulthard third driving for McLaren.

As a consequence of the race, Schumacher extended his lead over Montoya who took over second position in the Drivers&#x27; Championship from his team-mate Ralf Schumacher to 21 points. In the Constructors Championship, Ferrari extended their lead over Williams to seven points.

==Background==
Heading into the fifth race of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 34 points; ahead of Williams driver and brother Ralf Schumacher on 20, and Juan Pablo Montoya on 17. Renault driver Jenson Button was fourth with 8 points and Rubens Barrichello on 6. The Constructors&#x27; Championship was closer at the front with Ferrari on 40 points leading Williams who were on 37.

==Practice and qualifying==
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour; the third and fourth sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each.

Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race.

The Minardi of Mark Webber sustained a rear wing failure on the main straight after he completed his 12th lap and the red flag was brought out afterwards.

===Qualifying classification===

 - Eddie Irvine was demoted to last place because of a fuel analysis which showed that the fuel was not the same as one of those approved for use by Jaguar prior to the event.

==Race==
The Stewards of the Meeting received a notice from KL Minardi Asiatech, informing them of their intention to withdraw from the 2002 Spanish Grand Prix due to a number of front and rear wing failures they suffered over the weekend. Having spoken to the Team Manager, the Stewards of the Meeting decided to accept the withdrawal of KL Minardi Asiatech from the event. During the race, Juan Pablo Montoya made his planned stop, with chief mechanic and lollipop man Carl Gaden signalling for Montoya to go, only to belatedly realise that the Williams was still being refuelled. Montoya reacted quickly having initially gone to launch away, only to stop right on Gaden&#x27;s foot as the rest of the pitcrew were bowled over. This would re-occur in the 2004 race. Michael Schumacher achieved his third Grand Slam at this race, and his first since 1994.

<doc id="1123457" wikidata="Q15607" url="?curid=1123457" title="2002 Austrian Grand Prix">
<text>The 2002 Austrian Grand Prix (formally the Grosser A1 Preis von Österreich 2002) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 May 2002 at the A1-Ring in Spielberg, Styria, Austria. It was the sixth round of the 2002 Formula One World Championship and the 25th Austrian Grand Prix as part of the Formula One World Championship. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the 71-lap race starting from third position. His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second, and Juan Pablo Montoya took third for the Williams team.

Michael Schumacher, who was the winner of four of the five preceding races in the season, led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship prior to the Grand Prix with his team Ferrari leading the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Barrichello started the race from the pole position after recording the fastest lap in qualifying; Williams driver Ralf Schumacher started second, but was passed by Michael Schumacher in the first corner. Barrichello maintained the lead through most of the race until Ferrari invoked team orders on him to allow Michael Schumacher to win the race on the final lap and improve his standing in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. It was his fourth victory in a row in the 2002 season and the 58th of his career. The safety car was deployed twice during the race, which included a major accident on lap 28 involving Jordan driver Takuma Sato and Nick Heidfeld of the Sauber team, who both sustained light injuries.

At the post-race podium ceremony, Michael Schumacher implored Barrichello to mount the stand reserved for the race winner and gave the first-place trophy to his teammate. That led the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA, Formula One&#x27;s governing body) to fine Ferrari, Michael Schumacher and Barrichello $1 million on 26 June; each paid a third immediately, while the remainder was suspended. Following a review, the FIA banned the practice of team orders beginning with the 2003 season; they began again allowing the practice following the 2010 season.

The win increased Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to 27 points over Montoya in second place. Ralf Schumacher came fourth to maintain third place, and Barrichello moved past David Coulthard of the McLaren team to fourth. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari further extended their advantage over Williams to 16 points. McLaren were another 36 points behind in third with eleven races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2002 Austrian Grand Prix was the 6th of 17 motor races in the 2002 Formula One World Championship, and the 25th time it formed part of the championship. The 71-lap race was held at the 9-turn A1 Ring in Spielberg, Styria, on 12 May. With very few sections requiring drivers competitors to slow down, the track gives teams an opportunity to push their engines to their full potential. 70 percent of the lap can be driven at full racing speed, although the circuit&#x27;s relatively high altitude of offers less oxygen to feed the combustion engines, reducing their performance by approximately seven percent.

Before the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 44 points. Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher of the Williams team were second and third with 23 and 20 points, respectively. Driving for McLaren, David Coulthard was fourth with nine points, and Jenson Button for Renault was a further point behind in fifth. Ferrari led the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 50 points, seven ahead of Williams in second place. McLaren with 13 points were third, with Renault and Sauber tied for fourth with eight points apiece.

Michael Schumacher, who had won four of the opening five Grands Prix in 2002, was strongly considered by the British press, bookmakers, and former drivers Gerhard Berger and Niki Lauda the favourite to win the Austrian Grand Prix, an event he had not won in four previous attempts. He said of his chances in Austria, &quot;We believe we have a very competitive package overall but it&#x27;s a question of how good the others can be.&quot; He expressed confidence he could challenge for victory saying, &quot;I certainly won&#x27;t be approaching this race any differently than the others. And with two almost perfect races behind us, I&#x27;m obviously looking forward to the Austrian Grand Prix with a lot of confidence.&quot; Montoya stated he would be better able to challenge Ferrari at the A1-Ring recalling the team&#x27;s strong form in 2001 despite scoring no points, &quot;I am pretty confident that in Austria we will be quite strong, certainly stronger than in [the prior race in] Barcelona, so I am looking forward to it.&quot;

For the Grand Prix, a total of 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) each entered two race drivers, with no changes from the season entry list. In technical developments, Sauber introduced a revised evolution of its Ferrari 050 engine that the team had used in the first five races of the 2002 championship. The team installed a new aerodynamic package that included a revised undertray, front wing and altered bodywork around the cover of the C21&#x27;s engine. The Ferrari, McLaren and Williams teams brought new front brake air intakes. Williams also used an upgraded front wing on its FW24, which was characterised by a curved profile.

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. The first practice session was held in cool and overcast weather. Michael Schumacher was fastest with a lap of 1 minute, 11.072 seconds with approximately ten minutes remaining. His teammate Barrichello, Felipe Massa and Nick Heidfeld of Sauber, Jordan drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Takuma Sato, Coulthard, Arrows&#x27; Heinz-Harald Frentzen, and the British American Racing (BAR) duo of Jacques Villeneuve and Olivier Panis, were second through tenth. Some drivers—including Barrichello, Massa and Fisichella—ran off the dusty, slippery track into a gravel trap during the session because of a low amount of grip; none sustained damage to their vehicles.

Conditions became warmer and sunnier for the second practice session though rainfall threatened towards the end. The fastest times were recorded within the first 20 minutes since the track temperature was at its warmest. Barrichello set the day&#x27;s fastest lap, at 1 minute, 10.549 seconds. His teammate Michael Schumacher was three-hundredths of a second slower in second position. Montoya, Kimi Räikkönen of the McLaren team, Allan McNish for Toyota, Arrows driver Enrique Bernoldi, Jaguar&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa, Panis, Coulthard and Sato were third to tenth. Some drivers, including Michael and Ralf Schumacher, and McNish, again lost control of their cars and ran off to the side of the track during the session. Heidfeld&#x27;s track time was curtailed after 20 minutes due to an alternator fault. Frentzen lost a quarter of an hour to familiarise himself with the track after he spun over a kerb and damaged his car&#x27;s undertray.

The third practice session took place in clear and dry weather; no drivers ventured off the less slippery circuit. Michael Schumacher used low track and ambient temperatures to become the first driver to go below 70 seconds all weekend with a lap of 1 minute, 9.001 seconds that he recorded half an hour in. His teammate Barrichello was second-fastest and Räikkönen third. Frentzen, Massa, Coulthard, Heidfeld, Panis, Button and Bernoldi followed in positions four through ten.

The ambient and track temperatures had increased by the start of the fourth practice session. Several competitors made driver errors sending them into the gravel. Michael Schumacher set the track lap record of 1 minute, 8.433 seconds. Barrichello was second, and Ralf Schumacher improved to third. Montoya, Frentzen, Massa, Heidfeld, Räikkönen, Panis and Villeneuve completed the top ten. Bernoldi missed 25 minutes due to a malfunctioning gearbox. He later lost control of the rear of his car at turn two and got beached in a gravel trap before the session ended.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon one-hour qualifying session saw each competitor limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by their fastest laps. The 107% rule was in effect during this session, requiring each driver set a time within 107 per cent of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Conditions were clear with warm air and track temperatures. Barrichello took his second pole position of the season and the fifth of his career with a lap of 1 minute, 8.082 seconds. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Ralf Schumacher, who took his best starting position of the year. Michael Schumacher was third; he said he lost speed due to a brake problem, and traffic slowed him. He switched to the spare Ferrari for his final timed lap in an unsuccessful attempt to claim pole position, and did not earn a front-row start for the first time since the 2001 Italian Grand Prix eight races earlier. A misfiring engine prompted Montoya in fourth to switch to the spare car setup for his teammate Ralf Schumacher; he made a minor tyre-pressure adjustment to record his fastest lap. Heidfeld took fifth, claiming he could have improved had Button not slowed his final timed lap. A lack of speed restricted the McLaren duo of Räikkönen and Coulthard to sixth and eighth; they were separated by Massa who made two driver errors in an unbalanced car through high-speed turns. Panis was ninth-fastest as de la Rosa slowed his final timed lap. Toyota&#x27;s Mika Salo in tenth had a minor understeer.

Frentzen in 11th spun on oil and removed some bodywork components from his car in a gravel trap. His vehicle was later repaired to continue driving. His Arrows&#x27; teammate Bernoldi followed in 12th and expressed satisfaction with his car&#x27;s balance. Traffic slowed Button on his four timed laps and left him 13th. McNish and Toyota located a car setup tailored to suit him, and took 14th. Fisichella ran a new engine in qualifying and took 15th with a car setup suited for used front and new rear tyres. Jarno Trulli had a major engine failure through turn nine and lost control of his Renault on oil. The session was stopped for 11 minutes for track marshals to dry the oil. Trulli returned to the garage and used the spare Renault setup for his teammate Button and took 16th after minor braking problems. Villeneuve used a new set of tyres for qualifying; he was uncomfortable with his car&#x27;s setup and was 17th. A handling imbalance created an unbalanced car for Sato in 18th. Jaguar&#x27;s de la Rosa and Eddie Irvine filled the grid&#x27;s tenth row: de la Rosa had a rear suspension fault caused by an exhaust overheating it and Irvine removed his front wing in a collision with the rear of Bernoldi&#x27;s vehicle into turn one. Minardi drivers Mark Webber and Alex Yoong started from the eleventh row: Webber optimised his PS02&#x27;s balance so it ran without any issues on its tyres during the session, and intermittent rear brake locking destabilised Yoong&#x27;s car causing him to spin after leaving the pit lane.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==

A half-hour warm-up session took place on Sunday morning, in clear and warm weather. All drivers fine-tuned their race setups for the weather and drove their spare cars. Barrichello had the fastest lap of 1 minute and 10.876 seconds and his teammate Michael Schumacher was second. Massa, Frentzen, Heidfeld, Bernoldi, Coulthard, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, and Irvine completed the top ten. While the session saw no major incidents, Ralf Schumacher entered the gravel traps at the two of the track&#x27;s corners.

After the warm-up session, Montoya predicted several drivers would run wide on a rumble strip located to the outside of the circuit, which extended from turn one to the first portion of the straight driving towards turn two, to increase the top speed of their cars. Ron Dennis, the team principal of McLaren, argued Ferrari should allow their drivers to race each other without the imposition of team orders favouring one driver over the other as had happened at the 2001 Austrian Grand Prix.

==Race==
The race began at 14:00 local time. It ran for 71 laps over a distance of . The weather was clear and dry. The air temperature was and the track temperature ranged from . Barrichello made a brisk start to maintain the lead into the first turn. While he provided room for drivers to pass him, none did. Behind Barrichello, his teammate Michael Schumacher made a fast start to slot into second position and Heidfeld rose from fifth to third having overtaken Ralf Schumacher on the outside. Räikkönen and Massa, meanwhile, drew alongside and Massa steered onto the grass dropping to tenth. Further back, Bernoldi made contact with the rear of his teammate Frentzen; both cars continued as Bernoldi entered the pit lane after the first lap. At turn two, an increase in speed led de la Rosa&#x27;s throttle pick-up to start to cut out. He slowed, and retired in the pit lane at the end of the lap. In the meantime, Villeneuve experienced a minor loss of car control and hit Frentzen&#x27;s car on the inside. The collision sent Frentzen into a gravel trap from which he slowly extricated himself.

At the end of the first lap, Barrichello led Michael Schumacher, Heidfeld, Ralf Schumacher, Montoya, and Coulthard. Heidfeld ran wide at Castrol Kurve at the beginning of the second lap and the Williams pair of Ralf Schumacher and Montoya demoted him to fifth. Barrichello and Michael Schumacher began to pull away from the rest of the field. There were overtakes further down the field. On lap two, Salo passed Button for eighth. Villeneuve overtook his teammate Panis for 14th position and Frentzen passed Webber on lap three. During the next, lap Yoong lost two places to his teammate Webber, and Frentzen. Bernoldi retired from the race with a broken front wing and front brake pipe. Räikkönen in seventh retired at the side of the track with an engine failure on lap six. On lap seven Villeneuve passed McNish for tenth place, then ran wide. He made a second, successful attempt on the eighth lap, passing McNish who opted against a challenge.

That same lap, Massa entered the pit lane to join the list of retirees with a failed left-rear suspension; it failed in turn two, causing the Sauber C21&#x27;s right-front wheel to lift from the tarmac surface and its undertray to scrape along it. Villeneuve made a pass on Fisichella for ninth place on lap ten. Not long after Villeneuve overtook Button for eighth position. By the same lap, Barrichello led by a second over his Michael Schumacher, who in turn was 17 seconds ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Further down the order, Frentzen put a rear wheel on the grass at the final corner on lap 16. He lost control of his car, spun through 180 degrees and rolled backwards in front of the race leaders. Frentzen fell to 18th position, behind the Minardi cars of Webber and Yoong. He passed Yoong to return to 17th position on the 18th lap. One lap later, Villeneuve overtook Salo on the inside for seventh place and blocked Salo&#x27;s attempted counter-move.

As the Ferraris extended their lead over Ralf Schumacher, the stewards informed the BAR team on the 23rd lap Villeneuve had incurred a drive-through penalty as they deemed him at fault for the collision with Frentzen on lap one. Lap 24 saw the safety car&#x27;s first deployment by the race director: Panis&#x27; engine seized without warning on the start/finish straight. His rear wheels locked, spun to the centre of the track and avoided hitting the barrier. Track marshals removed Panis&#x27; car from the circuit as he returned to the pit lane. The Ferrari and Williams&#x27; teams employed different pit stop strategies—the Ferrari team planned for two stops whereas the Williams team planned one. The Ferrari team called Barrichello and Michael Schumacher into the pit lane for their first pit stops; Schumacher drove more slowly than Barrichello to allow their mechanics to service the latter&#x27;s car first. Barrichello retained the lead as Michael Schumacher yielded second to Ralf Schumacher. The safety car was withdrawn at the conclusion of the 27th lap and Barrichello led at the restart.

Soon after, a major accident prompted the safety car&#x27;s second deployment on lap 28. As the field entered the right-hand turn two situated atop a hill, Heidfeld noticed smoke coming from Yoong&#x27;s Minardi and applied his cold brakes heavily, locking his rear wheels and sending him out of control about from the apex. He veered into the grass at approximately as his car spun 180 degrees; the grass did not slow him, and was launched over the crest of a hill. Montoya on the inside was about to lap Sato&#x27;s slower car at turn two, with the latter ahead at the apex. At high speed, Heidfeld narrowly avoided hitting Montoya&#x27;s front wing, and the rear of his Sauber sustained a side collision against the right-hand sidepod of Sato&#x27;s car, causing heavy damage to both vehicles and littering carbon fibre and titanium debris over a wide area of track. Heidfeld&#x27;s rear structure and titanium gearbox punctured a hole in Sato&#x27;s car; his knees struck the steering column breaking it in half. Both drivers were sent into a gravel trap and came to a stop there.

A visibly shaken Heidfeld was extricated from his car by track marshals with a heavily bruised left leg. After Sato&#x27;s car absorbed enough energy in the accident, he remained in it with soft-tissue damage to his right thigh, but did not lose consciousness; a section of the Sauber&#x27;s rear crash structure penetrated the side of the Jordan&#x27;s monocoque just below Sato&#x27;s right knee and his helmet was squeezed between the car&#x27;s head restraint, both of which stopped him leaving his car. The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA, Formula One&#x27;s governing body) safety and medical delegate Sid Watkins and his team took ten minutes to remove Sato from the car and treated him at the crash site before transporting him by ambulance to the track&#x27;s medical centre. From there, Sato and Heidfeld were flown by helicopter to Graz University Hospital, for overnight observation and precautionary x-ray scans. Under safety car conditions, every team apart from Ferrari and Williams brought their drivers to the pit lane for additional fuel and a set of tyres. After 20 minutes, the race restarted at lap 36&#x27;s end when the safety car entered the pit lane. Barrichello led Ralf Schumacher, Michael Schumacher, Montoya, Coulthard and Fisichella. On lap 37, Webber passed Yoong for 13th.

Villeneuve passed Fisichella for sixth place at the start of the 38th lap. On the same lap, Irvine entered the pit lane to retire with hydraulics failure. Two laps later, Villeneuve caught and overtook Coulthard at turn one for fifth. Coulthard lost sixth place to Fisichella after driving on oil and off the circuit on the 45th lap. On the same lap Trulli pulled over at the end of the pit lane wall on the main straight to retire from with a loss of fuel pressure. Yoong retired with fire visible from the rear of his Minardi soon after. Green flag pit stops began on lap 47. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop and dropped to fifth position. Montoya remained on the track for another four laps and used more fuel in an attempt to overtake Ralf Schumacher. Montoya entered the pit lane for tyres on the 51st lap. He returned to the race in fourth position, ahead of his teammate Ralf Schumacher. Villeneuve was elevated to third position until a pit stop on lap 53 demoted him to ninth. Montoya and Ralf Schumacher returned to third and fourth respectively.

Barrichello entered the pit lane for the second time on the 61st lap. His fuel stop took 6.2 seconds and he exited in second place. Michael Schumacher led lap 62 and made his second pit stop at the end of the lap. He returned to the race in second position; Barrichello returned to first. On the 63rd lap, as the pits had been completed and as had been discussed prior to race according to Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn, Todt invoked team orders on Barrichello to relinquish the victory to his teammate. This would improve Michael Schumacher&#x27;s position in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, with a win earning him ten points. In a 2012 interview, Barrichello stated that, whilst he was not allowed to say exactly what was Ferrari&#x27;s threat, &quot;it was a form of threat that made [him] think about re-thinking [his] life, because the great joy for [him] was driving&quot;. Barrichello radioed Todt of a promise he made (after the same race in 2001) not to relinquish a victory to a driver. This prompted Todt to reply to Barrichello he was required to obey his instruction in order to preserve Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;best interests&quot;. Personnel on the Ferrari pit gantry observed the television screens and noticed Michael Schumacher could not get close enough to pass Barrichello in the final seven laps.

At the start of the final lap, Barrichello led Michael Schumacher by one second. As Barrichello entered the final corner, Brawn informed Michael Schumacher over the radio his teammate would yield to him. When Barrichello braked in the final to comply with Ferrari&#x27;s instruction, Michael Schumacher slowed more than his teammate because he had hoped that no team orders would be applied. Schumacher passed Barrichello for his fourth win in a row in 2002, and the 58th of his career in a time of 1 hour, 33 minutes and 51.562 seconds at an average speed of . Barrichello was 0.182 seconds behind in second position with Montoya 17.7 seconds adrift in third. Montoya&#x27;s teammate Ralf Schumacher finished in fourth place. Fisichella was fifth and took the first two points of the season for the Jordan team. Coulthard took the final point in sixth position, ahead of Button&#x27;s Renault and the Toyota cars of Salo and McNish. A loss of hydraulic pressure caused Villeneuve&#x27;s engine to fail on the final lap; he was classified tenth. Frentzen and Webber for the Arrows and Minardi teams were the final finishers, albeit two laps behind the race winner.

==Post-race==
The Ferrari team were booed, jeered, whistled at and given a thumbs down signal by the crowd in &quot;parc fermé&quot; and on the podium. Michael Schumacher insisted Barrichello mount the first step on the podium, as &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; was played. Schumacher then stood beside his teammate when &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; played. Wolfgang Schüssel, the Chancellor of Austria, presented the winner&#x27;s trophy to Schumacher who proceeded to give it to Barrichello. Barrichello&#x27;s race engineer Gabriele Delli Colli joined him on the podium to receive the winning manufacturer&#x27;s award. Later in the press conference, where loud boos were heard, Barrichello said of the situation, &quot;I&#x27;m going through a period of a very good time of my life. I&#x27;m becoming a better person, a better driver, so there&#x27;s no point in arguing. I think my determination will bring me a lot more wins, so that&#x27;s the way I see it, so there&#x27;s no point arguing.&quot; Michael Schumacher said he understood Ferrari&#x27;s decision as &quot;the team is investing a lot of money for one sort of target and imagine in the end it wouldn&#x27;t be enough by this amount of points, how stupid would we look?&quot; Montoya said the two safety car periods allowed him to pass his teammate Ralf Schumacher, &quot;Ralf was quite quick out of the pits as well, but I managed to get a few laps in really quick right before the stop and that was enough.&quot;

Sato and Heidfeld were deemed fit to compete at the Monaco Grand Prix held two weeks later after passing fitness tests. Sid Watkins told Eddie Jordan, the owner of the Jordan team, that Sato had &quot;a miraculous escape&quot;, leading Jordan to remark, &quot;Somebody up there likes him.&quot; Sato said he had not observed Heidfeld approaching him, &quot;When I opened my eyes I could see my legs were squashed by the damaged monocoque and I could see the ground through the hole. Although there was some pain, I knew nothing was broken. The car did a great job of saving me – I hear there was nothing left of it.&quot; Heidfeld admitted he was at fault for causing the crash, &quot;I saw a cloud of tyre smoke as [Alex] Yoong braked really hard and early ahead of us, and maybe I pressed the pedal too hard as a result while the brakes were still cool. The car got away from me and next thing I knew I was going backwards down the grass.&quot; That the injuries Sato sustained in the accident were minor was cited as a consequence of improved safety standards undertaken by the FIA, racing teams and medical experts since the 1970s.

Ralf Schumacher praised his car for allowing him to finish fourth, &quot;Due to the action packed race and the different strategies it is difficult to say how big Ferrari&#x27;s advantage really was here on the A1-Ring. We have to continue to work hard, this much is clear.&quot; Fisichella commented on his fifth-place finish, &quot;It&#x27;s been a very, very good day for me, as I didn&#x27;t expect to score points. But, the most important thing is that Takuma is alright. It felt fantastic when I crossed the line and I would like to say thank you to the team, especially because we made the right pit stop decision.&quot; The race result increased Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 27 points over Montoya in second. Ralf Schumacher was third with 23 points. Barrichello overtook Coulthard for fourth with 12 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari further extended their advantage over the Williams team to 16 points. McLaren maintained third position with 14 points. The Renault and Sauber teams continued to hold fourth and fifth places with eleven races left in the season.

===Team orders===
Although they have been part of the history of Formula One since its very beginning and continuining into the 21st century, being a team sport, Ferrari&#x27;s use of team orders to determine the finishing order overshadowed the race. Reuters cited it as the most &quot;particularly blatant&quot; application of team orders applied to favour one driver over another since Coulthard relinquished first position to his McLaren teammate Mika Häkkinen in the final laps of the 1998 Australian Grand Prix to comply with a prior agreement. This and other team orders during the season, such as the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, prompted some discussions about the issue but did not lead to any ban; in both cases, Coulthard and Barrichello decided to slowdown only at the last moments of the final lap, which made it even more controversial, and Couthard also allegedly received threats over the radio. Ferrari were heavily condemned by fans on the internet, some members of the Formula One community, the world press, and Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Despite being a supporter of Ferrari and Michael Schumacher, Australian commentator Darrell Eastlake argued that it was the &quot;most bloody disgraceful thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life&quot; and Schumacher &quot;should have had the balls to move aside and let Barrichello win&quot;. Some Formula One figures held different views, including the Williams pair of Montoya and Ralf Schumacher, as well as Irvine, who all stated their belief Michael Schumacher should not be apportioned blame for winning the Grand Prix through team orders. Jody Scheckter (the 1979 Formula One World Champion) and Ron Dennis defended Ferrari&#x27;s application of team orders as a means of enhancing Michael Schumacher&#x27;s position in the championship.

The day after the race, the FIA summoned Ferrari and its drivers to a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 26 June to explain why the team ordered Barrichello to yield the victory to Michael Schumacher and their actions on the podium. At a press conference on 24 May, FIA president Max Mosley stated while Ferrari had not transgressed the regulations concerning team orders, the meeting would establish the appropriate punishment in the event a panel deemed if any rules were broken, &quot;There are rules about interfering with competition but we established a long time ago that team orders are allowed.&quot; That same day, Mosley said on the FIA&#x27;s behalf he wrote a letter of apology to Schüssel. At the meeting, the FIA deemed Ferrari to have transgressed series regulations when Michael Schumacher chose not to mount the first position on the podium and handed the trophy given to him by the Chancellor of Austria to his teammate Barrichello. The council also determined the team had not committed any violation when it invoked team orders on Barrichello to relinquish the victory to Michael Schumacher. It imposed a fine of $1 million on Ferrari, Michael Schumacher, and Barrichello, half of which was paid immediately and divided into equal amounts between the trio; the remainder was suspended for one year on the condition a similar offence did not occur. Neither a points deduction nor a race ban were imposed.

In response to the controversy, Mosley established a four-member working group to discuss team orders and invited the public to lend their opinion on the practice on the FIA&#x27;s website. The FIA accepted feedback from 5 July to 1 September, which was passed on to the working group. They reviewed it and gave their recommendations to the governing body. At a meeting of the 26-member Formula One Commission on 28 October, it was confirmed &quot;team orders that interfere with the race result&quot; would be barred from the 2003 season onwards. Thereafter, teams employed coded messages to loophole the rule on team orders. During the 2010 German Grand Prix, Ferrari employed a coded message to invoke team orders allowing driver Fernando Alonso, who was 31 points ahead of his teammate going into the race, to pass Massa and win the race; Ferrari denied that it was a team order. The parallels between how Michael Schumacher and Alonso won those races was the catalyst of the FIA rescinding the regulation barring team orders because it was deemed difficult to enforce. Despite both being legal as in Austria, team orders since then, most notability the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix and its Multi 21, which was in fact not respecting the team order, and the 2018 Russian Grand Prix, which was more similar to Austria, continued to echo controversy or criticism.

Although Ferrari and Michael Schumacher were the reigning World Champions, they had narrowly lost the 1997 and 1998 championships, in addition to the 1999 Drivers&#x27; Championship, despite Micheal Schumacher letting his World Championship contender teammate Eddie Irvine win upon his return from injury, and Formula One World Championships had been decided by less than the four points Barrichello gave up, a point that was also made by Ross Brawn. During the 2002 season, Ferrari continued to use team orders, including telling Michael Schumacher to hold position behind Barrichello for another one-two finish a month later at the 2002 European Grand Prix and at the 2002 Hungarian Grand Prix, as Michael Schumacher vowed to pay back Barrichello, who also went on to win the 2002 Italian Grand Prix, for giving him the win in Austria; they did not cause any significant uproar or controversy, as they were limited to tell the drivers to hold position rather than exchange it as was done in Austria. Months later at the 2002 United States Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher went for a dead heat finish with Barrichello, who ultimately won by 0.011 seconds, and was interpreted as a way of repaying Barrichello for Austria, a hypothesis Ferrari rejected. In November 2010, Todt admitted to &quot;La Stampa&quot; he should have avoided invoking team orders on Barrichello due to his subsequent belief Michael Schumacher would have won the championship without significant competition. In February 2017, Brawn reiterated Todt&#x27;s opinion to British magazine &quot;Autosport&quot; and stated the negative consequences for Formula One outweighed the positives, calling it &quot;on reflection ... a mistake&quot;.

<text>The 2002 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 26 May 2002 at the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo. It was the seventh race of the 2002 Formula One World Championship, and the sixtieth Monaco Grand Prix.

The 78-lap race was won by British driver David Coulthard, driving a McLaren-Mercedes. Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya took pole position in his Williams-BMW but was beaten off the line by Coulthard, who went on to lead every lap. German Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari with his brother, Ralf Schumacher, third in the other Williams-BMW. This race marked the last occasion during the 2002 season in which a team other than Ferrari would win as Ferrari would subsequently win all 10 of the remaining rounds in the 2002 season after this.

Heinz-Harald Frentzen&#x27;s sixth place finish was the last point ever scored by the Arrows team before the team folded later that year.

==Qualifying report==
Juan Pablo Montoya emerged on top in qualifying. David Coulthard took pole position at the 2001 Monaco Grand Prix, only to stall on the grid, but was forced to settle for second this time, nearly four tenths of a second off the Colombian&#x27;s pace. The championship leader and the last race victor, Michael Schumacher, could only set the third fastest time after suffering with an eye irritation throughout the session. Ralf Schumacher lined up fourth, ahead of Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s Ferrari and Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s McLaren.

Throughout free practice, the Renault team, and in particular Jarno Trulli, had looked set to challenge the established front-runners, but the Italian would only line up in 7th position, one position ahead of team-mate Jenson Button. On their first appearance at Monaco, the Toyotas of Mika Salo and Allan McNish completed the top ten, ahead of Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s Jordan and Heinz-Harald Frentzen&#x27;s Arrows. Sauber had a troubled session, with Felipe Massa and Nick Heidfeld lining up 13th and 17th respectively. The 1996 winner Olivier Panis was 18th for BAR, while Eddie Irvine lined up in 21st for Jaguar.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
Coulthard made the most of a sluggish start from Montoya to take the lead into Sainte-Devote for the first time, as Michael Schumacher held third position from his brother. Meanwhile, there was commotion behind, as Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s BAR failed to get off the grid with clutch problems. The Canadian would rejoin the race one lap down. There were also problems for Button, who incurred a drive-through penalty for jumping the start, despite the fact he then bogged down, and had dropped nine places to 17th by the end of the first lap. At the front, Coulthard remained in the lead, but unable to strengthen his advantage, with the top four rarely covered by more than a second. The Scot did gradually increase his advantage and by the time a dozen laps had been run, Coulthard&#x27;s lead was up to just over a second, with Montoya holding off Michael Schumacher by a similar amount.

However, the top Williams was having problems keeping pace with the lead car, and was gradually dropping back, delaying Schumacher in the process. The German was the first of the front-runners to stop - doing so on lap 44, and therefore removing the slower Montoya from his path, before, ironically the Colombian was forced out with engine failure later that lap. Schumacher had clearly been delayed by the slower Williams, as he emerged from the pits to set the fastest lap of the race and close in on Coulthard. With the Scot&#x27;s tyres much more worn than Schumacher&#x27;s, the McLaren team had no choice but to call in Coulthard early, with the Scot rejoining with a one-second advantage. Now armed with new tyres himself, Coulthard had the measure of Schumacher, and although the pair circulated nose-to-tail for the remainder of the race, Coulthard recorded his first victory for over a year, while Michael Schumacher&#x27;s second position extended his championship lead to 33 points.

There was plenty of action further down the field, with Ralf Schumacher taking third, despite a late pit-stop to replace a damaged tyre. Trulli followed up his promising times earlier in the weekend by holding off the Jordan of Giancarlo Fisichella for fourth position. Behind Fisichella, Heinz-Harald Frentzen took sixth place, although had it not been for a fuel rig problem that necessitated an extra pit-stop, he could well have taken fourth. Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s disappointing weekend ended with seventh position, after making a second pit-stop to repair damage caused by smashing into Räikkönen at the chicane, in a move that put the McLaren driver out of the race. Barrichello received a 10-second stop-go penalty for causing the accident. Nick Heidfeld took eighth, ahead of the Jaguars of Eddie Irvine and Pedro de la Rosa. Minardi&#x27;s Mark Webber had been on target for a top ten finish, only to have to make a late pit-stop which dropped him to eleventh. Enrique Bernoldi was the twelfth and last finisher, despite damaging his car in a clash with Massa and incurring a drive-through penalty for cutting the chicane.

Allan McNish spun his Toyota into the tyres at Sainte-Devote on lap 15. Takuma Sato clattered into the barriers before the chicane on lap 22 while trying to let his Jordan team-mate Fisichella past. Minardi&#x27;s Alex Yoong was another driver to clash with the barriers, and although he made it back to the pits, his suspension was too damaged for him to continue. Panis and Button collided at Sainte-Devote on lap 51 and were forced out with accident damage, Panis subsequently admitting he had not seen the Renault on the inside of him. More spectacular was the shunt that ended Massa&#x27;s race after his Sauber was badly damaged after a confrontation with the Sainte-Devote tyre wall. Jacques Villeneuve had earlier departed with an engine failure, while Toyota&#x27;s Mika Salo was the final retirement of the day after brake failure forced him into the barriers.

<text>The 2002 Canadian Grand Prix was the eighth round of the 2002 Formula One season and was held on 9 June 2002 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. Michael Schumacher won his sixth Grand Prix of the season and his fifth Canadian Grand Prix win. Schumacher fended off the challenges of Juan Pablo Montoya, who later retired, and his teammate Rubens Barrichello, whose race strategy cost him a chance of victory and demoting him to third. Fresh off his victory at Monaco, David Coulthard finished second in the race and earned his fourth podium finish of the season.

==Background==
The Canadian Grand Prix is the first race of the season were the cars run in a low downforce configuration. The previous Canadian Grand Prix, Ralf Schumacher in the Williams won comfortably from Michael Schumacher thanks to the power of the BMW engine. However this time, it is believed that Ferrari have closed the gap considerably in terms of engine power and therefore expect a showdown between the 2 teams with tyres playing a major role in the outcome of the race.
Behind those two teams, no one will come close but expect a fight between Sauber, Renault, McLaren and possibly the Honda runners.

The previous week before the race, all the Formula 1 teams were testing. With the exception of Minardi, all the teams were testing at Silverstone but due to changing weather conditions, it was hard to read anything into the times. Ferrari were also testing at Monza while BAR had a private session at Circuit Paul Ricard to test the new components to be used here and that includes a new engine, gearbox and aero package. Minardi also conducted a 2-day test at Vairano.

==Qualifying==
Juan Pablo Montoya in the Williams secured his third pole position of the season and the sixth of his career after seeing off a close challenge from world championship leader, Michael Schumacher. Montoya posted a 1m 12.836s to beat his arch-rival Schumacher by just 0.182s.

Montoya was the only driver to break the 1m 13s barrier and he did it twice. Schumacher`s chances of retaliating at the end of the session were spoiled by a few spots of rain that affected one or two parts of the track. Montoya quoted, &quot;The car has been very competitive so far, and the tyres play a very important role. It is going to be an interesting race tomorrow where strategy and tyres will be important factors.&quot;

Michael Schumacher`s teammate Rubens Barrichello lined up third, despite an accident during Saturday morning final free practice session and a spin towards the end of qualifying. He starts just ahead of Michelin drivers Ralf Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen. Ralf Schumacher, the winner of the previous Canadian Grand Prix had a technical problem, meant that he had to switch to the T-car which was set for Montoya. Ralf quoted, &quot;The T-car was set up for Juan but I have managed to take the best out of it anyway. I am confident for the race, also because I am sure that Michelin are competitive here.&quot;
David Coulthard in the McLaren and Jarno Trulli in the Renault were the other Michelin drivers to crack the top 10. It was a dramatic session for Trulli, who was hindered when he smashed his race chassis into one of the circuit`s concrete retaining walls and had to return the crippled car to the pit lane before switching to his team`s spare chassis for his final run.
Jenson Button in the Renault led the remaining Michelin runners, ahead of Eddie Irvine, Pedro de la Rosa, Mika Salo, Allan McNish, Mark Webber and Alex Yoong. De la Rosa had to abort one run because of a spin. Yoong failed to complete the last of four qualifying laps because a technical problem forced him to pull off the track.
Local favourite Jacques Villeneuve in the BAR started ninth, his best grid position of the season. Italian Giancarlo Fisichella gave the Jordan team heart by posting his first top-six qualifying performance of the season, but his teammate Takuma Sato&#x27;s session was ruined by a spectacular engine failure.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
Montoya got the jump at the start, to lead into the first hairpin, with Barrichello slotting in ahead of Michael Schumacher for second. Räikkönen moved up to fourth ahead of Ralf Schumacher, while a good start elevated Coulthard ahead of Nick Heidfeld and Giancarlo Fisichella. Montoya&#x27;s lead only lasted for the opening lap, however, as the Colombian ran wide at the final chicane, allowing Barrichello the run into the first corner, and the race lead. The Ferrari driver began to gradually extend his lead, but with the Brazilian on a two-stop strategy, he would need to make up a comfortable margin to be able to retain it after the stops. However, his strategy went up in smoke on lap fifteen, when the Safety Car was deployed for Villeneuve&#x27;s stranded BAR, whose engine had failed.

Montoya used this break to make his first stop, emerging in fifth place, while Barrichello stayed out in the lead. However, fate seemed to be smiling on the Colombian, as he quickly passed Räikkönen and Ralf Schumacher after the two delayed each other at the final chicane. Barrichello made his first stop on lap 26 dropping down the field as Michael Schumacher inherited the lead until his stop 12 laps later. This allowed Montoya back into the lead for a second time, but Schumacher resumed just 3.6 seconds behind, with the Williams driver still needing to make another stop. That he did fourteen laps later, but he had been unable to exploit his lighter car and rejoined nearly nine seconds behind the championship leader. However, Montoya had no chance of a straight race with the German, as the problematic BMW powerplant forced the Williams driver to make an early exit. Both Saubers and Toyota&#x27;s Mika Salo received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pitlane while Minardi&#x27;s Alex Yoong received a 10-second stop-go penalty for the same reason.

With Montoya out, Schumacher was able to take it easy, while his teammate set about Coulthard for second position, after the Scot had passed both Barrichello and Räikkönen during the pit stops. However, the Brazilian was unable to find a way past, and had to settle for the third spot on the podium, with Räikkönen taking fourth position 30 seconds behind. Fisichella took his third consecutive fifth-place finish, with Trulli claiming the final point. Williams&#x27; miserable day was completed when Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s fuel hose failed during his pit stop, necessitating another a visit to the pits, which would drop him to seventh. Having failed to finish any of the previous eight Grand Prix, Olivier Panis took a morale boosting eighth position, ahead of Felipe Massa&#x27;s Sauber. Takuma Sato made up for his Monaco crash with a conservative tenth-place finish, ahead of Mark Webber and Nick Heidfeld, who was forced to take two drive-through penalties after his speed-limiter failed. Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Alex Yoong completed the finishers.

Frentzen&#x27;s teammate Enrique Bernoldi was an early casualty after a persistent vibration, while Pedro De La Rosa&#x27;s Jaguar survived an early skirmish with McNish, but later retired as a result of gearbox dramas. The second Jaguar of Irvine only lasted twelve laps longer before its engine blew, while neither Toyota made the finish either; Mika Salo succumbed to brake problems, while McNish spun off. Britain&#x27;s Jenson Button was the final retirement of the race with an engine failure five laps from the end.

Canada had been seen as one of Williams&#x27; best chances to close on Ferrari, but as the Italian team took fourteen points, they left empty-handed. This was Ferrari&#x27;s 150th Formula 1 victory.

<doc id="1123467" wikidata="Q748720" url="?curid=1123467" title="Institutions of the European Union">
<text>The institutions of the European Union are the seven principal decision-making bodies of the European Union and Euratom governed under the Treaties of the European Union and European Union law. They are, as listed in Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union: 
* the European Parliament, 
* the European Council (of heads of state or government),
* the Council of the European Union (of member state ministers, a council for each area of responsibility),
* the European Commission, 
* the Court of Justice of the European Union, 
* the European Central Bank and 
* the European Court of Auditors.
Institutions are distinct from both advisory bodies to the European Union and agencies of the European Union.

==History==

Most EU institutions were created with the establishment of the European Community in 1958. Much change since then has been in the context of shifting the balance of power away from the council and towards the Parliament. The role of the commission has often been to mediate between the two or tip the balance. However, the commission is becoming more accountable to the Parliament: in 1999 it forced the resignation of the Santer Commission and forced a reshuffle of the proposed Barroso Commission in 2004. The development of the institutions, with incremental changes from treaties and agreements, is testament to the evolution of the Union&#x27;s structures without one clear &quot;master plan.&quot; Some observers like Tom Reid of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said of the institutions that &quot;nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU.&quot;

===Under the Treaty of Paris===
The first institutions were created at the start of the 1950s with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), based on the Schuman declaration, between six states. The ECSC was designed to bring the markets of coal and steel, the materials needed to wage war, under the control of a supranational authority with the aim of encouraging peace and economic development. It established the first institutions. At its core was an independent executive called the &quot;High Authority&quot; with supranational powers over the Community. The laws made by the Authority would be observed by a Court of Justice in order to ensure they were upheld and to arbitrate.

During the negotiations, two supervisory institutions were put forward to counterbalance the power of the High Authority. The &quot;Common Assembly&quot; proposed by Jean Monnet to act as a monitor, counterweight and to add democratic legitimacy was composed of 78 national parliamentarians. The second was the Council of Ministers, pushed by the smaller states also to add an intergovernmental element and harmonise national policies with those of the authority.

===Establishment and changes===
In 1957 the Treaties of Rome established two similar communities, creating a common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however, they had a separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The reason for this is the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranational and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the council a greater role in checking the executive.

The three communities were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried over from the European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However, this was delayed by the council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the council by giving it a key role in the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.

The 2009 Lisbon Treaty brought nearly all policy areas (including the budget) under the co-decision procedure (renamed &quot;ordinary legislative procedure&quot;), hence increasing the power of the Parliament. The rules for the distribution of seats in the parliament were also changed to a formula system. The High Representative merged with the European Commissioner for External Relations and joined the commission. The appointment of the Commission President became dependent upon the last EU elections. The Council of Ministers adopted more qualified majority voting and the European Council was made a distinct institution with a permanent president. The Court of Justice had some minor renaming and adjustments. In addition, the central bank became a full institution.

==Overview==
===Organisational chart===
==List==
There are three political institutions which hold the executive and legislative power of the union. The Council of the European Union represents governments, the parliament represents citizens and the commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the Council of the European Union, parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the commission. The commission then drafts this and presents it to the parliament and the Council of the European Union, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although the exact nature of this depends upon the legislative procedure in use, once it is approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law. The commission&#x27;s duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply.

===European Parliament===
The &quot;European Parliament&quot; (EP) shares the legislative and budgetary authority of the Union with the Council of the European Union (of relevant national government ministers). Its 705 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. They represent nearly 500 million citizens (the world&#x27;s second largest democratic electorate) and form the only directly elected body in the Union. Despite forming one of the two legislative chambers of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some sensitive areas, and does not have legislative initiative. It does, however, have powers over the Commission which the Council does not. It has been said that its democratic nature and growing powers have made it one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.

The Parliament&#x27;s President (its speaker) is Roberta Metsola (European People&#x27;s Party), who was elected from the Parliament&#x27;s members in 2022.

===European Council===

The &quot;European Council&quot; is the group of heads of state or government of the EU member states. It meets four times a year to define the Union&#x27;s policy agenda and give impetus to integration. The President of the European Council is the person responsible for chairing and driving forward the work of the institution, which has been described as the highest political body of the European Union.

The current president is António Costa (since 1 December 2024).

===Council of the European Union===
The &quot;Council of the European Union&quot; (informally known as the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; or just the &quot;Council&quot;) is a body holding legislative and some limited executive powers and is thus the main decision-making body of the Union. Its Presidency rotates between the states every six months, but every three Presidencies now cooperate on a common programme. This body is separate from the European Council, which is a similar body, but is composed of national leaders.

The council is composed of twenty-seven national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

The presidency is being held by Poland since January 2025.

===European Commission===
The &quot;European Commission&quot; (EC) is the executive arm of the Union. It is a body composed of one appointee from each state, currently twenty-seven, but is designed to be independent of national interests. The body is responsible for drafting all law of the European Union and has the ability to propose new laws (bills). It also deals with the day-to-day running of the Union and has the duty of upholding the law and treaties (in this role it is known as the &quot;Guardian of the Treaties&quot;).

The commission is led by a President who is nominated by the council (in practice the European Council) and approved by Parliament. The remaining 26 Commissioners are nominated by member states, in consultation with the President, and have their portfolios assigned by the President. The Council then adopts this list of nominee-Commissioners. The council&#x27;s adoption of the commission is not an area which requires the decision to be unanimous; their acceptance is arrived at according to the rules for qualified majority voting. The European Parliament then interviews and casts its vote upon the Commissioners. The interviews of individual nominees are conducted separately, in contrast to Parliament&#x27;s vote of approval which must be cast on the commission as a whole without the ability to accept or reject individual Commissioners. Once approval has been obtained from the Parliament, the Commissioners can take office. The current President is Ursula von der Leyen (EPP); her commission was elected in 2019.

===Court of Justice of the European Union===
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ( or &quot;CJUE&quot;; Latin: Curia) is the judicial branch of the European Union (EU) and is responsible for interpreting EU law and treaties.

The CJUE consists of two separate courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court.

From 2005 to 2016 it also consisted of the Civil Service Tribunal.

The CJEU is located in Luxembourg.

===European Central Bank===

The &quot;European Central Bank&quot; (ECB) is the only one among the 7 institutions that is also an international entity with treaty capability in its own right. It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks which comprises all EU national banks. The bank is governed by a board of national bank governors and a President. It is also the central bank for the eurozone (the states which have adopted the euro) and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability.

The ECB is located in Frankfurt.

The current president is Christine Lagarde.

===European Court of Auditors===
The &quot;European Court of Auditors&quot; (ECA), despite its name, has no judicial powers. It ensures that taxpayer funds from the budget of the European Union have been correctly spent. The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the commission&#x27;s handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.

The Court of Auditors was set up in 1975. It was created as an independent institution due to the sensitivity of the issue of fraud in the Union (the anti-fraud agency, OLAF, is also built on its independence). It is composed of one member from each state appointed by the Council every six years. Every three years one of them is elected as the president of the court, who is currently Klaus-Heiner Lehne.

==Acts and procedures==
There are a number of types of legislation which can be passed. The strongest is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.

The ordinary legislative procedure is used in nearly all policy areas and provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a &quot;common position&quot;. That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve those, then a &quot;Conciliation Committee&quot; is formed. The committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament again by an absolute majority. There are other special procedures used in sensitive areas which reduce the power of Parliament.

==Comparisons==
While the EU&#x27;s system of governance is largely unique, elements can be compared to other models. One general observation on the nature of the distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision-making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are more clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal decision-making.

The EU&#x27;s institutional set up is also somewhat similar to the government of Switzerland (which, although in Europe, is not an EU member state). The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss Federal Council in that both have all-party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion similar to that of the EU&#x27;s Council Presidency. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital.

Furthermore, executive power in the EU is not concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with the division of the European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.

The nature of the European Parliament is better compared with the United States House of Representatives than with the national parliaments of the European Union. This is notable in terms of the committees being of greater size and power, political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch (most national governments operate under a parliamentary system). A difference from all other parliaments is the absence of a Parliamentary legislative initiative. However, given that in most national parliaments initiatives not backed by the executive rarely succeed the value of this difference is in question. Equally, its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments; 80% average and 30% for controversial proposals.

The composition of the council can only be compared with the quite unique and unusual composition of the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments in the same manner as the EU&#x27;s Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments&#x27; agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU&#x27;s Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference of executives in the legislative process.

==Locations==
The institutions are not concentrated in a single capital city; instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities: Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt. The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based in Brussels, the Courts in Luxembourg City, and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of the commission and meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg City, while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its secretariat in Luxembourg City. Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt, while the European Council is based in Brussels (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere).

Brussels&#x27; hosting of institutions has made it a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington, D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament, due to the large number of people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200 million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.

<text>The 2002 European Grand Prix (formally the 2002 Allianz Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held on 23 June 2002 at the Nürburgring, Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It was won by Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, his first win since his victory at the 2000 German Grand Prix. His team mate Michael Schumacher finished second in another dominating performance by the team. McLaren-Mercedes driver Kimi Räikkönen finished third. This was the first race at the modified Nürburgring circuit, as the first chicane was replaced by the &quot;Mercedes Arena&quot; corners.

The victory was Barrichello&#x27;s second of his career and the first of the 2002 season; the result moved him up to fourth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship but was tied with David Coulthard on points. Michael Schumacher extended his lead to be forty-six points ahead of Ralf Schumacher with Montoya a further three points behind. Schumacher tied the all-time held by Alain Prost with his 106th podium finish. Ferrari&#x27;s one-two finish allowed them to draw further ahead of Williams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship and McLaren maintained third position. Renault extended their points advantage over Sauber in the battle for fourth place, with eight races remaining in the season.

==Background==
The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams with two drivers each. The teams, also known as constructors, were Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Sauber, Jordan, BAR, Renault, Jaguar, Arrows, Minardi and Toyota.

Going into the race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 70 points, ahead of Williams teammates Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya who were tied for second place on 27 points. David Coulthard was a close fourth on 26 points, and Rubens Barrichello was fifth on 16 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari were leading with 86 points, ahead of Williams in second on 54 points. McLaren were third with 33 points, while Renault (twelve) and Sauber (eight) battled for fourth place. Ferrari and Michael Schumacher had dominated the championship, with Ralf Schumacher winning the Malaysian Grand Prix and Coulthard won the Monaco Grand Prix. Barrichello and Montoya had finished in second, and Kimi Räikkönen finished in third.

Michael Schumacher had won the previous two European Grands Prix held at the Nürburgring and wanted to concentrate on the potential challenge from the Williams and McLaren teams at the race rather than worry about a possible disqualification from the Austrian Grand Prix where he was given victory after Barrichello was ordered by Ferrari to allow Schumacher past. After retiring from the Canadian Grand Prix with an engine failure which cost him a chance to challenge for victory, Montoya said he had recovered from his disappointment and he was hoping to build on his podium finish from the previous year&#x27;s European Grand Prix. He also said that Williams had addressed his engine problems. Räikkönen was looking forward to racing at the Nürburgring where it was the home race of McLaren&#x27;s engine supplier Mercedes-Benz and was hoping to secure a good finish for the German fans.

After the previous race held at the Nürburgring (the 2001 European Grand Prix) the layout of the circuit was changed, its first major change since it was reopened in 1984. The chicane which previously formed the first corner was replaced by a sharp right-hand hairpin and included a tight left and right-hand corner and the changes were designed to make overtaking opportunities more common. The asphalt was widened by 25 meters to facilitate any overtaking manoeuvres. The changes increased the length of the circuit by 645 yards (590 metres) and the number of laps of the Grand Prix were reduced from 67 to 60. Jaguar team principal and former World Champion Niki Lauda felt the new layout would secure a better view for spectators watching in the grandstands. The new section received mixed reviews from the drivers and critics. Ralf Schumacher said it was &quot;a nice part of the circuit&quot; though he found it difficult to find the ideal braking point and felt overtaking would still be difficult. Jordan driver Takuma Sato noted although the surface was bumpy upon entry he felt being unsighted in the first corner would be &quot;a good feeling&quot;. Retired driver and columnist for &quot;Bild&quot; Hans-Joachim Stuck described it as &quot;sexiest the new corner on the Formula One circuit&quot; and that it was made for aggressive drivers. Coulthard was more vocal in his criticism saying the bumpiness of the section was &quot;ridiculous&quot; and preferred the challenge of the former first corner chicane, while Montoya felt the section was &quot;too slow&quot;.

Some teams made modifications to their cars in preparation for the event. Ferrari brought new electronic bi-directional telemetry and steering wheels and Michael Schumacher evaluated a new engine cover which was not used in the Sunday race. Renault introduced a new aerodynamic package and a traction control system and McLaren brought a new revision of their aerodynamic package. BAR débuted a revised Honda V10 engine specification for the race and Jordan made minor alterations to their front wings.

==Practice==

Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour; the third and fourth sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. The Saturday morning practice and afternoon qualifying sessions began 45 minutes earlier from their usual start times of 09:00 CEST (UTC+2), 10:15 and 14:00 to accommodate the final two quarter-final matches of the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in South Korea and Japan on the same day. Conditions for the Friday practice sessions were warm and overcast. Barrichello set the fastest time of the first practice session with a lap time of 1 minute and 33.665 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than his Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher. Nick Heidfeld (with a time of 1:34.924) was third fastest, ahead of Allan McNish and Felipe Massa. Coulthard, Frentzen, Giancarlo Fisichella, Mika Salo and Montoya rounded out the top ten fastest drivers of the session. Enrique Bernoldi lost the rear-end of his Arrows at the Ford Kurve in the 36th minute of the session and his car&#x27;s right side made light contact with a tyre wall; this required a yellow-flag to be shown as marshals were needed to remove Bernoldi&#x27;s car from the track. In the second practice session, Coulthard was the fastest driver with a time of 1:31.886 despite going off into a gravel trap at Dunlop Kurve; Räikkönen finished with the third quickest time. The Ferrari drivers second and fourth; Michael Schumacher ahead of Barrichello. They were followed by the two Williamses of Montoya (who complained of understeer) and Ralf Schumacher. Jarno Trulli and Jenson Button were seventh and eighth for Renault with Salo and Panis completing the top ten.

It remained warm and overcast for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time of the third session of 1:30.658 which was recorded at the end of the session though he lost control of the rear-end of his Ferrari after clipping a kerb at the Veedol-S chicane early in the session. His teammate Barrichello was second fastest. Ralf Schmacher was third fastest, ahead of his Williams teammate Montoya. Heidfeld secured the fifth fastest time ahead of Räikkönen. Massa, Button, Coulthard and Trulli followed in the top ten. In the final practice session, Michael Schumacher was unable to improve his time but remained fastest; Barrichello finished with the third quickest lap. Heidfeld was running quicker and was fourth, ahead of Ralf Schumacher and Salo. Coulthard, Montoya, Trulli and Button completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. de la Rosa had a hydraulic leak and fire in his car which prevented him from setting a lap time.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The session was held on a dry track with cloudy weather conditions; the track temperature ranged between . Montoya clinched his third consecutive pole position and the seventh of his career with a time of 1:29.906 which was set thirteen minutes before the session ended. He was happy to take the pole position despite having set a target to be on the second row.

Montoya was joined on the front row of the grid by teammate Ralf Schumacher who was 0.009 seconds off Montoya&#x27;s pace and did not change his car&#x27;s set-up. Michael Schumacher qualified in third and his race car was stuck in gear on his first out lap and switched to the spare Ferrari car for the remainder of the session as his mechanics were unable to rectify the gearbox issue. He made two minor mistakes at the final two corners of the circuit on his final run after pushing hard which prevented him from improving his lap time. Barrichello progressively changed his car&#x27;s balance over the one-hour qualifying period and secured fourth. Coulthard changed his set-up to run faster in the circuit&#x27;s middle section which compromised performance in the first sector but took fifth. Räikkönen dropped one of his wheels on the turn thirteen kerbs which restricted him to sixth. The two Renault drivers filled the fourth row of the grid with Trulli ahead of Button. Trulli was happy with his starting position although Button had understeer from his second qualifying run and made a minor change to his rear anti roll-bar in an attempt to go quicker but was delayed by slower cars. Heidfeld felt vibrations after flat-spotting his front-right tyre on his first run which restricted him to ninth. Salo rounded out the top ten qualifiers and reported his car handled best on his first run but it deteriorated afterwards.

Massa improved the balance on his Sauber but had excessive oversteer through turns two and four and managed eleventh. Panis took twelfth. He was ahead of McNish in the slower of the two Toyotas and his car developed intermittent issues with his electronics. Sato in the faster Jordan followed in 14th place and was disappointed with his performance as he struggled with an excessive amount of oversteer throughout qualifying. He was followed in the time sheets by Frentzen who was suffering from understeer which caused him to lose time in the circuit&#x27;s first sector. de la Rosa drove the spare Jaguar monocoque for two laps and did two further laps in his repaired race car; he said his race car felt better balance but was delayed on his final run which restricted him to 16th. Irvine said he picked up understeer in the one-hour session and had difficulty of accelerating out of corners; these issues meant he could only take 17th. He was in front of Fisichella in the slower Jordan. Villeneuve managed 19th and was unable to find a suitable car set-up and his car had become slower. The two Minardi drivers qualified in the 20th and 22nd positions with Mark Webber quicker than Alex Yoong; they were separated by Bernoldi who had balance problems.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 09:30 local time for a 30-minute warm-up session, in overcast weather conditions. Barrichello maintained his form by setting the fastest lap in the closing moments of the session, with a lap of 1:32.671, three-tenths of a second faster than teammate Michael Schumacher who traded the fastest time with Barrichello during the session. Coulthard was third fastest and Räikkönen rounded out the top four; both drivers were more than one second off Barrichello&#x27;s pace.

==Race==
The race started at 14:00 local time. The conditions on the grid were overcast before the race; the track temperature ranged between and rain was forecast. When the race started, Montoya and Ralf Schumacher drew alongside each other heading into the first corner, with Ralf Schumacher passing Montoya for the lead by taking the outside line. Coulthard, who started fifth, made a quick getaway but slid wide allowing Barrichello and Michael Schumacher to reclaim their starting positions. Both Jordan drivers collided with Fisichella spinning into Sato at the first corner; the pair dropped to the rear-end of the field and both made pit stops for repairs at the end of the first lap. Michael Schumacher got ahead of Montoya for third on the same lap but Montoya momentarily reclaimed the position, while Barrichello overtook Ralf Schumacher for the lead on the straight heading into turn eight. Michael Schumacher eventually moved ahead of Montoya by the end of lap one. At the end of the first lap, Barrichello led Ralf Schumacher by one second, with Michael Schumacher a further two seconds behind in third. Montoya in fourth was followed by Coulthard, Räikkönen, Button, Trulli, Massa and Heidfeld.

Barrichello started to pull away from Ralf Schumacher who was being caught by Michael Schumacher. Elsewhere in the field, Bernoldi moved ahead of Irvine for 14th position and Villeneuve overtook Yoong and de la Rosa to move into 18th. Michael Schumacher moved into second place after he passed Ralf Schumacher at the RTL Kurve on the third lap and began to close the gap to Barrichello. Panis moved ahead of Salo for twelfth and Villeneuve overtook Webber for 17th. Villeneuve ran wide during the course of lap four but retained his 17th position. Trulli ran deep into turn one and fell down from eighth to twelfth place on the following lap, while Barrichello and Michael Schumacher continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher. Trulli regained eleventh position after passing Panis on lap six while Salo in 13th spun and lost six positions. Webber made mistake and ran wide on lap seven and dropped behind de la Rosa and Salo to 19th position, while Yoong took a drive-through penalty because he jumped the start. By lap eight, Michael Schumacher was catching teammate Barrichello and was 1.4 seconds behind the Brazilian driver, and was right behind him by the tenth lap. Trulli had moved back up into ninth on the same lap after overtaking McNish and Heidfeld, while Bernoldi was passed by Frentzen for 13th place.

Fisichella&#x27;s Jordan lost parts of its bodywork as he drove down the main straight on lap eleven having bounced heavily on the kerbs and grass lining the circuit earlier in the race. On the same lap, de la Rosa passed Irvine for 16th. Bernoldi lost 14th position after he was overtaken by Villeneuve on the 13th lap, while Frentzen ran off the circuit and was passed by Villeneuve and Bernoldi; the latter also drove off the circuit on the following lap. Räikkonen ran wide at the Yokohama-S and struggled to drive his car from the outside of the track allowing Button to take advantage to move into sixth on lap 17. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different strategies – the Ferrari team were planning a two-stop strategy whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 24 and exited in front of Ralf Schumacher. Ferrari also relied on team orders and told Michael Schumacher to remain behind Barrichello, and achieved a 1–2 finish.

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated square pyramid is the Johnson solid that can be constructed by attaching an equilateral square pyramid to a square antiprism. It occurs in chemistry; for example, the square antiprismatic molecular geometry.

== Construction ==
The gyroelongated square pyramid is composite, since it can constructed by attaching one equilateral square pyramid to the square antiprism, a process known as the gyroelongation. This construction involves the covering of one of two square faces and replacing them with the four equilateral triangles, so that the resulting polyhedron has twelve equilateral triangles and one square. The convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular is the Johnson solid, and the gyroelongated square pyramid is one of them, enumerated as formula_1, the tenth Johnson solid.

== Properties ==
The surface area of a gyroelongated square pyramid with edge length formula_2 is:
formula_3
the area of twelve equilateral triangles and a square. Its volume:
formula_4
can be obtained by slicing the square pyramid and the square antiprism, after which adding their volumes.

It has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the square pyramid, the cyclic group formula_5 of order eight. Its dihedral angle can be derived by calculating the angle of a square pyramid and square antiprism in the following:
* the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between two adjacent triangles, approximately formula_6
* the dihedral angle of a square antiprism between two adjacent triangles, approximately formula_7, and between a triangle to its base is formula_8
* the dihedral angle between two adjacent triangles, on the edge where an equilateral square pyramid is attached to a square antiprism, is formula_9, for which by adding the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between its base and its lateral face formula_10 and the dihedral angle of a square antiprism between two adjacent triangles.

== Applications ==
In stereochemistry, the capped square antiprismatic molecular geometry can be described as the atom cluster of the gyroelongated square pyramid. An example is , a lanthanum(III) complex with a La–La bond.

<text>The 2002 British Grand Prix (formally the LV Foster&#x27;s British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire, England on 7 July 2002. The 60-lap race was the tenth race of the 2002 Formula One season and was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, with team-mate Rubens Barrichello second and Juan Pablo Montoya third in a Williams-BMW.

==Qualifying==
Qualifying saw Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya edge out the two Ferraris to take his fourth consecutive pole position, beating Rubens Barrichello by 0.034 seconds and Michael Schumacher by 0.044. Ralf Schumacher was fourth in the other Williams, three-tenths of a second behind his brother but eight-tenths ahead of Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s McLaren in fifth. The top ten was completed by David Coulthard in the other McLaren, Jarno Trulli in the Renault, Mika Salo in the Toyota, Jacques Villeneuve in the BAR and Nick Heidfeld in the Sauber. Alex Yoong failed to set a lap within the 107% time in his Minardi and thus did not qualify.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
There were dark clouds overhead at the beginning of the race. On the formation lap, Barrichello stalled and was put to the back of the grid. Then, when the starting lights went out, Allan McNish in the second Toyota retired immediately with a clutch failure. In the early laps, Montoya led from Michael Schumacher, with Räikkönen overtaking Ralf for third and Barrichello charging through the field, reaching eighth by lap 6.

As the rain started to fall, the drivers made their first pit stops. Bridgestone teams changed from slick tyres to intermediates, but Michelin teams did not have that option as they had spent no time developing their own Intermediate solution throughout the season, thus forcing the affected teams to change from slicks straight to full wets, neither of which were ideal for the conditions.

Michael Schumacher and the Williams drivers all pitted on lap 13, but Ralf&#x27;s stop went wrong as the Williams crew did not have his tyres ready. Coulthard briefly inherited the lead, but the McLaren team had gambled by leaving him out longer than the other leaders, bringing him in on lap 15. On lap 16, Michael Schumacher passed Montoya for the lead, and on lap 19 Barrichello completed his charge by passing the Colombian for second.

With the Bridgestone tyres better suited to the conditions than the Michelins, the Ferraris began to pull away. Meanwhile, Coulthard was struggling in ninth, McLaren&#x27;s gamble having backfired. As the weather appeared to improve, the team brought him and fourth-placed Räikkönen in to change back to slicks. This too did not pay off, as the rain in fact got heavier, and after changing back to wets again, the McLarens toiled at the back of the field, leading Coulthard to experiment with Michelin&#x27;s underdeveloped Intermediates for a small stint, but confirming they were not any more competitive than the wets. Coulthard eventually finished two laps behind Schumacher while Räikkönen retired on lap 45 with an engine failure.

The tyre issue also affected the Renaults, Trulli and Jenson Button running in the points before making three stops apiece. Trulli dropped out on lap 30 with an electrical problem, before Button suffered a suspension failure on lap 55.

Up at the front, Schumacher led Barrichello by 13 seconds at half-distance. By this point, the Ferraris were so far ahead that Barrichello retained an advantage of over half a minute over third-placed Montoya following a spin on lap 33. By making one fewer stop, Montoya managed to catch up with the Brazilian and overtake him on lap 41, but Barrichello repassed him five laps later and pulled away again. Ralf Schumacher benefitted from the misfortunes of the McLarens and the Renaults to regain fourth, only to have another pit stop go wrong when his fuel rig failed. This left four more Bridgestone drivers – Villeneuve, Heidfeld, Olivier Panis in the second BAR and Giancarlo Fisichella in the Jordan – occupying fourth to seventh.

Michael Schumacher eventually took the chequered flag 14.5 seconds ahead of Barrichello, with Montoya a further 17 seconds back and the last man on the lead lap. Villeneuve and Panis took fourth and fifth, securing BAR&#x27;s first points of the season, while Heidfeld held off Fisichella for the final point.

This was Schumacher&#x27;s seventh victory of the season and his 60th in all, and it extended his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 54 points – meaning that he could secure his fifth title at the next race, in France, with six races still to run. Schumacher set the record for most podium finishes with his 107th. Barrichello moved into second in the standings, one point ahead of Montoya and two ahead of Ralf Schumacher.

<text>The 2002 French Grand Prix (formally the LXXXVIII Mobil 1 Grand Prix de France) was a Formula One motor race held at Magny-Cours on 21 July 2002. It was the eleventh race of the 2002 Formula One World Championship, last race on the original layout and the race in which Michael Schumacher secured his fifth World Drivers&#x27; Championship title, equalling Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s record set over 40 years before. McLaren-Mercedes drivers Kimi Räikkönen and David Coulthard finished second and third respectively.

In a peculiar qualifying session, a heavy crash prevented Giancarlo Fisichella from qualifying for the race on medical grounds, whilst the cash-strapped Arrows, unable to reach an agreement with their sponsors, made a brief appearance in qualifying, only to have both their drivers deliberately set lap times slow enough for them to not qualify for the race.

<text>The 2002 German Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland 2002) was a Formula One motor race held on 28 July 2002 at Hockenheimring, Hockenheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It was the twelfth round of the 2002 Formula One season and the 64th German Grand Prix. The 67-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from pole position. Juan Pablo Montoya finished second in a Williams with his teammate Ralf Schumacher third.

It was the first Grand Prix to be held at Hockenheimring since the track was redesigned, which had seen the forest sections of the track removed and hence the length of the track shortened.

== Qualifying ==
Michael Schumacher qualified on pole position in his Ferrari, setting a time of 1:14.389. Alex Yoong did not qualify for the race due to the 107% rule. Both Arrows A23 cars driven by Heinz-Herald Frentzen and Enrique Bernoldi who deliberately failed to qualify for previous round -the French Grand Prix- did qualify for this event in what would ultimately be the last GP weekend for Arrows F1.

===Qualifying classification===
== Race ==
Michael Schumacher won the race, with Juan Pablo Montoya in second, and Ralf Schumacher, Montoya&#x27;s Williams team-mate, in third. Both Arrows cars retired from the race with mechanical problems, and it would prove to be the last race the team would compete in. Financial difficulties resulted in the team missing the remainder of the season, before going into liquidation at the end of the year. Enrique Bernoldi would not race in a Formula One Grand Prix again.

<text>The 2002 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 1 September 2002. It was the fourteenth race of the 2002 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari. Schumacher took pole position, led the whole race except during the pit stops, and set the fastest race lap. With the win, he became the first driver to win ten Formula One Grands Prix in a single season, surpassing the record jointly held by himself and Nigel Mansell. Team-mate Rubens Barrichello finished second, with Juan Pablo Montoya third in a Williams-BMW. The Arrows team were present in the paddock but did not participate in any session during the weekend; this was their final appearance at a Grand Prix event. 

Two months after the race, it was announced that the Belgian Grand Prix would not be held in due to a row over tobacco advertising. Spa would return to the F1 calendar in , however, when the Bus Stop chicane was modified significantly.

<text>The 2002 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Gran Premio Vodafone d&#x27;Italia 2002) was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 15 September 2002. It was the fifteenth race of the 2002 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by Rubens Barrichello, driving a Ferrari. Teammate Michael Schumacher finished second, 0.25 seconds behind, to complete a Ferrari 1–2 on the team&#x27;s home soil. Eddie Irvine finished third in a Jaguar-Cosworth, achieving both his and the Jaguar team&#x27;s last F1 podium finish. It was also the only time in 2002 where a driver from outside the top three teams in the constructors&#x27; championship finished on the podium.

==Background==
Heading into the Italian Grand Prix, both the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships were already settled, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having claimed the Drivers&#x27; Championship four races earlier in France, and Ferrari securing the Constructors&#x27; Championship two races later in Hungary.

After the Belgian Grand Prix on 1 September, all teams (except Arrows) conducted mid-season testing at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza between 3–6 September to prepare for the upcoming race at the circuit. Michael Schumacher was fastest on the first day, ahead of BAR test driver Anthony Davidson which was held in wet weather conditions, with intermittent dry spells. Ralf Schumacher set the fastest times on the second where the rain continued into the morning before stopping meaning the track dried up as the session progressed. The first full day of dry weather conditions was held on the third day where Pedro de la Rosa was the fastest driver. Rubens Barrichello was the fastest driver on the final day of testing. Juan Pablo Montoya caused a red flag to be shown when he lost control of his car at the Lesmo corners, and removed his front wing after colliding with the barrier.

Due to the configuration of the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, with its high average speed, the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Ferrari introduced a new qualifying-specification engine but the team installed a previous engine specification for the race on Sunday. Williams and BAR introduced revised engine specifications for the qualifying session, while Renault debuted new front wings for the race.

==Practice==
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour; the third and fourth sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. Conditions were sunny and dry for the Friday practice sessions.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. The Williams and Ferrari teams chose to experiment with tyre set-ups by using hard compound tyres with the aim of gaining better race performance. Montoya eclipsed the fastest lap speed recorded in Formula One (, set by Keke Rosberg at the 1985 British Grand Prix) to clinch his seventh pole position of the season with a time of one minute and 20.264 seconds and a speed of . His record would remain unbroken until 2018, when Kimi Räikkönen set a faster pole lap. He felt his lap time was &quot;pretty good&quot; and gained a large amount of time at the Lesmo corners which contributed to a fast middle sector time. Montoya was joined on the front row of the grid by Michael Schumacher who was 0.257 seconds off Montoya&#x27;s pace and was happy with his lap time despite him taking time to get optimum tyre temperature. Ralf Schumacher qualified third and reported making a mistake at the Lesmo corners on his third timed run. Barrichello set his fastest lap time on his second timed run to secure fourth position. Räikkonen initially secured fifth in his McLaren but was stripped of his fastest qualifying lap as a result of a collision with Sato&#x27;s Jordan at the Roggia chicane, which caused the session to be stopped temporarily; as a result, Irvine in the Jaguar was promoted to fifth with Räikkonen sixth. Coulthard took seventh in the other McLaren, with de la Rosa alongside him on the fourth row in the second Jaguar. Villeneuve took ninth in the BAR, with Salo rounding out the top ten in his Toyota.

Trulli was eleventh in the Renault, joined on the sixth row by Fisichella in the other Jordan. McNish was thirteenth in the second Toyota, followed by the two Saubers of Massa and Heidfeld. Panis was sixteenth in the second BAR, with Button seventeenth in the second Renault. Despite the incident with Räikkonen, Sato took eighteenth and said &quot;That was the most difficult qualifying session of my career&quot;. The two Minardis lined up on the back row of the grid, Webber ahead of the returning Yoong.

===Qualifying classification===
 – Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s fastest time (1:21.163) was cancelled following a collision with Takuma Sato during qualifying, this dropped him one place from fifth to sixth.

==Race==
The race started at 14:00 local time. The weather conditions on the grid were dry and sunny before the race; the track temperature ranged between . Ralf Schumacher switched to the spare Williams because his regular car developed a fuel pressure problem. At the start, Montoya drove to the right to block Michael Schumacher, allowing teammate Ralf Schumacher to run alongside him heading into the Rettifilo chicane. Montoya ran wide to prevent a collision with Ralf, who drove over the chicane and thus took the lead illegally. Williams contacted FIA race director Charlie Whiting who replied that Ralf was required to cede the lead back to Montoya. McNish made the best start in the field, moving from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Panis made up four positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, the order of the top ten drivers was Ralf Schumacher, Montoya, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, Räikkönen, Irvine, McNish, Salo, Panis and Villeneuve.

Ralf Schumacher began to pull away from Montoya. Further down the field, Villeneuve got ahead of Heidfeld to take over tenth, while Button passed Massa to move into thirteenth position and Yoong overtook teammate Webber for eighteenth. Ralf Schumacher set a new fastest lap, a 1:26.230 on lap three, but was later eclipsed by Barrichello. Villeneuve was overtaken by Trulli on the same lap and Webber reclaimed eighteenth from Yoong. Williams received a reply to order Ralf Schumacher to cede first position to Montoya which was relayed to Schumacher by the Senior Operations Engineer of Williams Sam Michael at the end of lap four. Afterwards, Ralf Schumacher pulled over to the side of the track at the Rettifilo with smoke billowing from his engine and became the first retirement of the race at the start of lap five. His teammate Montoya thus temporarily inherited the lead but was blinded by the smoke, allowing Barrichello to move into the inside line, and after running in Montoya&#x27;s slipstream, he passed the Williams driver for the lead under braking going into the Rettifilo. On lap fifteen, Felipe Massa and Pedro de la Rosa collided at the Ascari chicane. In accordance with the new regulations that season, Massa became the first driver to receive a 10-place grid penalty for causing a collision. Kimi Räikkönen retired during the 30th lap due to engine failure, for the fifth time of the season.

Felipe Massa became the first driver to wear the HANS device during a Formula One race.

<doc id="1123482" wikidata="Q740564" url="?curid=1123482" title="Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)">
<text>The Assembly of the Republic (, ), commonly referred to as simply Parliament (), is the unicameral parliament of Portugal. According to the Constitution of Portugal, the parliament &quot;is the representative assembly of all Portuguese citizens&quot;. The constitution names the assembly as one of the country&#x27;s organs of supreme authority.

It meets in São Bento Palace, the historical site of an old Benedictine monastery. The palace has been the seat of the Portuguese parliaments since 1834 (Cortes until 1910, Congress from 1911 to 1926 and National Assembly from 1933 to 1974).

==Powers and duties of the Assembly==
The Assembly of the Republic&#x27;s powers derive from its ability to dismiss a government through a vote of no confidence, to change the country&#x27;s laws, and to amend the constitution (which requires a majority of two-thirds). In addition to these key powers, the constitution grants to the Assembly extensive legislative powers and substantial control over the budget, the right to authorize the government to raise taxes and grant loans, the power to ratify treaties and other kinds of international agreements, and the duty to approve or reject decisions by the President of the Republic to declare war and make peace. The assembly also appoints many members of important state institutions, such as ten of the thirteen members of the Constitutional Court and seven of the sixteen members of the Council of State.

The constitution requires the assembly to quickly review and approve an incoming government&#x27;s program. Parliamentary rules allow the assembly to call for committees of inquiry to examine the government&#x27;s actions. Political opposition represented in the assembly has the power to review the cabinet&#x27;s actions, even though it is unlikely that the actions can be reversed. Party groups can also call for interpellations that require debates about specific government policies.

==Structure==
The assembly has 230 MPs. It originally consisted of 250 MPs, but the constitutional reforms of 1989 reduced its number to between 180 and 230. Members are elected by popular vote for legislative terms of four years from the country&#x27;s twenty-two constituencies. There are eighteen in mainland Portugal corresponding to each district, one each for the autonomous regions of Azores (Portuguese: Açores) and Madeira, and two for Portuguese people living abroad (one covering Europe and one covering the rest of the world). Except for the constituencies for Portuguese living abroad, which are fixed at two representatives each, the number of MPs is determined by the number of voters registered in a constituency, using the D&#x27;Hondt method of proportional representation. Constituencies vary greatly in size; from as large as the district of Lisbon, which returns 48 representatives, to as small as the district of Portalegre, which elects just two.

For the 2024 legislative elections, the MPs were distributed by districts as follows:
According to the constitution, members of the assembly represent the entire country, not the constituency from which they are elected. This directive has been reinforced in practice by the strong role of political parties in regard to members of the assembly. Party leadership, for example, determines in which areas candidates are to run for office, thus often weakening members&#x27; ties to their constituencies. Moreover, members of the assembly are expected to vote with their party and to work within parliamentary groups based on party membership. Party discipline is strong, and insubordinate members can be coerced through a variety of means. A further obstacle to members&#x27; independence is that their bills first have to be submitted to the parliamentary groups, and it is these groups&#x27; leaders who set the assembly&#x27;s agenda.

The President of the Assembly of the Republic is the second hierarchical figure in the Portuguese state, after the President of the Portuguese Republic, and is elected by secret vote of the members of parliament. The President of the Assembly is aided by four vice presidents, nominated by the other parties represented in the parliament, and is usually the speaker. When they are not present, one of the vice presidents takes the role of speaker. When the President of the Republic is, for any reason, unable to perform the job, the President of the Assembly of the Republic becomes the substitute.

<doc id="1123484" wikidata="Q1129593" url="?curid=1123484" title="Cook Partisan Voting Index">
<text>The Cook Partisan Voting Index, abbreviated PVI or CPVI, is a measurement of how partisan a U.S. congressional district or U.S. state is. This partisanship is indicated as lean towards either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, compared to the nation as a whole, based on how that district or state voted in the previous two presidential elections.

==History==
The Partisan Voting Index was developed in 1997 by Charlie Cook of &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot;, in conjunction with Clark Bensen and his political statistical analysis firm, Polidata, &quot;as a means of providing a more accurate picture of the competitiveness&quot;. It is based on the methodology introduced by Rob Richie of the Center for Voting and Democracy for the Center&#x27;s July 1997 Monopoly Politics report.

The Cook Political Report has since released new PVI scores every two years. In 2021, the newsletter ended its relationship with Polidata and instead used Dave Leip&#x27;s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections to calculate 2020&#x27;s results. The most recent iteration is the 2022 Cook Partisan Voting Index, which was released with an updated formula for calculating PVI values.

==Calculation and format==
The index looks at how every congressional district voted in the past two presidential elections combined and compares it to the national average. The Cook PVI is displayed as a letter, a plus sign, and a number, with the letter (either a D for Democratic or an R for Republican) indicating the party that outperformed in the district and the number showing how many percentage points above the national average it received. In 2022, the formula was updated to weigh the most recent presidential election more heavily than the prior election.

==By congressional district==
The PVIs for congressional districts are calculated based on the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. With a PVI of R+1, was determined to be the median congressional district, meaning that exactly 217 districts are more Democratic and 217 are more Republican than this district. , there are 222 districts in the House that are more Republican than the national average and 206 districts more Democratic than the national average. The number of swing seats, defined as those between D+5 and R+5, is 87.


==By state==
The PVIs for states are calculated based on the results of the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. The table below reflects the state of Congress and governors, based on the 2024 election results.

<text>Composition B (Comp B), also known as Hexotol and Hexolite (among others), is a high explosive consisting of castable mixtures of RDX and TNT. It is used as the main explosive filling in artillery projectiles, rockets, land mines, hand grenades, and various other munitions. It was also used for the explosive lenses in the first implosion-type nuclear weapons developed by the United States.

The standard proportions of ingredients (by weight) are 59.5% RDX (detonation velocity of 8,750 m/s) and 39.5% TNT (detonation velocity of 6,900 m/s), phlegmatized with 1% paraffin wax. Most commonly it is described as 60/40 RDX/TNT with 1% wax added.

== Properties ==
* Density: 1.65 g/cm3
* Velocity of detonation: 8,050 m/s

== Use ==
Composition B was extremely common in Western nations&#x27; munitions and was the standard explosive filler from early World War II until the early 1950s, when less sensitive explosives such as Composition H6 began to replace it in many weapons. M65 bombs from 1953 containing degraded Composition B were responsible for much of the damage in the 1967 USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; fire.

Some NATO-approved munitions suppliers such as Mecar have continued to use Composition B in their products.

Composition B is related to Cyclotol, which has a higher proportion of RDX (up to 75%).

IMX-101 is slowly replacing Comp B in US military artillery shells, and IMX-104 in mortar rounds and hand grenades.

<text>The 2002 United States Grand Prix (formally the 2002 SAP United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 September 2002, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, in front of about 125,000 spectators. It was the 16th and penultimate round of the 2002 Formula One World Championship and the third United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis. Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello won the 73-lap race after starting second. His teammate Michael Schumacher finished second and McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard was third.

Michael Schumacher, the World Drivers&#x27; Champion, started from pole position after setting the fastest qualifying lap. Barrichello started second alongside his teammate, with Coulthard starting third. The first three drivers maintained their positions into the first corner Michael Schumacher led the race for most of the race, only ceding it to Barrichello during both pit stop cycles. On the final lap, Michael Schumacher led Barrichello by half a second before allowing his teammate to catch up to him through the final corner and draw alongside him. Barrichello won by 0.011 seconds over Michael Schumacher, his fourth victory of the season and fifth of his career.

The race result secured Barrichello second in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, with Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya in third position. Montoya had moved three more points clear of fourth-placed teammate Ralf Schumacher With one race left in the season, Williams secured second position from McLaren in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, while Ferrari broke McLaren&#x27;s 1988 record for the most constructors&#x27; points scored in a season.

==Background ==

The 2002 United States Grand Prix was the penultimate round of the 2002 Formula One World Championship, held on 29 September 2002, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) road course in Speedway, Indiana. It was the third United States Grand Prix hosted at Indianapolis since it was reinstated on the Formula One World Championship calendar in 2000 following a nine-year absence. The Porsche Supercup and the Ferrari Challenge held support races during the weekend. Participating in the Ferrari Challenge, Mandy Williams Reimert was the only woman to race in any of the events that weekend, and consequently, the first woman to race on the speedway&#x27;s infield road course – which had been inaugurated in 2000.

Before the race, both the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and World Constructors&#x27; Championship were already won, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having secured the World Drivers&#x27; Championship five rounds earlier at the and Ferrari took the World Constructors&#x27; Championship two races after that at the , with Williams too many points behind to be able to catch them. Rubens Barrichello had to score three points in the race to secure second in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Following the on 15 September, several teams tested their cars at European circuits to prepare for the race at Indianapolis. The Williams and McLaren teams tested for four days at the Circuit de Catalunya in Spain before being joined for three of those days by British American Racing (BAR) and Jaguar. McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz led the first and second days, regular driver David Coulthard the third day, and BAR&#x27;s Oliver Panis the final day. Renault and Sauber tested at the Silverstone Circuit in Britain for three days and Jordan two of those days. Sauber led all three days through Felipe Massa (day one), Nick Heidfeld (day two), and Heinz-Harald Frentzen (day three). Ferrari did four days of tyre and electronics testing at the Mugello Circuit in Italy, joined by Minardi on the second day. Ferrari test driver Luciano Burti drove three F2002 cars at the Fiorano Circuit on 19 September.

The IMS asphalt pavement was diamond grounded to smooth out several bumps and improve grip for racing vehicles to prevent bottoming out. A pit wall was installed to isolate the circuit from the pit lane entry. The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) agreed to keep turn 13&#x27;s energy-absorbing Steel And Foam Energy Reduction (SAFER) barrier, which had been installed in all four turns prior to the 2002 Indianapolis 500 that May. Turn 13&#x27;s barrier was expanded to accommodate racing cars travelling clockwise. Part of turn one&#x27;s kerb was removed to make its opening slightly wider prior to Saturday&#x27;s two practice sessions.

Ten constructors entered two drivers each for the event. Sauber team principal Peter Sauber signed Frentzen to replace Massa for the Grand Prix so that Massa could avoid serving a ten-place grid penalty from his final starting position imposed by the stewards for an avoidable accident with Jaguar&#x27;s Pedro de la Rosa at the preceding ; the penalty was imposed on the driver, not the team. Renault&#x27;s Jenson Button was cleared to race. During testing, he experienced dizzy spells caused by an inner ear infection that affected his balance. Arrows did not enter the race, their third in succession in 2002, because the team continued to be affected by financial trouble.

All teams brought developments for their 2003 cars to Indianapolis. McLaren introduced a new front suspension with the strut attached directly to the hub carrier rather than the lower triangle. BAR supplied lighter-weight Brembo brake calipers than the standard model. Honda provided a new advanced qualifying engine to BAR and Jordan. Toyota debuted a new front aerodynamic layout with smaller aerodynamic profiles behind the front wheels than prior models and two aerodynamic appendages parallel to the bottom in front of the side entrance. The team reverted to the previous configuration for the race.

==Practice==

Two one-hour practices on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday preceded the race. Heavy rain fell on the IMS overnight, but it quickly subsided and ceased an hour before the first practice session began When the tyre rubber was removed from the circuit, it became more abrasive than expected. The circuit was slightly moist in the first session with a puddle at turn nine but had dried fully (except the grass) by the second. Michael Schumacher lapped fastest almost halfway through the first session with a time of 1:15.188. Giancarlo Fisichella (Jordan), the Jaguar duo of De La Rosa and Eddie Irvine, Juan Pablo Montoya (Williams), Takuma Sato (Jordan), Heidfeld, Button and McLaren teammates Kimi Räikkönen and Coulthard completed the top ten.

Barrichello lost control of his Ferrari on the grass at the entry of the banked turn 13 owing to a loss of pressure in the left rear tyre after 29 minutes. He went up, causing moderate damage to his car&#x27;s left side striking a concrete wall sideways around way from the SAFER barrier. The left-rear wheel and front wing were removed, while the left-front wheel was disconnected but held in place by wheel tethers. Barrichello sustained bruising but exited his car that was in the circuit&#x27;s centre unaided. Officials stopped practice for 18 minutes, because marshals had to clear debris and remove his Ferrari from the centre of the circuit. He missed the rest of Friday&#x27;s running because FIA rules prohibited him from driving the spare Ferrari. Ralf Schumacher lost control of his Williams car with ten minutes remaining and spun into the turn eight outside tyre wall, seeing the rear wing partly dislodged.

Lap times were faster in the second practice session because of the drying track, and several drivers made errors. Michael Schumacher set the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:13.548 with 17 minutes remaining. Irvine was almost six-tenths of a second slower in second. The two McLarens of Coulthard and Räikkönen, BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve, Frentzen, Fisichella, Renault&#x27;s Jarno Trulli, Heidfeld and Ralf Schumacher made up positions three to ten. Six minutes into the session, Sato locked the wheels on the wet grass and spun off the track, colliding into the turn eight tyre barrier. Montoya stopped on track with a suspected engine problem and Button was asked to stop because Renault detected over two-way telemetry a possible oil gearbox issue.

The third practice session was held under thick fog and cool, cloudy weather. Michael Schumacher maintained his overall lead, with a lap time of 1:11.262 19 minutes into the session. He was almost half a second faster than teammate Barrichello in second. Coulthard, Montoya, Räikkönen, Ralf Schumacher, Irvine, Trulli and Toyota&#x27;s Mika Salo followed in the top ten. Sato&#x27;s engine failed while driving at low speed after one minute of the session, and he pulled off to the side of the track with smoke billowing from the back of his car, which later caught fire. Jordan switched the engine from its backup car to Sato&#x27;s race car.

The fog that had descended on IMS had dissipated significantly before the sun broke through as teams completed their qualifying preparations during the final practice session. Michael Schumacher accomplished a sweep of being the quickest driver in every practice session with a lap of 1:11.158 set seven minutes before practice ended. His teammate Barrichello, Irvine, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, Heidfeld, Montoya, Räikkönen, Fisichella and Frentzen rounded out the top ten. Räikkönen spun his McLaren, breaking its front suspension hitting the tyre barrier between turns nine and ten just before practice ended. His race car was required during qualifying.

== Qualifying ==

Each driver was allowed twelve laps during Saturday&#x27;s one-hour qualifying session, with starting positions determined by the drivers&#x27; quickest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the quickest lap time in order to qualify for the race. Qualifying was held in sunny and warm weather, and track conditions improved, resulting in a 20-minute wait for participants to drive on a good circuit. Michael Schumacher won his sixth pole position of the season and 49th of his career after setting a new track lap record of 1:10.790 on his second quick lap. He aborted his first quick lap after locking his tyres and going onto grass, and believed he could have gone faster had he not had to slow for yellow flags for Alex Yoong&#x27;s abandoned Minardi car. Schumacher was joined on the front row by teammate Barrichello, who was nearly 0.3 seconds slower after struggling to get his Ferrari properly balanced and making a mistake at turn one on his first run. Coulthard took third from Montoya on his final lap, losing time being late accelerate out of turn 13. Williams teammates Montoya and Ralf Schumacher were fourth and fifth, respectively, owing to car balance issues. Montoya&#x27;s two errors kept him from lapping faster, while Ralf Schumacher understeered. Räikkönen, sixth, drove the spare McLaren following his crash during practice but had to slow for yellow flags. BAR altered Villeneuve&#x27;s car on each of his runs, and he took seventh. Trulli, eighth, worked with Renault&#x27;s engineers to correct his car&#x27;s balance. Fisichella, ninth, could not extract the maximum performance from his car. Heidfeld locked his brakes on his first run and spun after losing control of his car when braking on the second. He changed his chassis setup again for tenth.

Heidfeld&#x27;s teammate Frentzen was the fastest driver who did not qualify in the top 10, finishing 11th after Sauber fixed most of the oversteering issues with his car. Panis, 12th, oversteered heavily on his first run, was blocked by Coulthard on his third run, and spun with five minutes left on his final run. Irvine abandoned his first quick lap after losing grip in a difficult-to-handle Jaguar braking for turn one. Further setup tweaks and a new set of tyres failed to improve his performance, leaving him 13th. Button, 14th, reported that his car&#x27;s balance was inconsistent, yawning from understeer to oversteer near the end of the lap. Sato qualified 15th after being made to use a lower-specification Honda engine. Allan McNish, 16th, qualified higher than Toyota teammate Salo for the second time in 2002, having been affected by understeer. De La Rosa had the identical car setup as Irvine and qualified 17th because his Jaguar was loose under braking and steering. Minardi&#x27;s Mark Webber recovered from a gearbox input shaft failure in the final practice session that required a gearbox and engine change to qualify 18th. On his final run, Salo in 19th had full loss of car grip and the wheel speed sensor failed. Yoong damaged his car&#x27;s left side hitting the turn eight barrier after driving onto wet grass but returned to the circuit. He could not lap quicker in the spare Minardi car and finished 20th and last.

===Qualifying classification===
== Warm-up ==
A 30-minute warm-up session took place in sunny weather on the morning of the race. At the start of the session, participants did initial installation laps in their spare and race vehicles. Michael Schumacher lapped fastest at 1:13.183 seven minutes before warm-up ended. Barrichello, Panis, Sato, Räikkönen, Salo, Irvine, Coulthard, Button and Fisichella were in positions two through ten. Coulthard&#x27;s race vehicle experienced a slight fuel leak, so he swapped to the spare McLaren setup for teammate Räikkönen during warm-up, and the mechanics altered the car to suit him. Button and Fisichella each stalled their engines attempting launch control starts at the pit lane exit.

== Race ==
The 73-lap, race began before an estimated 125,000 spectators at 13:00 local time. Before the race, the weather was sunny, with the air temperature at and the track temperature at . The press expected that 120,000 to 150,000 people would attend, with most coming from the United States; the decreased turnout was attributed to factors such as both titles being won by Ferrari and the state of the global economy. Prior to the start, drivers starting on the outside grid places were dissatisfied since the racing line ensured the inside was cleaner. Michael Schumacher overshot his pole position grid spot, but he reversed back into position. When the red lights went out to begin the race, Michael Schumacher held his lead into the first corner. Behind him, Barrichello, wearing a corset under his racing overalls, held off Coulhtard&#x27;s challenge on the outside for second by moving towards him to prevent him from getting a run. Ralf Schumacher passed his slow-starting teammate Montoya for third place after a better start. Salo made the best start in the field, moving from 19th to 16th by the end of the first lap, while Panis lost five positions over the same distance.

At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led his teammate Barrichello by 0.9 seconds, with Coulthard in third. Montoya was slipstreaming teammate Ralf Schumacher as they exited the banked turn 13 and drew alongside him on the main straight. On the outside, Montoya attempted to brake later than Ralf Schumacher, only for his teammate to lose control of his vehicle&#x27;s rear during braking after striking the inside kerb while the former entered the corner on an wider outside radius and was able to drive through at the same speed. As Montoya passed, Ralf Schumacher was on a tighter trajectory and locked his brakes and collided with his right rear wheel, sending both cars onto the grass and Montoya&#x27;s car bounced. Because of the collision, Montoya fell to seventh place. Ralf&#x27;s Schumacher rear wing was removed in the crash, requiring him to drive slowly and make an unplanned pit stop for mechanics to replace it. The stop took 69 seconds, and he rejoined the course one lap behind the race leaders. The crash elevated Trulli, Räikkönen, and Villeneuve to higher-paying positions.

Further back, Sato overtook Button for 11th and Salo passed Irvine for 16th. Both Ferraris began to pull away from all other cars. On lap four, Salo overtook his teammate McNish in the midfield for 13th. Sato slipstreamed past Frentzen&#x27;s car into turn one for 10th place on lap seven, however he locked his front right wheel and went onto the grass, causing Frentzen to swerve to the left late in the manoevure to avoid a collision. Button used the situation to move into tenth and Sato almost collided with him and Frentzen upon rejoining the track. Sato overtook Frentzen on the inside at turn three on the same lap and began gaining on Button. Due to a spark plug failure, Räikkönen&#x27;s V10 engine began misfiring, meaning he had nine cylinders available and was slower from lap 13. He lost fifth to Villeneuve at the start of the main straight on the next lap. Montoya closed and passed Räikkönen on the inside for sixth on the main straight into turn one on lap 17. Irvine overtook Webber for 16th two laps later.

Because they were driving lighter cars, the two Ferrari drivers began trading new race lap records as they lapped slower cars. On lap 22, Panis was the first racer to make a scheduled pit stop, exiting after 8.4 seconds. While Barrichello lost almost a second to teammate Michael Schumacher while lapping Irvine and McNish, Villeneuve was the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop four laps later. He rejoined the track in 11th after a 9.4-second stop. The Ferrari and Michelin-shod teams were employing different pit stop strategies – Ferrari were planning to make two pit stops while Michelin-shod teams planned for one, possibly due to protect their tyres from failing. At the end of lap 27, Michael Schumacher made the first of two pit stops from the lead, remaining stationary for eight seconds before exiting the pit lane in second, ahead of Coulthard. Barrichello was promoted to the lead, setting the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:12.754 on lap 27 before his pit stop at the end of the following lap. His first pit stop similarly took eight seconds, and he rejoined in second place, behind teammate Michael Schumacher.

On lap 29, De La Rosa became the race&#x27;s first retirement when he was stuck in fifth gear. When his Jaguar caught fire, smoke billowed from the rear, and he pulled over to the pit lane entry to get out. The marshals instructed De La Rosa to jump over the Armco barrier, but he plunged into a river that flows beneath the circuit at that point, which the marshals did not tell him was there. Trulli made his first and only pit stop from fourth on the same lap and fell to seventh. Montoya misread a pit board message and made his only pit stop ten laps too early on the 33rd lap. His pit crew scrambled to his pit box and the mix-up meant he was stationary of 11.2 seconds and dropped to sixth. The delay in servicing the car and the damage to their one-stop strategy meant Montoya was racing for fourth place from that point. Irvine overtook McNish for tenth at turn one on lap 33. Villeneuve battled Trulli on the main straight and passed him for seventh into turn one on the next lap.

The yet-to-stop Coulthard remained close behind Barrichello as the two Ferraris scythed their way through slower traffic. Fisichella made his first and only pit stop from fifth on lap 37. This promoted Montoya to fifth and Villeneuve to sixth as Fisichella rejoined the circuit in ninth. On lap 41, the one-stopping Webber entered the Minardi garage to retire with a failed power steering system. Coulthard made his only pit stop from third at the conclusion of lap 42. His stop took 10.8 seconds to complete, and he rejoined the track in fourth, behind his teammate Räikkönen but ahead of Montoya. Räikkönen&#x27;s pit stop followed two laps later and fell to sixth, returning his teammate Coulthard to third, Montoya to fourth and Villeneuve to fifth. Yoong exited the course and entered the turn one run-off area, his engine blowing white smoke, due to an oil pump failure when he was in front of Barrichello on lap 49. The engine failure left oil on the racing surface.

At the end of lap 49, Michael Schumacher took his second pit stop from the lead, giving Barrichello one lap to try to gain an advantage. His 7.8-second stop saw him resume the track in second, ahead of Coulthard. Barrichello led the following lap until he entered the pit lane for his final stop and returned to the race in second. Frentzen slid off the track and into the turn four gravel trap on lap 51, but he kept driving by making his way back onto the track. Räikkönen became the Grand Prix&#x27;s final retirement on the following lap when he abandoned his McLaren at the side of the middle of the back straight, smoke billowing from its rear. Villeneuve made his second stop from fifth on the same lap and fell to sixth. McLaren altered Coulthard&#x27;s engine plan, and he drove cautiously for the final 20 laps to protect it.Michael Schumacher opened up a 3.4 second lead over his teammate Barrichello by the 64th lap, as Coulthard began steadily closing up to both drivers who had both reduced their pace. Montoya then gained on Coulthard, who replied by quickening his pace to counteract his faster pace. By the start of the last lap, Michael Schumacher was a half-second ahead of Barrichello, having slowed significantly from lap 69 to allow his teammate to catch up. Michael Schumacher slowed in the final two corners to allow Barrichello to close in further, and drove left up the banking turn 13 to give his teammate room and let him run alongside him to the finish line. Barrichello, who was initially hesitant about being alongside his teammate, passed Michael Schumacher and won by 0.011 seconds, his fourth win of the season and the fifth of his career. The 0.011-second margin of victory was the second-closest in Formula One history after Peter Gethin won the 1971 Italian Grand Prix by 0.01 seconds over Ronnie Peterson.

Coulthard finished third, Montoya fourth, the same place he started in, Trulli fifth, and Villeneuve sixth in the last points-paying position. Fisichella was seventh, having inconsistent tyres that made his car loose. Button in eighth was fast on the main straight but slow in the infield due to his wing settings. Heidfeld (who had more frontal understeer before his second pit stop making his car difficult to drive) and Irvine completed the top ten. Sato, in 11th place, had blistered tyres and a loose car. Panis finished 12th, owing to mechanical problems in the second half of the race. Frentzen finished 13th owing to oversteer, which overheated his rear tyres, and his helmet, which blocked part of the engine&#x27;s air inlet, limiting its power slightly due to his height. He was ahead of Salo in 14th, who had hydraulic pressure issues but had an engine misfire repaired by bi-directional telemetry. McNish finished 15th despite having car balance and handling issues owing to his steering locking up while turning right. Ralf Schumacher was the final classified finisher.

=== Post-race ===

Barrichello did not realise he had won the race until his crew told him over the radio late on the cool-down lap. The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in the subsequent press conference. Barrichello called the win &quot;very special&quot; and said, &quot;To win, it was very, very, very good... I got to the last corner, I didn&#x27;t know what to do and nothing has been said. Michael was just very kind to, you know, let us finish equally. I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?&quot; Michael Schumacher, who was reportedly angry over finishing second, praised his team&#x27;s strategy and his car, &quot;I think the strategy we used, two stops in the end was supposed to be by about ten seconds faster. But would we have been stuck behind, then our strategy could have been a problem. So, all in all, we did the right thing at the right time.&quot; Coulthard explained that being stuck behind slower cars was his attempt to not lose too much time and stay in third place, and he expressed astonishment at his quick start despite the heavy fuel load.

It was widely assumed that Michael Schumacher&#x27;s slowing on the penultimate lap was his way of repaying Barrichello for being ordered to allow him pass and win the earlier in the season, a hypothesis Ferrari rejected. Michael Schumacher stated Barrichello deserved to win but denied it was pre-planned, &quot;We have always supported each other. I thought today was a great opportunity to finish equal, to go together over the line, but we failed.&quot; Barrichello claimed he entered the final corner unsure what to do, &quot;Nothing was said. Michael was very kind to let us finish equally. I guess I just pointed a little bit in front.&quot; He later claimed that, like others, he was unsure whether he had won the race.

Team principals agreed that Ferrari made an error. Jordan team owner Eddie Jordan compared the staged finish to the end of golf&#x27;s Ryder Cup, which Europe won, and argued that dead heats were impossible given modern technology&#x27;s accuracy. BAR head David Richards described it as Ferrari &quot;covering up for a complete cock-up&quot; and called it &quot;showmanship&quot;. Ferrari team principal Jean Todt reiterated their view that team orders were not enforced, &quot;I think it would be very presumptuous and not humble at all to say that we are controlling everything.&quot; Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone believed Michael Schumacher should have admitted his error in the post-race press conference. IMS president Tony George hoped that the finish would increase interest in Formula One in the United States as it got people talking about the Grand Prix.

Williams technical director Patrick Head did not assign blame for the second-lap collision between his team&#x27;s drivers, but he heavily criticised them. Montoya said that his teammate Ralf Schumacher made an error that forced him off the track. Ralf Schumacher argued there was a lack of space for Montoya to pass him on the outside and said he would watch television coverage to get another perspective of the crash. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s driving, in which he unlapped himself during Irvine&#x27;s late-race duel with Heidfeld, was criticised by Irvine. Trulli was delighted to finish fifth and praised his strategy, &quot;Very happy. Good race, good start and good result in the end, thanks to the car&#x27;s reliability&quot;. Villeneuve said he had &quot;a good race&quot; despite scoring one championship point for finishing sixth, &quot;The team did a great job. It was a good weekend. We were competitive. That&#x27;s what matters.&quot;

Michael Schumacher maintained his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 134 points. Barrichello&#x27;s victory gave him second place in the standings with 71 points. Montoya maintained third place and extended his gap over teammate Ralf Schumacher in fourth place by three points, while Coulthard cut the gap to four points in fifth. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari with 205 points broke McLaren&#x27;s 1988 record for the most constructors&#x27; points scored in a season and extended their advantage over Williams, who secured second in the championship. McLaren remained in third while Renault and Sauber continued to battle for fourth with one round remaining in the season.

<text>Deon John Burton (born 25 October 1976) is a football coach and former professional footballer who played as a striker and who is the current manager of EFL Championship club West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s under-23 team. His numerous clubs in English football included Portsmouth, Derby County and Sheffield Wednesday. He represented Jamaica internationally, including at the 1998 World Cup, and was named Jamaican Sportsman of the Year in 1997.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Reading, Berkshire, Burton began his professional career with Portsmouth, with whom he made his debut in the 1993–94 season, playing in two games. Burton would play intermittently for Portsmouth over the next three seasons and scored the goal that kept the club in the First Division in a 1–0 final day win against Huddersfield Town in May 1996.

In 1997, former Portsmouth manager Jim Smith signed Burton for Premier League club Derby County in a £1 million move.

===Derby County, return to Portsmouth and loans===
Burton would again struggle to establish a starting role at Derby, playing intermittently there with loans at other clubs including Stoke in February 2002, and a second spell at Portsmouth, which began in August 2002. He returned to Derby in September having broken a bone in his foot, but later signed for Portsmouth in December 2002 for a fee rising to £250,000 and Portsmouth were promoted at the end of the season. Burton stayed shortly at Portsmouth, but, unable to establish a starting role, was loaned to Walsall and Swindon Town, where he scored once against Wycombe Wanderers. In July 2004 he signed for Brentford, playing for them in the 2004–05 campaign and helping the club to the League One play-off semi-finals against Sheffield Wednesday as their top scorer.

===Rotherham United===
In July 2005 he joined Rotherham United on a free transfer, signing a contract for two years. After scoring 14 goals in the first half of the season, including a hat-trick in a 4–0 victory against Blackpool, Burton put in a transfer request in December 2005.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Sheffield Wednesday bought Burton from Rotherham United in January 2006 for a fee of £110,000, after he had failed to turn up at the Yorkshire derby between Rotherham and Doncaster Rovers on New Year&#x27;s Eve. He scored his first goal for Wednesday in March 2006 against Queens Park Rangers.

He went on to play a crucial part in Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s Championship survival and returned to play against his old club Derby County on the final day of the 2005–06 season, captaining the Wednesday side to a 2–0 victory with another former Ram, Marcus Tudgay, scoring the first goal.

His good form for Wednesday led to a recall to the international stage. Named as a standby for the friendlies against Ghana and England, he was eventually called up as a replacement for Watford striker Marlon King who was sent home for a breach of discipline. Burton made a second-half appearance as substitute in the 6–0 defeat to England.

Despite only scoring one goal with four months of the 2006–07 campaign gone, Burton&#x27;s second half of season form was excellent. He scored 12 more goals, making him the club&#x27;s joint top scorer for the season, alongside Steve MacLean.

Burton reached a milestone 100 career goals at club level on 26 December 2007, scoring a penalty against Burnley at Turf Moor. On the last day of the season against Norwich, with Wednesday needing a win to guarantee survival, Burton cancelled out Darren Huckerby&#x27;s opening goal with a penalty, before scoring his second, and Wednesday&#x27;s third, later in the game, which was won 4–1 by Wednesday. These two goals brought his tally for the season to nine goals in all competitions, again making him the club&#x27;s top scorer for the 2007–08 season. Burton scored his first goal of the 2008–09 season on 25 November 2008, in Wednesday&#x27;s 0–2 away win at Blackpool.

===Charlton Athletic===
Burton joined Championship side Charlton Athletic on loan on 27 November 2008 with a view to a permanent move, Wednesday manager Brian Laws citing Burton&#x27;s poor start to the 2008–09 season for the move as well as not being able to give the player assurances over his long-term future at Hillsborough. On 2 January 2009, Burton was named as a permanent Charlton player, joining the club on a free transfer.

===Gabala===
In 2010, Burton joined Azerbaijan Premier League outfit Gabala under the management of Tony Adams signing a two-year contract. After two years and 15 goals in the 50 league games, Burton left Gabala at the end of the 2011–12 season.

===Gillingham===
On 7 August 2012, Burton signed a one-year deal at League Two club Gillingham, turning down the offer of a deal at an unnamed League One side. He made his debut for Gillingham on 18 August 2012 in 3–1 win over Bradford City. He scored his first goal for the club on 25 August in a 2–1 win away to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. Burton was not offered an extension to his contract and left the club.

===Later career===
Burton signed for League Two club Scunthorpe United on a one-year deal on 22 July 2013 after impressing on trial. He joined League Two team York City, managed by his former Scunthorpe manager Russ Wilcox, on a one-month loan on 30 October 2014. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 away win over Cheltenham Town, but after being ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury sustained in his second appearance for the club, the loan came to an end on 12 November 2014.

Burton was released from Scunthorpe in January 2015 and then joined Eastleigh the following month.

After a short spell at Eastleigh, Burton signed for Brackley Town on 8 August 2015. He then moved on to Worcester City in September 2015. He retired from football at the end of the 2015–16 season.

Burton now runs a football training company called Deon Burton Training Academy.

== Coaching career ==
In 2018, Burton joined West Bromwich Albion as a youth coach. In July 2020, Burton was named as the manager of the U23 team after he had impressed when he took over on a temporary basis when Michael Appleton left the role to join to Lincoln City in September 2019. On 13 May 2022, Burton lead West Brom U23 to victory in the 2021–22 Premier League Cup, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers U23s on penalties in the final.

==International career==
Burton made his debut for the Jamaica national team on 7 September 1997 in the latter stages of their 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. He finished with four goals from five games, an exploit which won him Jamaican Sportsman of the Year Award for almost single-handedly getting the country to the 1998 FIFA World Cup finals. However, he failed to score in France.
He also appeared in each of Jamaica&#x27;s games as they finished fourth in the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup but he failed to score.
He was also in the squad that failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and was again included on the roster for the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

He was included in the qualifying squad for the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup, making substitute appearances but was dropped from the squad after qualification.

Burton had to wait three years for his next international involvement – coming against the country of his birth England. Good form for Sheffield Wednesday meant that he was recalled for a friendly match against Trinidad and Tobago on 27 March 2008. He came on as a second-half substitute for Marlon King in a 2–2 draw. He kept his place in the squad for the next friendly game against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 3 June, again coming off the bench for King in the second half, to score his side&#x27;s fourth goal a minute later and also to cross for Ricardo Gardner to score the fifth and final goal in the 87th minute of a 5–1 victory.

<doc id="1123492" wikidata="Q305802" url="?curid=1123492" title="2002 Japanese Grand Prix">
<text>The 2002 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the 2002 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Suzuka on 13 October 2002, the seventeenth and final race of the 2002 FIA Formula One World Championship. It is also the last race held on this layout.

The 53-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari. Schumacher took pole position, led the whole race except during the pit stops, and set the fastest race lap. It was his eleventh win of the season and the fifteenth for the Ferrari team, thus equalling the record set by McLaren in . Teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second, with Kimi Räikkönen third in a McLaren-Mercedes.

This was the last race for runner-up Eddie Irvine and Mika Salo, who had been in F1 since 1993 and 1994 respectively. It was also the last race for Alex Yoong and Allan McNish, though the latter could not participate in the race itself due to injuries suffered in a heavy crash during qualifying.

This was the last race to use the 10-6-4-3-2-1 points system first introduced in 1991, and also the last race to use the race weekend format first introduced in 1996, with 3 practice sessions (two on Friday, one on Saturday morning), a one-hour qualifying session and a Sunday morning warm-up. The race would also mark Ferrari&#x27;s last one-two finish for a year until the 2004 Australian Grand Prix.

==Background==
With both drivers and constructors title already decided, the fight in the championships concentrated on the lower ranks. In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Juan Pablo Montoya was 3rd, 5 points ahead of teammate Ralf Schumacher. For Ralf to take 3rd, he needed to either win the race, provided that Montoya finished lower than second, or to finish second with Montoya out of the point-scoring positions. David Coulthard had a slim chance of winning 3rd place but that could only happen if he won the Japanese Grand Prix with Montoya finishing 3rd or lower. Coulthard could take 4th in the Championship by finishing 4th and ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Further down, a number of drivers had a chance to improve their final ranking.

In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari, Williams and McLaren had secured 1st to 3rd. Renault had almost clinched 4th as Sauber would needed at least to win the race with their second car finishing in the points to take 4th. Four points separated four teams (Sauber on 11, Jaguar with 8 and both Honda runners BAR and Jordan with 7 points each) in a tough fight for positions, as the final ranking influenced how much a team received from the revenue of TV rights.

Ferrari were expected to dominate this race. If Michael Schumacher managed to win the race, he would improve his record number of wins with a perfect finishing record, as Schumacher had not retired from any race that year and had finished every race on the podium. This was the first Formula 1 race for Toyota at their home country of Japan.

A number of teams were testing the previous week before the Grand Prix. McLaren, Williams, Toyota and BAR were at Barcelona and McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz broke the lap record there. Ferrari were testing at Mugello with Sauber and at Jerez and Fiorano while Renault and Jordan tested at Silverstone. The teams concentrated on set-up for the Grand Prix as well as testing components for the 2003 season.

==Qualifying==
Michael Schumacher grabbed his 7th pole position of the season and the 50th of his career ahead of teammate Rubens Barrichello and David Coulthard. Kimi Räikkönen was 4th ahead of Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya. Takuma Sato managed 7th and his best ever qualifying ahead of his teammate Giancarlo Fisichella. Jacques Villeneuve was 9th with Jenson Button wrapping up the top 10.

The session was interrupted for over 75 minutes after Allan McNish appeared to have lost control of his car and crashed backwards through the safety barrier at the 130R curve. The back of his car was destroyed, luckily though he didn&#x27;t sustain any major injuries. He qualified in 18th, however was unfit to start the race.

The fight for pole turned to be a no-contest with Michael Schumacher convincingly faster than anyone else here including his teammate. The fight at the front was really between the other 5 drivers of the top 3 teams. For most of the session they appeared to be evenly matched however Barrichello, Coulthard and Räikkönen all managed to improve late in the session while Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya didn&#x27;t and hence the final order.

Behind the top 3 teams, the Jordan team took the honours of the best of the rest thanks to a more powerful Honda engine. Takuma Sato impressed his home crowds by not just outqualifying his teammate but also ending up in 7th and only 1.773 seconds off Michael&#x27;s pace despite this being his first time on the track in a Formula 1 car. Behind Sato, it was close as expected with 1 second separating Sato in 7th and Massa in 15th.

In addition to McNish&#x27;s crash, Olivier Panis and Eddie Irvine suffered from car problems and had to stop on the track. Panis managed to get back and use the spare but Irvine didn&#x27;t.

In the battle of the teammates, Mika Salo managed to qualify 1.449 seconds ahead of Allan McNish although McNish had his crash and only had 1 run. Jacques Villeneuve managed to qualify 0.843 seconds ahead of Olivier Panis but again Panis had car problems and had to switch to the spare and Michael Schumacher managed to out-qualify Rubens Barrichello by 0.432 seconds.
Closest were Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya with just 0.063 seconds separating them. David Coulthard managed to be 0.109 seconds ahead of Kimi Räikkönen and Jenson Button was 0.118 seconds ahead of Jarno Trulli who also suffered a car problem on his final run.

Takuma Sato had his best qualifying position the season while Michael Schumacher once again equalled his best. Both Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya equalled their worst qualifying positions this season.

<doc id="1123493" wikidata="Q2990635" url="?curid=1123493" title="Composition C">
<text>The Composition C family is a family of related US-specified plastic explosives consisting primarily of RDX. All can be moulded by hand for use in demolition work and packed by hand into shaped-charge devices. Variants have different proportions and plasticisers and include Composition C-1, Composition C-2, Composition C-3, and Composition C-4.

==History==
The term &quot;Composition&quot; is used for any explosive material compounded from several ingredients. In particular, in the 1940s the format &quot;Composition &lt;letter&gt;&quot; was used for various compositions of the (relatively) novel explosive RDX, such as Composition B and other variants.

==Development==
The original material was developed by the British during World War II, and was used in the Gammon bomb. It was standardised as Composition C when introduced to US service. This material consisted of 88.3% RDX and a mineral oil-based plasticiser and phlegmatiser. It suffered from a relatively limited range of serviceable temperatures, and was replaced by Composition C-2 around 1943, which would later be redeveloped around 1944 as Composition C-3. Research on a replacement for C-3 was begun prior to 1950, but the new generation of Composition C (C-4) did not begin pilot production until 1956.

===Composition===
Composition C-1 contained a slightly smaller proportion of RDX, but used an explosive plasticiser, which contained tetryl, nitrocellulose and a mixture of nitroaromatics produced during the manufacture of TNT (containing trinitrotoluene, dinitrotoluene, and mononitrotoluene), and a trace of solvent.

==Characteristics and usage==
Composition C-3 was very similar to Composition C-1, but removed the solvent and varied the exact proportions of plasticisers to improve high temperature storage. It is a yellow, putty-like material. It remained a service item through the Korean War, but had marginal plasticity at the very low temperatures encountered in Korean winters, and was significantly toxic, including by vapour and skin absorption. While Composition C-3 had a much wider serviceable temperature range than Composition C-1, it could not be stored at elevated temperatures. Consequently, it would eventually be replaced by Composition C-4. The velocity of detonation is about 7600 m/s (25,000 feet per second).

Composition C-3 consists of 77%–85% cyclonite (RDX) and 15%–23% gel made out of liquid nitro compounds (e.g. liquid DNT and small amount of NT) and nitrocellulose or butyl phthalate and nitrocellulose.

One of the first reported and tested compositions of C-3 was very similar to earlier Composition C-2 and contained 77% RDX, 3% tetryl, 4% TNT, 1% NC, 5% NT, and 10% DNT. The last two compounds (they are very poor explosives) are oily liquids and plasticise the mixture. The most important later innovation of C-3 introduced the non-explosive plasticiser butyl phthalate instead of this mixture of nitro compounds. This reduced the toxicity while increasing the concentration of RDX and improving safety of use and storage. It also opened the way to begin study of new non-explosive low-toxicity plasticisers (esters of dicarboxylic acid) and binder (branched polymers).

==Properties==
Since 1960 the mixture of C-4 has contained:
* 90.0–91.0% of cyclonite (RDX explosives)
* ~2.1% of polyisobutylene (short chain)
* ~1.6% of motor oil
* ~5.3% of di-(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (dioctyl sebacate), sometimes it was replaced partly by similar compounds such as dioctyl adipate
* less than 0.6% of water
* (small amount of marker or odorising taggant)

It is less volatile than C-3 and has less tendency to harden at low temperature. It has a density 1.48–1.60 g/ml, does not become hard even at −55 °C (−67 °F), and does not exude at +77 °C (171 °F). C-4 has a detonation velocity of 8092 m/s (26550 ft/s) at high density and velocity of 7550 m/s (24770 ft/s) at low density 1.48 g/ml. It is so successful that it remains in army service up to the current time without any significant changes.

<text>The Hall of Supreme Harmony (; Manchu: ;Möllendorff: &quot;amba hūwaliyambure deyen&quot;) is the largest hall within the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. It is located at its central axis, behind the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Built above three levels of marble stone base, and surrounded by bronze incense burners, the Hall of Supreme Harmony is one of the largest wooden structures within China. It was the location where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties hosted their enthronement and wedding ceremonies. The name of the Hall was changed several times throughout the past few centuries, from its initial Fengtian Dian (奉天殿), later to Huangji Dian (皇极殿) in 1562 and to the current one by the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty in 1645.

Together with the Hall of Central Harmony and Hall of Preserving Harmony, the three halls constitute the heart of the Outer Court of the Forbidden City.

The Hall of Supreme Harmony rises some above the level of the surrounding square. It is the ceremonial center of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is eleven bays wide – with the main room being nine bays wide – and five bays deep, the numbers nine and five being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor. The six pillars nearest the imperial throne are covered with gold, and the entire area is decorated with a dragon motif. The Dragon Throne, in particular, has five dragons coiled around the back and handrests. The screen behind it features sets of nine dragons, again reflecting the &quot;nine-five&quot; symbolism. The Hall of Supreme Harmony features an exquisite throne made of red sandalwood, and formerly used by the emperors of the Qing dynasty.

Set into the ceiling directly above the throne is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the &quot;Xuanyuan Mirror&quot;, a reference to the Yellow Emperor, a mythological Chinese ruler. According to legend, the metal balls will fall and strike dead any usurper to the throne.

In the Ming dynasty, the emperors held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, emperors held court far more frequently. As a result, the location was changed to the Inner Court, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as enthronements, investitures, and imperial weddings.

The original hall was built in 1421 during the Ming dynasty, destroyed seven times by fires during the Qing dynasty, and rebuilt for the last time in 1695–1697. After a reconstruction in the 16th century, the dimensions of the hall were reduced from around to its present measurements, . Inability to find sufficiently large logs was cited as the cause for this change.
