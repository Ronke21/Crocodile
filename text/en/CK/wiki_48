<text>The is a Japanese professional baseball team based in Kitahiroshima, Hokkaidō, in the Sapporo metropolitan area. They compete in the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball, playing the majority of their home games at ES CON Field Hokkaido. The Fighters also host a select number of regional home games in cities across Hokkaidō, including Hakodate, Asahikawa, Kushiro, and Obihiro. The team&#x27;s name comes from its parent organization, Nippon Ham, a major Japanese food-processing company.

Founded in 1946, the Fighters called Tokyo home for 58 years, as co-tenants of the Tokyo Dome and Korakuen Stadium with the Central League&#x27;s Yomiuri Giants near the end of their tenure in the capital city. The franchise has won three Japan Series titles, in 1962, 2006, and, most recently, 2016.

==Team history==

===Senators and Tokyo eras===
In 1946, Saburo Yokozawa, manager of the Tokyo Senators in 1936–1937 (and later a prominent umpire), looked to revive the franchise and soon founded the new Senators. He assembled a team of ready and able players like Hiroshi Oshita, Shigeya Iijima and Giichiro Shiraki, but as a newly formed team the Senators faced strict fiscal management and resorted to using hand-me-down uniforms from the Hankyu Railway&#x27;s pre-war team (who would eventually become the modern-day Orix Buffaloes). Former Japanese statesman Kinkazu Saionji, grandson of the influential Kinmochi Saionji, became the team&#x27;s owner, and Noboru Oride, borrowing heavily from a Ginza cabaret proprietor, became the team&#x27;s sponsor. Eventually, trapped by a lack of funds, Yokozawa was forced to resign as the team&#x27;s manager.

For a time, the team was even mockingly nicknamed &quot;Seito&quot; (Bluestockings) after a Japanese feminist magazine of the same name. As the Yomiuri Giants&#x27; pet name was &quot;Kyojin&quot;, baseball personality Soutaro Suzuki thought that other teams should also have pet names like the Giants, and names such as the Osaka Tigers&#x27; alias &quot;Mouko&quot; (fierce tiger), the Senators&#x27; &quot;Seito&quot; and the Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Taihei&quot; (tranquility) began to be used by the press. However, the other teams rejected the use of these pet names, so they were not fully adopted.

On January 7, 1947, the team was sold to the Tokyu Corporation. The Tokyu baseball club was inaugurated into the league, and the team&#x27;s name became the Tokyu Flyers. At that time Tokyu dominated the Japanese transportation sector, owning several other railway companies, although it was faced with troubles and the possibility of a breakup. Tokyu purchased the team to act as a banner of solidarity for the swelling company, and managing director Hiroshi Okawa assumed ownership of the club. The newly born Flyers, with Hiroshi Oshita becoming one of the most popular players in the league, began to attract many fans, but the team&#x27;s administration still went into a deficit.

With the formation of the National Baseball League drawing nearer, in 1948 the not-yet-affiliated Daiei club, which had played a few exhibition games against the Otsuka Athletics, joined with Tokyu to create the Kyuei Flyers (&quot;Kyuei&quot; being a portmanteau of the two companies&#x27; names). However, Daiei decided to purchase a separate team, the Kinsei Stars, and after only one year the Flyers reverted to their former name.

During the off-season of 1949, the Flyers joined the Pacific League after the former league split. In September 1953, the team completed a new ballpark—Komazawa Stadium—along one of Tokyu&#x27;s train lines in Setagaya, Tokyo, moving from Bunkyo ward&#x27;s Korakuen Stadium. The Flyers&#x27; wild play on the field eventually earned them the nickname, &quot;Komazawa&#x27;s hooligans&quot;.

===Toei and Nittaku eras===
On February 1, 1954, Tokyu entrusted the management of the Flyers to the Toei Company, of which Okawa had newly become president. Toei transferred control of the club to a subsidiary company, Toei Kogyo (industrial enterprise). The team&#x27;s name was changed to the Toei Flyers, and its legal name consequently became the Toei Flyers Baseball Club. This name stuck for nineteen years.

In 1961, when Yomiuri Giants manager Shigeru Mizuhara resigned from his position, Okawa attempted to woo him to join his team, bringing him to a bar in Kyoto and calling famous movie producer Koji Shundo to meet with them. Shundo, an old drinking buddy of Mizuhara&#x27;s, convinced the four-time Japan Series champion manager to join the Flyers, and he solidified a strong relationship with Okawa and Toei Studios.

Komazawa Stadium was to be torn down to make way for the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, so in 1962 the Flyers moved their base of operations to Meiji Jingu Stadium in Shinjuku. (At that time, college baseball teams had priority at Meiji Jingu, so during weekends or other times when school games were being played the Flyers had to use Korakuen or another field for their games.) In the same year, two star aces, Masayuki Dobashi and Yukio Ozaki, blossomed under Mizuhara&#x27;s coaching and the Flyers captured their first league championship. They would go on to defy odds in the Japan Series and defeat the Hanshin Tigers for their first Japan Series title. This championship would be their only one in the Toei era. The Kokutetsu Swallows jointly occupied Meiji Jingu with the Flyers the following season, and in 1964 the Flyers went back to their old home, Korakuen, also home of the Yomiuri Giants; both the Fighters and Giants would share a home for the next 39 years.

The Flyers assembled a group of powerful sluggers over the next few years—among them: Isao Harimoto, Katsuo Osugi, Inchon Bek, and Shoichi Busujima—but on top of a declining movie industry and the &quot;Black Mist&quot; match-fixing scandal that rocked the professional baseball world in 1970 (after which Flyers ace Toshiaki Moriyasu was banned from the game for life), in 1971 Flyers owner Okawa died suddenly. Shigeru Okada, who did not view Okawa favorably, took over Toei after his death. Together with Noboru Goto, company president of Tokyu and loyal friend of Okada (and one who also thought unfavorably of Okawa), Okada let go of the unprofitable team.

The team was sold to Akitaka Nishimura of the Nittaku Home real estate enterprise, a common acquaintance of Okada and Goto, on February 7, 1973. The team&#x27;s name became the Nittaku Home Flyers. Nishimura, in an attempt to inject life back into the unpopular Pacific League, developed seven different uniforms for his team and experimented in every aspect of the team&#x27;s operation, but the effort failed to produce results. Believing that the Pacific League&#x27;s chances of survival were grim, Nishimura was on the verge of partnering with the Lotte Orions, who were eyeing a league reunification. When the deal fell through, Nishimura, tired of the baseball establishment, resigned from his leadership position and abandoned the Flyers.

===Nippon-Ham era===
On November 19, 1973, meatpacking company Nippon Ham purchased the team, led by owner Yoshinori Okoso. Okoso had bought the team as he was willing to bring them back to prominence when essentially no one wanted them. He loved them to death, so much so that he never held any company meetings when the team was playing, and if where he was at, they were not on TV or radio, he would dispatch employees to go to that game and update him via payphone. The club&#x27;s name was changed to the Nippon-Ham Fighters, its official name became the Nippon-Ham Baseball Corporation. Osamu Mihara became the team president and Futoshi Nakanishi, Mihara&#x27;s son-in-law, as its manager. After 27 years, the &quot;Flyers&quot; nickname was abandoned. The &quot;Fighters&quot; nickname was born from a public appeal by the team&#x27;s management. A female high school student from Okayama prefecture submitted the winning name, giving the reasoning that &quot;(former Fighters player) Katsuo Osugi has guts, so he&#x27;s a fighter.&quot; Osugi would be traded to the Yakult Swallows soon after the Fighters were rechristened. The same would be for Zainichi Korean Isao Harimoto, as Nakanishi hated Harimoto for challenging his authority, going nearly as far as trying to release him. This was also because Harimoto was upset that the FIghters sent away Osugi, and that he was the only reason he stuck around. In fact, when the then-Flyers attempted to trade Osugi to the Hanshin Tigers for Yutaka Enatsu (who the Fighters would ironically get later), Harimoto went to the front office and demanded they immediately cancel the trade. However, Okoso did not want to let him go, as Nippon-Ham had a major presence in South Korea, and it did wonders for sales having one of the greatest Koreans play for them, and having traded their other Korean player, Baek In-chun, to the Taiheyo Club Lions in 1974, Okoso was worried Nippon-Ham would completely lose their presence in South Korea. Mihara, however, persisted, and they nearly sent him to the Hanshin Tigers, before the Yomiuri Giants made a convincing last-minute deal to send him there instead.

Over the four seasons between 1974 and 1977, the Fighters dwelled at the bottom of the Pacific League, but after improving to finishing in third place for three straight years between 1978 and 1980, manager Keiji Osawa finally led the Fighters to their second Pacific League pennant in 1981. With saves leader Yutaka Enatsu and starter Shigekuni Mashiba (who went 15–0 over the season) forming the heart of the pitching staff, the Fighters shined with offensive sluggers Tony Solaita, Junichi Kashiwabara, and Tommy Cruz. The team that year also featured various important players of smaller stature, like Makoto Shimada and Nobuhiro Takashiro. They would go on to play the Yomiuri Giants in the Japan Series, where the Fighters lost in six games.

At the time, the franchise shared Korakuen Stadium with the Giants, so scheduling games throughout the season for both teams posed a problem. League schedulers tried to avoid putting the Fighters and the Giants at Korakuen on the same day, but when they both had home games scheduled, league officials made the implicit decision that the Giants would play during the day and the Fighters during the night. One novel aspect of the Fighters was that they attracted armies of grade-school boys to sit in the outfield stands on weekend games under a &quot;Young Boys’ Fan Club&quot; promotion, starting the first organized fan club in Japanese professional baseball.

During the 1980s the Fighters hosted many of the Pacific League&#x27;s leading pitchers, including Isamu Kida (led the P.L. with 22 wins in his rookie year in 1980; won MVP, Rookie of the Year the same year), Mikio Kudō (20 wins in 1982), Hiroshi Tsuno (recorded double-digit win totals in several years throughout the mid-eighties) and Yasumitsu Shibata (three-time All Star; recorded no-hitter in 1990). Yukihiro Nishizaki particularly stood out, recording 15 wins and an ERA under three in each of his first two years (though the Rookie of the Year title eluded him), racking up seven double-digit win seasons over the course of his eleven-year stay with the Fighters and gaining a considerable following from female fans due to his easy-going demeanor. In 1986 shortstop Yukio Tanaka joined the club; he remained with the team for 22 seasons, becoming known as &quot;Mr. Fighters&quot;.

From 1988 until the move to Hokkaidō, the Fighters played their home games in Tokyo Dome, the stadium that replaced their longtime home Korakuen. After the Dome was finished, the pitching dominance of Yukihiro Nishizaki and Yasumitsu Shibata began to emerge. Keiji Osawa came out of retirement to manage the team for a third time in 1993, only to see his team sink to the bottom of the standings; he gained notoriety for kneeling to the fans at the end of that season, begging for their forgiveness. With the Fighters experiencing more managerial troubles in 1996, then-manager Toshiharu Ueda suddenly took a personal leave during a pennant race with the Orix BlueWave, eventually causing the Fighters to fade over the last month of the season. However, new life was born in Tokyo Dome in 1998. Hitters such as Nigel Wilson, Jerry Brooks, Yukio Tanaka, Atsushi Kataoka, Katsuhiro Nishiura and a young Michihiro Ogasawara formed what became known as the Big Bang lineup and subsequently shattered various batting records. They ran away with first place for the first half of the season, but a pitching collapse in the second half caused a fall of historical proportions. The Fighters would ultimately finish in second place to the Seibu Lions.

===Hokkaido Nippon-Ham era===
Prior to the 2002 season, the idea of moving the Fighters to Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaidō and Japan&#x27;s fifth largest city, emerged. The Seibu Lions also had preliminary plans to move to the northern metropolis. Tokyo&#x27;s Fighters fans voiced their opposition to the proposed relocation (though the franchise never drew as many fans as their co-habitual counterparts, the Giants, while playing in the capital), but it was eventually announced that the team would indeed call the Sapporo Dome its new home beginning in 2004. Aiming to build a grassroots relationship with its future fans, the team decided to change its name to the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.

At first, with the unhappy Seibu Lions suddenly changing their approval vote, Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe and Seibu owner Yoshiaki Tsutsumi voiced their concerns over the move. They believed that Nippon Ham&#x27;s choice to move the team would spur a decentralization in Japanese professional baseball, and they threatened that a decrease in the number of teams in the Kantō and Kansai regions should merit a one-league system instead of two. As a matter of fact, the question of reorganizing baseball&#x27;s league structure eventually became a bigger issue than the sale and renaming of the Kintetsu Buffaloes. The issue eventually settled down, though, and the Fighters&#x27; relocation was eventually approved by the league. The response from the people of Hokkaidō was weak, but NPB fans welcomed the move, noting that the Fighters could now be free from the Tokyo Dome&#x27;s high rent and perpetual second-billing to the Giants. Out of respect for the Tokyo-based Fighters fans, the team decided to schedule a few &quot;home&quot; games per season at the Tokyo Dome.

After the move finally was complete in 2004, the Fighters signed former-Tigers superstar Tsuyoshi Shinjo, who came back to NPB from MLB after playing with the New York Mets and nearly winning a World Series title with the San Francisco Giants and a revitalized Fernando Seguignol. American manager Trey Hillman led the team to success in his second year on the job, and at the end of the season, the Fighters were in a fierce race with the Chiba Lotte Marines for the final spot in the new P.L. playoff system. With a vital win over the Orix BlueWave on September 24, the newly moved Fighters earned a trip to the postseason, advancing to play Seibu in a three-game series. Though they put up a strong effort against Seibu ace Daisuke Matsuzaka, the Fighters lost the first game of the series 6–5. They took Game 2 by a score of 5–4. In the decisive third game, the Fighters fought back in the ninth inning after trailing for the whole game but ultimately fell to a Kazuhiro Wada walk-off home run, losing 6–5. The Fighters would have to wait for another chance for the P.L. pennant.

During the pennant race, the Fighters began selling tickets for infield reserved seats at a low 1,500 yen price point, in an attempt to draw fans to the park. At and after 7:30 pm, usually well after the first pitch, the team began selling special child-fare tickets called &quot;730 Tickets&quot; (they started the same promotion at the Tokyo Dome in 2005). In addition to these, in 2005 they added extra-low priced tickets, discount parking passes and beer coupons to attract more fans. As a result of these promotions, and partially due to the rising popularity of young pitcher Yu Darvish, drafted the year before, the left field stands became constantly sold out for exhibition games, regular season games and playoff games, filled with loud and raucous Ōendan. Even the right field stands, usually occupied by the visiting team&#x27;s fans, began to fill with Fighters supporters. In 2005, the Fighters drew over 1,000,000 fans for the first time since 1993, ranking second in the P.L. after the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.

Also in 2005, a previously unknown manager, Shigeru Takada, became the club&#x27;s first general manager. On April 27, owner Yoshinori Ohkoso died. The Fighters retired the number 100 in his honor 4 years later, a first in club history (also the first retired number for owners in NPB; in North American Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (Gene Autry, 26) and St. Louis Cardinals (August A. Busch Jr., 85) have retired numbers, and in Minor League Baseball, the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers (Dale Earnhardt Sr., 3) are the most notable team owners with retired numbers). The number 100 was chosen, because when the Fighters won the 1981 Pacific League pennant, their first under Nippon-Ham, Okoso was given a ceremonial jersey number of 100. Yukio Tanaka reached a career 1,000 RBI total, and Makoto Kaneko joined the 1,000 hit club in the same year. On September 20 the Lions smashed the Fighters at home, crushing the Fighters’ hopes of making the playoffs for the second year in a row. In the offseason, the Fighters acquired Major League veteran José Macías, and as former number one starter Yusaku Iriki tried his luck in America, the club attempted to sign Kazuhisa Ishii, but failed. In the draft, the team selected pitchers Tomoya Yagi and Masaru Takeda. And before the 2006 season, Shigeyuki Furuki and Kazunari Sanematsu were traded to the Giants for pitcher Hideki Okajima.

The 2006 season would turn out to be a monumental one for the Fighters. After defeating the Tokyo Yakult Swallows on the final day of interleague play, the Fighters went on an eleven-game winning streak, the best such streak for the franchise in over 45 years and tying the team record. After achieving the feat, the team had a six- and a seven-game winning streak, demonstrating to the rest of the P.L. that they were a dangerous club.

A fierce struggle for first place developed between the Fighters, Lions and Hawks. On September 27, the Fighters emerged in first place, earning the title &quot;Regular Season Champions&quot;. They also boasted the best team ERA (3.05) and the best team home run total (135) in the NPB. Yu Darvish had an especially impressive year, winning 12 games and posting an ERA of 2.89, establishing himself as the ace of the Fighters’ staff.

The Fighters swept the Hawks in the second stage of the P.L. playoffs to earn their third pennant. In the Japan Series, the team won their first Japanese championship in 44 years, defeating the Chunichi Dragons in five games. Fittingly, Darvish pitched for the win in the final game of the series. The series&#x27; MVP honors went to Fighters&#x27; outfielder Atsunori Inaba, who hit for a .357 batting average during the series with one home run and six RBIs. The championship win was especially fitting for OF Tsuyoshi Shinjo, who was a longtime veteran of the Hanshin Tigers (who were perennial losers), and also had played for a brief time in the United States&#x27; Major League Baseball. It was Shinjo&#x27;s ultimate desire to win a championship, and he did in the final year of his illustrious career in Japan with Nippon-Ham. Shinjo would return 14 years later for a tryout, but failed to qualify. He, however, would go on to be later named manager.

This victory gave the Fighters a berth in the four-team Asia Series, in which the team went undefeated in the round-robin and won the final 1–0 over the La New Bears.

The 2006 offseason saw the departure of two of Nippon-Ham&#x27;s best players, both via free agency. First baseman Michihiro Ogasawara was signed to a blockbuster contract with the Yomiuri Giants, and left-handed reliever Hideki Okajima departed to the Boston Red Sox. At the start of the 2007 season, Nippon-Ham had a lot of trouble scoring runs, relying far too much on their pitching, despite the continuing maturation of Yu Darvish, who had back-to-back complete game, 14-strikeout performances early in the season. At one point, Nippon Ham was second-to-last in the Pacific League, but recently has been able to turn it around. With the start of Interleague play, Nippon-Ham began a 14-game winning streak, which ended on June 9 with a 3–2 extra inning loss to the Yakult Swallows, with the bullpen wasting another great performance by Darvish.

The Fighters went on to win the Pacific League championship and went through the Climax Series to earn a second consecutive trip to the Japan Series to once again face the Chunichi Dragons. But in a reversal of roles from last year, the Fighters took Game 1, but the Dragons took the next four games to defeat the Fighters; the last of which being a combined perfect game by Dragons pitchers Daisuke Yamai and Hitoki Iwase.

In 2007, Yukio Tanaka&#x27;s final season, he recorded his 2000th career hit, during a May 15 game against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.

The Fighters would win the Pacific League championship again in 2009 and 2012, but they would lose both times in the Japan Series to the Yomiuri Giants.

In 2012, the Fighters drafted Shohei Ohtani, who made his debut in 2013. Despite Otani wanting to play in MLB, the Fighters drafted him anyways as they would have lost him to an MLB team. Otani signed with the Fighters nonetheless. Otani, with his ability to both pitch and hit, quickly became a star for the team. He was selected as an NPB all-star five times and was named Pacific League MVP in 2016. Behind Otani, the Fighters returned to the Japan Series in 2016, facing the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. After dropping the first two games on the road, the Fighters rallied to win the next four games en route to their first championship since 2006.

In 2017, the Fighters drafted Kotaro Kiyomiya, a child prodigy entering the draft with high expectations and a number 1 overall pick. The Fighters got his contract negotiation rights after winning a lottery in the draft between 6 other NPB teams. As Japan would soon find out however, he became a draft bust. What made it even worse was Munetaka Murakami, also on Kiyomiya&#x27;s draft class, who was drafted by the Swallows after losing out to him, was hitting more home runs than him at a rapid pace and already won a Japan Series title with the Swallows. As of 2022, Kiyomiya only had 21 home runs, while Murakami already had 104, and became the youngest NPB player to hit 100 home runs, at only 22 years old. Kiyomiya also did not play on the first squad in 2021. Kiyomiya was also being plagued by injuries, whilst Murakami managed to stay healthy and has played the full 143 game schedule with the Swallows. However, in recent years, Kiyomiya would develop himself into a better player, and by 2024, he was back as a regular on the Fighters top team.

In 2017, Otani left the Fighters to sign with the Los Angeles Angels.

On January 8, 2018, the Fighters signed a partnership agreement with the Texas Rangers to exchange scouting info with each other and the Rangers will share advice to the Fighters for their plans to build ES-CON Field Hokkaido. ES-CON Field plans would be similar to the then-under construction Globe Life Field in Arlington. Both ballparks would have mixed use community districts, and similar structure, hence why both ballparks look very similar. Also, this was due to the stadium being designed by HKS Architects, who also designed Globe Life Field.

In October 2021, the Fighters replaced longtime manager Hideki Kuriyama, who went on to become manager of Samurai Japan, with former player Tsuyoshi Shinjo. He is best known for winning his first Japan Series title in his last game before retirement.

On January 21, 2022, new manager Tsuyoshi Shinjo unveiled a new logo and uniform for the Fighters. The response from fans was mixed to mostly negative. Fans often compared their jerseys to the Toronto Blue Jays due to the font they used.

On March 24, 2022, Shinjo was approved by the NPB to be registered as &quot;BIGBOSS&quot; for the 2022 season.

On September 28, 2022, the Fighters played their final game at Sapporo Dome, an 11–3 loss to the Chiba Lotte Marines and the team finished the season with the worst record in the NPB. After the game, it was announced that Tsuyoshi Shinjo would continue being manager for the 2023 season, but he will not wear &quot;BIGBOSS&quot; on his jersey, and that the BIGBOSS persona would be retired. They would again fare poorly in the 2023 season, finishing with the 3rd worst record in the NPB, primarily thanks to the team suffering a 14 game losing streak in the middle of the year, including 7 straight games of losing by a lone run. However, one of the biggest standouts that year was from Japanese-Congo player Chusei Mannami, who finished with the second most home runs in Pacific League, hitting 25, just below Gregory Polanco, Kensuke Kondoh, and Hideto Asamura, who all hit 26 each. He also became the second player in NPB history to hit a lead-off and walk-off home run in the same game against the Hawks in September.

2024 would prove to be a standout year for the Fighters, finally making the playoffs for the first time since 2018, with a record of 75-60-8, finishing in 2nd place. Among individual accomplishments included Chusei Mannami winning his second Golden Glove award, new foreign signing Franmil Reyes making the Best Nine for the Pacific League, alongside breaking Fernando Seguignol&#x27;s Fighters record for most consecutive games with a hit at 25 games, and Shun Mizutani, whom the Fighters acquired from the Hawks in the active player draft, having a breakout season, culminating in him winning Interleague MVP. In the postseason, after going down in the first game against the Chiba Lotte Marines, and seeming to be going down in the second, with Shinjo stating he wasn&#x27;t going to use team ace Hiromi Itoh, because he thought he would be needed for the Final Stage against the Hawks, Mannami would hit a game tying home run off Naoya Masuda, then Daiki Asama would then hit a walkoff hit an inning later. After winning the 3rd game, the Fighters would advance to the Final Stage, where they would get swept by the Hawks in 3 games, with SoftBank getting a 1 game advantage.

== The Fox Dance ==
The Fox Dance is a tradition of the Fighters to do during the middle of innings, in which they encouraged fans, alongside cheerleaders, to dance similarly to the moves of a fox, set to the Ylvis song &quot;The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)&quot;, which began in May 2022. The origins of this tradition came from Fighters staff member and former Fighters Girl member Sari Ogure, who watched the music video 2 years prior. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic disallowing any cheering or singing at games, she wanted to make a choreographed dance that would be simple for anyone to memorize, especially children. She had planned to propose this dance, but waited until it was right for her to do so, which came at the hiring of Tsuyoshi Shinjo as manager, after then manager Hideki Kuriyama left the team to become the manager of Samurai Japan.

The dance was introduced in a game against the Saitama Seibu Lions, and while it was not a hit right out of the gate, the dance began to majorly gain traction after Pacific League TV (Pacific League&#x27;s centralized streaming service) and the Fighters posted the dance on their YouTube channels. The dance, from then on out, became a major hit at Fighters games, and despite the team struggling in 2022, it became an entertaining part of games. It became so popular that on September 19, 2022, Ylvis went to Japan and performed the song live prior to a game against the Chiba Lotte Marines.

The dance&#x27;s success led to the term &quot;fox dance&quot; to be ranked 3rd in the New Word/Buzzword Contest in 2022, a contest about new words/terms that were popular in Japan in a particular year, behind Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine (in honor of the attacks of Russia to Ukraine in 2022) and Murakami-sama (after Tokyo Yakult Swallows player Munetaka Murakami&#x27;s 2022 season, where he broke Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s single season home run record for Japanese born players), with the ceremony being attended by Ogure herself, Fighters Girl members, and mascot Frep the Fox, the main idea sake of the dance itself. Fighters Girl members, alongside Japanese idol group Hinatazaka46, performed the song during the Kohaku Uta Gassen annual concert on New Year&#x27;s Eve on December 31, 2022.

Notable names that done the dance with Fighters Girl include actress and former Takarazuka Revue member Sei Matobu, Japanese idol group Nogizaka46 member Saya Kanagawa, and Fox Sports analyst and brother of MLB pitcher Justin Verlander, Ben Verlander, amongst other people, including opposing team&#x27;s cheerleading squads.

The dance has also found itself being performed in a few areas thanks to its popularity, including one by the cheerdancing squad of CPBL team Rakuten Monkeys (which is also thanks in fact that the club is owned by Rakuten, the same company who owns the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of NPB), another by J.League club Cerezo Osaka (due in part to the club being partially owned by Fighters owner Nippon-Ham), and it appearing in multiple shows in Japan, including a performance during an annual event sponsored by Nippon TV, with NPB players Naoyuki Uwasawa and Shugo Maki.

== Dschinghis Khan Dance ==
Another dance tradition the Fighters have was introduced in 2023, coinciding with their move to Es Con Field Hokkaido, also following the success of The Fox Dance, named the Dschinghis Khan dance. Similar to The Fox Dance, fans, alongside cheerleaders would dance, this time with a tambourine shaped like a pot from the era of Genghis Khan, which can also relate to the local cuisine of Hokkaido. The song that accompanies it is a Japanese cover by Fighters Girl of the song of the same name by the eponymous disco group from Germany. The dance was also upgraded on the 29th of April to coincide with the beginning of Golden Week in Japan, adding sheep ear headbands to the cheerleaders.

*Boy wearing a uniform (official name unknown): Appeared in the logo from 1982–1987. 
*Görotan (ギョロタン) (retired): a large red fuzzy creature with long feathered hair that served as mascot from 1980 to 1987. He is based on the sun. He often rode on a bicycle, but in later years he rode on a scooter. He was the first costumed mascot in the Pacific League. In 2014, he returned in the Legend Series along with Fighty, and they have appeared at every Legend Series since.
*Fight-kun (ファイトくん) (retired): a winged warrior with a bat and a helmet who first appeared in 1988 as a replacement for Görotan. Appeared as a logo and as a costume.
*Armored warrior (official name unknown): Appeared in the logo from 1993–2003.
*Fighty (ファイティー) (retired): a bright pink pterodactyl whose head resembled a giant leg of ham and who sometimes rode a bicycle around the field. He appeared from 1993–2005. On August 17, 2005, Fighty was retired, despite the (unsuccessful) &quot;Save Fighty&quot; campaign, when the Fighters moved to Hokkaidō. In 2014, he returned in the Legend Series along with Görotan, and they have appeared at every Legend Series since.
*B·B (Brisky the Bear) (ブリスキー・ザ・ベアー): a black bear with a black mohawk on his head. Although his full name is Brisky, he prefers to be called B·B. On Sundays, the mohawk is orange, and sometimes the mohawk is white. In 212 Story locations, his mohawk is pink. He first appeared in 2004, as the successor to Fighty. When B·B was first introduced, his appearance was criticized by some of the Fighters&#x27; supporters for being too Americanized. On the Fighters official website, B·B has his own photo gallery and column. The costume was updated in 2005 because the original costume was becoming damaged and it was difficult to perform in. On April 5, 2006, B·B injured his left foot during a match at the Tokyo Dome and was diagnosed with a serious injury of 3 months. He appeared with a crutch the next day, and returned on July 4, 2006. B·B was also the mascot of Nippon Ham from 2004–2017. He has his own section on the website called B·B Diary. In 2019, he launched a blog, which was called B·B The Home. As of 2022, he has barely appeared in any more games, and is primarily now going around different communities in Hokkaido.
*baby・B (ベビー・ビー) (retired): a young version of B·B who is an elementary school student. He first appeared in 2010. He resembles his father. In his first appearance, he appeared on the monitor and watered the crowd with a hose. Since then, he has calmed down by receiving direct guidance from B·B. He does not exist as a mascot costume. As of 2022, no media has surfaced to prove he was a real mascot of the Fighters at all.
*Cubby (Cubby the Bear) (カビー・ザ・ベアー): a brown bear and younger brother of B·B. Although it shows the text &quot;C·B&quot; on the back of his uniform, it is pronounced &quot;Cubby&quot; and not &quot;Sea B&quot;. He loves to eat strange foods, but because of this he has a weak stomach and becomes embarrassed when this is brought up. He appeared in 2006 as the mascot of the Fighters&#x27; minor league team, based in Kamagaya, Chiba. He also has a Twitter account. Cubby and B·B performed for each team, but also sometimes perform together when the Fighters&#x27; professional team plays in Tokyo. He sometimes goes to kindergartens and nursery schools, and in 2010 he was appointed as a one-day Chief of the Kamagaya Police Station and participated in the crime prevention campaign.
*Polly Polaris (ポリーポラリス): a brown squirrel who appeared late 2012, at the same time when the Fighters announced their 10th season. She&#x27;s the first female mascot that was introduced to the team. Her current look now has her fur be a lighter shade of brown compared to her introduction. According to her backstory, she was childhood friends with Brisky.
* Frep the Fox (フレップ・ザ・フォックス): An Ezo red fox, who debuted in March 2016. He is gray with red markings, and he is considered an &quot;apprentice&quot;. In 2018, he graduated from apprentice status and he replaced B·B as the main mascot, although B·B still performs at almost all games. He also has an Instagram account, and B·B and Polly also post on there. On May 6, 2019, Frep injured his left leg during a performance at the Zozo Marine Stadium. He planned to return on June 1, 2019. However, he did not return until June 28, 2019, when he appeared with a cast. On June 13, 2018, in a game against the Hanshin Tigers, he was involved in a wrestling match against Jushin Liger after a ceremonial first pitch and lost the match.

<doc id="1132159" wikidata="Q5336135" url="?curid=1132159" title="Eddie Howe">
<text>Edward John Frank Howe (born 29 November 1977) is an English professional football manager and former player, who is the manager of Premier League club Newcastle United.

A centre-back during his playing career, Howe spent most of his playing career with AFC Bournemouth, coming up through the youth system and spending eight years with the club, before returning for a second three-year spell to end his career, and retiring from the professional game in 2007. He entered management the following year, taking charge of a Bournemouth side facing relegation to the Conference National in January 2009 as the youngest manager in the Football League. Under his guidance, Bournemouth were able to avoid relegation during his first season in charge, having started the season on minus 17 points, and were promoted to League One the following campaign. 

After a brief spell as manager at Burnley, Howe returned to Bournemouth, and led them to two further promotions in three seasons, taking them to the top division of English football. He was subsequently named Football League Manager of the Decade in 2015 following three promotions in a seven-year period. Bournemouth survived in the Premier League for the next five seasons under Howe, before suffering relegation to the Championship in 2020. He resigned as manager of Bournemouth after the club&#x27;s relegation. At the time of his departure, Howe was the longest-serving manager in the Premier League. After a year away from the game, Howe returned to management in 2021 when he was appointed as head coach of Newcastle United following the takeover of the club.

==Playing career==
Howe was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. When very young, he moved to Verwood in Dorset, and later began his footballing career with local youth teams Rossgarth and Parley Sports before starting his professional career at AFC Bournemouth. He made his first-team debut in December 1995 against Hull City. Howe established himself as an important player in Bournemouth&#x27;s defence, and in 1998, he was selected for the England Under-21 team in the Toulon Tournament.

In March 2002, Portsmouth signed Howe for £400,000, making him new manager Harry Redknapp&#x27;s first signing. Shortly after signing, a knee injury on his debut against Preston North End ended his season.

He returned for the opening game of the 2002–03 season against Nottingham Forest, but he injured his knee again after only nine minutes and was ruled out for the entire campaign. He did not return to full fitness until January 2004 after 18 months out. He was loaned to Swindon Town on transfer deadline day in March, although he did not feature for the club.

Portsmouth loaned Howe back to Bournemouth for the first three months of the 2004–05 season. He proved to be successful on his return to his first club after two injury-ravaged seasons with Portsmouth. With the club in a very poor financial state, supporters joined to create &quot;Eddieshare&quot; to fund a transfer fee. Days later, £21,000 was raised to fund the required permanent transfer fee. After a further three seasons and over 270 appearances, injuries forced his retirement as a player in 2007 and he then moved into coaching with the reserve squad.

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
In December 2006, at the age of 29, Howe was promoted to the position of player-coach by manager Kevin Bond, and handed the task of coaching Bournemouth&#x27;s reserve team, though he continued to play in the first team. He retired from football in summer 2007, after he was unable to recover from a knee injury. In September 2008, Howe lost his job when Bond was sacked as manager.

===AFC Bournemouth===
Howe returned to Bournemouth as a youth coach under Jimmy Quinn and took over as caretaker manager when Quinn was sacked on 31 December 2008. Even though his two games in charge as caretaker manager were away defeats, he was hired as the permanent manager of the club on 19 January 2009 and brought the club out of the relegation zone despite a 17-point deficit.

In the start of the 2009–10 season, Howe won eight out of the nine games, a club record. In November 2009, Championship club Peterborough United approached Howe to replace Darren Ferguson as their manager but Howe rejected their approach.

Despite the club&#x27;s transfer embargo remaining in place for the rest of the season, Bournemouth secured promotion to League One after two years in the fourth tier of English football thanks to a 2–0 away win at Burton Albion on 24 April 2010.

In early 2011, Howe was approached by several other clubs but on 11 January announced that he was staying at Bournemouth. However, on 14 January 2011, Howe became the new Burnley manager after the club agreed a compensation deal with AFC Bournemouth. He took charge of his 100th and final Bournemouth match of his first managerial spell with the club, later that day in a 2–1 defeat away to Colchester United.

===Burnley===
On 16 January 2011, Howe was announced as the new manager of Burnley after signing a three-and-a-half-year contract at the Championship club. His first game in charge of Burnley was away to Scunthorpe on 22 January 2011, which ended in a 0–0 draw. Burnley finished eighth in the Championship in season 2010–11 and 13th in season 2011–12 under Howe. He left Burnley in October 2012 citing &quot;personal reasons&quot; for his departure.

===Return to AFC Bournemouth===
In October 2012, he re-joined his former club Bournemouth as manager. He won the League One Manager of the Month for November after guiding the club to three league wins and two draws, as well as an FA Cup victory. On 20 April 2013, he secured promotion to the Championship with Bournemouth finishing runners-up and one point behind champions Doncaster Rovers. In the 2013–14 season, Howe&#x27;s Bournemouth finished tenth in the Championship, six points outside of the play-off positions.

On 19 April 2015, Howe was selected as the Manager of the Decade at the Football League Awards.

On 27 April 2015, he secured Bournemouth&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League. Bournemouth beat Bolton Wanderers 3–0 at the Goldsands Stadium, a win which while not guaranteeing Premier League football for the 2015–16 season, required third placed side Middlesbrough to overcome a 19-goal goal difference with one game left in the season. Howe said of the promotion and of Bournemouth supporters: &quot;It shouldn&#x27;t be them thanking me, it should be me thanking them. It is a family club and deserves its moment in the sun.&quot; Bournemouth confirmed their promotion on the last day of the season, 2 May 2015, with a 3–0 victory at Charlton Athletic and, due to already-promoted Watford&#x27;s failure to win their last match, were crowned champions of the league.

Howe guided Bournemouth to Premier League survival in their first season in the top flight football, with a 16th-place finish seeing them five points clear of the relegation zone. An even better campaign in 2016–17 saw Bournemouth finish ninth. A year later, he took them to 12th place in the Premier League to secure a fourth consecutive campaign at this level.

Howe&#x27;s side finished in 14th in the 2018–19 Premier League, but the club&#x27;s five-year stay in the Premier League ended in 2019–20 after Bournemouth finished in 18th place.

On 1 August 2020, Bournemouth announced that Howe had left the club by mutual consent, after eight years in charge. He became noted at Bournemouth for bringing in young players, improving them, and selling them on at a financial profit.

In May 2021, Howe rejected an offer to become the manager of Celtic. A club statement blamed factors &quot;outwith both his and our control&quot; for the breakdown in their negotiations.

===Newcastle United===
Howe was appointed to replace Steve Bruce as the manager of Premier League club Newcastle United on 8 November 2021, signing a contract until the summer of 2024. Howe watched from the stands as the club drew 1–1 with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, in a game in which Graeme Jones was acting as caretaker manager. Jones was retained as first team assistant coach as part of Howe&#x27;s new coaching staff, which also included Jason Tindall, Stephen Purches and Simon Weatherstone, whom he worked with at Bournemouth, as well as retained Newcastle goalkeeping coach Simon Smith.

His appointment at Newcastle also reunited him with former players at Bournemouth, such as Callum Wilson, Matt Ritchie and Ryan Fraser. On 19 November 2021, Newcastle announced that Howe had tested positive for COVID-19 and would miss the first game in charge. He watched his first game as manager from a hotel room as Newcastle drew 3–3 with Brentford on 20 November.

On 20 April 2022, following a 1–0 victory against Crystal Palace, Howe guided Newcastle to a sixth successive home win, the first time the club had achieved such a feat since 2004 under Sir Bobby Robson. He guided Newcastle to an eleventh place finish in the Premier League after winning twelve in the last 18 games of the season, and made sure Newcastle became the first team in Premier League history to avoid relegation after not winning any of the first 14 games they played. On 5 August 2022, Howe was rewarded with a long-term contract at the club.

On 31 January 2023, Howe guided Newcastle to the EFL Cup final following a 3–1 aggregate victory over Southampton; their first cup final in over 23 years.

On 22 May 2023, following a goalless home draw against Leicester City, Howe guided Newcastle to a top-four finish in the Premier League and qualification for the UEFA Champions League, their first entry into the competition since 2002–03.

In the Champions League, Newcastle United finished bottom of their group with five points, failing to qualify for both the round of 16 and the Europa League, despite beating French Ligue 1 champions Paris-Saint-Germain 4–1 in Newcastle&#x27;s first home Champions League match in 20 years. 

On 6 January 2024, in the third round of FA Cup, in the 157th Tyne-Wear derby, Howe led Newcastle to victory over Sunderland, a 3–0 win at the Stadium of Light. This marked Newcastle&#x27;s first win over the Black Cats since 2011.

Despite many injuries, Howe guided Newcastle to their highest ever scoring Premier League season with 85 goals scored and finished seventh; losing out on a Europa Conference League qualification spot due to Manchester United beating Manchester City 2-1 in the 2024 FA Cup final.

On 5 February 2025, Howe guided Newcastle to another EFL Cup final following a 4-0 aggregate victory over Arsenal, the first leg of the tie bringing Newcastle their first win at the Emirates since 2010.

== Managerial style ==
Howe completed his coaching badges with the Irish FA in 2011, implementing a tactically flexible system with the teams that he manages. Howe&#x27;s coaching style has been influenced by such football managers as Jurgen Klopp, Johan Cruyff and Diego Simeone, having spent time observing the latter&#x27;s training methods after leaving Bournemouth. Many of Howe&#x27;s man-management techniques have been influenced by John Wooden, former American college basketball coach. 

Tactically, Howe prefers a 4–3–3 in possession, switching to a 4–5–1 out of possession, with an emphasis placed on pressing the oppositions defence, resulting in a higher amount of quick-turnovers. During the 2023–24 Premier League season, Newcastle United had increased defensive injuries, forcing Howe to use 3–4–2–1 and 4–4–2, however this meant that the team produced their highest ever goal scoring campaign, netting 85 goals in 38 games.

==Personal life==
Howe and his wife Vicki have three sons. On 5 March 2019, Howe was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Bournemouth by Bournemouth Borough Council. His childhood club was Everton. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Howe became the first Premier League manager to take a pay cut. His half brother, Steve Lovell, is a scout at Bournemouth.

<doc id="1132161" wikidata="Q269061" url="?curid=1132161" title="London Underground rolling stock">
<text>London Underground rolling stock includes the electric multiple-unit trains used on the London Underground. These come in two sizes, smaller deep-level tube trains and larger sub-surface trains of a similar size to those on British main lines, both running on standard gauge tracks. New trains are designed for the maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars.

The first underground passenger services started in 1863 when the Metropolitan Railway opened using steam locomotives hauling gas-lit wooden carriages, braked from a guards&#x27; compartment. In 1890, the City and South London Railway opened the world&#x27;s first deep-level tube railway, using electric locomotives pulling carriages with small windows, nicknamed &quot;padded cells&quot;. Other tube railways opened in the early 20th century using electric multiple units known as &#x27;gate stock&#x27;, as access to them was via lattice gates at each end of the car. The earlier railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines by 1907. 

Pneumatic sliding doors were introduced on tube trains in 1919 and sub-surface trains in the late 1930s. Until the early 1960s an electric locomotive was exchanged for a steam locomotive on Metropolitan line services beyond Rickmansworth. The Victoria line opened in the late 1960s using automatic train operation (ATO), and the last trains ran with a guard in 2000. , the Central, Jubilee, and Northern lines also use forms of ATO, the latter two using a system called TBTC (transmission-based train control).

The older sub-surface trains were replaced between 2010 and 2017 by new air-conditioned S Stock, and the replacement of the 1972 Stock and the 1973 Stock on the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines respectively is currently under consideration. They will be replaced by the New Tube for London.

==Current stock==
London Underground trains come in two sizes, larger sub-surface trains and smaller deep-tube trains. Since the early 1960s all passenger trains have been electric multiple units (EMUs) with sliding doors. A train last ran with a guard in 2000. All lines use fixed-length trains with between six and eight cars, except for the Waterloo &amp; City line, which uses four cars. New trains, which are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars, have regenerative braking and public address systems.

Since 1999, all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs, and the size and location of door controls. All underground trains are required to comply with The Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 (RVAR 2010) by 2020.

Stock on sub-surface lines is identified by a letter (such as S Stock, used on all subsurface lines), while tube stock is identified by the year in which it was designed (such as 1996 Stock, used on the Jubilee line).

==Future development plans==
===New Tube for London (NTfL) (2024 Stock)===
The Deep tube programme (DTP) originally covered the replacement of the trains and signalling on the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines. It had been expanded to cover rolling stock requirements arising from the planned extension of the Northern line to Battersea, the eventual replacement of Central line trains and proposed increased service frequency on the Northern and Jubilee lines. The EVO tube concept design, a lighter articulated train with walk through cars, was introduced early in 2011. In early 2014 the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Central and Waterloo &amp; City line rolling stock replacement project was renamed New Tube for London (NTfL) and moved from its feasibility stage to the design and specification stage. In late 2024 the first NTFL trains were delivered for storage and testing in London.

The proposal introduces fully automated trains and signalling to replace 1972 Stock, 1973 Stock &amp; 1992 Stock and increase capacity on the Piccadilly, Central, Waterloo &amp; City and Bakerloo lines between 2025 and 2033. The fully automated trains may not have drivers. The ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying that it would be unsafe. Internal investigations from TfL revealed that the upgrades required to operate driverless trains were economically unviable.
==History==
===Steam locomotives===
====District Railway====

The first services were run by the Metropolitan Railway. In 1871 the District Railway began running its own services with locomotives that were identical to the Metropolitan Railway A Class already in use. Twenty were supplied initially, and by 1905 the District had 54 locomotives. After the railway had been electrified by 1907 all but six of the steam locomotives had been sold. In 1925 two locomotives were retained for departmental use.

====Metropolitan Railway====
Concern about smoke and steam in the tunnels led to trials before the line opened with an experimental &quot;hot brick&quot; locomotive nicknamed Fowler&#x27;s Ghost. This was unsuccessful and the first public trains were hauled by broad gauge GWR Metropolitan Class condensing 2-4-0 tank engines designed by Daniel Gooch. These were followed by standard gauge Great Northern Railway locomotives and then by the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s own standard gauge locomotives. All tank engines, these locomotives were classified by letters of the alphabet. Initially eighteen A Class (4-4-0) were ordered in 1864. By 1870 a total of forty-four had been built. In 1885, an improved version was ordered and twenty-two B Class were built.

From 1891, more locomotives were needed for work on the line from Baker Street into the country. Four C Class (0-4-4) were received in 1891 and six D Class (2-4-0) in 1894. From 1896 to 1901 seven E Class (0-4-4) locomotives were built to replace the A class on this line. In 1901 the Met also received four F Class (0-6-2), a freight variant of the E Class. Not all these new locomotives were fitted with the condensing equipment needed to work south of Finchley Road.

The need for more powerful engines meant in 1915 four G Class (0-6-4) arrived, named after people or places associated with the Metropolitan Railway. Eight capable H Class (4-4-4) were built in 1920 for express passenger services, replacing the C and D class locomotives. In 1925, six freight K Class (2-6-4) locomotives arrived. These were out of gauge south of Finchley Road.

====London Passenger Transport Board====
In November 1937, the later Metropolitan Railway G, H and K Class steam locomotives were transferred to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), who took over all freight workings and became responsible for hauling passenger trains with steam locomotives north of Rickmansworth. From the early 1940s, these were replaced by ex Great Central Railway locomotives, now classified LNER Class A5. These were replaced in 1948 by LNER L1s. Former LMS locomotives replaced the L1s ten years later, when the joint line was transferred to British Railways&#x27; London Midland Region. Steam working ended on passenger trains in 1961, after electrification and the introduction of A Stock electric multiple units.

===Electric locomotives===
The City and South London Railway tube line opened in 1890 with electric locomotives hauling carriages. Initially the locomotive could haul three carriages at an average ; the trains were air braked, their reservoirs topped up at Stockwell. Fourteen locomotives were initially built, soon supplemented by more. When the railway was extended in 1900 a further 30 locomotives to an improved design were built, and 10 of the first generation rebuilt. In 1923 the railway was closed for reconstruction and tunnel enlargement, and the line reopened using newly built Standard Stock electrical multiple units.

When the Central London Railway opened in 1900, carriages were hauled by electric locomotives. However, the 44-ton locomotives had a high unsprung weight of 34 tons, and these caused noise and vibrations that could be felt at ground level. In 1902–03 the carriages were reformed into multiple units using a control system developed by Frank Sprague in Chicago.

The District Railway used electric locomotives on electrified underground lines that were exchanged for steam locomotives to continue over unelectrified track. Ten were built in 1905, and these operated in pairs, initially used to haul London and North Western Railway passenger trains on their Outer Circle route between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House. From 1910 trains from the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway were extended over the District, the steam locomotives being exchanged for electric ones at Barking. These locomotives were scrapped after the service was withdrawn in 1939.

Similarly Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives were used with conventional carriage stock. On the outer suburban routes an electric locomotive was used at the Baker Street end that was exchanged for a steam locomotive en route. The first ten had a central cab and were known as camel-backs, and these entered service in 1906. A year later another ten units with a box design and a driving position at both ends arrived. These were replaced by more powerful units in the early 1920s. The locomotives were withdrawn from passenger service after electrification to Amersham was completed in 1961, although three were kept as shunters.

===Carriages===

The Metropolitan Railway opened in 1863 with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. Lighting was provided by gas — two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated from the guards&#x27; compartments at the front and back of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. The Metropolitan and District railways both used loco-hauled carriages exclusively until they electrified in the early 20th century. The District railway replaced all its carriages with electric multiple units. The Metropolitan still used loco-hauled carriages on the outer suburban routes, where an electric locomotive at the Baker Street end was exchanged for a steam locomotive en route. Carriages were introduced in the later years of the 19th century that gave a better ride quality, steam heating, automatic vacuum brakes, electric lighting and upholstered seating in all classes.

The City &amp; South London Railway tube line opened in 1890, with electric locomotives which hauled three carriages. Originally only provided with small windows, these were soon nicknamed &quot;padded cells&quot;. These were replaced with standard tube stock when the line was rebuilt in 1923. The Central London Railway briefly used carriages when it opened in 1900, but these were re-formed into multiple units in 1902–03. New carriages, nicknamed &quot;Dreadnoughts&quot;, were introduced on the Metropolitan main line in 1910. Two rakes had a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. They contained a toilet and were built with steam heating. Electric heating was fitted in 1925. All carriages on the London Underground were replaced by the A Stock multiple units in the early 1960s.

===Sub-surface electric multiple units===

Before 1933 the sub-surface lines were run by two companies, the District Railway and Metropolitan Railway. The Circle line was operated jointly, although the Metropolitan operated most of the services from 1926.

====District Railway====

In 1903, the District tested two seven-car trains with different control and brake systems on its unopened line between Ealing and South Harrow. Access to the car was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand-operated sliding doors on the car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls, and two- and three-car trains operated from Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town) to Hounslow Town and South Harrow and later Uxbridge, until they were withdrawn in 1925.

The District Railway ordered 60 × 7-car electric trains in 1903. A third of the vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France, and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by sliding doors, double doors in the centre and single doors at either end. First- and third-class accommodation was provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with an equal number of motor and trailer cars running in either two- or four-car formations off-peak. 

By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three hand-operated double sliding doors on each side.

In 1923, fifty motor cars were ordered to allow some of the original 1904–05 cars to be scrapped. In 1926, the District Railway classified its rolling stock using letters of the alphabet, the original prototype being A Stock, the production cars B Stock, and so on. In that year, two stock pools were created. Mainline trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel-bodied cars originally constructed in 1910–14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden-bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified &#x27;local stock&#x27; worked the shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.

====Metropolitan Railway====

The first order for electric multiple units was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 motor cars with Westinghouse equipment, which ran as 6-car trains. First- and third-class accommodation was provided in open saloons, second class being withdrawn from the Met. Access was at the ends via open lattice gates and the units were modified so that they could run off-peak as 3-car units. For the joint Hammersmith &amp; City line service, the Met and the Great Western Railway purchased twenty 6-car trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. 

In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for another 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. Before 1918, the motor cars with the more powerful engines were used on circle services with three trailers. The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all of the cars had been modified to replace the gates with vestibules by 1907. Having access only through the two end doors became a problem on busy circle services and centre sliding doors were fitted from 1911.

From 1906, some of the Ashbury bogie stock was converted into multiple units by fitting cabs, control equipment and motors. In 1910, two motor cars were modified with driving cabs at both ends. They started work on the Uxbridge-South Harrow shuttle service, before being transferred to the Addison Road shuttle in 1918. From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles were used between Watford and Rickmansworth.

In 1913, an order was placed for 23 motor cars and 20 trailers, saloon cars with sliding doors at the end and the middle. These started work on circle services, including the new electric service to New Cross via the East London line. In 1921, 20 motor cars, 33 trailers and 6 first-class driving trailers were received with three pairs of double sliding doors on each side. These were introduced on circle services.

Between 1927 and 1933 multiple unit compartment stock was built in batches by the Metropolitan Carriage &amp; Wagon and Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company companies to be used on electric services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The first order was only for motor cars; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metropolitan-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the motor cars working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the motor cars had the same motor equipment but used vacuum brakes, and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form &#x27;MV&#x27; units. 

In 1929, &#x27;MW&#x27; stock was ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the &#x27;MV&#x27; units, but with Westinghouse brakes. A further batch of &#x27;MW&#x27; stock was ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase the length of the previous &#x27;MW&#x27; batch trains to 8 coaches. These had GEC WT545 motors, and although designed to work in multiple with the MV153, this did not work well in practice.

====London Transport====
In 1933, the Metropolitan and District railways were merged with the other underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board (LTPB). In 1934, ninety former Metropolitan Railway cars were refurbished to form the Circle Stock. Although most of these cars were made in 1921, some were older. The motors were replaced and the cars were repainted a red and cream. Serving the Metropolitan main line there were three incompatible types of multiple unit compartment stock that had been built in 1927–33, and these were assembled into 9 × 8-car and 10 × 6-car trains after Westinghouse brakes were fitted and some cars regeared. The LPTB, continuing the District Railway multiple unt classification system labelled these T Stock. 

In 1932 the District Railway to Upminster had been electrified and new vehicles bought. Similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors to most of the District line stock, these becoming Q Stock and allowing the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars not suitable for conversion retained their hand-worked doors, and known as H Stock these ran until 1957.
The joint Met and GWR stock on the Hammersmith &amp; City line dating from 1905 was replaced by O stock that initially operated in 4 and 6-car formations, entering service from 1937. However, the train was entirely made of motor cars and this caused a problem with the electrical supply, so trailer cars were added from 1938. P Stock was ordered to replace all the remaining Metropolitan multiple units. A combination of 3-car units and 2-car units to run in six and eight car trains were delivered from July 1939. Two trailers were included in an eight car formation, but these were designed to allow conversion to motor cars at a later date after improvements to the power supply.

After World War II, R Stock, composed of new cars and the Q Stock trailers that had been built in 1938, replaced the trains with hand-operated sliding doors that remained on the District line. The new trains were built between 1949 and 1959, and after 1952 trains were constructed from aluminium, saving weight. One train was left unpainted as an experiment and considered a success, so between 1963–68 trains were left unpainted or painted white or grey to match. A number of former District Railway F Stock became available for use on the Metropolitan line. These mainly worked the semi-fast Harrow and Uxbridge services, although they also ran on the East London line as modified four-car sets. This transfer allowed the Circle Stock to be replaced by 5-car trains of O and P Stock. After 1955, the traction control equipment was replaced on these trains and the cars relabelled CO and CP stock as appropriate.

When the Amersham electrification project commenced in 1959, London Transport placed an order for 248 cars of A60 stock to replace the T stock and remaining locomotive hauled trains. A further twenty-seven trains of the A62 stock were built in 1962–63 to replace the F and P stock trains on the Uxbridge service. These were arranged as 4-car units which could operate as four or eight car trains.
Four car units operated on the Chesham shuttle and, from 1977, on the East London line. The transfer of CO/CP Stock from the Metropolitan to the District line in the early 1960s allowed some of the Q stock to be scrapped. 

In 1968, an order was placed for 35 six car trains to replace the CO/CP Stock on the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines. These were arranged as two units with a driving cab in the motor car at one end only and normally run as three pairs. These trains were designated C69 stock. The remaining CO/CP and R Stock on the District line were replaced in the late 1970s by new trains. A shorter train was needed on the Edgware Road branch due to the platform lengths so more of the C stock units. The rest of the District line could use longer trains and new D Stock trains were introduced between 1980 and 1983. 

A new Fire Safety Code of Practice, drawn up following the King&#x27;s Cross fire in November 1987, lead to internal refurbishment of trains that included replacing the interior panelling and fitting or improving the public address systems. At the same time the exterior of the trains were painted as it had proved difficult to remove graffiti from unpainted aluminium. The first refurbished trains were presented to the media in September 1989, and the project launched in July 1991.

In the early 2010s, A, C and D Stock trains used on the Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines were replaced by new air-conditioned, open-gangway S Stock trains. Also, the sub-surface track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme designed to increase peak-hour capacity by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface network is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s.

===Tube electric multiple units===
====Early trains====
The first tube railway, the City and South London Railway, opened in 1890 with electric locomotives hauling carriages. In 1898, the Waterloo and City Railway opened to the public using electric multiple units. Each four-car train had two trailers and two motor-cars with two motors that could be directly controlled from either car. A four car train seated 204, and access was by sliding doors at the car ends leading to a platform protected by a gate.
When the Central London Railway opened in 1900, carriages were hauled by heavy electric locomotives that caused vibrations that could be felt on the surface. In 1903, 64 motor-cars were delivered and the carriages were reformed into multiple units using a control system developed by Frank Sprague in Chicago. Initially there were 168 carriages, each long, with access via sliding doors to a gated platform as on the Waterloo &amp; City. Seating was mostly longitudinal for 48 passengers and straps were provided for those standing. The Great Northern and City Railway was a built to take main line trains from the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Finsbury Park to the City at a terminus at Moorgate. However the GNR refused permission for trains to use its Finsbury Park station, so platforms were built beneath the station instead. Public service on the line began in 1904, using larger electric multiple units with control equipment supplied by British Thomson-Houston.

The Underground Electric Railways Company of London had been established in April 1902 by the American Charles Yerkes to build and run three cross-London tube lines: the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (now part of the Northern line), Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Bakerloo line) and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Piccadilly line). A power station capable of providing power for these tube lines was built at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek. 

Similar electric multiple units were purchased for the three lines, controversially from America, France and Hungary, and known as &quot;Gate Stock&quot;, as access to the cars was via lattice gates at each end. Motor cars, trailers and control trailers were coupled to make a train of two to six cars, with the motor cars positioned at the outer ends. These had full width control compartments behind the driver and seated about 40, whereas the trailers seated about 50. A gateman operated the lattice gates using a crank handle and announced each station as the train approached. A bell rung by the rear guard when all gates were closed was echoed down the train by each gateman until the front guard signalled the driver to proceed.

More trains were bought in 1914 for the Bakerloo line extension to Paddington. To speed up boarding these cars had inward swinging centre doors that were under the control of the gatemen. From 1915 the Bakerloo was extended to a junction with the London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR) at Queen&#x27;s Park and because of the difficulties of World War I, cars were transferred from the Piccadilly line. From 1917 tube trains ran through to using Central London Railway motor cars that had been built for an uncompleted extension to Ealing. 

These returned in 1920 when the extension opened and the Watford Joint Stock, two thirds owned by the LNWR, arrived. Four and six car trains were formed, a motor car permitted in the middle of a tube train as there was an emergency passage through the control compartment. Access was by three single inwardly swinging doors on either side of the cars. Cars with sliding pneumatic doors were ordered in 1919 for the Piccadilly line. No gatesmen were needed and these trains were staffed by a driver and two guards. An open door was first indicated by a semaphore arm, but these were easily damaged, and by 1923 interlock switches proving the doors were closed were introduced.

====Standard Stock====

There were major extensions of the City &amp; South London and the Hampstead lines in the 1920s. The tunnels of the City &amp; South London Railway were rebuilt to have the same diameter of the other tubes, and extended north to a junction with the Hampstead line at Camden Town, and south to Morden. The Hampstead line was extended to Edgware and south to another junction with the City &amp; South London at Kennington, this opening in 1926. New stock was required to run on the rebuilt City &amp; South London and extensions so in 1922 six prototype cars were ordered from five manufacturers. With attention given to noise reduction, there were two pneumatic doors on each side of the trailers. 

From this development work a total of 1,460 cars of Standard Stock were built by six manufacturers in 18 batches between 1923 and 1934. Production cars were first ordered in 1923. The Hampstead line received the first of these later in 1923. Motor cars had a control compartment with a central gangway over the motored bogie and seated 30. The trailers seated 48 and the control trailers 44, with transverse and longitudinal seating. Initially trains had a crew of three, a driver and two guards. In 1928, once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two.

Between 1926 and 1928, the Central London cars were converted to air-door operation and it had been planned to convert the Gate Stock on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. The cost of building a new car was only slightly more than the cost of converting an old one, and an order for new cars was placed. Delivered in 1929 and 1930, these vehicles enabled Gate Stock to be withdrawn from the Piccadilly line in June 1929. The last gate stock train ran on 1 January 1930. After 1929 the design was slightly altered with longer cars with wider doors and additional single-leaf doors on the trailers and electro-pneumatic brakes. Trains of this design were bought in 1931 and 1934 for the extensions of the Piccadilly line to South Harrow and Uxbridge, Hounslow and Cockfosters.

====London Passenger Transport Board====
The merger of London&#x27;s underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board (LTPB) was followed by the 1935–40 New Works Programme that included extension of the Bakerloo, Central and Northern lines. New trains were needed and four prototype six-car trains were built, three with streamlined cabs. Modern electrical equipment was fitted under the floor, removing the need for a control compartment on the motor cars, increasing the number of seats to 40. 1938 Stock, without the streamlining, entered service on the Northern line in June 1938. A seven-car train was formed from two trailer cars and five motor cars, one of which had no cab, the increased power giving greater acceleration. 

A total of 1,121 cars were built. By 1938 the Central line had been converted from the original 3-rail to the 4-rail system, the tunnels enlarged and platforms lengthened to take 8-car trains of the displaced Standard Stock, the last Central London Railway train running in 1939. In the same year Standard Stock replaced the 1904 Gate Stock on the isolated Northern City Line. The Bakerloo line received some 1938 Stock, these running with some converted trailers of Standard Stock. The Central line extensions were suspended during World War II and many Standard Stock cars were placed in store. These cars were in a poor state after the war and extensive refurbishment was needed when the extensions had been completed. After the war more trains were needed. With limited resources, 89 cars to the same design as the 1938 Stock (1949 Stock) were ordered and the pre-war streamlined prototypes were rebuilt. These were introduced on the Piccadilly line, releasing some Standard Stock to augment the trains on the Central line.

Three prototype aluminium-bodied seven-car trains were ordered in 1956, to be followed by 76 × 7-car trains of 1959 Stock. It was planned that these would be introduced on the Piccadilly line, allowing the later Standard Stock cars to be transferred to the Central line. However the Central line&#x27;s Standard Stock was proving troublesome and the trains were diverted to replace these trains, augmented with an extra car. A follow on order of 1962 Stock, as it became known, entered service on the Central line, releasing the 1959 Stock for the Piccadilly line. Standard Stock was withdrawn from the Central line in 1963 and Piccadilly line in 1964. 

Building the Victoria line had been recommended in a 1949 report, as it would reduce congestion on other lines. New trains were needed for the new line, and eight-car trains made up from two four-car units with two driving motors and two trailers were ordered in 1964. Trials of automatic train operation (ATO) were carried out on the District line in 1962–63, followed by longer term operation on the Central line on a shuttle service between Woodford and Hainault. Successful, the Victoria line was equipped with its 1967 Stock, and as the new trains arrived they spent three weeks working between Woodford and Hainault. The line opened to Victoria in stages in 1968–69 and extended to Brixton in 1971.

In the 1970s, the Piccadilly line was extended to Heathrow Airport. The Jubilee line was built under central London, taking over the Bakerloo line&#x27;s Stanmore branch at Baker Street. The isolated Northern City line was connected with the suburban railway at Finsbury Park. The Standard Stock trains had been replaced by 1938 Stock in 1966, and they last ran in the tunnels in 1975. A through main line service started in 1976 and the line transferred to British Rail. 

A new fleet of trains was to be built for the Piccadilly line, and its 1956–59 Stock was to replace the 1938 Stock trains elsewhere on the system. However, in 1970 the service on the Northern line was poor, with up to 40 services a day being cancelled due to its aging 1938 Stock and poor industrial relations at that time at Acton Works. The Northern line urgently needed newer trains and 30 more than would be available from the Piccadilly line. The first batch of 1972 Stock, known afterwards as Mk I stock, was ordered to fill this shortfall. Rapidly designed, this was the 1967 stock design adapted for operation with a driver and guard, entering service on the Northern line between 1972 and 1973.

The Jubilee line needed 33 trains and a second order of 1972 Stock, known as Mk II, was ordered. Entering service on the Northern line between 1973 and 1974, these differed from the Mk Is as it was planned to convert the line to ATO. These were transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1977. When the Jubilee line opened in 1979 it used the 1972 Mk II stock while the Bakerloo line had 36 trains of refurbished 1938 stock. The 1973 Stock ordered for the Piccadilly line was a new design. Instead of seven cars, the trains were composed of six cars, each about longer than the 1959 Stock cars. This allowed a symmetrical train with fewer cars and bogies. Space for luggage for passengers connecting with flights at Heathrow was left beside the doors, leaving 44 seats in each car.
Estimating that the remaining 1938 Stock needed replacement by 1984, in 1979 London Transport proposed building 33 trains for the Jubilee line, releasing its trains for use elsewhere on the system. After some negotiation 15 trains were ordered with an option for a further 13. The resulting 1983 Stock was a development of the 1973 Stock, with six of the longer cars, but with single leaf doors, similar to the D Stock that had been introduced on the District line. Trains entered service between 1984 and 1985, with each new delivery triggering a cascade with a 1972 Mk II moving to the Northern line, replacing a 1959 Stock that moved to the Bakerloo line, allowing a 1938 Stock train to be scrapped. In 1986 passenger numbers were increasing and a further trains of 1983 Stock were ordered. These entered service in 1987–88. 

After agreement about One Person Operation (OPO) was reached with the trade unions in 1983, work began converting trains and lines. The 1972 Mk II, 1973 and 1983 Stocks were able to be converted and guards were removed from trains on the Piccadilly line in 1987, the Jubilee line in 1988 and the Bakerloo line in 1989. The second order of 1983 stock and completion of the OPO stock conversions allowed the Jubilee line fleet to be made up of 1983 Stock and the Bakerloo line with 1972 Mk II Stock. Some 1972 Mk I stock cars were released to be converted to augment the Victoria line fleet, running in the middle of eight-car trains.

The signalling on the Central line needed replacement by the late 1980s. It was decided to bring forward the replacement of the 1962 Stock, due at about the same time as the 1959 Stock running on the Northern line. The signalling was to be replaced with an updated version of the ATO system then in used on the Victoria line, the line traction supply boosted and new trains built. Prototype trains were built with two double and two single doors hung on the outside of the train and electronic traction equipment that gave regenerative and rheostatic braking. The first 8 long car trains of 1992 Stock entered service in 1993. While the necessary signalling works for ATO were in progress, OPO was phased in from 1993–95. 

ATP was commissioned from 1995–97 and ATO from 1999–2001, with a centralised control centre in West London. A train refurbishment project was launched in July 1991, triggered by a new Fire Safety Code of Practice after the King&#x27;s Cross fire and to combat graffiti. The short Waterloo &amp; City line had been operated by the main line railways, and the original stock replaced in 1940. This stock was increasingly unreliable, with the line closing for two weeks in March 1989 and again in May 1991. Five 4-car trains of 1992 Stock were ordered by British Rail and these entered service in 1993. London Underground took over the line in 1994.

To allow the Jubilee line to be extended to Stratford, a new fleet of trains was ordered in 1992 to replace the 1983 Stock running on the line, as the cost of a new fleet was calculated to be the same as refurbishing the older trains to run with the newer trains. The result was the 1996 Stock, with the first train being delivered in 1996. On the Jubilee line a seventh car was added to trains at the end of 2005.

The Northern line stock needed replacement and the 1995 Stock replaced the mixture of 1959, 1962 and 1972 Mk I Stock trains that were used on the line, the first trains arriving in 1998. These trains are similar, composed of long cars with externally hung doors, but with differing traction equipment. OPO operation was introduced on the Northern line with the new trains. The last service with a guard operated on the London Underground in January 2000. A new signalling system allowing automatic operation was commissioned in 2011. 

On the Victoria line, new 2009 Stock trains were introduced between July 2009 and June 2011. A new signalling system and improvements to track work allowed for an increase to frequency of service to up to 36 trains per hour, the most frequent in the UK and one of the most frequent in Europe.

====Isle of Wight====
Although the Isle of Wight is approximately south of London, its railway has used tube trains since 1967. In the early 1960s it was proposed to close the island&#x27;s whole railway network, but the route from to was kept as buses could not cope with the summer holiday traffic. Updating the system was necessary, but tunnels on the island required rolling stock lower than the standard main line stock. The line was electrified and forty-three cars of Standard Stock were purchased by British Rail, delivered in the spring of 1967 and ready for that summer season. 

These trains were replaced in 1989 by 1938 Stock, refurbished and formed into two-car Class 483 units. In January 2021 the 1938 Stock was withdrawn from service. The line is currently (as at May 2021) undergoing engineering works (including platform height raising) to allow more recent London Underground D78 Stock to operate. These heavily refurbished train sets are known of as British Rail Class 484 and (after some delays caused by software issues) entered service in November 2021.

===Inter-car barriers===
All London Underground rolling stock has recently been modified to include inter-car safety barriers between the cars. These were first fitted to the D78 Stock and 1973 Stock in late 1997 to prevent passengers from boarding trains from in between the cars and to prevent drunk people from falling between cars and being seriously injured. They were fitted to the rest of the rolling stock in 2000. Unfortunately, this meant the mounting of blisters on the front ends of the C Stock as well as the double ended A Stock, D Stock, 1967 Stock and 1973 Stock in the case that the cabs were coupled in the middle of a train. They also became a maintenance problem and an operational inconvenience when coupling and uncoupling cars.

===Fire extinguishers===
All tube carriages originally had fire extinguishers located at the ends of the carriages. Between 1999 and 2001, all tube carriages had their fire extinguishers removed due to excessive violence and vandalism. Fire extinguishers were often used as weapons for attacks on passengers and staff which caused services to be disrupted and too much money had to be spent on replacing fire extinguishers. Their removal was criticised following the 1987 King&#x27;s Cross fire. Because of fires in tube carriages becoming very hard to start, following the train refurbishment program in the 1990s, it was decided that it was no longer cost-effective to replace stolen or damaged fire extinguishers. Their removal began on the Central line in 1999 and was completed by 2001. Fire extinguishers were instead installed in the driver&#x27;s cabs and on station platforms and were removed from tube carriages.

==Heritage vehicles==
Two steam locomotives survive, one A Class No. 23 (LT L45) at the London Transport Museum, and E Class No. 1 (LT L44) is preserved at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The Bluebell Railway has four 1898–1900 bogie carriages in running condition and a fifth is a static exhibit at the London Transport Museum. Also at the London Transport Museum is Metropolitan electric locomotive No. 5 &quot;John Hampden&quot;, City and South London electric locomotive and &quot;padded cell&quot; carriage, District Railway E/Q23 multiple unit car, and a 1938-tube stock car.

A preserved carriage at the Kent and East Sussex Railway was thought to be a District Railway first class, but now thought likely to be a cutdown Metropolitan Railway eight wheeler. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages. The Spa Valley Railway is home to two cars of T-Stock.

To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Metropolitan Railway special services ran in January 2013 using a restored 1892 &quot;Jubilee&quot; carriage, 1898–1900 bogie carriages, steam locomotive No. 1 and electric locomotive &quot;Sarah Siddons&quot;. Further events are planned in 2013 for Locomotive No. 1, &quot;Sarah Siddons&quot; and the Jubilee carriage, including a &quot;Steam back on the Met&quot; scheduled for May.

To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the District Railway the London Transport Museum are restoring a three-car Q Stock train to run on the District Line as special services during 2018.

==Engineering trains==
===Locomotives===
====Steam locomotives====
After the District Railway had electrified in 1907, it sold most of its locomotives. In 1925 two locomotives (No. 33 and No 34) remained for departmental use. In 1926 No. 33 was scrapped and replaced by Metropolitan Railway A Class No. 22, which became District No. 35. These were replaced in 1931 by two 0-6-0T goods locomotives bought from the Hunslet Engine Company. When they passed to London Transport in 1933, they were numbered L.30 and L.31. They were withdrawn in 1963. 

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was still using steam locomotives on passenger trains. The LNER took over responsibility for steam working in 1937 and LT kept eleven locomotives for departmental work. From 1956 these were replaced by ex-GWR 0-6-0PT pannier tanks, to be replaced by diesel-hydraulic locomotives in 1971.

In 1899 the Central London Railway had two tube-gauge steam locomotives that were oil fired underground and could run on coal above ground. They were sold by 1921.

====Battery-electric locomotives====

A fleet of 37 battery-electric locomotives are in service, able to take power from the electrified rails or from an on-board battery.

====Diesel locomotives====

A fleet of 4 diesel locomotives are currently used as shunting locomotives in Ruislip Depot due to growing restrictions on where they can operate on the network.

<text>The West Highland Line ( – &quot;Iron Road to the Isles&quot;) is a railway line linking the ports of Mallaig and Oban in the Scottish Highlands to Glasgow in Central Scotland. The line was voted the top rail journey in the world by readers of independent travel magazine &quot;Wanderlust&quot; in 2009, ahead of the notable Trans-Siberian line in Russia and the Cuzco to Machu Picchu line in Peru. The ScotRail website has since reported that the line has been voted the most scenic railway line in the world for the second year running.

The West Highland Line is one of two railway lines that access the remote and mountainous west coast of Scotland, the other being the Kyle of Lochalsh Line which connects Inverness with Kyle of Lochalsh. The line is the westernmost railway line in Great Britain.

At least in part, the West Highland Line is the same railway line as that referred to as the West Highland Railway.

==History==
The route was built in several sections:
*Glasgow Queen Street to Cowlairs Junction - Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway
*Cowlairs Junction to Bowling - Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway (later absorbed into the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway)
*Bowling to Dumbarton Central - Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway, operated by the Caledonian Railway
*Dumbarton Central to Dalreoch - Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway
*Dalreoch to Craigendoran - Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway
*Craigendoran to Fort William (opened 11 August 1894) - West Highland Railway sponsored by the North British Railway
*Crianlarich to Oban - Callander and Oban Railway, operated by the Caledonian Railway.

There is an additional section from Fort William (or a junction near Fort William) to Mallaig, built as the Mallaig Extension Railway. The West Highland Railway approved the construction of the line at their annual meeting in January 1895.

The line faced potential closure as part of the Beeching cuts in 1963 and again in 1995 due to reduced revenues.

==Route description==

Shortly after leaving Glasgow Queen Street station, and beyond Queen Street Tunnel, the line diverges from the main trunk route to and at and follows a northwesterly course through the suburbs of Maryhill and Kelvindale. Between and Dumbarton, the route is shared with the North Clyde Line to before branching northward at Craigendoran Junction towards , the section where the West Highland Line itself is generally accepted to begin. It gives high-level views of the Gare Loch and Loch Long before emerging alongside the northwesterly shores of Loch Lomond, then climbs to .
The branch to Oban diverges at Crianlarich, an important Highland junction of both road and rail, and runs through Glen Lochy to and through the Pass of Brander to reach salt water at and before a final climb over a hill to . About from Crianlarich, the Mallaig and Oban routes both pass through the village of Tyndrum, but they are served by separate stations, making it the smallest settlement in the UK to be served by more than one railway station.

After , the line to Mallaig climbs onto Rannoch Moor, past the former crossing point at Gorton Crossing to station. In winter, the moor is often covered with snow, and deer may be seen running from the approaching train. The station at on the moor is one of the most remote stations in Britain and is not accessible by any public road. This is the summit of the line at 1347 ft (410 m) above sea level. Carrying on northwards, the line descends above the shores of Loch Treig and through the narrow Monessie Gorge. The final stop before Fort William is . The section between Fort William and Mallaig passes over the Glenfinnan Viaduct, through Arisaig with its views of the Small Isles of Rùm, Eigg, Muck and Canna, and the white sands of Morar before coming to Mallaig itself.

With the exception of the route between Glasgow Queen Street and Helensburgh Upper, and the short section between Fort William Junction and Fort William station, the railway is signalled using the Radio Electronic Token Block, controlled from the signal box at Banavie station.

==Services==
Passenger services on the line are operated by ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper. As of May 2021, the service pattern is as follows:

* 3tpd each way Mallaig - 
* 1tpd each way Mallaig - 
* 1tpd Oban - Dalmally
* 6tpd each way Oban - Glasgow Queen Street. Additionally, 1tpd Glasgow Queen Street - Oban (one way only)

All of the services from Glasgow Queen Street - Mallaig are combined with services to Oban, splitting at Crianlarich. Similarly, two of the return services combine at Crianlarich.

During the summer season from May until October a steam locomotive-hauled daily return service between Fort William and Mallaig known as &quot;The Jacobite&quot; is operated by West Coast Railways. There is one train a day in May, September and October, and two trains per day from June until the end of August.

Caledonian Sleeper operates a nightly service from Fort William to London Euston.

Onward ferry connections operated by Caledonian MacBrayne are available from Mallaig to the Isle of Skye, to the small isles of Rùm, Eigg, Muck, and Canna, to South Uist, and to Inverie on the Knoydart peninsula. From Oban ferries sail to the islands of Lismore, Colonsay, Coll, Tiree, Mull and Barra.

As of 2021, there is a single regular freight operation on the line, consisting of alumina services from North Blyth to a smelter near Fort William.

==Route timings==
Since improvements to Scottish trunk roads in the 1980s, a train journey can take significantly longer than the equivalent road journey. There are several reasons for this. The line is entirely single track once it leaves the North Clyde suburban network at and trains must wait at stations with crossing loops for opposite direction trains to pass. Even when no crossing is timetabled, each train must pause at the various token exchange points whilst the driver contacts the main signalling centre at to swap tokens electronically and obtain permission to proceed. Up to 15 minutes have to be allocated for trains to divide or combine at the junction station at , whilst trains heading to/from Mallaig also have to reverse at Fort William &amp; traverse the Banavie swing bridge at low speed. A further issue is finding suitable timetable paths for Oban &amp; Mallaig trains on the busy North Clyde line, which carries an intensive local stopping service. As West Highland trains only stop at Dumbarton Central and Dalmuir on this stretch, it is not uncommon for them be delayed by a preceding local train and so recovery time has to be included in their schedules to reduce the possibility of a late arrival in Glasgow. 

Over much of the Rannoch Moor section the speed limit is for the Sprinter and on the approach to Rannoch station. The Caledonian Sleeper travels at maximum, slowing down for a number of bridges on the route due to the heavy weight of the locomotive which hauled the train until the end of the old franchise in April 2015. The operator of the sleeper Serco has replaced these with refurbished electro-diesels since it took over, which have a lighter axle load; it is not yet clear whether the new locomotives will be cleared to run at higher speeds now they are in service.

== Rolling stock ==
In early 2018 it was widely reported that would be used from Q3-Q4 2018 to replace the Class 156s. However, following investigation it was discovered that the line does not have sufficient gauge clearance for the class. studies were still ongoing.

==Some notable railway-related features==

* The Horse Shoe Curve, between and 
* The Cruach Rock snowshed, between and 
* Glenfinnan Viaduct, between and 
* The Pass of Brander stone signals, between and 
* is the most westerly railway station in Great Britain

The two branches of the line are described in detail by John Thomas in his two books (see Sources).

==The route in detail==

Places served along the route from Glasgow Queen Street are listed below. Sleeper services to Fort William start, however, at London Euston, calling at and Queen Street Low Level (to pick up or set down depending on direction).

== West Highland Line in film ==
* Glenfinnan Viaduct, on the line between Fort William and Mallaig, is a filming location for the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter series of films.
* Eddie McConnell&#x27;s poetic documentary &quot;A Line for All Seasons&quot; (1970) showcases the line and its history set against the scenery of the western highlands as it changes through the seasons.
* features in &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996), directed by Danny Boyle.

==Museum==
There is a museum dedicated to the history of the West Highland Line situated at Glenfinnan station.

== Future ==
In the Scottish Government&#x27;s National Transport Strategy, published in February 2020, it was stated that the line will not be electrified with overhead lines. Instead, an alternative to diesel traction will be found.

<doc id="1132175" wikidata="Q7338331" url="?curid=1132175" title="Rivers of Kent">
<text>Four major rivers drain the county of Kent, England.

== River Medway ==

The catchment area of the Medway covers almost 25% of the county. The detailed map has a diagram of that catchment area, which includes its main tributaries: the rivers Eden, Bourne (or Shode), Teise, Beult, Loose and Len.

=== Tributaries of the River Medway ===
*The River Eden
*River Grom
*The River Bourne begins its course west of Oldbury Hill on the Greensand Ridge in the parish of Ightham and enters the Medway upstream of East Peckham, near Tonbridge.
*The River Teise (pronounced &quot;tice&quot; or &quot;teeze&quot;) begins in Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and flows eastwards through Lamberhurst, passing Bayham Abbey. Here the small River Bewl, on which is the reservoir Bewl Water, joins the Teise. The Teise bifurcates 2 km SW of Marden, the minor stream flows directly to Twyford Bridge, Yalding, while the major stream joins the River Beult at Hunton, 1.5 km above Yalding.
*The River Beult (pronounced &quot;belt&quot;) has its several sources west of Ashford, and then flows through Headcorn and where it is joined by the major stream of the Teise. The river enters the Medway at Yalding.
*Wateringbury Stream rises at West Peckham, flows south east towards Mereworth and then flows in a generally easterly direction to join the Medway at Wateringbury. It is some four miles (6 km) long and until the 20th century powered several watermills.
*The River Loose is a relatively short river starting near Langley south east of Maidstone running west through Loose and joining the Medway at Tovil.
*The River Len has its source at a small watershed south of Lenham. A nearby stream is one of the sources of the Great Stour. The Len flows in a westerly direction and joins the Medway at Maidstone.

== River Stour ==

The River Stour is also known as the Great Stour, especially above its confluence with the Little Stour at Plucks Gutter. Its catchment area covers the eastern part of Kent.

=== Tributaries of the River Stour ===

*East Stour - rising near Hythe to Ashford.
*Little Stour - north of Hythe to join the Great Stour at Plucks Gutter, north west of Canterbury.
*River Wantsum - part of the old Wantsum Channel separating the Isle of Thanet from Kent.
*Whitewater Dyke - running from Shadoxhurst to Ashford
*Ruckinge Dyke - from north of Hamstreet to Ashford
*Aylesford Stream - its source is north of Sevington to Willesborough

== River Darent ==

Its tributary is the River Cray.

==River Dour==

A minor river from Temple Ewell to Dover

== River Rother ==

A Wealden river. It is included here since for part of its journey near Bodiam it forms the boundary between Kent and East Sussex.

<text>Newzbin was a British Usenet indexing website, intended to facilitate access to content on Usenet. The site caused controversy over its stance on copyrighted material. Access to the Newzbin.com website was blocked by BT and Sky in late 2011, following legal action in the UK by Hollywood film studios.

The site announced that it had closed down on 28 November 2012.

==Features==
Newzbin indexed binary files that had been posted on Usenet, and offered the results through a search engine, with categories that included &quot;Movies&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Apps&quot; and &quot;Books&quot;. The site created NZB files, which allowed the files to be downloaded with a suitable newsreader. NZB files are similar to torrent files, as they do not contain the file itself, but information about the location of the file to be downloaded. The search results could be browsed free of charge after creating a user account, but access to the NZB files was restricted to premium members who paid a subscription.

==2010 legal action from Hollywood studios==
In February and March 2010, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Paramount Pictures Corporation, Disney Enterprises, Inc. and Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. took joint legal action against Newzbin in the High Court in London, arguing that the site was encouraging widespread copyright infringement by indexing unofficial copies of films on Usenet.

In March 2010, Mr. Justice Kitchin ruled that Newzbin was deliberately indexing copyrighted content, observing that Newzbin had a &quot;sophisticated and substantial infrastructure and in the region of 700,000 members, though not all premium&quot;, and that &quot;for the year ended 31 December 2009, it had a turnover in excess of £1million, a profit in excess of £360,000 and paid dividends on ordinary shares of £415,000&quot;. Chris Elsworth, the main operator of Newzbin, had said repeatedly during the case that he had no knowledge of infringement occurring on the service, and that Newzbin&#x27;s categories for &quot;CAM,&quot; &quot;screener,&quot; &quot;telesync,&quot; &quot;DVD&quot;, &quot;R5 retail&quot;, &quot;Blu-ray,&quot; and &quot;HD DVD&quot; did not suggest any evidence of infringement. Kitchin was critical of Elsworth, stating that his evidence disputing the claim that the site&#x27;s features did not encourage copyright infringement was &quot;simply not credible&quot;.

On 18 May 2010, the Newzbin.com site was temporarily shut down, displaying the message &quot;Regrettably the Newzbin website has to close as a result of the legal action against us.&quot;

By 2 June 2010, Newzbin was back online, under the name Newzbin2, but using the same code and database as its predecessor, and hosted in the Seychelles.

==2011 legal action and ISP site blocking==
In June 2011, the Motion Picture Association applied for an injunction to force BT, the largest Internet service provider in the United Kingdom, to cut off customers&#x27; access to Newzbin. On 28 July 2011, the High Court ruled that BT had to block access to Newzbin, using Cleanfeed. BT announced that it would not appeal against the ruling. The Open Rights Group was critical of the decision, saying that it could set a &quot;dangerous&quot; precedent.

In September 2011, Newzbin released client software which aimed to circumvent the BT blocking.

On 26 October 2011 at the High Court, Mr. Justice Arnold ordered BT to block its estimated six million customers&#x27; access to the website Newzbin2 within fourteen days, the first ruling of its kind under UK copyright law. Attempts to access the site from a BT IP address were met by the message &quot;Error – site blocked&quot;. Newzbin claimed that the block was ineffective, and that 93.5% of its active UK users had downloaded its workaround software. A study suggested that the workaround involved encryption to hide communication between users and Newzbin2, including the use of the Tor network.

Sky blocked access to Newzbin, stating: &quot;We have received a court order requiring us to block access to this illegal website, which we did on 13th December, 2011.&quot;

==2012==
On 26 January 2012, barrister David Harris, who had represented Newzbin during part of the 2010 High Court case, was disbarred after it emerged that 100% of the site&#x27;s issued share capital was held in his name. He was also fined £2,500 after tweeting as &quot;@Geeklawyer&quot;, describing opposing lawyers with the words &quot;slimebags&quot; and &quot;prick&quot;.

In February 2012, the Newzbin.com domain closed down, and the site moved to Newzbin2.es.

On 13 August 2012, Virgin Media blocked access to the site.

===Closedown===
On 28 November 2012, Newzbin2.es announced the closure of its indexing service, displaying to visitors the following text on its main page:

===December 2012 court action against former Newzbin directors===

On 20 December 2012 at the High Court in London, Mr Justice Newey ruled that the film studios involved in the legal action against Newzbin did not have a proprietary claim to money derived from infringement of copyright. The studios had taken action against David Harris and Chris Elsworth, two of the former directors of the company.

<text>Frank James Prewett (August 24, 1893 – February 16, 1962) was a Canadian poet who spent most of his life in the United Kingdom. He was a war poet of the First World War and was taken up by Siegfried Sassoon, but after a period of being lionised socially he led a mainly unsatisfactory life, suffering from bad health.

He was born near Mount Forest, Ontario, and brought up on a farm near Kenilworth, Ontario. In 1915 he left his studies at the University of Toronto and enlisted as a private in the Canadian Army. Later he was offered and accepted a commission in the British Army, serving in the Royal Field Artillery. He served in France, but was invalided out in 1917 after being injured twice, once having to claw his way out of the earth after being buried alive. While he was recovering from shell shock in a psychiatric hospital in 1918 he began pretending to be an Iroquois called Toronto. This was accepted at the time, but was later questioned, and ultimately disproved by DNA analysis, which found no genetic connection to Iroquois. The claim has been attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder.

At Lennel Auxiliary Hospital, a sister hospital to Craiglockhart War Hospital, he met Sassoon, who later wrote a brief portrait of him in his autobiography, &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Journey&quot;. Sassoon introduced him to Lady Ottoline Morrell and he stayed at Garsington, her estate, while he awaited repatriation to Canada. Prewett later maintained a regular correspondence with Lady Ottoline (Darroch 215) and when he returned to England he was offered a job at Garsington, but &quot;he fell under suspicion of keeping back farm earnings&quot; (Darroch, 233) and was asked to leave.

Prewett had an academic job at an agricultural research institute from the mid-1920s to 1934. He married Madeline Vera Clinkard in 1925, but the marriage failed. On Sassoon&#x27;s evidence, he suffered from clinical depression.

His poems were recognised by the inclusion of some of them in the final &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; anthology and in &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;, and by publication by the Hogarth Press; followed by a collection &quot;The Rural Scene&quot; in 1922. In the 1930s he was a BBC broadcaster and did editorial work. A historical novel set in Berkshire in the times of Captain Swing, &quot;The Chazzey Tragedy&quot; (1933), made little impact. He was married again, to Dorothy Agnes Pollard, who was a colleague on the editorial staff of &quot;The Countryman&quot;, the magazine where he was working.

During the Second World War he served in the RAF, and he stayed on in the Air Ministry until 1954. Retiring because of poor health, he farmed near Abingdon until his death in Inverness.

Robert Graves, a friend from Oxford days, edited his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, published in 1964. Graves&#x27;s introduction provides the longest printed account of Prewett&#x27;s life available. A volume of &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published in 1987.

<doc id="1132190" wikidata="Q470996" url="?curid=1132190" title="Charlie Simpson">
<text>Charles Robert Simpson (born 7 June 1985) is an English singer, songwriter, and musician from Suffolk. He is a member of the BRIT Award winning pop-punk band Busted and he is also lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist in the post-hardcore band Fightstar. AllMusic has noted that Simpson is &quot;perhaps the only pop star to make the convincing transition from fresh-faced boy bander to authentic hard rock frontman&quot;. Simpson is a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, bass, keyboard, piano and drums.

Simpson has achieved eleven UK Albums Chart top-40 releases across his musical career, six of which entered the UK top 10. He has also had four number-one singles with Busted and a number-one album, as well as two top-20 singles with Fightstar and two UK top-10 solo albums. Between Busted, Fightstar and his solo projects, he has sold over five million records worldwide, winning two Brit Awards and being nominated for two Kerrang! Awards.

==Early life and family==
The youngest of three boys, Simpson was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk. He has two brothers, Will (born 1980) and Edd (born 1981). Will is the vocalist and guitarist in Brigade, and Edd is the lead singer and guitarist in an alternative band called Union Sound Set. Simpson&#x27;s musical maternal heritage dates back to Sir William Sterndale Bennett, who was a notable 19th century English pianist, conductor, and composer.

Simpson was educated at Brandeston Hall Prep School in Suffolk and then at Uppingham School, where his great-grandfather, Robert Sterndale Bennett (1880–1963), had been a Director of Music between 1908 and 1945.

==Career==

===Busted (2002–2005; 2015–present)===
Simpson first gained fame with pop rock/pop punk act Busted as a result of responding to an advertisement placed by Matt Willis and James Bourne in &quot;NME&quot; magazine in 2001. Busted consisted of Simpson on lead guitar and occasionally drums, Willis on bass guitar and Bourne on rhythm guitar and piano; all three members provided vocals. Over a period of two years, the trio had major success and sold over 5 million records, won two BRIT Awards, and also won Record of The Year in 2004.

Simpson left Busted in 2005 to concentrate on post-hardcore band Fightstar.

On 10 November 2015 Busted announced they would be reforming with Simpson back in the original line-up and would embark on an 18 date arena tour around the UK and Ireland. The band sold 100,000 tickets in the first hour of the tour going on sale. Busted&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Night Driver&quot; was released in November 2016. In 2018, Busted announced their fourth album &quot;Half Way There&quot;, along with arena tour dates in March 2019. 

After another four year hiatus, whilst the band focused on other projects, in May 2023 Busted announced they would be returning for a 20 Year Anniversary Greatest Hits tour, which went on to become the biggest selling UK arena tour of 2023. They also released a Greatest Hits album which went to number 1 in the UK album charts.

===Fightstar (2003–present)===

Despite the huge success of Busted, Simpson began to grow increasingly discontented with the pop star lifestyle and the music he was performing. As an avid fan of rock music, he felt unfulfilled by the commercial pop songs of Busted.

He met Alex Westaway in late 2003, forming what became Fightstar shortly afterwards. For over a year he would lead a secret &quot;double life&quot;: by night he would attend rehearsal sessions with his new band after completing obligated media work and concert performances with Busted. During 2004, he and Westaway wrote Fightstar&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;They Liked You Better When You Were Dead&quot;. The EP showcased a heavier post-hardcore influenced sound that differed greatly to Busted&#x27;s material. The EP was recorded during November with Mark Williams in London. During this time, speculation began to grow about Busted&#x27;s future. He announced he was leaving Busted to pursue his career full-time with Fightstar in January 2005.

Simpson then funded and put together a compilation album called &quot;The Suffolk Explosion&quot;, which was released through his own label Sandwich Leg Records. It showcased a number of unsigned bands from Charlie&#x27;s home county of Suffolk, including Brigade and Prego, as well as a solo acoustic track written by him called &quot;Carry Her&quot;. 

Fightstar went on to record their debut full-length studio album with rock producer Colin Richardson. &quot;Grand Unification&quot; was released on 13 March 2006, and further proved the initial cynics wrong by receiving widespread positive reviews. In particular, Paul Brannigan of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine stated the album was &quot;one of the best British rock albums of the past decade&quot;. Scottish music publication &quot;The Fly&quot; also lauded the album as &quot;one of the 21st Century&#x27;s ultimate rock debuts&quot;. Shortly afterwards, the band went on to receive nominations at the Kerrang! Awards for &quot;Best British Newcomer&quot; and &quot;Best British Band&quot;. After leaving Island Records due to a disagreement over the band&#x27;s artistic direction, the band signed to an independent label called Institute Records which was a division of Gut Records to release their second album. &quot;One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours&quot; (2007), peaked at No. 27 on the UK Album Chart, before releasing a B-sides compilation album titled &quot;Alternate Endings&quot; (2008). The four-piece then funded and co-produced their third album, &quot;Be Human&quot; (2009). Fightstar released their fourth full length album &quot;Behind The Devils Back&quot; (2015), which would be their most critically acclaimed album, making Rock Sound magazine&#x27;s Top 50 Albums list for 2015.

On 6 November 2023, Fightstar announced they would be returning for a headline show at Wembley Arena to mark the band&#x27;s twenty year anniversary.

===Solo career (2010–present)===
On 29 July 2009, he made a Myspace page for his acoustic solo work. There were three songs on the page, &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, &quot;Empty Guns (Demo)&quot;, and &quot;Carry Her&quot;. &quot;Carry Her&quot; was previously available on &quot;The Suffolk Explosion&quot;.

Fightstar announced a hiatus at the beginning of 2010, stating that they were &quot;taking some time off&quot; for the remainder of 2010–11 to work on separate projects before regrouping in 2012 to begin working a new record.
Simpson has started working on a solo acoustic album, while Westaway and Haigh will be completing post-production on the bands film and working on some music videos.

Simpson went into the studio in June 2010 to start recording his full-length debut album with producer Danton Supple, whose previous work includes Coldplay and The Cure. The album was funded through PledgeMusic and as one of the main incentives for the campaign, fans received an EP called &quot;When We Were Lions&quot; on Christmas Day 2010. The full-length album was finally finished in February 2011 and was mastered by John Davis at Metropolis Studios in London. The first single to be taken from the album was called &quot;Down Down Down&quot; and it had its first radio airplay on 11 April, as Radio 1 DJ Fearne Cotton&#x27;s Record of the Week. The single was officially released on 16 May, though it was made available to buy on iTunes straight away. The album, titled &quot;Young Pilgrim&quot; was released on 15 August 2011. It went straight into the UK album chart at number 6, having been at number 5 in the midweeks. Simpson signed to PIAS Records in Germany and the album was released in Europe in August 2012.

On 2 February 2013, it was reported that Simpson had finished writing the follow-up to his 2011 solo debut &#x27;Young Pilgrim&#x27; and he would be heading into the studio with producer Steve Osbourne (U2/Placebo) to start recording in early March.

Simpson spent the summer of 2013 playing on the Vans Warped Tour in the US, which was the first time he has played live as a solo artist in America. During October 2013, Charlie went on a tour of the UK supporting rock band, Deaf Havana. He previewed two new tracks from the forthcoming album &quot;Winter Hymns&quot; and &quot;Ten More Days&quot;. In 2014, he undertook a small run of solo shows in the UK in the lead up to the release of his second solo album.

Simpson announced on 28 April 2014 that his second solo album is to be called &quot;Long Road Home&quot; and will be released later that year, since revealing the release date would be 4 August 2014. 

In October 2014, Simpson announced that he would play a 13 date UK solo acoustic tour in January/February of the following year.

On 5 May 2016, Simpson released his third solo album, &quot;Little Hands&quot;, a compilation of rare tracks from 2010 though 2016. The first single was a stripped-down version of &quot;Emily&quot;. The album also included the track from the Watch UKTV series &quot;Singing In the Rainforest&quot;, &quot;Walking With the San&quot;, which first aired in 2015. The song was recorded as part of the show in which Charlie travelled to Namibia to spend time living and playing music with the San people. After the show aired, an edit was made to act as a music video for the song and was uploaded to Facebook, the track has since gone viral and has been viewed over 14,000,000 times.

On 23 October 2020, Simpson released the first track from his upcoming album &quot;I See You&quot;, which peaked at 39 on the iTunes chart in its first week. In late 2021, Simpson announced his fourth album &quot;Hope Is A Drug&quot; would be released in March 2022. He announced a planned Hope Is A Drug tour.
The tour was later postponed citing delays to album supply chains and shipping caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

===Other works===

In 2015, Simpson released an EP with a side project called Once Upon a Dead Man alongside his two brothers Will and Edd Simpson, and friend Simon Britcliff.

Outside of his main musical activities, Simpson also has frequently collaborated with other musicians, which include This Is Menace, Gunship (the side project of his Fightstar bandmates, Alex Westaway and Dan Haigh) as well as indie band, The Travis Waltons. With Gunship, he co-wrote and lent his voice for their highly critical acclaimed single, &quot;Tech Noir&quot;, of Gunship&#x27;s debut album. In 2018, he contributed to Bullet for My Valentine&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Gravity&quot;, receiving a songwriting credit on the track &quot;Breathe Underwater&quot;. He also co-wrote the song Can&#x27;t Escape The Waves on Bullet For My Valentine&#x27;s 2022 self titled album.

Charlie has also been involved in film scoring, stating in an interview that this was something he was keen to pursue later in his career. He wrote the score for an independent British film &#x27;Everyone&#x27;s Going To Die&#x27;, which debuted at the SXSW Film Festival in March 2013.

In 2023, Simpson won the fourth series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Rhino&quot;, making him the first male winner in the UK. After his victory, he released the EP &quot;Kifaru&quot; containing songs he performed on &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

In 2023, Simpson appeared on Gunship&#x27;s third album &quot;Unicorn&quot;, lending his voice to &quot;Tech Noir 2&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Tech Noir&quot; from the first album. with film director John Carpenter and Tim Cappello from Tina Turner (1939–2023) and the film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; (1987) on Saxophone. In 2024, Simpson was cast as The Sung Thoughts of the Journalist in The Spirit of Man tour of &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;.

==Personal life==

Simpson married his long-time girlfriend Anna Barnard in June 2014, following the announcement of their engagement the week earlier. During a show on his 2015 UK Tour at London&#x27;s Islington Assembly Hall, Simpson announced that he and his wife were expecting their first child together. On 21 July that year, Simpson&#x27;s wife gave birth to their first son, Arlo Simpson. In February 2018, their second son, Jago, was born.

In 2004, Simpson was quoted in &quot;Tatler&quot; magazine as saying he supported the Conservative Party, stating that he&#x27;d &quot;grown up with their views&quot; and &quot;way of doing things&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Simpson &quot;was pilloried just like Phil Collins and Geri Halliwell before him&quot;. He later denied a political allegiance to the Conservatives, saying, &quot;The Tory thing is complete bulls--t! It came out of Matt&#x27;s mouth in an interview taking the complete p--s, and it was on the front cover of a newspaper. He was like laughing when he said it. Matt&#x27;s Labour! He said something like, &#x27;Now I&#x27;ve got loads of money I&#x27;m a f--king Tory boy,&#x27; laughing.&quot;

<doc id="1132196" wikidata="Q484151" url="?curid=1132196" title="Chiba Lotte Marines">
<text>The are a professional baseball team in Japan&#x27;s Pacific League based in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture, in the Kantō region, and owned by Lotte Holdings Co., Ltd. The Marines were a founding member of the Pacific League in as the Mainichi Orions when the Japanese Baseball League reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball, where they won the inaugural 1950 Japan Series. Since 1992, the Marines&#x27; home ballpark has been ZOZO Marine Stadium, located in the Mihama Ward of Chiba, seating 30,118 people.

The &quot;Marines&quot; name originates from the name of the team&#x27;s home stadium, which is officially named &quot;Chiba Marine Stadium&quot;, because the stadium is located right on the water.

Through 2024, the franchise&#x27;s all-time record is 4874-4844-405 (.502).

==History==
The Marines franchise began in 1950 as the Mainichi Orions, an inaugural member of the Pacific League, and were owned by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. The Orions were named after the constellation of the same name. The Marines won the inaugural Japan Series in 1950.

In 1958, the team was merged with the Daiei Unions and renamed the Daimai Orions, to reflect that both Daiei and Mainichi had a 50% stake in the team, with control being given to Daiei Film president Masaichi Nagata. In 1964 they became the Tokyo Orions, and the Lotte Orions in 1969. The franchise was slow to replicate its initial success: the Orions made the Japan Series in 1960 and 1970, only to lose both years.

The team played in central Tokyo until 1972. From 1973 to 1977 the Lotte Orions played in the northern Japanese city of Sendai. In 1974, they beat the Chunichi Dragons, becoming the first Pacific League team to win the Series in ten years, as the Yomiuri Giants had claimed the prior nine titles behind the Oh–Nagashima attack. After beating the Dragons, their owners, Lotte Holdings, decided to hold their victory parade in Tokyo, which shocked fans in Sendai. This eventually caused their attendance there to crash, going from sold-out games in 1973, to only about 2,000–3,000 attendees for their last few years in Sendai.

In 1977, the Orions signed Major League Baseball player Leron Lee, who ended up playing for the team for eleven seasons, compiling a .320 career batting average and slugging 283 home runs with 912 career RBI. From his retirement to early 2018 (when surpassed by Norichika Aoki), Lee held the Japanese record for career batting average (players with more than 4,000 at bats). In 1978, Lee invited younger brother Leon Lee to play in Japan, and the brothers formed a feared cleanup for the Orions for five seasons — in 1980, Leron had 33 home runs, 90 RBI, and a batting average of .358; while Leon slugged 41 home runs and drove in 116 runs, with a batting average of .340.

In 1978 the team returned to the Tokyo area, settling in Kawasaki&#x27;s Kawasaki Stadium, at one time home to the Taiyo Whales (today&#x27;s Yokohama DeNA Baystars).

In 1992, the team moved to Chiba City&#x27;s Chiba Marine Stadium on the eastern shore of Tokyo Bay. They held a fan vote for a new name for the team; the name &quot;Dolphins&quot; won, while another popular choice was &quot;Pirates&quot;. However, the name &quot;Dolphins&quot; was thrown out because though an unrelated team named the Nagoya Golden Dolphins (later known as Nagoya Kinko) was long defunct, the letter &quot;D&quot; in broadcasts was already taken by the Dragons; while &quot;Pirates&quot; was disregarded because the Chiba Pirates name was used by a team in , and since the team in that manga is terrible, executives didn&#x27;t want the team to be associated by a team that was supposed to be awful, supported by the fact that by then, the Orions had finished their 6th consecutive losing season, finishing in 6th in 3 of the last 4 seasons, alongside the fact that they were unsure if they could even use it to begin with, due to Japanese copyright laws. &quot;Marines&quot; was ultimately chosen because the team believed it meant &quot;heroes of the sea&quot; (and because the letter &quot;M&quot; was available), yielding the club name Chiba Lotte Marines. Originally, the club used pink, blue, and white on their logo, which included a pirate ship, with a seagull below it, and a wave pattern to reflect the ocean currents off Chiba&#x27;s coast. In 1995, this was changed to the logo&#x27;s current design, while dropping pink and blue in favor of red, black and white (with red being dropped in 2019). The current logo&#x27;s design features a baseball in the background with a seagull soaring, with the club&#x27;s name around the circle.

The team failed to reach the Japan Series again until 2005. The Marines started the 2005 season in first place behind American manager Bobby Valentine, who had returned after having managed the team to a 2nd place finish in 1995 behind the Orix BlueWave, but struggles between him and general manager Tatsuro Hirooka had him leave after that lone season, but fell behind the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks as the year progressed. Under the playoff format of the time, the preliminary five-game playoff round, prior to the Japan Series, saw the teams with the best first and second half records face off. The Marines defeated the Hawks three games to two in the Pacific League championship, winning the rubber match despite entering the eighth inning trailing, 2–1.

The Marines thus qualified for the Japan Series, the first time they had reached the tournament since 1974, a 31-year drought. In a one-sided series, the Marines swept the Hanshin Tigers in four games, scoring ten runs in each of the first three games. The apparent ease with which the Marines defeated the Tigers added fuel to the ongoing debate concerning the need for a playoff system in the Central League, which was finally added in 2007 (see Climax Series). The Marines went on to defeat South Korea&#x27;s Samsung Lions in the final round of the Konami Cup Championships.

In 2010, the Marines clinched third place on the last day of the season to earn a berth into the Climax Series. They went on to become the first third place team to ever win the Climax Series, and faced off with the Chunichi Dragons in the 2010 Japan Series. The Marines defeated the Dragons in seven games, composed of four wins, two losses, and one tie, winning their second Japan Series in under ten years.

In 2013, the Marines clinched third place to clinch a berth in the Climax Series and faced the Saitama Seibu Lions in the first stage. They defeated the Lions in 3 games to move onto the final stage. They would lose to the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in 5 games, who would go on and defeat the Yomiuri Giants in 7 games to win their first (and still only) Japan Series title.

They would make it back in the playoffs in 2015. They defeated the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in 3 games in the first round, then got swept by the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, who received a one game advantage for having the best record in the Pacific League.

The following season, they returned to the playoffs. They would make a much earlier exit, as they were swept by the Hawks in 2 games in the first stage.

It would not be until 2020 when they returned to the playoffs. The Hawks, with a 1 game advantage, would sweep them again in the first stage.

They bounced back the following year by defeating the Eagles in 2 games in the first stage, including a tie in the second game which allowed them to advance as they had the better record at 67-57-19, while the Eagles had a 66-62-15 record. They got swept by the Orix Buffaloes in the final stage in 3 games, however a tie in the third game and Orix having the better record at 70-55-18, allowed the Buffaloes to advance.

On April 10, 2022, Rōki Sasaki threw a perfect game, NPB&#x27;s first in 28 years and the 16th in NPB history. Sasaki tied an existing NPB record by striking out 19 batters, and setting a new record by striking out 13 consecutive batters. It didn&#x27;t do much to help the season, as the Marines finished in 5th place with a 69-73-1 record, and Tadahito Iguchi would be let go after that season, replaced by Masato Yoshii.

The Marines would edge out the Hawks and Eagles in a close playoff race in 2023, finishing 2nd with a 70-68-5 record. They would defeat the Hawks in 3 games in the first stage, but lost in 5 games to the Buffaloes in the final stage, who also had a 1-win advantage for having the best record in Pacific League. That season would be the last for ZOZO Marine Stadium public address announcer Emi Taniho. Originally, she was given a farewell ceremony on October 7, 2023, her supposed last home game, which included many former Marines players, but she was given extended duty, as the Marines were appearing to make a run for the Climax Series. That game was also her 2,100th game announcing. Her actual last day with the team was on December 20.

===Honored number===

* 26 – This number was retired in honor of the Marines&#x27; fans in 2005. It was inspired by some teams in other sports (such as football, which retires &quot;12&quot; for the &quot;12th man&quot;, or basketball, which retires &quot;6&quot; for the &quot;6th man&quot;).The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles has the No. 10 retired in similar fashion. MLB&#x27;s Los Angeles Angels has retired No. 26, in same fashion, for the founder Gene Autry.

== Managers ==
* Statistics current through the end of the season.

== Cheer dancers ==
The Marines&#x27; cheer dancing squad is known as M☆Splash!!. They were formed in 2004. Alongside the team&#x27;s mascots Mar-kun, Rine-chan and Zu-chan, they entertain the crowd during Marines games, with 27 members.

==Mascots==
Mar-kun (マーくん, &quot;Maa-kun&quot;) is a main mascot character of the Marines. With his girlfriend Rine-chan (リーンちゃん, &quot;Riin-chan&quot;) and his young brother Zu-chan (ズーちゃん, &quot;Zuu-chan&quot;), he entertains spectators at team games. Their name is a separateness of the team name. Originally Rine-chan wore a pink sports visor cap till the 2022 season when she wore the same baseball cap as her boyfriend while retaining the skirt, while Zu-chan wears the cap backwards and wears an apron instead of the jersey beginning 2022, before that he wore a shirt unless all three wear their team&#x27;s special home uniforms.

Mysterious fish (謎の魚, &quot;Nazo-no-sakana&quot;) was a mascot character that was introduced in May 2017. He is a weird fish with legs. He has collaborated with Hawaiian Airlines that former Marines&#x27; player Benny Agbayani works for, since 2018. However, the person playing the mascot announced after the 2021 season that he would retire, which also meant the mascot was officially retired.

Back when the team were known as the &quot;Lotte Orions&quot;, their mascot was a character known simply as Bubble-Boy (バブル坊や, &quot;Bable-Boya&quot;) who only appeared as a logo.

In 2005, the Marines introduced a mascot named Cool-kun ( かっこいいくん, &quot;Kakkoi-kun&quot;), a penguin who was known for his acrobatic stunts and would often challenge mascots like Doala and B.B to acrobatic stunt contests at rival games. He also would be stuck up and rude at times, but he would burst to tears or show great emotion at the right time. Despite being friends with Mar-kun, they do not get along very well. In 2016, he was retired by the team.

== Minor League team== 
The Marines farm team plays in the Eastern League. The team was founded as the Mainichi Glitter Orions in 1950.

<text>Atiglio Leoni Politi (November 21, 1908 – March 26, 1996) was an American artist and author who wrote and illustrated some 20 children&#x27;s books, as well as &quot;Bunker Hill, Los Angeles&quot; (1964), intended for adults. His works often celebrated cultural diversity,&lt;ref name=&quot;curbed 2019/3/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and many were published in both English and Spanish.

==Childhood==

Politi was the younger of two children, born in Fresno, on November 21, 1908, to Italian-American parents Lodovico Politi and Mary Cazzola. Politi&#x27;s sister, Marie Therese, was two years older.

Politi was transported to Italy at the age of seven — in an &quot;Indian Chief suit,&quot; via transcontinental railroad and ocean liner — and grew up, constantly drawing, in his mother&#x27;s native village of Broni near Milan.

Lodovico left the family to take a job as a cobbler in Piacenza. Marie went to live with a poor aunt who operated a roadside inn. Politi was placed in a boarding home with an elderly woman and her daughter. Politi loved Broni, a deep affection that remained for the rest of his life. In Broni, he began to develop his artistic sense, drawing sketches of village life.

By 1920, the Politis reunited and moved to London where Politi was exposed to the culture and cosmopolitan lifestyle that Broni could never offer. On weekends, Leo and Marie packed a lunch basket and along with hundreds of other poor children lined up at a London theater to watch live shows and Charlie Chaplin films. Politi devoured everything that London had to offer a boy. He wandered through the city&#x27;s museums to view the works of Vincent van Gogh and other masters.

After one year, the Politi family returned to Broni where Leo began studying art on a six-year scholarship at the Superior Institute of Fine Arts—also known as the National Art Institute—at the Royal Palace at Monza near Milan.

==Early career==

In 1931, Politi, at the age of 22, left Italy for California. Passing through the Panama Canal he discovered the exotic beauty of Central America. He sketched the things that he saw and small stories began to bubble up within him.

He was attracted to the Mayan culture of the region and developed a palette that served as his core of colors throughout the 1930s and &#x27;40s. Politi later wrote of his technique: &quot;(I) developed an ochre yellow, burnt sienna and a number of brown tints symbolic of the warmth and earthy qualities of the life and vegetation of the tropical Central American jungle. I also used a lively blue-green symbolic of the water, sky and in small spots for precious stones used then in their ornaments as jade – all elements inherent to the Maya civilization.&quot;

Artist Buckley Mac-Gurrin, an art critic for the literary film magazine &quot;Script&quot; published by writer and artist Rob Wagner, wrote in a cover story of Politi in 1940 that &quot;Leo became proficient in the use of many media – oil, watercolor, wood-carving, wood engraving, lithography, book illustration; he had a very fine artistic education. His training was modern as opposed to academic; it tended to develop originality rather than subservient to the art forms of bygone eras. His own artistic philosophy drew him toward the genuine and the earthy; toward people whose contact with the soil was still fresh, intimate, satisfying.&quot;

Politi arrived in Los Angeles, California, in October 1931 and two years later he married Helen Fontes.

==Olvera Street==

Politi began sketching and painting from a regular spot on Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles, where he sketched tourists and sold drawings alongside potters, weavers and other artisans-in-residence. Politi&#x27;s affection for Mexican-Americans and their folkways was genuine; an affinity. Most especially, as a devout Catholic, at home with Italian saints, he responded to Mexican ritual. Children — natural, spontaneous children — he loved without reserve or distinction. Drawing Mexican children, for magazines and books, gave him an American career and a professional identity.
He painted a mural on Olvera Street &quot;The Blessing of the Animals&quot;, where he depicted a tradition of Catholicism in remembrance of St. Francis of Assisi&#x27;s love for all creatures. In the mural, men, women and children are walking their animals to get blessed.

During the 1930s he worked in oils, watercolors and wood sculptures. His best work was probably gouache on paper with variations of the theme of mother and child. He also focused on Mexican pueblo scenes, religious ceremonies and customs, dancers and mischievous children. His palette was generally the same: ochre yellow, burnt sienna and brown tints that to him defined the Mayan civilization.

His exhibits included the watercolor &quot;Peons Asleep&quot; and his sculpture &quot;Mother and Child&quot; at the Awards for the Ninth annual Exhibition of Southern California Art in 1937 in San Diego, California. In oil, Politi exhibited &quot;Two Women and a Child.&quot;

During the same year at the 18th annual Exhibition of Paintings and Sculptures at the Los Angeles Museum in Exposition Park, Politi&#x27;s wood sculpture &quot;Pedro and Pepa&quot; and watercolor &quot;Market Scene&quot; were exhibited. A year later &quot;Pedro and Pepa&quot; was displayed again at the 10th annual Southern California Art Exhibition at the Fine Arts Gallery in San Diego.

A one-man show at Alma Reed’s Delphic Studios in New York City in 1937 ultimately helped lead him into a career as a children&#x27;s author and illustrator on Latin themes.

His first book was &quot;Little Pancho&quot;, the illustrated story of a defiant, if not naughty, little Mexican boy on an adventure. Published in 1938, &quot;Little Pancho&quot; forever steered him onto the path as a children’s author. It also attracted the attention of the left-leaning &quot;Script&quot; magazine, for which Politi became the magazine’s art editor, and a smaller pacifist publication, &quot;Freedom&quot;, published by Prynce Hopkins.

==Early books==

He also illustrated &quot;The Least One&quot; by Ruth Sawyer in 1941, &quot;Aqui se Habla Espanol&quot; by Margarita Lopez and Esther Brown in 1942 and &quot;Angelo, the Naughty One&quot; by Helen Garrett in 1944. In 1944, he illustrated &quot;Stories from the Americas&quot;. It marked a distinct departure from Politi&#x27;s early impressionist, cubist and art deco styles to a softer and less dark, gritty execution that typified his later work. The softer tones and themes continued in all of his future books. Multiculturalism continued to be an overriding theme, but was not overtly political as seen in his magazine work.

==Recognition==
The Catholic Library Association each year presents the Regina Medal of excellence to one living exemplar of the words of the English poet, Walter de la Mare &quot;only the rarest kind of best in anything can be good enough for the young,&quot; for continued, distinguished contribution to children&#x27;s literature without regard to the nature of the contribution. In 1966 Leo Politi was the recipient of this distinguished award.
In 1974, a branch of the Fresno Public Library was named for him, and in 1991, the Leo Politi Elementary School was dedicated to him in Koreatown, a neighborhood in the Mid-Wilshire district of the City of Los Angeles. There is also a Leo Politi Square in Echo Park, where he lived for many years.

<doc id="1132205" wikidata="Q2026312" url="?curid=1132205" title="London Underground 1938 Stock">
<text>The London Underground 1938 Stock was a London Underground tube stock design. A total of 1,121 cars were built by Metro-Cammell and Birmingham RC&amp;W. An additional 173 cars were added to the fleet by the end of 1953, comprising 91 new builds (the 1949 Tube Stock), 76 conversions from Pre-1938 Tube Stock or 1935 Tube Stock, and six unconverted cars of 1935 Tube Stock, and the stock was used on the London Underground until 1988. During their long lives they worked on the Bakerloo, Northern, Piccadilly, East London, Central, and Northern City lines. Ten sets were refurbished and ran on the Isle of Wight as Class 483, making them the oldest passenger rolling stock operating timetabled services on the National Rail network at the time of their withdrawal in January 2021. 

The trains represented a major technical advance, as all the electrical equipment was located under the floor for the first time. All previous tube stock had large equipment compartments behind the driving cabs in motor cars, which reduced the space available for passengers by about a third.

==Numbers==
There were four types of car, one of which was produced in two forms:
* Driving Motor (DM) – 42 seats, plus 2 tip-up
** &#x27;A&#x27; DM – north/west facing; solid centre buffer
** &#x27;D&#x27; DM – south/east facing; spring-loaded centre buffer
* Non-Driving Motor (NDM) – 40 seats, no driving or door controls
* Special Non-Driving Motor (SNDM) – door controls only
* Trailer (T) – 40 seats, no motors or controls
As built, the 1938 Stock was numbered as follows:

==Use on different lines==
The 1938 Stock was built as part of the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s New Works Programme 1935–1940. The trains were primarily intended for use on the Northern and Bakerloo lines, with an additional seven trains also being used on the Piccadilly line.

As part of the New Works Programme, the Northern and Central lines were to be extended over London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) tracks, and because of a joint working agreement between the LPTB and the LNER, it was necessary for a proportion of the Underground fleet to be owned by the LNER. Accordingly, 289 cars of 1938 Stock (DM numbers 10238–323 and 11238–323, NDM numbers 12117–57 and T numbers 012313–88) were designated as LNER owned, and fitted with plates marked &quot;Property of LNER&quot;. Although 129 of these were to cover extensions to the Central line, none of them actually worked Central line services: they were mixed with the Northern and Bakerloo line fleets.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Northern line was worked exclusively by 1938/1949 Stock trains. They were starting to show their age by the late 1960s; the first withdrawals from the Northern line took place in the early 1970s with the introduction of the 1972 Stock trains.

In the mid-1970s, the 1972 Stock (Mark II) cars began to be used on the Bakerloo line in addition to 1938 Stock. The 1972 Stock cars were intended for eventual use on the Jubilee line (which opened in 1979), thereafter the remaining section of the Bakerloo line continued to be served exclusively by 1938 Stock cars until the 1980s. The Bakerloo line trains received an &quot;Extra Heavy Overhaul&quot; (EHO) to keep them in service long after their intended withdrawal date. The Bakerloo line was thus the last line to be operated solely by 1938 Stock trains.

The Piccadilly line&#x27;s few 1938 Stock trains operated alongside 1959 Stock for much of their lives. They were replaced by London Underground 1973 Stock, with the 1959 Stock being transferred to the Northern line, replacing other 1938 Stock trains.

During the 1970s, the short East London Line was worked by 1938 Stock trains, replacing trains of Q Stock. Single 1938 Stock trailer carriages were also inserted into 1960 Stock trains in the mid-1980s; these were used on the Woodford–Hainault and Epping–Ongar sections of the Central line. In addition, unit 10177 (latterly shipped to Alderney) worked the Epping–Ongar shuttle between November 1957 and June 1960.

With the 1959 Stock approaching life-expiry, five ex-Bakerloo line trains of 1938 Stock were given a further overhaul in the mid-1980s. These were then used on the Northern line for a further two years; the last day of passenger service was on 19 May 1988. They were then sold for further use on the Isle of Wight (see below).

==Nine-car trains==
As part of the New Works Programme of 1935–1940, there were plans to operate nine-car trains of 1938 stock on the Northern line. These cars were originally numbered differently from the other cars, the first digit &#x27;1&#x27; being replaced by a &#x27;9&#x27;.

The formation for a nine-car train would have been DM + NDM + SNDM + T + NDM + T + SNDM + NDM + DM.

With the scaling back of the planned extensions for the Northern and Bakerloo lines, and the need to order further stock to balance the fleet (the 1949 stock), cars were renumbered in the early 1950s.
The DMs, trailers, as well as twenty-eight of the thirty NDMs had the &#x27;9&#x27; replaced by a &#x27;1&#x27;, the DMs becoming 10324-10333 and 11324-11333, the trailers 012389-012408, and the NDMs 12029-12054 and 12056-12057.
NDMs 92055 and 92058 were rebuilt into Uncoupling Non-Driving Motors (UNDMs) along with all twenty SNDMs. The twenty two cars rebuilt into UNDMs were renumbered 30000-30021.

==1935/1949 Stock==
So successful was the 1938 Stock that, when, in 1948, additional cars were needed, 91 almost identical cars were built, 70 non-driving-motor (NDM) cars and 21 trailer cars. These were known as 1949 stock and operated with the 1938 stock. They were numbered in the same scheme; the UNDMs were numbered 30022-30045, 31000-31045 and the trailers 012495-012515.

After World War II, the former 1935 stock streamlined DMs were rebuilt into trailers, and included with the 1938 stock, being renumbered 012477-012494.
Before the war, three trailers were built for use with the streamlined DMs. These three cars differed from the 1938 trailers in that they were not equipped with compressors. However, the cars were not delivered until after the war and with the DMs rebuilt the three cars became part of the 1938 stock fleet, being numbered 012412-012414, and fitted with compressors.

==Technical==

===Electrical system===

Each motor car is fitted with two series DC motors, one on each of the two bogies and are designed to operate from the 630 volt traction supply. Each motor has an output of approximately 250 horsepower. The controllers and switchgear are operated from a 50 volt auxiliary supply provided by a motor-generator set. This system allows the master controller at one end of the train to simultaneously operate the switchgear on all the motor cars in a similar manner to the system developed by Sprague for the Elevated railway in Chicago, Illinois some 46 years earlier. This same supply is also used to power the train lighting as well as some other auxiliary circuits.

===&#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;D&#x27; motor cars===

The motor cars are divided into two distinct types, the &#x27;A&#x27; end car and the &#x27;D&#x27; end car. Each of the bogies fitted to the two cars is identical. This means that if the two motor cars at the two ends of a train were identical, they would attempt to pull the train in opposite directions. Consequently, the bogies on the &#x27;D&#x27; end motor car are installed the other way around from those on the &#x27;A&#x27; end causing the two motor cars to move the train in the same direction.

The &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;D&#x27; designation is from the designation of the axles on the two bogies. The &#x27;A&#x27; end car has the &#x27;A&#x27; axle at the driving cab end of the car with the &#x27;B&#x27; axle on the opposite end of the same bogie. The &#x27;C&#x27; axle on the second bogie is nearest the driving cab with the &#x27;D&#x27; axle closest to the coupled trailer car. The sequence is reversed on the &#x27;D&#x27; end motor car. This is also why the alternate car is not designated the logically more obvious &#x27;B&#x27; end.

Another mechanical difference between the two types of car is that the &#x27;D&#x27; end car has a spring-loaded buffer at the driving cab end whereas the &#x27;A&#x27; end car has a solid buffer.

These differences mean that when coupling two train sets together, the &#x27;A&#x27; end of one set must be coupled to the &#x27;D&#x27; end of the other. Although train sets are not normally split in day to day usage, they do have to be split when undergoing major maintenance tasks, such as when the bodies are lifted off of the bogies. This is not a problem on most lines, where all the train sets start and remain the same way around. However, on the Northern line the existence of the Kennington loop, just south of Kennington station, which allows Charing Cross branch trains to depart from its southbound platform and arrive at its northbound platform reverses the complete train once every journey. This means that, on this line, on average, half the trains will be facing in the opposite direction to the remainder. Only sets facing the same way can be coupled together.

===Traction control===

The 1938 design stock features the (by this time) standard series/parallel traction control using bridge transition. The control system has an unusual feature. Ordinarily, the driver moves the master controller from &#x27;off&#x27; up to &#x27;full series&#x27; and then further to the &#x27;full parallel&#x27; position when the train will be under full power.

The unusual feature is that once the driver has moved the controller to &#x27;full parallel&#x27; and the train has accelerated to the point where the switchgear is actually in full parallel, the driver can then move the master controller back to &#x27;full series&#x27;. The traction switchgear will remain in &#x27;full parallel&#x27; unless the driver moves the master controller from &#x27;full series&#x27; to any position towards &#x27;off&#x27;. Many drivers took advantage of this feature because it was more comfortable maintaining the downward pressure on the deadman&#x27;s handle with the handle at the 6 o&#x27;clock position (the &#x27;full series&#x27; position) rather than the 9 o&#x27;clock position (the &#x27;full parallel&#x27; position).

==58 trailers==
Some of the 1938 Stock trains were to provide the additional trains needed for line extensions, primarily on the Northern and Central lines; some were to replace older trains that were life-expired. It was desirable to concentrate the bulk of the 1938 Stock on two lines, the Bakerloo and Northern, and so a redistribution of the &#x27;Standard Stock&#x27; occurred, most of it moving to the Central and Piccadilly lines. This redistribution involved reforming some &#x27;Standard Stock&#x27; trains to have a different number of cars, as a result of which fifty-eight &#x27;Standard Stock&#x27; trailers, originally built in 1927, became surplus to that fleet. In 1938, these were converted to operate with the 1938 Stock, allowing the number of new cars to be correspondingly reduced. Since they differed significantly from the 1938 Stock and also from the rest of the &#x27;Standard Stock&#x27;, it was necessary to give them a different designation – and so they became known as the &#x27;58&#x27; trailers, 58 simply being the number of converted cars. These cars were renumbered 70513–70570. The first car withdrawn was 70550, as a result of damage sustained in an accident at Watford Junction in 1962, and the last car, 70534, was withdrawn in 1973.

==Isle of Wight==

In 1988, ten sets of 1938 stock were bought by Network SouthEast for use on the Island Line service on the Isle of Wight, and were allocated two-car TOPS Class 483. These units were heavily rebuilt and introduced between 1989 and 1992 to replace the even older Class 485 and 486 trains that had been running on the line since 1967, also constructed from ex-Tube stock. Four sets have been scrapped and the other six have been withdrawn, with the final service running on the 3 January 2021. As of January 2021, on withdrawal, the Class 483s were the oldest stock in mainline usage in the United Kingdom, aged 82 years.

The units were leased from HSBC Rail until South West Trains bought them outright in May 2007.

After running many years in Network SouthEast (NSE) colours, the trains were repainted into a Dinosaur themed livery to celebrate the Isle of Wight&#x27;s rich palaeontological history. However, due to customer dissatisfaction, all trains returned to an approximation of their original LT train red livery; albeit with yellow fronts, as per mainline regulations in 2008. In early-2018, the units had the Island Line sign and the South Western Railway logo.

In 2019, South Western Railway announced that as part of a £26m programme of improvements to the Island Line, the Class 483s were finally due to be replaced, following a spate of severe service interruptions from technical faults arising in the 81-year-old stock. The Vivarail D-Train, converted from London Underground D78 Stock, was selected as the successor to the Class 483s; five two-car EMU units are to be used on the network and classified as British Rail Class 484. The last converted 1938 stock ran in early 2021. Of the six units extant on the Isle of Wight at the time of retirement, four have been secured for preservation. 483006 and 483008 were obtained by the London Transport Traction Group for preservation and are currently at the Llanelli &amp; Mynwydd Mawr Railway in Carmarthenshire. South Wales two of the four preserved units are remaining on the Isle of Wight; 483007 was transferred to the adjacent Isle of Wight Steam Railway, initially as a static exhibit but with a medium-term goal of running the train, either via propulsion from one of the railway&#x27;s diesel shunters or through the installation of a battery power supply system, while 483004, which had previously been used as a source of spare parts after withdrawal, was purchased by and delivered to Holliers Farm in Hale Common, near the village of Arreton.

==Accidents==

A crash involving 1938 stock occurred at Moorgate on 28 February 1975. A train hit the dead end wall of the station, killing 43 people including the driver in unclear circumstances. After the accident, a safety system named after the crash (Moorgate Protection) was introduced in 1978.

==Preservation==

In addition, some other units survive in preservation, including cars from the first-built unit, which are preserved at the London Transport Museum Depot in Acton. The preserved sets have been restored into their original red liveries, one with an orange roof (Bakerloo line) and one with a grey roof (other lines). The LTM operates trips of its preserved four-car set for railtours around the LU system. The 1938 stock is also used for occasional filming work. Dates and times can be found at their website and people can sign up to receive the museum&#x27;s e-newsletter. A cab has been preserved at London Transport Museum. A complete train was purchased by the Epping Ongar Railway from the Isle of Wight Island Line in 2020, for restoration and eventual conversion to battery power. Another unit, 483–007, known as &quot;Jess Harper,&quot; was acquired by the Isle of Wight Steam Railway for static display. Alderney Railway formerly rostered some 1938 stock cars formerly used on the Bakerloo and Northern lines until they were withdrawn in 2000 due to severe rust issues. 

==Commemoration==
On 9 January 2013, 1938 tube stock appeared on a £1.28 British postage stamp as part of a set commemorating the 150th anniversary of the first London underground train journey. The stamp&#x27;s captions read &quot;Classic rolling stock&quot; and &quot;1938&quot;, with the caption&#x27;s background in Bakerloo line colour.

<doc id="1132212" wikidata="Q159161" url="?curid=1132212" title="Cemal Gürsel">
<text>Cemal Gürsel (; 9 June 1894 – 14 September 1966) was a Turkish military officer and politician who was the 4th president of Turkey, serving from 1960 to 1966 after taking power in a coup d&#x27;état.

== Early life ==
Gürsel was born in the town of Hınıs in the Erzurum Vilayet as the son of an Ottoman Army officer, Abidin Bey, and the grandson of Ibrahim (1821–1895) and the great-grandson of Hadji Ahmed (1788–1860). After the elementary school in Ordu and the military middle school in Erzincan, he graduated from the Kuleli military high school in Istanbul. He was a popular figure and was therefore nicknamed &quot;Cemal Ağa&quot; (Cemal the Big Fellow) since his childhood school years and onwards all his life. Gürsel served in the Army for 45 years. During World War I, he participated in the Battle of Çanakkale in Dardanelles, Gallipoli as a lieutenant with the First Battery of the 12th Artillery Regiment in 1915 and received the War Medal. He later fought at the Palestine and Syria fronts in 1917 and became a prisoner of war by the British while suffering malaria during his command of the 5th Battery of the 41st Regiment on 19 September 1918. Gürsel was kept as a prisoner of war in Egypt until 6 October 1920. During his presidency much later, when interviewed by the foreign press as to why he had not learned English during his captivity, he somewhat regretfully recalled that he was so frustrated to be a captive, he protested and studied French in the British camp instead.

After his release, Cemal Gürsel returned to Anatolia to re-join Mustafa Kemal subsequent to Erzurum Congress and took part in all the western front campaigns in the Turkish War of Independence between 1920 and 1923. He was promoted for gallantry in the First Division excelling in the battles of Second Inönü, Eskişehir and Sakarya, and was later awarded the Medal of Independence by the first Parliament for his combat service in the Final Offensive.

Gürsel was married, in 1927, to Melahat, the daughter of the chief engineer on the Ottoman cruiser &quot;Hamidiye&quot;. From this marriage, a son Özdemir was born. The couple adopted two daughters named Hatice and Türkan.

== Military career ==
Cemal Gürsel attended the Turkish Military College and graduated in 1929 as a staff officer. He was promoted colonel in 1940. He was made a brigadier general in 1946 and made commander of the 65th Division. He was later the commander of the 12th Division, the 18th Corps commander, and commander of the 2nd Interior Tasks District. Made Lieutenant general in 1953, was general in 1957, being appointed Commander of 3rd Army. Service included chief of intelligence, and he was appointed as the Commander of Land Forces in 1958 when he was commanding an army.

Gürsel, as an easy-going and fatherly figure with a fine sense of humor, was well liked both nationally and in NATO circles, and had earned the respect and confidence of both the nation and the armed forces with his professional knowledge and demeanor. A patriotic memorandum he sent on 3 May 1960 to the Minister of Defense in an effort to establish checks and balances on ongoing affairs, reflecting his personal views in continuation of the chat they had the night before, expressing his support to the prime minister Adnan Menderes and belief that the Prime Minister should replace the President with immediate effect to bolster a much needed national unity, resulted in his suspension from his post, forcing early retirement instead of becoming the next Chief of the Turkish General Staff.

A farewell letter by him, advocating and urging the army to stay out of politics, was forwarded to all units of the armed forces at the time of his departure on leave. Cemal Gürsel&#x27;s statement read: &#x27;Always hold high the honor of the army and the uniform you wear. Protect yourselves from the current ambitious and harmful political atmosphere in the country. Stay away from the politics at all cost. This is of utmost importance to your honor, the army&#x27;s might and the future of the country.&#x27; He went to İzmir where he became the president of the Anti-Communism Association of Turkey.

== Head of state ==

A &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; organised and conducted by army officers at the rank of colonels and below took place without the participation or leadership of Cemal Gürsel on 27 May 1960 after continuing civilian and academia unrests throughout the country. It is rumored that four-star general Ragıp Gümüşpala, the Commander of the Third Army based in Eastern Anatolia, gave an ultimatum to the rebelling officers that if they did not have a general appointed as their head, the Third Army would attack to take over the capital and the administration of the country, thereby forcing the rebel group to find a senior officer over them. Because of his immense popularity among the public and military ranks, Gürsel was subsequently chosen by the revolutionaries overnight and brought into the chairmanship of the military coup and became, , the only leader in the world put into power by a military takeover who had previously had no role in its planning or execution. He, while still in his pajamas, was escorted to Ankara in the military C-47 transport plane by a captain who was the youngest officer of the radical coup team who that by that time had already sent President Celal Bayar, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Chief of General Staff Rüştü Erdelhun and some other members of the ruling Democratic Party to a military court on Yassıada in the Sea of Marmara, accusing them of violation of the constitution. The day after the coup, four-star general Cemal Gürsel was declared the commander in chief, Head of state, Prime minister and Minister of Defense of the 24th government on 30 May 1960, in theory giving him more absolute powers than even Kemal Atatürk had ever had.

Gürsel freed 200 students and nine newsmen, and licensed 14 banned newspapers to start publishing again (&quot;Time&quot;, 6 June 1960). He fetched ten law professors, namely Sıddık Sami Onar, Hıfzı Veldet Velidedeoğlu, Ragıp Sarıca, Naci Şensoy, Hüseyin Nail Kubalı, Tarık Zafer Tunaya, İsmet Giritli, İlhan Arsel, Bahri Savcı and Muammer Aksoy, accompanied by Erdoğan Teziç, a law postgraduate student as their assistant (later Chairman of the Turkish Council of Higher Education), from Istanbul and Ankara Universities to help draft a new constitution on 27 May, right after he arrived in Ankara. During their first meeting with General Cemal Gürsel on the same day, Prof. Onar declared on behalf of the group of law academicians that &#x27;the circumstances of the day should not be interpreted as an ordinary and political &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, implying the revolution being brought by the change process starting in the republic that day. President Cemal Gürsel also formed a scientific council to guide the Ministry of Defence, later forming the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey to advise the government more broadly.

He appointed General Ragıp Gümüşpala, the commander of the Third Army, as the new Chief of the General Staff who, upon his retirement in two months, was succeeded by General Cevdet Sunay, and Gümüşpala was further directed by Gürsel to form the new Justice Party to bring together the former members of the Democratic Party. A simple and conservative sort, Gürsel became Turkey&#x27;s most popular figure, forbade display of his picture alongside Atatürk&#x27;s in government offices, rode about in an open Jeep touring rural communities, talking to the peasants almost as if they were his children (&quot;Time&quot;, 6 January 1961). He was successful with his personal interventions in reducing the number of execution verdicts from the Yassıada trials from 15 down to three. Gürsel&#x27;s plea for forgiveness and attempts along with several other world leaders for the reversal of the execution sentences and for the release of Adnan Menderes and two other ministers were rejected by the Junta. A member of the National Unity Committee writes in his memoirs that, upon Cemal Gürsel&#x27;s intervention on the prevention of Menderes&#x27; execution, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Altay Ömer Egesel, said: ‘Let us hurry! They will save him (Menderes)!’, also arranging a contingency plan for conducting the execution in a Navy Destroyer in the event of a forgiveness operation in Imrali Island to save Menderes while, at the same time, placing a press release questioning the legal ability of Gürsel for an intervention. Senator Mehmet Feyyat, District Attorney of Istanbul at the time, recently declared: ‘They cut off our phone lines. Adnan Menderes was hanged against the regulations. I was supposed to oversee the execution. The revolution tribunal&#x27;s chief prosecutor Egesel conducted the execution despite not being authorized. İsmet İnönü and Cemal Gürsel were already phoning for him (Menderes) not to be executed but the telecommunications office cut off the lines and Egesel made use of the (communication) gap to conduct the execution. Cemal Gürsel resisted pressure to continue military rule, Through direct efforts of then PM İsmet İnönü during his presidency military has thwarted two military coup attempts made by Talat Aydemir, appointed the organizers of the coup who were keen on staying in power by force of arms such as Alparslan Türkeş to overseas posts and played an important role in the preparation of a new constitution and return to the democratic order of the Kemalist vision.

== Statesman ==

Cemal Gürsel rescheduled and attended the previously cancelled Turkish and Scottish national football teams&#x27; game in Ankara on 8 June 1960 (Turkey 4, Scotland 2) which was followed by a National Football Tournament, the Cemal Gürsel Cup, that helped boost the national morale in the post-coup weeks with finals in Istanbul on 3 July (Fenerbahçe 1, Galatasaray 0). He took an active role in extensive modernization of Turkish Armed Forces and the staunch defense of the free world and Europe during the Cold War, in particular during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The declaration of independence of Cyprus according to the prior agreements and the deployment of a Turkish military unit to Cyprus took place in August 1960. He hosted the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ankara in early 1961 and the visit of the vice president Lyndon Johnson in 1962. Gürsel obtained, with the coordinated work of Sir Bernard Burrows, and granted permission of the ruling military National Unity Committee (NUC) for British military combat aircraft to overfly Turkish airspace on their way to support Kuwait, which was under threat of invasion by Iraq in July 1961.

When questioned by a German journalist regarding his intentions on becoming the next president upon proposal of the interim parliament, Cemal Gürsel responded that he was ready to serve only if asked by the nation, not by the interim house. He neither put his own candidacy forward for the presidency nor lobbied for his election or against any other candidate in any way. He offered his endorsement of candidacy of several high rank academicians in Medicine and Sciences in Ankara for both the interim prime minister and future president positions. Gürsel placed a special emphasis on participatory democracy with the promotion of the full interests of the nation&#x27;s minorities, appointing Turkish Citizen ethnic leaders Hermine Kalustyan of Armenian, Kaludi Laskari of Greek and Erol Dilek of Jewish origin as his &quot;Deputy Representatives of Head of State&quot; and the full members of the interim House of Representatives. The editor of &quot;Shalom&quot;, Avram Leyon, accompanied him on his travels and foreign state functions. He re-established the freedom of speech that was overwhelmingly taken away from the media organs and from the press by the previous cabinet.

The constitution, which brought for the first time a full text of civil and political rights under constitutional protection along with an improved system of checks and balances in Turkish history, was approved by a referendum held on 10 October 1961. With the establishment of the first Constitutional Court that created a new paradigm shift by scrutinizing the parliamentary rulings as the &quot;checks&quot; organ in 1961 and the addition of a Senate to the parliament, the Turkish Grand National Assembly was re-opened after the general elections, nominated and voted him as the fourth president of Turkey. Journalist Parliamentarian Cihat Baban claims in his book, &quot;The Gallery of Politics&quot; (Politika Galerisi) that Cemal Gürsel told him &quot;We may solve all troubles if Süleyman Demirel becomes the head of the Justice Party (Adalet Partisi). I am working very hard for him become the party leader. If I succeed in this, I will be happy..&quot; Demirel was elected chairman at the second grand party convention on 28 November 1964. The President of the Republic of Turkey Cemal Gürsel assigned the mandate to form and serve as the Prime Minister of the new government to İsmet İnönü in November 1961, June 1962 and December 1963, to Senator Suat Hayri Ürgüplü in February 1965 and, following the general elections, to Suleyman Demirel of Justice Party in October 1965.

With the reduction of tensions between the West and the Soviet bloc, Gürsel sought improved relations for his country&#x27;s population of 27.8 million with the Soviet Union, such as the initiation of a telephone line agreement, as with the other members of the Western alliance while initiating new credit agreements with the US and the UK as well as bilateral technical and investment relations with Germany in 1960s.

The atomic reactor in Istanbul became operational in 1962 along with his establishment of the first Research and State Library of the government in two years after his administration started. He promoted the grant of the freedom of and the legal rights to form unions and to go on strike in the country. Turkish Universities gained autonomous independence by law for the first time upon the legislation he passed. Cemal Gürsel granted a presidential pardon for the life sentences of the previous president Celal Bayar and the former chief of general staff Rüştü Erdelhun whose prior execution sentence was also revoked by the National Unity Committee upon Gürsel&#x27;s appeals. He initiated the new era of planned economy in Turkey, formed a State Institute of Statistics, launched the State Planning Organization (DPT) that implemented &quot;The First 5-Years Development Plan&quot;, arranged re-entry of the Turkish Republic in the United Nations Security Council in 1961 and moved Turkey, through his close and personal diplomatic dialogues with Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, into the direction of European Union membership with the Ankara Agreement, signed with France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg in 1963, resulting in associate membership the following year and a large Turkish workforce migration to Germany and Western Europe to assist their postwar industrial development.

When a Cypriot leader who was exiled out of the UK previously in 1956 on the basis of his struggle for Cypriot independence from the British rule, wanted in November 1963 to amend the basic articles of the 1960 constitution, communal violence ensued and Turkey, Great Britain and Greece, the guarantors of the agreements which had led to Cyprus&#x27; independence, wanted to send a NATO force to the island under the command of General Young. Due to the continued ethnic violence between the Cypriot Turks and Cypriot Greeks, President Gürsel ordered warning flights and subsequent continuous air assaults by the Turkish Air Force against the island which continued between 7 and 10 August 1964, ending with the fulfillment of the military objectives of Turkey, and the invitation to calm by Nikita Khrushchev of USSR.

Cemal Gürsel reformed the &quot;Teskilat-i Mahsusa&quot;, the &quot;Special Organization&quot; of clandestine security services to the National Intelligence Organization in response to and preparation against escalating international terrorism trends in 1963. He paved the way to Middle Eastern countries and Pakistan to concentrate on economic and cultural matters of mutual interest and Ankara recognized Syria following the breakup of the short-lived United Arab Republic in 1961, further reestablishing diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1965. In July 1964, Pakistani President Ayub Khan, Turkish President Cemal Gürsel, and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran announced in Istanbul the establishment of the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) organization to promote transportation and joint economic projects also envisioning Afghanistan and possibly Indonesia joining at some time in the future. He granted asylum to the political dissidents Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran and Molla Barzani of Iraq.

Gürsel, 40 years after the foundation of the Republic, launched the first radio broadcasting station of Eastern Anatolia within the centrally located province of Erzurum, where Ankara and Istanbul radios’ transmissions were not received. He brought the Microwave Telecommunications Network into operation increasing telephone and teletype capacity along with a High-Frequency Radio Link connecting London and Ankara with Rawalpindi, Karachi, Tehran and Istanbul. He laid the foundations of the new agricultural and structural development plans for the south-eastern Anatolian regions in early 1960s for the first time. With his directive, The Sacred Relics from the Prophets Abraham, Moses, Joseph, David and Muhammad, including the oldest Qur&#x27;an in existence from the 7th Century were put on display from their storage rooms within the Topkapi Palace for public viewing for the first time on 31 August 1962. Gürsel added the first Ministry of Culture and Tourism to the cabinet. In a parallel effort of promoting the country&#x27;s touristic popularity in the West, &quot;Topkapi&quot;, the movie version of the book by Eric Ambler that had been commissioned for the same purpose, was shot in Paris and Istanbul and was introduced with success. Similarly, one of the favorite books of John F. Kennedy, Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; was shot in Istanbul as the second James Bond movie, to promote the touristic popularity of Turkey, with his keen interest. The Directorate of Religious Affairs network of the country was founded with his directive and became operational on 22 June 1965. He started the new procedure of returning the law proposals presented for the President&#x27;s approval back to the Parliamentary re-discussions in 1963. Cemal Gürsel founded The National Security Council (MGK) as well as the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) in 1963, appointing Professor Cahit Arf as its first director, officially charging TUBITAK primarily with governmental advisory duty by legislation. In addition to the foundation of the Turkish Radio and Television (TRT) organization as a government agency in 1964 that brought television broadcasting to Turkey for the first time under his administration, the opening of The School of Press and Broadcasting at the college of Political Sciences in Ankara followed in November 1965. The country&#x27;s new initiative of Planning of Population Growth Control was put in effect in 1965. The production of the first domestic Turkish automobile, the Devrim (Revolution), took place with Cemal Gürsel&#x27;s directive which sparked the initiation of an automotive industry in the republic in the following few years. The first use of a computer in the country, iron and steel mass production growth, the thermic power plant and a petrol pipeline structuring took place during his presidency. Cemal Gürsel refused remuneration for his Head of State and subsequent Presidential positions and made his and his family&#x27;s living with his retired general&#x27;s salary, meeting their own expenses during their life in the Presidential Palace in Çankaya, Ankara.

== Illness ==
Because of a paralysis that started in early 1961 and progressed quickly in 1966, on 2 February Cemal Gürsel was flown to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., on the private airplane &quot;BlueBird&quot; sent by US President Lyndon B. Johnson. One week later, he fell into a coma there after suffering a series of new paralytic strokes. The government decided he return to Turkey on 24 March. President Johnson travelled by helicopter from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., to pay his respects to President Cemal Gürsel on his departure to home, In addition to issuing the following statement &#x27;Our distinguished friend, President Cemal Gursel of Turkey, came to the United States on 2 February for medical treatment. There was hope that new therapeutic procedures only recently developed in this country would be useful in treating his illness of several years. We were initially encouraged by his progress at Walter Reed Hospital, only to be shocked by the news on 8 February that his health had suffered a grave new blow. Our best talent, coupled with the skill of the eminent Turkish doctors who accompanied the President, was exerted to the utmost in the hope that the President might return to his home in fully restored health. We are saddened that this hope was not to be realized. We have been deeply honored to have President Gürsel come to our country to seek medical treatment. As he returns to his homeland, our prayers go with him&#x27;. With a report of a medical committee by Gülhane Military Hospital in Ankara, the parliament ruled on 28 March 1966 that his presidency be terminated due to ill health in accordance with the constitution. He died of apoplexy at 6:45 pm on 14 September 1966 in Ankara. He left behind no directives or last will. He was laid to rest at the &quot;Freedom Martyrs Memorial&quot; section in the yard of the mausoleum of Atatürk. His body was transferred on 27 August 1988 to a permanent burial place in the newly built Turkish State Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
He tried to place emphasis on the need for a well-educated youth and a hard-working population with high standards of ethics in Atatürk&#x27;s tradition (commentary by Imran Oktem, Chief Supreme Court Justice – Yargitay, 1966). Erzurum Cemal Gürsel Stadium and some schools and streets were named after him. The developments during his term were described as the &quot;Turkish Revolution&quot; which was celebrated annually on 27 May as the Constitution Day until 1981. In 2002, a commemorative coin was released for the same. In 2008, the movie &quot;Cars of the Revolution&quot; was released in his memory.

== Quotes from him ==
* &quot;&quot;I took over the administration of the state to stop the tragic course of events.&quot; (Cemal Gürsel, radio address on the evening of 27 May 1960)
* &quot;The network was ready. I personally did not want the army to intervene and had been stopping the attempts (of takeover) of my younger friends. Things reached to such a state that despite my belief that the army should not interfere I let them free in their duties. Now my only goal is to reinstate an administration built on the principles of justice and ethics.&quot; (Cemal Gürsel, An interview. &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot;, 16 July 1960)
* &quot;Those who follow Atatürk will not be left behind.&quot; (Cemal Gürsel, from the address on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Atatürk&#x27;s death, 10 November 1963)

== Quotes about him ==

* &quot;General Gursel may be described as the father of the second Turkish Republic similar to Atatürk being the father of modern Turkey. At a time of deep division, Gursel earned and maintained the respect of the Turkish Nation that regarded him as the symbol of national unity. When he passed away, he had the identity of the trusted father of the nation.&quot;&quot; (Prof. Bernard Lewis, 15 September 1966)
* &quot;&quot;A few days before the coup, it was known that the coup was imminent but General Cemal Gursel was dismissed as a non-political general. No leading role by General Cemal Gursel was determined despite the foreknowledge of the plot.&quot; (&quot;The CIA; The Inside Story&quot; by Andrew Tully, pages 51, 53. Crest books, 1962)
* &quot;On 27 May, he (Cemal Gursel) was hurriedly requested to come (from his residence in İzmir) to the capital (Ankara) to assume the leadership of National Unity Committee.&quot; (&quot;The Turkish Revolution, Aspects of Military politics&quot;. By Walter Weiker. pages 121, 122. The Brookings Institution, 1963)
* &quot;When 27 May revolt occurred, Cemal Gürsel was not a participant. He was invited to become the head due to the circumstances and he willingly accepted.&quot; (Burhan Felek, &quot;Milliyet&quot;, Page 2, 18 September 1971)
* &quot;General Gürsel was brought into the NUC chairmanship by the revolution team when he was in retirement preparation. In actuality he was in the position of a chairman found in last minute with a hurried search. He never was the responsible leader for a true leader is not to be appointed but is self-appointed.&quot; (By a leading member of the NUC)
* &quot;One of the core players of the coup, Orhan Erkanli told that they revolted on 27 May without knowing what to do on 28 May. No one, including Cemal Gürsel knew who and how many would be forming the NUC. In actuality, even Cemal Gürsel was brought in later.&quot; (&quot;Years of Ismet Pasha of our Democracy&quot;, 1960–61 by Metin Toker, page 25. Bilgi. 1998)
* &quot;It is now known that the coup was the result of years of planning on the part of conspirators, a number of radical colonels and ranks below in their early forties. He (Cemal Gürsel) was not involved in the details of the organization of the coup d&#x27;état. When the coup had succeeded, he was brought to Ankara.&quot; (&quot;Turkey, A modern History&quot; by Erik Zurcher. pages 253,254. I.B. Tauris, 2003)
* &quot;We just see that a few very important lines in his letter (to the Minister of Defence) had been censored. That means we are going without learning the true history, without knowing who knows what facts and what true pictures of turning points.&quot; (Çetin Altan, Author, Journalist, September 2006)
* &quot;An extremely important document that sheds light on the past has been revealed. Testimony from eyewitnesses at the time helped make known that the letter had been modified after 27 May, but the location of the original letter was unknown. This important document adds a new dimension to the 27 May revolution. We have come face to face with a new document that changes our written history. It was my greatest wish to obtain just such a document; not for my own satisfaction, but for my father, to prove this reality and obtain genuine evidence. I was thrilled when I heard about this.&quot; (Mr Aydın Menderes, Author, the Son of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, September 2006)
* &quot;They cut off our phone lines. Adnan Menderes was hung against the regulations. I was supposed to oversee the execution. The revolution tribunal&#x27;s chief prosecutor Altay Egesel conducted the execution despite not being authorized. İsmet İnönü and Cemal Gürsel were already phoning for him (Adnan Menderes) not to be executed but the telecommunications&#x27; office cut off the lines and Egesel made use of the (communication) gap to conduct the execution.&quot; (&quot;Mehmet Feyyat, District Attorney General, Istanbul Province Prosecutor General 1961, The Administrator of the Imrali Prison, The Lawyer of the Year, Senator. &quot; (Reported by Özkan GÜVEN, STAR Newspaper, 13 November 2006 with a summary in Turkish at Law in the Capitol)
* &quot;Where are we now and where are the nations such as Portugal, Greece and Spain with whom we departed for the competition of development in 1960s? While we still crawl around $5000 per capita income, they have caught $20K pci a long while ago. In one word, an embarrassment.&quot; (Hasan Cemal, Milliyet, October 2006)
* &quot;We built an automobile with the mentality of the West and we forgot to put gasoline in it with the mentality of the East.&quot;&quot; (Cemal Gürsel, President, on the Anniversary of the Turkish Republic, 29 October 1963)

<text>The British Rail Class 483 electric multiple units were originally built as 1938 tube stock units for London Underground. They were extensively refurbished between 1989 and 1992 by Eastleigh Works, for use on services on the Isle of Wight&#x27;s Island Line. This was despite having already been used for nearly 50 years on the London Underground network. The units replaced the even older and life-expired British Rail Classes 485 and 486 units which were introduced in 1967, but were originally built as &#x27;Standard&#x27; stock units for the London Electric Railway in 1923.

The 483s were 83 years old when they were withdrawn in January 2021; they were the oldest passenger trains in Great Britain in regular passenger service at the time. That honour was passed to the London Underground 1972 Stock trains that are still in service on the Bakerloo line at years old. The 483s were withdrawn on 3 January 2021, with the line closed from 4 January until 1 November 2021 for upgrade works, after which they were replaced by five two-car Class 484s. Of the six units present on the Island at the time of their withdrawal, all have been confirmed for preservation.

==History==
===Prior to Isle of Wight service===
The trains were originally built by Metro-Cammell as 1938 tube stock for London Underground. An initial batch was withdrawn from service in 1973, and they were considered for use on the Island Line (which would not bear that name for another 16 years). However, the under-floor equipment was thought to be a problem, as extensive adaptations would be needed to Ryde Works to allow fitters to access it. It was also felt that the under-floor equipment would be vulnerable to salt water damage on Ryde Pier, especially in bad weather.

The last batch of 1938 stock was withdrawn in London in 1985, except for five trains required on the Northern line between 1986 and May 1988 due to increasing passenger numbers. In 1987, Network SouthEast (NSE) managers realised that the existing 1923-built trains on the Isle of Wight would not be economically serviceable beyond around 1990 and thoughts turned to the future of the line. After closure of the route was discounted, it was decided to purchase and refurbish 1938 stock.

In April 1988, London Underground offered a total of 28 carriages in revenue-earning condition to NSE, joined by three further carriages in May 1989. In addition, between May 1988 and October 1990, four scrap vehicles and nine works vehicles, to be used for spare parts, were taken from LU&#x27;s Ruislip depot. While the project&#x27;s feasibility study suggested that three-car units would be preferred, it was thought that the alterations required to Ryde depot would be both difficult and expensive. It was instead decided that two-car units would be used, using a maximum of six coaches in any train formation. Of the 31 coaches available, 20 were selected for use on the island. These were extensively refurbished between 1989 and 1992 by Eastleigh Works to ready them for service on the line.
As well as cosmetic and structural work, significant electrical works were required both to replace dilapidated wiring, and to allow the trains to work from the line&#x27;s third rail electrical supply.

Eight two-car units were initially refurbished between 1989 and 1990. These units were numbered 483001-008, although only the final three digits were carried on the cab ends. Units were painted in the new Network SouthEast livery, of blue with red and white stripes. The first unit was tested on the South West Main Line between Basingstoke and Eastleigh before travelling to Fratton ready for its transfer to the island. Testing and crew training on the remaining units took place on the Portsmouth Direct Line and Shepperton Branch Line.

===On the island===
The first unit, 001, arrived on the Isle of Wight on 5 July 1989 following an overnight ferry crossing from Portsmouth to Fishbourne. It was delivered by road to Sandown, then hauled to Ryde depot by one of the existing passenger trains. It began test running on the Island Line in the evening of 6 July, before a public launch on 13 July. Regular passenger services using the Class 483 did not commence until October, while the last of the eight planned units did not enter service until July 1990.

While it was originally planned to use only eight units, in 1992—two years after the rest of the fleet had entered service—the ninth unit, numbered 009, was also refurbished and transported to the island. A 10th unit was also shipped to Ryde depot, although this was for spares only and was never used in passenger operation on the Island. This unit was unofficially given the unit number 483010.

Each unit was formed of two driving motor vehicles, numbered 121–129 and 221–229. The technical description of this formation was DMSO(A)+DMSO(B).

When the units were first introduced, the final digit of the unit number and the final digit of the carriage numbers corresponded, such that unit 001 was formed of vehicles 121 and 221. However, since then, a few rearrangements have taken place to the unit formations.
In 1996, with the privatisation of British Rail, the Ryde–Shanklin line became the Island Line franchise, which was won by the Stagecoach Group. Services continued to be branded as Island Line trains. In 1999 three units (001, 003 and 005) were permanently withdrawn from service as surplus to requirements, leaving only six units remaining serviceable. In the early 2000s, the remaining units were overhauled and were repainted into a new livery of blue and yellow with pictures of dinosaurs. From 2007 to 2008, all units were repainted into their original London Transport red livery (albeit with yellow warning panels on the cab rather than the original red).

According to an article in the October 2005 issue of &quot;Rail Professional&quot; magazine, at that time Island Line was paying &quot;an eye-watering £140,000 a year&quot; to lease the trains, meaning that &quot;[s]ince privatisation, HSBC Rail has pocketed over £1m for leasing these relics that are effectively worthless.&quot; In March 2007, South West Trains purchased the rolling stock outright from the leasing company HSBC Rail for £1.

Further that year, the Island Line franchise was amalgamated with South West Trains as part of the new South Western franchise.

===Refurbishment===
The Class 483 trains were last refurbished during 2007;
work on the six unit fleet included:
* an exterior repaint into London Transport maroon with cream window pillars
* a retrim of the seat moquette into the same moquette that the London Underground A60/62 Stock received during their refurbishment between 1993 and 1998
When South Western Railway took over the franchise in 2017, it launched a consultation on the future of Island Line services, revealing that only three of the six remaining units were serviceable.

===Replacement===

On 13 September 2019, South Western Railway announced that because of a &quot;safety issue&quot; only one of the units was able to run, which meant cancelling just under half of scheduled services and running only an hourly service on the Island Line. This reduction in service was by mid-September expected to last for approximately one month, until 14 October, but the company warned that the trains&#x27; age and increasing difficulty of getting spare parts meant it might take longer. Normal service was not restored for approximately 5 weeks, but further fleet faults brought repeated disruption through much of November. Just 3 days after the news that only one Class 483 was serviceable, on 16 September 2019 the government announced that the fleet would be replaced by five two-car Class 484s.

===Preservation===
The London Transport Traction Group was founded to facilitate the preservation of a Class 483 unit to run via an on-board power supply on the Epping Ongar Railway in Essex. On 24 November 2020, the group confirmed that it had been successful in securing a unit, probably 006 or 008. It was later announced that both 006 and 008 were going to be preserved by the group.

After problems relating to a lack of space at the Epping Ongar Railway, the London Transport Traction Group announced that Units 006 and 008 will instead be preserved at the Llanelli and Mynydd Mawr Railway, making 006 and 008 the first tube trains to be housed at a preserved railway in Wales.

It is also known that the Isle of Wight Steam Railway will be taking on unit 483007 &quot;Jess Harper&quot; which had gone under a 3-year overhaul, the last to be overhauled at Ryde traincare depot. It is planned, in the short term, for the unit to be displayed in the &#x27;Train Story Discovery Centre&#x27;. It is hoped that in the years to come the unit will be able to run on its own power along the line.

On 29 July 2020, SWR, the owner and operator, announced that it was looking for new homes for the trains as soon as possible, to make room for the arrival of the first Class 484 units for testing later in the year. SWR had already received enquiries from preservation groups, including the adjacent Isle of Wight Steam Railway. Organisations expressing interest will need to demonstrate the capacity and financial security to remove and look after the train, as well as an appropriate long-term physical storage location.

==Fleet details==
Only two of nine units remained serviceable throughout most of 2020, the remainder having been taken out of service progressively since April 2000. On 29 July 2020 South Western Railway announced that the six extant units would be offered for preservation. Despite its impending withdrawal, unit 007 received a full overhaul, returning to service on 11 December 2020.

<doc id="1132221" wikidata="Q992653" url="?curid=1132221" title="Brunhes–Matuyama reversal">
<text>The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, named after Bernard Brunhes and Motonori Matuyama, was a geologic event, approximately 781,000 years ago, when the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field last underwent reversal. Estimations vary as to the abruptness of the reversal. A 2004 paper estimated that it took over several thousand years; a 2010 paper estimated that it occurred more quickly, perhaps within a human lifetime; a 2019 paper estimated that the reversal lasted 22,000 years.

The apparent duration at any particular location can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on geomagnetic latitude and local effects of non-dipole components of the Earth&#x27;s field during the transition.

The Brunhes–Matuyama reversal is a marker for the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) defining the base of the Chibanian Stage and Middle Pleistocene Subseries at the Chiba section, Japan, which was officially ratified in 2020 by the International Union of Geological Sciences. It is useful in dating ocean sediment cores and subaerially erupted volcanics. 

There is a highly speculative theory that connects this reversal event to the large Australasian strewnfield (c. 790,000 years ago), although the causes of the two are almost certainly unconnected and only coincidentally happened around the same time. Adding to the data is the large African Bosumtwi impact event (c. 1.07 million years ago) and the later Jaramillo reversal (c. 1 million years ago), another pair of events which has not gone unnoticed.

<doc id="1132223" wikidata="Q1481411" url="?curid=1132223" title="IT service management">
<text>Information technology service management (ITSM) are the activities performed by an organization to design, build, deliver, operate and control IT services offered to customers.

Differing from more technology-oriented IT management approaches like network management and IT systems management, IT service management is characterized by adopting a process approach towards management, focusing on customer needs and IT services for customers rather than IT systems, and stressing continual improvement. The CIO WaterCooler&#x27;s 2017 ITSM report states that business uses ITSM &quot;mostly in support of customer experience (35%) and service quality (48%).&quot; 

== Process ==

Execution of ITSM processes in an organization, especially those processes that are more workflow-driven, can benefit significantly from being supported with specialized software tools.

ITSM tools are often marketed as ITSM suites, which support a whole set of ITSM processes. At their core is usually a workflow management system for handling incidents, service requests, problems and changes. They usually also include a tool for a configuration management database (CMDB). The ability of these suites to enable easy linking between incident, service request, problem and change records with each other and with records of configuration items from the CMDB, can be a great advantage.
ITSM tools and processes are commonly referred to as ITIL tools, when in fact they are not the same. More than 100 tools are self-proclaimed ITSM tools - example &#x27;ITSM systems&#x27; include FreshService, ServiceNow and Samanage. Software vendors whose ITSM tools fulfill defined functional requirements to support a set of ITIL processes, can obtain official approval, allowing them to use Axelos trademarks and an &quot;ITIL process compliant&quot; logo, under Axelos&#x27; ITIL Software Endorsement scheme.

===Service desk===
A service desk is a primary IT function within the discipline of IT service management (ITSM) as defined by ITIL. It is intended to provide a &quot;Single Point of Contact&quot; (SPOC) to meet the communication needs of both users and IT staff, and also to satisfy both Customer and IT Provider objectives. &quot;User&quot; refers to the actual user of the service, while &quot;customer&quot; refers to the entity that is paying for the service. ITSM tools are frequently applied to other aspects of business, this practice is often called enterprise service management (ESM). One of the big pushes in ITSM is automation of mundane tasks, this allows people who perform these tasks to take on more critical tasks, this process called IT process automation.

The ITIL approach considers the service desk to be the central point of contact between service providers and users/customers on a day-to-day basis. It is also a focal point for reporting &quot;incidents&quot; (disruptions or potential disruptions in service availability or quality) and for users making &quot;service requests&quot; (routine requests for services).

ITIL regards a call centre or help desk as similar kinds of tech support which provide only a portion of what a service desk can offer. A service desk has a more broad and user-centered approach which is designed to provide the user with an informed single point of contact for all IT requirements. A service desk seeks to facilitate the integration of business processes into the service management infrastructure. In addition to actively monitoring and owning incidents and user questions, and providing the communications channel for other service management disciplines with the user community, a service desk also provides an interface for other activities such as customer change requests, third parties (e.g. maintenance contracts), and software licensing. Computer emergency response teams (CERT) are specifically dedicated computer security incidents.

==Frameworks==

As a discipline, ITSM has ties and common interests with other IT and general management approaches, information security management and software engineering. Consequently, IT service management frameworks have been influenced by other standards and adopted concepts from them, e.g. CMMI, ISO 9000, or ISO/IEC 27000.

Various frameworks for ITSM and overlapping disciplines include:
* ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a set of detailed practices for IT activities such as IT service management (ITSM) and IT asset management (ITAM) that focus on aligning IT services with the needs of business. 
* TOGAF is a framework and methodology that aims to define business goals while aligning them with architecture objectives related to software development.
* Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a process framework for telecommunications service providers.
* COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) is an IT Governance framework that specifies control objectives, metrics and maturity models. Recent versions have aligned the naming of select control objectives to established ITSM process names.
* FitSM is a standard for lightweight service management. It contains several parts, including e.g. auditable requirements and document templates, which are published under Creative Common licenses. Its basic process framework is in large parts aligned to that of ISO/IEC 20000.
* CMMI, guides all types of service providers to establish, manage, and improve services to meet business goals.
* ASL&#x27;s goal is the professional development of application management. This is achieved by offering a framework within which the processes of application management are brought in relation to each other.
* USM, the principle-based USM method provides a standardized management system for a service organization to manage its people, its processes, its technology, and its services, based on an explicit service management architecture.USM specifies the management system that supports the practice-based frameworks and standards and is adopted by Dutch government for its management architecture.
* ISO/IEC 20000 is an international standard for managing and delivering IT services. Its process model bears many similarities to that of ITIL version 2, since BS 15000 (precursor of ISO/IEC 20000) and ITIL were mutually aligned up to version 2 of ITIL. ISO/IEC 20000 defines minimum requirements for an effective &quot;service management system&quot; (SMS). Conformance of the SMS to ISO/IEC can be audited and organizations can achieve an ISO/IEC 20000 certification of their SMS for a defined scope.
* BiSL is a framework of best practices for the Information Management domain.
* MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework) includes, in addition to a general framework of service management functions, guidance on managing services based on Microsoft technologies.

==Professional organizations==
There are international, chapter-based professional associations, such as the IT Service Management Forum (itSMF), and HDI. The main goal of these organizations is to foster the exchange of experiences and ideas between users of ITSM frameworks. To this end, national and local itSMF and HDI chapters (LIGs or local interest groups for itSMF) organize conferences and workshops. Some of them also contribute to the translations of ITSM framework documents into their respective languages or publish their own ITSM guides. There are several certifications for service management like ITILv4, TOGAF or COBIT.

<text>Mahmut Celâlettin &quot;Celâl&quot; Bayar (16 May 1883 – 22 August 1986) was a Turkish economist and politician who was the third president of Turkey from 1950 to 1960; previously he was the prime minister of Turkey from 1937 to 1939. 

Bayar began his career in the Committee of Union and Progress, establishing its Izmir and Bursa branches. Following the declaration of the Republic, he founded much of Turkey&#x27;s early financial institutions, including the country&#x27;s first bank, İş Bankası. An advocate of liberal economic policies, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk appointed Bayar prime minister in 1937 to liberalize the economy, until he resigned in 1939 under Atatürk&#x27;s successor, İsmet İnönü. 

Until 1945, he was a member of Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) which was the sole legal party. In 1946, he founded the Democrat Party along with Adnan Menderes, Fuat Köprülü and Refik Koraltan beginning Turkey&#x27;s multiparty period, which still goes on to this day. A peaceful transfer of power from the CHP to DP happened in the 1950 elections, after which Bayar as elected Turkey&#x27;s third president. He was re-elected in 1954 and 1957, serving for 10 years as president. In that period, Menderes was his prime minister. He was overthrown and incarcerated after the 1960 coup d&#x27;etat, and advocated for the restoration of rights of former politicians associated with the Democrat Party following his release. 

He is considered to be the longest-lived former head of state and was the longest-lived state leader until 8 December 2008 (when he was surpassed by Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum). Celâl Bayar died on 22 August 1986 at the age of 103 after a brief illness.

==Early years==
Mahmut Celâlettin (Bayar after 1934) was born on 16 May 1883 at Umurbey, a village of Gemlik, Bursa, the third son of Abdullah Fehmi Efendi, religious leader and teacher who migrated from Lom, Ottoman Bulgaria as a muhacir, after the Bulgarians ethnically cleansed the Muslim population there during the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish war. His older brothers were Behzat and Asım. He first worked at the Gemlik Régie Company and in the court clerk’s office, and later at the Ziraat Bank in Bursa. Following this, he took up a position at Deutsche Orientbank. During his years in Bursa, he attended courses at the &quot;Collège Français de l&#x27;Assomption&quot;, managed by French priests, as well as silk production training at &quot;Dârütta‘lîm-i Harîr&quot;.

== In the CUP ==

In 1907, Bayar joined an unofficial branch of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) in Bursa. After the Second Constitutional Era was proclaimed following the Young Turk Revolution, he served as the secretary-general of a newly founded local branch of the organization, with instructions to organize Unionist infrastructure in Anatolia. Bayar formed a Unionist militia in Bursa with the intention to join up with Mahmud Shevket Pasha&#x27;s Action Army during the 31 March Incident. He got as far as Mudanya but by then the revolt was crushed. He then founded the İzmir branch of Union and Progress in 1911. Bayar established an organization and CUP mouthpiece known as &quot;Halkın Doğru&quot; (True to the People), where he wrote pro-CUP articles under the pseudonym Turgut Alp. He was a participant of the 1913 Ottoman coup d&#x27;état, and witnessed the murder of the Minister of War Nazım Pasha. 

Well connected with financial circles, Bayar played an important role in Unionist &quot;Millî İktisat&quot; (National Economy) policies. He was a member of the Special Organization and worked alongside Eşref Sencer Kuşçubaşı to help organize the 1914 Greek deportations in order to reduce the Ottoman Greek population on the Aegean coast. He initiated the opening of İzmir Girls&#x27; High School, the Şimendifer Vocational School in Basmahane, and a library in İzmir. Bayar also played an important role in the creation of the İzmir based sports club Altay S.K.

== War of Independence ==

Following the Armistice of Mudros, which ended World War I for the Ottomans, he was tried and acquitted as a war criminal at the İzmir Martial Law Court. However, when the allied powers continued advancing into Ottoman territory despite the armistice, various nationalist organizations known as Defence of National Rights Associations started to be founded. Bayar created the Association for the Cancellation of İzmir&#x27;s Annexation (&quot;İzmir Redd-i İlhak Cemiyeti&quot;) and the Association for the Defence of Ottoman İzmir (&quot;İzmir Müdâfaa-i Hukuku Osmaniye Cemiyeti&quot;). Bayar fled into the mountains after hearing rumors of an impending allied occupation of İzmir and finding out his name was on an arrest list from the Freedom and Accord government in Constantinople. Once İzmir was occupied, he cooperated with the national resistance fighters in the Söke region. On the side of the resistance, he participated in the Battle of Aydın against the Greeks. With the decision of the Balıkesir Congress, he was appointed to the command of the Akhisar front regiment.

Bayar was elected to the Ottoman Parliament as deputy of Saruhan (today Manisa) in the 1919 election, where he gave speeches denouncing the palace&#x27;s indifference to allied occupation. Following the occupation of Constantinople, he fled to Ankara to join Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) Pasha and the Turkish Independence Movement. While on the road the Anzavur rebellion threatened Bursa, so Mustafa Kemal asked Bayar to stay in Bursa to fend the rebels off. He was briefly a member of the Green Army Organization and the Turkish Communist Party, a foax communist party set up by Mustafa Kemal to counter the influence of the Communist Party of Turkey. 

He became the deputy of Bursa in the newly established Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The same year, he served as deputy minister of the economy and ın 1921 he was appointed as the minister of the economy. He led the negotiation commission during Çerkes Ethem&#x27;s uprising. In 1922, Bayar was a member of the Turkish delegation during the Lausanne Peace Conference as an advisor to İsmet İnönü.

== One-party period ==

Bayar was elected as a member of the Association for the Defence of National Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia (ADNRAR) in the 1923 election, serving as a deputy of İzmir in the Parliament. ADNRAR soon renamed itself Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) and continued a one party state started by the CUP in 1913. On 6 March 1924 Celâl Bayar was appointed Minister of Exchange Construction and Settlement (until 7 July 1924). Bayar was influential in determining the economic policy of the regime as a result of being in Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s close circle during this period. A policy of a modern and state supported capitalism was pursued. On 26 August 1924, Atatürk commissioned Bayar to found a national bank, which resulted in the foundation of İşbank in Ankara by using as capital the gold bullion sent by the Muslims in India to support the Turkish War of Independence. The Aşar tax was abolished, land was distributed, the &quot;Teşvik-i Sanayi Kanunu&quot; (Industry Incentive Law) was enacted, railway construction was accelerated, and the Central Bank was established. The effects of the Great Depression caused this more &quot;liberal&quot; policy to be replaced by statism. 

During his teneurship as economic minister (between 1932 and 1937), Bayar became one of the leading advocates of statism. Bayar understood statism as an effective tool in the creation of a nationalist and capitalist economy. Bayar&#x27;s term as economic minister saw an increase in regulatory interventions in the economy by the state, and high levels of industrialization. For this purpose, the First Five-Year Industry Plan was enacted. Institutions such as Sümerbank and Etibank were established to finance industrialization. Nationalizations, protectionist economic policies, and many state monopolies were created. However İsmet İnönü was in favor of an even stricter statism, and could not fully agree with his economic policies. 

On 1 November 1937 Atatürk appointed Bayar as Prime Minister of the 9th Government of Turkey after İnönü left the government. During the Bayar government, the Denizbank Law, which continued the statist approach, was enacted and several nationalizations were made. However there was no significant change in the composition of the government nor a significant change in economic policy. He continued to serve as prime minister when Atatürk died and İnönü became president in 1938 (10th government of Turkey). Differences of opinion with İnönü led him to resign from the premiership on 25 January 1939. The rivalry between İnönü and Bayar became one of the most significant rivalries in Turkish history.

== Creation of the Democrat Party ==

During the Second World War, Bayar&#x27;s political activity was limited; though he was re-elected as a member of parliament, he shunned from the cabinet. After 1943, he took a moderate opposition to the government. 

The end of World War II brought about a global wave of democracy, which resumed the power struggle in the one-party regime between the two versions of statism espoused by İnönü and Bayar. Opposition to the CHP administration surfaced during the voting of the 1945 Budget Law; Bayar, Adnan Menderes, Fuat Köprülü, Refik Koraltan, and Emin Sazak voted against the bill in the voting held for the seven-month budget of the Şükrü Saracoğlu government. The division within the party became more evident on 7 June 1945, when Bayar, Menderes, Koraltan and Köprülü submitted a motion to the chairmanship of the CHP Parliamentary Group asking for &quot;amendments to the Party&#x27;s statute and some laws&quot;, known as the &quot;motion with four signatures&quot;. The motion demanded political liberalization in the country and in the party, but was soundly rejected by the members of the CHP Central Council. On 21 September 1945 the CHP Council unanimously expelled Köprülü and Menderes from the party, and after a short time Koraltan. Bayar resigned from his parliamentary position in September 1945 and from the CHP in December 1945. On 7 January 1946 the four founded the Democrat Party (DP) and Bayar was elected as the leader of the party. The party program of the DP featured Bayar style approaches to economic policy, political democratization, decreasing the power of the bureaucracy, and encouraging private initiative while maintaining the principle of statism.

DP achieved relative success against CHP in 1946 election and elected 62 deputies. Bayar was also elected as a deputy from İstanbul. Between 1946 and 1950, as the leader of the opposition, he led a sometimes hardened opposition to his former party. At the first congress of the DP in January 1947, Bayar demanded that the Election Law be amended, so that the same person cannot be both president and party chairman, and that other antidemocratic laws should be abolished. Although the DP was supported by religious circles who were dissatisfied with the effective secularism policy of the one-party period, Bayar&#x27;s Kemalist background was seen as an assurance of the party&#x27;s commitment to secularism. But he was among the moderates in the DP regarding the opposition to the CHP. The &quot;extremists&quot; later left the party and founded the Nation Party (which would be closed in 1953). 

== Presidency ==
In the first free elections in Turkish history, the Democrats won the 1950 general election with a 53% popular mandate. Though Bayar didn&#x27;t aspire to become president, parliament elected him as president of Turkey on 22 May 1950. He subsequently resigned from the DP leadership, though regularly discussed policy with his prime minister and DP leader successor, Menderes. He was the first president of the Republic without a military background. He was also the first to do away with a non-partisan appearance, participating in election rallies and walking with a cane with an engraving of the DP logo. He was re-elected in 1954 and 1957, serving for 10 years as president. 

During Bayar&#x27;s presidency relations with the Western bloc improved and after the Turkish Straits Crisis, Turkey joined the Korean War in 1951 and then NATO in February 1952. Bayar became the first president of Turkey to make an official visit to the United States in 1954. In a speech at a DP rally in İstanbul before the 1957 election, he announced that &quot;Turkey will become a &quot;Little America&quot; in 30 years.

During ten-years of Democrat rule, Turkish society went through deep transformations. An inflationary economic policy encouraging private enterprise was followed, though the role of the state was not reduced. Political participation increased, leading to a large cadre of Anatolians entering politics and business. Although secularism was not abandoned, the explicitly secularist policy of the one-party regime was abandoned. In the second half of the 1950s, with the impact of the economic depression, the DP pursued increasingly authoritarian policies and put heavy pressure on the opposition. It was under his presidency that the İstanbul Pogrom took place on 6–7 September 1955. Bayar also had a decisive influence in encouraging authoritarianism by the Democrats.

== 1960 coup and imprisonment ==
On 27 May 1960 the armed forces staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. Bayar first tried to resist the officers who came to arrest him at Çankaya Mansion on the morning of the coup and then tried to commit suicide by holding the pistol in his jacket pocket to his temple. However, the soldiers were more agile than the 77-year-old Bayar and managed to take the gun from him. Bayar was arrested along with other Democrats, and was tried at the High Court of Justice in Yassıada on charges of &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;violating the constitution&quot;. He tried to commit suicide again with a waist belt while he was imprisoned in Yassıada but failed. He was sentenced to death on 15 September 1961. The National Unity Committee approved the death sentence for Menderes, Zorlu, and Polatkan, but the punishment for Bayar and other twelve party members was commuted to life imprisonment. Bayar was transferred from Yassıada to Kayseri Prison but he was released on 7 November 1964 due to ill health.

Due to ill health he was brought to Ankara for treatment on 14 February 1962 and was taken back to prison in Kayseri five days later. Under pressure from ex-DP supporters, Bayar&#x27;s sentence was suspended by the government for a period of six months due to his health issues and he was released on 22 March 1963. Bayar came to Ankara the next day, and was greeted by a large convoy and crowd. This enthusiastic welcome caused chaos in the streets, with protests going so far as vandalizing the headquarters of the successor of the DP, the Justice Party, Bayar&#x27;s house, and the newspaper headquarters of &quot;Yeni İstanbul&quot;. Concerns arose that the Justice Party would be shut down. The decision was eventually made to postpone Bayar&#x27;s release from prison on 28 March. After being under surveillance in Ankara Hospital for 6 months, he was sent back to Kayseri Prison (5 October 1963), although there was no change in his health status.

He remained in Kayseri Prison until 8 November 1964, when he was released once more for health reasons. He was pardoned by president Cevdet Sunay on 8 July 1966. With a new amnesty law enacted by the Justice Party government on 8 August 1966, all former DP members, including those sentenced to life imprisonment, were freed.

== Later years and death ==

Restoring ex-Democrats full political rights was a divisive issue in Turkey during the 1960s. After being pardoned, Bayar worked to restore the political rights of former DP members. In 1968, he founded a club called &quot;Bizim Ev&quot; (Our Home), which aimed to bring together ex-Democrats who lost their political rights. He held a historic meeting with his political rival İnönü on 14 May 1969 that lead to CHP passing a constitutional amendment which returned suspended rights to former DP members. This amendment offended Sunay and the army, and also divided the Justice Party, resulting in the birth of the Democratic Party in 1970 (which Bayar supported). 

Full political rights were restored to Bayar in 1974, but he declined an invitation to become a life member of the Senate, on the grounds that one can represent the people only if elected. When a large group of Democratic Party members returned to the Justice Party after the amnesty was granted, Bayar also supported the Justice Party in the 1975 Senate partial elections; He took to the podium together with Süleyman Demirel and spoke at the Justice Party rally held in Bursa. He supported the 1980 military junta and the 1982 Constitution. He turned 100 on 16 May 1983.

He died on 22 August 1986 in Istanbul at the age of 103 after a brief illness. There was debate over burying Bayar in Anıtkabir like his old rival İsmet İnönü was, this was advocated by Motherland (ANAP) party leader Turgut Özal and SHP leader Erdal İnönü, İsmet&#x27;s son. However President Kenan Evren objected and Bayar was buried in his hometown of Umurbey after a state ceremony in Ankara, at which Evren was in attendance. From 24 April 1978, when former Paraguayan President Federico Chávez died, until his own death Bayar was the world&#x27;s oldest living former head of state.

===Awards and legacy===
In 1954, Bayar was awarded the Grand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (German&quot;: Sonderstufe des Großkreuzes des Verdienstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland&quot;). 27 January 1954 Bayar received the Legion of Merit Award from the President of the United States, as a result of Turkey&#x27;s participation in the Korean War. He also received the Order of the Yugoslav Star. In 1954, Bayar was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Belgrade. In 1958, the Free University of Berlin awarded him an honorary doctorate. The Celal Bayar University, which was established in 1992 in Manisa, is named after him.

He went to the Gulf of Mexico as Commanding Officer of the gunboat at the beginning of 1862. In &quot;Pinola&quot;, assisted by , he broke the chain barrier across the Mississippi to make possible the passage upriver of Flag Officer David Farragut&#x27;s squadron, and the capture of New Orleans.

Spike Jonze is amongst the camera operators for the concert recording, and he is also featured in interviews on the DVD, as is director, Lance Bangs.

Michelle Zauner (Japanese Breakfast) described the influence of the concert: “My friend had the DVD of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live at the Fillmore. Seeing Karen O for the first time changed my life. She spat water all over herself and used the microphone in ways I had never seen before... Finding out that she was half-Korean in the super white male dominated industry was just mind blowing. It was such a life-changing moment for me... I felt so connected to her and she was such an important role model in my life.”

<doc id="1132236" wikidata="Q2909434" url="?curid=1132236" title="Boliviana negra">
<text>Boliviana negra, also known as &quot;supercoca&quot; or &quot;la millionaria&quot;, is a form of coca (&quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot;) that is purportedly resistant to the herbicide glyphosate. The coca plant is the source of the potentially addictive stimulant cocaine, a prescription drug and one of the most widely consumed illegal drugs in the world and the source of large amounts of money to various criminal organizations. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the multibillion-dollar aerial coca eradication campaign undertaken by the government of Colombia with U.S. financial and military backing known as Plan Colombia.

== Herbicide resistance ==
The herbicide resistance of this strain has at least two possible explanations: that a “peer-to-peer” network of coca farmers used selective breeding to enhance this trait through tireless effort, or the plant was genetically modified in a laboratory. In 1996, a patented Roundup Ready or glyphosate-resistant soybean was marketed by Monsanto Company, suggesting that it would be possible to genetically modify coca in an analogous manner. Spraying Boliviana Negra with glyphosate would serve to strengthen its growth by eliminating the non-resistant weeds surrounding it. Joshua Davis, in &quot;Wired&quot;, found no evidence of CP4 EPSPS, a protein produced by the Roundup Ready soybean, suggesting Bolivana Negra was not created in a laboratory but by selective breeding in the fields.

A fungal plant pathogen, &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;, has been suggested as a possible successor to glyphosate, both similarly are hazards to humans and other plant species.

<doc id="1132237" wikidata="Q4970921" url="?curid=1132237" title="British Rail Classes 485 and 486">
<text>The British Rail Class 485 (or 4Vec, later 5Vec) and British Rail Class 486 (or 3Tis, later 2Tis) electrical multiple units were originally built for the London Electric Railway from 1923-31 as its &#x27;Standard&#x27; tube stock. They were purchased by British Rail in 1967 and transported to the Isle of Wight to work &#x27;mainline&#x27; services on the newly electrified Ryde to Shanklin line, where they worked for an additional quarter of a century. At the time of their purchase the units had already worked for over 40 years on the London Underground, but their introduction allowed the last steam locomotives on the line to be withdrawn.

== History ==
Six four-car sets and six three-car sets were refurbished by BR&#x27;s Stewarts Lane depot in 1966-67. The four-car sets were initially classified Class 452 and numbered 041-046, later reclassified Class 485 and numbered 485041-046. Each unit was formed of a driving motor, two intermediate trailers, and a second driving motor. Thus, the formation was DMBSO+TSO+TSO+DMBSO. Some of the intermediate trailers were former driving trailers, with the cabs locked out of use.

The three-car sets were classified Class 451 and numbered 031-036, later reclassified Class 486 and numbered 486031-036. A spare driving motor car was also refurbished, given the unit number 486037. Each of these units were formed of a driving motor, an intermediate trailer, and a driving trailer. Thus, the formation was DMBSO+TSO+DTSO.

When introduced, the units carried all-over BR blue livery. This progressed to standard blue/grey livery in the 1970s, and finally some units received Network SouthEast&#x27;s blue livery with red and white stripes, following its introduction in 1986.

Electric services on the Isle of Wight commenced on 20 March 1967. In service, the 4Vec units often worked alone, but sometimes in combination with a 3Tis unit, such that a train was formed of seven coaches known as a 7 Vectis. (&quot;Vectis&quot; was the Roman name for the Isle of Wight.)

==Reformation==
In 1985, the Class 485 units were reformed into five 5 car (5Vec) units, and the Class 486 units into two 2 car (2tis) units.

==Withdrawal==
Due to the proximity to the sea, the units suffered badly from corrosion damage. By the mid-1980s it was clear that they needed to be replaced. The replacements came from the two-car Class 483, which were also rebuilt from former London Underground stock, namely 1938 tube stock. These new units were introduced from 1989. The last 2Tis and 5Vec units were withdrawn from service in 1992.

Upon retirement from Isle of Wight services, no 486 units were saved for preservation. However, several 485 vehicles were sold back to London Underground for eventual restoration as part of an operational &#x27;Standard&#x27; stock museum unit. These are listed below:
Of these five cars, only DTSO 5279 and TSO 7296 have been preserved, all the other cars were scrapped in Acton works in 2013 alongside other old Standard Stock Cars. During November 2011 the two long-stored DM vehicles 2 and 7 were despatched by LU to Eastleigh depot for component recovery and subsequent breaking up: this is believed to have occurred in December 2011 (although this has not been confirmed). Trailers 27 and 49 are incorporated into the LT museum&#x27;s Standard stock museum train. Trailer 44 was scrapped in August 2012.

<text>Auxi-le-Château (; ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France.

==Geography==
A farming town located 28 miles (45 km) west south west of Arras at the junction of the D938, D933 and D941 roads. The Authie river flows through the town, which once divided the commune into two parts, one in the Pas-de-Calais and the other in the Somme department. It is so named because it was a border fort, but there is now no sign of a castle, apart from some ruins at the top of the Chemin de la Belle Inutile.

==Population==
==History==
Until the abolition of the Provinces of France in 1791, Auxi-le-Château was part of the province of Picardy.

<text>Millicent &quot;Millie&quot; Buckridge Tant is a fictional comic strip character in the British comic &quot;Viz&quot;.

She is a caricature of a left-wing militant feminist. She thinks of herself as a champion of &quot;wimmin&#x27;s&quot; rights but is often self-centred and dismissive of the feelings of others. She rants, raises her fist in the air and foams at the mouth. She often refers to men as &quot;phallocrats&quot; and &quot;potential rapists&quot; or just &quot;rapists&quot;, referring to other women as &quot;fellow lesbians&quot; regardless of their sexual orientation. Most of the storylines seem to indicate sexual frustration.

She often complains that various phenomena are metaphors for the suppression of women: fireworks are &quot;big explosive penises&quot; that &quot;skewer and rape the virgin female sky&quot;. She refuses to make a snowman, instead offering to make a snow-black-lesbian-rape-victim-in-a-wheelchair. She plays cards with an old woman and ends the game by calling her a homophobe because she said &quot;straight flush&quot;. In the end she often forgets her feminist stance and is shown asking a man to get rid of a mouse while she is standing on a chair, or knitting baby clothes.

<text>Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville, Marquis Duquesne (c. 1700 17 September 1778) was a French Governor General of New France. He was born in Toulon, France.

Duquesne served from 1752 to 1755. Best known for his role in the French and Indian War, he established Fort Duquesne in 1755 at the confluence of the Allegheny and the Monongahela Rivers at what is now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was named after him. It was abandoned by French forces in 1758 with the arrival of the much more powerful British Forbes Expedition, which erected Fort Pitt in its place.

He built a line of defensive fortifications to strengthen the French presence. He later returned to France.

==Battle of Cartagena==

In 1758, he led a French squadron out of Toulon, intended to relieve another French squadron which had been sailing to Louisbourg to provide relief to the defenders there, but had been forced into Cartagena in neutral Spain. However, Duquesne was attacked by a British force led by Henry Osborne and two of his ships were captured, including his own flagship. The ultimate result of the action was to deny Louisbourg any chance of relief, and it surrendered later in the year.

He died in 1778 in Antony, Hauts-de-Seine.

Duquesne University was named after him.

<text>The Jamaican boa, Jamaican yellow boa or yellow snake (Chilabothrus subflavus; in Jamaican Patois: ) is a boa species endemic to Jamaica. No subspecies are recognized. Like all other boas, it is not venomous.

==Description==
The Jamaican boa is golden-green around the head and along the anterior section of the body, with black zigzag crossbars, becoming black toward the posterior end of its body. The snake&#x27;s body is quite long, up to in total length.

== Behavior ==

The Jamaican boa is primarily nocturnal and arboreal. The species may also display crepuscular activity, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, prey availability, and seasonal activities. During daytime, this species seeks shelter in various locations such as epiphytes, trees, rock crevices, termite nests, or caves. It has been observed at the far end of Portland Cave. This species is also known to bask on rocks following heavy rains and to rest on roads and trails during the evening, suggesting crepuscular behavior under certain conditions.

==Distribution and habitat==
Found in Jamaica in the Cockpit Country, historically once prevalent throughout much of Jamaica, notably in rural areas, as well as some smaller adjacent islands, such as Goat Islands. However, after the introduction of the small Indian mongoose (&quot;Herpestes auropunctatus&quot;) in 1872, sightings of the snake on the mainland dropped. The snake is known to be elusive, which further complicates its detection.

Recent surveys have failed to confirm the snake&#x27;s presence on Great Goat Island, an area dominated by dry limestone forest. Comprehensive island-wide surveys have been conducted, indicating the snake&#x27;s presence in various parishes such as Trelawny, St. Anne, Westmoreland, and Hanover.

The Jamaican boa is now confined to approximately 1,000.6 km2, about 9% of Jamaica&#x27;s land area. Habitat fragmentation and human activities have localized and severely fragmented the population. Major strongholds for the boa now appear to be Cockpit Country, Blue Mountains, Yallah Mountains, Hellshire Hills, and Portland Bight, which together account for 93% of the known habitat of the species.

== Foraging and diet ==

The foraging behavior of the Jamaican boa is not extensively studied, but the species is known to be an ecological generalist. It employs constriction to subdue and consume a diverse range of prey. The snake utilizes both active and ambush foraging strategies, which vary depending on the habitat structure, available food resources, and its life stage. For instance, it has been observed hanging from branches and vines to prey on emerging bats in the evening.

Birds, particularly black-billed parrots (&quot;Amazona agilis&quot;) and yellow-billed parrots (&quot;Amazona collaria&quot;), are significant prey items for the Jamaican boa. This species is also a leading cause of nest failure for these endemic bird species, particularly in forest edge habitats. Invasive cane toads (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;) are also preyed upon, although their toxins can be fatal to the snake. This species will occasionally enters human dwellings and agricultural areas to hunt for rats and chickens. In captivity, the diet often consists of rats for juveniles and adults, while neonates are typically fed chicks or pre-killed, frozen house mice. These mice are often treated with scents from chicks, lizards, or frogs to stimulate consumption.

== Ecological niche ==

The Jamaican boa is considered a top predator in its ecosystem. It engages in both active and ambush predation, often using vines and tank bromeliads (&quot;Aechmea paniculigera&quot;) for mobility and camouflage. Observations indicate that the species actively preys on flycatcher nests (&quot;Tyrannidae&quot;). It has also been identified as a predator of Black-billed amazons (&quot;Amazona agilis&quot;) and Yellow-billed amazons (&quot;A. collaria&quot;) in Cockpit Country, Jamaica.

While there is no published data on the species&#x27; relative abundance in Jamaica, research suggests that Black-Billed Parrots experience higher rates of nest predation in ecotones compared to forest habitats. This may indicate a correlation between the foraging ecology of the Jamaican boa and edge habitats in Cockpit Country.

Limited information is available on the foraging behavior of the Jamaican boa inside cave systems. Aggressive interactions between male individuals of this species have only been documented in captivity. Additionally, increased levels of aggression from females toward conspecifics have been observed under specific conditions.

==Conservation status==
The Jamaican boa&#x27;s natural populations greatly and constantly declined since the late 19th century, mainly because of predation by introduced species (such as mongooses), human persecution, and habitat destruction. In-situ conservation of the Jamaican boa is seriously hindered by the lack of information on demographic and ecological parameters as well as by a poor understanding of the population structure and species distribution in the wild. This species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: A2ce (v2.3, 1994). A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that a population decline of 20% is expected within the next ten years or three generations, whichever is the longer, due to a decline in the quality and area of occupancy. It is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Year assessed: 1996.

Their natural habitat is being destroyed, which is forcing them into inhabited areas, where they are captured and killed. Some measures have been taken to afford these animals some protection:
* Listed as a Protected Species under the Wild Life Protection Act (1945).
* Listed on Appendix I of CITES.
* Hunting in forest reserves is also prohibited under the Forest Act (1996).

<text>Texas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district of the United States House of Representatives is in the southeastern portion of the state of Texas. It encompasses parts of northern and eastern Harris County and southern Montgomery County, Texas.

From 2002 to 2012, it stretched from Houston&#x27;s northern suburbs through eastern Harris County, and across Southeast Texas to the Louisiana border. As of the 2000 census, the 2nd district represented 651,619 people. The district&#x27;s configuration dates from the 2003 Texas redistricting, when most of the old 9th district was split among three neighboring districts. The four-term Democratic incumbent in the 9th district, Nick Lampson, was unseated by Republican Ted Poe, a longtime felony-court judge in Harris County. In November 2017, Poe announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and did not seek re-election in 2018. Dan Crenshaw was elected on November 6, 2018 and is currently serving as congressman.

==2012 redistricting==
The 2012 redistricting process radically changed the district. Beaumont, which had been part of the 2nd and its predecessors for over a century, was removed along with all of Jefferson County. All of Liberty County was removed as well, putting the district entirely within Harris County. The district now includes Kingwood, Humble, and Atascocita in northeastern Harris County.

== Recent election results from statewide races ==
== Composition ==
For the 118th and successive Congresses (based on redistricting following the 2020 census), the district contains all or portions of the following counties and communities:

Harris County (11)

: Atascocita (part; also 18th), Barrett, Baytown (part; also 36th), Channelview (part; also 29th and 36th), Crosby, Highlands, Houston (part; also 7th, 8th, 9th, 18th, 22nd, 29th, 36th, 38th; shared with Fort Bend and Montgomery counties), Humble (part; also 18th and 29th), Sheldon, Spring, The Woodlands (part; also 8th; shared with Montgomery County)

Montgomery County (14)

: Cleveland, Conroe (part; also 8th), Deerwood, Grangerland (part; also 8th), Houston (part; also 7th, 8th, 9th, 18th, 22nd, 29th, 36th, 38th; shared with Fort Bend and Harris counties), Oak Ridge North, Patton Village, Porter Heights, Roman Forest, Shenandoah, Splendora, Woodbranch, The Woodlands (part; also 8th; shared with Harris County), Woodloch

<text>Bosom Buddies is an American television sitcom starring Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari created by Robert L. Boyett, Thomas L. Miller and Chris Thompson. It aired on Thursday nights for two seasons on ABC from November 27, 1980, to March 27, 1982, and in reruns in the summer of 1984 on NBC. The show features the misadventures of two single men, working in creative advertising, struggling in their industry while disguising themselves as women in order to live in the one apartment they could afford. Gender stereotypes and male/female interpersonal relationships were frequent themes.

The show became known for its quirky humor and its frequent use of improvisation, especially between stars Hanks and Scolari. Though the show started out with good ratings, it failed to hold the public&#x27;s interest and was canceled after two seasons.

The show is now best known for launching the career of Hanks, who became an Oscar-winning film star.

==Premise==

In the pilot episode, after their own apartment is demolished while they are still asleep in it, two men disguise themselves as women in order to live in the dirt-cheap Susan B. Anthony Hotel, which happens to be female-only. Kip Wilson (Hanks) is originally skeptical of the plan, but after meeting gorgeous resident model/dancer/nurse Sonny Lumet (Donna Dixon), he ends up convincing aspiring writer Henry Desmond (Scolari) that the experience will make a great book. Their co-worker, Amy Cassidy (Wendie Jo Sperber), who is attracted to Henry, is the only resident in on the plan. The boys’ deception includes outwitting the hotel manager, Darlene (Edie Adams), and fellow resident, Isabelle Hammond (Telma Hopkins), an aspiring singer. When the pilot sold to ABC, the character of Darlene was replaced by Lilly Sinclair (Lucille Benson).

In the first season, Kip, Henry, and Amy work for Ruth Dunbar (Holland Taylor) at the Manhattan-based advertising firm of Livingston, Gentry &amp; Mishkin, where Kip is a graphic artist, Henry is a copy writer, and Amy is the receptionist. Ruth often takes credit for the boys’ work when reporting to her (unseen) boss, Mr. Rubinowitz.

The show was barely renewed for a second season. In order to improve the mediocre ratings of the first season, revise the format, and at the same time, do some cost-cutting, it was decided that the part of Lilly Sinclair was superfluous and was written out. As a result, veteran actress Lucille Benson left the series and Telma Hopkins&#x27; character of Isabelle became the new hotel manager. Kip, Henry and Amy left Livingston, Gentry &amp; Mishkin to start their own advertising firm, Sixty Seconds Street, with Ruth serving as a not-quite-silent partner.

In the first episode of the second season, the male characters’ ruse of living in drag is revealed, but they are allowed to continue living at the women-only hotel anyway. Sonny forgives Kip for the deception, and Isabelle, the new hotel manager, agrees to go along with the ruse rather than admit it to the other residents. From this point on, the drag element was de-emphasized and the show moved closer to the creators&#x27; original concept of a regular buddy comedy.

==Production==
The series was conceived by Miller and Boyett as a male counterpart to their hit sitcom &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. They originally pitched it as a straightforward buddy comedy done in what they described as &quot;a sophisticated Billy Wilder kind of way.&quot; When ABC executives asked Miller and Boyett to explain what they meant by the comparison to Wilder, the producers mentioned &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (directed by Wilder) and ABC bought the show on condition that it would include men in women&#x27;s clothing, just like that movie. &quot;We weren&#x27;t there to pitch that,&quot; Miller recalled. &quot;And they jumped on it! We drove back to the studio in the car saying, &#x27;Oh my God, what are we gonna do? We have to do something in drag.

After the cast had been chosen, Miller and Boyett asked Chris Thompson, one of the writer-producers of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, to write the pilot and be the series showrunner. Thompson (who would go on to executive-produce such shows as &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;) said later that he took the job purely for the money, but unexpectedly found it to be &quot;my completely favorite experience in show business&quot;, because the network left him and his young cast free to experiment. &quot;We were left alone,&quot; he recalled. &quot;Nobody was paying attention to us. We were all really young, but it was like we had daddy&#x27;s Porsche. We had $500,000 to play with every week.&quot;

Although the series is set in New York, &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; was taped on Stage 25 at Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles. Stage 25 was also the home of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, and its spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;.

Like many other sitcoms that aired during the 1980–81 television season, &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; felt the effects of a strike by the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists that occurred in 1980. As a result, the show had an abbreviated first season. At first, its ratings were strong. However, ABC kept switching the show&#x27;s day and time slots, which hurt the first season&#x27;s overall standing. The second season, with its revised premise, fared even worse, and after more time slot changes by the network, the show was canceled in the spring of 1982.
Ironically, the last line of the series (season 2, episode 18 &quot;Not the Last Picture Show&quot;) was, &quot;You know, no matter how old I get now, I&#x27;ll never get tired of watching this.&quot;

&quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; was one of the last shows to use the Miller-Milkis-Boyett production team due to Eddie Milkis leaving the company in 1984. This was also one of the last Miller-Boyett sitcoms to be produced by Paramount Television (now CBS Television Studios) before they moved their base of operations to Lorimar Productions (later Warner Bros. Television); &quot;Happy Days&quot; ended its run in 1984, making the latter the last program to meet cancellation before the Miller-Boyett move to Lorimar, with &quot;Valerie&quot; being the first since to debut.

==Episodes==
While the pilot episode was shot on film, the rest of the series was shot on videotape.

=== Season 1 (1980–81) ===
=== Season 2 (1981–82) ===
==Theme song==
The theme song for the opening credits was Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;My Life&quot;, although it was a re-recorded version with Gary Bennett as the vocalist and Mike Lucas on piano. Some reruns shown in syndication (such as when USA Network aired reruns, as well as its later runs on MeTV) and all home video and DVD releases, use a vocal version of the show&#x27;s end credit instrumental theme, &quot;Shake Me Loose&quot;, performed by Stephanie Mills, for the opening credits, replacing &quot;My Life&quot;.

==Reruns==
NBC briefly aired reruns of &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; in the summer of 1984, after the successes of &quot;Splash&quot; and &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; had made Hanks a major film star. Ratings were good, but there was no possibility of Hanks returning for a revival of the show. Reruns also aired on the USA Network until November 18, 1995, as well as on TBS and TV Land until the mid-2000s. More recently, Weigel Broadcasting has aired the series on some of its networks, including MeTV, MeTV Plus, and Decades (now known as Catchy Comedy). Catchy Comedy aired a &quot;Catchy Binge&quot; of the series 3 times; first on the weekend of May 27–28, 2023, then again on the weekend of April 13–14, 2024, and now on January 12, 2025.

In the U.K., &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; was aired by Two ITV Companies LWT and TSW in the early &#x27;80s. The Paramount Channel repeated the series from November 1, 1995, to February 4, 2001.

==Home media==
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released both seasons of &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; on Region 1 DVD. The original theme song &quot;My Life&quot; by Billy Joel was replaced with &quot;Shake Me Loose&quot;, a song penned by show creator Chris Thompson, which was used during the show&#x27;s syndication run. Many of the musical numbers featured during the show&#x27;s run are edited or eliminated altogether from the DVD releases. Notable in this vein are the songs &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; (from the episode &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;), &quot;Chances Are&quot; (from &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;) and &quot;Rock and Roll Heaven&quot; (from &quot;Hildy&#x27;s Dirt Nap&quot;).

On February 6, 2018, CBS Home Entertainment released &quot;Bosom Buddies: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

==Pop-culture references==
A shot-for-shot remake of the show&#x27;s opening credits aired January 23, 2014, on Adult Swim as an installment of Adam Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Event in Television History&quot;. The parody was directed by Lance Bangs and Scott and features Paul Rudd playing Tom Hanks&#x27; character Kip, and Scott playing Peter Scolari&#x27;s character Henry. The theme song &quot;My Life&quot; by Billy Joel is actually sung by Joel instead of the sound-alike version used for the original TV series. In an extended mock &quot;making-of&quot; documentary preceding the opening credits remake, Hanks, Scolari, and Joel make cameo appearances.

In the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode &quot;100&quot;, Hanks makes a cameo appearance where he references &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; by singing lines from &quot;My Life&quot;.

<text>The Uliches or Ugliches ( or ; or , or ; , or ) were a tribe of Early East Slavs who, between the eighth and the tenth centuries, inhabited (along with the Tivertsi) Bessarabia, and the territories along the Lower Dnieper, Bug River and the Black Sea littoral.

==Ethnonym==
The tribal name comes from a location called Oglos or Onglos by the Byzantine chroniclers Theophanes the Confessor and Nikephoros I of Constantinople, possibly to be identified with Peuce Island. The word may derive from Slavic &quot;âgul&quot; &#x27;corner&#x27;, or, according to Steven Runciman, from &quot;agul&quot; &#x27;enclosure&#x27;.

==History==
They were mentioned as &quot;Unlizi&quot; by the Bavarian Geographer, described as &quot;populus multus&quot; and having 418 gords-settlements. The Uliches long struggled against the Kievan princes Oleg, Igor and Sviatoslav Igorevich for their independence, until a Kievan commander Sveneld captured their capital, Peresechen (near Orhei, in present-day Moldova), around 940. In the mid-10th century the Ulich lands paid tribute to Sveneld. The Uliches were last mentioned in the 970s.

<doc id="1132258" wikidata="Q950593" url="?curid=1132258" title="A Muppet Family Christmas">
<text>A Muppet Family Christmas is a Christmas musical television special starring Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets. It first aired on December 16, 1987, on the ABC television network in the United States. Its teleplay was conceived by longtime Muppet writer Jerry Juhl, and directed by Peter Harris and Eric Till (the latter of whom was uncredited). This television special was filmed at 9 Channel Nine Court in Toronto, Ontario. The special features various Muppets from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. It also stars Gerry Parkes as Doc from the North American wraparound segments of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and Henson as himself in a cameo appearance at the end. In the plot, the Muppets surprise Fozzie Bear&#x27;s mother with a Christmas visit to her farmhouse, unaware of her planned getaway to Malibu.

Due to licensing issues with songs featured in &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;, some scenes have been cut from subsequent home media releases.

==Plot==
Fozzie Bear is driving many of the Muppets to his mother Emily&#x27;s farm for Christmas while they all sing &quot;We Need a Little Christmas&quot;. Unbeknownst to Fozzie, Emily Bear is preparing to go to Malibu for the holiday and rent her farmhouse to Doc and Sprocket, who want to spend a nice quiet Christmas in the country. Doc and Sprocket have arrived when Fozzie and the other Muppets enter, disrupting Emily and Doc&#x27;s plans for the holidays. Just then, Miss Piggy calls to tell Kermit the Frog that she is at a photo session and will be late, making Kermit very worried.

Rowlf the Dog and the Swedish Chef arrive and they begin to prepare for Christmas as the Christmas Turkey works to avoid the Swedish Chef. Meanwhile, Fozzie builds a snowman outside and the snowman comes to life singing along with Fozzie and putting on a comedy act with him. After the performance, Fozzie goes into the house where he tells Kermit about his new act. This is interrupted by Miss Piggy calling again, when she tells Kermit that she is doing a little Christmas shopping before she goes to the farmhouse.

Sometime later, the gang watches a home movie of themselves as babies during their first Christmas together.

A group of carolers then arrive consisting of Big Bird, Ernie and Bert, and the rest of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets. All the Muppets continue to prepare for Christmas as the news comes on TV. The Muppet Newsman reports that the worst blizzard in 50 years is approaching the area. Kermit realizes that Miss Piggy is out in the storm and gets more worried about her.

Fozzie and Emily go over where everyone is going to sleep. Big Bird and Cookie Monster will sleep in the attic, Herry Monster will sleep in the bathtub, and Ernie and Bert will bunk with Kermit. When Fozzie asks about Oscar the Grouch, he states he&#x27;ll be “nicely miserable” in his trash can as Rizzo the Rat asks to bunk with him. Oscar agrees, stating that he’s never had a rat in his trash can before. The &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets perform a pageant of &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; where the Two-Headed Monster portrays Santa Claus. Kermit then gets a third call from Piggy stating that her limo got stuck in the snow and that she is calling for a taxi. After being tricked by the Christmas Turkey, the Swedish Chef tries to make a meal out of Big Bird, who is unaware of his intentions due to his naivety and young age, and soon finds himself unable to after Big Bird offers him chocolate-covered birdseed and sings &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; with him, and decides to serve something else. Fozzie approaches Kermit stating that now is a good time to show him his new comedy act with the Snowman, but their act is cut short no thanks to Statler and Waldorf who are friends with Emily.

Feeling some sympathy for Kermit, Doc offers to go out looking for Piggy. Kermit is called to the basement where he and his nephew Robin find a Fraggle Hole and the Fraggles.

Finally, after Piggy makes her grand entrance, riding a dogsled with Doc, all the Muppets sing a medley of carols and swap presents (except Oscar who just sits in his trash can sighing very miserably due to his hatred of Christmas). Doc then comes in dressed as Santa Claus giving presents to the Muppets.

The last part shows Jim Henson himself making a cameo appearance preparing to wash and dry the dishes with Sprocket. Meanwhile, Kermit and Piggy kiss under the mistletoe and wishing the home audience a Merry Christmas. Then the end credits roll.

==Production==
This is one of the very few Muppet productions to feature Muppets associated with all four of the major Muppet franchises as a crossover: &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; and &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; (who are seen as actual puppets here instead of animated counterparts). This special also features an onscreen guest cameo by Jim Henson; he can be seen in the kitchen doing dishes with Sprocket towards the end of the special. Additionally, the United Kingdom broadcast which aired on BBC One on 26 December 1989, marked the first appearance of Doc on British television, as the UK version of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; featured new &quot;Outer Space&quot; segments, in which Sprocket&#x27;s owner was a lighthouse keeper.

==Scenes omitted in North American DVD and VHS release==
&quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; has never been released in its entirety on either VHS or DVD in North America. Several songs were licensed specially to only air on TV, and thus had to be cut from home video versions.

* The original opening title (superimposed over a shot of Emily Bear&#x27;s house).
* The snowman and Fozzie&#x27;s comedy act while singing the song &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; when hearing Rowlf inside playing the piano.
* The home movie featuring Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and Scooter as babies singing &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; with baby Rowlf playing a toy piano.
* The Muppets sing &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;, after Miss Piggy&#x27;s grand belated arrival, then later &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day&quot; during the final medley.
* A brief shot of Fozzie Bear and Elmo lighting a Christmas tree.
* Fozzie tells his mother, Emily Bear, that he is too old to have a stocking hung for him, then changes his mind.

==Reception==
&quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; ranked 24th out of 69 shows in the Nielsen ratings the week it aired, with a 16.1 rating and a 25 share, and was watched by around 19.3 million viewers.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the special at number six on its &#x27;10 Best Family Holiday Specials&#x27; list. In his coverage of the special for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Myles McNutt stated that &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; is &quot;a love letter to the Muppets as a wide-ranging, meaningful part of viewers’ childhoods.&quot; He further praised the special&#x27;s emphasis on family and the Muppet characters over &quot;cheap celebrity cameos.&quot; Sean Edgar of &quot;Paste&quot; described the special as &quot;a grand culmination of the altruism that stands at the foundation of Henson’s oeuvre.&quot;

<doc id="1132262" wikidata="Q1091699" url="?curid=1132262" title="London Underground 1992 Stock">
<text>The London Underground 1992 Stock is a type of rolling stock used on the Central and Waterloo &amp; City lines of the London Underground. A total of 85 eight-car trains were built for the Central line and 5 four-car trains were built for the Waterloo &amp; City line.

== Construction ==
The 1992 Stock was built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) (under ABB) for the Central line following extensive testing of the three 1986 tube stock prototype trains. 

Eighty-five 8-car trains were ordered from BREL, each formed of four two-car units (two units had driving cabs, the others were fitted with shunting controls). Upon entering service in April 1993, the new trains gradually replaced the previous 1962 tube stock, which was completely withdrawn two years later. The trains were manufactured at the Derby Litchurch Lane Works.

The original propulsion for the trains was manufactured by a consortium of ABB and Brush Traction, and was one of the first examples of microprocessor-controlled traction featuring a fibre-optic network to connect the different control units. The DC traction motors of LT130 type have separately-excited fields and are controlled via GTO (Gate turn-off) thyristors. These would be the only tube trains to use this type of DC motor, and would be the last newly built train on the London Underground with DC motors, and the second to last in the United Kingdom, only succeeded by the Phase 3 MTR Metro Cammell EMUs in Hong Kong which continued to be produced until the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. These are currently in the process of being replaced with the more efficient AC motors.

A wheel slide protection (WSP) system had to be retrofitted due to the fleet suffering an epidemic problem of wheel flats. This was largely due to an excessive number of emergency brake applications caused during the ATO/ATP testing phases. 

The 1992 stock&#x27;s design is reminiscent of the 1986 prototypes. The 2009 stock trains, built by Bombardier Transport for the Victoria line, are more like the 1992 stock in shape and design than the 1995/1996 stock.

=== Waterloo &amp; City line sets ===

After the initial construction run, an additional ten two-car units were built for British Rail for the Waterloo &amp; City line, which at the time was part of the national railway network. The trains were designated as Class 482 until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to London Underground and the trains were simply referred to as 1992 Stock. The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP.

Transport for London and Metronet closed the Waterloo &amp; City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock. The line&#x27;s limited access meant that this was the first time that the units had been brought above ground since their introduction 12 years earlier. The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the Network SouthEast colours used since the stock&#x27;s introduction.

== Operation ==

The 1992 Stock features both automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train protection (ATP) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a master switch in the driver&#x27;s cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.

In &quot;Automatic&quot; mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press a pair of &quot;Start&quot; buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded. However, it is not communications-based train control found on the other lines.

In &quot;Coded Manual&quot; mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver&#x27;s actions. The speedometer on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops, for example if the target speed is 30 mph and the driver is going at 35 mph the emergency brakes will slow the train down to 29 mph.

In &quot;Restricted Manual&quot; mode, the train cannot exceed and the motors automatically cut out at . The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.

== Announcer system ==
The 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until 2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo.

Since 2003, voice artist Emma Clarke has provided recordings for the 1992 Stock DVA. The new announcer system also includes next station announcements, which the original system did not include. By 2009, the announcements changed to address other lines that are possible to interchange in alphabetical order. Clarke&#x27;s voice lasted until the refurbishment of the rolling stock, when Adrian Hieatt became the voice of the 1992 Stock&#x27;s announcer system.

In January 2018, the announcements were again revised for certain stations, to include new lines and connections (such as London Overground, TfL Rail and the construction of station) that did not exist in 2003.

==Chancery Lane derailment==
On 25 January 2003 a 1992 Stock train with approximately 500 people on board train derailed as it entered Chancery Lane station on the westbound line. The derailment resulted in one door being ripped off and a number of broken windows. 32 passengers received minor injuries.

The cause of the derailment was determined to be the detachment of the rearmost traction motor on the fifth car, caused by a gearbox failure. The traction motor was then struck by the remainder of the train as it passed over it, causing the following bogies to derail.

The entire 1992 Stock fleet was withdrawn from service the same afternoon, and the Central and Waterloo &amp; City lines were closed for several weeks until modifications were made. This included fitting new traction-motor bolts and secondary brackets to prevent a loose motor from striking the track and causing further damage. The lines re-opened in stages from 14 March 2003.

== Refurbishment ==
=== Central line units ===

==== 2011–2012 ====
From 2011 to 2012, the Central line 1992 Stock units underwent a refresh of both the interior and exterior. Some of the noticeable changes included the addition of the new &quot;Barman&quot; seat moquette, new brighter interior lighting and the installation of new window frames. The front of the driving cabs were also refreshed. This included repairing water ingress and replacing a large number of parts with a much simpler design, saving costs on future work and cleaning up the appearance of the front end. The new-style front end can be easily identified by the new red panelling installed on most units instead of the original grey. The refresh came after nearly twenty years of continuous service on the Central line.

==== 2019– ====

Since 2019, TfL is doing a major refurbishment on the Central line units as part of the Central Line Improvement Programme (CLIP). This includes a complete overhaul of the interior and adding new features such as new wheelchair spaces, PIS (Passenger Information Screens), and CCTV installed throughout the train. The London Underground corporate livery will also be repainted on these units as well as the replacement of the original DC motors with new AC motors. It takes approximately 10 weeks to refurbish a train. Work started in 2019 but was heavily delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and financial reasons.

=== Waterloo &amp; City line units ===

In 2006, the Waterloo &amp; City line was closed for several months to allow for track and signalling upgrade works. During this period, the 1992 Stock units in use on the line were removed by crane from Waterloo depot and taken by road to Wabtec Rail in Doncaster for refurbishment. External changes included repainting the trains, which were still in Network SouthEast livery, into London Underground&#x27;s corporate livery. Internally, the handrails were repainted from Central line red to Waterloo &amp; City line turquoise, new seat moquette was fitted and CCTV cameras were installed. Later, the units received the new &quot;Barman&quot; moquette fitted to the Central line units, but not the new lighting, window frames or front end.

== Future replacement ==

In October 2014, it was announced that the 1992 stock would be replaced by a new semi-articulated model referred to as the New Tube for London (NTfL). This has since slipped to 2025. While a cancellation or deferring was never officially announced, it has been implied that the initial order is now only for replacing the 1973 Stock on the Piccadilly line. TfL still has plans on replacing the 1992 Stock on the Central and Waterloo &amp; City lines as well as the 1972 Stock found on the Bakerloo line with NTfL or a future model, but due to a lack of funding, it has been deferred to an unspecified date further in the future. Should a long-term funding deal with the UK Government be made, this may happen sooner. The refurbishment may have delayed said order.

<doc id="1132265" wikidata="Q104840593" url="?curid=1132265" title="Stockade">
<text>A stockade is an enclosure of palisades and tall walls, made of logs placed side by side vertically, with the tops sharpened as a defensive wall.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Stockade&quot; is derived from the French word &quot;estocade&quot;. The French word was derived from the Spanish word &quot;estacada&quot;.

==As a security fence==
The troops or settlers would build a stockade by clearing a space of woodland and using the trees whole or chopped in half, with one end sharpened on each. They would dig a narrow trench around the area, and stand the sharpened logs side-by-side inside it, encircling the perimeter. Sometimes they would add additional defence by placing sharpened sticks in a shallow secondary trench outside the stockade. In colder climates sometimes the stockade received a coating of clay or mud that would make the crude wall wind-proof.

Builders could also place stones or thick mud layers at the foot of the stockade, improving the resistance of the wall. From that the defenders could, if they had the materials, raise a stone or brick wall inside the stockade, creating a more permanent defence while working protected.

==As a military prison==

The word stockade also refers to a military prison in an army camp. In some cases, the term was applied to a crude prison camp or a slave camp. In these cases, the stockade keeps people inside, rather than out.

==As decoration==
Nowadays, stockade walls are often used as garden fencing, made of finished planks more useful for privacy fencing and more decoration than security.

<doc id="1132268" wikidata="Q6670943" url="?curid=1132268" title="London Underground Standard Stock">
<text>The Standard Stock title was applied to a variety of Tube stock built between 1923 and 1934, all of which shared the same basic characteristics, but with some detailed differences. This design is sometimes referred to as 1923 Tube Stock, 1923 Stock, or Pre 1938 Stock. Most of the Standard Stock was built to replace the first generation of &quot;Gate Stock&quot; Tube trains or to provide additional trains for extensions built in the 1920s and early 1930s. Standard Stock cars consisted of motor cars, with a driver&#x27;s cab, behind which was a &quot;switch compartment&quot; occupying approximately one-third of the length of the car, plus trailer cars and &quot;control trailers&quot;, with a driving cab but no motor. All were equipped with air operated sliding doors. The guard&#x27;s door on the earlier trains was a manually operated, inward-opening hinged door.

==1922 Stock prototype cars==

For evaluation purposes, in anticipation of the large number of cars that were to be built over the next several years, six experimental cars were ordered and had been delivered by February 1923. There were five trailers and one control trailer, which were marshalled between French-built &quot;Gate Stock&quot; driving motor cars. A demonstration for the press took place on the Piccadilly line in February 1923, after which the new cars and the French motor cars were moved by road to the Hampstead Line, entering service in August. The French motor cars were part of a batch of 20 which had been rebuilt with air-operated doors, to allow them to work with the 1920 Stock, the first batch of vehicles built with air doors. The trailers and French motor cars formed the inaugural train on the Hampstead Line extension from Golders Green to Hendon when it opened on 19 November 1923.

The builders were given a partial specification, which ensured that each car would have 48 seats and two sets of air-operated double doors on each side, providing an opening which was wide. Beyond these basic guidelines, each builder was allowed to build a trailer car to its own design, although externally, they looked very similar. The control trailer was designed by the Underground Electric Railways.
The stock became known as the 1922 Stock or Competition Stock and was considered part of the Standard stock fleet.

== Production stock ==
The earliest Standard Stock was built for use on the Hampstead tube, which was extended from Golders Green to Edgware and from Clapham Common to Morden in 1923, as well as incorporating the City and South London Railway, which had been rebuilt with larger tunnels. 191 cars were ordered from three manufacturers in 1923, which were formed into five-car trains. The City and South London Railway had been built with tunnels which were only in diameter, and had used small electric locomotives to haul trailer cars, until it closed for rebuilding in 1923. The reconstruction was completed in 1925, and 69 of the new vehicles were owned by them, while the rest were owned by the London Electric Railway Company.

In a departure from previous practice, where all traction control equipment had been supplied by British Thomson-Houston (BTH), most of the batch were fitted with equipment by Metropolitan-Vickers, which consisted of electro-magnetic contactors arranged to manage the acceleration of the train automatically, with switching from series to parallel connection of the motors handled by bridging them rather than open-circuiting them. Two motor cars had equipment by General Electric Co (GEC), which worked similarly, and was required to work in multiple with the Metropolitan-Vickers equipment. All the vehicles used a C-type door operating engine, which proved to be a poor design.

Another 127 cars were ordered in 1924, with most of the motor cars and some of the control trailers using GEC equipment. Cars with GEC controls used WT54 motors. Those with Metropolitan-Vickers equipment used MV152 motors, and although they were interchangeable in theory, in practice they were always kept in pairs. The 1924 cars were fitted with a D-type door engine. This was reclassified as a DL-type after a minor modification had to be made. It proved much more resilient than the earlier C-type, and was used on all Standard Stock until 1931.

Delivery of the cars was not easy, as the Hampstead Line did not have a mainline railway connection to any other line. The bodies and bogies were delivered by road, and two large gantries were erected at both the Morden and Golders Green depots. A traction engine would arrive at the site with the body, and would position it below the gantries. It would then be raised so that the road wheels could be removed, and a steam crane would position the bogies onto the track. Once the body and bogies were united, a steam engine would remove the complete car, to allow the next one to be assembled.

A further 120 cars were ordered in 1925, with both types of equipment, to cope with the opening of the junction at Kennington and the lengthening of trains to six cars and from 1926, seven cars. Motor cars seated 30 passengers, while trailers had 48 seats. Control trailers had a cab at one end, but no switch compartment, and so seated 44. Trains initially had a crew of three, consisting of a motorman, a front conductor, and a rear guard. The guard signalled the conductor that the train was ready to go, and the conductor signalled the motorman.

Once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two. Changes included the fitting of a telephone, so that the guard and motorman could communicate, interlocks to ensure that all doors were closed, and the re-routing of the starting bell, so that it could be operated by a guard at the rear of the train, rather than the conductor at the front. These changes were completed by 1927, allowing the reduction of the train crew.

=== 1926 and 1927 builds ===
The superior nature of the new trains helped to show up the inadequacies of plans to convert large numbers of gate stock cars to have air doors, and they were largely abandoned. Another 112 cars, all fitted with GEC equipment, were ordered from Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance in 1926. An order for 170 cars followed on in 1927. This enabled trains to be increased to seven cars, and more trains to be operated. A second order was placed with MCWF in 1927, for 136 more cars.

The traction control equipment was supplied by British Thomson-Houston. Their equipment generally proved to be more reliable, and previous batches of Standard Stock were modified so that the main contactors could be replaced with BTH equipment. BTH continued to be the preferred supplier for this equipment for the next 35 years. Metropolitan-Vickers supplied their own motors. Standard Stock built by other manufacturers used GEC motors. The inter-operability of cars from several manufacturers with three types of traction control was the reason that they were called Standard Stock.

The 1927 builds used a &#x27;Z&#x27; bogie, instead of the previous &#x27;Y&#x27; bogie, which had wheels of diameter, as opposed to . This required a modification to the WT54 motors, supplied by GEC, which were then known as WT54A motors. The gearing was altered so that cars with either size of wheels remained compatible. Trials with the &#x27;loudaphone&#x27; system by which the guard and motorman could communicate on this stock resulted in it being retro-fitted to the earlier stock.

During this period, many of the Gate Stock cars on the Central line had been converted to air-door operation by the Union Construction Co., which was based at Feltham. Plans were briefly formulated to convert the Gate Stock on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines, but analysis showed that the cost of building a new car was only slightly more than the cost of converting an old one, and so an order for 182 new cars was placed. They were known as the 1927 Feltham Stock. Their door plates carried the date 1928, and they were not delivered until 1929 and 1930. The lightweight construction caused problems in later years, when the seat risers and body bolsters developed fractures. With the batch of cars built by MCWF and fitted with BTH equipment, these vehicles enabled Gate Stock to be withdrawn from the Piccadilly line in June 1929, and from the Bakerloo line on 1 January 1930.

=== 1929 and 1930 builds ===
Another 53 cars were ordered from the Union Construction Co. in 1929, to enable the remaining 1920 Stock cars, which had air doors but were not really suitable for operation on the open sections of the Piccadilly line, to be transferred to the Bakerloo line. An extra train of two motor cars and four trailers was ordered in 1930, to test several new features. They were the last cars to be built by the Union Construction Co., for it was closed as a result of political pressure in 1932. The new motor cars were longer, and the trailers were longer. This was achieved by tapering one or both ends, to prevent them fouling the structure gauge on curves. On two of the trailers, the centre door openings were widened from to . On the other two, the width of the centre doors was not altered, but the seating capacity was reduced from 48 to 40, to allow the provision of an additional single-leaf door at both ends of the car. The position of the guard&#x27;s door control panel was altered, although this was not found to be satisfactory, and was dropped from subsequent builds.

Because of the Piccadilly extensions, which were above ground, heaters were fitted, and the use of British materials in its construction was used for publicity purposes, at a time when there was an industrial depression. It became known as the &#x27;All British&#x27; train, and operated on the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Transfer between the two was aided by the construction of a junction at Kings Cross in 1927. The Northern line offered heavier traffic, with which to assess the effectiveness of the new features. 62 production cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, which was formed from the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Co. and Cammell Laird at this time, for delivery to the Bakerloo line. They replaced the Watford Joint Stock, which although relatively new, needed a larger crew and had to stop for longer at stations, because of its swing doors. Problems with the swing doors were highlighted by a fatal accident in which a passenger got caught in them, but the door interlock did not detect it.

This build was not initially compatible with other builds, because it was fitted with an electro-pneumatic braking system, as well as the Westinghouse air brake. To accommodate its control, an extra 10-core control jumper was fitted. Previous builds of Standard Stock were gradually altered to include the extra wires, a process which was largely completed by 1936. Standard Stock motor cars which were running on the Bakerloo line with Cammell Laird 1920 Stock trailers were not fitted with the electro-pneumatic brake wiring until the trailers were withdrawn in 1938.

=== 1931 and 1934 builds ===
In 1929, government aid enabled plans for extensions to the Piccadilly line northwards to Cockfosters and westwards from Hammersmith to Acton Town, on tracks which were parallel to the District line but not shared with it, to come to fruition. The length of the line increased from to , and so more trains were needed. The improvements made for the 1930 build were incorporated into the design, as well as some new features. 145 motor cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, and 130 trailer cars were shared between two builders. All trailer cars had 12 doors, with two sets of double doors and a single-leaf door at both ends on each side. Electro-pneumatic brakes were fitted, as was a weak-field control, which enabled higher speed running and had been tested on the 1930 build. Its use on the Northern line had demonstrated that the same service intervals could be maintained with four fewer trains.

The final build of Standard Stock was a small batch of 26 motor cars ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell in 1934, after the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board in the previous year. The Piccadilly line was extended from South Harrow to Uxbridge, and this required an extra eight seven-car trains. These were made up from the new motor cars and some reshuffling of stock between other lines. Although very similar to the 1931 build, there were some minor differences. The 1931 build had used motors with roller bearings for the first time, and ten of the new motor cars were also fitted with roller bearing axle boxes, to reduce the amount of maintenance required with white metal bearings. With the completion of the 1934 build, the total number of Standard Stock cars was 645 motor cars, 551 trailers and 270 control trailers.

== Allocation ==
By the time the final cars had been delivered, the standard stock was operating on the Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. There were 724 cars on the Northern line, consisting of 336 motor cars, 243 trailers and 145 control trailers. This group comprised all of the cars made in 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926, supplemented by 62 per cent of the 1927 build by Metropolitan, and 13 of the 1927-built Feltham cars. The Piccadilly line had 509 cars, comprising some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, most of the 1929 Feltham stock, the experimental 1930 Feltham train, and all of the 1931 and 1934 stock. The Bakerloo line also had some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, four cars from the 1929 Feltham build and the 1930 Metropolitan stock. This was a total of 198 cars, made up of 82 motor cars, 62 trailers and 54 control trailers. To make up the number of trains, an additional 20 trailers and 20 control trailers were needed, and these were cars of 1920 Cammell Laird air-door stock.

Between 1935 and 1940, the London Underground benefited from a New Works Programme worth £40 million. This included extensions to the Northern line and the Central line, with delivery of new trains of 1938 Stock beginning in May 1938. The intention was to run the new trains on the Northern line, and transfer the displaced Standard Stock to the Central line, which was using stock built in 1900–1903. In addition, some of the displaced stock would be used on the Moorgate-Finsbury Park &quot;Highbury Branch&quot;, also known as the Northern City Line, and some would be used to increase the length of trains on the Bakerloo line to seven cars. 82 control trailers were converted to trailers, and 21 driving motor cars were altered from &quot;A&quot; cars to &quot;D&quot; cars, as the makeup of 7 car trains on the Bakerloo and Central lines had the three-car unit at the opposite end to those on the Northern line.

The Northern City Line had previously been served by surface stock, and had to be modified to accommodate the Standard Stock. Additionally, it had a non-standard arrangement of the third and fourth rails which supplied power to the cars, and these were modified to the same configuration as on the Northern line during the refurbishment. The use of control trailers at one end of a short train was virtually discontinued during the 1930s, because of the risks of disruption to services. A 3-car train consisted on a driving motor car, a trailer and a control trailer (DM-T-CT) and only had one compressor on the motor car. If it failed, the train was stranded, causing delays, whereas a 4-car short train had two motor cars (DM-T-T-DM) and hence two compressors. Failure of one did not prevent the train continuing. The exception to the use of control trailers was the off-peak trains on the Northern City Line, which consisted of a driving motor car and a control trailer, and these 2-car trains continued to run until October 1964.

===Central line===
On the Central line, Standard Stock began replacing the 1900/1903 Stock in the autumn of 1938, and this action was completed by mid-1939. The Central line used a three-rail system, with a central conductor rail supplying the power, and was not converted to a four-rail system until May 1940. All of the trains were therefore converted to work with the three-rail system as an interim measure, and then converted back to four-rail operation once the track had been modified.

At the time, extensions to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault were under construction, which would require more trains, but the onset of the Second World War resulted in the extensions being postponed. Nearly 200 cars were stored in the partially built Hainault depot, but that was then requisitioned by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, and the cars were moved to open sidings. Others were stored on sidings at Edgware, Golders Green, Highgate, Morden, Neasden, and Stanmore, as well as in depots where there was spare capacity. Some of the motor cars were painted grey, and used for engineering duties. Some trains were used for &quot;Tube Refreshment Specials&quot;, supplying food and drink to people sheltering from air raids on the underground platforms.

After the war ended, the Central line extensions opened, reaching Stratford in December 1946, Newbury Park and Woodford in December 1947, West Ruislip, Loughton and Hainault in November 1948, and Epping in September 1949. The effects of six or more years of open-air storage on the Standard Stock was severe, and a programme of heavy refurbishment began, which included replacement of warped window frames, renewal of corroded equipment as necessary, and in many cases, complete rewiring. Stations had been lengthened to accommodate 8-car trains before the war, but trains were restricted to 6 cars until the depot at White City could be altered. Some 7-car trains began operating from November 1947, and 8-car trains from the following January. The reliability of the refurbished cars was poor, and a full service of 8-car trains was not achieved until additional cars became available from other lines, following the delivery of the 1959 Stock. The achievement was short-lived, as all Standard Stock had been withdrawn from the Central line less than three years later.

8-car trains were formed of two 4-car units, each consisting of two driving motor cars and two trailers (DM-T-T-DM). This arrangement was not ideal at busy times, since there was a section in the middle of the train where there were no passenger doors for almost , caused by the switch compartments behind the driving cabs. In order to alleviate the problem, one of the four-car units was split, and two cars were placed at either end of the other unit. The formation from 1961 thus became DM-T x DM-T-T-DM x T-DM, which reduced loading times at peak periods.

== Withdrawal ==
1938 Stock replaced the Standard Stock on the Bakerloo line, the changeover being completed in May 1949. A batch of 1927-built trailers, usually referred to as &quot;58 trailers&quot; because of the number of cars in the group rather than a year reference, as was normally the case with Tube stock classes, were converted to operate with the new stock on the Bakerloo line. The Standard Stock on the Piccadilly line was eventually replaced by the 1959 Stock. This enabled the first large-scale withdrawals and scrapping of Standard Stock, although some of the better cars were transferred to the Central line to complete the 8-car trains.

London Transport intended to use the prototype 1960 Stock to develop new trains to replace the Standard Stock on the Central line: however, the condition of the 30–40 year-old Central line fleet were deteriorating under an intense service pattern, exacerbated by growing demand from the expansion of electric trains in the Eastern Region of British Railways. The situation escalated with a fatal electrical fire on car 3465 near Holland Park in 1958, and another (non-fatal) fire on car 3673 near Redbridge in 1960.

In response to the fires, London Transport diverted 57 of the 76 trains from the 1959 Stock to debut on the Central line instead of the Piccadilly line, and ordered another 57 non-driving motor cars that would later form part of the near-identical 1962 Stock. London Transport retained some Standard Stock cars from the Piccadilly line to replace the worst performing cars on the Central line.

London Transport withdrew the last Standard Stock trains from the Central line in June 1963. The arrival of the 1962 stock in the previous year then allowed the 1959 stock to complete the withdrawal of the Standard Stock from the Piccadilly line by July 1964. This allowed the 1938 Stock to replace the last Standard Stock trains from the Northern City Line, in November 1966.

A number of motor cars saw further service as departmental vehicles. 16 were used as ballast motor cars, with many of them lasting until 1978, and four were used as pilot motor cars. Motor car 3327 was displayed in the Science Museum, London, for many years, but returned to the London Transport Museum in 1996.

== Isle of Wight ==

Prior to 1950, there were of steam-operated railways on the Isle of Wight. This was reduced to between 1952 and 1956, and to just in 1966. The Ryde Pier Head–Shanklin section (the Island Line) was retained and electrified, but because of the restricted loading gauge at Ryde Tunnels, smaller-than-normal trains were required.

The Southern Region approached London Transport in 1961, to begin negotiations for some of the Standard Stock then being withdrawn. The initial plan was to fit diesel engines into the motor cars, and to use either electric or mechanical transmission. The first twelve cars were transferred from Ruislip Depot to Wimbledon in August 1964, from where they were moved to Micheldever sidings. Further cars followed in June 1965. In October, a plan to electrify the line was announced, and the idea of fitting diesel engines was dropped. In 1966, the Southern Region had 44 cars at Micheldever, and London Transport had 29 more which were set aside for the scheme. 10 of the Micheldever cars were scrapped, and 12 more were obtained from London Transport.

Overhaul of the electrical and braking systems was done at Acton Works, which involved transferring the cars from Micheldever back to London Transport. This included conversion to work with a three-rail system, rather than the standard London Transport four-rail system. The number of cars to be shipped to the Isle of Wight was reduced from 46 to 43 because of the cost of this work. After overhaul, the cars were transferred to Stewarts Lane, where they were repainted in British Rail blue, and were then taken to the Isle of Wight. They were loaded onto a road vehicle at Fratton belonging to the haulage company Pickfords, and crossed to the island on the Portsmouth to Fishbourne ferry. Care was needed to ensure that the weather and tides were suitable, and motor cars had to be transferred on special sailings, rather than regular crossings, because of the difficulty of unloading a vehicle of this weight without damaging the ship&#x27;s unloading ramp.

The cars were formed into 4-car and 3-car units, initially designated as 4-VEC and 3-TIS units. They became Classes 452 and 451. They were later reclassified to become Classes 485 and 486. Apart from those cut up following accidents at Ryde depot, and other early withdrawals, most of these units were withdrawn between 1988 and 1991, when they were replaced by London Underground 1938 Stock. In October 1990, five cars were returned to London Transport, to form a Heritage Train. They worked under their own power between Fratton and Wimbledon, and were displayed at an open day at Morden Depot, celebrating 100 years of the Northern line.

== Manufacturers ==
Standard Stock is used to describe six experimental cars built by five manufacturers in 1923, and 18 batches of production cars, totalling 1460 vehicles, built by six manufacturers between 1923 and 1934. It became the most prolific class of stock to run on the Underground, which was partly due to the Trade Facilities Act 1921. This was a government initiative in the aftermath of the First World War to fund schemes which would create employment, particularly in the construction, steel and manufacturing industries. The Underground benefited from £5 million of investment from this source, which in addition to funding extensions to the Northern line, financed the construction of over 1,100 Standard Stock cars between 1922 and 1930.

== Preservation ==
Several vehicles have been preserved: 


Key to Type



The London Transport shunting locomotive L11 was converted from two Standard Stock cars in 1964. It underwent restoration in 2014 and is on static display at Epping Tube Station, repainted from London Underground red into engineer&#x27;s yellow.

Four cars owned by the London Transport Museum have been formed into a four-car unit, consisting of DM 3370, DM 3693, CT 5279 and T 7296 at their Acton Depot. They are awaiting restoration. 2 cars - Trailer car 5279 and Control Trailer 7296 - were both in operations on the Isle of Wight as British Rail Class 485s.

Several cars that were preserved have since been scrapped.
* DM 3209 / 7 scrapped at Acton Works 2013.
* DM 3690 / L130 scrapped at Acton Works 2013.
* DM 3701 / L135 scrapped at Acton Works 2013.
* DM 3706 / 2 scrapped at Acton Works 2013.
* T 7061 / PC850 scrapped at Acton Works 2013.
* T 7063 / PC851 scrapped at Acton Works 2006.
* T 7071 / PC855 scrapped at Acton Works 2006.
* T 7281 / 44 scrapped at Acton Works 2013.
These vehicles were all stored in Acton Works up until the works claimed that they needed the space in which the trains were stored and without a place to be moved to and with them all being in deteriorating, poor condition, all the cars were scrapped.

<doc id="1132274" wikidata="Q6872694" url="?curid=1132274" title="Miramar Air Show">
<text>The Miramar Air Show is an annual air show in San Diego, California, held at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. The three-day event is the largest military air show in the United States, with total annual attendance estimated at 700,000. In 2007, it was voted the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Military Air Show&quot; by the International Council of Air Shows, the first time the award was given to a Marine Corps air station since 1994.

The show&#x27;s daily performance schedule includes military and civilian aircraft, usually highlighted by the Blue Angels, and is largely the same for all three days, with an extra &quot;twilight show&quot; on Saturday night only. Mornings are largely taken up by civilian performers. The Saturday twilight show includes military and civilian performers, a fireworks display, and the detonation of the &quot;Great Wall of Fire&quot; pyrotechnic display.

The show includes a large selection of &quot;static&quot; (non-flying) displays representing aircraft from the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and the United States Marine Corps, as well as civilian and historic military aircraft. Numerous commercial vendors, United States Armed Forces recruiting displays, area law enforcement recruiters, civilian flight organizations and a business and franchise fair are also on site.

== Static Displays ==

The show features more than 100 military and civilian aircraft on static display. The particular aircraft on hand changes each year depending on availability. Most aircraft can be toured by visitors, with active-duty service personnel on hand to answer questions. The displays are informally grouped into areas representing:
* USAF transport planes and bombers such as the C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III, KC-135 Stratotanker, C-130 Hercules and B-52 Stratofortress, as well as fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-15 Eagle and F-22 Raptor, and other support and training aircraft;
* &quot;Squadron Row,&quot; an area of booths staffed by units based at Miramar and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, as well as other Marine Corps bases, to meet the public and sell merchandise to support squadron activities, and to display squadron aircraft including fixed-wing (F/A-18 Hornet and AV-8B Harrier) and rotor wing (AH-1 Cobra, MV-22 Osprey, and CH-53 Sea Stallion) aircraft;
* The MAGTF area with rotor wing and tiltrotor aircraft representing units based at Miramar and nearby Camp Pendleton, and infantry units from Pendleton and other installations demonstrating M1 Abrams tanks, LAV-25 Light Armored Vehicles, support vehicles, artillery systems and infantry weapons;
* A &quot;War Birds&quot; area representing World War II-era aircraft, aircraft from the Korean War and Vietnam War era, and aircraft from foreign countries;
* Recruiting and informational displays by most branches of the U.S. armed forces, area law enforcement agencies, the Border Patrol, the Civil Air Patrol, and other civilian organizations.

== Aerial Performers ==

Most years the performance schedule is highlighted by the Blue Angels, who perform each day of the show. In 2007 the USAF Thunderbirds performed at the show (the two teams very rarely perform together ). These performances mark the end of each day&#x27;s aerial performance schedule, except for the Saturday twilight show.

Separately, the Navy&#x27;s F/A-18E Super Hornet and USMC AV-8B Harrier usually fly individual demonstrations. The MV-22 Osprey has also been featured since the 2011 show. In 2014, the Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II flew for the first time at the show.

Though focused on Marine Corps and Navy assets, the show also regularly includes USAF aircraft, including the F-22 Raptor and other fighter aircraft when available.

The U.S. Army Golden Knights Parachute Team frequently performs, and often jumps during the twilight show. Since 1999, the show has often featured a Navy Legacy Flight, where modern jets fly in formation with aircraft from previous eras in celebration of military veterans and naval aviation history.

The show also attracts a number of civilian performers from the U.S. air show circuit, flying prop planes, jet aircraft and gliders. Frequent performers include Sean Tucker&#x27;s Oracle Challenger, the Red Bull Helicopter (a modified Messerschmitt-Bölkow Blohm BO-105 capable of aerobatic maneuvers), and the Shockwave jet truck, which also perform during the twilight show. There is also a selection of radio-controlled planes.

== MAGTF Demo ==

A major element of each year&#x27;s show is the MAGTF Demo, a simulated assault by numerous Marine Corps units that demonstrates the air, ground and logistical elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force. The demonstration is performed each day of the show and features an array of fixed-wing, helicopter and tilt-rotor aircraft—F/A-18 Hornet and AV-8B Harrier jets, CH-53E Super Stallion, AH-1 Cobra and UH-1Y Venom helicopters, the MV-22 Osprey, and KC-130 Hercules tankers—all in the air simultaneously. The Hornet and Harrier jets take turns flying simulated attack runs and demonstrate mid-air refueling with the KC-130. The MV-22 Ospreys also demonstrate refueling, then deliver Marine Corps ground troops to the airfield, while the Cobra gunships simulate attack and air cover roles. (The MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft joined the MAGTF demo in 2010 and replaced the CH-46 Sea Knight entirely in 2014 as the aircraft was phased out of the Marine Corps inventory.) The UH-1 delivers a team of Marine infantry via a fast-rope insertion, where they simulate calling in a naval artillery barrage, then retrieves them in a Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction maneuver. On the ground, Marine infantry simulate an advance on an enemy position, joined by M-1 Abrams tanks, Light Armored Vehicles and Humvees. Throughout the demonstration the attacks are punctuated by controlled pyrotechnic explosions, culminating in a &quot;wall of fire&quot; detonation. An air and ground review concludes each performance.

== History ==
Prior to 1998, the Miramar installation was operated by the U.S. Navy as Naval Air Station Miramar, and the Navy produced the Miramar Air Show. The Marine Corps aircraft squadrons based in the region at that time, and since shortly after WWII, were located at Marine Corps Air Station Tustin and Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Orange County, where the Marines had produced their own annual air show since 1950. 

In 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission announced that MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin would be closed and the Miramar facility transferred to the Marine Corps. The final Marine Corps air show at El Toro was held in 1997, drawing two million visitors; the final Navy-produced Miramar Air Show was held later the same year. In 1998, the Marine Corps took over production of the show at Miramar. 

The 2011 show was the 56th edition of the event, and celebrated the 100th anniversary of naval aviation. 

The 2013 edition of the show was cancelled the day before it was scheduled to begin as a result of federal budget battles. The full three-day show resumed in 2014. 

The 2020 and 2021 Air Shows were canceled due to public health concerns associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.

<doc id="1132278" wikidata="Q202671" url="?curid=1132278" title="Beagle Channel">
<text>Beagle Channel (; Yahgan: &quot;Onašaga&quot;) is a strait in the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago, on the extreme southern tip of South America between Chile and Argentina. The channel separates the larger main island of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from various smaller islands including the islands of Picton, Lennox and Nueva; Navarino; Hoste; Londonderry; and Stewart. The channel&#x27;s eastern area forms part of the border between Chile and Argentina and the western area is entirely within Chile.

The Beagle Channel, the Straits of Magellan to the north, and the open-ocean Drake Passage to the south are the three navigable passages around South America between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Most commercial shipping uses the open-ocean Drake Passage.

The Beagle Channel is about long and wide at its narrowest point. It extends from Nueva Island in the east to Darwin Sound and Cook Bay in the Pacific Ocean in the west. Some from its western end, it divides into two branches, north and south of Gordon Island. The southwest branch between Hoste Island and Gordon Island enters Cook Bay. The northwest branch between Gordon Island and Isla Grande enters Darwin Sound, which connects to the Pacific Ocean by the O&#x27;Brien and Ballenero channels. The biggest settlement on the channel is Ushuaia in Argentina followed by Puerto Williams in Chile. These are amongst the southernmost settlements in the world.

==Navigation==
Although it is navigable by large ships, there are safer waters to the south (Drake Passage) and to the north (Strait of Magellan). Under the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina, ships of other nations navigate with a Chilean pilot between the Strait of Magellan and Ushuaia through the Magdalena Channel and the Cockburn Channel to the Pacific Ocean, then by the Ballenero Channel, the O&#x27;Brien Channel and the northwest branch of the Beagle Channel.

==Islands==
The Beagle Channel is between islands covering a much larger area; to the north lies Argentine-Chilean Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, to the south Hoste, Navarino, and Picton and Nueva, which were claimed by Argentina until 1984. The latter two lie at the bi-national eastern entrance to the channel while the western entrance is wholly inside Chile. The western entrance of Beagle Channel is divided by Gordon Island into two channels. Some minor islands exist inside the channel among them Snipe Islet and Gable Island. Except for eastern Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and Gable Island all islands mentioned here belong to Chile.

==History==
The Yaghan peoples settled the islands along the Murray Channel approximately 10,000 years before present. There are notable archaeological sites indicating such early Yaghan settlement at locations such as Bahia Wulaia on Isla Navarino, site of the &quot;Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens&quot;.

===Mythology===
According to a Selk&#x27;nam myth the channel was created alongside the Strait of Magellan and Fagnano Lake in places where slingshots fell on earth during Taiyín&#x27;s fight with a witch who was said to have &quot;retained the waters and the foods&quot;.

===Naming and Darwin visit===
The channel was named after the ship HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; during its first hydrographic survey of the coasts of the southern part of South America which lasted from 1826 to 1830. During that expedition, under the overall command of Commander Phillip Parker King, the &quot;Beagle&quot; captain Pringle Stokes committed suicide and was replaced by captain Robert FitzRoy. The ship continued the survey in the second voyage of &quot;Beagle&quot; under the command of captain FitzRoy, who took Charles Darwin along as a self-funding , giving him opportunities as an amateur naturalist. Darwin had his first sight of glaciers when they reached the channel on 29 January 1833, and wrote in his field notebook &quot;It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers, and especially as contrasted with the dead white of the upper expanse of snow.&quot;

===Beagle conflict===
Several small islands (Picton, Lennox and Nueva) up to the Cape Horn were the subject of the long-running Beagle conflict between Chile and Argentina; by the terms of a Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina they are now part of Chile. From the 1950s to 1970s several incidents involving the Chilean and Argentine navies occurred in the waters of the Beagle Channel, for example the 1958 Snipe incident, the 1967 &quot;Cruz del Sur&quot; incident and the shelling of &quot;Quidora&quot; the same year. See List of incidents during the Beagle conflict.

=== Beagle Channel in the Fine Arts ===
As a ship&#x27;s painter, Conrad Martens drew and created watercolour paintings in 1833 and 1834 during the second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; in Tierra del Fuego.

The German painter Ingo Kühl traveled three times to the Beagle Channel, where he created paintings on board a sailing yacht.

<text>SportsCentre (SC) is a Canadian daily sports news television program sports news television program, and the flagship program on TSN. The program airs several times daily TSN feeds, and on weekends on CTV.

== History ==
The program was launched under its original title SportsDesk the same day as TSN itself debuted, on September 1, 1984. It retained that title until September 5, 2001, when the program was relaunched under a similar look and format to American cable network ESPN&#x27;s flagship sportscast &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, with the title rendered in Canadian spelling. It also uses the current ESPN &quot;SportsCenter&quot; theme. The change in name occurred after majority ownership in TSN had been turned over to CTV the previous year when it acquired 80% of the network; the transaction required the approval of existing minority shareholder ESPN, which did so on the condition that TSN align its branding and programming more closely with ESPN&#x27;s, and with it, also introducing a new logo that was akin to that of ESPN&#x27;s. Since relaunching as &quot;SportsCentre&quot;, the program has normally originated from the CTV (now Bell Media) Agincourt studios at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario.

On September 25, 2006, &quot;SportsCentre&quot; began broadcasting in high definition. At that time, TSN expressed hopes to have all reports from its bureaus in HD in the near future.

In the early 2010s, the program drew significant attention, including from media in the United States, for its 1 a.m. ET/morning-loop anchor team of Jay Onrait and Dan O&#x27;Toole, which had taken the program in a much more irreverent and comedic direction. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published a feature story on the pair titled &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Have Canada&#x27;s &#x27;SportsCentre&#x27;?&quot;, which compared the Onrait-O&#x27;Toole pairing to the likes of 1990s ESPN &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors Keith Olbermann and Craig Kilborn.

The attention eventually led to Onrait, O&#x27;Toole, and their longtime producer Tim Moriarty all being hired by Fox Sports in the U.S. to help launch its new national cable channel Fox Sports 1 in 2013. Onrait and O&#x27;Toole served as hosts of &quot;Fox Sports Live&quot;, which was initially a competitor to the U.S. version of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPN (and later relaunched as a sports-oriented talk show), until February 2017 when Fox cancelled the show and allowed their contracts to expire. Jay and Dan were later rehired by TSN becoming the anchors of a new rebranded midnight ET edition of &quot;SportsCentre&quot;, &quot;SC with Jay and Dan&quot;.

=== Kraft Celebration Tour ===
From 2009 to 2014, for ten days in late August and/or early September of each year, &quot;SportsCentre&quot; travelled to ten communities across Canada under the banner of the &quot;Kraft Celebration Tour&quot;. Two teams of anchors, one starting in the East and the other in the West, broadcast on alternating days during the tour. Each of the ten host communities received a minimum C$25,000 grant from Kraft Foods to support a community project related to sports or active living.

Host communities were nominated by local residents and submissions are reviewed by a TSN/Kraft judging panel. From 2009 to 2013, the panel named the top 20 finalists each year (10 pairs of two) which were reduced to the ten hosts via online voting. In 2014, the judging panel named all ten hosts directly, with the public instead voting on the winner of a new $100,000 grand prize, and the nine other communities winning $25,000 as before. While the main judging criteria were related to the value of the proposed project and overall submission quality, production logistics and &quot;the need to create a viable cross-Canada tour&quot; were also considerations. The majority of provinces were represented each year, though some provinces sometimes had multiple hosts per year, meaning that smaller provinces (most frequently one or more in Atlantic Canada) were skipped in some years. No community in the territories was selected prior to 2013, when Fort Smith, Northwest Territories was selected in online voting over Whitehorse, Yukon.

In 2015, the Kraft Celebration Tour was replaced with a new initiative, Kraft Project Play, which involves increased funding for community projects, but no longer includes live on-location broadcasts of &quot;SportsCentre&quot;.

===2020 coronavirus pandemic reaction===

On March 11, 2020, the NBA announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely following the conclusion of that night&#x27;s games as a result of Rudy Gobert testing positive for COVID-19 before a game between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder in Oklahoma City, which caused the game to be initially postponed. The following day, all of the other major sports leagues followed suit in suspending their seasons for an indefinite period in order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and other sporting events were also canceled after plans to hold them without an audience fell through. After the cancellations were announced, TSN aired special editions of the program chronicling the effects of the pandemic and its impact on sporting events and the athletes&#x27; reactions to the pandemic via social media.

Following a hiatus of original broadcasts, production of &quot;SportsCentre&quot; and &quot;SC with Jay and Dan&quot; resumed on April 6, 2020, with anchors and editorial staff working from their homes. Studio production of &quot;SportsCentre&quot; resumed in mid-June 2020. Airings of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and &quot;Get Up!&quot; were also added to the TSN schedule to provide supplemental news content.

== Scheduling ==
TSN generally produces three editions of &quot;SportsCentre&quot; each day, all of which are usually at least one hour in length: early evening (6:00 p.m. ET), late evening in the East (typically 10:00 p.m. ET), and late evening in the West (1:00 a.m. ET). The latter broadcast is repeated on an hourly loop throughout the overnight and morning hours, typically running until 1:00 p.m. ET. Since the launch of TSN2 in 2008, some editions (and repeats) have occasionally aired on that channel in the event of programming conflicts on TSN. TSN has gradually increased the length and, in some cases, repetition of &quot;SportsCentre&quot; broadcasts such that the program is now sometimes carried for up to 16.5 hours out of the day (including &quot;morning loop&quot; repeats) on either TSN or TSN2 (this is similar to the expansion of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; broadcasts on ESPN since 2008, although with fewer live telecasts).

For a time, TSN2 also carried an abbreviated highlights-only broadcast called &quot;SportsCentre Morning Rush&quot;, which aired on a 15-minute loop during the morning hours. This program has since been replaced with TSN Radio simulcasts and repeats of other TSN-produced programs such as &quot;That&#x27;s Hockey 2Nite&quot;.

Beginning with the 2007 NFL season, extra editions have been produced for sister network CTV as its post-game program for early-window Sunday afternoon NFL games. On weekends, CTV also airs repeats of the previous night&#x27;s late edition of &quot;SportsCentre&quot; at noon local time.

On September 4, 2017, a new midnight ET edition, &quot;SC with Jay and Dan&quot; was introduced, which was hosted by Jay Onrait and Dan O&#x27;Toole as a distinct version of their previous tenure as late-night anchors of the program prior to their move to Fox Sports 1. On February 2, 2021, Bell Media (TSN&#x27;s majority owner) released O&#x27;Toole from the program, re-naming it &quot;SC with Jay Onrait&quot;.

== Format ==
For a 60-minute broadcast, the first half-hour typically contains highlights for the day&#x27;s biggest events, sometimes with a weekly feature (such as &quot;Plays of the Week&quot; or &quot;Ultimate SC&quot;) towards the end of that half-hour. The first segment of the second half-hour typically returns to the top two or three stories with packaged reports and/or panel analysis, which is followed by additional highlights and other features. Some highlights segments are given individual names at their conclusion (for example, &quot;NHL Wrap-Up&quot; or &quot;Golf Report&quot;) for the apparent sole purpose of providing sponsorship opportunities related to those sports and are otherwise indistinguishable from the rest of the show.

The second-to-last segment traditionally contains two daily features: the &quot;Honour Roll&quot;, which is a collection of the best plays of the day in no particular order, and (on weeknights) the &quot;&quot;SportsCentre&quot; Top 10&quot;, a countdown of past sports highlights with some theme, typically related to a recent sports event (typical topics might include: &quot;Game 6 Performances Forcing a Game 7&quot;, &quot;Odd Celebrity Moments&quot;, or &quot;Objects Thrown by Spectators&quot;; the Friday night/Saturday morning topic is almost always &quot;Top 10 Must-See Moments&quot; of the past week). This differs from ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; Top 10, which is usually just the top 10 plays of the day. The final segment includes the &quot;Worst Play of the Day&quot; and the &quot;Highlight of the Night&quot;, the latter chosen from the Honour Roll highlights.

In 2014, an online-poll feature titled &quot;1v1&quot;, sponsored by Ram Trucks, was added to the closing segment of &quot;SportsCentre&quot; five nights per week (Sunday night/Monday morning through Thursday/Friday). Each day&#x27;s poll pairs a reigning &quot;champion&quot; highlight (with a ten-day maximum) with a &quot;challenger&quot; (usually that edition&#x27;s Highlight of the Night). This caused the Highlight of the Night announcement to be moved to the second-last segment right after the Top 10, and later the Honour Roll to be moved to the third-last segment. The traditional format is still used Friday and Saturday nights (Saturday and Sunday mornings).

The early-evening (6:00 p.m. ET) edition varies from the above format slightly as it mostly previews the night&#x27;s games and covers other off-field sports news, along with any daytime highlights. The second half-hour is largely a repeat of the first, with the exception of some features such as the extra segment of &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; produced for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; in the first half, and the &quot;Honour Roll Encore&quot; (a repeat of the previous night&#x27;s set of top highlights) at the end of the broadcast.

<text>Baeocystin, also known as norpsilocybin or 4-phosphoryloxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamine (4-PO-NMT), is a zwitterionic alkaloid and analogue of psilocybin. It is found as a minor compound in most psilocybin mushrooms together with psilocybin, norbaeocystin, aeruginascin, and psilocin. Baeocystin is the &quot;N&quot;-demethylated derivative of psilocybin and the 4-phosphorylated derivative of 4-HO-NMT (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamine). The structures at right illustrate baeocystin in its zwitterionic form.

==History==
Baeocystin was first isolated from the mushroom &quot;Psilocybe baeocystis&quot;, and later from &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;, &quot;Panaeolus renenosus&quot;, &quot;Panaeolus subbalteatus&quot;, and &quot;Copelandia chlorocystis&quot;. It was first synthesized by Troxler &quot;et al&quot;. in 1959.

==Pharmacology==
Baeocystin is thought to be a prodrug of norpsilocin, analogously to how psilocybin is a prodrug of psilocin. Norpsilocin is a potent and centrally penetrant agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and also interacts with other serotonin receptors.

Baeocystin and norpsilocin have been found to be inactive in terms of hallucinogen-like effects in rodents in multiple studies published in the 2020s. More specifically, they were unable to produce the head-twitch response (HTR), a well-established behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, and this was in contrast to psilocybin. In one of the papers, the researchers concluded that &quot;...baeocystin alone would likely not induce hallucinogenic effects &quot;in vivo&quot;&quot;. As with baeocystin and norpsilocin, norbaeocystin, aeruginascin, 4-hydroxytryptamine (4-HT), and 4-HO-TMT also all failed to induce the HTR in rodents. However, these compounds have not necessarily been inactive in terms of behavioral effects in general.

Chemist and mycologist Jochen Gartz reported in the 1990s that baeocystin is active as a psychedelic in humans. He has stated that 4mg produced a &quot;threshold&quot; or &quot;gentle hallucinogenic experience&quot; with &quot;mild hallucinations for three hours&quot; and that &quot;10mg of baeocystin [was] found to be about as psychoactive as a similar amount of psilocybin&quot;. Gartz also personally communicated these findings to Jonathan Ott, who has reproduced the claims. Hamilton Morris has expressed surprise and skepticism about the reported psychoactivity of baeocystin however.

Gartz has also claimed that mushrooms with high baeocystin content, such as &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot;, are more frequently associated with dysphoric experiences. Conversely, he has claimed that accidental ingestion of &quot;Inocybe aeruginascens&quot;, which contains high levels of both aeruginascin and baeocystin, is usually associated with euphoric experiences, in contrast to the dysphoric experiences that can occur with mushrooms containing only high levels of psilocybin. However, more research is needed on the effects of baeocystin and aeruginascin in humans.

In contrast to Gartz, mycologist Paul Stamets has reported that he tried 10mg pure baeocystin and it didn&#x27;t produce hallucinogenic effects but did produce pupil dilation and apparent anxiolysis.

The reasons for the apparently non-hallucinogenic nature of norpsilocin, baeocystin, and related compounds in animals (and possibly in humans), in spite of norpsilocin and others being potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists and producing other centrally mediated behavioral effects in animals, remain unknown. One possibility however is that these compounds may be biased agonists of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and may not sufficiently activate the intracellular signaling cascades responsible for psychedelic effects.

==Development==
Baeocystin is being evaluated by Pilz Bioscience (&quot;pilz&quot; being German for &quot;mushroom&quot;) under the developmental code name PLZ-1019 for the possible treatment of pervasive developmental disorders like autism in children.

<doc id="1132285" wikidata="Q1754404" url="?curid=1132285" title="The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)">
<text>The Best of Both Worlds is the second greatest hits album by American rock band Van Halen, released on July 20, 2004, on Warner Bros. The compilation features material recorded with lead vocalists David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, but omits Gary Cherone&#x27;s three-year tenure with the band. Prior to &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;&#x27;s release, Hagar reunited with Van Halen, and the band recorded three new tracks to include on the release.

Debuting at #3 in the US, the album coincided with a reunion tour, and certified Platinum. It is the last Van Halen album to feature contributions from Michael Anthony and Hagar.

==Background==
The compilation features 16 tracks taken from the six David Lee Roth era albums (1978–1984), and 14 from the four Sammy Hagar era albums (1986–1995), plus three live songs with Hagar from &quot;&quot; (1993), and three new songs with Hagar made for the compilation. The album was released in promotion of the new reunion tour featuring Hagar returning as lead singer. The three new songs were also performed live at various times.

Michael Anthony did not play bass guitar for the three new songs, although he did provide backing vocals for them. Anthony was not an official band member at that point and the songs were recorded before he rejoined. The bass guitar on the new songs was played by Eddie Van Halen.

According to Anthony, the original plans involved one disc of songs recorded with Roth and another of songs recorded with Hagar, with the three new songs appearing on the Roth disc.

==Track listing==

Notes

*Track 15 on disc one, &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot;, is the single edit version (with the first snare drum hit removed), not the version that appeared on &quot;Diver Down&quot;. The album version segues directly from the preceding track, &quot;Intruder&quot;.
*Track 10 on disc two combines the instrumental &quot;Strung Out&quot; with &quot;Not Enough&quot;, although it is shown on the album track list as simply &quot;Not Enough&quot;. Both songs are listed as individual tracks on &quot;Balance&quot;.

<text>Tamaz Nadareishvili () (19 July 1954 – 31 August 2004) was a Georgian politician who served as head of the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, a government-in-exile for the breakaway province.

Nadareishvili was a great grandson of the famous Abkhaz prince Shervashidze. Born and raised in Sukhumi, Nadareishvili attended Sukhumi University, graduated in the early 1980s, and settled down to life as an academic writer.

During the break-up of the Soviet Union, Nadareishvili became involved in Georgian National Liberation movement. After the war in Abkhazia, Nadareishvili was elected by fellow Georgian refugees as the head of an exile government. In the 1990s he served at times in the Georgian parliament, continuing to draw support from refugees, to whom he helped distribute government aid.

As head of the Council, Nadareishvili loudly supported military action to retake Abkhazia. Allegations were made claiming him being involved in paramilitary operations on the Abkhaz/Georgia administrative border. The Forest Brothers under Dato Shengelia and the White Legion under Zurab Samushia were both allegedly associated with the Supreme Council. 

Nadareishvili remained neutral during the Rose Revolution that ousted Eduard Shevardnadze in favor of Mikhail Saakashvili. However, Nadareishvili soon faced a revolt of his own, and resigned in January 2004 after a vote of no confidence by the Supreme Council. In 2005 he published a book (&quot;Conspiracy Against Georgia&quot;), which mostly includes information about ethnic cleansing and genocide of Georgian population in Abkhazia.

Nadareishvili died of a heart attack on August 31, 2004.

<text>The Passetto di Borgo, or simply Passetto, is an elevated passage that links the Vatican City with the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. It is an approximately corridor, located in the rione of Borgo. It was erected in 1277 by Pope Nicholas III, but parts of the wall were built by Totila during the Gothic War.

On at least two occasions it served as an escape route for Popes in danger. Pope Alexander VI crossed it in 1494, when Charles VIII invaded the city and the pope&#x27;s life was in peril. Clement VII escaped to safety through this passage during the Sack of Rome in 1527, when troops of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, massacred almost the entire Swiss Guard on the steps of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

<doc id="1132296" wikidata="Q575041" url="?curid=1132296" title="Mann (paramilitary rank)">
<text>Mann (), was a paramilitary rank used by several Nazi Party paramilitary organizations between 1925 and 1945. The rank is most often associated with the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS-Mann), but also was a rank of the SA, where &quot;Mann&quot; (SA-Mann) was the lowest enlisted rank and was the equivalent of a private.

In 1938, with the rise of the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (later renamed the Waffen-SS), the SS changed the rank of &quot;Mann&quot; to &quot;Schütze&quot;, although it still retained the original SS rank of &quot;Mann&quot; for the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; (general SS). The rank of &quot;Mann&quot; was junior to SS-&quot;Sturmmann&quot;.

In most Nazi Party organizations, the rank of &quot;Mann&quot; held no distinctive insignia. Some groups, however, granted a minor form of rank insignia such as a blank collar patch or simple shoulder board to denote the rank of &quot;Mann&quot;. (see right: SS rank insignia pattern from 1933)

Even lower ranks, e.g. &quot;Bewerber, Jungmann, Anwärter, Vollanwärter&quot;, were established in the mid-1930s as a recruit or candidate position, held by an individual seeking an appointment as a &quot;Mann&quot; in a Nazi Party paramilitary organization.

<doc id="1132311" wikidata="Q689406" url="?curid=1132311" title="Schütze">
<text>Schütze in German means &quot;rifleman&quot; or &quot;shooter&quot;, or in older terms originally connoted &quot;archer&quot; before the advent of the rifle. It also occasionally occurs as a surname, or as Schütz, as in the opera &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. The word itself is derived from the German word &quot;schützen&quot;, meaning to protect, or to guard. It was originally used for archers as they protected castle walls, and is the German equivalent to Sagittarius, the mythical form which held bow and arrow.

==Overview==

As a rank of the Armed Forces of Germany in First World War until 1918, &quot;Schütze&quot; was used for the lowest enlisted ranks in machine gun units and some elite troops like Saxon &quot;Schützen&quot;-Regiment 108 exclusively. Usually translated as &quot;private&quot;, from 1920 on it names the lowest enlisted rank of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; infantry. The equivalent of &quot;Schütze&quot; in the other branches of the German military was &quot;Jäger&quot;, &quot;Kanonier&quot;, &quot;Pionier&quot;, &quot;Kraftfahrer&quot; or &quot;Grenadier&quot; in the army; &quot;Flieger&quot; in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, &quot;Matrose&quot; in the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, respectively.

; Rank insignia of a &quot;Schütze&quot; of the Heer until 1942 (the rank of Schütze became Grenadier after 1942):

== Second World War ==
During the Second World War, it also became a rank in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, SS-&quot;Schütze&quot;. Other branches of the SS referred to the rank as &quot;Mann&quot;.

; Insignia of rank &quot;Schütze&quot; of the Waffen-SS:
== Modern-day Schütze ==
The present-day German military maintains &quot;Schütze&quot; as the lowest enlisted grade, with a NATO rank code of OR-1. A &quot;Schütze&quot; ranks below &quot;Gefreiter&quot; which is the equivalent of a private (OR-2); the equivalent of a private first class being an &quot;Obergefreiter&quot; or &quot;Hauptgefreiter&quot;.

During various periods in German military history, a senior private rank known as &quot;Oberschütze&quot; existed between the grades of &quot;Schütze&quot; and &quot;Gefreiter&quot;. In the modern German Army the rank of &quot;Schütze&quot; is not used very often. Every part of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; has a different name for this rank. For example, in the &quot;Panzergrenadiertruppe&quot; (heavy mechanized infantry) the name of the rank is &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot;, and within the &quot;Fernmelder&quot; (communication troops), the name is &quot;Funker&quot; (radio operator).

<doc id="1132313" wikidata="Q1321313" url="?curid=1132313" title="List of medieval universities">
<text>The list of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] comprises universities (more precisely, &quot;studia generalia&quot;) which existed in Europe during the Middle Ages. It also includes short-lived foundations and European educational institutions whose university status is a matter of debate. The degree-awarding university with its corporate organization and relative autonomy is a product of medieval Christian Europe. Before the year 1500, over eighty universities were established in Western and Central Europe. During the subsequent Colonization of the Americas the university was introduced to the New World, marking the beginning of its worldwide spread as the center of higher learning everywhere (see List of oldest universities).

== Definition ==

There were many institutions of learning (&quot;studia&quot;) in the Middle Ages in Latin Europe—cathedral schools, &quot;schools of rhetoric&quot; (law faculties), etc. Historians generally restrict the term &quot;medieval university&quot; to refer to an institution of learning that was referred to as a &quot;studium generale&quot; in the Middle Ages.

There is no official strict definition of a &quot;studium generale&quot;, the term having emerged from customary usage. The following properties were common among them, and are often treated as defining criteria:
# It received students from everywhere (not merely the local district or region);
# It engaged in higher learning—i.e., that it went beyond teaching the Arts, and had at least one of the higher faculties (Theology, Law or Medicine).
# A significant part of the teaching was done by Masters (teachers with a higher degree)
# It enjoyed the privilege of &quot;jus ubique docendi&quot;—i.e., masters of that school were entitled to teach in any other school without a preliminary examination.
# Its teachers and students were allowed to enjoy any clerical benefices they might have elsewhere without meeting the mandatory residency requirements prescribed by Canon Law
# It enjoyed some degree of autonomy from local civil and diocesan authorities.

Charters issued by the Pope or Holy Roman Emperor were often needed to ensure privileges 4–6. The fourth condition (teaching elsewhere without examination) was originally considered by scholars of the time to be the most important criterion, with the result that the appellation &quot;studium generale&quot; was customarily reserved to refer only to the oldest and most prestigious schools—specifically Salerno, Bologna, Paris, and sometimes Oxford—until this oligopoly was broken by papal and imperial charters in the course of the 13th century. The fifth criterion (continued benefices) was the closest there was to an &quot;official&quot; definition of a &quot;studium generale&quot; used by the Church and academics from the 14th century onwards, although there were some notable exceptions (e.g., neither Oxford nor Padua received this right, but they were nonetheless universally considered &quot;&quot;Studia Generalia&quot; by custom&quot;).

Modern historians have tended to focus on the first three requirements (students from everywhere, at least one higher faculty, teaching by masters). This has led to contention in making lists of Medieval universities. Some Italian universities, for instance, were quick to obtain papal charters and thus the privileges and title of a &quot;studium generale&quot;, but their student catchment never went much beyond the local district or they had only a couple of masters engaged in teaching. Other comparable schools (notably the more prestigious cathedral schools of France), may have had wider student catchment and more masters, but neglected or failed to secure the chartered privileges and thus were never referred to as &quot;studia generalia&quot;. It is common to include the former and exclude the latter from lists of &quot;Medieval universities&quot;, but some historians have disputed this convention as arbitrary and unreflective of the state of higher learning in Europe.

Some historians have discarded the &quot;studium generale&quot; definition, and come up with their own criteria for a definition of a &quot;university&quot;—narrowing it by requiring, for instance, that a university have all three higher faculties (Theology, Law, Medicine) in order to be considered a &quot;Medieval university&quot; (very few had all three), whereas others widen it to include some of the more prestigious cathedral schools, palace schools and universities outside of Latin Europe (notably in the Greek and Islamic world, for example the Pandidakterion founded by the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II in 425 or University of al-Qarawiyyin in Morocco founded by Fatima al-Fihri in 859, which may be the &quot;first university in the world and the oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world&quot;).

There is also contention on the founding dates of many universities. Using the date of acquisition of a papal and royal/imperial charter is inadequate, as the older universities, believing their status and reputations sufficient and indisputable, refused or resisted asking for an official charter for a long time. Some historians trace the founding of a university to the first date when evidence of some kind of teaching was done in that locality, even if only local and limited. Others wait until there is evidence of higher learning, a wide student catchment, the emergence of its masters teaching elsewhere or a more definitive mention of it as a &quot;studium generale&quot;.

<doc id="1132318" wikidata="Q1539935" url="?curid=1132318" title="Virgin Black">
<text>Virgin Black is an Australian symphonic gothic and doom metal band. The band was signed to The End Records (for the United States) and Germany&#x27;s Massacre Records (for Europe), through which it released four albums and one EP. A fifth album, originally planned for release in 2006, was released independently in 2018. As of 2021, they are signed to Australian record label, Dark Escapes Music. Formed in 1995 in Adelaide, they have achieved international acclaim during their career, receiving praise from such magazines as &quot;Orkus&quot;, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, &quot;Legacy&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

Having changed their line-up several times, Virgin Black currently consists of the founding members and main songwriters: Sesca Scaarba (formerly Samantha Escarbe) (guitar) and Rowan London (keyboard, vocals), with Grayh (bass) and Luke Faz (drums) joining in 2007. The group explains the meaning of its name as &quot;the juxtaposition of purity and humanity&#x27;s darkness&quot;.

==History==
===Early days===
Virgin Black was originally formed in Adelaide by guitarist Sesca Scaarba, and vocalist and keyboards-player Rowan London. In 1995, Virgin Black recorded a four-track self-titled demo in a doom/death style. Due to the rarity and demand for this recording, the band has speculated that it may be re-released at some point. Their &quot;Trance&quot; EP was released in 1998, and the group began gaining international recognition with that recording. This EP was later included as part of a special limited edition (U.S. only) with the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Sombre Romantic&quot;.

===Record deal===

The group began recording their first full-length album &quot;Sombre Romantic&quot; in 1999.
The album displays an expansively cinematic, symphonic style with London contributing a diverse vocal style from shrieks and growls to soaring melodies and choral chants. On the strength of this self-released debut, Virgin Black signed to Germany&#x27;s Massacre Records for Europe and also to the U.S. label The End. Both labels then released &quot;Sombre Romantic&quot; in their territories.

After completing their second album during 2002, Virgin Black played at Germany&#x27;s Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in 2003 and did a tour through the US west coast with Agalloch and Antimatter before returning to Australia and conducting a national tour. &quot;Elegant... and Dying&quot; featured Escarbe contributing cello and guest musician Sonia Wilkie playing flute. It was released in November and a month later the band appeared at the Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra. Early the following year, Virgin Black toured alongside Opeth in Australia, and later did a tour of the Australian east coast capitals with Sydney black metal band Nazxul before making a start on their next recordings.

===&quot;Requiem&quot; trilogy===
Virgin Black&#x27;s next project began with London and Escarbe composing a series of scores for what was to become the three-volume &quot;Requiem&quot; set. On 10 March 2006, The End Records issued a press release explaining the upcoming releases. The first part of the trilogy, &quot;Requiem - Pianissimo&quot;, is a strictly classically oriented album featuring the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, choral singing, and solo singers. &quot;Requiem - Mezzo Forte&quot; features music similar to the band&#x27;s previous releases with the last part &quot;Requiem - Fortissimo&quot; primarily having a death/doom metal sound. The albums were recorded primarily as the duo of London and Escarbe over the course of almost two years, during which Rowan London suffered the death of his father. Originally designed to be released simultaneously in 2006, on 23 July, The Labels announced that the albums would instead be released during 2007 in a staggered time scale. The second part of the trilogy, &quot;Requiem - Mezzo Forte&quot; was issued first, on 3 April 2007.

With a new line-up of Escarbe, London, Grayh on bass and drummer Luke Faz. Virgin Black played some Australian shows with Arcturus in March and headlined the Elements of Rock Festival in Switzerland in April. Virgin Black announced a US tour for June and July 2007, and played shows on the east and west coast of the U.S. with To/Die/For and headlined shows in Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara.

The third part and the second installment in the &quot;Requiem&quot; trilogy, &quot;Requiem - Fortissimo&quot; was released on 19 February 2008 by The End Records. The Massacre Records release date remains unknown. Virgin Black played with Amorphis and Samael for a North American tour in fall 2008. Readers of the website &quot;Metal Storm&quot; voted &quot;Requiem Fortissimo&quot; for &quot;the best doom metal album of 2008&quot;.

On 2 November 2012 it was announced on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page that &quot;...Virgin Black is still on an extended hiatus but preparing themselves for a return at some stage, and the release of Pianissimo when that happens&quot;, and went on to say that &quot;...it might not be for some time yet, but thank you for your patience and continued enthusiasm for the band regardless&quot;.

On 4 September 2018, after 10 years of silence, the band posted the first two songs from their long-awaited &quot;Pianissimo&quot; release. The songs are titled &quot;Requiem Aeternum&quot; and &quot;Dies Irae&quot;, with a total duration of 13:12. On 27 September 2018, the band speculated the date for the release of the complete album, scheduled for 30 November of that year, said in its official website that Virgin Black has broken ties with former record companies. In December 2018 the album appeared on YouTube.

On signing with new label Dark Escapes Music, Virgin Black&#x27;s Requiem trilogy was slated for release to streaming services globally. &quot;Requiem - Pianissimo&quot;, the first of the trilogy, was released on 30 June 2023 and is to be followed by &quot;Requiem - Mezzo Forte&quot; on 28 July 2023 and &quot;Requiem - Fortissimo&quot; on 18 August 2023. While the latter two albums were available on some streaming services in North America, this is the first time they will be available globally.

=== Virgin Black Return ===
On 25 November 2021, Virgin Black released &quot;Sombre Romantic&quot; on streaming services globally after signing with independent record label Dark Escapes Music. A cinematic music video for Walk Without Limbs was released on YouTube to accompany the release.

This was followed by &quot;Elegant... and Dying&quot; a year later on 25 November 2022, and &quot;Requiem - Pianissimo&quot; on 30 June 2023. This is the first time &quot;Requiem - Pianissimo&quot; has been available on streaming services since its original release in 2018.

==Style and influence==
Virgin Black&#x27;s sound combines elements of doom metal and classical music. A critic described their style as having influences of &quot;dark wave with gothic atmosphere&quot; and &quot;symphonic gothic-doom&quot;. Virgin Black states that their influences include the British group My Dying Bride, the American gothic metal band Saviour Machine and 19th century classical music. Their sound is typically sorrowful, representing mostly down-tempo arrangements. Rowan London employs various vocal styles including operatic, shrieking, death growls and melodramatic tenor and baritone singing, and the music often features choirs. Occasionally the lead guitarist Sesca Scaarba plays faster tremolo riffs typical of extreme metal, such as on &quot;Drink the Midnight Hymn&quot; from the debut album. Sometimes there are longer, mellow and emotional guitar solos such as on &quot;Weep for Me&quot;. A great deal of variety can be found in their music. For instance, &quot;Walk without Limbs&quot; combines ominous cello with programmed drums for a softer darkwave style, the &quot;Requiem - Pianissimo&quot; album is entirely classical, whereas &quot;Requiem - Fortissimo&quot;&#x27;s sound is firmly rooted in death/doom metal.

<doc id="1132324" wikidata="Q7801137" url="?curid=1132324" title="Tierrasanta, San Diego">
<text>Tierrasanta, Spanish for &quot;holy land,&quot; or &quot;holy ground&quot;, is a community in San Diego, California. The symbol of Tierrasanta is an encircled Conquistador cross, similar to one atop Montserrat mountain near Barcelona, Spain, though it no longer holds any religious meaning. The community is referred to as &quot;The Island in the Hills&quot; by locals and on welcome signs, as there are only four roads that lead to Tierrasanta, all which end within the community.

==History==
Tierrasanta was originally part of the Mission San Diego de Alcalá ranch, which was active during the late 18th and 19th centuries. The U.S. military purchased the land in 1941 as Camp Elliott, a Marine Corps training facility. The Marines moved out in 1944 and the land was transferred to the Navy. It was deactivated in 1946. In 1961, the U.S. Government sold the area that is now Tierrasanta and a portion of neighboring Mission Trails Regional Park to the City of San Diego. In the following year, the Elliott Community Plan was issued to serve as a roadmap for development going forward, and in 1971 Tierrasanta was founded. The current Tierrasanta community plan was first issued in 1982, and included both the currently developed area and much of what is now Mission Trails Regional Park. Meanwhile, the first master plan for what was to become Mission Trails Regional Park was issued in 1976 with the aid of numerous public agencies, planning groups, and a 45-member Technical Advisory Committee.

Tierrasanta&#x27;s population had reached about 24,000 by 1980 and when the 1982 Plan was issued the area called Tierrasanta Norte, in the northeastern part of town, had yet to be fully developed. Tierrasanta has been almost fully built out since the early 1990s, and in 2010 had a population of 30,443 (ZIP code 92124). Some 2,300 homes grouped in the southwest portion of town are part of the Murphy Canyon military housing complex. Tierrasanta was one of the first master planned communities in San Diego.

The original Community Plan called for an eastward extension of Clairemont Mesa Boulevard, with connections to Jackson Drive on the south and Route 52 on the north. However, there long was opposition to the plan due to expected increased high speed traffic. The 2019 Master Plan Update to Mission Trails Regional Park apparently settled the issue when it declared the plan to no longer be implementable due to resource management requirements.

In addition, there was supposed to be a connection from Tierrasanta Boulevard to Princess View Drive, but this was never constructed. There are also no plans to connect the two Santo Road segments.

Because of the area&#x27;s history as a military training base, some military debris including unexploded ordnance remained in the area when it was developed, in spite of multiple cleanup efforts by different branches of the services. In 1983 two 8-year-old Tierrasanta boys were killed after discovering unexploded ordnance in a canyon near their home. The military has performed clearance operations as recently as 1994 and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to investigate the area every five years under its FUDS Formerly Used Defense Sites program.

In October 2003, Tierrasanta, among other communities in San Diego, was affected by what was known as &quot;Firestorm 2003.&quot; This was a conglomeration of the Cedar Fire and numerous other wildfires that converged on Southern California. The residents of Tierrasanta were forced to evacuate. Nearly a dozen homes were lost to the blaze. Shortly after, in 2004, the Tierrasanta Community Emergency Response Team (T-CERT) was created for rapid local response to natural disasters. A similar scare swept through Tierrasanta in the fall of 2007, though residents were not required to evacuate.

==Geography==
The developed part of Tierrasanta, which rises from west to east and includes numerous canyons, is situated like an island, not directly bordered by any other community. It is bounded on the north by the Mount Soledad (52) Freeway and the sprawling southern fields of MCAS Miramar; on the east by the Mission Trails Regional Park, which has numerous hiking and mountain biking trails; on the west by slopes overlooking the wide Interstate 15 corridor running from Friars Road to Route 52, and on the south with homes overlooking the Admiral Baker Golf Course and the San Diego River. Community activities focus on the Tierrasanta Recreation Center, which includes lighted sports fields, a large swimming pool, tennis courts managed by the Tierrasanta Tennis Club, a gymnasium, and meeting rooms. Numerous green belts with walking paths run through the canyons, and are maintained by the Friends of the Tierrasanta Canyons. There are a number of entrances to Mission Trails Regional Park, including an entrance with parking at the eastern end of Clairemont Mesa Boulevard.

Like most of the coastal areas in Southern California, the natural habitat in the canyons and other undeveloped areas within Tierrasanta, as well as in much of MCAS Miramar and Mission Trails Regional Park, is coastal sage scrub and chaparral.

As described in its 1982 Community Plan, Tierrasanta is a community of single family homes, condominiums, apartments, three shopping centers, a branch of the San Diego Public Library, and a research park. Also located in the community are several elementary and middle schools and Canyon Hills High School, part of San Diego Unified School District.

==Government and culture==

The elected Tierrasanta Community Council (TCC), which includes members from each of five geographic areas, plus representatives for commercial, Village Mission Valley Apartments, and Canyon Hills High, has responsibility for community planning and for advising the City of San Diego and other government agencies on local issues. The TCC supports numerous events in the community such as the Concert in the park series, the Patriots Day Parade honoring Armed Forces Day on the third Saturday in May, Oktoberfest and other events.

Dedicated open space areas and landscaped medians are maintained by the Tierrasanta Maintenance Assessment District, which was established in 1972 and most recently approved by voters in 1997. The 818 acres of Tierrasanta Open Space qualifies this urban park as one of the 150 largest in the United States.

The &quot;Friends of Tierrasanta Canyons&quot; is a Tierrasanta-based volunteer group that maintains the open spaces of the neighborhood&#x27;s canyons.

As of 2021 Tierrasanta&#x27;s elected representatives included San Diego City Councilman Raul Campillo, County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer of District 3, State Assembly Member Brian Maienschein, Democrat, of District 77, State Senator Toni Atkins, Democrat, of District 39, and Congressman Scott Peters, Democrat, of California&#x27;s 52nd District.

==Cultural amenities==
The community has a branch library, jogging/mountain biking trails, baseball and soccer teams, and numerous clubs. The Tierra Times, a community service newspaper, has been published since 1971, and is delivered free to all residents six or more times per year.

An Armed Services YMCA is located in the Murphy Canyon area. Navy Region Southwest&#x27;s Admiral Baker Golf Club on the southern edge of Tierrasanta has two golf courses with priority given to active duty and retired military members, but is also open to civilians from nearby communities such as Tierrasanta.

<text>Bioherbicides are herbicides consisting of phytotoxins, pathogens, and other microbes used as biological weed control. Bioherbicides may be compounds and secondary metabolites derived from microbes such as fungi, bacteria or protozoa; or phytotoxic plant residues, extracts or single compounds derived from other plant species.

== Production ==
The production of bioherbicides is a process of biosynthesis where different mediums ranging from soybean bran to corn steep liquor are fermented to obtain desirable results. In addition to solid-state fermentation, bioherbicides can also be produced by submerged fermentation in stirred tanks or in other environments. Despite the ‘eco-friendliness’, there are several obstructions that make it less practical to use bioherbicides in fields because the lab results may not be the same as the real results.

== Current status ==
With increasing awareness of the effects of the chemical herbicides and pesticides, bioherbicides can be adopted as an alternative especially for integrated weed management. The market share of bioherbicides is merely 10% of all biopesticides. On the other hand, the research spanning over two decades since 1980s has also falsified the principle that there is a coevolved natural enemy of a host weed which can manage weed through varied formulation and thus advocated for more research to culturally and genetically intensify the bioherbicidal organisms. Efficiency and efficacy of bioherbicides is impeded by changing weather and temperature and this can further obstruct the application and integration of bioherbicides. A study shows that covering with jute turf, which retains moistures and allows one third of the sunlight to pass through, can increase the efficiency of bioherbicides and also remove some of the hindrances from the commercialization and marketing of bioherbicides.

While it is true that after their &#x27;discovery&#x27; the bioherbicides are not readily available on the market for various reasons, advocates of bioherbicides argue that bioherbicide researchers should collaborate with other researchers and seek more public sector funding so that bioherbicides can become more marketable and attain more market share. Simultaneously, research from Canada indicates that legislative and policy dynamics have great power to accelerate the innovation and integration of bioherbicides other microbial pest-control products.

== Available bioherbicides ==
While 13 different products have been launched, , only nine bioherbicides were being marketed:
# Devine (1981)
# Collego (1982)
# BioMal (1992)
# Woad Warrior (2002)
# Chontrol (2005)
# Smoulder (2005)
# Sarritor (2007)
# Organo-Sol (2010)
# Beloukha (2015)

<text>Bouaké (or Bwake, N’ko: ߓߐ߰ߞߍ߫ &quot;Bɔ̀ɔkɛ́&quot;) is the second-largest city in Ivory Coast, with a population of 740,000 (2021 census). It is the seat of three levels of subdivision—Vallée du Bandama District, Gbêkê Region, and Bouaké Department. The city is located in the central part of Ivory Coast about northeast of Lake Kossou, the country&#x27;s largest lake. It is approximately north of Abidjan on the Abidjan-Niger Railway and about northeast of Yamoussoukro, the capital of the country.

== Name ==
For the name of the city Bouaké, there are two possible origins:

* The corruption of the chief name Kwa Gbéké that made the foundations of the city of Bouaké.
* The name Bouaké coming from two Baoulé words: &quot;Boua&quot; which means sheep and &quot;Ké&quot; which means dry. Thus it is the place where sheep are dried, as they would have seen Jula drying sheep skins when they arrived in Bouaké.

== Demographics ==
== History ==
In the 1800s a group related to the Akan, the Assabou and Baoulé settled in the vicinity of where Bouaké was, initially the village was named Gbèkèkro, so named after the leader of the Baoulé, Gossan Kwa Gbeke and kro meaning town or settlement of.

Bouaké was established as a French military post in 1899 and has been an administrative center since 1914.

French and United Nations peacekeepers currently reside in the city as part of an enforced ceasefire between the rebel-held north and the government-held south. After the attempt to overthrow the president Laurent Gbagbo had failed, the rebel forces FN (&quot;forces nouvelles&quot;) led by Guillaume Soro made Bouaké their center of control. Subsequently, Bouaké University, opened in 1996, was closed down in September 2002. Financed by Unesco, the university reopened in April, 2005.

On 4 November 2004, governmental forces used Sukhoi-25s to raid the city as an opening movement towards &quot;territorial liberation&quot;, according to Captain Jean-Noël Abbey of the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire army. Korhogo, north of Bouaké, was also targeted.
In 2014, the population of the sub-prefecture of Bouaké-SP was 71,949.

== Climate ==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Bouaké&#x27;s climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw). The city features a lengthy wet season spanning the months of March through October, and a shorter harmattan-influenced dry season that covers the remaining 4 months. Despite the lengthy wet season, Bouaké does not see the level of rainfall experienced in Abidjan. Bouaké on average sees roughly of precipitation annually.

== Economy ==

Tobacco products, building materials, and textiles are produced, and cotton sisal and rice are processed. Gold, mercury, and manganese are found nearby. The overall economy was shaken during the near decade long rebel rule that started in 2002. Many companies either shut down or relocated to Abidjan, Ivory Coast&#x27;s coastal economic hub. These events resulted in the 60% reduction in formal employment. For example, the city&#x27;s biggest textile mill, the Gonfreville Establishment, saw an employment decrease of 1200 workers, an 80% reduction. Economic recovery was slow until the early 2010s. After the State took back control of Bouake after the 2010-2011 election, the economy moved into a state of reconstruction. Roads were repaved after years of neglect, which allowed the transportation of goods to become an easier task. Cash crops such as cotton and cashews started to be transported in higher quantities to be processed in Bouake. Singapore-based Olam opened a cashew processing plant in Bouake in 2012, which accounts for nearly 2400 jobs. The agribusiness as a whole is beginning to turn to its original state before the rebel conflict. Additionally, banks have opened new branches and supermarkets have returned to normal operation. The government is stimulating this regrowth through policies, such as price floors, and projects to increase trade, including the construction of a highway to connect Bouake to the nation&#x27;s capital, Yamoussoukro.

== Transports ==
The city has the Bouaké Airport located north-west of the city with a runway.

Located on the line of the railway which connects Abidjan to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, the city has the Railway Station Bouaké operated by Sitarail.

The roads that connect Bouaké are the A3 and the A8 going clockwise from the north the A3 connects Katiola and with Korhogo on the A12 eastwards with further destinations in Burkina Faso and Mali. Eastwards the A10 starts in Bouaké and connects to Ghana and to Bondoukou via the A1 northwards and Abengourou southwards. The A8 connects to Abengourou northwards on the A1 and Abidjan southwards. A3 Southbound connects to the political capital Yamoussoukro and the economic capital Abidjan. A8 westbound goes to Beoumi and Lake Kossou continuing to Man and Danané with further destinations in Liberia and Guinea.

== Education ==
The Université Alassane Ouattara was founded in 1992.

== Places of worship == 
The most common places of worship are Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bouaké (Catholic Church), United Methodist Church Ivory Coast (World Methodist Council), Union of Missionary Baptist Churches in Ivory Coast (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God.

<text>Claudio Stampi (born 19 June 1953, in São Paulo, Brazil) is the founder (in 1997), director and sole proprietor of the Chronobiology Research Institute which he runs from his home in Newton, Massachusetts, US. He is an academic sleep-researcher with a particular interest in the use of short naps in extreme conditions.

== Life ==

Born to Italian parents in Bresil, he moved to Italy as a teenager and earned a doctorate in medicine in 1977, followed by a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering in 1983, and a degree in neurology the following year from the University of Bologna in Italy.
An avid sailor since his early youth, his MD-thesis was based on data he had collected during the 1975 Clipper Race, the first race he participated in, on the performance in relation to their sleep habits of the six team members on board.

That marked the start of his particular research interest in chronobiology, leading him to follow a number of his fellow long distance sail boat racing comrades, who had adopted a systematic polyphasic sleep pattern with minimal impairment. Stampi participated in two global sail races, including the 1981-2 Whitbread Race, where he served as Chief Scientist and Skipper of the research yacht &quot;La Barca Laboratorio&quot;; a boat that did not finish the race.

Building on his experience, he continued in the following years to work as a consultant for many single-hand competitive sailors to help them adapt their on-board sleeping habits for maximum performance. Among his most notable clients were Mike Golding and famous sailor Ellen MacArthur, who won the Transat in 2000 and beat a new record for a single-handed global circumnavigation following his napping advice. 
James Maas, a professor specialised in the same field at Cornell University in the US praised Stampis empirical work based on the observation of more than 100 solo sailors as very useful.
While his consulting activity, side by side with his ongoing research, mainly benefitted sailors, he also worked for NASA astronauts, long-haul truck drivers and jet-lagged executives.

From 1987 to 1989 he was responsible for the project &quot;Ultrashort sleep: a strategy for optimal performance during sustained operations&quot; funded by the Canadian Government at the University of Ottawa.
In 1990 he started a controlled study at the Institute of Circadian Physiology&#x27;s research labs in Cambridge, Massachusetts: He divided his test subjects into three groups:
Each group would sleep only three hours a day. The first group would take all three hours at once, the second would sleep an hour and a half at night and then take three naps during the day and the last group —the true polyphasics— would take their sleep in half-hour naps every four hours.
After establishing a baseline performance after eight hours of sleep, he compared the results: After more than a month, the first group showed a loss of 30% , the second 25% and the third only 12% in performance.

He is the editor and contributor of three chapters to &quot;Why We Nap: Evolution, Chronobiology, and Functions of Polyphasic and Ultrashort Sleep&quot;. The book is considered a reference on the subject and widely available in academic libraries, six editions were published between 1992 and 2014 with a foreword by Jürgen Aschoff, the co-founder of the field of chronobiology. He also wrote more than 100 research papers on his work.

<doc id="1132335" wikidata="Q2306306" url="?curid=1132335" title="The House of Eliott">
<text>The House of Eliott is a British television series produced and broadcast by the BBC in three series between 31 August 1991 and 6 March 1994. The series starred Stella Gonet as Beatrice Eliott and Louise Lombard as Evangeline Eliott, two sisters in 1920s London who establish a dressmaking business and eventually their own haute couture fashion house, Aden Gillett as photographer and film maker Jack Maddox and Maggie Ollerenshaw as head of the workroom Florence Ranby. It was created by Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, who had previously devised &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. The series was written by several writers, including Jill Hyem, Peter Buckman, Deborah Cook and Ginnie Hole.

==Plot==

=== Series One ===
Beatrice (30, known as Bea) and Evangeline (18, known as Evie) Eliott are left orphans by the sudden death of their tyrannical father, Henry Eliott. Left almost destitute and without any education, the sisters are forced to sell the family home to cover their father&#x27;s debts. To earn money, they make use of their passion for dressmaking and Bea gets a job as secretary at a local photography studio run by Jack Maddox. Jack and his sister Penelope become firm friends of the sisters and Jack provides them with the funds to open their own London based dressmaking business &quot;The House of Eliott&quot;. Through their relationship with Penelope Maddox, the sisters meet the loyal and hardworking seamstress Tilly Watkins whom they employ. A consistent theme throughout the series is the struggle of women in the 1920s to live fulfilling and independent lives—for some the struggle is simply to survive. Not only does Henry Eliott leave his daughters penniless and uneducated, but their cousin Arthur, who is executor of their father&#x27;s estate, and Evie&#x27;s legal guardian, keeps a rightful inheritance from the girls &quot;for their own good&quot;. After Arthur&#x27;s arrest and imprisonment for involvement in drug smuggling, he emigrates to Boston, USA, releasing a large amount of cash owed to the sisters from their father&#x27;s estate. This allows Beatrice and Evie to expand the business and, by the end of series one, with the help of Evie&#x27;s godfather, successful businessman Sir Desmond Gillispie, the future looks good. Evie celebrates her twenty-first birthday and is made a partner in the firm. The House of Eliott releases its first independent fashion collection and is creating exclusive designs for the aristocracy.

=== Series Two ===
Spring 1924: the Eliott sisters have employed Florence Ranby, a dour Victorian, as head of the workroom. Beatrice and Evie are invited to Paris by fashion designer Gilles Caragnac, who offers them a 5-year contract as designers for his label. While there, Bea marries her former employer and friend Jack Maddox, and they move back to London, leaving Evie alone in Paris to work at the fashion house &quot;Maison Gilles&quot;. After a year and an affair with Gilles Caragnac, a newly-glamorous and grown-up Evie returns as a designer for House of Eliott. Jack&#x27;s movie director career is on the rise. At a showing of one of Jack&#x27;s films, Evie meets Lord Alexander Montford, a married member of Parliament, with whom she begins an affair, causing complications throughout the series. Jack and Beatrice separate, unable to agree about having children and the pressure of work. The House of Eliott faces ruin after the suspicious death of Sir Desmond Gillispie causes the firm&#x27;s financial affairs to be taken over by Ralph Saroyan. The sisters suspect Saroyan of dishonesty and through their contact with Sir Alexander Montford, cause the bank to be officially investigated. It is discovered that Saroyan is defrauding most of the customers of the bank and the Eliott sisters are left with very little of their original savings and investments.

Jack&#x27;s movie &quot;The Strikers&quot; is successful and a Hollywood producer offers him work in the U.S. by a Hollywood producer. Jack turns it down to instead work in Berlin. Meanwhile, as the market for couture gowns wanes during the late 1920s Great Depression, Beatrice and Evangeline are offered a tour of America showing their new ready-to-wear designs for Sears and Roebuck. Bea still has feelings for Jack. Back at the fashion house, after a crisis of confidence, Tilly marries Norman Foss, a young chef in a local hotel, and is reinstated as head of the workroom. She announces her pregnancy in the last episode of the series.

Friction exists between Florence Ranby and Tilly. An annoyed Florence walks out of the Eliott workroom and narrowly misses being hit by a car. Tilly has many quarrels with Florence due to her short, sharp manner. Eventually, after Evie allows them to fix a fur collar in Madge&#x27;s way rather than Florence&#x27;s, Florence resign and walks out; this time she is fatally struck by a car. At the funeral Mr Ranby, Florence&#x27;s husband, confronts Madge and Tilly after their apology to him. He then confronts Bea and Evie over Florence&#x27;s death and how she was treated. He particularly blames Bea and Evie for failing to notice the ongoing conflict and says Florence was loyal and would not hear a word said against them. Later, however, he returns, apologising for his outburst and gives flowers to Madge and Tilly. He mentions he is a tailor. Needing an expert cutter, Bea and Evie consider offering him a job; but they decide against it, concerned that the House&#x27;s connection to Florence&#x27;s death would be too difficult for him. They instead hire Charles Quance.

=== Series Three ===
The Eliott sisters and employee Madge are wrapping up their evidently successful visit to the United States under the sponsorship of Sears and Roebuck, which wants to carry a line of ready-to-wear designed by the House of Eliott. Still estranged from Jack, Bea has a new beau, debonair Sears executive Donald Bradley, who follows the ladies to England. Bea decides that she still loves Jack and settles down with him just as he is shifting from film direction to investigative journalism. Through Grace Keeble, a talented but unreliable new designer, Evie meets artists Miles Bannister and Daniel Page. Miles is hired to do illustrations for the House of Eliott and later becomes a much needed designer while Daniel is a talented artist who Evie believes only needs a break to be successful. Both men fall for Evie but Daniel wins out. Meanwhile, Madge discovers a new love and it is not her rather gruff husband Jerry. Tilly and her husband Norman struggle to keep their marriage together following the loss of their baby son, William (played by Emily Ryan). By the season end, the House of Eliott has nearly fallen apart, Bea and Jack have a daughter, Lucy (also played by Emily Ryan), Jack wins a seat in the House of Commons, and Evie has married Daniel. Miles&#x27; father becomes an investor in the House of Eliott after realising his son is a talented fashion designer. He wants the House of Eliott to make Miles a partner and to move away from &quot;haute couture&quot; and into more profitable ready-to-wear fashions. The final episode ends with a heated confrontation that raises serious questions regarding the House of Eliott&#x27;s future and the sisters&#x27; relationship.

The writers did not anticipate the programme being cancelled at the end of the third series. For this reason, the series ends without a firm conclusion to the storyline.

==Production==
&quot;The House of Eliott&quot; is usually cited as the last major BBC drama series to have the majority of its interior sequences recorded at BBC Television Centre using the multi-camera production method. By the time the series came to an end in 1994, this video production method had been abandoned for drama series (other than soap operas) in favour of shooting using the single-camera setup, either on film, or on the increasingly lightweight video cameras that were becoming available.

Some scenes were shot at Clifton Hill House and Goldney Hall university halls of residence in Bristol; while many were filmed in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. The exterior of the house is situated at 24 Berkeley Square, Bristol. Holes made by the &#x27;House of Eliott&#x27; sign still remain on the wall to the left of the front door. Colston Hall was also used.

==Cast==

Judy Campbell, Phyllis Calvert, James Cosmo, Eileen Davies, Minnie Driver, Amanda Mealing, Sheila Gish. Jessica Hynes and Phyllida Law, are among those who appeared in one or two episodes.

== DVD release ==
All three series of &quot;The House of Eliott&quot; are available on DVD for regions 1, 2 and 4 DVD and distributed by Acorn Media UK. They were released in 2004, 2006 and 2007 respectively.

== Books ==
* &quot;The House of Eliott&quot; by Jean Marsh
* &quot;The House of Eliott – A House at War&quot; by Elizabeth O&#x27;Leary (authorised)
* &quot;The House of Eliott: The Anxious Years&quot; by Edward P. Rich (fan fiction)

== Repeats ==
A series of repeats began with the first episode on 5 September 2011 on ITV3. Previously (around 2005) there were repeats of the whole series on Sky and Cable channel UK Gold.

As of April 2018, the programme is being repeated on the Drama Channel.
As of April 2024, the programme is again being repeated on Drama Channel.

== In the media ==
The show was parodied by comedy duo Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in a series of sketches called ‘The House of Idiot’. Stella Gonet, Louise Lombard and Cathy Murphy actually appear, in character, during the final sketch and comically reprimand the pair for mocking the show.

<text>Henry Knox Thatcher (26 May 1806 – 5 April 1880) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy, who served during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Thatcher was born in Thomaston, Massachusetts (after 1820 in Maine) to Ebenezer Thatcher and his wife, Lucy (daughter of Major General Henry Knox and Lucy Flucker Knox). Appointed to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1822, Thatcher was absent on sick leave for most of the first year and resigned in April 1823. He then received an appointment as a midshipman in the Navy on 4 March 1823.

Thatcher spent most of the next four years on board the frigate in the Pacific. He became a passed midshipman on 4 March 1829, and in 1830–1831 served in the schooner and sloop of war in the West Indies.

Thatcher was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1833 and served aboard the schooner in Chesapeake Bay.

Thatcher then served on the frigate in the Mediterranean Squadron in 1834–1835; had special duty in 1837; and returned to the Mediterranean in the frigate in 1840. He served aboard the receiving ship at Boston in 1843–1846, then in the sloop-of-war , part of the Africa Squadron in 1847–1850. After duty at Boston Navy Yard in 1851, he commanded the storeship in 1852.

Promoted to commander on 14 September 1855, while serving as Executive Officer of the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia, Thatcher then commanded the small sloop of war in the Pacific in 1857–1859. He was Executive Officer of the Boston Navy Yard from November 1859 to November 1861, and thus played a role in the vast expansion of the Navy that began with the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861.

===Civil War===
Thatcher was promoted to captain in 1861, and while commanding the large sloop of war in the Mediterranean, attained the rank of commodore on 3 July 1862.

Thatcher was the first commanding officer of the storeship &quot;New Hampshire&quot; upon its commissioning in May 1864. He commanded the screw frigate in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in 1864–1865, and a division of Admiral Porter&#x27;s squadron at the two battles of Fort Fisher in December 1864 and January 1865. Thatcher was then appointed to command of the Western Gulf Squadron, immediately commencing operations in cooperation with General Canby, commander of the Army of West Mississippi, in the capture of Mobile, Alabama. After a brief and vigorous bombardment, Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley were captured by the Union Army on 9 April 1865. With the key defences of the city lost, the Confederate troops evacuated Mobile on April 12. A formal surrender was demanded by General Granger and Acting-Rear Admiral Thatcher, and possession taken of the city.

On 10 May, the Confederate naval forces in the Gulf surrendered to Thatcher. Sabine Pass and Galveston, the only remaining rebel-held fortified points on the Gulf Coast, capitulated on 25 May and 2 June 1865.

===Post-war career===
Thatcher remained in command in the Gulf of Mexico until May 1866, receiving promotion to rear admiral on 25 July 1866, and commanded the North Pacific Squadron in 1867–68. There he was presented with a medal and made a Knight of the Order of Kamehameha I by King Kamehameha V of the Hawaiian Islands, an honor that he was permitted to accept by virtue of a special Act of Congress.

Though put on the retired list on 26 May 1868 when he reached the age of 62, Thatcher served as Port Admiral at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1869–1870.

By right of his descent from his grandfather, Major General Henry Knox, Thatcher was a member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. He became president of the Massachusetts Society in 1871.

Thatcher and his family settled in Winchester, Massachusetts, where he spent the remaining nine years of his life. Rear Admiral Thatcher died at his home on 5 April 1880.

<text>The growth–share matrix (also known as the product portfolio matrix, Boston Box, BCG-matrix, Boston matrix, [[Boston Consulting Group]] portfolio analysis and portfolio diagram) is a matrix used to help corporations to analyze their business units, that is, their product lines. 

The matrix was initially created in a collaborative effort by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) employees. Alan Zakon first sketched it and then, together with his colleagues, refined it. BCG&#x27;s founder Bruce D. Henderson popularized the concept in an essay titled &quot;The Product Portfolio&quot; in BCG&#x27;s publication &quot;Perspectives&quot; in 1970. The matrix helps a company to allocate resources and is used as an analytical tool in brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis. 

== Overview ==
To use the matrix, analysts plot a scatter graph to rank the business units (or products) on the basis of their relative market shares and growth rates. This results is a chart showing: 
*Cash cows, where a company has high market share in a slow-growing industry. These units typically generate cash in excess of the amount of cash needed to maintain the business. They are regarded as staid and boring, in a &quot;mature&quot; market, yet corporations value owning them due to their cash-generating qualities. They are to be &quot;milked&quot; continuously with as little investment as possible, since such investment would be wasted in an industry with low growth. Cash &quot;milked&quot; is used to fund stars and question marks, that are expected to become cash cows some time in the future.
*Dogs, also called &quot;pets&quot;: units with low market share in a mature, slow-growing industry: the BCG matrix defines dogs as having low market share and relatively low market growth rate. These units typically &quot;break even&quot;, generating barely enough cash to maintain the business&#x27;s market share. Although owning a break-even unit provides the social benefit of providing jobs and possible synergies that assist other business units, from an accounting point of view such a unit is worthless, not generating cash for the company. Dogs depress a profitable company&#x27;s return on assets ratio, a measure used by many investors to judge how well a company is being managed. Dogs, it is thought, should be sold off once short-time harvesting has been maximized.
*Question marks (also known as a problem child or Wild dogs), which are business units operating with a low market share in a high-growth market. They are a starting point for most businesses. Question marks have a potential to gain market share and become stars, and eventually cash cows when market growth slows. If question marks do not succeed in becoming a market leader, then after perhaps years of cash consumption, they will degenerate into dogs when market growth declines. When shift from question mark to star is unlikely, the BCG matrix suggests divesting the question mark and repositioning its resources more effectively in the remainder of the corporate portfolio. Question marks must be analyzed carefully in order to determine whether they are worth the investment required to grow market share.
*Stars: units with a high market share in a fast-growing industry. They are graduated &quot;question marks&quot; with a market- or niche-leading trajectory, for example: amongst market share front-runners in a high-growth sector, and/or having a monopolistic or increasingly dominant unique selling proposition with burgeoning/fortuitous proposition drive(s) from: novelty, fashion/promotion (e.g. newly prestigious celebrity-branded fragrances), customer loyalty (e.g. greenfield or military/gang enforcement backed, and/or innovative, grey-market/illicit retail of addictive drugs, for instance the British East India Company&#x27;s, late-1700s opium-based Qianlong Emperor embargo-busting, Canton System), goodwill (e.g. monopsonies) and/or gearing (e.g. oligopolies, for instance Portland cement producers near boomtowns), etc.
The hope is that stars become next cash cows. Stars require high funding to fight competitors and maintain their growth rate. When industry growth slows, if they remain a niche leader or are amongst the market leaders, stars become cash cows; otherwise, they become dogs due to low relative market share. As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either &quot;cash cows&quot; or &quot;dogs&quot;. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as &quot;question marks&quot;, then turn into &quot;stars&quot;. Eventually, the market stops growing; thus, the business unit becomes a &quot;cash cow&quot;. At the end of the cycle, the cash cow turns into a &quot;dog&quot;.

As BCG stated in 1970:
Only a diversified company with a balanced portfolio can use its strengths to truly capitalize on its growth opportunities. The balanced portfolio has:
*stars whose high share and high growth assure the future;
*cash cows that supply funds for that future growth; and
*question marks to be converted into stars with the added funds.
==Practical use==
For each product or service, the &#x27;area&#x27; of the circle represents the value of its sales. The growth–share matrix thus offers a &quot;map&quot; of the organization&#x27;s product (or service) strengths and weaknesses, at least in terms of current profitability, as well as the likely cashflows. Common spreadsheet applications can be used to generate the matrix. In addition, designated online tools are available.

The need which prompted this idea was, indeed, that of managing cash-flow. It was reasoned that one of the main indicators of cash generation was relative market share, and one which pointed to cash usage was that of market growth rate.

===Relative market share===
This indicates likely cash generation, because the higher the share the more cash will be generated. As a result of &#x27;economies of scale&#x27; (a basic assumption of the BCG Matrix), it is assumed that these earnings will grow faster the higher the share. The exact measure is the brand&#x27;s share relative to its largest competitor. Thus, if the brand had a share of 20 percent, and the largest competitor had the same, the ratio would be 1:1. If the largest competitor had a share of 60 percent, however, the ratio would be 1:3, implying that the organization&#x27;s brand was in a relatively weak position. If the largest competitor only had a share of 5 percent, the ratio would be 4:1, implying that the brand owned was in a relatively strong position, which might be reflected in profits and cash flows. If this technique is used in practice, this scale is logarithmic, not linear.

On the other hand, exactly what is a high relative share is a matter of some debate. The best evidence is that the most stable position (at least in fast-moving consumer goods markets) is for the brand leader to have a share double that of the second brand, and triple that of the third. Brand leaders in this position tend to be very stable—and profitable; the Rule of 123.

The selection of the relative market share metric was based upon its relationship to the experience curve. The market leader would have greater experience curve benefits, which delivers a cost leadership advantage.

Another reason for choosing relative market share, rather than just profits, is that it carries more information than just cash flow. It shows where the brand is positioned against its main competitors, and indicates where it might be likely to go in the future. It can also show what type of marketing activities might be expected to be effective. 

===Market growth rate===
Rapidly growing in rapidly growing markets, are what organizations strive for; but, as we have seen, the penalty is that they are usually net cash users – they require investment. The reason for this is often because the growth is being &#x27;bought&#x27; by the high investment, in the reasonable expectation that a high market share will eventually turn into a sound investment in future profits. The theory behind the matrix assumes, therefore, that a higher growth rate is indicative of accompanying demands on investment. The cut-off point is usually chosen as 10 per cent per annum. Determining this cut-off point, the rate above which the growth is deemed to be significant (and likely to lead to extra demands on cash) is a critical requirement of the technique; and one that, again, makes the use of the growth–share matrix problematical in some product areas. What is more, the evidence, from fast-moving consumer goods markets at least, is that the most typical pattern is of very low growth, less than 1 per cent per annum. This is outside the range normally considered in BCG Matrix work, which may make application of this form of analysis unworkable in many markets. 
Where it can be applied, however, the market growth rate says more about the brand position than just its cash flow. It is a good indicator of that market&#x27;s strength, of its future potential (of its &#x27;maturity&#x27; in terms of the market life-cycle), and also of its attractiveness to future competitors. It can also be used in growth analysis.

==Critical evaluation==
While theoretically useful, and widely used, several academic studies have called into question whether using the growth–share matrix actually helps businesses succeed, and the model has since been removed from some major marketing textbooks. One study (Slater and Zwirlein, 1992), which looked at 129 firms, found that those who follow portfolio planning models like the BCG matrix had lower shareholder returns.

===Misuse===
As originally practiced by the Boston Consulting Group, the matrix was used in situations where it could be applied for graphically illustrating a portfolio composition as a function of the balance between cash flows. If used with this degree of sophistication its use would still be valid. However, later practitioners have tended to over-simplify its messages. In particular, the later application of the names (problem children, stars, cash cows and dogs) has tended to overshadow all else—and is often what most students, and practitioners, remember.

Such simplistic use contains at least two major problems:

*&#x27;Minority applicability&#x27;. The cashflow techniques are only applicable to a very limited number of markets (where growth is relatively high, and a definite pattern of product life-cycles can be observed, such as that of ethical pharmaceuticals). In the majority of markets, use may give misleading results.
*&#x27;Milking cash cows&#x27;. Perhaps the worst implication of the later developments is that the (brand leader) cash cows should be milked to fund new brands. This is not what research into the fast-moving consumer goods markets has shown to be the case. The brand leader&#x27;s position is the one, above all, to be defended, not least since brands in this position will probably outperform any number of newly launched brands. Such brand leaders will, of course, generate large cash flows; but they should not be &#x27;milked&#x27; to such an extent that their position is jeopardized. In any case, the chance of the new brands achieving similar brand leadership may be slim—certainly far less than the popular perception of the Boston Matrix would imply.

Perhaps the most important danger, however, is that the apparent implication of its four-quadrant form is that there should be balance of products or services across all four quadrants; and that is, indeed, the main message that it is intended to convey. Thus, money must be diverted from &#x27;cash cows&#x27; to fund the &#x27;stars&#x27; of the future, since &#x27;cash cows&#x27; will inevitably decline to become &#x27;dogs&#x27;. There is an almost mesmeric inevitability about the whole process. It focuses attention, and funding, on to the &#x27;stars&#x27;. It presumes, and almost demands, that &#x27;cash cows&#x27; will turn into &#x27;dogs&#x27;.
The reality is that it is only the &#x27;cash cows&#x27; that are really important—all the other elements are supporting actors. It is a foolish vendor who diverts funds from a &#x27;cash cow&#x27; when these are needed to extend the life of that &#x27;product&#x27;. Although it is necessary to recognize a &#x27;dog&#x27; when it appears (at least before it bites you) it would be foolish in the extreme to create one in order to balance up the picture. The vendor, who has most of their products in the &#x27;cash cow&#x27; quadrant, should consider themselves fortunate indeed, and an excellent marketer, although they might also consider creating a few stars as an insurance policy against unexpected future developments and, perhaps, to add some extra growth. There is also a common misconception that &#x27;dogs&#x27; are a waste of resources. In many markets &#x27;dogs&#x27; can be considered loss-leaders that while not themselves profitable will lead to increased sales in other profitable areas.

===Alternatives===
As with most marketing techniques, there are a number of alternative offerings vying with the growth–share matrix although this appears to be the most widely used. The next most widely reported technique is that developed by McKinsey and General Electric, which is a three-cell by three-cell matrix—using the dimensions of &#x27;industry attractiveness&#x27; and &#x27;business strengths&#x27;. This approaches some of the same issues as the growth–share matrix but from a different direction and in a more complex way (which may be why it is used less, or is at least less widely taught). Both growth-share matrix and Industry Attractiveness-Business Strength matrix developed by McKinsey and General Electric, are criticized for being static as they portray businesses as they exist at one point in time. Business environment is subject to constant changes, hence, businesses evolve over time. The Life Cycle-Competitive Strength Matrix was introduced to overcome these deficiences and better identify &quot;developing winners&quot; or potential &quot;losers&quot;. A more practical approach is that of the Boston Consulting Group&#x27;s Advantage Matrix, which the consultancy reportedly used itself though it is little known amongst the wider population.

==Other uses==
The initial intent of the growth–share matrix was to evaluate business units, but the same evaluation can be made for product lines or any other cash-generating entities. This should only be attempted for real lines that have a sufficient history to allow some prediction; if the corporation has made only a few products and called them a product line, the sample variance will be too high for this sort of analysis to be meaningful.

<text>AGCO Corporation is an American agricultural machinery manufacturer headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, United States. It was founded in 1990. AGCO designs, produces and sells tractors, combines, foragers, hay tools, self-propelled sprayers, smart farming technologies, seeding equipment, and tillage equipment.

==History==
===1990–1996: Founding and early years===
AGCO was established on June 20, 1990, when Robert J. Ratliff, John M. Shumejda, Edward R. Swingle, and James M. Seaver, who were executives at Deutz-Allis, bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG (KHD), a German company which owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had purchased portions of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier. After the organization of the company, Robert Ratliff was selected to be the company&#x27;s first chairman.

The company was called Gleaner-Allis Corporation, then the name was changed to Allis-Gleaner Corporation, or AGCO. The Deutz-Allis line of tractors was renamed AGCO-Allis, and Gleaner became a brand of its own for combines. The Deutz-Allis brand continued in South America until 2001, when it was renamed AGCO-Allis. In 2001, AGCO Allis was renamed AGCO in North America.

In March 1991, AGCO purchased the Hesston Corporation which is in Hesston, Kansas gaining hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger, invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost. Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO purchased the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation&#x27;s White-New Idea company. In 1993, AGCO purchased the remainder of White-New Idea, a manufacturer of New Idea hay equipment, manure spreaders, and White planters with a large manufacturing plant in Coldwater, Ohio.
AGCO purchased the North American distribution rights to global agricultural equipment manufacturer Massey Ferguson in 1993 and purchased the company from Varity the following year. The acquisition of England-based Massey Ferguson gave AGCO access to markets in Europe and around the world. At the time, Massey Ferguson had 20 percent of the global market share for tractors. AGCO also purchased McConnell Tractors in 1994,&lt;ref name=&quot;AGCO-Jul-1996-S-4/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; manufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased.

In 1995 AgEquipment Group was bought; it manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion in Brazil. It was the Brazilian company which had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the &quot;Maxion&quot; brand of industrial equipment. In the same year AGCO purchased Deutz Argentina, the number one leader of tractors in Argentina. Also in 1996, AGCO purchased Western Combine Corporation and Portage Manufacturing in Canada. Western Combine had previously purchased the assets of the Massey Combine Corporation&#x27;s combine operation, which had been spun off by Massey Ferguson.

===1997–2005: Major acquisitions and growth===

In 1997 the company purchased Fendt which is based in Germany, the German tractor company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agco-Feb-1997-S-3/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of Fendt was contingent on three conditions; 1) The Fendt name would be retained, 2) The factory in Marktoberdorf would continue to operate, and 3) a fair price would be paid for the company. Also in 1997, AGCO acquired Dronningborg Industries in Denmark, the manufacturer of European Massey Ferguson combines, and former manufacturer of Dronningborg combines.

In 1998, AGCO made a joint venture with Deutz AG to produce engines in Argentina, and purchased the Spra-Coupe and Willmar companies. Spra-Coupe and Willmar are sprayer companies in North America. SpraCoupe originated in Bismarck, North Dakota. After being purchased by AGCO, the manufacturing of SpraCoupes was moved to Willmar, Minnesota where the Willmar branded fertilizer tenders and &quot;Wrangler&quot; articulated loaders were being manufactured. SpraCoupe and Willmar products were manufactured in Willmar from 1998 to 2001.

In the year 2000, AGCO bought out its partner CNH Global N.V. in the Hay and Forage Industries joint venture.

In 2001, AGCO purchased Ag-Chem Equipment, expanding its application equipment business. Ag-Chem Equipment was based in Jackson, Minnesota and developed the TerraGator flotation-type and RoGator rowcrop-type applicators. Also in 2001 the SpraCoupe and Willmar brands moved their manufacturing from Willmar, Minnesota to the Jackson facility and the &quot;Agco-Allis&quot; and &quot;White&quot; tractor lines were merged in North America under the &quot;AGCO&quot; brand, continuing in the orange color.

In 2002 AGCO purchased rights to the Challenger name and the tracked tractors from the Caterpillar Corporation, giving the firm a well-known brand name and high-power tracked tractors. The firm further developed the Challenger line into: wheeled tractors, using tractors manufactured by Iseki, Agritalia, the Massey Ferguson factory and the Brazilian Valtra factory; combines, rebranding some Massey Ferguson/Gleaner -built combines; and hay equipment, using Hesston-built hay equipment. AGCO also purchased the Sunflower Manufacturing Company in Beloit, Kansas which manufactures tillage, seeding, and specialty harvesting equipment.

In 2004 AGCO purchased the Valtra tractor company from the Kone Group, in Finland. Valtra had licensing agreements with the Eicher company in India for tractor production, and also with the HEMA group in Turkey. The purchase of Valtra also included SISU Diesel engines. Since 2012 this Finland based diesel engine manufacturer with production for example in Brazil has operated with name AGCO Power.

===2006–2020: Martin Richenhagen era===

2006 saw a re-focusing of the various brands and subsidiaries, and the reduction of individual brands. AGCO announced plans to combine some, and make some only part of a larger brand, or co-branding. Examples include the Massey Ferguson 9635 Hesston self-propelled swather, and the AGCO 9365 Hesston self-propelled swather. Challenger has seen further expansion with the further consolidation of the AgChem brand into Challenger, and the introduction of Agritalia built tractors and an articulated Challenger tractor. In August 2006, AGCO saw its first change in the position of chairman since its founding with the selection of Martin Richenhagen to succeed Robert Ratliff.

In 2007, AGCO bought 50% of Laverda S.p.A. from ARGO SpA, which included the Gallagnani and Fella-Werke hay equipment brands.

In 2008/2009 AGCO, the Challenger, Valtra, and Massey Ferguson large row crop tractors were launched in Europe and North America respectively with AGCO&#x27;s e3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission reduction technology.

Late in 2009, the firm announced that it would phase out orange AGCO tractors by 2011.

In late 2010, the firm announced the plan to acquire the remaining 50% of Laverda, which included Fella-Werke as well. The acquisition was finalized in March 2011.

In 2011, the firm plans to transfer its assembly of high-horsepower wheeled tractors sold in North America from Beauvais, France to Jackson, Minnesota, where it will expand the plant by . The expansion was completed in 2012.

In 2011, the firm said that it will invest $40 million in its Hesston, Kansas plant with a new painting and finishing building. Construction began June 2011 and was completed in 2013.

In October 2011, AGCO purchased GSI, based in Assumption, Illinois, a manufacturer of grain storage and handling equipment.

In 2012. AGCO acquired 60% of Santal Equipamentos, a sugar cane planting and harvesting equipment. It also purchased 80% of Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co, a combine harvester manufacturer in China. AGCO formed the Algerian Tractors Company joint venture with the Algerian brand Etrag with 49% ownership.

In 2013, GSI acquired Johnson System, based in Marshall, Michigan, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers. In 2013, AGCO started Fuse Technologies, a smart farming technology division.

In 2016, AGCO acquired Cimbria, based in Thisted, Denmark, a processing, handling and storage of seed and grain business. 

In 2017, AGCO acquired Precision Planting, based in Tremont, Illinois, a planting equipment and technology business.

In 2017, AGCO acquired the forage machinery line from Lely, including balers, loading wagons, mowers, tedders, rakes, and the rights to the entire portfolio of the defunct Mengele Agrartechnik. This included factories in Wolfenbuettel (D) and Waldstetten (D). The factory in Maassluis (NL) will be closed in 2018.

In September 2020, AGCO acquired 151 Research Inc., a Winnipeg, Manitoba based company that specializes in grain storage research and development.

===2021–present: Eric Hansotia era===
In 2021, AGCO named Eric Hansotia its third chairman, succeeding Richenhagen, who retired after approximately 15 years as head of the company. Hansotia has been working for AGCO since 2013 and became its chief operating officer in October 2018. Under Hansotia, AGCO made a series of acquisitions in the precision agriculture field, including: Headsight, a Bremen, Indiana-based precision harvesting company, and Farm Robotics and Automation, a Barcelona-based precision livestock agriculture firm in 2021; North Dakota-based Appareo Systems, an agriculture-focused artificial intelligence and mechatronics development firm, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, agriculture automation firm JCA Industries in 2022; the digital assets of German agricultural technology company FarmFacts in 2023; and the purchase of 85 percent of Colorado-based Trimble Inc. for 2 billion in 2024, the largest acquisition in company history. The Trimble acquisition resulted in PTx Trimble, a joint venture between the companies for autonomizing and retrofitting farm equipment.

In July 2024 AGCO announced it had reached an agreement with private equity firm American Industrial Partners to divest its Grain and Protein divisions including GSI, Automated Production, Tecno, Cimbria, and Cumberland brands.

<text>A mycoherbicide is a herbicide based on a fungus. As a biological agent, these &quot;mycoherbicides... work by producing toxic compounds that dissolve the cell walls of targeted plants&quot;. Unlike traditional herbicides, mycoherbicides can reproduce themselves and linger in the soil for many years to destroy replanted crops.

==Commercial weed control products== 
These include:
* &quot;Alter naria destruens&quot;, to control dodder
* &quot;Chondrostereum purpureum&quot;, to control &quot;Prunus&quot; &amp; &quot;Populus&quot; spp. in parts of Europe and Canada
* &quot;Colletotrichum acutatum&quot;, to control Silky hakea
* &quot;Colletotrichum gloeosporioides&quot; f. sp. &quot;aeschynomene&quot;: isolated from Northern joint vetch (&quot;Aeschynomene virginica&quot;) for rice &amp; soybeans
* &quot;Cylindrobasidium laeve&quot; to control &quot;Acacia mearnsii&quot; (black wattle) in S. Africa
* &quot;Phytophthora palmivora&quot;: isolated from strangler vine (&quot;Morrenia odorata&quot;)
* &quot;Puccinia canaliculate&quot;, to control Yellow nutsedge
* &quot;Puccinia thalaspeos&quot;, to control Dyer&#x27;s woad
* &quot;Sclerotinia minor&quot;, to control Dandelion

==Drug plants==
In the United States House of Representatives, the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (H.R. 2829) passed with the inclusion of language to initiate research into the use of mycoherbicides against drug crops in foreign countries. In particular, the U.S. is considering using &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; as a mycoherbicide against coca plants in Colombia. The United States Senate is currently drafting its own version of the bill.

<text>The Tsavo Man-Eaters were a pair of large man-eating male lions in the Tsavo region of Kenya, which were responsible for the deaths of many construction workers on the Kenya-Uganda Railway between March and December 1898. The lion pair was said to have killed dozens of people, with some early estimates reaching over a hundred deaths. While the terrors of man-eating lions were not new in the British public perception, the Tsavo Man-Eaters became one of the most notorious instances of dangers posed to Indian and native African workers of the Uganda Railway. They were eventually killed by Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, who wrote his account of his hunting experience in a semi-biography &quot;The Man-eaters of Tsavo&quot;.

Today, the Tsavo Man-Eaters are the most widely studied man-eating pantherine cats given their behavior of hunting humans as a pair and dental injuries reported in one of the lions, a cause commonly attributed to big cats turning to humans as prey.

==Historical information==
===The killings start===
As part of the construction of a railway linking Uganda with the Indian Ocean at Kilindini Harbour, in March 1898, the British started building a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. The building site consisted of several camps spread over an area of , accommodating the several thousand mostly Indian workers. The project was led by Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson, who arrived just days before the disappearances and killings began. During the next nine months of construction, two maneless male Tsavo lions stalked the campsite, dragging workers from their tents at night, devouring them. There was an interval of several months when the attacks ceased, but word trickled in from other nearby settlements of similar lion attacks. When the lions returned, the attacks intensified, with almost daily killings. Crews tried to scare off the lions and built campfires and &quot;bomas&quot;, or thorn fences made of whistling thorn trees around their camp for protection to keep the man-eaters out, all to no avail; the lions leaped over or crawled through the thorn fences to get into the camps. Patterson noted that early in their killing spree, only one lion at a time would enter the inhabited areas and seize victims, but later, they became more brazen, entering together and each seizing a victim.

As the attacks mounted, hundreds of workers fled from Tsavo, halting construction on the bridge. At this point, colonial officials began to intervene. According to Patterson, even the District Officer, Mr. Whitehead, narrowly escaped being killed by one of the lions after arriving at the Tsavo train depot in the evening. However, his assistant, Abdullah, was killed, while Whitehead escaped with four claw lacerations running down his back.

===Hunting the lions===
Eventually, other officials arrived, with a reinforcement of around twenty armed Sepoys to assist in the hunt. Patterson set traps and tried several times to ambush the lions at night from a tree. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he shot the first lion on 9 December 1898. Twenty days later, the second lion was found and killed. The first lion killed measured from nose to tip of the tail. It took eight men to carry the carcass back to camp.

Patterson wrote in his account that he wounded the first lion with one bullet from a high-caliber rifle. This shot struck the lion in its hind leg, but it escaped. Later, it returned at night and began stalking Patterson as he tried to hunt it. He shot it through the shoulder, penetrating its heart with a more powerful rifle, and found it lying dead the next morning not far from his platform.

The second lion was shot nine times, five with the same rifle, three with a second, and once with a third rifle – six finding their mark. The first shot was fired from atop a scaffolding that Patterson had built near a goat killed by the lion. Two shots from a second rifle hit the lion eleven days later as it was stalking Patterson and trying to flee. When they found the lion the next day, Patterson shot it three more times with the same rifle, severely crippling it, and shot it three times with a third rifle, twice in the chest and once in the head, which killed it. He claimed it died gnawing on a fallen tree branch, still trying to reach him.

===Works resume===
The construction crew returned and finished the bridge in February 1899. The exact number of people killed by the lions is unclear. Patterson gave several figures, overall claiming that there were 135 victims. At the end of the crisis, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Lord Salisbury, addressed the House of Lords on the subject of the Tsavo man-eaters: 

== Museum display ==
After 25 years as Patterson&#x27;s floor rugs, the lions&#x27; skins were sold to the Field Museum of Natural History in 1924 for $5,000. The skins arrived at the museum in very poor condition. The lions were reconstructed and are now on permanent display, along with their skulls.

== Modern research ==

In 2001, a review of causes for man-eating behaviour among lions revealed that the proposed human toll of 100 or more was most likely an exaggeration and that the more likely death toll was 28–31 victims. This reduced total was based on their review of Colonel Patterson&#x27;s original journal, courtesy of Alan Patterson. However, the same study also noted that the journal refers only to Indian workers and that Patterson stated that the casualties were much higher in the African worker population but that those numbers were not documented.

The two lion specimens in Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum are known as FMNH 23970, the &#x27;standing&#x27; mount, killed on 9 December 1898, and FMNH 23969, the &#x27;crouching&#x27; mount, killed on 29 December 1898. Recent studies on the isotopic signature analysis of Δ13C and Nitrogen-15 in their bone collagen and hair keratin were published in 2009. Using realistic assumptions on the consumable tissue per victim, lion energetic needs, and their assimilation efficiencies, researchers compared the man-eaters&#x27; Δ13C signatures to various reference standards: Tsavo lions with normal (wildlife) diets, grazers, and browsers from Tsavo East and Tsavo West, and the skeletal remains of Taita people from the early 20th century. Interpolation of their estimates across the nine months of recorded man-eating behavior suggested that FMNH 23969 most likely ate the equivalent of 10.5 humans and that FMNH 23970 most likely ate 24.2 humans. However, the researchers noted that, according to their estimates, a combined death toll as high as 72 was still possible. 

DNA from compacted hair found in the tooth cavities of the Tsavo man-eaters in 2024 reveals that in addition to humans, the lions fed on zebras, oryx, waterbuck, wildebeest, and at least two individuals of Masai giraffe. This suggests the lions would switch between hunting their natural prey and humans, though it remains unclear as to whether the lions began hunting humans as a result of the injuries sustained to the male with the damaged tooth.

The scientific analysis does not differentiate between the entire human corpses consumed and the parts of individual prey since the attacks often raise alarms, forcing the lions to slink back into the surrounding area. Many workers over the long construction period went missing, died in accidents, or fled out of fear, so it is likely almost all of the builders who stayed on knew someone missing or supposedly eaten. It appears that Colonel Patterson may have exaggerated his claims, as have subsequent investigators (e.g., &quot;135 armed men&quot;, Neiburger and Patterson, 2000), though none of these modern studies have taken into account the people who were killed but not eaten by the animals. Other researchers have also shown that estimates of animal diets derived from isotopic models often deviate considerably from the correct values.

== Possible causes of &quot;man-eating&quot; behavior ==
Theories for the man-eating behaviour of lions have been reviewed by Peterhans and Gnoske, as well as Bruce D. Patterson (2004). Their discussions include the following: 
*An outbreak of rinderpest (cattle plague) in 1898 (see 1890s African rinderpest epizootic) devastated the lions&#x27; usual prey, forcing them to find alternative food sources.
*The Tsavo lions may have been accustomed to finding dead humans at the Tsavo River crossing. Slave caravans to the center of the East African slave trade, Zanzibar, routinely crossed the river there.

An alternative argument indicates that the first lion had a severely damaged tooth that would have compromised its ability to kill natural prey. However, the general public has generally disregarded this theory. Colonel Patterson, who killed the lions, disclaimed it, saying that he damaged that tooth with his rifle while the lion charged him one night, prompting it to flee. 

Studies indicate that the lions ate humans as a supplement to other food, as a last resort. Eating humans was probably an alternative to hunting or scavenging due to dental disease and/or a limited number of prey.

A 2017 study by Bruce Patterson found that one of the lions had an infection at the root of his canine tooth, making it hard for that particular lion to hunt. Lions typically use their jaws to grab prey like zebras and wildebeests and suffocate them.

== Popular culture ==
=== In film ===
Patterson&#x27;s book was the basis for several films: 
* &quot;Men Against the Sun&quot; (1952) – shot on location in Kenya
* &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Killers of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1959)
* &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (1996), with Val Kilmer playing John Henry Patterson
* &quot;Prey&quot; (South Africa, 2007)

<doc id="1132360" wikidata="Q1972207" url="?curid=1132360" title="Albert Bridge, London">
<text>Albert Bridge is a road bridge over the River Thames connecting Chelsea in Central London on the north bank to Battersea on the south. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, it proved to be structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council (GLC) added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.

Built as a toll bridge, it was commercially unsuccessful. Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were lifted. The tollbooths remained in place and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London. Nicknamed &quot;The Trembling Lady&quot; because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it, the bridge has signs at its entrances that warn troops to break step whilst crossing the bridge.

Incorporating a roadway only wide, and with serious structural weaknesses, the bridge was ill-equipped to cope with the advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century. Despite many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation, Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs. It is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced (the other is Tower Bridge). The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the GLC did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge&#x27;s structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life. As a result, it is the second-least busy Thames road bridge in London; only Southwark Bridge carries less traffic.

In 1992, Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it more conspicuous in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships. At night it is illuminated by 4,000 LEDs, adding to its status as a landmark.

==History==

The historic industrial town of Chelsea on the north bank of the River Thames about west of Westminster, and the rich farming village of Battersea, facing Chelsea on the south bank, were linked by the modest wooden Battersea Bridge in 1771. In 1842 the Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues recommended the construction of an embankment at Chelsea to free land for development, and proposed a new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge, and the replacement of the latter by a more modern structure. Work on the Victoria Bridge (later renamed Chelsea Bridge), a short distance downstream of Battersea Bridge, began in 1851 and was completed in 1858, with work on the Chelsea Embankment beginning in 1862. Meanwhile, the proposal to demolish Battersea Bridge was abandoned.

The wooden Battersea Bridge had become dilapidated by the mid-19th century. It had grown unpopular and was considered unsafe. The newer Victoria Bridge, meanwhile, suffered severe congestion. In 1860, Prince Albert suggested that a new tollbridge built between the two existing bridges would be profitable, and in the early 1860s, the Albert Bridge Company was formed with the aim of building this new crossing. A proposal put forward in 1863 was blocked by strong opposition from the operators of Battersea Bridge, which was less than from the proposed site of the new bridge and whose owners were consequently concerned over potential loss of custom. A compromise was reached, and in 1864 a new act of Parliament was passed, authorising the new bridge on condition that it was completed within five years. The act compelled the Albert Bridge Company to purchase Battersea Bridge once the new bridge opened, and to compensate its owners by paying them £3,000 per annum (about £ in 2025) in the interim.

Rowland Mason Ordish was appointed to design the new bridge. Ordish was a leading architectural engineer who had worked on the Royal Albert Hall, St Pancras railway station, the Crystal Palace and Holborn Viaduct. The bridge was built using the Ordish–Lefeuvre system, an early form of cable-stayed bridge design that Ordish had patented in 1858. Ordish&#x27;s design resembled a conventional suspension bridge in employing a parabolic cable to support the centre of the bridge, but differed in its use of 32 inclined stays to support the remainder of the load. Each stay consisted of a flat wrought iron bar attached to the bridge deck, and a wire rope composed of 1,000 diameter wires joining the wrought iron bar to one of the four octagonal support columns.

==Construction==
Although authorised in 1864, work on the bridge was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea Embankment, for the bridge&#x27;s design could not be completed until the exact layout of the new roads being built on the north bank of the river had been agreed. Whilst plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge.

In 1869, the time allowed by the 1864 act to build the bridge expired. Delays caused by the Chelsea Embankment project meant that work on the bridge had not even begun, and a new act of Parliament was required to extend the time limit. Construction finally got underway in 1870, and it was anticipated that the bridge would be completed in about a year, at a cost of £70,000 (about £ in 2025). In the event, the project ran for over three years, and the final bill came to £200,000 (about £ in 2025). It was intended to open the bridge and the Chelsea Embankment in a joint ceremony in 1874, but the Albert Bridge Company was keen to start recouping the substantially higher-than-expected costs, and the bridge opened without any formal ceremony on 23 August 1873, almost ten years after its authorisation. As the law demanded, the Albert Bridge Company then bought Battersea Bridge.

Ordish&#x27;s bridge was wide and long, with a central span. The deck was supported by 32 rigid steel rods suspended from four octagonal cast iron towers, with the towers resting on cast iron piers. The four piers were cast at Battersea and floated down the river into position, at which time they were filled with concrete; at the time they were the largest castings ever made. Unlike most other suspension bridges of the time, the towers were positioned outside the bridge to avoid causing any obstruction to the roadway. At each entrance was a pair of tollbooths with a bar between them, to prevent people entering the bridge without paying.

The bridge acquired the nickname of &quot;The Trembling Lady&quot; because of its tendency to vibrate, particularly when used by troops from the nearby Chelsea Barracks. Concerns about the risks of mechanical resonance effects on suspension bridges, following the 1831 collapse of the Broughton Suspension Bridge and the 1850 collapse of Angers Bridge, led to notices being placed at the entrances warning troops to break step (i.e. not to march in rhythm) when crossing the bridge; Although the barracks closed in 2008, the warning signs are still in place.

==Transfer to public ownership==

Albert Bridge was catastrophically unsuccessful financially. By the time the new bridge opened, the Albert Bridge Company had been paying compensation to the Battersea Bridge Company for nine years, and on completion of the new bridge became liable for the costs of repairing the by then dilapidated and dangerous structure. The cost of subsidising Battersea Bridge drained funds intended for the building of wide approach roads, making the bridge difficult to reach. It was located slightly further from central London than neighbouring Victoria (Chelsea) Bridge, and demand for the new bridge was less than expected. In the first nine months of its operation £2,085 (about £ in 2025) were taken in tolls.

The Metropolis Toll Bridges Act 1877 (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. xcix) was passed, which allowed the Metropolitan Board of Works to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith and Waterloo bridges and free them from tolls. In 1879, Albert Bridge, which had cost £200,000 to build, was bought by the Board of Works along with Battersea Bridge for a combined price of £170,000 (about £ in 2025). The tolls were removed from both bridges on 24 May 1879, but the octagonal tollbooths were left in place, and today are the only surviving bridge tollbooths in London.

==Structural weaknesses==
In 1884 the Board of Works&#x27; Chief Engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette conducted an inspection of the bridge and found that the iron rods were already showing serious signs of corrosion. Over the next three years the staying rods were augmented with steel chains, giving it an appearance more closely resembling a conventional suspension bridge, and a new timber deck was laid, at a total cost of £25,000 (about £ in 2025). Despite these improvements Bazalgette was still concerned about its structural integrity, and a weight limit of five tons was imposed on vehicles using the bridge.

With a roadway only wide and subject to weight restrictions from early on, Albert Bridge was ill-suited to the advent of motorised transport in the 20th century. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic recommended demolition and rebuilding of the bridge to carry four lanes of traffic, but the plan was not carried out because of a shortage of funds in the Great Depression. It continued to deteriorate, and in 1935 the weight limit was reduced to two tons.

Because of its ongoing structural weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed replacing Albert Bridge with a more conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in the withdrawal of the proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge&#x27;s condition continued to deteriorate, however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.

===Pedestrianised park proposal===

The GLC&#x27;s solution entailed adding two concrete piers in the middle of the river to support the central span and thus transform the bridge&#x27;s central section into a beam bridge. The bridge&#x27;s main girder was also strengthened, and a lightweight replacement deck was laid. The modifications were intended to be a stopgap measure to extend the bridge&#x27;s life by five years while a replacement was being considered; in the GLC&#x27;s estimation the work would last for a maximum of 30 years, but the bridge would need to be either closed or replaced well before then.

In early 1973, the &quot;Architectural Review&quot; submitted a proposal to convert Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area&#x27;s residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000 signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention to proceed with the &quot;Architectural Review&quot; scheme once legal matters had been dealt with.

The Royal Automobile Club campaigned vigorously against the pedestrianisation proposal. A publicity campaign fronted by actress Diana Dors in favour of reopening the bridge was launched, whilst a lobbying group of local residents led by poet Robert Graves campaigned in support of the GLC&#x27;s plan. Graves&#x27;s campaign collected over a thousand signatures in support, but was vigorously attacked by the British Road Federation, who derided the apparent evidence of public support for the scheme as &quot;sending a lot of students around to council flats [where] most people will sign anything without knowing what it is all about&quot;. A public inquiry of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid congestion on neighbouring bridges, and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and two-ton weight limit in place.

==Present day==

In 1990, the tidal flow system was abandoned and Albert Bridge was converted back to two-way traffic. A traffic island was installed on the south end of the bridge to prevent larger vehicles from using it. In the early years of the 21st century the Chelsea area experienced a growth in the popularity of large four-wheel drive cars (so-called Chelsea tractors), many of which were over the two-ton weight limit; it was estimated that one third of all vehicles using the bridge were over the weight limit. In July 2006 the wide roadway was narrowed to a single lane in each direction to reduce the load. Red-and-white plastic barriers have been erected along the roadway in an effort to protect the structure from damage by cars.

Between 1905 and 1981, Albert Bridge was painted uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. This has added to its status as a London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to increase visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminated the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation.

Except for Tower Bridge, built in 1894, Albert Bridge is the only Thames road bridge in central London never to have been replaced. Intended as a temporary measure to be removed in 1978, the concrete central piers remain in place, and although in 1974 its lifespan was estimated at a maximum of 30 years, the bridge is still standing and operational. The Albert Bridge was protected as a Grade II* listed structure in 1975, granting it protection against significant alteration without consultation. It continues to deteriorate. Although proposals have been drawn up by Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council to repair and rescue it, by March 2008 funds for the repairs were unavailable. As well as structural damage caused by traffic, the timbers underpinning the deck were being seriously rotted by the urine of dogs crossing to and from nearby Battersea Park. With multiple measures in place to reduce traffic flow and prolong the life of the bridge, in 2009 it carried approximately 19,000 vehicles per day, the lowest usage of any Thames road bridge in London other than the little-used Southwark Bridge.

===Refurbishment of 2010–2011===
The bridge was closed to motor vehicles on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after the condition of the bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timbers in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million, of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25%, the other 75% being provided by Transport for London.

It re-opened on 2 December 2011, when two dogs named Prince and Albert, from nearby Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, walked across the bridge to open it officially. All of the Grade II features were retained.

==In popular culture==
Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;, &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; and &quot;Flack&quot;. It is also at the centre of a song by The Pogues, &quot;Misty Morning, Albert Bridge&quot; from their &quot;Peace and Love&quot; album (1989). The bridge appears in the Doctor Who story ‘Logopolis’ where the mysterious Watcher beckons the soon to regenerate fourth Doctor from the pier below.The bridge appears on the cover of the Thomas Leer and Robert Rental album &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1979).

<text>The Bell 222 is an American twin-engine light helicopter built by Bell Helicopter. The Bell 230 is an improved development with different engines and other minor changes.

==Development==

===Origins===
In the late 1960s, Bell began designing a new twin-turbine engine light helicopter. A mockup of the new helicopter was displayed in January 1974 at a helicopter convention. Following interest at the convention, the company announced the new &quot;Bell 222&quot;. It was the first light commercial twin-turbine helicopter developed in the United States.

The Bell 222 incorporated a number of advanced features, including dual hydraulic and electrical systems, sponsons housing the retractable landing gear, and the Noda Matic vibration reduction system developed for the Bell 214ST.

Manufacturing began in 1975. The Model 222 first flew on August 13, 1976. It received certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on August 16, 1979, and was approved for visual flight rules (VFR) use on December 20, 1979. Helicopter deliveries began on January 16, 1980. The FAA approved the 222 for single-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR) operation on May 15, 1980.

===Improved versions===
The more powerful &quot;Bell 222B&quot; was introduced in 1982 with a larger diameter main rotor. The 222B-based &quot;Bell 222UT&quot; Utility Twin, with skid landing gear, was introduced in 1983.

A development of the 222 is the &quot;Bell 230&quot;, with the 222&#x27;s LTS 101 engines replaced by two Allison 250 turboshaft engines, plus other refinements. A converted 222 first flew as the prototype 230 on August 12, 1991. Transport Canada awarded certification in March 1992, and the first production 230 was delivered that November. The 230 had optional skid or wheel undercarriage. Production ended in 1995 with 38 having been built, being replaced in Bell&#x27;s lineup by the stretched, more powerful Bell 430.

==Design==
The design includes two main rotor blades of stainless-steel-fiberglass construction and rotor hub with elastomeric bearings, which are lubricant free. Its cabin holds a maximum of ten persons with one-two pilots and eight to nine passengers. Seating configurations include standard seating for a pilot and seven passengers; or executive seating with one to two pilots and seating for five to six. The Bell 222 and 230 are usually flown single-pilot (optional dual controls are available), and can be configured for corporate/executive, EMS or utility transport missions.

The Bell 222 is powered by twin Lycoming/Honeywell LTS101-650 turboshaft engines, rated at 592 shp each. Later 222 versions feature more powerful engines. Engine output is at 100% of rating at 9598 RPM. Two independent driveshafts deliver power from the engines to the transmission. The Bell 222&#x27;s LTS101 engine exhaust stacks are located at the rear of the engines, while the 230&#x27;s Allison engine exhaust stacks are located high on the cowling. Fuel is stored in three tanks, one in the fuselage and one in each sponson. The main rear landing gear retracts into the sponsons.

The Bell 222&#x27;s rotor systems include:
* Two-blade, semi-rigid high-kinetic energy main rotor with preconing and underslinging. The rotor head incorporates elastomeric bearings for hub springs, and flapping and pitch change bearings. The system is similar in design to that used by the AH-1 Cobra. Rotor speed at 100% engine speed is 348 RPM.
* All series models incorporate a pusher-type two-bladed tail rotor mounted on the left side of the tailboom, turning at 3396 RPM.

==Variants==
;Bell 222: The original Model 222, sometimes unofficially called a &quot;Bell 222A&quot; to distinguish it from the Bell 222B. It was powered by two (618 hp takeoff rated, 591 hp max continuous rated) Honeywell (formerly Lycoming) LTS101-650C-3 turboshafts.
;Bell 222B: In 1982 the 222 was given a power upgrade (two Honeywell (formerly Lycoming) LTS101-750Cs with takeoff rating of 680 hp each), a larger main rotor, and was renamed the Bell 222B.
;Bell 222B Executive: This model had improved systems and a luxury interior.

;Bell 222UT: A 222B variant with skids, introduced in 1983. The lack of retractable landing gear allowed for larger auxiliary fuel tanks.

;Bell D-292: The Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP) was a 1985 all-composite LHX proof-of-concept project. The Bell D-292 used the Avco Lycoming engines, transmission, two-bladed main and tail rotors, tailboom, vertical fin, and rotor pylon of the 222. The D-292 had a new composite airframe.

;Bell 230: In 1991, the 222B design was updated, given more uprated engines, and renamed the Bell 230. Production ended in 1995.
;Bell 230 Executive: Executive transport version.
;Bell 230 Utility: Utility transport version.
;Bell 230 EMS: Air ambulance version, equipped with one or two stretchers.

;Bell 222SP: During the 1990s, some Bell 222s were modified with the 222B&#x27;s engines and 230&#x27;s Allison 250-C30G engines for improved single engine (engine-out) performance, and redesignated as 222SPs.

;Bell 430: In 1995 the Bell 430, a stretched 230 (adding another seating row), was launched, with uprated engines and a four-blade main rotor.

==Operators==

The Bell 222 has seen service with a large number of civil operators, but only limited military service.
*Albtransport (crashed in 2006)
*Chilean Navy

<text>Melittin is the main component (40–60% of the dry weight) and the major pain-producing substance of honeybee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) venom. Melittin is a basic peptide consisting of 26 amino acids.

== Function ==

The principal function of melittin as a component of bee venom is to cause pain and destruction of tissue of intruders that threaten a beehive. However, in honey bees, melittin is not only expressed in the venom gland, but also in other tissues when infected with pathogens. The two venom molecules, melittin and secapin, that are over-expressed in honey bees infected with various pathogens, possibly indicate a role for melittin in the immune response of bees to infectious diseases.

== Structure ==

Melittin is a small peptide with no disulfide bridge; the &quot;N&quot;-terminal part of the molecule is predominantly hydrophobic and the &quot;C&quot;-terminal part is hydrophilic and strongly basic. In water, it forms a tetramer but it also can spontaneously integrate itself into cell membranes.

== Mechanism of action ==

Injection of melittin into animals and humans causes pain sensation. It has strong surface effects on cell membranes causing pore-formation in epithelial cells and the destruction of red blood cells. Melittin also activates nociceptor (pain receptor) cells through a variety of mechanisms.

Melittin can open thermal nociceptor TRPV1 channels via cyclooxygenase metabolites resulting in depolarization of nociceptor cells. The pore forming effects in cells causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It also activates G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated opening of transient receptor potential channels. Finally melittin up-regulates the expression of Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 sodium channels in nociceptor cell causing long term action potential firing and pain sensation.

Melittin inhibits protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, myosin light chain kinase, and Na+/K+-ATPase (synaptosomal membrane). Melittin blocks transport pumps such as the Na+-K+-ATPase and the H+-K+-ATPase.

==Toxicity of a bee sting==

Melittin is the main compound in bee venom, accounting for the potential lethality of a bee sting, which causes an anaphylactic reaction in some people. At the sites of multiple stings, localized pain, swelling, and skin redness occur, and if bees are swallowed, life-threatening swelling of the throat and respiratory passages may develop.

==Use ==

Bee venom therapy has been used in traditional medicine for treating various disorders, although its non-specific toxicity has limited scientific research on its potential effects.

<doc id="1132373" wikidata="Q16950035" url="?curid=1132373" title="Skittish">
<text>Skittish is an album released in 2000 by Mike Doughty, founder of the alternative rock band Soul Coughing, and is his first solo effort. It was recorded in a single day, on July 5 1996, with indie rock producer Kramer and mixed the following day. A number of the songs on the album had been intended as Soul Coughing songs, but were rejected by other band members for the album &quot;Irresistible Bliss&quot;. The CD was first released with a limited run of 200, which was signed by the artist and contained a written “Fake Word” on the track list. This limited CD was an online purchase directly from Mike Doughty.

Though Kramer developed some of the songs in Doughty&#x27;s absence, with strings and organ, the disc is mostly a stark affair. Doughty&#x27;s riffs—often using a guitar rhythm Doughty calls the &quot;gangadank&quot;—punctuate emotional lyrics on songs such as &quot;The Only Answer&quot; and &quot;The Pink Life&quot;. However, Soul Coughing&#x27;s label Warner Bros. chose to reject the songs, due to the fact that they sounded radically different to those created by Soul Coughing.

The album was not officially released, but different versions of the tracks, which sometimes included extra instruments as experimental mixes, were made available on Napster as The Skittish Sessions. Following Doughty&#x27;s departure from Soul Coughing in 2000, he began touring solo and was surprised to discover that audiences were already familiar with the songs. As a result, he decided to produce white label versions of the CD himself and sell them at gigs, managing to sell 20,000 copies, mostly by hand at the front of the stage after shows.

&quot;Skittish&quot; finally got an official release in 2004 as part of the double album &quot;Skittish / Rockity Roll&quot;, which also includes Doughty&#x27;s electro EP &quot;Rockity Roll&quot;.

<doc id="1132380" wikidata="Q14716157" url="?curid=1132380" title="International Academy">
<text>The International Academy (IA) is a public, magnet high school with its main campus located in Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan, with additional campuses in White Lake Township, Michigan and Troy, Michigan.

Students are required to earn both high school and International Baccalaureate (IB) diplomas. In 2020, according to IA, 92% of the graduates earned IB diplomas, compared to the world average of 79%.

== Foundation==
The school was founded at the initiative of Lambert Okma, who proposed it to the Bloomfield Hills School District in 1992. Okma previously taught economics at Bloomfield Hills Lahser High School. While teaching at Lahser, Okma attended a series of seminars with the educational outreach coordinator of The Federal Reserve Bank of Detroit, where they discussed how they felt that there was a necessity for education to respond to rapidly increasing globalization. Their response was to propose &quot;a high school with an emphasis on developing skills and personal attributes needed to succeed in the international arena, using the international baccalaureate as its core.&quot;

International Academy opened in August 1996 with Okma as principal, and the school had its first graduates in May 2000. The Okma campus is officially hosted by the Bloomfield Hills School District, and the campuses collectively are managed by a consortium consisting of the Avondale, Berkley, Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills, Clawson, Huron Valley, Lake Orion, Rochester, Royal Oak, South Lyon, Troy, Waterford, and West Bloomfield school districts.

Okma retired from his position as principal at the end of the 2008-09 year, though he continues to work as an IB consultant for other districts.

==Recognition==

IA was recognized by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine as the top public school in the nation in 2003, second in 2004, second in 2005, ninth in 2006, seventh in 2007, twelfth in 2008, second in 2009, 25th in 2010, 20th in 2011, 5th in 2012, 18th in 2013, 9th in 2014, and 8th in 2015. &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s standings were based on the number of IB (International Baccalaureate) or AP (Advanced Placement) tests that the school averaged per graduating senior. The IA&#x27;s high rankings are due to the full diploma program being required of all students, meaning they each sit for at least 6 IB exams in May of their senior year. Each senior therefore takes at least six IB tests (in addition to the Theory of Knowledge course; Creativity, Action, &amp; Service hours; and Extended Essay requirements), giving the school a high average number of IB tests.

IA was recognized by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as the second-best public high school in the nation in December 2009. Again earning this #2 ranking in 2011. In 2014, IA dropped down to 9th ranking. In 2016, IA was once again ranked 9th. The U.S. news used &quot;quality-adjusted tests per student&quot; as the criteria. The International Academy was also named the best public IB program in the country, with an &quot;IB Diploma per Grade 12 student enrolled&quot; rate of 90.4%. In 2021, IA ranked No. 43 in the United States and No. 3 in Michigan among public high schools according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

According to IA, the Class of 2018 average SAT scores were 659 for Evidence-based Reading and Writing, and 721 for Math. The average ACT composite score was a 29.7. In addition, 57 members (16%) of the Class of 2018 were named National Merit Scholars, 30 of whom were Finalists.

==Student life==
Students are selected by lottery among the applicants. In 2004, the school enrollment was 576. International Academy has an extended school year (205 days) and an extended school day. At the end of the school day, many students stay to participate in after-school clubs, extra classes (jazz band or full orchestra), or meet with teachers and friends. Students may also participate in activities at their home schools. Students typically only participate in activities at their home high schools that the International Academy does not offer, including sports teams and marching bands.

===Internationalism===
The IA often classifies itself as an international school, and has a number of international students - about 10 to 15 percent of the student body attended a school overseas before coming to the IA. However, their families must move to one of the sending districts before coming to the IA. The IA does not have boarding students. The IA gives preference to international students (classified as students who have lived in the US for less than one year), as well as students coming from other IB schools (in the United States or elsewhere). The Central and East campuses have particularly large Asian-American populations (mainly from China, Korea, the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East).

===Athletics===
The International Academy has no school-sponsored sports. When the IA was founded in 1996, it agreed not to sponsor sports teams when sending districts voiced concern that they would lose athletes to the IA. Students who wish to participate in sports or marching band must do so through their sending district. About one-third of the students participate in competitive sports or other activities through their home high schools.

The IA is allowed to have athletic teams which compete against other schools so long as they are completely student-run, with no funding from the school. In the past, students have started their own competitive teams, including a series of soccer teams, an Ultimate Frisbee club, and a competitive boys&#x27; basketball team. There are also school-funded intramural tournaments, such as a Paintball tournament and the annual IA Olympics, which consists of various competitive events, including athletic events, between the different grades at each campus. Currently, the primary student-led sports are run by The Table Tennis Association, The International Academy Cricket Association, and The Ultimate Frisbee Club.

==Facilities==
The International Academy&#x27;s Central Campus, the Okma Campus, is located in Bloomfield Township, Michigan in Metro Detroit, near Bloomfield Hills.

It is housed in the former site of Elizabeth Taylor Traub Elementary School. International Academy&#x27;s Okma Campus building used to host Kensington Academy, a Catholic school.

Districts which send students to the Central Campus include Avondale, Bloomfield Hills, Berkley, Birmingham, Clawson, Lake Orion, Rochester, Royal Oak, Walled Lake, Waterford and West Bloomfield. The Farmington and Oxford districts have recently chosen to leave the IA consortium in order to start their own IB programs.

===West Campus===
The West campus was the first satellite campus of the International Academy. A satellite campus had been considered as early as 2003. This school first held classes in August 2006, and its first graduating class was the Class of 2010. The IA West campus is located inside Lakeland High School of Huron Valley Schools. The sending districts include Huron Valley and South Lyon. Their experience is similar to that of students on the Central Campus, with the exception of fewer options in foreign language (Spanish and French only). Like at the Central Campus, students play sports through their sending districts. Huron Valley Schools has opened up 10 spots for students in districts outside the International Academy consortium, including students living outside of Oakland County, for the Class of 2011 onward. Though initially successful, the West campus has seen its number of consortium districts dwindle as a result of district budget cuts and more districts (such as Fenton) opting to start their own IB programs rather than send students to the IA.

===East Campus===
IA has set up an Eastern campus in Troy, in the former Baker Middle School building. Classes were first held in the 2008-2009 school year. Like the other two campuses, the school began with one freshman class and has added another each year. The first graduating class graduated in 2012. This campus includes students from the Troy School District as well as school-of-choice students from other districts. Troy students through the Class of 2011 attended the Central campus. The Eastern campus&#x27;s student body is about the same size as the Central campus, and students have access to the same classes as students at the Central campus, save for German, which was not added to the curriculum as the first incoming freshman class did not have a sufficient number of people who were interested in the course. The Eastern campus offers the same fine arts options as the Central campus.

<doc id="1132395" wikidata="Q1753107" url="?curid=1132395" title="Trilogy (Yngwie Malmsteen album)">
<text>Trilogy is the third studio album by guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, released in October 1986 through Polydor Records. The album reached No. 44 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and charted within the top 60 in the Netherlands and Sweden. 

==Background==
&quot;Trilogy&quot; is the first studio album by Malmsteen to feature lead singer Mark Boals, who briefly replaced Jeff Scott Soto after his departure from Malmsteen&#x27;s band in 1985. However, Soto was again the lead singer during the album&#x27;s supporting tour between 1986 and 1987, before joining the band Kryst the Conqueror.

In the liner notes, Malmsteen dedicates the album to the memory of the late Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was assassinated on 28 February 1986.

==Critical reception==

Steve Huey at AllMusic gave &quot;Trilogy&quot; four stars out of five, calling it Malmsteen&#x27;s second best album after his 1984 debut &quot;Rising Force&quot;. Malmsteen&#x27;s compositional and lyrical skills were described as being at their peak on &quot;Trilogy&quot;, while his guitar work was praised as &quot;jaw-droppingly fast and technically demanding&quot;. Huey listed &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Remember, I&#x27;ll Never Forget&quot; and &quot;Trilogy Suite Op: 5&quot; as highlights.

&quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included the album cover on their list of &quot;50 most hilariously ugly rock and metal album covers ever&quot;.

<doc id="1132416" wikidata="Q2719092" url="?curid=1132416" title="Porte-cochère">
<text>A porte-cochère (; ; ; ) is a doorway to a building or courtyard, &quot;often very grand,&quot; through which vehicles can enter from the street or a covered porch-like structure at a main or secondary entrance to a building through which originally a horse and carriage and today a motor vehicle can pass to provide arriving and departing occupants protection from the elements.

Portes-cochères are still found on such structures as major public buildings and hotels, providing covered access for visitors and guests arriving by motorized transport.

A porte-cochère, a structure for vehicle passage, is to be distinguished from a portico, a columned porch or entry for human, rather than vehicular, traffic.

== History ==
The porte-cochère was a feature of many late 18th- and 19th-century mansions and public buildings. A well-known example is at Buckingham Palace in London. A portico at the White House in Washington, D.C. is often confused with a porte-cochère, where a raised vehicle ramp gives an architectural portico the functionality of the latter.

Today portes-cochères are found at both elaborate private homes and such public buildings as churches, hotels, health facilities, and schools. Portes-cochère differ from carports in that the vehicles pass through for passengers to board or exit rather than being parked beneath the covered area.

Guard stones are often found at the foot of portes-cochère, acting as protective bollards to prevent vehicles from damaging the structure.

<doc id="1132421" wikidata="Q526233" url="?curid=1132421" title="Dmitri Alenichev">
<text>Dmitri Anatolyevich Alenichev (; born 20 October 1972) is a Russian football coach, former player and politician.

==Club career==
Despite being a Spartak Moscow fan, Alenichev debuted 1991 for Moscow rivals Lokomotiv Moscow, where he played four years before moving to Spartak, where in five years he won three Russian leagues and two cups, and was also elected Russian player of the year in 1997. Won Malta International Football Tournament 1996. On 14 June 1998 Italian Serie A side Roma officially agreed with Spartak for 7 million USD and the player moved to Rome. He played 21 matches in his first season, but after only seven matches in the second season, he moved to Perugia in December 1999. His stint in Italy overall proved to be unsuccessful and he was eventually considered to be one of Italian football&#x27;s biggest foreign flops.

In 2000, he moved to Portuguese Primeira Liga side Porto, where he made a strong first impression, scored the equalizing goal against rivals Sporting CP in the first leg of the 2000 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. He was also impressive overall in first season, as Porto captured the Taça de Portugal after winning the final 2–0 against Marítimo, Alenichev scoring the second goal. The following season, Alenichev suffered some animosity from new Porto head coach Octávio Machado (similar to his compatriot Sergei Ovchinnikov) and spent most of the first half of the season sidelined, under the shadow of Deco. When Octávio was sacked and replaced with José Mourinho, Alenichev&#x27;s prospects changed. Although he was not a regular in the starting 11, he was usually the first player substituted onto the pitch, particularly when Mourinho shifted from a 4–3–3 to a 4–4–2 formation. A starting player in the 2003 UEFA Cup Final and mid-match substitute in the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, Alenichev scored in both contests, the only Russian player to do so as of 2023. In the former, against Celtic, he scored the second goal, following a pass from Deco; and in the latter, against Monaco, he closed the scoreline with a powerful volley shot following a deflected through cross from Derlei. This made him one of only three players to score goals in two consecutive cup finals of different European competitions, the others being Ronald Koeman and Ronaldo.

During UEFA Euro 2004, in which Alenichev played in all three of Russia&#x27;s matchups, he announced his desire to return to Spartak Moscow. In appreciation for the services done for the club, the FC Porto board made no objections to the transfer.

On 8 April 2006, &quot;Sport-Express&quot; published Alenichev&#x27;s interview containing severe criticism of Aleksandrs Starkovs, Spartak&#x27;s head coach at the time. Following that, Alenichev was fined, dismissed from the first team, transfer listed 14 April and on 10 September his contract was finally terminated by mutual agreement. This marked the end of his playing career.

==Managerial career==
In 2011, he joined FC Arsenal Tula as a manager and led the club through three promotions in 3 seasons from fourth-level Russian Amateur Football League to the top-level Russian Premier League. Arsenal was relegated after just one season in the top tier and Alenichev left.

In June 2015, he became manager of his former club Spartak Moscow. He resigned as Spartak manager on 5 August 2016 following Spartak&#x27;s elimination in the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round by AEK Larnaca. At the end of that season, Spartak won the Russian Premier League for the first time in 16 years under the management of his assistant Massimo Carrera.

On 5 June 2017, Alenichev signed a two-year contract with Russian second division club Yenisey Krasnoyarsk. In his first season, he led Yenisey to promotion to the Russian Premier League for the first time in club&#x27;s history. He was replaced as Yenisey coach after the club was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2018–19 season.

==Style of play==
A technically gifted and offensive-minded midfielder, Alenichev&#x27;s favoured role was as a number 10 behind the strikers; he was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion throughout his career, although he lacked both the physicality and tactical sense to excel in this position.

==Personal life==
His older brother Andrei Alenichev also played football professionally. He has two sons, Maksim (born 2001) and Daniil (born 2004) who followed on his footsteps and became footballers too. As of 2024, Maksim is a free agent after playing in the third-tier Russian Second League, and Daniil plays for the Under-23 squad of the Portuguese club Leixões.

Alenichev joined the United Russia party. On 14 June 2007, he was voted the representative of the Omsk Oblast in the Federation Council of Russia. He represented it until 2010, when he accepted the position of head coach of the Russia national under-18 team.

In 2009, Alenichev was part of the Russia squad that won the 2009 Legends Cup.

<text>is a Japanese transportation company. It owns a fleet that includes dry cargo ships (bulk carriers), container ships, liquefied natural gas carriers, Ro-Ro ships, tankers, and container terminals. It used to be the fourteenth largest container transportation and shipping company in the world, before becoming part of Ocean Network Express in 2017.

== History ==
===1919-1944===
&quot;K&quot; Line traces its origin to Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which itself was born in 1878, when founder and entrepreneur Kawasaki Shōzō established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo, Japan, which, eighteen years later, in 1896, was incorporated as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd.

The shipping activities were developed when Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd. (predecessor of Kawasaki Heavy Industries)&#x27;s President Kojiro Matsukata, decided to develop shipping services so as to provide business to Kawasaki Dockyard and to serve Japan&#x27;s national industrial and trade interests.

To do so, he placed Kawasaki Kisen, Kawasaki Zosen and Kokusai Kisen under joint management to build a stronger fleet of 40 to 50 ships serving the Atlantic, North and South America, Africa and the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.

The three firms&#x27; initials were combined to form the moniker &quot;K Line&quot; in 1921.

K Line founder, Kojiro Matsukata, was also known as an art collector. The National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo&#x27;s Ueno Park was established around the core of Matsukata&#x27;s private collection. In addition, the Tokyo National Museum houses his extensive collection of Ukiyo-eprints.

In 1926, according to Lloyds, the newly established &quot;K&quot; Line reached the rank of 13th in the world, behind compatriots NYK (9th) but ahead of O.S.K. (14th).

By the end of World War II, Kawasaki Kisen had lost 56 vessels; 12 survived.

Prior to World War II, the holding company Kawasaki Heavy Industries was part of the Kobe Kawasaki zaibatsu, which included Kawasaki Steel and Kawasaki Kisen. After the war, KHI became part of the DKB Group (keiretsu).

===1945-1961===
During that vital recovery period, &quot;K&quot; Line steadily returned to the building and operation of ships, reestablished bases of operation around the world, increased earnings and took other steps to restore corporate strength and vibrancy of the company.

===1962-1967===
After the merger with Iino Kisen, &quot;K&quot; Line was newly capitalized at ¥9 billion and controlled a fleet of 104 ships, 55 of which were also owned by &quot;K&quot; Line. The merger gave &quot;K&quot; Line a solid foundation to advance dynamically into the future both as one of the world&#x27;s largest shipping lines in terms of fleet size and as a well-balanced, integrated organization.

===1971===
K Line opens International Transportation Service, a container terminal company in the Port of Long Beach.

The Car Carrier transport division was inaugurated with the launch of the new Roll-on/roll-off vessel Toyota Maru No. 10.
K-Line would thereafter enlarge the fleet up to 70 Car carriers vessels. All owned RORO vessels started to include in the first part of their names the word “Highway” (opposite to its container fleet&#x27;s vessels that include the word “Bridge” into their names), to symbolize a link in between Japan and the rest of the world served by sea.

===2003===
KESS - K Line Europe Short Sea is inaugurated in July 2003 in Germany, as a dedicated feeder operator in Europe specialized in brand new cars shipping in between 
European, Scandinavian, Baltic and Mediterranean ports.
The company tonnage is composed of 11 Roll-on/roll-off ships.

===2007===
K Line Offshore AS was founded in Arendal, Norway in October 2007 as a subsidiary of K Line to provide offshore support services to oil and gas fields. They have commissioned new ships suitable for oil and gas fields in ultra-deep water, harsh environments and/or remote areas.

On September 30, 2007, Shuichiro Maeda, K-Line president, said the company will build 10 cargo ships to be manned by an all-Filipino officers and crew. The vessels are expected to be finished by 2010. It will employ 7,000 Filipinos in the next 4 years (3,330 officers and 3,600 ratings or crew). K-Line will build the K-Line Maritime Academy-Philippines operational in February 2008 and is intended to train at least 10,000 seafarers a year.
===2017===

In 2017, K Line, Nippon Yusen (NYK) and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) announced that they would merge and jointly operate their global container shipping services as Ocean Network Express (ONE), in order to better compete against other global container shipping groups. ONE would merge all container shipping services of the three companies, as well as their port terminal operating subsidiaries in various countries, except in Japan, while keeping their other shipping services separate. ONE began operations on April 1, 2018. with the company headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, a business operation headquarters in Singapore and regional headquarters in: London, United Kingdom; Richmond, Virginia; and São Paulo, Brazil.


===2018===
On 23 July, KESS car carrier Makassar Highway ran hard aground at full speed in the Tjust archipelago near Loftahammar, Sweden, causing an oil spill. By his own account, the captain had ordered a course close to land, far from established shipping lanes, in order to gain mobile phone reception. The ship&#x27;s satellite communication system and black box were inoperable when departing Cuxhaven for Södertälje, and alarm systems had been disabled. The Swedish Coast Guard recovered approximately of oil by 30 July, but thousands of litres of oil nevertheless washed up on the coast. An estimated of oil were spilled. The ship was towed to Oskarshamn, where its cargo of 1,325 vehicles were offloaded. The chief mate was taken into custody and accepted a fine for intoxication and recklessness in maritime traffic. His blood alcohol content by mass at the time of the accident was estimated at 1.15 permille, based on samples taken after the accident. The oil spill is also being investigated as an environmental crime.

A few month earlier, the Makassar Highway had collided with the dredger &quot;Xiang Wang Cai 17&quot; near the Chinese city of Zhangzhou. According to investigations, the Makassar Highway was also responsible for the collision.

===2019===
On 15 June 2019, car carrier Diamond Highway caught fire while sailing in between the ports of Singapore and Batangas. Philippine Coast Guard was alerted, and a mission to rescue the 25 members of the Crew was undertaken by another car carrier sailing in proximity. The ship had to be abandoned, and later towed to dry dock. The reason why the fire broke out is unknown but possibly related to the cargo on board.

On 2 August 2019, K-Line was convicted and fined AUD34.5 million for criminal cartel conduct by the Australian Federal Court. The cartel, which was in place from 1997, had fixed prices for the transport of vehicles into Australia. The other cartel participant, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK), was also convicted and fined in 2017.

=== 2023 ===
Around midnight on July 26, 2023, a fire broke out on the Fremantle Highway car transporter operated by &quot;K&quot; Lines. The ship, which came from the port of Bremerhaven, Germany was on its way to the Suez Canal and, according to the Dutch coast guard, was around 27 kilometers north of the Dutch Wadden Sea island of Ameland at that time. The ship had 3,783 vehicles on board, including 498 electric cars. The cause of the fire is unknown, according to the Coast Guard; Media reports that an electric car had started the fire.

During the extinguishing work on board, one crew member died and 16 were injured. The Dutch Coast Guard rescued the remaining 22 members of the crew.

The extinguishing work was difficult because the bow is 30 meters high. An environmental disaster was feared if the ship would have sunk. After the fire had burned out, &quot;Fremantle Highway&quot; was towed into Eemshaven, Groningen (Netherlands) on 3 August.

<text>I Am Spock is the second volume of actor and director Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s autobiography. The book was published in 1995, four years after the release of the last &quot;Star Trek&quot; motion picture starring the entire original cast, and covers the majority of Nimoy&#x27;s time with &quot;Star Trek&quot; in general and Mr. Spock in particular. The book&#x27;s title was a reference to the first volume of his autobiography, &quot;I Am Not Spock&quot;, which had been published in 1975. At that time, Nimoy had sought to distance his own personality from that of the character of Spock, although he nonetheless remained proud of his time on the show. Negative fan reaction to the title gave Nimoy the idea for the title of the second volume.

==Synopsis==
In his second autobiography, Nimoy explains that the title of the first book had been his idea, over the objections of his publishers. He had not anticipated the problem of people reading the title without reading the book. In reality, his feelings toward Spock had not changed at all in the intervening years. On the contrary, Nimoy explains in this book that Spock has always been a part of him.

This duality is explored and taken to extremes throughout the book. Indeed, the book&#x27;s foreword is written by Mr. Spock himself, in the form of a letter the Vulcan writes to Leonard Nimoy, to express confusion over the highly illogical title. Throughout the book, Nimoy frequently has conversations with his other half, as he explores the choices and decisions he has made throughout his life, and how those choices have been affected by a certain calm logical voice in the back of his mind.

While the focus of the book is on Nimoy&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; career, he also takes time to explore his other works, including directing and theatre acting. Memorable stories include his being forced to tell an actress she needed to redo a highly emotional scene because of a crew member&#x27;s mistake, and how directing &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; led to Hollywood giving him a shot at directing &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; (1987), which went on to be the highest-grossing film in the United States of that year. He also mentions his work producing and directing the UPN television series &quot;Deadly Games.&quot;

On the topic of Spock&#x27;s future, Nimoy notes that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise shows no sign of dying, and that as far as he is concerned, Spock is still alive and well working on Romulus.

==Reception==
Anita Gates of The New York Times praised his &quot;pleasant, conversational writing style&quot; and said &quot;his affection for the Spock experience rings very true&quot;.
Publishers Weekly wrote: &quot;Nimoy&#x27;s admirers may find this fairly impersonal memoir disappointing; it touches only tangentially on the author&#x27;s private life. But this is an intelligent and entertaining look at an actor&#x27;s engagement with a character who &quot;seemed to take on an existence of his own.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="1132433" wikidata="Q426790" url="?curid=1132433" title="The Omega Glory">
<text>&quot;The Omega Glory&quot; is the twenty-third episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Gene Roddenberry and directed by Vincent McEveety, it was first broadcast March 1, 1968. In the episode, Captain Kirk must find the cure to a deadly disease and put an end to another Starfleet captain&#x27;s cultural interference. The story was one of three outlines submitted for selection as the second pilot of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the others being &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot; and &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;.

Retrospective reviews of &quot;The Omega Glory&quot; rank it among the worst episodes of the original series.

==Plot==
As the Federation Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; approaches the planet Omega IV, the USS &quot;Exeter&quot; is found orbiting it. Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Dr. McCoy and Lt. Galloway beam over to the Exeter to investigate. They find the ship deserted, save for a few uniforms that are covered with a crystalline substance found to be human remains. The ship&#x27;s logs reveal that the &quot;Exeter&quot;″s crew died from an infectious disease that had been brought from the planet, and that &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s landing party is now infected and must beam down to the planet if they are to survive.

Kirk&#x27;s party beams down to the last coordinates stored in the &quot;Exeter&quot;″s computer. There, they discover &quot;Exeter&quot; Captain Ron Tracey (Morgan Woodward) in what resembles a traditional Chinese village. Tracey explains that he had been on the planet when the disease had ravaged his ship, stranding him. He says he has discovered that remaining on the planet confers immunity to the disease. He then reveals that the villagers he is living with on the planet, known as &quot;Kohms&quot;, are at war with &quot;savages&quot; called &quot;Yangs&quot;.

After a Yang attack, Spock investigates the field of battle and finds evidence that Tracey has been helping the Kohms, in violation of the Prime Directive. Kirk tries to contact the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but is prevented by Tracey, who tries to justify his violation by revealing that the planet’s natives are not only immune to the mysterious disease, but have also developed lifespans of over 1000 years.

Tracey orders McCoy to investigate the secret of their longevity and has Kirk and Spock locked up in a crude jail with two Yang prisoners, one male and one female. Kirk has the male Yang loosen the bars of the cell window, but the untrusting Yang knocks Kirk out and escapes with the woman. When Kirk recovers, he and Spock make their own escape.

Spock is reunited with McCoy, and modifies some medical equipment, turning it into a makeshift communicator, but Tracey discovers this and destroys it. McCoy and Kirk try to explain to Tracey that they have discovered that the natives&#x27; longevity has nothing to do with their immunity to the disease, but Tracey&#x27;s mind snaps, and he attempts to force Kirk to order more weapons to be sent down from &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

During a struggle between the two, Yang warriors arrive and carry everyone back to their village. It turns out that their leader is Kirk&#x27;s former cellmate, known as Cloud William. During a ceremony to celebrate the Yang victory, Kirk and Spock, discussing the Yang culture, connect the names &quot;Yang&quot; and &quot;Kohm&quot; with &quot;Yankee&quot; and &quot;Communist&quot;. Spock then conjectures that the history of Omega IV had closely paralleled that of Earth until the former was devastated by a biological war that Earth had avoided. This hypothesis is confirmed when William produces a very old American flag, along with ancient documents from which he recites the Pledge of Allegiance in a garbled accent. The Yangs are shocked when Kirk chimes in to recite the end of the Pledge.

Tracey, in an attempt to save his own life, denounces Kirk and Spock, claiming that they have been cast out of heaven, and points to Spock&#x27;s similar appearance to the devil as proof. William asks Kirk to prove himself by completing the &quot;sacred words&quot; from another document. Because of the accent, Kirk doesn&#x27;t understand the words and instead suggests a trial by combat between himself and Tracey. As they fight, Spock sends a telepathic suggestion to William&#x27;s female companion to activate the communicator, lying near her, which she does. Sulu thereby learns what’s going on, beams down with a security team to investigate, and takes Tracey into custody.

Cloud William now kneels before Kirk as if he were a deity, but Kirk orders him to stand. The second document proves to be a version of the American Constitution. Kirk rebukes the Yangs for forgetting its meaning, and declares that the words were meant not just for the Yangs, but &quot;must apply to everyone or they mean nothing.&quot; William does not fully understand, but swears to Kirk that the words will be obeyed. As the landing party leaves, Kirk pays a moment of silent tribute to the flag.

==Analysis==
According to author Daniel Leonard Bernardi in his book, &quot;Star Trek and History: Race-ing Toward a White Future&quot;: &quot;Like the Federation, the Comms [sic] have full command of the English language (although they speak with a homogenized &#x27;Asian&#x27; accent). The beginning of the episode thus shows that those with white skin can be uncivilized savages and those with yellow skin can be civilized and rational [...] This would be counter to the hegemonic representation of Asians in the United States media; that diverse collective of peoples are consistently constructed in film and television as a menacing &#x27;yellow horde.&#x27;&quot;

Bernardi goes on to say:

Allan W. Austin, Professor of History at Misericordia University, writes that this episode

Like Bernardi, Austin discusses racial stereotypes in the episode. Citing Bernardi, he argues that, instead of considering &quot;the Yangs as noble savages, the Yangs can now be seen as an example of the result of mindless nationalism run amok, albeit still salvageable in Roddenberry&#x27;s ever-optimistic view of the future.&quot; He adds, &quot;Many of the qualities ascribed to the Yangs mirrored terms used to describe the &#x27;yellow peril&#x27; at an earlier time in U.S. history. For example, Tracy, after noting directly that the Yangs are white, describes them as vicious and deceptive enemies who cannot communicate intelligently.&quot;

In &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, a 2006 essay reflecting on stories that have tried to imagine the future, Michael Chabon says, &quot;Eed plebnista, intoned the devolved Yankees, in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &#x27;The Omega Glory&#x27;, who had somehow managed to hold on to and venerate as sacred gobbledygook the Preamble to the Constitution, norkon forden perfectunun. All they needed was a Captain Kirk to come and add a little interpretive water to the freeze-dried document, and the American way of life would flourish again.&quot;

==Production==
This story was originally offered by Roddenberry as an option for the second pilot titled &quot;The Omega Story&quot;. The original script, while not significantly different in tone and message, did have some significant differences in characterization and background information. Since the character of Dr. Leonard McCoy had not been created yet, the ship&#x27;s surgeon is named Milton Perry, and in one version of the script it is Perry who attempts to use a &quot;Medi-Scanner&quot; to signal the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, hoping for rescue - only to be killed when Captain Tracey destroys the scanner with his phaser. In addition, the script called for Dr. Carter of the &quot;Exeter&quot; to be shown dissolving onscreen.

William Ware Theiss (the costume designer) made a production error and mistakenly gave the crew of the USS Exeter a unique uniform insignia, different from the iconic delta on the uniforms of the Enterprise’s crew. The mistake was caught before the episode aired, but it was too late to correct it. A memo was immediately sent out announcing that Gene Roddenberry had been consulted, and that, going forward, every starship crew’s uniform should have same delta insignia that is on the uniforms worn by the Enterprise crew.

== Reception ==
In 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; highlighted the scene where Kirk reads the United States Constitution, as one of the most important moments in that character&#x27;s life.

WhatCulture ranked this episode the 15th worst episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2016, SyFy included this episode in a group of &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise episodes they felt were commonly disliked but &quot;deserved a second chance&quot;.

In 2017, this episode was rated the 8th worst episode of the Star Trek franchise up to that time, by &quot;ScreenRant&quot;. In 2018, CBR included this episode on a ranking of episodes they stated were &quot;So Bad They Must Be Seen&quot;. CBS News listed &quot;The Omega Glory&quot; as one of the worst episodes of the original series.

In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the 5th worst &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series.

<doc id="1132434" wikidata="Q7162661" url="?curid=1132434" title="Penfolds Grange">
<text>Penfolds Grange (until the 1989 vintage labelled Penfolds Grange Hermitage) is an Australian wine, made predominantly from the Shiraz (Syrah) grape and usually a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon. It is widely considered one of Australia&#x27;s &quot;first growth&quot; and its most collectable wine. The term &quot;Hermitage&quot;, the name of a French wine appellation, was commonly used in Australia as another synonym for Shiraz or Syrah. Penfolds is owned by Treasury Wine Estates.

==1950s–1960s==
The first vintage of Penfolds Grange was made on an experimental basis in 1951 by Penfolds winemaker Max Schubert and were largely given away at the time. Having toured Europe in 1950, Schubert implemented wine-making techniques observed in Bordeaux upon his return, aiming to create a red wine able to rival the finest Bordeaux wines both in terms of quality and ageing potential.

Individual bottles of the 1951 vintage are still held by collectors; one sold at auction in 2004 for just over $50,000 AUD. The first vintage to be commercially released was the 1952. Penfolds Grange was styled as a powerful still wine in an age when fortified wines were in fashion. Negative reviews by wine critics and poor commercial prospects for the wine led Penfolds management in 1957 to forbid Schubert from producing Penfolds Grange, but Schubert persisted in secret through 1959. As the initial vintages aged, however, their true value came to be appreciated, and in 1960 the management instructed Schubert to restart production, oblivious to the fact that Schubert had never stopped production and had not missed a vintage.

The great 1955 vintage was submitted to competitions beginning in 1962, and over the years has won more than 50 gold medals. The vintage of 1971 won first prize in Shiraz at the Wine Olympics in Paris. The 1990 vintage was named &#x27;Wine of the Year&#x27; by the &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; magazine in 1995, which later rated the 1998 vintage 99 points out of a possible 100.

Penfolds Grange also carries a &quot;Bin&quot; designation, referring to its storage location in Penfolds cellars while aging. 1951 was Bin 1, 1952 was Bin 4, and later vintages carried various designations. By 1964 the designation was standardised as &quot;Bin 95&quot;.

==1970s–1980s==
The 1971 vintage received the top score against other renowned international wines of the 1970s in a blind tasting with an international panel of judges in 2015. Originally released for around AUD $10 in 1976 the 1971 sells at auction between AUD $700 and AUD $1,100.

Schubert retired in 1975, passing the custodianship of Grange to Don Ditter. Ditter had been working at Penfolds since 1950 after graduating from Roseworthy Agricultural College.

Ditter retired as Penfolds&#x27; Chief Winemaker in 1986. During his time as Chief Winemaker several highly regarded Grange vintages were released, including 1976 and 1986. 1976 was awarded 100 points by American critic Robert Parker Jr. 1986, Ditter&#x27;s last vintage, has been labelled as the &#x27;defining vintage of the 1980s&#x27; as well as an &#x27;important and very successful vintage&#x27;.

John Duval assumed the mantle of Penfolds Chief Winemaker from Ditter in 1986 until resigning in 2002. He was named International Winemaker of the Year in 1989 by the UK&#x27;s International Wine &amp; Spirit Competition.

==1990s==
The 1990 vintage of Grange attracted a great amount of interest after Wine Spectator Magazine named it their &#x27;Wine of the Year&#x27; in 1995. The name &quot;Hermitage&quot; was dropped from the label with the 1990 vintage, following objections by the European Union authorities to the use of a French place-name; no third-country wine entering EU may carry a geographical name recognised by European wine officials.

In 1991 and in 2000, Duval was named Red Winemaker of the Year at the International Wine Challenge in London. Each of these awards were conferred during Duval&#x27;s period as custodian of Grange.

Duval also oversaw the &#x27;White Grange&#x27; project at Penfolds. This project was intended to produce a white wine that would equal the quality and reputation of Grange. The resultant wine, Penfolds Yattarna, was first released with the 1995 vintage.

==2000s==
In 2002, Peter Gago assumed custodianship of Penfolds Grange as the replacement Chief Winemaker for the outgoing John Duval. During the ensuing years Gago has overseen a number of highly acclaimed Grange vintages, including 2008.

The 2008 vintage of Grange was awarded &#x27;perfect&#x27; 100-point ratings from two influential American wine reviewers, &quot;Wine Spectator&quot;. and &quot;Wine Advocate&quot;. With these accolades this vintage became the first &#x27;New World&#x27; wine to receive 100 points from both reviewers.

==Collectability==
By the end of the 1980s the wine came to be regarded as a collectors&#x27; item. The first vintage, 1951, is now considered highly collectable with one sold at auction in 2004 for just over $50,000 AUD. Collections of Grange have been sold at auction in Australia for AUD $431,000.

Listed in the 4th edition of Langton’s Classification of Australian Wine at the &quot;Exceptional&quot; level, Grange has been in the top Langton classification since 1991.

Penfolds Grange is the only wine to be heritage listed by the South Australian National Trust.

==Production style==
Unlike most expensive cult wines from the Old World which are from single vineyards or even small plots (called blocks) within vineyards, Grange is made from grapes harvested over a wide area. This means that the precise composition of the wine changes from year to year; it is the expertise of the winemakers which purchasers value, rather than the qualities of the specific places where the grapes are grown, or the particular vines. The quantity of Penfolds Grange produced varies from year to year, with 1,800 bottles of the original 1951 vintage produced. Gago states that 7,000 to 9,000 cases are made each vintage as of 2013. Despite the vagaries of grape sourcing and vintage variation due to growing conditions, some believe that there is a consistent and recognisable &quot;Penfolds Grange&quot; style.

==Ownership==
In the 1980s, Tooth &amp; Co. (who were then part of the Adelaide Steamship Group) purchased a number of wineries, including Penfolds. AdSteam sold its wineries to SA Brewing Holdings in 1990, who then amalgamated all of its wine holdings into &quot;The Penfolds Wines Group&quot;. In 1994 SA Brewing Holdings split into three companies: brewing into SA Brewing Company, wine in Southcorp Wines, and other activities into Southcorp. Upon its acquisition of Southcorp Wines in May 2005, ownership of the Penfolds brand, along with its museum collection of Penfolds Grange, passed to the Foster&#x27;s Group.
In May 2011 Penfolds, along with the rest of Foster&#x27;s wine brands, were spun off into Treasury Wine Estates, a separate company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.
