==History==
===National Rail===
The station was opened by the Mid-Kent Railway (MKR) on 1 January 1857 as the terminus of the line from Lewisham; it became a junction on 3 May 1858 when the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway Farnborough Extension line from Crystal Palace to Shortlands was opened. On 1 July 1863 the London Chatham &amp; Dover Railway Metropolitan Extension from Beckenham to Victoria/Blackfriars completed the lines serving the station. In 1863 the MKR was taken over by the South Eastern Railway (SER) and thereafter the station was operated jointly by the LCDR and SER. Despite a partial rebuilding in 1890 the original MKR building is still in use as the main station offices and booking hall.

From December 2007, a significant upgrade to train services at Beckenham Junction took place, with an increase in frequency of the London Victoria to Orpington services (off peak) to every 15 mins. Until Section 2 of High Speed 1 opened in 2007 Eurostar services passed the station, but did not stop. In December 2010 Southern increased the number of evening services on Monday-Saturdays so that trains would run to London Bridge Station later into the evening.

===Tramlink===

The two platform Tramlink stop opened in 2000, with the rest of the route to the Croydon loop. The stop is outside the station, across the car park, beside the A2015 road, which avoids Beckenham town centre.

===Accidents and incidents===
*On 22 January 1990, 4EPB electric multiple unit 5408 collided with the buffer stop on arrival from and was derailed.

<doc id="1142528" wikidata="Q5385728" url="?curid=1142528" title="Erewash Canal">
<text>The Erewash Canal is a broad canal in Derbyshire, England. It runs just under and has 14 locks. The first lock at Langley Bridge is part of the Cromford Canal.
==Origins==

The canal obtained its act of Parliament, the (17 Geo. 3. c. 69), with John Varley appointed as engineer and John and James Pinkerton the main contractors, it was completed in 1779 at a cost of £21,000 (£ in 2015). It was a commercial success from the start mainly transporting coal.

The canal&#x27;s success kept it going far longer than many of its contemporaries in the face of competition from the railways. When the Grand Union Canal Company took over the running of the Erewash in 1932 it was still a going concern. The canal was nationalised in 1947. By this time the closure of feeder canals resulting in a loss of trade and competition from other forms of transport was making itself felt and the last commercial narrowboat delivered its cargo in 1952. In 1962 the British Transport Commission closed the top section of canal. However, it was kept in water to supply the lower half of the canal and it remained navigable.

The Erewash Canal Preservation and Development Association, ECP&amp;DA was formed in 1968 with the purpose of restoring the canal to full navigation; the achievement of this goal was celebrated with a boat rally in 1973 at the Great Northern Basin in Langley Mill.

The main line from Long Eaton to Langley Mill was one of seven stretches of canal, formally designated as remainder waterways, which were re-classified by the British Waterways Act 1983. Under the act, a total of 82 route miles (132 km) were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard.

==Shipley Wharf==
At the turn of the twentieth century Shipley Wharf directly above Shipley Lock was very busy with the transhipment of coal from railway wagons which had descended an incline from the Shipley Collieries to narrowboats on the Erewash Canal.
There was also a much earlier wagonway which connected the Shipley collieries to Shipley wharf between the completion of the Erewash Canal in 1779 and the completion of the Nutbrook Canal in 1796, from which point in time the Nutbrook Canal took this traffic.
The incline in use at the end of the nineteenth century was originally built to connect the Shipley Collieries, then owned by the Miller-Mundy family with the Midland Railway&#x27;s Erewash Valley railway line and was operated for this purpose between 1848 and 1870. Problems with the Nutbrook Canal&#x27;s water supply instigated the re-laying of rails on the incline and its extension under the Midland Railway&#x27;s Erewash Valley line and under the Midland Railway&#x27;s Eastwood Colliery branch line, to Shipley Wharf. Coal was loaded into narrowboats here from 1895 until 1942.
The sidings at the wharf were laid in a triangle. The coal wagons descended the incline under braking relying on gravity and accumulated momentum to carry them to the sidings where they were connected to an endless rope kept in motion by a stationary steam engine in the centre of the triangle. The endless rope went around three wheels at the corners of the triangle. One was sited on the Erewash Canal&#x27;s aqueduct which spanned the Erewash River, a second was under the bridge which carried the Eastwood Colliery&#x27;s branch line over the Shipley line and the third was alongside Eastwood Lock. Using this mechanism the colliery wagons were brought alongside the wharf and could be emptied directly into waiting narrowboats.

==Eastwood Colliery==
Eastwood Colliery was situated on a narrow plot of land sandwiched between the Nottingham Canal and the Erewash Canal just above the Erewash Canal&#x27;s Eastwood Lock. It was originally owned by Doctor Manson but was taken over by Barber Walker and Company. It was served by a branch line from the Great Northern Railway departing the main line close to Newthorpe and Greasley railway station. The colliery was also served by a branch line of the Midland Railway&#x27;s Erewash Valley line departing the main line at Shipley Gate. Some of the embankments of the two branches are still in existence. The bridge abutments for the Midland Railway&#x27;s wooden bridge which once stood directly below the Eastwood Lock can still be seen. The colliery was therefore, well served with transport options with the choice of two canals and two railways to export their coal. The Great Northern Railway branch crossed the Nottingham Canal using a swing bridge. The railway swing bridge no longer exists but the pedestrian bridge built next to it is still in use. Excessive water underground brought about the mine&#x27;s closure in about 1884.

== The canal today ==
*
It starts from the River Trent at Trent Lock, then goes through Long Eaton. After Long Eaton it runs roughly parallel to the River Erewash, past Sandiacre and Ilkeston, crossing the Erewash near Eastwood. The canal finally ends at the Langley Mill (Great Northern) basin, where it joins the Nottingham Canal and the Cromford Canal (both currently in a state of abandonment).

In 1968 the Erewash Canal Preservation &amp; Development Association (ECP&amp;DA) was formed in response to a threat by the British Waterways Board to close the canal. One of the ECP&amp;DA&#x27;s achievements was the re-opening of the Great Northern Basin at Langley Mill. This canal basin was the point at which the Cromford, Erewash and Nottingham Canals met. The Langley Mill Boat Company formed in 1974 and based at the Great Northern Basin has cleared and put back into water a short section of the Cromford Canal
connected to the basin. Today the Erewash Canal is fully open and is actively used by pleasure cruisers.
At present [2006] the section of canal running through Long Eaton is oft frequented by pleasure craft; the factories which follow the canal along the Northern march of the town are no longer associated with the waterway, and fencing separates them from it.

However, these factories only block the western bank of the canal.
The towpath, which follows the eastern bank, carries
Route 67 of the National Cycle Network between the Lawrence Street access and Stanton Lock where the cycle route diverges to follow the Nutbrook Valley.

Near Ilkeston, the canal passes close to the disused but scenic Bennerley Viaduct.

The canal is also regularly restocked with fish for anglers, and along the eastern tow path dozens of anglers are often seen.

==Canal vandalism during lockdown==
On 29 May 2020 the owners of the canal announced that locks along a section of the canal had been clamped open at weekends causing it to empty during the COVID-19 lockdown. The section between Dockholme Lock and Long Eaton Lock was affected. The owners said that the vandalism had killed many fish, left others with breathing problems and washed birds nests away. Derbyshire Police were investigating the vandalism.

<doc id="1142530" wikidata="Q164784" url="?curid=1142530" title="Jean Gaston Darboux">
<text>Jean-Gaston Darboux FAS MIF FRS FRSE (14 August 1842 – 23 February 1917) was a French mathematician.

==Life==
According to his birth certificate, he was born in Nîmes in France on 14 August 1842, at 1 am. However, probably due to the midnight birth, Darboux himself usually reported his own birthday as 13 August, &quot;e.g.&quot; in his filled form for Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

His parents were François Darboux, businessman of mercery, and Alix Gourdoux. The father died when Gaston was 7. His mother undertook the mercery business with great courage, and insisted that her children receive good education. Gaston had a younger brother, Louis, who taught mathematics at the Lycée Nîmes for almost his entire life.

He studied at the Nîmes Lycée and the Montpellier Lycée before being accepted as the top qualifier at the École normale supérieure in 1861, and received his PhD there in 1866. His thesis, written under the direction of Michel Chasles, was titled &quot;Sur les surfaces orthogonales&quot;. During his studies at the ENS, he also took lectures in Sorbonne University and Collège de France.

In 1870, he co-founded the journal &quot;Bulletin des sciences mathématiques et astronomiques&quot;, called &quot;Darboux&#x27;s Journal&quot; by his contemporary mathematicians. The editorial board was also formed by the mathematicians Paul Émile Appell, Émile Borel, Jacques Hadamard and Amedeo Guillet, with Darboux in the role of President. The publishing house was the Henry Gauthier-Villars et Cie Éditeurs, located in Paris.

In 1872, Darboux married the Beauvaisian milliner Amélie &quot;Célina&quot; Carbonnier (1848-1911), daughter of Charles Louis Carbonnier, tailor, and Marie Victorine Anastase Hènocq. He and Célina had two children, Jean-&quot;Gaston&quot; (1870-1921), who was born at the time of the Siege of Paris and later became a marine zoologist at the Faculty of Science in Marseille, and Anaïs Berthe &quot;Lucie&quot; (1873-1970).

He participated in the foundation of the École normale supérieure de jeunes filles in 1880, an institute that aimed at training female educators and ran parallel to the École normale supérieure on rue d&#x27;Ulm. Its first director was Julie Favre.

In 1884, Darboux was elected to the Académie des Sciences.

Darboux made several important contributions to geometry and mathematical analysis (see, for example, linear PDEs). He was a biographer of Henri Poincaré and he edited the Selected Works of Joseph Fourier.

Among his students were Émile Borel, Élie Cartan, Édouard Goursat, Émile Picard, Gheorghe Țițeica and Stanisław Zaremba.

In 1900, he was appointed the Academy&#x27;s permanent secretary of its Mathematics section.

In 1902, he was elected to the Royal Society and the American Philosophical Society; in 1916, he received the Sylvester Medal from the Society. In 1908, he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome.
He continued to contribute to the French &quot;Bulletin des sciences mathématiques&quot;, even after 1916.

<text>Michael Maltese (February 6, 1908 – February 22, 1981) was an American screenwriter and storyboard artist for classic animated cartoon shorts. He is best known for working in the 1950s on a series of &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons with director Chuck Jones. This collaboration produced many highly acclaimed animated shorts, including 4 of the top 5 &quot;greatest cartoons&quot; as judged by 1000 animation professionals; &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; tops this list as the best animated short of all time.

== Early life ==
The son of Italian immigrants, Maltese graduated from the National Academy of Design. He married Florence Sass in April 1936; writer Warren Foster served as best man.

== Career ==
Michael Maltese began his career in animation as a cel painter at Fleischer Studios in 1935. A year later, he was fired for quickly moving himself up position after being promoted to an assistant animator.

After a brief stint at the Jam Handy Organization, Maltese was hired by Leon Schlesinger Productions in April 1937 as an in-betweener, and later a storyman due to everyone laughing at his jokes. Maltese would first appear on camera in the 1940 Porky Pig cartoon &quot;You Ought to Be in Pictures&quot; as a live-action guard at the Warner Bros. entrance gate, who winds up chasing the animated Porky around the Warners lot. The first cartoon he was credited for Warner&#x27;s was &quot;The Haunted Mouse&quot; (1941) by Tex Avery, although he wrote rejected gags for The Timid Toreador. Maltese, typically in collaboration with Tedd Pierce, would provide most of the stories for directors Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones from 1943 to 1946, following which he dissolved his partnership with Pierce and mainly worked with Jones. He and Jones collaborated on cartoons like the Academy Award-winning &quot;For Scent-imental Reasons&quot; (1949), featuring the character Pepé Le Pew, and the animated public health documentary, &quot;So Much for So Little&quot; (1949) which won that same year for &quot;Best Documentary Short Subject&quot;. Maltese was also the voice of the Lou Costello-esque character in &quot;Wackiki Wabbit&quot; (1943) and the Benito Mussolini duck in &quot;The Ducktators&quot; (1942).

Some of his earlier works include &quot;The Wabbit Who Came to Supper&quot; and &quot;Fresh Hare&quot;, &quot;Hare Trigger&quot; (which introduced Yosemite Sam) and &quot;Baseball Bugs&quot; for Freleng and &quot;Bear Feat&quot;, &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot;, &quot;A Pest in the House&quot;, and &quot;Rabbit Fire&quot; for Jones. Some of his best-known cartoons are &quot;Feed the Kitty&quot;, &quot;Beep, Beep&quot;, &quot;Rabbit Seasoning&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Sheep&quot;, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;, &quot;Bully for Bugs&quot;, &quot;Bewitched Bunny&quot;, &quot;From A to Z-Z-Z-Z&quot;, and &quot;Beanstalk Bunny&quot;, all of which were directed by Jones. He also wrote &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot;, the first appearance of future Warner Brothers mascot Michigan J. Frog&quot;.

Some of his later Warner cartoons included &quot;Ali Baba Bunny&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood Daffy&quot;, the seminal &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; and &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot; for Jones, &quot;Rabbit Romeo&quot; and &quot;Fox-Terror&quot; for Robert McKimson and &quot;Person to Bunny&quot; (the final occasion Arthur Q. Bryan voiced Elmer Fudd) and &quot;Here Today, Gone Tamale&quot; (the only Speedy Gonzales cartoon he ever wrote) for Freleng. Following the shuttering of Jones&#x27;s unit in 1953 (at the height of the 3-D craze), Maltese was hired by Walter Lantz Productions as writer of some Woody Woodpecker cartoons: &quot;Helter Shelter&quot;, &quot;Witch Crafty&quot; (co-written with Homer Brightman), &quot;Real Gone Woody&quot;, &quot;Square Shootin&#x27; Square&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Bedlam&quot;. He also is the writer of Chilly Willy&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated theatrical short &quot;The Legend of Rockabye Point&quot;, directed by fellow Warner alumnus Tex Avery. Jones&#x27;s unit would be resurrected early in 1954, with Maltese departing Lantz to rejoin his longtime collaborator several months afterwards; Maltese&#x27;s first post-shutdown Warner credits by release would be on &quot;Rocket-Bye Baby&quot; and &quot;Gee Whiz-z-z-z-z-z-z&quot;, a Road Runner short. 

Maltese departed Jones&#x27; unit for the second and final time in 1958, with his final credit appearing on 1961&#x27;s &quot;The Mouse on 57th Street&quot;. From 1958 until 1972, he worked at Hanna-Barbera Productions on television cartoons such as &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;, &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and &quot;Wacky Races&quot;. He wrote for a total of 200 storyboards for Hanna-Barbera. He briefly worked with Jones at Sib-Tower 12 Productions on writing Tom and Jerry shorts from 1963 to 1965.

Maltese also wrote comic books published by Western Publishing, including for many of the Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera characters whose animated exploits he scripted.

== Death ==
Maltese died on February 22, 1981, at Los Angeles&#x27;s Good Samaritan Hospital after a six-month bout with cancer, aged 73. His last work was in &quot;Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century&quot;, released in 1980.

<text>Eero Aarnio (born 21 July 1932) is a Finnish designer, noted for his innovative furniture designs in the 1960s, such as his plastic and fibreglass chairs. He was born in Helsinki.
Aarnio studied architecture at the Institute of Industrial Arts in Helsinki and graduated in 1960. He started his own office in 1962. The following year, he introduced his Ball Chair, a hollow sphere on a stand, open on one side to allow a person to sit within. The Ball Chair was introduced to the international public at the Asko stand at the Cologne furniture fair in 1966. The similar Bubble Chair was clear and suspended from above. Other innovative designs included his Pastil Chair (a beanbag-like molded armchair), and Tomato Chair (a seat molded between three supporting spheres). His Screw Table, as the name suggests, had the appearance of a flat head screw driven into the ground. He was awarded the American Industrial Design award in 1968.

Aarnio&#x27;s designs were an important aspect of 1960s popular culture, and could often be seen as part of sets in period science-fiction films. Because his designs used very simple geometric forms, they were ideal for such productions.

Eero Aarnio continues to create new designs, including toys and furniture for children. He was awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro in 2008 for a design called &quot;Trioli&quot;, a combination rocking horse and child-sized chair which is part of a collection for Magis.

Many of Aarnio&#x27;s original designs are today manufactured by Eero Aarnio Originals, which was established in 2016.

In Tite Kubo&#x27;s manga series Bleach, the character Aaroniero Arruruerie is named after Eero Aarnio.

<text>A Christina piercing, also known as a Venus piercing, is a female genital piercing. It is located where the outer labia meet, below the pubic mound. The Christina piercing is anatomy dependent; it has a high rejection rate, and is not possible for all women due to anatomical variation. If the flesh above the clitoris where the outer labia meet is fleshy enough to pinch, a Christina piercing may be successful. If the flesh in this area is too tight to pinch, a Christina piercing is contraindicated. The piercing does not facilitate sexual stimulation and can be found uncomfortable when pressure is applied. It is usually pierced with either a custom-made curved barbell or surface bar to reduce the risk of rejection. 

The Christina piercing is of contemporary origin. The first known Christina piercing was performed in the 1990s. As is common practice in the piercing industry, it was named after the first recipient of the piercing, a woman named Christina. It is also occasionally referred to by the less commonly used term &quot;Venus&quot;, in reference to its placement at the mons Venus.

The piercing usually heals in two to four months. However, complications may occur depending on jewelry and the pierced person&#x27;s anatomy. In some cases, it is performed as a surface piercing. Further difficulties can develop due to the relatively long piercing canal and constant movement and friction. Christina piercings may also be susceptible to infection.

<text>Robert Paisley (23 January 1919 – 14 February 1996) was an English professional football manager and player who played as a wing-half. He spent almost 50 years with Liverpool and is regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time. Reluctantly taking the job in 1974, he built on the foundations laid by his predecessor Bill Shankly. Paisley is the first of four managers to have won the European Cup three times. He is also one of five managers to have won the English top-flight championship as both a player and manager at the same club.

Paisley came from a small County Durham mining community and, in his youth, played for Bishop Auckland, before he signed for Liverpool in 1939. During the Second World War he served in the British Army, and could not make his Liverpool debut until 1946. In the 1946–47 season, he was a member of the Liverpool team that won the First Division title for the first time in 24 years. He was made club captain in 1951, and remained with Liverpool until he retired from playing in 1954.

He stayed with the club, and took on the two roles of reserve team coach and club physiotherapist. By this time, Liverpool had been relegated to the Second Division and its facilities were in decline. Shankly was appointed Liverpool manager in December 1959, and he promoted Paisley to work alongside him as his assistant in a management/coaching team that included Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett. Under their leadership, the fortunes of Liverpool turned around dramatically and, in the 1961–62 season, the team gained promotion back to the First Division. Paisley filled an important role as tactician under Shankly&#x27;s leadership, and the team won numerous honours during the next twelve seasons.

In 1974, Shankly retired as manager and, despite Paisley&#x27;s own initial reluctance, he was appointed as Shankly&#x27;s successor. He went on to lead Liverpool through a period of domestic and European dominance, winning twenty honours in nine seasons: six League Championships, three League Cups, six Charity Shields, three European Cups, one UEFA Cup and one UEFA Super Cup. He won honours at a rate of 2.2 per season, a rate surpassed only by Pep Guardiola. At the time of his retirement he had won the Manager of the Year Award a record six times. He retired from management in 1983 and was succeeded by Joe Fagan. He died in 1996, aged 77, after having Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for several years.

==Early life==
Bob Paisley was born on Thursday 23 January 1919, in the small County Durham coal mining village of Hetton-le-Hole which is seven miles from Sunderland. Paisley described it as &quot;a close-knit community where coal was king and football was religion&quot;. His father Sam was a miner and his mother Emily a housewife. They had four sons: Willie, Bob, Hugh and Alan in age order. On the day Paisley was born, 150,000 miners nationwide went on strike for a shorter working week. Paisley attended a local school until he was thirteen and, like his friends there, had to rely on soup kitchens to supplement a meagre diet. In 1926, during the General Strike when he was seven, he had to scramble over slag heaps to collect coal dust that his parents could mix with water to create a crude fuel. Life was difficult for working-class families and, as Paisley recalled: &quot;We lived in a small terraced house, and although we never went short of life&#x27;s essentials, there was never much money left over by the end of the week&quot;.

Paisley was an outstanding footballer at Eppleton Primary School and helped his team win seventeen trophies in a four-year period. Throughout his playing career, he was a left half. After leaving school at the age of 14, Paisley initially worked alongside his father at the pit and was there when his father had an underground accident which rendered him unable to work for five years. The mine was closed down and he trained to become a bricklayer.

Paisley had joined Hetton Football Club after leaving school in 1933 and continued to attract notice as a member of their junior team. He had a boyhood dream of playing for Sunderland but when he was recommended to them by Hetton he was rejected as being &quot;too small&quot;. Instead, he signed for Bishop Auckland before the 1937–38 season for three shillings and sixpence per match.

==Bishop Auckland and arrival at Liverpool==
Paisley played for &quot;the Bishops&quot; for two seasons until he was signed by Liverpool in May 1939, a few months after his twentieth birthday. The Bishops were one of the top non-league teams in England and Paisley called them &quot;the Kings of Amateur Football&quot;. In Paisley&#x27;s second season with them, they achieved a treble by winning the Northern League championship, the FA Amateur Cup and the Durham County Challenge Cup. The FA Amateur Cup final was played in Durham at Roker Park where the Bishops defeated Willington 3–0 after extra time. During the season, Paisley was approached by Liverpool manager George Kay and promised that he would sign for Liverpool at the end of the season. He kept his promise even though Sunderland reconsidered and made another approach.

Paisley&#x27;s last match for the Bishops was on Saturday, 6 May 1939 in the Durham County Challenge Cup final against South Shields, also played at Roker Park. The following Monday, Paisley travelled by train to Liverpool where he was met at Exchange station by Andy McGuigan who accompanied him to Anfield. He signed his contract and began an association that would last half a century. His signing on fee was £25 and his wages were £8 a week in the season and £6 a week during the summer. He recalled: &quot;I was full of beans that day, but it was very quiet really. I was met at the station and after that long trek up Scotland Road in a tramcar, I found there were only one or two youngsters at the ground – Billy Liddell, Eddie Spicer and Ray Lambert. The rest had been recruited for the territorials&quot;.

Following pre-season training, Paisley took part in two reserve team games at the start of the 1939–40 season but all competitions were cancelled after war was declared on 3 September. Paisley had got to know Matt Busby, who was then Liverpool&#x27;s club captain and was grateful for the advice and encouragement which Busby gave him. Paisley said that Busby was &quot;a man you could look up to and respect&quot;.

On 8 September 1939, the British Government advised The Football Association (the FA) that clubs could stage friendly matches outside evacuation areas and Liverpool were able to take part in such matches, constrained by unavailability of players in the services, throughout the war. Liverpool&#x27;s first wartime friendly was at Sealand Road against Chester on 16 September. Paisley took part in 34 of these matches between 1939 and 1941, scoring ten goals.

==Second World War==
Paisley was twenty when the Second World War began and in October he was called up into the Army who assigned him to the Royal Artillery in which he was a gunner in the 73rd Medium Regiment. This regiment was a war-formed battery unit utilising medium range artillery (field guns) that saw service in the United Kingdom until August 1941, North Africa until 1944 and finally Italy until 1945.

Paisley was stationed at several camps throughout Great Britain including one at Rhyl. For a long time, he was stationed at a camp near Tarporley in Cheshire which was about thirty miles from Anfield. Stan Liversedge describes one occasion when Paisley was given clearance by the Army to play for Liverpool against Everton in the 1940 Liverpool Senior Cup final. To get there, he had to use his bicycle and cycle nearly the whole way. He left the bike in Birkenhead and hitched a lift through the Mersey Tunnel. After the match, he had to do the same journey in reverse to return to camp. Although it was a relatively unimportant match of local interest only, Paisley recalled that &quot;an estimated 30,000 turned up&quot;. Everton, the reigning league champions, won the match 4–2. That was Paisley&#x27;s first encounter with Everton. He got his revenge soon afterwards on 1 April 1940 when he played alongside Matt Busby and Billy Liddell in a depleted Liverpool team who &quot;sprang a surprise&quot; by defeating Everton 3–1 at Goodison Park.

John Keith recounts that Paisley&#x27;s football skills saved him from a posting to the Far East which would inevitably have resulted in his becoming a prisoner of war of the Japanese. He was captain of the 73rd&#x27;s team and, when his battery was due to be posted, his commanding officer transferred him to another battery so that he could remain in Britain and lead the regimental team. His old unit was subsequently overrun by the Japanese.

At the end of August 1941, on the bank holiday, Paisley was posted overseas and did not return to England until 1945. He went in a troopship to Egypt, the voyage lasting ten weeks because they had to sail around South Africa. He spent Christmas in Egypt and then received his first mail from England which turned out to be a postcard from George Kay asking him if he would be available to play for Liverpool against Preston North End (Bill Shankly&#x27;s team) in the season opener three months earlier. While he was in Egypt, Paisley became interested in horse racing through friendship with jockey Reg Stretton and trainer Frank Carr. Paisley learned to ride himself and he retained this interest after the war, often studying form in his spare moments.

He was stationed south of Cairo and learned to drive a 15 cwt. truck. More importantly, he had a month&#x27;s training on firing anti-tank guns, a skill he needed in the desert as a member of the Eighth Army in Operation Crusader which relieved the Siege of Tobruk. During periods of leave from the conflict, Paisley returned to Cairo where he was mostly involved in team sports, not only football but also cricket and hockey. He represented the Combined Services football team as well as playing for his regiment. Paisley was involved in the Second Battle of El Alamein and subsequently fought his way across North Africa until the final defeat of the Afrika Korps in 1943. He only suffered an injury once when he was temporarily blinded by sand sprayed into his face by explosive bullets fired from an aircraft during a Luftwaffe attack on his unit.

In 1943, Paisley went with the Eighth Army into Sicily and then into Italy. Whilst he was on active service in Italy he received the news that his younger brother Alan, aged fifteen, had died at home from scarlet fever and diphtheria. In June 1944, Paisley took part in the liberation of Rome and rode into the city on top of a tank, an event he recalled 33 years later when Liverpool won the 1977 European Cup final in Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico. Paisley&#x27;s regiment moved on to Florence where they encamped at ACF Fiorentina&#x27;s Stadio Artemio Franchi. In Florence, Paisley saw boxing exhibitions by Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson which generated another sporting interest and one for which he and Bill Shankly shared a passion while they worked together.

Paisley finally returned to England in 1945 and was stationed at Woolwich Arsenal until he was demobbed. Shortly before that, he met his future wife Jessie, a schoolteacher, on a train at Maghull. She recalled her father being unimpressed that she had met a soldier who was a professional footballer in civilian life so she added that Paisley had worked as a bricklayer too. Her father said: &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s a proper job so that&#x27;s alright then&quot;. On 17 July 1946, Bob and Jessie were married in Liverpool at All Souls Church, Springwood. They raised a family of two sons and one daughter: Robert, Graham and Christine. The family always lived in Liverpool and Jessie outlived Bob by sixteen years until she died in the early hours of 8 February 2012 as the result of a heart infection, aged 96.

==Liverpool playing career==
In the 1945–46 season, the Football League decided not to revive the championship programme as, with the war only recently concluded, many players were still in the forces and travel could still be difficult to arrange. Instead they organised North and South divisions on a geographical basis to keep travel to a minimum and enable clubs to re-establish themselves without the pressure of official competition. The FA Cup was staged but all ties up to the quarter-final stage were played over two legs to increase the number of meaningful matches in the season.

Paisley eventually made his official debut on 5 January 1946 in Liverpool&#x27;s first post-war competitive match, which was an FA Cup 3rd round, 1st leg away match at Sealand Road, the home ground of Chester. Liverpool won the game 2–0. Paisley&#x27;s league debut would be against Chelsea at Anfield on 7 September 1946, a game Liverpool would win 7-4. His first goal would come on 1 May 1948 in a League game at Anfield, against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Paisley&#x27;s 22nd-minute strike along with a Jack Balmer goal in the 80th were enough to help the Reds win 2–1.

In the first full season after the war, 1946–47, he helped Liverpool to their first league title in 24 years, making 34 appearances in the 42-match season. He remained a fixture in the side, appearing in 30+ matches in 1947–48 and 1948–49 and 28 in 1949–50, a season of both highs and lows for Paisley who scored the opening goal of a 2–0 FA Cup semi-final win over Merseyside rivals Everton only to be dropped for the final against Arsenal, the club&#x27;s first appearance at Wembley. Paisley later said that the experience stood him in good stead when it came to telling players they were not going to play in big games as he knew how they felt. Paisley became club captain the following season.

==Coaching career==
After retiring in 1954, Paisley joined the Liverpool back room staff as a self-taught physiotherapist and was said to have the knack of being able to diagnose a player&#x27;s injury just by looking at them. He later became the reserve team coach and then, in August 1959 when Albert Shelley retired, first team trainer. The arrival of Bill Shankly as manager in December 1959 transformed the fortunes of the club and Paisley recalled that &quot;from the moment he arrived, we got on like a house on fire&quot;. On his first day in charge, Shankly held a meeting with the coaching staff which consisted of Paisley, Reuben Bennett and Joe Fagan to tell them that he was not bringing in his own coaches. He wanted to work with them and so guaranteed them their jobs. Shankly pointed out that he would decide the training strategy and they must all work together with absolutely loyalty to each other and to the club. Under Phil Taylor, training had been the traditional slog of physical exercise and road running. Shankly insisted on training which was &quot;based on speed and using the ball&quot;. Five-a-side games were introduced as a key part of the strategy. Paisley had always been keen on training with the ball and was, like Fagan and Bennett, delighted to implement Shankly&#x27;s methods. Fagan is credited with converting a storage area at Anfield into a &quot;common room&quot; for the coaches and it became the now-legendary Boot Room. Shankly began a Liverpool tradition, later upheld by Paisley and Fagan, of holding daily meetings in there to discuss strategy, tactics, training and players.

Training strategy was key to Liverpool&#x27;s success in the 1960s and afterwards. There was more to it than using the ball and playing five-a-side matches. Influenced by Paisley, Fagan and Bennett, Shankly cottoned on to the importance of allowing players to cool down after training before having a bath or shower. Paisley, as a trained physiotherapist, argued that a person needs to cool down for about forty minutes after heavy exercise because, if they go into a bath while still sweating, their pores remain open and they are more susceptible to chills and strains. Fagan had advocated getting changed at Anfield before going via team bus to the club&#x27;s training complex at Melwood. They would return to bath, change and eat. This routine satisfied the need for a cooling down period and had the added advantages of encouraging team bonding during the two journeys and ensuring familiarity with Anfield, an important need for them as home team. Everton, by contrast, did everything at their Bellefield training complex and their players only went to Goodison Park for home matches every two weeks or so. Shankly claimed that the cooling down period resulted in &quot;an astonishing lack of injuries over many seasons&quot;. For example, in 1965–66 when Liverpool won the league title and reached the European Cup Winners Cup final, they only used fourteen players in the entire season.

Shankly&#x27;s biographer Stephen F. Kelly describes Paisley as &quot;the perfect number two: never a threat to Shankly but always offering wise counsel&quot;. Paisley was an unassuming character and &quot;happy to play second fiddle&quot;, but Kelly recognises his influence because although Shankly was &quot;the great motivating force behind Liverpool, it was Paisley who was the tactician&quot;.

Under Shankly&#x27;s management over the next fifteen years with Paisley as his assistant, Liverpool won three First Division league titles, one Second Division League title, two FA Cups and one UEFA Cup.

==Liverpool manager==

Following victory in the 1974 FA Cup final, Shankly unexpectedly announced his retirement; the Liverpool directors appointed Paisley as his replacement in the hope of maintaining continuity. Though initially reluctant to take on the role, Paisley became a huge success and, apart from his first season, won at least one major trophy in each of his nine years as manager.


After finishing second in 1974–75, the team went on to win the league title and UEFA Cup in 1976. This period marked the beginning of Liverpool&#x27;s dominance of English and European football, as the team went on to become champions on six occasions – finishing second twice – as well as winning three League Cups, one UEFA Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, six Charity Shields and, most significantly, three European Cups. Apart from a fifth-place finish in 1981, Liverpool never finished lower than runners-up in the league with Paisley as manager. Between 1978 and 1981 Paisley&#x27;s team went 63 league games unbeaten at Anfield, a club record until it was surpassed by Jürgen Klopp&#x27;s Liverpool side in November 2020. Liverpool&#x27;s dominance in England was primarily challenged by Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough, and Aston Villa under Ron Saunders and Tony Barton between 1977 and 1982. There were brief challenges from a number of other clubs, Ipswich Town under Bobby Robson in seasons 1980–81 and 1981–82, Manchester City under Tony Book in 1976–77, and Manchester United under Tommy Docherty in 1975–76 and 1976–77.

Paisley, having won 20 major honours in his time as Liverpool manager, remains, to this day, the most successful manager in the club&#x27;s history and the most successful English manager of all time. He won honours at a rate of 2.2 per season, a rate surpassed only by Pep Guardiola.
Paisley remained the only man in history to manage three European Cup winning sides until Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane matched the feat in 2014 and 2018 respectively. He also won an unprecedented six Manager of the Year Awards. The only trophies that Paisley failed to win as manager were the FA Cup, although Liverpool would be runners-up in the 1977 final, the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and the Intercontinental Cup.

Paisley was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1977 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews on board a coach in central London. Following his death in 1996, Paisley was honoured by the club with the opening of the Paisley Gateway at one of the entrances to Anfield, complementing the existing Shankly Gates.

In January 2020, a statue which depicts a scene from 1968, when Paisley carried the injured future Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes off the field, was unveiled outside Anfield. The plinth features a quote from Paisley: &quot;This Club has been my life; I&#x27;d go out and sweep the street and be proud to do it for Liverpool FC if they asked me to.&quot; The 8 ft sculpture was unveiled by some of Paisley&#x27;s players, including Ian Rush, Sir Kenny Dalglish and Phil Thompson, with Liverpool chief executive Peter Moore calling it a &quot;fitting tribute to his legacy&quot;. Paisley also features in the popular Liverpool chant &quot;Allez, Allez, Allez&quot;, which is frequently sung by Liverpool supporters, especially during European matches.

==Retirement from Liverpool==
Paisley retired as Liverpool manager at the end of the 1982–83 season, having spent 44 years at the club in various capacities. He was replaced by Joe Fagan, who would win Liverpool their fourth European Cup. Paisley worked informally as a consultant and advisor to Kenny Dalglish for two years after the latter&#x27;s appointment as player-manager in 1985, before being appointed as a club director. In early 1986, then aged 66, he was interviewed by the Football Association of Ireland with a view to taking charge of the Ireland football team. Jack Charlton was eventually given the job instead.

Paisley is honoured with the Paisley gates outside the Kop at Anfield and would later be honoured with statue with Emlyn Hughes Anfield. 

==Later years and death==

Paisley continued to serve Liverpool as a director until he retired in early 1992 due to ill health, having been diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, something which had become apparent in his early seventies when he was unable to remember his way home when driving back from Anfield. He died on 14 February 1996 at the age of 77, several weeks after moving into a nursing home in Merseyside.

Paisley was buried in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s Church in Woolton, Liverpool. A memorial to Paisley has been erected in the main park in his home town of Hetton-le-hole.

==Personal life==
Bob Paisley was married to his wife Jessie, a school teacher in Liverpool, from 1946 until his death 50 years later. They had two sons, Robert junior and Graham, and a daughter, Christine.

Jessie Paisley died in February 2012 at the age of 96. Jessie Paisley had attended the celebrations to commemorate Liverpool&#x27;s last game in front of the old Spion Kop terrace in 1994, but without her husband, who was not well enough to attend. Also in attendance that day were Paisley&#x27;s successor Joe Fagan, and Agnes &quot;Ness&quot; Shankly, the widow of his predecessor Bill Shankly.

<doc id="1142560" wikidata="Q42717" url="?curid=1142560" title="Arnold von Winkelried">
<text>Arnold von Winkelried or Arnold Winkelried was a legendary hero of Swiss history.
According to 16th-century Swiss historiography, Winkelried&#x27;s sacrifice brought about the victory of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the Battle of Sempach (1386) over the army of the Habsburg Duke Leopold III of Austria.

==The legend==

According to legend, the Swiss initially could not break the close ranks of the Habsburg pikemen. Winkelried cried: &quot;I will open a passage into the line; protect, dear countrymen and confederates, my wife and children...&quot; He then threw himself upon the Austrian pikes, taking some of them down with his body. This broke up the Austrian front, and made an opening through which the Swiss could attack.

As phrased in the Halbsuterlied printed in the 1530s by Aegidius Tschudi and Wernher Steiner:

Two other verses describe the order of battle of the Austrian side. 
According to this testimony, the knights dismounted, presumably because they were forced to fight from the lower ground, and they cut off their shoe-tips for better mobility. Even though they would have had a sufficient force of mercenaries to engage the outnumbered Swiss, the nobility wanted to engage the enemy on their own, because they were concerned that the mercenaries would make such short work of the peasants that they themselves would not see any action at all, which would have been to their dishonour:

This is given by means of explanation as to how the breaking of the first rank of pikes by Winkelried could lead to immediate disaster for the Austrian side, as the leaders of the army were fighting in the van.

Haller (&quot;Schweizerschlachten&quot;, 1828) reports that in the early 19th century, a pierced mail shirt identified as that worn by Winkelried in the battle was preserved in Stans. Haller also reports a folk tradition according to which Winkelried was found still alive after the battle, and only died of his wounds on the way home in a boat on Lake Sempach.

==Historicity==

The historicity of Winkelried and his deed has been taken for granted in 19th-century historiography, but in the 20th century it was commonly deconstructed as pure legend. Since the late 20th century, scholarship is again inclined to consider its historicity as plausible, even though no positive proof can be given to substantiate it.

The earliest record of the deed is in the Zürcher Chronik, a manuscript compiled in the 1480s based on older sources. The hero in this account is unnamed, identified just as &quot;ein getrüwer man under den Eidgenozen&quot; (a faithful man among the &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; (&quot;confederates&quot;)). 
In the chronicle of Diebold Schilling of Berne (c. 1480), in the picture of the battle of Sempach there is a warrior pierced with spears falling to the ground, which may possibly be meant to be Winkelried. In the chronicle of Diebold Schilling of Lucerne (1511), though in the text no allusion is made to any such incident, there is a similar picture of a man who has accomplished Winkelried&#x27;s feat, though he is dressed in the colours of Lucerne.

The name of Winkelried first appears in the 16th century. The hero is still nameless in &quot;De Helvetiae origine&quot; by Rudolph Gwalther (1538), but Aegidius Tschudi (1536) has &quot;a man of Unterwalden, of the Winkelried family,&quot; this being expanded in the final recension of the chronicle (1564) into &quot;a man of Unterwalden, Arnold von Winckelried by name, a brave knight,&quot;. He is entered (in the same book, on the authority of the &quot;Anniversary Book&quot; of Stans, now lost) on the list of those who fell at Sempach at the head of the Nidwalden (or Stans) men as &quot;Herr Arnold von Winckelriet, Ritter,&quot; this being in the first draft &quot;Arnold Winckelriet.&quot;

Some recensions of the &quot;Sempacherlied&quot;, which originally dates to about the time of the Burgundian Wars in the 1470s, do mention Winkelried, but these sections are mostly considered additions from the early 16th century, as in the additions by H. Berlinger of Basel to Etterlin&#x27;s chronicle (made between 1531 and 1545), or the version in Werner Steiner&#x27;s chronicle (1532). Also from the 16th century is evidence from lists of those who fell at Sempach; the &quot;Anniversary Book&quot; of Emmetten in Unterwalden (drawn up in 1560) has &quot;der Winkelriedt&quot; at the head of the Nidwalden men. A book by Horolanus, a pastor at Lucerne (about 1563), has &quot;Erni Winckelried&quot; some way down the list of Unterwalden men.

It thus appears that the legend may have originated by the 1430s, or at the latest the 1470s, that is within 50 or at the most 90 years of the battle, but the name of &quot;Winkelried&quot; was not associated with the hero before the 1530s or perhaps the 1520s, i.e. the time of the Swiss Reformation, more than 130 years after the battle.

The history of the Winkelried family of Stans has been minutely worked out from the original documents by Hermann von Liebenau in 1854. According to his research, they were a knightly family when we first hear of them about 1250, though towards the end of the 14th century they seem to have been but simple men without the honours of knighthood, and not always using their prefix &quot;von.&quot; Liebenau was the first to draw attention to one Erni Winkelried who signed as a witness on a document dated 1 May 1367.
This is the only candidate on record for a possible identification of Winkelried with an historical character. 
Liebenau supposes that because this Erni signed as the last of five witnesses, after one Hans Winkelried, he was presumably still a young man at this time, which would make him of mature age at the date of the battle.
He further reasons that the fact that this Erni is absent from record during the 1370s, while Hans is repeatedly seen as a witness, might indicate that during this time the young Erni was abroad in foreign service.

The same name Erni Winkelried however resurfaces on a document dated 29 September 1389, after the battle.
Liebenauer again notes how the Erni Winkelried of 1389 signs as the last of the three in his party, which again indicates that he was the youngest among them. Furthermore, an Arnold Winkelried is again attested as &quot;landamman&quot; of Unterwalden in 1417, it is clear that there were at least two people with this name, perhaps father and eldest son. The older Erni would then have been born around 1350, and the younger around 1370.

As for the plausibility of Winkelried&#x27;s deed, the single-handed breaking of a line of pikes to open a breach, which is then exploited to turn the course of the battle, a parallel is adduced by Liebenau is that of one Johann Stühlinger, a &quot;ministerialis&quot; in the service of Regensburg, who in a 1332 battle against Berne and Solothurn broke through the ranks of the enemy with his warhorse, creating just such an opening, which was exploited to the cost of 400 men on the Bernese side. 
The pikes (&quot;spiesse&quot;) of the Austrian knights in historical paintings are commonly depicted as the long pole weapons of the 15th-century pike square, but this is an anachronism. The pikes of the late 14th century would still have been considerably shorter. As according to the testimony of the Sempacherlied, the Austrian nobility insisted on fighting against the underestimated Swiss in the front rank, it would have been sufficient to break into just the van of the Austrian army to kill Leopold and other leaders of the army, which would have ended the battle immediately.

==Significance==
Similar to William Tell, the figure of Winkelried was an important symbol during the formation of the Swiss federal state, and an icon of Swiss independence during World War II. Napoleon referred to Winkelried as “the Swiss Decius immortalized” at Sempach.

Arnold Winkelried is also mentioned in &quot;Nature&quot; (1836) by Ralph Waldo Emerson and in &quot;The Maine Woods&quot; (1864) by Henry David Thoreau.
The &quot;Sempacherlied&quot; of ca. 1836, one of the expressions of Swiss patriotism during the period of Restoration, is dedicated to the heroism of Winkelried. The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges uses his name, among many other known Swiss, as a paradigm of the Swiss spirit in one of his late poems: &quot;Los Conjurados&quot; (The Conspirators), which also gives its name to the book.

There is a philosophy called &quot;&quot;, which name is taken from the hero&#x27;s name. It is based on an individual giving himself up idealistically and sacrificially to the enemy for the betterment of others. Juliusz Słowacki created this way of thinking in his dramatic poem &quot;Kordian&quot;, where the titular character decides to kill the Tsar of Russia to take Poland&#x27;s suffering on himself, easing a breakthrough to freedom for his nation. Słowacki considered Poland the &quot;Winkelried of Nations&quot;.

<text>The Division of Bowman is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The current MP is Henry Pike of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1949 and is named for David Bowman, an early leader of the Australian Labor Party, in Queensland. The seat consists of the entirety of Redland City, located in the eastern suburbs of Brisbane, and includes the suburbs of Capalaba, Cleveland, Redland Bay, Birkdale, Thorneside, Alexandra Hills, Thornlands, Mount Cotton, Ormiston, Wellington Point and Victoria Point. The division also incorporates various islands of Moreton Bay including Coochiemudlo Island, the inhabited southern Bay Islands (Russell, Karragarra, Macleay and Lamb) and the big tourist destination of North Stradbroke Island.

It is generally a residential electorate with some crops, poultry, various light industries and tourism.

Bowman has traditionally been a highly marginal seat, regularly changing hands between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party. Notably, the electorate has been won by the party with the largest national two party preferred vote at every election from 1954 to 2001 (except 1990). However, in the 2004 election, an energetic campaign by Dr Andrew Laming, and an electoral redistribution (due to the creation of the new Division of Bonner, leading veteran Bowman MP Con Sciacca to contest this new seat), saw Bowman returned to the Liberal Party by a significant margin (59.12% 2PP). The division was then considered by pollsters such as Antony Green to be a fairly safe Liberal seat.

In the 2007 election, the electorate experienced a strong swing of 8.86% towards the Australian Labor Party; the incumbent Laming held the seat by 0.04%, or 64 votes. This made it second only to McEwen as the most marginal seat in the country, although the 2009 electoral redistribution in Queensland saw the margin notionally reduced further, to effectively 0.005%, making Bowman Australia&#x27;s most marginal seat at the time. Laming went on to retain the seat comfortably for the Liberal National Party of Queensland in: 2010, regaining ground with a 9.51% swing towards him; 2013, despite a 6.35% swing against him; and 2016, when all parties saw a positive swing in Bowman (for the first time since 1955), due to the absence of a Palmer United Party candidate.

<doc id="1142563" wikidata="Q1673582" url="?curid=1142563" title="Isabella piercing">
<text>Isabella piercing is a female genital piercing. This extremely deep clitoral shaft piercing starts below the clitoris and just above the urethra, and then goes up through the clitoral shaft and exits at the top of the hood.

The Isabella piercing was first documented in issue 17 of &quot;Piercing World Magazine&quot;. As an Isabella piercing intersects the shaft of the clitoris, it is considered to be high risk for nerve damage and is therefore extremely rare. Like other female genital piercings, the Isabella piercing is anatomy-dependent. Nerve damage can result from piercing a clitoris that is too small or from piercing through the shaft of the clitoris and through the dorsal nerve. Piercing through the shaft of the clitoris can also result in excessive bleeding and blood loss to the clitoris. Healing time is 2-3 months. The Nefertiti piercing was invented in response to the inherent dangers involved with the Isabella piercing.

== Jewelry ==
Isabellas are usually pierced with custom made barbells usually in 16 to 14 gauge and in to in.

<text>The International Lenin Peace Prize (, &quot;mezhdunarodnaya Leninskaya premiya mira)&quot; was a Soviet Union award named in honor of Vladimir Lenin. It was awarded by a panel appointed by the Soviet government, to notable individuals whom the panel indicated had &quot;strengthened peace among comrades&quot;. It was founded as the International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples, but was renamed the International Lenin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples (, &quot;Mezhdunarodnaya Leninskaya premiya «Za ukrepleniye mira mezhdu narodami»&quot;) as a result of de-Stalinization. Unlike the Nobel Prize, the Lenin Peace Prize was usually awarded to several people a year rather than to just one individual. The prize was mainly awarded to prominent Communists and supporters of the Soviet Union who were not Soviet citizens. Notable recipients include W. E. B. Du Bois, Fidel Castro, Lázaro Cárdenas, Salvador Allende, Mikis Theodorakis, Seán MacBride, Angela Davis, Pablo Picasso, Oscar Niemeyer, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Abdul Sattar Edhi, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, CV Raman and Nelson Mandela.
==History==
The prize was created as the International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples on December 21, 1949, by &quot;executive order&quot; of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in honor of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s seventieth birthday (although this was after his seventy-first).

Following Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin in 1956 during the Twentieth Party Congress, the prize was renamed on September 6 as the International Lenin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples. All previous recipients were asked to return their Stalin Prizes so they could be replaced by the renamed Lenin Prize. By a decision of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of December 11, 1989, the prize was renamed the International Lenin Peace Prize. Two years later, after the collapse of USSR in 1991, the Russian government, as the successor state to the defunct Soviet Union, ended the award program. The Lenin Peace Prize is regarded as a counterpart to the existing Nobel Peace Prize.

The International Lenin Prize should not be confused with the International Peace Prize, awarded by the World Peace Council. In 1941 the Soviet Union created the Stalin Prize (later renamed the &quot;USSR State Prize&quot;), which was awarded annually to accomplished Soviet writers, composers, artists and scientists.

<doc id="1142572" wikidata="Q2584546" url="?curid=1142572" title="Winkelried">
<text>The Winkelried family was a Swiss noble family of Unterwalden, recorded as members of the lower nobility during the second half of the 13th century and as commoners during the 14th to early 16th centuries.
The name is mostly associated with Arnold von Winkelried, the hero of the Battle of Sempach (1386) in Swiss historiography.
Because of the importance of Arnold Winkelried in 19th-century Swiss nationalism, much research has gone into the genealogy of this family.

== History ==
Their origin was presumably in the territory of Ennetmoos in Nidwalden, where a toponym &quot;Wichried&quot; (&quot;Wychried&quot;, ) has survived into modern times.
The first recorded member of this family was the knight Rudolf von Winkelried, attested in a letter dated to the 1240s.
Heinrich von Winkelried was probably a son of Rudolf, als recorded as a knight and &quot;ministerialis&quot; of count Rudolf von Habsburg, between 1275 and 1303. 
Heinrich became connected him with a legend of a dragon fight, first recorded by Etterlin (1507).
Abbot Rudolf I of Engelberg who lived during the same period may also have been a member of the family.

After Heinrich, the Winkelrieds lose their distinction as noblemen. People bearing the name Winkelried are recorded as mostly prosperous commoners during the 14th and 15th centuries. These later Winkelrieds may reflect their origin among the nobility by keeping a coat of arms (displaying a crescent in a triangle). A Jacob von Winkelried is recorded in 1343 as owning property in Ennetmoos, in 1372 a Peter Winkelried is the tenant of the possessions of Engelberg in Alpnach. 
In the 1382 uprising against the noble families in Unterwalden, the Winkelrieds seem to be affected because of their close connections to the aristocracy.
In a document dated 1 May 1367, one of the witnesses signs as Erni Winkelried. This is the only candidate on record for the historicity of Arnold Winkelried of patriotic legend. The first mention of Winkelried as the hero of Sempach dates to nearly a century later, in the time of the Burgundian Wars.

But a man called Erni Winkelried is recorded again on 29 September 1389 and on 13 March 1396, after the battle where he supposedly died a hero&#x27;s death. But yet another Erni Winkelried appears in 1417 and 1418 as &quot;amtmann&quot; of Nidwalden, so that there was clearly more than one person with this name, perhaps father and son. 

Yet another Arnold Winkelried is recorded in the second half of the 15th century, in connection of a lawsuit of November 1474 and as delegate of Nidwalden at the Swiss Diet on several occasions during 1476 to 1482.
A Heinrich Winkelried recorded from 1456 was a member of the council of Nidwalden from before 1471 and delegate at the Diet during 1469 to 1498.

A fourth Arnold Winkelried is recorded as delegate from 1496 to 1507.
He was also a member of a Swiss delegation sent to emperor Maximilian in 1508 and as a captain in the battle of Novara in 1513.
This Arnold is last recorded in 1524.
Yet another Arnold Winkelried, sometimes conflated with the aforementioned, was a notorious mercenary leader during the first quarter of the 16th century. He was knighted in 1514 by the Milanese duke Maximilian Sforza.
On 13 September he was instigated by cardinal Schiner to engage in a skirmish with the French men-at-arms outside of Milano, thus causing the disastrous Battle of Marignano. In 1516 he marched against Milano in the Service of Maximilian, and defended Verona against the French.
After the treaty of May 1517, Winkelried threatened to declare war on the king of France (who now also was the duke of Milan) privately because of the unpaid wages still owed by Sforza, the previous duke. 
After this dispute had been settled to his satisfaction, he entered French service in 1518 and participated in the 1521 campaign in Picardy in the rank of captain. In 1522, he commanded 16,000 Swiss mercenaries in French service invading Lombardy. 
At Bicocca he met with his former commander Georg von Frundsberg, who served on the imperial side.
The two mercenary leaders engaged in single combat, and Winkelried was killed. It was later disputed among the Swiss serving on either side whether Winkelried had been killed by Frundsberg or whether he had been shot from the flank.
Because the death of this Arnold Winkelried immediately predates the earliest printed references to the legendary hero of Sempach, some historians have suggested that the chroniclers of the early 16th century named the previously unnamed hero after the mercenary leader.

A son of Arnold&#x27;s, Hans Winkelreid, died before 1532, and the name seems to have been extinct by 1550.

<text>Nigella damascena, love-in-a-mist, or devil in the bush, is an annual garden flowering plant, belonging to the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. 
It is native to southern Europe (but adventive in more northern countries of Europe), north Africa and southwest Asia, where it is found on neglected, damp patches of land.

The specific epithet &quot;damascena&quot; relates to Damascus in Syria. The plant&#x27;s common name &quot;love-in-a-mist&quot; comes from the flower being nestled in a ring of , lacy bracts.

==Description==
It grows to tall, with pinnately divided, thread-like, alternate leaves. The flowers, blooming in early summer, are most commonly different shades of blue, but can be white, pink, or pale purple, with 5 to 25 sepals. The actual petals are located at the base of the stamens and are minute and clawed. The sepals are the only colored part of the perianth. The four to five carpels of the compound pistil have each an erect style.

The fruit is a large and inflated capsule, growing from a compound ovary, and is composed of several united follicles, each containing numerous seeds. This is rather exceptional for a member of the buttercup family. The capsule becomes brown in late summer. The plant self-seeds, growing on the same spot year after year. 
==Cultivation==

This easily grown plant has been a familiar subject in English cottage gardens since Elizabethan times, admired for its ferny foliage, spiky flowers and bulbous seed-heads. It is now widely cultivated throughout the temperate world, and numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use. &#x27;Persian Jewels&#x27; is a mixture of white, pink, lavender and blue flowers. &#x27;Persian Rose&#x27; is pale pink. Other cultivars are &#x27;Albion&#x27;, &#x27;Blue Midget&#x27;, &#x27;Cambridge Blue&#x27;, &#x27;Mulberry Rose&#x27;, and &#x27;Oxford Blue&#x27;. &#x27;Dwarf Moody Blue&#x27; is around high. The pale blue ‘Miss Jekyll’ and the double white-flowered &#x27;Miss Jekyll Alba&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Related species==
The related &quot;Nigella sativa&quot; (and not &quot;N. damascena&quot;) is the source of the spice variously known as nigella, &quot;kalonji&quot; or black cumin.

==Alkaloids==
Damascenine is a toxic alkaloid found in &quot;Nigella damascena&quot; seed.

However, an in vivo study in mice and in vitro assessment on human cell lines has not shown any toxicity.

<text>Southwest Cay, also known as ; Pugad Island (); Mandarin , is an island on the northwestern edge of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. It is part of the atoll North Danger Reef, and just southwest of Northeast Cay. With an area of , it is the sixth largest of the naturally occurring Spratly Islands, and the second largest of the Vietnamese-occupied islands. Southwest Cay has the archipelago&#x27;s highest point, at 4 meters above sea level. It was once a breeding place for birds, and was covered with trees and guano; export of guano had been carried out &quot;on a considerable scale&quot;.

The island is also claimed by China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC), and the Philippines.

==History==
===1933 – French possession===
In 1933, the French Government took possession of the Spratly Islands including Southwest Cay and Northeast Cay. Three ships, the &quot;Alerte&quot;, the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and the &quot;De Lanessan&quot; took part in the expedition. The following quotations are from an account given by H. Cucherousset in &quot;L&#x27;Eveil economique de l&#x27;Indochine&quot; (No. 790 of May 28, 1933):

:&quot;Further north still, at the level of Nha Trang, is the atoll named &quot;North Danger&quot;, the &quot;Alerte&quot; took possession of two sandy islands (cayes) where it found some Japanese fishing. The &quot;De Lanessan&quot; went there too and explored the little island. The latter is perceptibly higher than the others, the highest point reaching 5 metres. The phosphate beds are considerable and were much exploited by the Japanese.&quot;

After possession had been taken, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs published the following notice in the French &quot;Journal Officiel&quot; dated 26 July 1933 (page 7837):
:&quot;Notice concerning the occupation of certain islands by French naval units.

:The French government has caused the under mentioned isles and islets to be occupied by French naval units:
:Group of two islands situated at latitude 111°29&#x27; north and longitude 114°21&#x27; east of Greenwich, with their dependent isles (36) (Possession taken April 10, 1933).

:The above-mentioned isles and islets henceforward come under French sovereignty (this notice cancels the previous notice inserted in the Official Journal dated July 25, 1933, page 7784).&quot;

===1939–1945 – Japanese occupation===
In 1939, Japan occupied the islands and remained there until the end of World War II.

===1956 – Transfer to South Vietnam===

In 1956, France transferred the islands to South Vietnam.

In 1959, the South Vietnamese Government renamed the Song Tử islands (meaning twins after their resemblance to each other) &quot;Tây&quot; (meaning West) and &quot;Đông&quot; (meaning East) respectively. They were annexed to Phước Tuy Province, South Vietnam.

In 1961, the two South Vietnam Navy cruisers, the &quot;Van Kiep&quot; and the &quot;Van Don&quot;, landed on the islands of Song Tử Tây (Southwest Cay).

On May 24, 1963, the sovereignty steles were rebuilt on Song Tử Đông (Northeast Cay) and Song Tử Tây (Southwest Cay) by crew members of the three vessels &quot;Huong Giang&quot;, &quot;Chi Lang&quot; and &quot;Ky Hoa&quot; of South Vietnam.

===1968 – Philippine occupation===
In 1968, Filipino troops occupied Song Tử Đông (Northeast Cay, Parola) and Song Tử Tây (Southwest Cay, Pugad). &quot;As this relates to Cloma, no official act by the Philippine government could be found which contemporaneously and specifically ratified his declaration. However, in 1968 the Philippine government began sending troops to occupy the area and in 1971 made an official announcement that the Philippines were occupying several of the features in KIG for “reasons of national security and to “protect the interests of the state and its citizens.” 

===1975 – Capture by South Vietnam===
Southwest Cay is near the northern edge of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. It is just northwest of Dangerous Ground in the North Danger Reef group, which also contains the Filipino-occupied Northeast Cay (Parola), the South Vietnamese-occupied South Reef, and the unoccupied North Reef. Southwest Cay and Northeast Cay are just 1.75 miles (2.82 km) apart, and each island is visible from the other.

Sometime in 1975, all the Filipino soldiers guarding Southwest Cay (Pugad) left to attend to the birthday party of their commanding officer who was based on Northeast Cay (Parola). A storm that day is also believed to have influenced the soldiers to regroup temporarily on Parola. A report also came out saying that South Vietnamese officials managed to send prostitutes to the birthday party to lure the Filipino soldiers guarding Pugad. It was said to be a &quot;present&quot; to the Filipino commander for his birthday, and as a move of South Vietnamese forces to befriend all Filipino soldiers guarding the Spratlys. Filipino soldiers did not expect that South Vietnam would resort to foul play since both the Philippines and South Vietnam, together with the United States, were allies in the Vietnam War. This tactic is believed to be the reason why South Vietnamese forces knew that the Filipino soldiers left the island, an action that is usually kept confidential.

After the party and after the weather cleared out, the returning soldiers were surprised that a company of South Vietnamese soldiers were already on the island. The South Vietnamese flag replaced the Filipino flag flying on the pole erected by Filipino soldiers. The Filipino soldiers returned to Parola immediately for fear that Parola would be the next target. After higher-ups of the Philippines were informed about the situation, they instructed the troops based in Parola and Pagasa (Thitu Island) to stay on red alert status. For the following mornings, the only thing the Filipino soldiers could do on Parola was to &quot;curse&quot; while South Vietnamese soldiers on Pugad sang their national anthem. Malacañang officials, who did not want to compromise the alliance while the Vietnam War was still being fought, decided to remain silent.

===1975 – Vietnam reunification===
A few months later, the recently unified Vietnam (after North Vietnam won over South Vietnam, the North Vietnam task force occupied the island) decided to remove all remaining South Vietnamese troops in the Spratly Islands and establish military control among the features. It was reported that dozens of South Vietnamese soldiers in Southwest Cay (Song Tử Tây) swam all the way to Northeast Cay (Parola) just to avoid being captured by North Vietnamese forces. It was then when Malacañang officials, headed by President Ferdinand Marcos, discussed how the Philippines would reclaim the island. It had been apparent that most of the officials, who considered the North Vietnamese communists to be a threat to Filipino national security, wanted to attack Southwest Cay (Pugad) to reclaim it. However, after an intelligence report came stating that the unified Vietnam had already built a huge concrete garrison within a few weeks, the officials dropped the plan and tried to resolve the issue diplomatically. However, this approach eventually died along the process making Southwest Cay (Song Tử Tây) a Vietnamese-occupied island up to this day. This incident was confirmed in interviews with soldiers involved in an episode of the defunct &quot;Magandang Gabi, Bayan&quot; of ABS-CBN.

Although Vietnam, China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC), and the Philippines all claim the island, no clashes have been reported since 1975. The island currently hosts periodic joint exercises and sporting activities between the Vietnamese and Philippine militaries.

<doc id="1142581" wikidata="Q1575672" url="?curid=1142581" title="Magnificent Seven cemeteries">
<text>The Magnificent Seven is an informal term applied to seven large private cemeteries in London. These are Kensal Green Cemetery, West Norwood Cemetery, Highgate Cemetery, Abney Park Cemetery, Brompton Cemetery, Nunhead Cemetery, and Tower Hamlets Cemetery. They were established in the 19th century to alleviate overcrowding in existing parish burial grounds as London’s population grew during the Victorian era. In 1981, the architectural historian Hugh Meller dubbed the group of cemeteries &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; after the 1960 western film of the same name.

==History==

===Background===
For hundreds of years, almost all London&#x27;s dead were buried in small parish churchyards, which became dangerously overcrowded. Architects such as Sir Christopher Wren and Sir John Vanbrugh deplored this practice and wished to see suburban cemeteries established. It was not until British visitors to Paris, including George Frederick Carden, were inspired by its Père Lachaise cemetery that sufficient time and money were devoted to canvass for reform, and equivalents were developed in London, firstly at Kensal Green.

In the first 50 years of the 19th century, the population of London more than doubled, from 1 million to 2.3 million. Overcrowded graveyards also led to decaying matter getting into the water supply and causing epidemics. There were incidents of graves being dug on unmarked plots that already contained bodies, and of bodies being defiled by sewer rats infiltrating the churchyards&#x27; drains from the relatively central Tyburn, Fleet, Effra and Westbourne rivers which were used as foul sewers by this date and later wholly discharged into London&#x27;s outfall sewers.

===Establishment===
In 1832, Parliament passed an act encouraging the establishment of private cemeteries outside central London. Over the next decade seven cemeteries were established, at least four of which were consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London.

The Burial Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. 85) section 9 required new burial grounds in a list of urban parishes of London (the Metropolis) to be approved by the Secretary of State. Sections 1 and 44 enabled the Secretary of State to close metropolitan London churchyards to new interments and make regulations regarding proper burial. The expenses for establishing burial boards to accommodate these changes were ordered to come from the poor rates under section 19. Sections 26 and 28 of that act enabled parish Burial Boards (with vestry approval) to purchase land anywhere and to appropriate land belonging to the relevant parish, poor board or any of its charitable trusts.

For a time following the establishment of the cemeteries, it became a semi-established custom for visitors to the cemeteries to picnic among the graves; their suburban locations made them especially popular.

<doc id="1142590" wikidata="Q917665" url="?curid=1142590" title="Division of Brisbane">
<text>The Division of Brisbane is an Australian electoral division in the state of Queensland.

==History==

The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It is named after the city of Brisbane.

It was in Labor hands for all but five years from 1931 to 2010, and for most of that time was a marginal Labor seat. However, a redistribution ahead of the 2010 election pushed the seat into more conservative-leaning territory east of Breakfast Creek. This helped Liberal Party challenger Teresa Gambaro take the seat from Labor incumbent Arch Bevis, marking the first time in over a century that Labor had been in government without holding Brisbane. She was re-elected in 2013 with an increased majority.

Gambaro did not re-contest the seat at the 2016 election. The contest was historic in that it was the first Australian federal election where both major party candidates in a lower house seat contest were openly gay – Trevor Evans for the Liberal Nationals and Pat O&#x27;Neill for Labor. Evans retained the seat for the LNP. Evans was re-elected in 2019 despite being the only incumbent Liberal National MP to suffer a swing against them at that election.

The seat of Brisbane has a growing Greens vote, with the party being only 2.12% short of overtaking the Labor Party on primary vote and thus likely entering the two-party preferred vote. The Greens won 2 booths at the 2019 federal election (Kelvin Grove and Spring Hill) and came second in a further 9 booths. The increase in the Greens vote in Brisbane has come largely at the expense of the Labor Party, with their vote having dropped by 22.47% from 1993, when the Greens first contested Brisbane, to 2019, where the Greens received 22.37% of the overall vote. In the 2022 federal election, Greens candidate Stephen Bates won the seat. The party also won the neighbouring divisions of Ryan and Griffith.

==Boundaries==
On its original boundaries, Brisbane covered all of what is now the northern part of the City of Brisbane, but successive boundary changes cut it back to the inner suburban area. However, between 1913 and 1949 the seat instead covered the inner south-west.

Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

It now extends from the city centre into the western suburbs, and includes the Brisbane CBD, Alderley, Ashgrove, Bowen Hills, Clayfield, Enoggera, Ferny Grove, Fortitude Valley, Gaythorne, Grange, Herston, Kelvin Grove, Keperra, Milton, Mitchelton, New Farm, Newmarket, Newstead, Teneriffe, Red Hill, Spring Hill, Upper Kedron, Wilston, Windsor, Gordon Park, Wooloowin, Lutwyche, parts of Bardon, Everton Park, Paddington and Stafford.

In the 2009 redistribution announced by the Australian Electoral Commission, the suburbs of Hendra, Ascot and Hamilton were included in the seat of Brisbane.

<text>Konrad Grob (3 September 1828 – 9 January 1904) was a Swiss painter.

He was born in Andelfingen in the Canton of Zurich and learned lithography in the 1840s in Winterthur. He travelled to Italy, where he worked in Verona and Naples.

In 1865–1870, he studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich where he graduated under Arthur von Ramberg. In Munich, he opened his own atelier and where he died in. He specialized in romantic paintings of rural life. His best-known painting is &quot;Pestalozzi bei den Waisen von Stans&quot;, shown today in the &quot;Öffentliche Kunstsammlung&quot; (the Museum of Art) of Basel.

<doc id="1142602" wikidata="Q687440" url="?curid=1142602" title="Grumman XF10F Jaguar">
<text>The Grumman XF10F Jaguar was a prototype swing-wing fighter aircraft offered to the United States Navy in the early 1950s. Although it never entered service, its research paved the way toward the later General Dynamics F-111 and Grumman&#x27;s own F-14 Tomcat.

==Design and development==
The Navy&#x27;s interest in the variable-geometry wing was based on concerns that the ever-increasing weight of its jet fighters was making aircraft carrier operations troublesome. Many of its existing aircraft already had marginal carrier performance, and the trend in weight growth was obviously upward. At the same time, the demands for high-speed performance demanded swept wing layouts that did not lend themselves to good takeoff characteristics. The prospect of combining the two in a single aircraft was enticing.

Originally conceived as a swept-wing version of the earlier F9F Panther, in February–March 1948, the design was reconfigured with a T-tail and ultimately a variable-geometry wing. It featured a T-tail, with the horizontal stabilator, a small pivoting center body with a delta servo control at the nose and a larger rear delta main wing, mounted atop the vertical fin. The single turbojet engine was fed by cheek intakes. The high, shoulder-mounted wing could be moved to two positions: a 13.5° sweep for takeoff and landing and a 42.5° sweep for high-speed flight.

The unique horizontal stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small foreplane was directly controlled by the pilot and pulled the stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish pitch control, increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small foreplane was lessened, and if the project had developed further, it probably would have been replaced by a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of leading edge slats causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.

The XF10F-1 was not armed, but production aircraft would likely have had four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and pylons for bombs and rockets, like other contemporary Navy fighters.

==Testing==
The Jaguar&#x27;s configuration presented many of the same handling problems as the earlier Bell X-5 experimental aircraft, with some vicious spin characteristics.

The Jaguar&#x27;s development was hampered by its use of the chronically unreliable Westinghouse J40 turbojet, which, as on other aircraft of this period, made the Jaguar dangerously underpowered and prone to various engine-related problems. The J40 developed only 6,800 lbf (30.2 kN) thrust rather than the anticipated 11,000 lbf (49 kN), and its troubles ultimately proved to be insurmountable.

Test pilot Corwin &quot;Corky&quot; Meyer, the only pilot to fly the Jaguar, described it as entertaining to fly &quot;because there was so much wrong with it.&quot;
Examples of the &quot;wrongness&quot; encountered by Meyer during the test flight program included:
*Jamming of the wing sweep mechanism as hydraulic fluid congealed into a gelatinous state from poor maintenance, resulting in a substance with &quot;a consistency of Jell-O&quot;. Despite this failure, the aerodynamicist&#x27;s assertion that the wing would unsweep itself in case of a mechanical failure proved entirely correct, to Meyer&#x27;s relief.
*Regular inflight failures of the equally experimental Westinghouse XJ-40 turbojet. The reason for its unreliability within the Jaguar was traced ultimately to an extraordinary case of sloppy manufacture; an engine electronics box access panel had a screw nearly 5 in (127 mm) long mangling the delicate circuits within, in sharp contrast to the other three panel screws which were barely .4 in (10 mm) long.
*The &quot;aerodynamically balanced&quot; canard-actuated pendulum elevator, whose ineffectiveness and poor contribution to stability was already apparent in free-flight development models. The instability was dismissed as a &quot;model effect&quot;, but this proved to be a fallacious judgement. Initial fixes consisted of a set of triangular horizontal fins on the rear fuselage, but ultimately Grumman admitted defeat and retroactively fitted the horizontal surfaces from the earlier Grumman F-9 Cougar swept-wing fighter. By this time the program was nearing its end, and it was at this stage unlikely that the U.S. Navy would adopt the Jaguar.
*During a flight the canopy opened and could not be closed, nor could it be ejected. At the same time, the less-than-trustworthy engine began losing power at an alarming rate, but, due to the problems with the canopy, Corky Meyer could not eject. He did manage to land safely. It was just after this flight that the aforementioned grossly oversized screw was found.

He found the translating wing-sweep mechanism, similar to the Bell X-5&#x27;s, (which was much more complicated than the one later adopted by the F-111, F-14 and Panavia Tornado &quot;et al.&quot;), to be the only feature that worked flawlessly. The Navy was not encouraged by the results, and the development of larger carriers with angled flight decks and steam-driven catapults made the swing-wing configuration unnecessary.

The prototype XF10F-1 first flew on 19 May 1952. It was used for some 32 test flights throughout the year, but in April 1953, the Navy canceled the program, and with it, the 112 production aircraft that had been ordered. The sole flying aircraft and the uncompleted second prototype were shipped to Naval Air Material Center in Philadelphia for barricade testing, and the static test aircraft was later used as a gunnery target.

<text>The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was a record breaking, devastating and deadly Atlantic hurricane season which became the second most active on record in terms of number of tropical cyclones, just behind the 2020 season. It is the second-costliest hurricane season, just behind the 2017 season. It featured 28 tropical and subtropical storms. The United States National Hurricane Center named 27 storms, exhausting the annual pre-designated list, requiring the use of six Greek letter names, and adding an additional unnamed subtropical storm during a post-season re-analysis. A record 15 storms attained hurricane status, with maximum sustained winds of at least . Of those, a record seven became major hurricanes, rated Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Four storms of this season became Category 5 hurricanes, the most of any season on record.

The four Category 5 hurricanes during the season were: Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. In July, Emily reached peak intensity in the Caribbean Sea, becoming the first Category 5 hurricane of the season, later weakening and striking Mexico twice. It was the first Category 5 hurricane recorded in the month of July and was the earliest-forming Category 5 hurricane on record, until Hurricane Beryl surpassed the record in July 2024. In August, Katrina reached peak winds in the Gulf of Mexico but weakened by the time it struck the U.S. states of Louisiana and Mississippi. The most devastating effects of the season were felt on the Gulf Coast of the United States, where Katrina&#x27;s storm surge crippled New Orleans, Louisiana, for weeks and devastated the Mississippi coastline. Katrina became the costliest U.S. hurricane, leaving $125 billion in damage and 1,392 deaths. Rita followed in September, reaching peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico before weakening and hitting near the border of Texas and Louisiana. The season&#x27;s strongest hurricane, Wilma, became the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by barometric pressure. Lasting for ten days in October, Wilma moved over Cozumel, the Yucatán Peninsula, and Florida, causing over $22 billion in damage and 52 deaths.

The season&#x27;s impact was widespread and catastrophic. Its storms caused an estimated 3,468 deaths and approximately $171.7 billion in damage. It was the costliest season on record at the time, until its record was surpassed 12 years later. It also produced the second-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the Atlantic basin, only behind the 1933 season. The season officially began on June 1, 2005, and the first storm – Arlene – developed on June 8. Hurricane Dennis in July inflicted heavy damage to Cuba. Hurricane Stan in October was part of a broader weather system that killed 1,673 people and caused $3.96 billion in damage to eastern Mexico and Central America, with Guatemala hit the hardest. The final storm – Zeta – formed in late December and lasted until January 6, 2006 – the latest of any season, tied with 1954–55.

==Seasonal forecasts==

Ahead of the formal start of the season, various groups issued forecasts for the number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes in the upcoming season, including Colorado State University (CSU), the Cuban Institute of Meteorology (InsMet), Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Some forecasts predicted how many tropical cyclones would affect a particular country or territory.

===Pre-season forecasts===
The first of these forecasts was issued by CSU, which predicted on December 5, 2004 that the season would be above average and feature 11 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 intense hurricanes. They also noted that the Caribbean and the entire United States coastline faced an increased risk of a major hurricane making landfall. TSR issued its first forecast a few days later and predicted that the season would feature 9.6 tropical storms, 5.7 hurricanes, 3.3 major hurricanes, and predicted that the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating would be 145.

During January 2005, TSR increased its forecast to 13.9 tropical storms, 7.8 hurricanes, 3.6 major hurricanes, and predicted that the ACE rating would be 157. CSU issued its first updated forecast on April 1, increasing their prediction to 13 tropical storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, with a continued risk of a major hurricane landfall in the Caribbean or United States. The increase was based on the Atlantic continuing to warm and a strong belief that El Niño conditions would not persist into the hurricane season. On May 2, the Cuban Institute of Meteorology (InsMet) issued their seasonal forecast, which predicted that the season would feature 13 tropical storms and 7 hurricanes. This was followed on May 16 by NOAA, who predicted a 70% chance of above normal activity, with 12–15 tropical storms, 7–9 hurricanes, and 3–5 major hurricanes. CSU issued its second forecast update on May 31, revising its forecast to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes; by this point, the group believed El Niño conditions were unlikely.

===Midseason outlooks===
In their July forecast update, TSR anticipated that the season would be exceptionally active and well above average; the group increased their forecast to 15.3 tropical storms, 8.8 hurricanes, and 4.1 major hurricanes, with an ACE rating of 190. By the end of July, seven tropical storms and two major hurricanes had developed within the basin, which prompted CSU, InsMet, NOAA and TSR to significantly increase their seasonal forecasts at the start of August. In their August 5 update, CSU predicted that 13 more storms would form, with seven more hurricanes and three more major hurricanes. At the start of September, CSU updated their forecasts and predicted that eight more storms would form, with six more hurricanes and three major hurricanes. By the end of September, 17 named storms had developed, of which nine had developed into hurricanes and four had become major hurricanes. Within their final update for the year, CSU predicted that October would feature three named storms, two hurricanes and one major hurricane.

==Seasonal summary==
=== Background ===
With 28 storms (27 named storms and one unnamed), the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season set a new single-year record for most storms, surpassing the total of 20 from 1933. This record stood until surpassed by the 2020 season, which had 30 storms. A total of 7 named storms formed before August 1, which exceeded the record of 5 set in 1997; this record stood until 2020. The fourth named storm developed at a then-record early date, surpassed in 2012. The fifth though eleventh and the thirteenth and onward named storms developed at then-record early dates that were later surpassed in 2020. Further, the months of July and November set records for number of named storms, with 5 and 3, respectively. The 2005 season featured 15 hurricanes, surpassing the previous record of 12, set in 1969.
Of the 15 hurricanes, 5 formed in September, with the season becoming only the sixth to feature 5 in that month. The 2005 season also featured a record seven major hurricanes, one more than the previous record, set in 1926, 1933, 1950, 1996, and 2004. The four Category 5 hurricanes were also a record. The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an ACE rating of 250, the second-highest value on record in the Atlantic basin, after the 1933 season.

The extremely active 2005 hurricane season was a continuation of an extended sequence of active years for tropical activity in the Atlantic. Tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic Ocean between 1995 and 2004 was more active than any other decade in reliable record. With the exception of two years in which El Niño conditions were prevalent (1997 and 2002), all hurricane seasons were individually above average. This was associated with an active phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), with a similar period of elevated tropical activity occurring between 1950 and 1969. The anomalously frequent formation of tropical storms and hurricanes reflected the emergence of unusually warm sea surface temperatures across the tropical Atlantic. The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicted in May 2005 that the conditions associated with this active multi-decadal signal would continue into the 2005 hurricane season, providing favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis in the tropical Atlantic.

===Record activity===

Chylek and Lesins (2008) determined that the likelihood of a season generating as much tropical activity as 2005 was less than 1 percent. The consecutive occurrence of hurricane seasons as active as 2004 and 2005 in the Atlantic was unprecedented. While environmental conditions favorable for the development of tropical cyclones were analogous to other active seasons, they were more pronounced and encompassed larger areas in 2005. The CPC determined that this environmental enhancement was primarily driven by four factors: the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, the reduction of atmospheric convection in the tropical Pacific, record-high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean, and conducive wind and pressure patterns across the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The multidecadal oscillation increased the potency of conducive environmental factors for tropical development, including the increased strength of subtropical ridges in the northern and southern Atlantic and the eastern Pacific. This amplified the African easterly jet and enhanced upper-level easterlies, attenuating wind shear detrimental to tropical cyclogenesis across the central tropical Atlantic and the Caribbean. Frequent lulls in convection over the tropical Pacific also contributed to the strength of these ridges, focusing hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Most of the tropical storms and all major hurricanes in the Atlantic in 2005 formed when a lack of convection was present near the International Dateline, while a brief uptick in storms near the International Dateline led to a lull in tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic for the first half of August.

The Gulf of Mexico saw record levels of tropical activity in 2005, with 11 named storms entering the basin. The unusual activity was attributed to a persistent high pressure area over the Southeastern United States, the northeastward displacement and amplification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the eastern Pacific, and above average sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. These factors reduced vertical wind shear and favored cyclonic flow, creating an environment highly supportive of tropical development. The high pressure area also steered incoming storms into the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a neutral phase, lowering the likelihood of storms making landfall on the East Coast of the United States and leading to a concentration of impacts farther west. This focusing mechanism led to a complementary reduction in storms developing close to Cape Verde. During the peak of the 2005 season, the Loop Current – an ocean current that transports warm water from the Caribbean Sea northward into the Gulf of Mexico and offshore the U.S. East Coast – propagated northward, reaching its most poleward point in advance of Hurricane Katrina. This protrusion detached into a warm core ring, or a small region of warm waters to an abnormally deep depth, and began to drift southwest as Hurricane Rita traversed the region. By mid-October, the Loop Current returned to its typical position in the Yucatán Peninsula. This evolution provided enhanced ocean heat content to both hurricanes and was partially responsible for the extreme intensities attained by those cyclones.

In addition to the unusually high amount of tropical activity, the 2005 season also featured an abnormally high amount of storms in the typically inactive early and latter parts of the season. Lowered sea-level atmospheric pressures in the late spring and early summer of 2005 curtailed the strength of trade winds, resulting in a reduction of latent heat loss from the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean. This allowed the persistence of the anomalously warm sea surface temperatures that had contributed to the active 2004 hurricane season; this warmth remained until November 2005. The activity in later parts of the 2005 season was elevated by the unusual development of four tropical cyclones from non-tropical origins over the eastern Atlantic.

In the wake of the season, questions arose regarding the potential impact of global warming on Atlantic hurricane activity. Hurricane experts noted that establishing a conclusive relationship would be difficult given the significant role that natural variability plays on hurricane formation and significantly improved tropical cyclone detection methods compared to decades past. A series of international workshops were established after 2005. After five years of analysis, researchers were unable to confirm whether the recent increase in tropical cyclone activity could be attributed more to climate change than natural variability. Models developed within the workshops projected that the number of tropical cyclones under Category 3 intensity would fall over the 21st century, while the number of intense Category 4–5 hurricanes would increase significantly. One potential hypothesis for these findings was a projected increase in vertical wind shear contradicted by warmer ocean temperatures for hurricanes to utilize. The team also concluded that the amount of precipitation produced by tropical cyclones would increase over the next century. In May 2020, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Wisconsin at Madison built upon this research and, for the first time, established a statistically significant global trend toward more intense tropical cyclones, particularly in the Atlantic basin. The research not only reaffirmed a trend toward stronger, wetter tropical cyclones, but it also identified a trend toward increased rapid intensification events and a general slowing of tropical cyclones&#x27; forward motion near land.

=== Impacts ===

The storms of the season were extraordinarily damaging and were responsible for significant loss of life. Total damage is estimated to be about US$171.7 billion, and the seasons&#x27; storms contributed to the deaths of 3,912 people. There were a record 15 storms making landfall, including seven storms that struck the United States.

The hardest-hit area was the United States Gulf Coast from eastern Texas to Florida, affected to varying degrees by Arlene, Cindy, Dennis, Katrina, Ophelia, Rita, Tammy, and Wilma. Dennis left $2.23 billion in damage along the Florida Panhandle. Katrina caused catastrophic damage to the Gulf Coast, devastating a long stretch of coast along Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama with a storm surge. Wind damage was reported well inland, slowing down recovery efforts. Storm surge also breached levees in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, flooding about 80% of the city. Total damage has been estimated at $125 billion, making Katrina the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, surpassing Andrew in 1992 and tying Harvey in 2017. At least 1,392 people were killed by the storm, making it the deadliest hurricane in the U.S. since 1928. Southeastern North Carolina suffered some damage from the slow-moving Ophelia. Rita struck near the border of Louisiana and Texas. The hurricane re-flooded New Orleans (though to a far less degree than Katrina), and caused about $18.5 billion in damage. Wilma caused about $19 billion in damage when it moved across southern Florida in October. The hurricane contributed to 30 deaths, five of whom were killed directly by the storm.

Three hurricanes struck Mexico – Emily, Stan, and Wilma. Emily struck Quintana Roo and Tamaulipas as a major hurricane, causing US$343 million ($3.4 billion MXN) in damage. Stan killed 80 people in Mexico, and damage in the county was estimated at US$1.2 billion ($13.2 billion MXN). Stan was part of a broader weather system across Central America that killed 1,513 people in Guatemala, where damage was estimated at US$996 million. Wilma dropped historic rainfall while drifting across the Yucatán peninsula. It killed four people in the country and left US$454 million ($4.8 billion MXN) in damage.

In the Caribbean, Cuba suffered the effects of Dennis and Wilma. The former killed 16 people and left US$1.4 billion in damage when it struck Cuba twice. Later, Wilma flooded parts of western Cuba, leaving US$704 million in damage. The island of Hispaniola experienced Dennis in July, which killed 56 people in Haiti. Emily killed one person and left US$111 million in damage when it struck Grenada, and later it killed five people on Jamaica. Collectively, Dennis and Emily caused about US$96 million (J$6 billion) in damage to Jamaica. Wilma killed 12 people in Haiti and one in Jamaica. Alpha killed 26 people in the Caribbean. In Central America, Beta killed nine people and caused US$11.5 million in damage when it struck Nicaragua in October. In November, Tropical Storm Gamma killed two people in Bequia in the Grenadines, 34 people in Honduras, and 3 in Belize.

Unusual impacts were felt in Europe and nearby islands. The remnants of Maria caused a landslide in Norway that killed three people. The unnamed subtropical storm in October moved through the Azores. Also in October, Vince became the first recorded tropical cyclone to strike Spain, making landfall at tropical depression intensity. In November, the extratropical remnants of Delta struck the Canary Islands, causing 7 fatalities, with 12 people missing.
==Systems==
===Tropical Storm Arlene===
The season&#x27;s first tropical depression developed north of Honduras on June 8 from the interaction of the ITCZ and a series of tropical waves. A day later it intensified into Tropical Storm Arlene while taking a northward track. On June 10, Arlene struck western Cuba. The storm intensified further in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of early on June 11. Later that day, the storm moved ashore just west of Pensacola, Florida. Over the next two days, Arlene continued northward through the United States, dissipating over southeastern Canada on June 14.

In western Cuba, Arlene produced wind gusts of at Punta del Este and of rainfall in the city of Pinar del Río. Arlene left mostly minor damage throughout the United States, estimated at $11.8 million. Storm surge damaged coastal roads in the Florida Panhandle and Alabama. In Miami Beach, Florida, a student died when she was caught in a rip current. Rainfall in the United States peaked at in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina. The remnants of Arlene dropped approximately of rainfall in Warren County, New York, in just two hours, washing out several roadways and flooding numerous homes.
===Tropical Storm Bret===
Between June 24 and June 27, a tropical wave and weak low-pressure area moved in tandem across Central America and eastern Mexico. The system then reached the Bay of Campeche early on June 28 and quickly organized into a tropical depression that day around 18:00 UTC. Six hours later, at 00:00 UTC on June 29, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bret and peaked with sustained winds of . Bret moved ashore northeastern Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, around 12:00 UTC, dissipating early on June 30 over San Luis Potosí.

Bret brought heavy rainfall across Mexico, reaching at least in El Raudal, Veracruz. One person drowned in Cerro Azul, while another death occurred in Naranjos due to cardiac arrest. The floods forced the evacuation of approximately 2,800 people, damaged around 3,000 houses, isolated 66 villages, and caused about $100 million (MXN, US$9.2 million) in damage.
===Hurricane Cindy===
A tropical depression formed on July 3 in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that moved off Africa nine days prior. The depression crossed the Yucatán Peninsula and dropped rainfall, reaching in Cancún. The system entered the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 5. Cindy intensified further into a minimal hurricane early on July 6, with peak winds of . The hurricane struck southeastern Louisiana and later southern Mississippi. Cindy continued across the southeastern United States and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 7 over The Carolinas; it eventually dissipated over the Gulf of St. Lawrence on July 12.

Across the United States, the hurricane caused $320 million in damage and three fatalities – one in Georgia from flooding, and two in Maryland from a car crash. Across Louisiana, the hurricane left 280,000 people without power. Rainfall in the United States peaked at in Saint Bernard, Louisiana. Cindy spawned a large tornado outbreak, including an F2 tornado near Hampton, Georgia, that caused over $40 million in damage at the Atlanta Motor Speedway alone. The same tornado inflicted severe damage to 11 planes and 5 vintage helicopters at Tara Field and impacted hundreds of homes to some degree.
===Hurricane Dennis===
A tropical wave led to the development of Tropical Depression Four in the southeastern Caribbean late on July 4 and further strengthened into Tropical Storm Dennis early the next day. The storm moved west-northwestward, strengthening into a hurricane on July 6 to the south of Hispaniola. On the next day, Dennis rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while moving between Jamaica and Haiti. Early on July 8, the hurricane briefly moved over Granma Province in southeastern Cuba. After briefly weakening, Dennis restrengthened to attain peak winds of in the Gulf of Guacanayabo. Later on July 8, Dennis moved ashore again in Matanzas Province. The hurricane crossed Cuba entered the Gulf of Mexico on July 9 as a weakened hurricane. Dennis re-intensified to a secondary peak of on July 10, only to weaken prior to its final landfall later that day near Pensacola, Florida. Dennis weakened and moved through the southeastern United States, the Ohio Valley, and eventually dissipating on July 18 over Ontario.

The outer rainbands of Dennis produced widespread flooding and landslides in Haiti, killing at least 56 people and leaving US$50 million in damage. Dennis brought torrential rain to Jamaica, reaching in Mavis Bank. One person died in Jamaica, and damage was estimated at US$31.7 million. The storm&#x27;s heaviest rainfall occurred in Cuba, reaching . Across the island, Dennis killed 16 people, and left US$1.4 billion in damage, affecting agriculture, tourist areas, infrastructure, and houses. Dennis moved ashore Florida near where Hurricane Ivan struck ten months prior. Damage from Dennis in the United States totaled $2.545 billion, and there were 15 deaths in the country, all but one in Florida. Rainfall in the United States reached near Camden, Alabama.
===Hurricane Emily===
On July 11, a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles which quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Emily. Moving westward, Emily strengthened into a minimal hurricane and struck Grenada at that intensity on July 14. Continuing across the Caribbean Sea, Emily eventually strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane on July 16 to the southwest of Jamaica, reaching peak winds of . Emily weakened after its peak intensity, striking the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on July 18 with winds of . Emily emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and restrengthened, making another landfall in Mexico on July 18 in Tamaulipas with winds of . A day later, Emily dissipated over land.

While moving through the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane produced strong winds and heavy rainfall that caused flooding and landslides across several islands. In Grenada, a man died when a landslide destroyed his house. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 2,641 homes in the country, leaving 167 families homeless. Emily&#x27;s damage on Grenada totaled EC$121.14 million (US$44.87 million). Flooding rains killed ten people in Haiti. In Jamaica, Emily produced of rainfall; associated flooding killed five people on the island. Collectively, Emily and earlier Hurricane Dennis left about US$96 million (J$6 billion) in damage to Jamaica. In Honduras, a man drowned in a river swollen by rains from Emily. Across Mexico, Emily&#x27;s damage was estimated at Mex$3.427 billion (US$322 million), resulting in disaster areas across four states. There were five deaths in the country related to Emily. The outskirts of Emily dropped heavy rainfall in southern Texas, damaging about $4.7 million worth of cotton.
===Tropical Storm Franklin===

Tropical Depression Six formed northeast of the Bahamas on July 21, originating from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on July 10. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Franklin, but wind shear disrupted the storm&#x27;s initial development. As the storm moved to the north and northeast, it intensified; on July 23, Franklin attained peak winds of . Three days later the storm passed west of Bermuda. An approaching trough turned Franklin to the northwest and weakened Franklin to a minimal tropical storm. Franklin restrengthened slightly as it accelerated northeastward. On July 30, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone south of Nova Scotia, and a day later it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm near Newfoundland.

On July 26, Bermuda recorded wind gusts of while the storm made its closest approach. The storm brought light rainfall to Newfoundland.
===Tropical Storm Gert===
A tropical wave, the same that spawned Tropical Storm Franklin, moved off Africa on July 10. It tracked west-northwest into the Bay of Campeche on July 23, where it contributed to the development of a tropical depression later that day. As convection increased near the center, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gert early on July 24. The cyclone did not persist long over water, instead moving ashore north of Cabo Rojo, Mexico, with winds early on July 25. It continued inland, affecting the same areas impacted by Hurricane Emily just days prior, and quickly dissipated over high terrain at the end of that day.

Gert dropped heavy rainfall, reaching in San Luis Potosí. Gert caused about US$6 million ($60 million 2005 MXN) in damage, and resulted in one fatality in Nuevo León.
===Tropical Storm Harvey===

Tropical Depression Eight formed on August 2 southwest of Bermuda from a tropical wave that left the African coast on July 22. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey on August 3 while moving northeastward. Due to strong wind shear, Harvey initially exhibited subtropical characteristics. On August 4, Harvey passed south of Bermuda. After moving away from the island, Harvey attained peak winds of late on August 4 and continued northeastward for a few days, transitioning into an extratropical storm on August 9. The storm gradually weakened and eventually dissipated northwest of the Azores on August 14.

On Bermuda, Harvey dropped of rainfall at Bermuda International Airport, flooding some roads. Sustained winds on the island reached .
===Hurricane Irene===
A high-latitude tropical wave led to the genesis of Tropical Depression Nine west of Cabo Verde on August 4. It moved to the northwest without much initial development. On August 7, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Irene, only to weaken into a tropical depression again the next day. Irene turned to the west, and later resumed its northwest track. It re-intensified into a tropical storm on August 11. On August 15, the storm turned to the north, passing between Bermuda and North Carolina. On the next day, it strengthened into a hurricane. Irene intensified further after turning to the northeast and later east. Late on August 16, the cyclone attained peak winds of . An approaching trough weakened Irene and caused it to accelerate northeastward. On August 18, Irene weakened into a tropical storm, and later that day was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm to the southeast of Newfoundland. Rip currents near Long Beach, New York killed a 16-year-old boy.
===Tropical Depression Ten===

Tropical Depression Ten formed between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 13 from a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic five days earlier. The depression moved slowly westward in an environment of strong vertical shear. Some weather models predicted relaxing shear and intensification of the system; however, the hostile conditions ripped the system apart, causing the depression to degenerate into a remnant low, and the NHC discontinued advisories on August 14, when no organized deep convection remained. The remnants of Tropical Depression Ten continued drifting northwestward, before degenerating further into a tropical wave north of the Leeward Islands, on August 18. Soon afterward, the low-level and mid-level circulations split, with the mid-level circulation lagging behind to the east. The remnant low-level circulation continued westward, before dissipating near Cuba on August 21. Producing occasional bursts of convection, the mid-level remnant circulation eventually merged with another tropical wave, which later produced Hurricane Katrina, approaching from the east, on August 19.
===Tropical Storm Jose===
A tropical wave, plausibly the same that spawned Tropical Depression Ten nine days earlier, led to the formation of Tropical Depression Eleven over the Bay of Campeche on August 22. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jose later that day and achieved a maximum strength of . Jose made landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz near the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Station on August 23. The cyclone became more organized two hours before making landfall and was forming an eye, but its winds remained under hurricane strength. Jose rapidly weakened and soon dissipated as it moved inland over Mexico. Jose was the earliest 10th named storm until surpassed by Tropical Storm Josephine in 2020.

While drenching Mexico&#x27;s Gulf coast, Jose forced some 25,000 residents from their homes in Veracruz state and damaged at least 16,000 homes in the state. Jose killed 11 people in Veracruz and 5 in Oaxaca. Damage in Mexico totaled roughly $45 million.
===Hurricane Katrina===
A tropical depression developed on August 23 from the complex interaction of a tropical wave, the mid-level remnants of Tropical Depression Ten, and a nearby upper-level trough. The depression became a tropical storm on August 24 and a hurricane on August 25, making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in southeastern Florida. Katrina imparted about $500 million in crop and infrastructure damage to the state. The hurricane quickly crossed Florida and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Katrina rapidly intensified to Category 5 status early on August 28, becoming the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane. Turning northward, the hurricane weakened as it approached the northern Gulf Coast. On August 29 at 11:10 UTC, Katrina made landfall in southeastern Louisiana as a Category 3 hurricane, with winds, and a barometric pressure of ; it was the third lowest pressure for a landfalling United States hurricane at the time, and fourth as of 2018. Katrina then crossed the Breton Sound, making a third and final landfall with winds near Pearlington, Mississippi. The cyclone quickly weakened after moving inland and became extratropical over Kentucky on August 30.

On August 28, the New Orleans National Weather Service issued an urgent weather bulletin describing potentially catastrophic impacts, comparing Katrina to Hurricane Camille of 1969. That same day, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin issued the city&#x27;s first-ever mandatory evacuation. About 80% of the city and 83% of neighboring Jefferson Parish evacuated ahead of the storm. The hurricane left catastrophic damage across southern Louisiana, with more than 300,000 houses damaged or destroyed; most of these were in Orleans Parish. In New Orleans, storm surge breached the levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and 17th Street and London Avenue Canals, flooding about 80% of the city. Portions of the city remained underwater for 43 days. The Mississippi and Alabama coastlines also suffered catastrophic damage from the storm&#x27;s storm surge, with very few structures remaining on the coast of the former. Across the region, the hurricane flooded and ruined about 350,000 vehicles. About 2.4 million people lost access to clean drinking water. Katrina also spawned an outbreak of 62 tornadoes across the eight states in the eastern United States.

Hurricane Katrina imparted catastrophic damage in portions of Louisiana and Mississippi, with overall damage estimated at $173 billion; this makes Katrina the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Throughout the United States, Katrina killed 1,392 people, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in the United States, and the deadliest American hurricane since 1928. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managed the aftermath of the hurricane, and faced criticism for its response time, lack of coordination with state agencies, supply shortages, and insufficient housing for federal workers. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs following the hurricane. Residents across the New Orleans area suffered health effects, including rashes and respiratory problems, from polluted water and air following the hurricane. Katrina forced about 800,000 people to move temporarily, which was the greatest number of displaced people in the country since the Dust Bowl. The United States federal government spent $110.6 billion in relief, recovery and rebuilding efforts, including $16 billion toward rebuilding houses, which was the nation&#x27;s largest ever housing recovery project. Within a year of the storm, most of the levees were largely repaired. Various countries and international agencies sent supplies or financial aid to assist in the hurricane response.
===Tropical Storm Lee===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 24. It developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while east of the Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear prevented much organization, and the depression degenerated into a low pressure area late on August 29. The remnants moved to the north and northeast, steered by a larger non-tropical system to the north. The convection increased on August 31; that day the system regenerated into a tropical depression, which strengthened further into Tropical Storm Lee. The storm attained peak winds of while located between Bermuda and the Azores. After 12 hours as a tropical storm, Lee weakened back to a tropical depression as it turned to the northwest, steered by the larger non-tropical storm. On September 2, the depression degenerated into a remnant low, which was absorbed by a cold front two days later.
===Hurricane Maria===
A powerful tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 27. As it moved west into the Atlantic, it became more organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1. Shear from an upper-level low to the southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in forecasts, as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean, becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4. In the central Atlantic, Hurricane Maria continued to strengthen in favorable conditions, and on September 5 briefly became a Category 3 hurricane with winds while east of Bermuda. Increasing shear and cooler waters caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a minimal hurricane on September 7. The interaction with a trough caused Maria to restrengthen slightly, as it curved to the northeast, moving around the subtropical ridge. Maria then weakened to a tropical storm, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 10. The former hurricane restrengthened over the northern Atlantic Ocean, only to weaken again as the storm passed south of Iceland. On September 14, the extratropical storm that was once Maria merged with another extratropical storm while approaching Norway.

The remnants of Maria brought resulted in heavy rainfall to Norway, triggering a landslide in Bergen that killed three people and injured seven others.
===Hurricane Nate===
A tropical wave left Africa on August 30 and moved into the southwestern Atlantic, where subsequent interaction with an upper-level low led to the genesis of a tropical depression south-southwest of Bermuda on September 5. This depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Nate, which moved slowly northeastward. On September 7, Nate intensified into the seventh hurricane of the season. A day later, the hurricane passed southeast of Bermuda, where it produced wind gusts of . Early on September 9, Nate attained peak winds of as it accelerated northeastward ahead of a trough. The same trough created unfavorable conditions, causing Nate to weaken quickly back to tropical storm status. On September 10, Nate transitioned into an extratropical storm which was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm near the Azores on September 13.

Canadian Navy ships headed to the U.S. Gulf Coast to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were slowed down trying to avoid Nate and Ophelia. Rip currents caused by hurricanes Nate and Maria killed one person in New Jersey and severely injured another person.
===Hurricane Ophelia===
The interplay of a cold front and a trough led to the development of Tropical Depression Sixteen over the northern Bahamas on September 6. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ophelia on September 7 and briefly into a hurricane on September 9 while stalled off the east coast of Florida. Ophelia fluctuated between hurricane and tropical storm intensity for the next week as it meandered off the southeastern United States. Twice it attained peak winds of . On September 14, the northern eyewall moved over the North Carolina coast from Wilmington to Morehead City. After moving away from the state, Ophelia weakened to tropical storm status for a fourth and final time due to stronger wind shear and dry air. The storm accelerated northeastward and passed southeast of Cape Cod. Ophelia transitioned into an extratropical storm on September 18 and subsequently crossed Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, eventually dissipating on September 23 north of the Scandinavian Peninsula.

Ophelia caused significant coastal erosion from the churning waves. The hurricane caused extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Damage in the United States was estimated at $70 million. The storm&#x27;s remnants produced strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada. Ophelia killed three people – a drowning in Florida from high surf, a traffic fatality in North Carolina, and a death from a fall in Nova Scotia.
===Hurricane Philippe===

On September 17, Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from a tropical wave about east of Barbados. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Philippe while taking a track to the north-northwest. Early on September 19, Philippe attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of a day later. Wind shear from an upper-level low caused the hurricane to weaken back to a tropical storm, exposing the center from the convection. On September 21, Philippe accelerated to the north and began moving around the upper-level low, which had extended to the surface and developed into a non-tropical cyclone. The storm briefly threatened Bermuda as it turned to the northwest and began a counterclockwise loop. On September 23, Philippe weakened to a tropical depression and later a remnant low; it was absorbed by the larger non-tropical cyclone a day later.

Philippe brought gusty winds and moisture to Bermuda, with of precipitation reported on September 23. The circulation that absorbed Philippe dropped light rainfall on the island, and was responsible for the lowest barometric pressure during the month.
===Hurricane Rita===

In mid-September, the southern extent of a stationary front devolved into a trough north of the Leeward Islands. A tropical wave interacted with this feature to form a tropical depression near the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18. It organized into Tropical Storm Rita later that day. Moving to the west-northwest, the storm&#x27;s intensification attenuated over the Bahamas before resuming thereafter, becoming a hurricane on September 20 between Cuba and Florida. Rapid intensification ensued as Rita moved into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on September 21, Rita strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane, and the next day it attained peak winds of . Its minimum pressure of was the lowest of any storm in the Gulf of Mexico on record. The hurricane weakened as it approached the northwest Gulf Coast. On September 24, Rita made landfall near the Texas–Louisiana border with sustained winds of . It rapidly weakened over land as it turned to the north and northeast, and was later absorbed by an approaching cold front on September 26 over Illinois.

Across the United States, Rita imparted $18.5 billion in damage and killed 120 people, although only seven deaths were directly related to the hurricane. Early in its evolution, Rita flooded houses in northern Cuba and the Florida Keys. Rita&#x27;s approach to the U.S. Gulf Coast prompted one of the largest mass evacuations in the country&#x27;s history, with an estimated 3.7 million people fleeing the Texas coast between Corpus Christi and Beaumont. Due in part to high temperatures preceding Rita&#x27;s landfall and elderly susceptibility to excessive heat, at least 80 people died during the mass evacuation; a coach fire en route to Dallas claimed 23 lives. Rita generated a storm surge that devastated parts of Cameron Parish in Louisiana, destroying most structures in towns like Cameron and Holly Beach. Storm surge also damaged homes in adjoining Jefferson County in Texas. In New Orleans, Rita produced additional flooding and overtopped levees that had been repaired after Hurricane Katrina a month earlier. Impacts from heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and tornadoes associated with Rita affected much of the lower Mississippi River Valley, and over a million electricity customers lost power.

A third of Cameron Parish&#x27;s population left the parish following the devastation wrought by Rita. FEMA granted over $1.3 billion to Louisiana to support recovery efforts; $668.8 million was allocated in the form of public assistance grants for initial recovery measures, and $523.5 million was sent to individuals as part of the agency&#x27;s Individuals and Households program.&lt;ref name=&quot;DR-1603/07-995&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Over $1 billion in federal assistance was also disbursed to Texas. Texas&#x27; Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program aided 1.85 million people in addition to supporting longer-term infrastructure repairs.
===Tropical Depression Nineteen===

On September 30, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Nineteen to the west of Cabo Verde. The newly formed cyclone exhibited deep convection in the southern semicircle, but its cloud pattern quickly deteriorated under the influence of strong wind shear. The system moved northwestward and failed to intensify beyond winds of , instead dissipating on October 2 without affecting land.
===Hurricane Stan===
A tropical wave emerged from Africa on September 17 and moved across the central Atlantic, hampered by north-northeasterly wind shear. The disturbance eventually traveled into the western Caribbean Sea, where it organized into a tropical depression southeast of Cozumel around 12:00 UTC on October 1. High pressure directed the cyclone toward the west-northwest, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Stan shortly before making landfall along the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. Stan briefly weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed over land, but it regained tropical storm strength over the Bay of Campeche on October 3, when ridging further intensified and forced the storm west-southwest. Rapid intensification ensued, allowing Stan to become a Category 1 hurricane before its second landfall east-southeast of Veracruz early on October 4. Once inland, the system rapidly unraveled over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, dissipating in the state of Oaxaca just after 06:00 UTC on October 5.

Stan killed 80 people in Mexico, and damage in the county was estimated at US$1.2 billion ($13.2 billion MXN). Stan was associated with a larger weather system across eastern Mexico and Central America. Torrential rainfall across this region killed 1,513 people in Guatemala, making it the deadliest natural disaster in the country&#x27;s history. Damage in Guatemala was estimated at US$996 million. El Salvador&#x27;s Santa Ana Volcano erupted on October 1, occurring simultaneous to the flooding. The flooding killed 69 people in the country, and damage from the two disasters was estimated at US$355.6 million. In Honduras, the weather system killed seven people and left US$100 million in damage. There were also three deaths in Nicaragua and one in Costa Rica. Road damage in Costa Rica from Stan and earlier Hurricane Rita was estimated at US$57 million (₡28 billion (CRC).
===Unnamed subtropical storm===
In the post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center identified an additional subtropical storm that had gone unclassified during the course of the season. In late September, an upper-level low formed west of the Canary Islands and moved westward, organizing into a subtropical depression early on October 4. It quickly intensified into a subtropical storm while curving northeast ahead of an approaching cold front. The storm attained peak winds of as it moved through the eastern Azores, where Santa Maria Island reported sustained winds up to . Early on October 5, the storm merged with the cold front; later that day, its remains were absorbed by a non-tropical low. The low that absorbed the storm would eventually become Hurricane Vince.
===Tropical Storm Tammy===

On October 5, Tropical Storm Tammy developed east of Florida following the interaction of a tropical wave and an upper-level trough. That day, it strengthened to reach peak winds of and made landfall near Jacksonville, Florida. Tammy weakened as it moved inland, crossing southern Georgia and Alabama. It was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm on October 6. Tammy dropped locally heavy rainfall along its path, causing minor damage. The frontal system that absorbed Tammy was a partial cause for severe flooding in New York, New Jersey and New England that killed 10 people in mid-October.
===Subtropical Depression Twenty-Two===

A surface trough developed on October 6, partially aided by outflow from Tropical Storm Tammy. It organized enough to be classified Subtropical Depression Twenty-Two on October 8, about southeast of Bermuda on October 8. The NHC classified it subtropical due to the nearby presence of an upper-level low. The depression encountered strong wind shear, and it degenerated into a remnant low on October 10 about 175 mi (280 km) southwest of Bermuda. The low merged with a cold front on October 11, and over the next three days it meandered off the east coast of the United States. On October 14, a larger extratropical storm absorbed the former subtropical depression. The system produced heavy rainfall across the northeastern United States from October 14–16, reaching over , just days after the region received rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Tammy. Two people died in Connecticut were swept away by the floods. About 500 people in Rhode Island required rescue, after the rains led to river flooding.
===Hurricane Vince===
Subtropical Storm Vince formed in the eastern Atlantic near Madeira on October 8 from the same non-tropical low that absorbed the unnamed subtropical storm. Vince transitioned into a tropical storm on the following day and was upgraded to a hurricane shortly thereafter. Although Vince was a very small and short-lived storm that only briefly reached hurricane strength, it was notable for developing in the northeastern Atlantic, well away from where hurricanes usually form. Vince made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula near Huelva, Spain, on October 11 just after weakening to a tropical depression. The storm left minor flooding in some areas.
=== Hurricane Wilma ===

An upper-level low over the southwestern Atlantic helped facilitate the formation of a large, monsoon-like gyre over the Caribbean Sea in middle October. A series of tropical waves moved into this area of disturbed weather and helped form a low-pressure system that developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-Four southwest of Jamaica on October 15. It intensified into Tropical Storm Wilma two days later. Wilma moved slowly through the warm waters of the western Caribbean Sea and began a period of rapid deepening on October 18 that lasted into the following day. This culminated in the cyclone attaining Category 5 hurricane status, reaching peak winds of and setting a record for the lowest barometric pressure in an Atlantic hurricane; at 12:00 UTC on October 19, hurricane hunters recorded a pressure of in the center of the tiny, well-defined eye of Wilma. Wilma weakened to Category 4 intensity by the time it made landfall on Cozumel on October 21. It later crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, turning northeast. On October 24, Wilma made landfall in southwestern Florida at Cape Romano with winds of . The hurricane quickly crossed the state and continued across the western Atlantic Ocean. Wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 26, which was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm a day later over Atlantic Canada.

In its formative stages, Wilma&#x27;s large circulation spread across much of the western Caribbean Sea, killing 12 people in Haiti and one in Jamaica. Wilma set a record in Mexico, and for the entire Western Hemisphere, for the highest 24 hour rainfall total, with recorded at Isla Mujeres. There were four deaths in Mexico, and nationwide damage was estimated at US$454 million ($4.8 billion MXN). Local and federal troops quelled looting and rioting in Cancún. Cancún&#x27;s airport was closed to the public in the days after the storm, forcing stranded visitors to fly out of Mérida, Yucatán, the region&#x27;s closest functioning airport. On November 28, Mexico declared a disaster area for 9 of Quintana Roo&#x27;s 11 municipalities. Mexico&#x27;s development bank – Nacional Financiera – provided financial assistance for businesses affected by Wilma and Stan through a $400 million fund (MXN, US$38 million).

A significant storm surge flooded areas of western Cuba, leaving US$704 million in damage. In Florida, Wilma caused $19 billion in damage and killed 30 people; five of the deaths were caused directly by the hurricane. Wilma inflicted a multi-billion dollar disaster in the Miami metropolitan area, including $2.9 billion in damage in Palm Beach County, $2 billion in Miami-Dade County, and $1.2 billion in Broward County. Numerous homes and businesses experienced some degree of impact, with over 55,000 dwellings and 3,600 workplaces damaged in Palm Beach County alone. On October 24, 2005, the same day Wilma made landfall in Florida, President George W. Bush approved a disaster declaration for 13 Florida counties. FEMA expended $342.5 million to the 227,321 approved applicants. Additionally, public assistance from FEMA totaled over $1.4 billion and grants for hazard mitigation projects exceeded $141.5 million. After leaving Florida, Wilma killed one person and left US$6.4 million in damage to the Bahamas, when it passed northwest of the country. On Bermuda, Hurricane Wilma produced wind gusts of .
===Tropical Storm Alpha===
A tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty-Five in the eastern Caribbean on October 22. Later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Alpha as it moved west-northwestward. Around 10:00 UTC on October 23, Alpha made landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic, with winds of . Alpha weakened to a tropical depression over Hispaniola&#x27;s steep mountains. The cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean, where it was absorbed by Hurricane Wilma on October 24. The storm claimed 26 lives, with more than half of them in Haiti. Alpha destroyed 43 homes and damaged 191 others in Haiti.
===Hurricane Beta===
Late on October 26, the same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Storm Alpha led to the formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-Six over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Early the next day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beta. The storm strengthened into a hurricane on October 29 and reached major hurricane intensity on October 30, with sustained winds around . However, Beta weakened to a Category 2 prior to landfall in Nicaragua. The storm rapidly weakened inland and dissipated on October 31.

The Colombian island of Providencia was subjected to hurricane-force winds for several hours as the center of the storm moved very slowly by the island. Reports indicate extensive damage to homes and a loss of communications with the islanders. In Honduras and Nicaragua, over 1,000 structures were damaged by the storm, hundreds of which were destroyed. Overall, Beta caused nine fatalities and more than $15.5 million in damage across four countries.
===Tropical Storm Gamma===
Late on November 13, Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven formed from a tropical wave about west-southwest of St. Lucia. While passing through the Lesser Antilles, the heavy rainfall caused mudslides, killing two people on Bequia. The cyclone briefly attained tropical storm status, but wind shear prevented further development of the system, and advisories were discontinued on November 16 as it lost its closed circulation about southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. The remnants of the depression continued westward and moved along the northern shore of Honduras, merging with parts of a larger low pressure system. It is uncertain whether the remnants of Gamma absorbed the low pressure system or vice versa. The storm strengthened and a closed circulation formed on November 18, making Gamma a tropical storm for the second time. After regeneration, and after making landfall over northern Honduras, floods from Gamma killed 34 people in Honduras. Three people died in Belize related to the storm. Gamma meandered in the Caribbean Sea for a short time, until slowly weakening and eventually disintegrating into a remnant low late on November 20. The storm caused 39 deaths in total.
===Tropical Storm Delta===
Delta originated from a broad and non-tropical low-pressure area that arose southwest of the Azores on November 19, initially moving northeast along the trailing fringes of a passing cold front. Convection developed atop the center of the nascent disturbance two days later, and satellite data suggested that it was acquiring thermodynamic characteristics exhibited by tropical cyclones. On November 22, the NHC classified the low-pressure system as a subtropical storm with the name &quot;Delta&quot;. Delta took a south-southwestward course and further coalesced its associated showers, leading to its re-designation as a tropical storm on November 23. It stalled west-southwest of the Canary Islands and attained peak winds of on November 24. Delta moved erratically over the next two days and weakened to a low-end tropical storm in response to increasing wind shear. A strengthening trough over western Europe accelerated Delta towards the east-northeast on November 27, concurrent with the brief emergence of an eye and a period of intensification. Delta&#x27;s tropical characteristics later succumbed to wind shear and cold air, resulting in its extratropical transition on November 28 while west-northwest of the western Canary Islands; as an extratropical system, Delta tracked east, passing north of the Canary Islands before moving into Morocco and Algeria on November 29, where it dissipated.

Delta caused severe damage in the Canary Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned after boats overturned; there were 12 people missing from the overturned boat. El Dedo de Dios, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary Islands, was toppled during the storm. Damage throughout the Canary Islands was estimated at €312 million ($364 million 2005 US dollars). Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000 people without power and forcing airports to close down. The remnants of Delta later moved into Morocco, bringing needed rain.
===Hurricane Epsilon===
A surface low attached to a stationary front formed underneath an upper-level low east of Bermuda on November 27. The surface low detached from the frontal zone and acquired tropical characteristics as deep convection wrapped around its center, leading to the development of Tropical Storm Epsilon early on November 29. The NHC consistently forecast that the storm would weaken; however, Epsilon gradually intensified as it moved westward and later looped to the northeast. The storm attained hurricane status on December 2 as the track shifted to the east. Neither Epsilon&#x27;s structure or strength changed appreciably over the next few days, and it attained peak winds of on December 5. A building ridge turned Epsilon to the southwest on December 6, and it maintained its intensity due to low wind shear. Epsilon remained a hurricane until December 7. Epsilon degenerated into a remnant low on December 8; the circulation dissipated two days later.
===Tropical Storm Zeta===
Towards the end of December, an upper-level low interacted with a cold front, which produced an area of low-pressure by December 28, about to the west-northwest of Cabo Verde. Over the next couple of days, the system developed a low-level circulation and atmospheric convection increased as it moved north-westwards, before the NHC classified it as Tropical Storm Zeta during December 30. Over the next couple of days, the system gradually intensified further in a region of favorable anticyclonic outflow, as it slowly moved west-northwest in response to a mid-level low to the southwest. On January 1, Zeta peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of . It weakened on January 2, only to re-intensify to its peak intensity on January 3. Zeta weakened again as it turned westward, degenerating into a remnant low on January 6; the circulation dissipated on the next day to the southeast of Bermuda. Zeta affected the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race by producing high swells that moved boats off course.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2005. This was the same list used for the 1999 season, with the exceptions of &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Lee&quot;, which replaced &quot;Floyd&quot; and &quot;Lenny&quot;. The names &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Lee&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Nate&quot;, &quot;Ophelia&quot;, &quot;Philippe&quot;, &quot;Rita&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot;, &quot;Tammy&quot;, &quot;Vince&quot; and &quot;Wilma&quot; from the regular list were used for the first (and in the cases of &quot;Rita&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot;, and &quot;Wilma&quot;, only) time in 2005, as were the auxiliary list Greek letters &quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Beta&quot;, &quot;Gamma&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Epsilon&quot; and &quot;Zeta&quot;. This was the first Atlantic hurricane season to exhaust the designated list of 21 storm names, and the first to utilize the auxiliary list.

===Retirement===

In the spring of 2006, the hurricane committee of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) retired five names: &quot;Dennis&quot;, &quot;Katrina&quot;, &quot;Rita&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot;, and &quot;Wilma&quot;, from the Atlantic hurricane name lists. They were replaced with &quot;Don&quot;, &quot;Katia&quot;, &quot;Rina&quot;, &quot;Sean&quot; and &quot;Whitney&quot; for the 2011 season. This set a new record for the number of storm names retired from a single season, surpassing the previous record of four names, held by the 1955, 1995, 2004 seasons.

There was considerable discussion at that time on the usage of the Greek alphabet. The committee agreed that the usage of the Greek alphabet had a &quot;major important political, economic and social impact globally, which might not have happened if a secondary or circular list of names had been used&quot;, and that the Greek alphabet would be used again if the traditional naming list was exhausted. It was also decided that it was not practical to retire a Greek letter. Storms named with Greek letters that would otherwise be eligible for retirement would appear in the retired name list, but have a notation affixed with the circumstances. However, when faced with retiring Eta and Iota following the 2020 season, when the Greek alphabet was next utilized, the WMO decided to discontinue its further use altogether. A new auxiliary list of given names was implemented, making any retirements less problematic.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2005 USD.

<doc id="1142617" wikidata="Q3108542" url="?curid=1142617" title="Seiyu Group">
<text>, or , is a Japanese group of supermarkets, shopping centers and department stores, headquartered in Akabane (赤羽), Kita, Tokyo. On May 8, 2023, the Akabane headquarters office was relocated due to the redevelopment of Seiyu&#x27;s Akabane store site. The current head office location is Kichijoji Honmachi, Musashino City, Tokyo.

Its company name means &quot;innovation, leadership and excellence&quot;.
==History==
The group was established in December 1946, and was formed in 1956 by Seibu Department Stores, a group company of Seibu Railway. In 1980, Seiyu launched its private brand &quot;Mujirushi-Ryōhin&quot; (commonly known as MUJI outside Japan). MUJI was transferred to the Ryohin Keikaku Company in 1990, and is no longer part of Seiyu. Also in 1980, Seiyu launched the &quot;All-Value-No-Frills&quot; brand, an innovation in product-line development. Over 1,450 high quality items in the brand are sold at a moderate price.

In 1991, Seiyu formed a consortium with six Asian retailers and one Hawaiian company to exchange expertise and set up joint ventures across Asia.

In 1996, Seiyu expanded to Thailand with local realtor Bang Chang, with its first outlet opened on September 26. It targets to have 20 stores by 2000.

On December 31, 2003, Seiyu and the US retail chain Walmart signed a partnership agreement in which Walmart would teach global supply chain practices. Numazu, Shizuoka was the site of the first Seiyu store using Walmart methods.

Walmart bought a 37 percent stake in Seiyu in 2003, and according to a company press release, in late 2005, Walmart acquired a majority stake in the company, buying out the remainder in 2008.

Previously, the company had a registered office in Higashi-Ikebukuro, Toshima, Tokyo.

In 2019, Walmart named Lionel Desclée, formerly of Delhaize and the Belgian pet shop chain Tom&amp;Co, president and CEO of both Seiyu and Walmart Japan. In remarks after his appointment, he said Walmart had no interest in selling Seiyu. However, that June, Walmart outlined plans to relist Seiyu on the stock market.

Over the 2019-2020 period, Seiyu comparative-store sales grew 180 basis points faster than the market and EBITDA increased by nearly 40%. In addition, Rakuten Seiyu Netsuper, jointly operated by Seiyu and Rakuten, recorded a nearly 40% year-on-year increase in gross merchandise sales in the fourth quarter of 2020.

In 2020, Walmart announced they would be selling 65% of their shares in the company to private-equity firm KKR in a deal valuing 329 stores and 34,600 employees at $1.6 billion. Walmart is supposed to retain 15% and a seat on the board, while Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. will receive 20%.

In 2023, Rakuten announced that it would sell its 20% stake in Seiyu to KKR. 

==Past regional expansion plans==
In addition to its Japanese operations, Seiyu also had department stores operating under its name in Singapore and Hong Kong. The group used to directly operate these stores, but in October 2005, its three Singapore stores were sold to CapitaLand Limited, which transferred them to Beijing Hualian Group later the same year. The group&#x27;s Hong Kong store in New Town Plaza, Sha Tin was sold to Sun Hung Kai Properties Limited in June 2005, but like the stores in Singapore, continued to operate under the Seiyu name until April 2008. The Singapore stores were then renamed BHG, which stands for &quot;Beijing Hualian Group&quot;.

==Group companies==
Seiyu Group refers to an association of companies, of which The Seiyu, Ltd. is the parent. The companies in Seiyu Group are:
*The Seiyu, Ltd.
*Hokkaido Seiyu Co., Ltd.
*Tohoku Seiyu Co., Ltd.
*S.S.V. Inc.
*Kyushu Seiyu Co., Ltd.
*Sunny Co., Ltd.
*Wakana Co., Ltd.

<doc id="1142623" wikidata="Q708366" url="?curid=1142623" title="Pulicat Lake">
<text>Pulicat Lake is the second largest brackish water lagoon in India, (after Chilika Lake), measuring . A major part of the lagoon lies in the Tirupati district of Andhra Pradesh. The lagoon is one of three important wetlands that attracts northeast monsoon rain clouds during the October to December season. The lagoon comprises the following regions: Pulicat Lake (Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu), Marshy/Wetland Land Region (AP), Venadu Reserve Forest (AP), and Pernadu Reserve Forest (AP). The lagoon was cut across in the middle by the Sriharikota Link Road, which divided the water body into lagoon and marshy land. The lagoon encompasses the Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary. The barrier island of Sriharikota separates the lagoon from the Bay of Bengal and is home to the Indian Space Research Organisation&#x27;s Satish Dhawan Space Centre.

==History==

 In the 1st century, the anonymous mariner who wrote &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; listed Podouke (Pulicat) as one of the three ports on the east coast of India. In the 2nd century, Ptolemy&#x27;s list of ports on this coast included Podouke Emporion.

In the 13th century, Arabs migrated to the shores of the lagoon after they were banished from Mecca for refusing to pay tributes to a new caliph. Streets with dilapidated masonry houses once occupied by these Arab Muslims are still found in the area and resident families claim records in Arabic testifying the migration.

The Portuguese colonized the lagoon in 16th century followed by the Dutch. The Dutch drifted to the lagoon as their ships got stuck on the shores of Karimanal village on the opposite side of the mouth of the lagoon. During the Dutch occupation, Pulicat was known by the name &quot;Pallaicatta&quot;. Fort Geldria dating to 1609, a church, a cemetery with tombs and mausoleums constructed by the Dutch are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The Dutch transacted business with the British East India Company and other countries in the region.

A scientific study of the palynological characteristics of the lagoon was conducted by taking sedimentary soil samples from four test pits. It shows that the vegetational reconstruction from peat beds at a.m.s.l. and (a.m.s.l.) in the west at Sullurpeta and Kasdredinilem, respectively, is indicative of a palaeoshoreline. The sea level reached its maximum around 6650 plus or minus 110 yrs BP in Sullurpeta, west from the present shoreline. The radiocarbon dates of peat bed at Kasdreddinilem reveals an age of 4608 plus or minus 122 yrs BP, indicating the shift in mangrove line eastwards during the regressive phase.

==Geography and topography==
The lagoon&#x27;s boundary limits range between 13.33° to 13.66° N and 80.23° to 80.25°E, with a dried part of the lagoon extending up to 14.0°N.; with about 96% of the lagoon in Andhra Pradesh and 3% in Tamil Nadu. The lagoon is aligned parallel to the coast line with its western and eastern parts covered with sand ridges. Area of the lagoon varies with the tide; in high tide and in low tide. Its length is about with width varying from to . Climate of the lagoon coast line is dominated by tropical monsoons. Air temperature varies from to . The large spindle-shaped barrier island named Sriharikota separates the lagoon from the Bay of Bengal. The sandy barrier islands of Irkam and Venad and smaller islands in the north are aligned north–south and divide the lagoon into eastern and western sectors. The morphology of the lagoons is categorized under four types with large areas under mudflats and sandflats. The fishing village of Pulicat is at the south end of the lake. The Satish Dhawan Space Center is located on the north end of the island. Pulicat, Dugarājupatnam and Sullurpeta are villages located on the periphery of the lagoon.

==Hydrology==
Two rivers which feed the lagoon are the Arani River at the southern tip and the Kalangi River from the northwest, in addition to some smaller streams. The Buckingham Canal, a navigation channel, is part of the lagoon on its western side. The lagoon&#x27;s water exchange with the Bay of Bengal is through an inlet channel at the north end of Sriharikota and out flow channel of about width at its southern end, both of which carry flows only during the rainy season. The lagoon acts as buffer to retain the accumulated flood water till the flood water is discharged gradually to the sea during the monsoon period and cyclones. The lagoon and its river basins are located both in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states. The lagoon and its drainage river basins become interstate river basin as per Interstate River Water Disputes Act 1956. Most of the lagoon area including its water outlet to the sea is located in Andhra Pradesh.
The water quality of the lagoon varies widely during various seasons – summer, pre–monsoon, monsoon and post–monsoon – as the depth and width of the lagoon mouth varies, causing a dynamic situation of mixing and circulation of waters. The resultant salinity variation and DO (dissolved oxygen) affects the primary production, plankton, biodiversity and fisheries in this lagoon. Salinity values vary from zero during the monsoon to about 52,000 ppm (hyper saline) during post and pre–monsoon seasons. Adjustment to this wide variation is difficult for sessile and sedentary species in the lagoon. However, euryhaline species still dwell in the lagoon. The benthic or the bottom habitat of this lagoon is classified into three zones. The southern zone, the first zone, is dominated by sand with some admixture of mud. The second zone at the northern region is wholly muddy. The third zone with sand and mud in equal parts is overgrown with patches of weeds and is reported to be rich in benthic biodiversity. Toxicity levels of heavy metals such as magnesium, lead, zinc, nickel, cadmium, aluminum and copper and chemicals such as ammonia, sulphate and fluoride in the lagoon are well within permissible limits. Recently, the lagoon likely experienced up to 40% desalination due to the impact of freshwater floods from the 2015 South India floods.

==Flora and fauna==
The lagoon has rich flora and fauna diversity, which supports active commercial fisheries and a large and varied bird population.

===Limnology===
Fishing is the major occupation in the many villages located around the lagoon periphery and on the islands. The lagoon has rich fish diversity, mostly marine species, some truly brackish water and a few freshwater species. Mullets and catfish are the major brackish water fish, which have supported sustenance fishing for the lagoon fishermen. The lagoon is a nursery for several species of fish. Two thirds of the settlements in the lagoon area are in Tamil Nadu and the balance in Andhra Pradesh. 12,370 fishermen live on full-time fishery in the lagoon (6,000 in Andhra Pradesh and 6,370 in Tamil Nadu).

An average 1,200 tonnes of fish and crustaceans are harvested annually, of which prawns constitute 60%, followed by mullets. Seafood exports of white and tiger prawns, jellyfish, finfish and live lagoon green crabs are also economic benefits from the lagoon. 168 total fish species are reported. The frequently found ones are the mullets: &quot;M. cunnesius&quot;, &quot;M. jerdoni&quot;, &quot;M. dussumieri&quot;, &quot;M. cephalus&quot;, &quot;M. bornensis&quot; and blowfish &quot;T. nigropunctatus&quot;, &quot;T. leopardus&quot;, &quot;Barbus dorsalis&quot;, catfish &quot;Macrones vittatus&quot;, sardines, &quot;Sardinella fimbriata&quot; and milk fish. Finfish, green crabs, clams and prawns are the most commercially exploited fishes of the lagoon. Endangered green sea turtles are found on the beaches of Sriharikota beach. Salt is also produced from the lagoon.

===Avifauna===

The shallow lagoon is known for its diversity of aquatic birds and is an important stopover on migration routes and is reported to be the third most important wetland on the eastern coast of India for migratory shorebirds, particularly during the spring and autumn migration seasons. In view of the rich avifauna of the lagoon, two bird sanctuaries are established in the lagoon, one each in the Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states. The Andhra Pradesh portion of Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary, established in September 1976, has an area of within the lagoon&#x27;s total area in the state in the Tada Taluk of Nellore district. The Wildlife Division of the state has listed 115 species of water and land birds in the sanctuary. Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary is also located nearby in its catchment area. The Tamil Nadu part of the lagoon of area, extending over the Ponneri and Gummidipundi taluks of Thiruvallur district, was declared a bird sanctuary in October 1980.

Every year approximately 15,000 greater flamingos are reported to visit the lagoon along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks. The highest concentrations of flamingo are found in the periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below . The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity. Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, Indian spot-billed duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew. Several species of wintering waterfowl have been noted including bar-headed goose, ruddy shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, common teal, northern pintail, garganey, northern shoveller, common pochard, brown-headed gull, black-headed gull, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern and Caspian tern. Birds of prey which appear in winter are the: white-bellied sea eagle, harriers and peregrine falcons. The largest concentrations of flamingos occur in the Andhra Pradesh part of the sanctuary, around the islands of Vendadu and Irukkam.

===Aquatic vegetation===
There are 59 species of aquatic vegetation, eight of Cyanophyceae, seven Chlorophyceae and two Rhodophyceae. Patches of residual, dry, evergreen forest and large areas of littoral scrub in woodlands in fishing villages bordering the lagoon are seen. Invasive phytoplankton species of &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot;, &quot;Spirulina major&quot;, &quot;Oscillatoria&quot; spp., &quot;Anabaena&quot; spp., &quot;Rhizosolenia castracanei&quot;, &quot;Eucampia cornuta&quot; and &quot;Climacodium frauenfeldianum&quot; in the plains on the periphery of the lake have been recorded.

==Threats and issues==

Due to climate change and delay in the northeast monsoons quite often, lack of dredging activities in the estuaries region like Duggarajapatanam, Mulapadava and Tupilipalem. Diversity of the lake looks like the semi salt desert of what was the Aral Sea. It directly impacts wildlife conservation in those areas and livelihoods of the people of the coastal community. Evidence of these changes were inevitable, bird migrations has decreased rapidly due to lack of maintenance of the lake beds. It affects the almost 160 km2 of the lake. Almost 40% of the lake was dried up by 2020. Recent trends and data show that Pullicat Lake is in the verge of destruction due to the lack of dredging activities. If same trends continuous it would be like another Aral Sea.

In the Andhra Pradesh part of the lagoon, several threats to the lagoon have been identified. These are: pollution from sewage, pesticides, agricultural chemicals and industrial effluents from Arani and Kalangi rivers draining into the lagoon bringing fertilizers and pesticides with the runoff from the agricultural field into the drainage basin; domestic sewage; effluents and wastes from numerous fish-processing units; oil spills from the mechanized boats. Release of of marine chemicals, and salt-manufacturing industry and shrimp farming in more than on the eastern part of the lagoon, have affected the Pulicat Bird Sanctuary; the livelihood of 30,000 fishermen and 20,000 agricultural labourers (for whom fishing is an off-season economic activity) have also been disturbed. This activity is also reported to have serious impact on aquaculture development.

Siltation and periodic closure of the bar mouth due to the dynamic process of sediment transport has caused reduction of size and seasonal closure of the mouth of the lagoon. It has reduced fresh sea-water exchange and made the lagoon shallow and turbid. It is reported that average depth, in the early 20th century, has been reduced to less than in the lagoon. This has caused difficulties such as the bar mouth getting silted up and being closed during the summer season (June–July to Oct–Nov), and an increase in flood levels during the rainy season. The lagoon acts as a large evaporating basin when the bar is closed resulting in salinity levels remaining low or high subject to the flood discharge into the lagoon during the north east monsoon. Fluctuation of water levels in the lagoon (above or below the sea level) is affecting flora, fauna and fisheries; siltation has caused variation of the lagoon mouth resulting in reduction of tidal inflows and consequent decline in stocking of commercially important species of prawns and mullets. The flood plains reclamation in Arani River basin for industrial and residential purposes is also increasing lagoon maximum water level during the floods.

Runoff from agricultural fields in the drainage basins of the Arani and Kalangi rivers into the lagoon has increased pollution load from fertilizers and pesticides; pollution from domestic sewage is also being released to the lagoon. A petrochemical complex, power plant and a satellite port on Ennore creek have further aggravated the problem; there is threat of flooding of 14 island – villages of the lagoon; subsequent to the tsunami in 2004, the number of fishing boats have increased resulting in the &quot;Catch Per Unit Effort&quot; of fish, prawns and crabs declined from 1000 tonnes to about 700 tonnes; and this has increased the social and fishing rights conflicts between marine based fishermen and the lagoon fishermen.

Due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, lagoon fishery was adversely affected, with many fishing communities losing all means of livelihood until the middle of April 2005, as the loss of lives, homes and boats prevented them from going fishing in the sea and the lagoon. They subsisted on relief supplies provided by the government and other agencies. Many people in fish related trades were also affected. However, a beneficial effect of the tsunami has been the widening of the opening to the lagoon.

==Restoration and social activities==
Various groups and non governmental organizations are active in the area. The AARDE Foundation maintains Pulicat Museum at Pazhaverkadu to create awareness among inhabitants and city dwellers. AARDE Foundation represented Pulicat at United Nation&#x27;s World Urban Forum and Habitat III as an associate-partner. Pulicat Day, part of Ramsar&#x27;s World Wetlands Day, is celebrated every February by AARDE to bring attention to this fragile environment. An expert plan on &quot;Wildlife Action Plan for Conservation Measures on the Pulicat lagoon Sanctuary&quot; has envisaged to set up a hydro biological research station, visitor center, provide shallow-bottomed boats to enable sanctuary staff to patrol the lagoon and to prepare a management plan and conservation strategy for the entire area. COPDANET is striving to implement traditional &quot;Paadu system&quot; and regular desilting to ensure adequate salt and fresh water mix in the lagoon which could enhance fish resources. Centre for Research on New International Economic Order (CReNIEO) has been promoting welfare of fishermen and management of the natural resources of the lagoon. A research study by Loyola College, Chennai reported in 2007 that the lagoon that bore the brunt of industrial pollution has made an ecological turnaround, recording toxicity levels well within permissible limits. Under the Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project (TEAP), construction of a high level bridge across Pulicat lagoon along with approach roads on both sides of the lagoon has been constructed providing a safe escape route for people residing on the islands and also access for emergency response operations.

The southern part of the lagoon in Tamil Nadu from the estuary is rich in fishes and the fishing is controlled by a traditional &quot;Paadu system&quot;. Paadu is a traditional system of getting entitlements to eligible members of a particular community for undertaking specified fishing activity in certain designated areas. The fishing grounds fall within a radius of from the mouth of the lagoon with a salinity well maintained without much drying even during low tides. However, this traditional practice is based on caste control of the access rights to the high productive areas and is opposed by eastern fishermen and ocean-side villages. As a result, conflicts leading to violence have been reported.

==Transportation==
The Tamil Nadu part of the lagoon is north of Chennai and the nearest airport and major railway station are in Chennai. The nearest suburban railway station is at Ponneri. To reach Pulicat on the National Highway 16 from Chennai, drive north toward Nellore, after , turn right towards Ponneri village and continue to Pulicat village. Sullurpeta station is from Sriharikota. The Buckingham Canal on the western side of the lagoon is the navigation route through the lagoon used by cargo and passenger vessels.

<doc id="1142625" wikidata="Q1214091" url="?curid=1142625" title="The Kreutzer Sonata">
<text>The Kreutzer Sonata (, ) is a novella by Leo Tolstoy, named after Beethoven&#x27;s Kreutzer Sonata. The novella was published in 1889, and was promptly censored by the Russian authorities. The work is an argument for the ideal of sexual abstinence and an in-depth first-person description of jealous rage. The main character, Pozdnyshev, relates the events leading up to his killing of his wife: in his analysis, the root causes for the deed were the &quot;animal excesses&quot; and &quot;swinish connection&quot; governing the relation between the sexes.

==Summary==

During a train ride, Pozdnyshev overhears a conversation concerning marriage, divorce and love. When a woman argues that marriage should not be arranged but based on true love, he asks &quot;what is love?&quot; and points out that, if understood as an exclusive preference for one person, it often passes quickly. Convention dictates that two married people stay together, and initial love can quickly turn into hatred. He then relates how he used to visit prostitutes when he was young, and complains that women&#x27;s dresses are designed to arouse men&#x27;s desires. He further states that women will never enjoy equal rights to men as long as men view them as objects of desire, yet describes their situation as a form of power over men, mentioning how much of society is geared towards their pleasure and well-being and how much sway they have over men&#x27;s actions.

Pozdnyshev relates that after he meets and marries his wife, periods of passionate love and vicious fights alternate. She bears five children, and then receives contraceptives: &quot;The last excuse for our swinish life – children – was then taken away, and life became viler than ever.&quot; His wife takes a liking to a violinist, Troukhatchevsky, and the two perform Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Kreutzer Sonata&quot; (Sonata No. 9 in A Major for piano and violin, Op. 47) together. Pozdnyshev complains that some music is powerful enough to change one&#x27;s internal state to a foreign one. He hides his raging jealousy and goes on a trip, thinking that the violinist was about to move away; however, he is made aware from his wife&#x27;s letter that the musician has not left, and has visited her instead. Returning early, he finds Troukhatchevsky and his wife sitting at the table and kills his wife with a dagger. The violinist escapes; Pozdnyshev states, &quot;I wanted to run after him, but remembered that it is ridiculous to run after one&#x27;s wife&#x27;s lover in one&#x27;s socks; and I did not wish to be ridiculous but terrible.&quot; He realizes what he has done only a few days later, when he is led to his wife&#x27;s funeral. He is acquitted of murder in light of his wife&#x27;s apparent adultery. At the end of his tale, Pozdnyshev implores the narrator for forgiveness.

==Censorship==
Due to the unusual and scandalous nature of the work for that time, the publication of the Kreutzer Sonata in a magazine or in a separate publication was prohibited by censorship. Only after a conversation between Countess Alexandra Andreevna Tolstoy (Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s great-aunt, the famous Alexandrine (a girl, chambermaid, tutor of Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna) with Emperor Alexander III, did the emperor allow the story to be published as part of the next volume of Tolstoy&#x27;s collected works. However, the censorship ban only increased the attractiveness of the story, which long before publication began to be distributed in lists and read in private homes.

In 1890, the United States Post Office Department prohibited the mailing of newspapers containing serialized installments of &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot;. This was confirmed by the U.S. Attorney General in the same year. Some American publishing houses published excerpts from the story as a separate pamphlet to advertise the story and distributed them through street vendors in New York for a nominal price. Carts even appeared in the city, on which it was written in large letters: “Forbidden by the Russian government and the Postmaster General of the United States is Tolstoy’s best work, &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot;.” The ban on its sale was struck down in New York and Pennsylvania courts in 1890.

President Theodore Roosevelt called Tolstoy a &quot;sexual moral pervert.&quot;

==Epilogue==
In the Epilogue To The Kreutzer Sonata, published in 1890, Tolstoy clarifies the intended message of the novella, writing:

Countering the argument that widespread abstinence would lead to a cessation of the human race, he describes chastity as an ideal that provides guidance and direction, not as a firm rule. Writing from a position of deep religiosity (that he had explained in his &quot;Confession&quot; in 1882), he points out that not Christ, but the Church (which he despises) instituted marriage. &quot;The Christian&#x27;s ideal is love of God and his neighbor, self-renunciation in order to serve God and his neighbour; carnal love, marriage, means serving oneself, and therefore is, in any case, a hindrance in the service of God and men&quot;.

During the international celebration of Tolstoy&#x27;s 80th birthday in 1908, G. K. Chesterton criticized this aspect of Tolstoy&#x27;s thought in an article in the 19 September issue of &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;: &quot;Tolstoy is not content with pitying humanity for its pains: such as poverty and prisons. He also pities humanity for its pleasures, such as music and patriotism. He weeps at the thought of hatred; but in &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; he weeps almost as much at the thought of love. He and all the humanitarians pity the joys of men.&quot; He went on to address Tolstoy directly: &quot;What you dislike is being a man. You are at least next door to hating humanity, for you pity humanity because it is human.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Plays===
* The novella was adapted into a Yiddish play in 1902 by Russian-Jewish playwright Jacob Gordin. American playwright Langdon Mitchell later adapted Gordin&#x27;s version into English, which debuted on Broadway on September 10, 1906.
* In 2007 in Wellington, New Zealand, a newly devised theatrical work, &quot;The Kreutzer&quot;, was premiered, combining dance, music, theatre and multimedia projections with both pieces of music (Beethoven and Janáček) played live. Sara Brodie provided the adaptation, direction and choreography. A reworked version was presented in Auckland during March 2009 at the Auckland Arts Festival.
* The novella was adapted for the stage by Darko Spasov in 2008, and produced as a one-act play in 2009 for the National Theatre in Štip, Republic of Macedonia, directed by Ljupco Bresliski, performed by Milorad Angelov.
* Laura Wade&#x27;s &quot;Kreutzer vs. Kreutzer&quot; is also inspired by Tolstoy.
* The novella was adapted for the stage by Ted Dykstra and produced as a one-act play for the Art of Time Ensemble of Toronto in 2008, and again for the Soulpepper Theatre Company in 2011.
* Nancy Harris adapted the novella into a one-act monologue for the Gate Theatre in London in 2009, directed by Natalie Abrahami and starring Hilton McRae. The production was revived in 2012 at the Gate Theatre, and also at La MaMa in New York City.
* The novella was adapted by Sue Smith for the State Theatre Company of South Australia as part of the 2013 Adelaide Festival. It was directed by Geordie Brookman and featured Renato Musolino (who stepped into the role at the last minute, as a replacement for Barry Otto, who had taken ill).
* A one-act adaptation by Utah playwright Eric Samuelson was produced by Plan-B Theatre Company and the NOVA Chamber Music Series in 2015. It ran from 18 October to 9 November at the Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was directed by Jerry Rapier, and featured Robert Scott Smith, Kathryn Eberle, and Jason Hardnik. Eberle and Hardnik were musicians in the Utah Symphony at the time.

* In Frederic Rzewski&#x27;s piece &quot;Marriage&quot; for speaking pianist the performer recites Pozdnyshev&#x27;s words while playing the instrument.

===Ballet===
In 2000, the Carolina Ballet, with original choreography by Robert Weiss and combining the music of Beethoven, Janáček, and J. Mark Scearce, mounted an innovative production combining dance and drama, with a narrator/actor telling the story and flashbacks leading into the ballet segments.

===Painting===
The novella inspired the 1901 painting &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; by René François Xavier Prinet, which shows a passionate kiss between the violinist and the pianist. The painting was used for years in Tabu perfume ads.

===Novels===
Arab Israeli author Sayed Kashua&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;Second Person Singular&quot; echoes &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; set in present-day Israel. A copy of &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; also functions as a major plot device.

The Dutch author Margriet de Moor wrote a book called &quot;Kreutzersonate&quot; after Janáček&#x27;s string quartet, which was inspired by the novella and Beethoven.

<text>Sergeant Charles Ernest Garforth VC (23 October 1891 – 1 July 1973) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Garforth was 22 years old, and a corporal in the 15th (The King&#x27;s) Hussars, British Army during the First World War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 August 1914 at Harmingnies, Belgium, Corporal Garforth volunteered to cut wire under fire, which enabled his squadron to escape. On 2 September when under constant fire in Dammartin, France, he extricated a sergeant who was lying under his dead horse, and carried him to safety. The next day, when another sergeant had lost his horse in a similar way, Corporal Garforth drew off the enemy fire and enabled the sergeant to get away.

He was taken prisoner in October 1914 and was repatriated in November 1918. He later achieved the rank of sergeant. His VC and other medals are displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London.

Upon his death, Garforth was cremated, and no monument or headstone was laid, as he technically had no grave. This was rectified on 30 August 2008, when a headstone was dedicated to him at Wilford Hill Cemetery in Nottingham, where his ashes were originally scattered.
There is a memorial plaque laid in the pavement in Willesden Green High Street.

<text>Peter Achinstein (born June 30, 1935) is an American philosopher of science at Johns Hopkins University.

== Biography ==
Achinstein is the son of Betty (née Comras) and economist Asher Achinstein. He received his B.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard with a dissertation on Carnap&#x27;s theory of probability. It was the German philosopher Carl G. Hempel, in a visit to Harvard in 1953–4 (replacing W.V. Quine who was on leave), who motivated him to pursue philosophy of science. Upon getting a Harvard Traveling Fellowship, Achinstein spent a year in Oxford in 1959 working under the guidance of P. F. Strawson. In Oxford he attended seminars and lectures delivered by Gilbert Ryle, A. J. Ayer, and J.L. Austin. Achinstein specializes in philosophy of science with strong interests in the history of science.

Achinstein has taught for many years at Johns Hopkins University, where he is currently Krieger-Eisenhower Professor. In Spring 2009, Achinstein began teaching at Yeshiva University as the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein University Professor of Philosophy and is the founder and director of the Center for History and Philosophy of Science of Yeshiva University, New York. He returned to Johns Hopkins in Spring 2011. He has held Guggenheim, NEH, and NSF fellowships, and has served as a visiting professor at MIT, Stanford, Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

He is the author of seven influential books in the history and philosophy of science. Among them are &quot;Particles and Waves&quot;, which shared the prestigious Lakatos Award in 1993. This book is a study of methodological problems arising from three episodes in 19th century physics: the wave-particle debate about light, the development of the kinetic-molecular theory, and the discovery of the electron. In 2001, Achinstein published &quot;The Book of Evidence&quot;, a philosophical and historical study of various concepts of evidence employed in the sciences. A volume of his important collected essays over the years, &quot;Evidence, Explanation, and Realism&quot;, was published in the spring of 2010. A special volume honoring him, &quot;Philosophy of Science Matters: The Philosophy of Peter Achinstein&quot;, was published in 2011. In 2013, Achinstein published &quot;Evidence and Method: Scientific Strategies of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell&quot;. The book &quot;Speculation: Within and About Science&quot;, appeared in 2018. Three of his published papers have been selected for &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Annual,&quot; the best 10 philosophy papers published that year. 

He has three children, Jonathan, Sharon, and Betty. His daughter, Sharon Achinstein, is the Sir William Osler Professor of English at The Johns Hopkins University.

== Former students ==
Many of Professor Achinstein&#x27;s students have gone on in careers as philosophers. Among his best-known students are Alexander Rosenberg, with whom he shared the Lakatos Award, Kent Staley, and Helen Longino.

<text>Guy Antony Chambers (born 12 January 1963) is an English songwriter, musician and record producer, best known for his work with Robbie Williams.

==Education==
Chambers attended Quarry Bank Comprehensive School sixth form in Liverpool. From 18, he studied composition and piano at the Guildhall School of Music, London, where he won the 1985 composition prize.

==Career==
In December 1985, Chambers joined The Waterboys, touring with them on a tour supporting Simple Minds until the end of the year. Chambers joined World Party in 1986. He co-wrote &quot;Love Street&quot; with Karl Wallinger, who he had replaced in The Waterboys, on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Goodbye Jumbo&quot;. He appeared on the Mission&#x27;s album &quot;Carved in Sand&quot;, providing the orchestral arrangement and piano for the song &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;, and was producer for the short-lived group Stress with their debut album.

In 1992, Chambers formed his own band the Lemon Trees and wrote, produced and performed with them until they disbanded in 1995. The band only released one album - &quot;Open Book&quot;. Following the end of The Lemon Trees, Chambers wrote with Cathy Dennis on &quot;Am I the Kinda Girl?&quot; and other albums before meeting Robbie Williams in January 1997. Their first work together, &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot;, was released in September 1997. In the next five years, they produced four other albums: &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot;, &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot;, &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; and &quot;Escapology&quot;. Following 2002&#x27;s &quot;Escapology&quot;, both Williams and Chambers went on to collaborate with other writers and artists for the next ten years, eventually reuniting for 2013&#x27;s &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot;, 2017&#x27;s &quot;The Heavy Entertainment Show&quot; and 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas Present&quot;.

In 2016, Chambers and Williams teamed up with Chris Heath to compose the music and lyrics for the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s musical adaptation of David Walliams’ book &quot;The Boy in the Dress&quot;, which opened in 2019-20 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon. In 2018, Chambers wrote a children’s folk opera based on the Oscar Wilde short story &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot;. He released his debut solo piano album &quot;Go Gentle Into the Light&quot; on 3 May 2019. It reached number 49 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2021, he composed the score and wrote original songs for Sky Cinema&#x27;s &#x27;A Christmas Number One&#x27;.

===Collaboration with Robbie Williams===
Chambers co-wrote a number of Williams&#x27; tracks, including &quot;Rock DJ&quot;, &quot;Feel&quot;, &quot;Millennium&quot;, &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; and &quot;Angels&quot;.

In November 2012, Chambers and Williams were reunited onstage for the latter&#x27;s shows at the O2 Arena.

The release of &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot; was announced by Williams in September 2013. It was released in the UK by Island Records on 18 November. The album featured cover versions of well known songs, as well as six new tracks written by Williams and Chambers, who also produced the album. &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot; also featured duets between Williams and Lily Allen, Michael Bublé, Kelly Clarkson, Olly Murs and Rufus Wainwright. In 2014, Chambers and Williams toured &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot;, covering Europe, Asia and Australia.

In 2015, Chambers joined Williams on the road for the &quot;Let Me Entertain You Tour&quot;. The tour began in Spain and travelled through Europe and Asia, reaching Australia in October. They also played at various festivals throughout the summer. In 2016, Williams and Chambers collaborated on &quot;The Heavy Entertainment Show&quot; which preceded The Heavy Entertainment Show Tour, and in 2019, they collaborated once again on &quot;The Christmas Present&quot;. Chambers co-wrote and produced tracks off &quot;Under the Radar Volume 1, 2 and 3&quot; comprising demos, B-sides and rarities.

===Other collaborations and projects ===
In 2002, Chambers wrote &quot;Staring Into Space&quot; for BBMak&#x27;s second album. In 2003, he co wrote &quot;Melt&quot; with Melanie C on the album &quot;Reason&quot;, which he co-produced along with Richard Flack.

In 2004, Chambers worked with Beverley Knight, co-writing the songs &quot;Affirmation&quot; (also the title track of the album), &quot;No-One Ever Loves in Vain&quot;, &quot;Under the Same Sun&quot; and the top ten single &quot;Come As You Are&quot;. He reunited with Knight on the 2009 album &quot;100%&quot; and co-wrote the title track &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; that Knight duetted on with Chaka Khan. That same year he co-wrote &quot;Shine&quot; with Kara DioGuardi for Hilary Duff. He also co-wrote and co produced &quot;Silent Movie&quot; with Natasha Bedingfield for her album &quot;Unwritten&quot;. In the same year, he co-produced American singer-songwriter Aslyn&#x27;s debut album &quot;Lemon Love&quot;, and co-wrote the song &quot;Here&quot;, and co-wrote 7 songs on Brian McFadden&#x27;s debut album — including the single &quot;Real to Me&quot;, and the follow-up singles &quot;Irish Son&quot; and &quot;Demons&quot;.

In 2007, he co-wrote four songs on Anastacia&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Heavy Rotation&quot;. He teamed up with Christophe Willem on his second record &quot;Cafeine&quot;, co-wrote with Matt Hales from Aqualung on the single &quot;Heartbox&quot; and with Cathy Dennis on &quot;Sensitized&quot;, a duet with Kylie Minogue, for Willem&#x27;s record, released in 2009. Additional work that year involved new work with British artists Julian Perretta, Katie Melua, Random Impulse, Marlon Roudette and Taio Cruz.

In 2010, Chambers began working on the single &quot;World Behind My Wall&quot; released by pop/rock band Tokio Hotel. Chambers also co-wrote Tokio Hotel&#x27;s track, &quot;Pain of Love&quot; which featured on their album, &quot;Humanoid&quot;. Katie Melua&#x27;s album &quot;The House&quot;, released 24 May 2010, included five co-written songs for her new album produced by William Orbit, including &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Kill You&quot;, &quot;The Flood&quot; (first single), &quot;A Happy Place&quot;, &quot;A Moment of Madness&quot; and &quot;Tiny Alien&quot;. Chambers also worked on the track &quot;Virtual Friend&quot;, co-written with Armin van Buuren for his 2010 album, &quot;Mirage&quot;.

In 2011, Chambers worked on new material with English singer-songwriters Katy B and Charlene Soraia. He also teamed up with Example, co-writing the song &quot;Microphone&quot; which featured on Example&#x27;s album, &quot;Playing in the Shadows&quot;. In the same year, Chambers worked with Marlon Roudette, producing and co-writing her single &quot;New Age&quot;. A track Chambers had written with Julian Lennon titled &quot;Never Let You Go&quot; was released on Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Everything Changes&quot;. Chambers collaborated with BBC2 for two three-part programmes: &quot;Goldie&#x27;s Band: By Royal Appointment&quot; airing in April and &quot;Secrets of a Pop Song&quot; which aired throughout July. Through the series, Chambers worked alongside Mark Ronson to create a single, singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright to create a ballad, and British band Noisettes to compose an anthem. Chambers &amp; Wainwright&#x27;s &quot;World War III&quot; features on the digital version of Wainwright&#x27;s album &quot;Out of the Game&quot;.

Chambers has collaborated with Sophie Hunter on two studio albums: the French-language &quot;The Isis Project&quot; (2005) and the English-language &quot;Songs for a Boy&quot; (2011).

In 2013, Chambers collaborated with Maverick Sabre in his new West London studio on new material for the artist, as well as working on new material with Rufus Wainwright, and co-writing &quot;Out of Control&quot; with Miles Kane, a track from Kane&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Who You Are&quot;. In 2014, Chambers wrote &quot;Crying for No Reason&quot; with Katy B. In 2016, Chambers collaborated again with Kylie Minogue, Marlon Roudette, and Rufus Wainwright, and wrote and recorded with John Newman.

In 2019 Chambers collaborated with Robbie Williams on the music and lyrics for RSC stage show &quot;The Boy in the Dress&quot;, the stage adaptation of David Walliams&#x27;s book of the same name.

In 2022, Chambers collaborated with the Austrian musician Trickster on the single &quot;Thank Fuck It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, an expletive-ridden song reflecting the tensions and stress of that year, performed by Trickster alongside the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. They also released a clean version titled &quot;Praise Be It’s Christmas&quot;, which went viral, with several million views on YouTube. Chambers continued to collaborate with Trickster in producing subsequent music tracks, like &quot;Still Kicking&quot; and &quot;&quot;Silent Night&quot; vs &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot;&quot;.

Chambers was portrayed by Australian actor Tom Budge in the 2024 biographical film &quot;Better Man&quot;, based on Robbie Williams&#x27; life and career.

== Charity work ==
On 25 October 2012, Chambers, Steve Rotheram MP and Kenny Dalglish called a press conference in the Houses of Parliament to announce the release of the charity single &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot; – a cover of the Hollies track which was aiming to raise funds and awareness for the campaign for justice for the Hillsborough families who lost 96 loved ones in the football disaster of 1989. The single was released on 17 December 2012 and went on to take the Christmas number one position for 2012 on the UK Singles Chart.

<doc id="1142652" wikidata="Q7120495" url="?curid=1142652" title="Pennsylvania Railroad class K4">
<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad K4 was a class of 425 4-6-2 steam locomotives built between 1914 and 1928 for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), where they served as the primary mainline passenger steam locomotives on the entire PRR system until late 1957.

Attempts were made to replace the K4s, including the K5 and the T1 duplex locomotive. However, the low factor-of-adhesion of K5s meant that they were limited in their pulling power. By contrast, the T1s were very successful but suffered from greater maintenance costs, wheel slip due to poor springing, and inexperienced crews. The T1s also came too late in the game for steam traction. As such, the tried and tested K4s held their role as the PRR&#x27;s primary express passenger locomotives for 30-40 years. The K4s hauled the vast majority of express passenger trains until they were replaced by diesel locomotives. 

The K4s were not powerful enough for the heavier trains they often pulled from the mid-1930s onward, so they were often double-headed or even triple-headed, sometimes with early Atlantics and E6s. This was effective but expensive, and several crews were needed. The PRR did have the locomotives needed for this, many having been displaced by electrification east of Harrisburg. 

The two preserved K4s, Nos. 1361 and 3750, were designated as Pennsylvania&#x27;s official state steam locomotives on December 18, 1987, when Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey signed into law House Bill No. 1211.

==History==
===Development===
By the 1910s, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) were in need of a larger and heavier passenger locomotive to haul their heavier main line passenger trains on their entire system. The result was the K4 class 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot;, which was designed under the supervision of PRR Chief of Motive Power J.T. Wallis, assisted by Chief Mechanical Engineer Alfred W. Gibbs and Mechanical Engineer Axel Vogt, as one of a pair of classes with the L1 class 2-8-2 &quot;Mikado&quot;, sharing the same boiler design and other features. Some inspiration came from the large experimental K29 class &quot;Pacific&quot; built in 1911 by American Locomotive Company (ALCO). Also influential was Gibbs&#x27; design for the successful E6 class 4-4-2 &quot;Atlantic&quot;, from which the K4 class inherited its heat-treated and lightweight machinery, its cast-steel KW trailing truck, and much of its appearance.

No. 1737 was the first K4 class locomotive built in May 1914 at PRR&#x27;s Juniata Shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania with the construction number 2825. The boiler barrel was bigger than previous classes, and the increase in heating surface and boiler size gave the class good steam-generating capability. No. 1737 was conservative and included a screw reverse (power reverse would soon be added); a small 70-P-70 tender holding only of water and 12½ tons of coal, set up for hand-firing; a wooden cowcatcher pilot; a square-cased, old-fashioned headlight and piston tailrods (soon to go).

The K4s design was successful enough that it influenced other locomotive designs, and not only those of other PRR locomotives. London and North Eastern Railway Chief Mechanical Engineer Nigel Gresley incorporated much of the boiler design (including the tapered shape) into his famous Class A1 Pacific.

A World War I-era prototype had distinctive &quot;chicken coop&quot; slat pilots, while the postwar versions had modern pilots.

===Production===

Three years elapsed until production examples were built. Partly, this was due to extensive testing, but wartime necessitated priority in construction to the L1s Mikado type for freight. In 1917, Altoona&#x27;s Juniata Shops started producing K4s in numbers. The first 168 carried widely scattered road numbers, traditional for the PRR, but subsequent locomotives produced after 1920 were numbered in consecutive blocks.

Most of the K-4s were constructed at PRR&#x27;s Juniata Shops, while Nos. 5400-5474 were built by Baldwin

===Modifications===
The PRR experimented extensively with its K4s fleet, trying out streamlining, poppet valves, smoke deflectors, driving wheel types and others.

====Streamlining====
Several K4 locomotives had streamlining applied over the years, to varying degrees. All were later removed, restoring the locomotives to their original appearance.

=====No. 3768=====

Locomotive #3768 was clad in a shroud designed by famed industrial designer Raymond Loewy in February 1936. This was a very concealing, enveloping streamlined casing that hid most of the functionality of the steam locomotive, leading to its nickname of &quot;The Torpedo&quot; by train crews. Clay models of Loewy&#x27;s design streamlined K4s and conventional K4s were tested in a wind tunnel for smoke-lifting ability by Alexander Klemin of the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aeronautics of New York University (CMP). Of 24 variations, 4 were chosen for wind tunnel tests to determine the final design.

At first, the locomotive was not painted in standard Dark Green Locomotive Enamel (DGLE) but instead in a bronze color. It was later refinished in DGLE. A matching tender ran on unusual six-wheel trucks. Like most streamlined steam locomotives, the shrouds impeded maintenance and the covers over the wheels were later removed. For a time, the locomotive was the preferred engine for the Broadway Limited.

=====Nos. 1120, 2665, 3678, and 5338=====

These four locomotives were streamlined in 1940 and 1941 with simpler, closer-fitting casings that hid less of the steam locomotives&#x27; workings, In that sense, they were similar to Henry Dreyfuss&#x27;s casings for NYC Hudsons. According to an interview with John W. Epstein, Special Projects Manager and vice president, Raymond Loewy &amp; Assoc., these four streamlined K4s were designed by Raymond Loewy but, due to WWII, there was no publicity about it. PRR #1120 and #2665 were streamlined in 1940 for the South Wind, a named passenger train equipped and operated jointly by the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (later Seaboard Coast Line) and the Florida East Coast Railway. The South Wind began operations in December 1940, providing streamliner service between Chicago, Illinois, and Miami, Florida.

PRR No. 3678 and No. 5338 were streamlined in 1941 for The Jeffersonian, one of the PRR&#x27;s premier, all-coach trains between New York and St. Louis. They were also seen hauling the Broadway Limited (New York to Chicago), Liberty Limited (Washington to Chicago), and the Trail Blazer (New York to Chicago) occasionally. During World War II, these four locomotives formed a streamlined steam engine fleet within the PRR system, with another five locomotives that were also designed by noted industrial designer Raymond Loewy; they were the PRR S1 #6100, PRR Q1 #6130, T1&#x27;s #6110 and #6111; and K4s #3768. Streamlined shrouding of these four K4s Pacific locomotives was removed after 1950, together with PRR K4s #3678. 
==Accidents and incidents==
* On December 25, 1937, No. 8309 was pulling a passenger train from Columbus, Ohio to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But upon approaching Pittsburgh, the locomotive hits a large piece of rock and derailed off a cliff near Carson Street, killing its engineer and fireman. No. 8309 was badly damaged as a result of the accident, becoming the first K4 locomotive to be written off for scrap in September 1938.
* On the night of February 18, 1947, Nos. 422 and 3771 were double heading the &quot;Red Arrow&quot; passenger train No. 68 from Detroit, Michigan to New York City with fourteen cars behind. At around 3:21 a.m., they both derailed at an excessive speed of at Bennington Curve in Gallitzin, Pennsylvania, killing 22 people, and injuring 138 on board. Both locomotives were total losses and scrapped two months later.
* On the evening of February 6, 1951, No. 2445 derailed in Woodbridge, New Jersey with the &quot;Broker&quot; passenger train No. 733, killing 85 people and injuring 500. The train derailed due to the engineer having trouble looking through the fog along with excessive speed on a temporary trestle due to lack of proper signals. The locomotive was repaired despite extensive damage, only to be retired and scrapped in September 1953.

==Preservation==
There are only two surviving K4s class locomotives:

No. 1361 was being restored to operating condition by the Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona in 1987, but persistent bearing problems ended its operation the following year. The locomotive was moved to the Steamtown National Historic Site and the boiler moved to the East Broad Top shops. The disassembled locomotive lay in pieces for 22 years before the project was officially abandoned in 2010. The Museum cited changes in FRA safety standards and new limits to mainline railway access that would make operation impractical. 
In May 2018, a group of preservationists, engineers and financial backers initiated a new restoration study. The work would include a detailed assessment of the engineering needs and a sustainable operating plan. 
The group plans to replicate a 1940s Pennsylvania Railroad passenger train. It would work with the state&#x27;s educators to give rides at tourist railroads within the state to school children on field trips, thus educating them on the history of how the Pennsylvania Railroad shaped their state.

On June 25, 2021, the Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona announced that it would launch a complete $2.6 million restoration of #1361. The Museum Chairman is Charles &quot;Wick&quot; Moorman, retired Chairman and CEO of Norfolk Southern Railway, and its Board includes Henry Posner III, President of Railroad Development Corporation of Pittsburgh, head of the Posner Foundation and well-known venture capitalist. As of December 2022, a new Belpaire firebox was nearing completion, although with thicker steel and other modifications of the 1914 design in order to comply with current federal safety requirements.
No. 3750 remained on outdoor display at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, outside Strasburg, Pennsylvania. The museum&#x27;s volunteer group plans to have No. 3750 cosmetically restored prior to it being placed in the newly proposed roundhouse exhibit.

<text>Oslo University Hospital, Aker (also known as Aker Hospital or just Aker) is one of the four main campuses of Oslo University Hospital. It was an independent hospital from 1895 to 2009, under the name Aker Hospital and from 2002 Aker University Hospital. Originally established as the municipal hospital of Aker, the hospital became a university hospital affiliated with the University of Oslo in 1948.

==History==

Aker Hospital was founded as a municipal hospital in the municipality of Aker in 1895. Aker municipality was merged with Oslo in 1948; in the same year Aker Hospital became a university hospital affiliated with the University of Oslo. The hospital was owned by the Oslo city government from 1948 to 2002, when it was transferred to the national government along with Ullevål Hospital.

Since January 2002, the hospital was organized as a government-owned health trust and the hospital was renamed Aker University Hospital to reflect its status as a university hospital.

The hospital was responsible for providing health care to 170,000 people residing in the northern part of Oslo as well as the municipalities of Ski, Oppegård, Nesodden, Frogn, Ås and Vestby. It also served as a regional hospital for Norway&#x27;s Health Region East, which includes Oslo, Hedmark, Oppland, Akershus and Østfold counties with a total population of 1.6 million.

<text>The BAe Sea Eagle is a medium-weight sea-skimming anti-ship missile designed and built by BAe Dynamics (now MBDA). It is designed to sink or disable ships up to the size of aircraft carriers in the face of jamming and other countermeasures including decoys. Its users include the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, the Royal Saudi Air Force, and the Indian Navy.

==History==
===Previous systems===
The anti-ship version of the Martel missile entered service with the RAF in October 1972 and the Royal Navy one year later. These missiles were designed around a television guidance system using a camera in the nose of the missile that sent its image back to the launch aircraft via a data link radio system. The weapons officer in the aircraft, normally the Blackburn Buccaneer, used the image to guide the missile via signals sent back to the missile on the same data link. This method of operation had been chosen for its simplicity; in comparison, an active radar seeker would be prone to all sorts of countermeasures, including chaff and active jamming systems, and would require some form of navigation system for the approach while the missile was still under the radar horizon.

The desire for a ship-launched anti-ship missile led to some consideration of an active seeker for the Martel, under the name Ship Martel (or Active Martel). As the launching ship would be under the radar horizon of the target, a data link or similar solution that required a line-of-sight would not work. Marconi won the contract for the radar seeker, a very simple one-axis (left-right) seeker that they claimed would be much less expensive than the Adac seeker of Exocet or the RE576 used on the AS.34 Kormoran and Otomat. A small rocket booster would be used to launch the missile before starting the original engine. This role was ultimately filled by the Exocet and development ended.

The Ship Martel work was later picked up for a submarine-launched anti-ship missile, a project known as CL.137 USGW (Under-Sea Guided Weapon). This consisted of a Sea Martel with modifications to allow it to fit into a normal 21-inch torpedo tube, using folding wings and fins. The Marconi seeker was used, but was not fitted during testing. Instead, a simple autopilot with a radar altimeter was used in testing at Aberporth. A further adaptation was the Sub Martel, otherwise similar but using the Adac seeker from the Exocet, a sub-launched development of the Exocet itself having been abandoned for cost reasons. Ultimately the USGW contest was won by the Sub-Harpoon in September 1975.

===Sea Eagle===

These developments all suggested the TV-guided Martel was no longer competitive, and a series of studies during 1973 to 1975 came up with specifications for its replacement. This was known as Air Staff Target (AST) 1226 in the Air Force, and Naval Staff Target (NST) 6451 in the Navy. This called for a missile with greater range than Ship Martel, which required the switch to a jet engine. Hawker Siddeley submitted a design using the Marconi seeker and a more highly modified version of the Martel airframe. This would have the advantage of being able to be fired from any aircraft already able to fire the TV-guided Martel.

Design of the P3T began in 1976, with full scale development initiated in 1979. Although the resulting design looked like the Martel, almost all components differ, with a longer body, larger wings and totally different internal components. A ship-launched version, the P5T Sea Eagle SL, was proposed in 1981. This added two solid-fuel boosters on either side of the missile body, but was otherwise similar to the P3T. It was designed to be fired from its sealed shipping box. The same box was used for the proposed Lightweight Sea Dart, allowing a ship to carry either or both on the same launcher. One advantage to the SL version over competing designs was that it could be fired at very close targets, while most designs, like Harpoon and Exocet, had a fairly long minimum range. Another advantage was that the same missile could be fired from helicopters, like the original Martel, as the rockets could launch it from the helicopter even at very low altitudes without needing high forward speed to allow the small wings to maintain altitude.

Production of the finished production weapon began in 1982, around the same time that the name Sea Eagle was bestowed, with test firings up to 1984 and service introduction the following year. The RAF Buccaneer was the first aircraft to carry a Sea Eagle in active service. This was followed by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Harrier, as well as the Tornado GR1B in the RAF (replacing Buccaneers) and Royal Saudi Air Force. The Indian Navy also equipped its Sea Harrier FRS Mk.51 and Jaguar IM with the missile, as well as twenty Sea King Mk.42B helicopters, using a version with two booster rockets either side of the rear fuselage. Indian Ilyushin Il-38 maritime patrol aircraft were also equipped with the rocket-boosted version of the missile, carried on unusual side-fuselage pylons aft of each wing. It has also been reported that India sought to equip its Tupolev Tu-142 fleet with the missile. The Chilean Air Force has trial fitted its A-36M Halcon (CASA 101 Aviojet) with the missile, but this combination never entered service. Several variants of the BAE Hawk trainer/light fighter have carried the missile on trials.

The Sea Eagle was withdrawn from service with the RAF and Royal Navy by 2000.

==Design==
Sea Eagle is powered by a licence-built, paraffin-fuelled Microturbo TRI 60 turbojet and cruises at speeds of Mach 0.85 (1,040 km/h, 645 mph) throughout its 110 kilometre (68 mile) plus range. It is capable of being carried at supersonic speeds by its parent aircraft, with launch at speeds of up to Mach 0.9 and a wide range of altitudes. Ejector launch, typically from a Type 119 Mk 5 ERU, with a pylon adapter where needed, is used.

Once launched the Sea Eagle is completely autonomous, with the flight and target seeking completely controlled by the on-board computer system which functions according to programmable options covering a large set of cruise, search and attack options, including a simple, pre-programmed &#x27;point and shoot&#x27; mode that allows it to be carried by basic aircraft without radar, using targeting information radioed to the pilot from external sources or even visually located by him, with the missile&#x27;s short minimum range assisting this. Other modes integrate with more sophisticated weapon systems and sensors and allow Sea Eagle to be programmed during flight by the parent aircraft using targeting data from the aircraft&#x27;s on board radar sensors or via off-board data-link networks. &#x27;Dog leg&#x27; routes can be programmed into the missile&#x27;s computer to allow a salvo of missiles to arrive from different directions, saturating the target&#x27;s defences. A twin-gyro attitude reference system, digital flight control computer and autopilot are used to give the missile an over-the-horizon capability. A C-band radar altimeter allows the missile to fly at very low level, minimising the range at which a ship can detect it. The J-band active radar target seeker can detect targets up to 30 km away, allowing a mid-course update of target position through a &#x27;pop up&#x27; manoeuvre if required. The guidance system was developed by GEC-Marconi at Stanmore.

The main wings are essentially of delta form, arranged in a cruciform configuration. Smaller tails surfaces of similar shape and configuration provide steering. The engine intake is under the fuselage - whilst carried by an aircraft this is covered by an aerodynamic fairing which is blown clear at launch. The missile is fitted with a powerful semi-armour-piercing warhead, with a high ratio of charge to total weight, encased in a tough metal alloy casing. Residual turbojet fuel adds to the warhead&#x27;s destructive effects on impact with the target.

Sea Eagle is stored as a &#x27;round of ammunition&#x27;, with inspection every two years or so, and a life of at least 15 years. When stored the wings and tail surfaces are removed, but the weapon can be kept fully fuelled.

==Variants==
A variant of the missile, called Sea Eagle SL (also P5T), designed to be launched from boxes mounted on ships was tested. It used the same rocket boosters as applied to the helicopter-launched version, but lost out to the American Harpoon missile in a 1984 competition to arm the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 22 Batch 3 and Type 23 frigates. This version was also intended to have been used in shore-based batteries. The only external difference from the air-launched version was the use of launcher shoes for rail mounting in the launch box, as opposed to the air-launched version&#x27;s ejector lugs.

An unbuilt air-launched, land attack version of Sea Eagle, using a similar nose radar and semi-armour-piercing warhead, was known as P4T. A later proposed land attack variant which would have had an imaging infrared or millimetre wave radar seeker-head and a data link to allow the launch platform to update the missile in flight was studied around 1990; this version was dubbed &quot;Golden Eagle&quot; and would have had a penetrator warhead to allow attacks on land-based hardened targets.

A proposed update of Sea Eagle in the mid-1990s with a dual-band seeker and improved systems was abandoned on cost grounds.

<text>Psychological Review is a bimonthly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers psychological theory. It was established by James Mark Baldwin (Princeton University) and James McKeen Cattell (Columbia University) in 1894 as a publication vehicle for psychologists not connected with the laboratory of G. Stanley Hall (Clark University), who often published in his &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot;. &quot;Psychological Review&quot; soon became the most prominent and influential psychology journal in North America, publishing important articles by William James, John Dewey, James Rowland Angell, and many others.

According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2020 impact factor of 8.934.

The journal has implemented the Transparency and Openness Promotion guidelines that provide structure to research planning and reporting and aim to make research more transparent, accessible, and reproducible.

==History==
In the early years of the 20th century, Baldwin purchased Cattell&#x27;s interest in the journal, but was forced to sell the journal to Howard Warren in 1908 when scandal forced him out of his professorship at Johns Hopkins University (where he had moved in 1903). Editorship of the journal fell to Baldwin&#x27;s newly hired young colleague John B. Watson, who used the journal to advance his school of behaviorism. &quot;Psychological Review&quot; was eventually sold by Warren to the American Psychological Association, which has owned it ever since.

<text>Cordtex is a type of detonating cord generally used in mining. &quot;Cordtex&quot; and &quot;Primacord&quot; are two of many trademarks which have slipped into use as a generic term for detonating cord.

It uses an explosive core of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) inside its plastic coating. It is commonly the thickness of electrical extension cord and has a detonation velocity of approximately 6000–7000 metres per second. It is used to &quot;daisychain&quot; a sequence of explosives together.

It can also be used in short lengths in simple boobytraps and early warning devices.

<doc id="1142702" wikidata="Q295315" url="?curid=1142702" title="Miguel Monteiro">
<text>Luís Miguel Brito Garcia Monteiro (born 4 January 1980), known simply as Miguel (), is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a right-back or a winger.

He spent the vast majority of his career with Benfica (five seasons) and Valencia (seven), appearing in 161 official matches for the first club and 239 for the second while winning four major titles.

Miguel earned 59 caps for Portugal in the 2000s and represented the country at two World Cups and as many European Championships.

==Club career==
===Early years and Benfica===
Born in Lisbon of Bissau-Guinean and Cape Verdean descent, Miguel started his senior career with local C.F. Estrela da Amadora as a winger, having previously spent five years at Sporting CP&#x27;s youth system and being released for being too short. On 30 April 1999, he made his first-team debut by playing 17 minutes in a 2–1 away loss against Boavista FC, then added 28 Primeira Liga appearances in his only full season as the capital club retained its top-division status.

Miguel moved to S.L. Benfica in summer 2000, making the transition to right midfielder and then right-back (by the hand of former Benfica player Fernando Chalana, in his only game as a transition coach) – the position that ultimately brought him international recognition. In the 2004–05 campaign, he contributed 22 matches and two goals to a national championship conquest after an 11-year wait.

===Valencia===
Miguel joined Valencia CF in August 2005, for a €7.5 million fee. Fully established as first choice, he signed a new five-year deal in September 2007, and helped the &quot;Che&quot; to win the Copa del Rey the following year, playing in the final 3–1 win against Getafe CF.

In 2009–10, Miguel was challenged by new signing Bruno. He still appeared in 25 matches as Valencia finished third and returned to the UEFA Champions League.

In May 2012, following several occasions where he displayed unprofessional behaviour, Miguel&#x27;s contract expired and he was released. In 2014, he started practising with the SJPF (syndicate of professional football players) alongside other unemployed players to regain fitness.

==International career==
A Portugal international since making his debut against Italy on 12 February 2003, Miguel was a member of the squad when the country hosted UEFA Euro 2004. Initially a backup to Paulo Ferreira, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari made him the starting right-back in a reorganised defence after a 2–1 loss to Greece in the opening game; he withdrew injured in the first half of the final, a 1–0 defeat to the same team.

Miguel started every match at the 2006 FIFA World Cup before going off with an injury in the 1–0 semi-final loss against France. He backed up José Bosingwa in Euro 2008, and only appeared in the 2–0 group stage defeat to co-hosts Switzerland.

Picked for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa – in spite of an irregular season at Valencia – Miguel was one of three right-backs used during Portugal&#x27;s four games in the competition, appearing in the group stage 7–0 win over North Korea. In September 2010, the 30-year-old announced his retirement from international duty.

<doc id="1142711" wikidata="Q202162" url="?curid=1142711" title="Aba, Nigeria">
<text>Aba is a city in southeastern Nigeria and the commercial centre of Abia State. Aba South is the main city centre of Aba and Abia State at large, being located on the Aba River. Aba is made up of many villages such as Aba-Ukwu, Eziukwu-Aba, Obuda-Aba, Umuokpoji-Aba and other villages that have been merged for administrative convenience. It lies along the west bank of the Aba River and is at the intersection of roads leading to Port Harcourt, Owerri, Umuahia, Ikot Ekpene, and Ikot-Abasi.

Aba was established by the Ngwa clan of the Igbo people in Nigeria as a market town. Later, a military post was placed there by the British colonial administration in 1901. The city became a collection point for agricultural products following construction of a British-made railway running through it to Port Harcourt. Aba is a major urban settlement and commercial centre in Abia State, which is surrounded by small villages and towns. The indigenous people of Aba are the Ngwa. Aba is well known for its craftsmen and is the most populous city in southeastern Nigeria. , Aba had an estimated population of 2,534,265, making it the biggest city in South Eastern Nigeria.

==History==
Aba, although acting as a unified city, is composed of many urban and rural towns, including Aba-Ukwu, Eziukwu-Aba, Obuda-Aba and Umuokpoji-Aba. Aba-Ukwu has historically been the primary village in Aba, as the Eze W.E Ukaegbu of Aba-Ukwu was known and referred to as the 9th Grand Son of Aba. However, the greater Aba metropolis as defined by the Greater Aba Development Authority (GADA) comprises seven local government areas, namely Aba South, Aba North, Osisioma Ngwa, Obingwa, Ugwunagbo, Ukwa East, and Ukwa West. 

The city was initially a trade centre which eventually became an administrative centre of Britain&#x27;s colonial government. Aba has been a major commercial centre ever since it became part of British Nigeria.

The Aro Expedition, which was part of a larger military plan to quell anti-colonial sentiment in the region, took place in the area of Aba between 1901 and 1902. During this military action, the British defeated the native Aro people with a presumably large number of casualties. In 1901, the British founded a military post in Aba and in 1915, a railroad was constructed to link it to Port Harcourt, which transported agricultural goods such as palm oil and palm kernels. 

In 1929, Aba was the site of a revolt by Igbo women, historically known as &quot;The Aba Women&#x27;s Riot&quot;, which was a protest against the colonial taxation policy. The riot started as a peaceful protest against the initial census of women in the region and subsequent assumed taxation of the women based upon rumours. The protests spread throughout the region, but remained peaceful until a pregnant woman was knocked over during a &quot;scuffle&quot;, and the lady lost her child. News of this &quot;act of abomination&quot; spread rapidly, and violent reactions ensued. After more protests, a mass of 10,000 women marched on Aba. Sources dispute the casualty rate, with 55 to over 100 deaths being reported. By the 1930s, Aba was becoming a large urban community with an established industrial complex.

During the height of the Nigerian Civil War in 1967, the capital of Biafra was moved to Umuahia from Enugu. Aba was a very strategic Biafran city and was heavily bombed and air-raided during the Civil War.

Upon the creation of Abia State in 1991, the old Aba township was divided into two local government areas, being Aba South and Aba North, while the suburban neighborhood of what was then known as Obioma Ngwa L.G.A. was divided into three L.G.A.s (namely Osisioma Ngwa, Obingwa and Ugwunagbo) for administrative convenience.

Aba is the home of many distinguished families such as the Emejiaka Egbu family of Aba la Ohazu, the Ogbonna family of Eziukwu-Aba, the Ichita family of Umuokpoji-Aba, the Omenihu family of Obuda-Aba, the Ugbor family of Aba-Ukwu, the Ugwuzor family Umuokpoji Aba, the Ihemadu family of Ohabiam, the Ukaegbu family of Aba-ukwu, the Ahunanya family of Ohabiam, among others.

==Economy==
Aba is surrounded by oil wells, which separate it from the city of Port Harcourt. A long pipeline provides Aba with gas from the Imo River natural gas repository. Its major economic contributions are textiles and palm oil, along with pharmaceuticals, plastics, cement, and cosmetics. This trade makes the Ariaria International Market the second largest market in Nigeria after the Onitsha Main Market. There is also a Heineken N.V., a glass-working company and a brewery within the city. Aba is famous for its handicrafts. There are ongoing construction projects in Enyimba Economic Area and Abia State Industrial Innovation Park in Ukwa East and West local government areas to overcome the challenges of unplanned urban sprawl facing the city.

Aba is a commercial hub of eastern Nigeria. There are a few well-known markets, such as Ariaria International Market, Ahia Ohuru Market, and Eziukwu Road Market, among others, that serve the entire region with wares, food, cosmetics, and other material goods.

==Religion==
The city has played a lasting role in the Christian evangelism of Southeast Nigeria ever since the British brought over the Church Mission Society (CMS), an evangelism vehicle of the Church of England used to plant what today has become the Anglican Church of Nigeria. The evangelist church known as All the Saints originated out of the initiative of three oil traders: Opopo-Joseph Cookey, Gabrial Cookey and Zedekiah Cookey. These men sailed up the Aba River in 1896 for trade and to spread Christianity. In 1897, they negotiated with the Abayi and Umuocham people for land to establish their oil business; these negotiations were successful. As their oil trade began to grow, so too did Christianity in Nigeria, and the Cookeys ended up converting the Abayi and Umuocham people to Christianity. From 1901 and especially in 1902, they planned an intensive crusade and invited their landlords. This led to the construction of two congregational churches; one at the Abayi waterfront, and the other at the Umuocham waterfront, dedicated by James Johnson. The earliest converts from the Abayi and Umuocham tribes attended church services at St. Ambrose on the Abayi waterfront until 1905, when they set up their own churches further inland. Joseph Cookey was the volunteer teacher for the Abayi, whereas Gabriel Cookey was the volunteer teacher for the Umuocham.

St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral Anglican Church was founded in the late 1920s, although St. James Parish on the Umuleri city limit is arguably the oldest church in the region due to the fact that the diocese&#x27;s first mass was celebrated in 1916. Most of the primary and secondary schools mentioned below were founded by the CMS along with their associated churches.

Early missionaries who arrived in Nigeria in 1842 established what is now known as the Methodist Church of Nigeria in Badagry. Methodism quickly spread to Uzuakoli and down to Aba. Wesley Cathedral was the first cathedral to be built in Aba. It became a diocese and later an archdiocese which hosted the 2018 Methodist Conference. The Methodist Church is one of the most spiritually vibrant churches in the city of Aba.

The Catholic Church also created many churches; Christ the King Church (C.K.C), which for a long time was the biggest church in the city, became its bishop&#x27;s seat, and it is now known as Christ the King Cathedral.

With the arrival of the Pentecostal brand of Christianity in Nigeria, the city got an enormous share for itself. The Assemblies of God Church and Deeper Christian Life Ministry had massive followings in the early 1980s, followed by the Refiner&#x27;s House International Church, one of the newest and fastest-growing Christian ministries in the city. The African Gospel Church was founded by Bishop Ogudoro. This church is divided into 10 districts. The current bishop of the African Gospel Church is Rev. Dr. Robert Lang&#x27;at.

In the late 1960s, a group of Nigerians discovered information on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and established branches, but this Utah-based church did not establish any official presence in Nigeria until 1978. The first stake of this church in Nigeria (and in fact in all of Africa outside of South Africa) was established in Aba in 1988, with David W. Eka as president. There are presently four LDS stakes headquartered in Aba and the only LDS temple in Nigeria is located in the city, being the Aba Nigeria Temple. There are three other temples announced for Lagos, Benin City, and Eket.

Mosques are also present in Aba; the largest mosque is the Hospital Road Mosque. A Chief Imam resides in the Hausa-speaking settlements at the heart of the city.

==Education==
Below are some schools in Aba.



==Transport==
Aba is served by a station on Nigerian Railways, but this station is rarely used. Aba is also a major hub for road transport in the region—a large number of transport companies operate coaches that transport people daily to various parts of the country. The city is second only to Onitsha in mass transportation daily volume within eastern Nigeria. Commercial motorcycles have been banned in the region and are being replaced by commercial tricycles popularly referred to as Keke and a minibus service. This minibus service is a popular means of transportation nowadays.

In 2012, a monorail system was proposed for the city. The plan was criticised as a potential scam, as the private company involved in the project had no experience in developing monorails. As of 2021, there is no information that the proposal progressed past the signing of a memorandum of understanding.

==Sports==
Enyimba F.C., popularly called &quot;The Peoples Elephant&quot;, is the city&#x27;s most popular association football club. Enyimba F.C.&#x27;s winning record is among the highest of all Nigerian football clubs. With two CAF Champions League trophies, six Nigeria Premier League titles and a pair of Nigerian Federation Cup trophies, the club is currently ranked second in the CAF Club rankings.

== Waste management ==
The management of waste in Aba is primarily overseen by the Abia State Environmental Protection Agency (ASEPA). Although faced with significant challenges that are compounded by rapid urbanization and population growth the recent administration of Dr Alex Otti has had much greater success in solving waste management in the city, with one refuse dumps being cleared all over the city.

==Source of electricity==

Aba is powered by the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company, which was created by the division of the Nigerian Electricity Power Authority. In 2024, another electrical company called Geometric Power Company was inaugurated by the Nigerian President Bola Tinubu on Saturday February 24th. Aba Power Limited Electric, the newest electricity distribution company (DISCO), in Nigeria, is expected to take electricity from the new plant and supply to 9 of the 17 Local Government Areas of Abia State which includes Aba. It is expected that the daily hours of available electricity in the city will rise, and the electric generator will become a household item. For some places in Aba, an electric generator will be the only source of electricity due to remoteness or other factors.

== Climate ==
Aba has a mainly tropical climate. Most months of the year see significant rainfall, and the brief dry season has little impact. The weather in the region is classified as Am in the Köppen climate classification system. Aba&#x27;s yearly mean temperature is . The annual precipitation of the city clocks in to about .

Due to Aba&#x27;s proximity to the equator, the city is in a summer-like state most of the year. January, February, March, April, May, November, and December are the ideal months to travel.

<doc id="1142712" wikidata="Q3985614" url="?curid=1142712" title="The Age of Intelligent Machines">
<text>The Age of Intelligent Machines is a non-fiction book about artificial intelligence by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. This was his first book and the Association of American Publishers named it the &quot;Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990&quot;. It was reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. The format is a combination of monograph and anthology with contributed essays by artificial intelligence experts such as Daniel Dennett, Douglas Hofstadter, and Marvin Minsky.

Kurzweil surveys the philosophical, mathematical and technological roots of artificial intelligence, starting with the assumption that a sufficiently advanced computer program could exhibit human-level intelligence. Kurzweil argues the creation of humans through evolution suggests that humans should be able to build something more intelligent than themselves. He believes pattern recognition, as demonstrated by vision, and knowledge representation, as seen in language, are two key components of intelligence. Kurzweil details how quickly computers are advancing in each domain.

Driven by the exponential improvements in computer power, Kurzweil believes artificial intelligence will be possible and then commonplace. He explains how it will impact all areas of people&#x27;s lives, including work, education, medicine, and warfare. As computers acquire human level faculties Kurzweil says people will be challenged to figure out what it really means to be human.

==Background==

Ray Kurzweil is an inventor and serial entrepreneur. In 1990 when this book was published he had already started three companies: Kurzweil Computer Products, Kurzweil Music Systems, and Kurzweil Applied Intelligence. The companies developed and sold reading machines for the blind, music synthesizers, and speech recognition software respectively. Optical character recognition, which he used in the reading machine, and speech recognition are both featured centrally in the book as examples of pattern recognition problems. After the publication of &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; he expanded on its ideas with two follow-on books: &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot; and the best selling &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot;.

==Content==

===Definition and history===
Kurzweil starts by trying to define artificial intelligence. He leans towards Marvin Minsky&#x27;s &quot;moving frontier&quot; formulation: &quot;the study of computer problems which have not yet been solved&quot;. Then he struggles with defining intelligence itself and concludes &quot;there appears to be no &quot;simple&quot; definition of intelligence that is satisfactory to most observers&quot;. That leads to a discussion about whether evolution, the process, could be considered intelligent.

Kurzweil concludes that evolution is intelligent, but with an IQ only &quot;infinitesimally greater than zero&quot;. He penalizes evolution for the extremely long time it takes to create its designs. The human brain operates much more quickly, evidenced by the rate of progress in the last few thousand years, so the brain is more intelligent than its creator. Kurzweil concludes from this that there is no theoretical reason why the human brain cannot create something more intelligent than itself, and suggests &quot;a sufficient number of decades or centuries into the future&quot; humans will in fact be surpassed by their creations.

The field of artificial intelligence presupposes that the human brain is a machine, and that an alternative implementation could be built, as a computer program, which would have the same faculties as the real thing. Kurzweil traces the philosophical underpinnings of this tenet, as well as the opposing view that properties such as consciousness and free will are unique to the human mind. Kurzweil starts with Plato and touches quickly on Descartes, Newton, Kant, Wittgenstein and ends with Hubert Dreyfus. Kurzweil also presents the mathematical roots of artificial intelligence including contributions by Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, and Kurt Gödel. The Turing test is introduced as a way to gauge whether the field of artificial intelligence has succeeded or not.

===Chess and pattern recognition===
Kurzweil discusses how computers play chess in detail, building to his prediction that &quot;we will see a [computer] world champion by the year 2000&quot;. The Chinese strategy game of go, however, has proven much more difficult for computers to play well. He considers go to be a &quot;level 3&quot; problem, the type of problem where there is no single unifying formula which solves it. Then Kurzweil reveals that pattern recognition, which is crucial to artificial intelligence, is also a level 3 problem.

Kurzweil traces various ways of doing pattern recognition, from the rise and fall of perceptrons to random neural nets and decision trees, finally explaining that intelligence is a hierarchy of heterogeneous processes &quot;communicating and influencing each other&quot;. He believes Marvin Minsky&#x27;s &quot;Society of Mind&quot; and Jerome Lettvin&#x27;s society of neurons are useful models. Kurzweil differentiates logical thinking from pattern recognition, and explains that AI has had much more trouble with pattern recognition, exemplified by efforts to create artificial vision.

Kurzweil estimates that the human vision system does the equivalent of 100 trillion multiplications per second where &quot;a typical personal computer&quot; of the day could only do 100,000 multiplications per second. The way out of this dilemma is parallel processing, having millions or billions of simultaneous processes all computing at the same time, something Kurzweil felt would happen in the future. Kurzweil also discusses speech recognition, which like vision requires complex pattern recognition.

===Knowledge and art===

In addition to pattern recognition, representative knowledge is also an important aspect of intelligence. Kurzweil details several types of expert systems in medicine, insurance and one for garage mechanics. Knowledge is expressed by language and Kurzweil discusses the state of language understanding including projects such as Terry Winograd&#x27;s SHRDLU. Kurzweil says robotics is where all AI technologies are used: &quot;vision, pattern recognition, knowledge engineering, decision-making, natural-language understanding and others&quot;. He explains how robots are increasingly successful in structured environments like factories, and predicts that &quot;effective robotic servants in the home will probably not appear until early next century&quot;.

As a high school student Kurzweil built a computer which could compose music and demonstrated it on the national TV show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. In &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; he discusses the relationship between artificial intelligence and the production of music and visual art by computers. He includes the freehand drawings of AARON as well as plotter art by Colette Bangert and Charles Bangert. He briefly mentions artificial life, shows a number of computer generated fractals, and writes that &quot;the role of the computer is not to displace human creativity but rather to amplify it.&quot;

===Impact===
Kurzweil explains that the &quot;functionality per unit cost&quot; in the computer industry has been increasing exponentially for decades. He says computer memory costs one one-hundred millionth of what it did in 1950, for example. Kurzweil admits exponential trends do not last forever, but is convinced computer power could increase by millions of times beyond the 1990 level. If these trends continue, Kurzweil argues, we will see a &quot;translating telephone&quot; by 2010, intelligent assistants by the mid-1990s, and a &quot;completely driverless car&quot; by &quot;well into the first half&quot; of the 21st century. He anticipates we will prove our identity by finger and voice prints and that artificial people will be present as holograms or robots.

Kurzweil goes into detail about the Turing test and explains that &quot;sometime between 2020 and 2070&quot; the test will be passed to such a degree that &quot;no reasonable person familiar with the field&quot; will question the result. 
Even as artificial intelligence replaces whole industries, Kurzweil insists there will still be a net gain of jobs. He says fields like &quot;communication, teaching, learning, selling, strategic-decision making and innovation&quot; will continue to be staffed by humans. At work he predicts people will use electronic documents that will be a &quot;web of relationships&quot; like Ted Nelson&#x27;s hypertext instead of linear like a book.

As far as education Kurzweil feels children will have portable computers on which to run &quot;intelligent and entertaining courseware&quot;. Papers, exams, electronic mail and even &quot;love notes&quot; will be sent over wireless networks. All the advanced capability will alter the domain of warfare as well, leading to laser and particle beam weapons, and planes without human pilots. Medicine will entail computer diagnosticians, coordinated data banks of patient histories, realistic simulations for drug designers, and robotically assisted surgery. This leaves humans open to do research, organize knowledge and administer &quot;comfort and caring&quot;.

Handicapped individuals will be greatly assisted by the advancing technology with reading machines, hearing machines, and robotic exoskeletons. Kurzweil believes the prejudice the handicapped now suffer will abate with their new abilities. Kurzweil concludes the book by explaining that all of these advances will challenge us; as computers do ever more tasks that used to be our sole domain, as our intelligence is rivaled and then eclipsed by machines, he feels we will need to figure out what makes us human.

==Style==
Sprinkled throughout the book are 23 essays, 4 of them by Kurzweil himself and 19 others by invited authors: Margaret Litvin, Daniel Dennett, Mitchell Waldrop, Sherry Turkle, Blaine Mathieu, Seymour Papert, Douglas Hofstadter, Marvin Minsky, Edward Feigenbaum, Jeff Pepper, K. Fuchi, Brian Oakley, Harold Cohen, Charles Ames, Michael Lebowitz, Roger Schank and Christopher Owens, Allen Newell, Margaret Boden, and George Gilder. The book closes with a &quot;chronology&quot; listing events from the age of the dinosaurs to the year 2070, fifty pages of end notes and suggested readings, a glossary and an index.

==Reception==
Jay Garfield in the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that Kurzweil is &quot;clear, current and informative&quot; when writing about areas he has worked directly in, but &quot;sloppy and vague&quot; when talking about philosophy, logic and psychology. Of the prediction for a &quot;translating telephone&quot; by the first decade of the 21st century, Garfield says Kurzweil overlooks &quot;the mammoth difficulties that confront anyone who tries to accomplish such a task&quot;.

&quot;The Futurist&quot; calls it an &quot;impressive volume&quot; which is &quot;handsomely illustrated&quot; and &quot;a feast for the mind and eye&quot;., while Simson Garfinkel in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; says &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; is &quot;a tour de force history of artificial intelligence&quot; yet laments that &quot;although the book is orderly, it is not organized&quot; and complains that &quot;details are missing throughout&quot;.

Linda Strauss, writing for &quot;Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values&quot;, calls the book &quot;a rich assemblage of glittering parts, rather awkwardly joined&quot;. She points out that Kurzweil really cannot define artificial intelligence, the subject of the book, because he cannot define intelligence. Instead he relies on the Turing test and on Marvin Minsky&#x27;s notion of intelligence as a moving horizon of unsolved problems. Strauss feels Kurzweil does not consider the cultural and societal implications of his futuristic visions.

<text>Penyberth () was a farmhouse at Penrhos, on the Llŷn Peninsula near Pwllheli, Gwynedd, which had been the home to generations of patrons of poets, and also a way-station for pilgrims to Bardsey Island, but destroyed in 1936 in order to build a training camp and aerodrome for the RAF.

== History ==

=== Background ===

Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK government settled on establishing the RAF Penrhos bombing school at Penyberth on the Llŷn peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest, known as &quot;Tân yn Llŷn&quot; (&quot;Fire in Llŷn&quot;), helped define &quot;Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru&quot; (National Party of Wales). The UK government settled on Llŷn as the site for its new bombing school after similar locations in Northumberland and Dorset were met with protests.

However, UK Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against the bombing school in Wales, despite a deputation representing half a million Welsh protesters. Protest against the bombing school was summed up by Saunders Lewis when he wrote that the UK government was intent upon turning one of the &#x27;essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature&#x27; into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare. Construction of the bombing school building began exactly 400 years after the first part of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 which brought Wales into the same legal jurisdiction and administrative state as the rest of the Kingdom of England.

=== Fire and sentencing ===

On 8 September 1936, three Plaid Cymru members, dramatist and lecturer Saunders Lewis, poet and preacher Lewis Valentine and novelist DJ Williams, set fire to the bombing school and then went to give themselves up at Pwllheli police station, in accordance with Gandhian principles. Legend has it that they then spent the evening discussing poetry with the duty sergeant. The trial at Caernarfon failed to agree on a verdict and the case was sent to the Old Bailey in London. The &quot;Three&quot; were sentenced to nine months imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs, and on their release they were greeted as heroes by fifteen thousand Welsh at a pavilion in Caernarfon.

=== Public response ===
Many Welsh people were angered by the judge&#x27;s scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty. Dafydd Glyn Jones wrote of the fire that it was &quot;the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock.&quot;

=== Symbolism ===

This incident is known in the Welsh language as (The bombing school burning) or (Fire in Llŷn), and has attained iconic status in Welsh nationalist circles.

=== Current use ===
Penyberth was the site of the Wakestock contemporary music festival from 2000 to 2014.

<text>In cryptography, FROG is a block cipher authored by 
Georgoudis, Leroux and Chaves. The algorithm can work with any block size between 8 and 128 bytes, and supports key sizes between 5 and 125 bytes. The algorithm consists of 8 rounds and has a very complicated key schedule. 

It was submitted in 1998 by TecApro, a Costa Rican software company, to the AES competition as a candidate to become the Advanced Encryption Standard. Wagner et al. (1999) found a number of weak key classes for FROG. Other problems included very slow key setup and relatively slow encryption. FROG was not selected as a finalist.

==Design philosophy==
Normally a block cipher applies a fixed sequence of primitive mathematical or logical operators (such as additions, XORs, etc.) on the plaintext and secret key in order to produce the ciphertext. An attacker uses this knowledge to search for weaknesses in the cipher which may allow the recovery of the plaintext. 

FROG&#x27;s design philosophy is to hide the exact sequence of primitive operations even though the cipher itself is known. While other ciphers use the secret key only as data (which are combined with the plain text to produce the cipher text), FROG uses the key both as data and as instructions on how to combine these data. In effect an expanded version of the key is used by FROG as a program. FROG itself operates as an interpreter that applies this key-dependent program on the plain text to produce the cipher text. Decryption works by applying the same program in reverse on the cipher text.

==Description==

The FROG key schedule (or internal key) is 2304 bytes long. It is produced recursively by iteratively applying FROG to an empty plain text. The resulting block is processed to produce a well formatted internal key with 8 records. FROG has 8 rounds, the operations of each round codified by one record in the internal key. All operations are byte-wide and consist of XORs and substitutions.

FROG is very easy to implement (the reference C version has only about 150 lines of code). Much of the code needed to implement FROG is used to generate the secret internal key; the internal cipher itself is a very short piece of code. It is possible to write an assembly routine of just 22 machine instructions that does full FROG encryption and decryption. The implementation will run well on 8 bit processors because it uses only byte-level instructions. No bit-specific operations are used. Once the internal key has been computed, the algorithm is fairly fast: a version implemented using 8086 assembler achieves processing speeds of over 2.2 megabytes per second when run on a 200 MHz Pentium PC.

==Security==
FROG&#x27;s design philosophy is meant to defend against unforeseen/unknown types of attacks. Nevertheless, the very fact that the key is used as the encryption program means that some keys may correspond to weak encryption programs. David Wagner et al. found that 2−33 of the keys are weak and that in these cases the key can be broken with 258 chosen plaintexts. 

Another flaw of FROG is that the decryption function has a much slower diffusion than the encryption function. Here 2−29 of keys are weak and can be broken using 236 chosen ciphertexts.

<doc id="1142736" wikidata="Q17505" url="?curid=1142736" title="Same-sex marriage in California">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in California since June 28, 2013. The State of California first issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples from June 16, 2008 to November 5, 2008, a period of approximately 4 months, 2 weeks and 6 days, as a result of the Supreme Court of California finding in the case of &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot; that barring same-sex couples from marriage violated the Constitution of California. The issuance of such licenses was halted from November 5, 2008 through June 27, 2013 (though existing same-sex marriages continued to be valid) due to the passage of Proposition 8—a state constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriages. The granting of same-sex marriages recommenced following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;, which restored the effect of a federal district court ruling that overturned Proposition 8 as unconstitutional.

Before the passage of Proposition 8, California was only the second U.S. state (after Massachusetts) to legalize same-sex marriage. Those marriages granted under the laws of other state governments, foreign and domestic, were legally recognized and retained state-level rights since 2008. On November 12, 2008, Connecticut obtained the distinction of being the second U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage. Following the reinstatement of same-sex marriage rights in 2013, California was the tenth U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage. On November 5, 2024, California voters passed Proposition 3, a constitutional amendment that enshrined the right to same-sex marriage in the state constitution. The measure passed by 63%.

==History==

From February 12 to March 11, 2004, under the direction of Mayor Gavin Newsom, officials in San Francisco issued marriage licenses to approximately 4,000 same-sex couples despite it being illegal to do so at both the state and federal level. During the month that licenses were issued, couples traveled from all over the United States and from other countries to be married. On August 12, citing Newsom&#x27;s lack of authority to bypass state law, the Supreme Court of California ruled that the marriages were void. Consolidated lawsuits against the state government in favor of same-sex marriage eventually reached the Supreme Court of California. On May 15, 2008, it overturned the state&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage with its ruling &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;. The four-to-three decision took effect on June 16, 2008. Two weeks earlier, an initiative to override this result of the court decision qualified for the November election ballot. The court declined to stay its decision until after the November elections. Some reports suggested that out-of-state same-sex couples would marry in California prior to the 2008 elections because California does not require the marriage to be valid in the couple&#x27;s home state.

The ballot initiative, Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment titled &quot;Eliminates Right of Same-Sex Couples to Marry Act&quot;, appeared on the California general election ballot on November 4, 2008 and passed with a 52% majority. One supporter of Proposition 8 was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which donated $20 million to campaign for its passage. The California Supreme Court heard several challenges to Proposition 8 in March 2009, but ultimately upheld the amendment, though the over 18,000 same-sex marriages that were performed before the amendment was passed remained valid.

In the wake of Proposition 8&#x27;s passage, California continued to allow domestic partnerships. This granted same-sex couples almost all state-level rights and obligations of marriage, but did not apply to &quot;federal-level rights of marriage that cannot be granted by states.&quot; Before Proposition 8 passed, the Williams Institute projected in June 2008 that about half of California&#x27;s more than 100,000 same-sex couples would wed during the next three years and 68,000 out-of-state couples would travel to California to exchange vows.

On August 4, 2010, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker declared Proposition 8 a violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution in &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot;, a decision upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 7, 2012. The case, known as &quot;Perry v. Brown&quot; in the Ninth Circuit, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 31, 2012. The case was granted review as &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; on December 7, 2012 and a decision was issued on June 26, 2013. The court decided that the official sponsors of Proposition 8 did not have legal standing to appeal the district court decision when the state&#x27;s public officials refused to do so. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit was vacated and the case was returned to that court with instructions to dismiss the appeal. On June 28, 2013, a stay of execution was lifted and same-sex marriages were able to resume. Same-sex couples began marrying later that day.

==Legislation==
===Assembly Bill 607 (1977)===
From the enactment of legislation in 1971 to replace gendered pronouns with gender-neutral pronouns until 1977, the California Civil Code defined marriage as &quot;a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary.&quot; This definition was uniformly interpreted as including only opposite-sex partners, but, because of worries that the language was unclear, &quot;Assembly Bill 607&quot;, authored by Assemblyman Bruce Nestande, was proposed and later passed in 1977 to &quot;prohibit persons of the same sex from entering lawful marriage&quot;.

Fears that the Civil Code would allow marriage between parties of the same sex had arisen due to a couple in Orange County who sought a marriage license after the passage of legislation which repealed the criminality of homosexuality in California in 1976. The Orange County Clerks Association submitted a call to Nestande to clarify the law as it pertained to same-sex couples. The act amended the Civil Code to define marriage as &quot;a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman, to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary&quot;. Opponents of the bill included Assemblyman Willie Brown and Senator Milton Marks. The bill passed 23–5 in the California State Senate and 68–2 in the Assembly. It was signed into law on August 17, 1977 by Governor Jerry Brown. The section was repealed in 2015.

Legislation (known as &quot;AB 167&quot;), authored by Assemblyman John Burton, in 1991 would have deleted gender requirements. It failed to garner enough votes for passages and died in the Assembly. The bill was supported by the San Francisco Bar Association, which had issued a statement in favor of same-sex marriage in 1989, and the California Lawyers Association.

===Proposition 22 (2000)===
Following Senator William J. Knight&#x27;s failure to pass anti-marriage legislation on two different occasions in 1995 and 1997 in the California State Legislature, Proposition 22 was created as an initiative statute to add section 308.5 to the Family Code, largely replicated the 1977 language.

In the March 7, 2000 primary election, Proposition 22 was adopted by a vote of 61% to 39%, thus adding section 308.5 to the Family Code, largely replicating the 1977 enactment. The one-sentence code section explicitly defined &quot;the union of a man and a woman as the only valid or recognizable form of marriage&quot; in California. Proposition 22 was authored by Senator Knight, and the measure was dubbed the &quot;Knight initiative&quot; in an attempt to link it to the failed Briggs Initiative of 1978 that would have banned gays and lesbians from working as teachers in California&#x27;s public schools. The California Supreme Court invalidated the results of Proposition 22 in 2008.

Proposition 22 was formally cited as &quot;The California Defense of Marriage Act&quot;.

===Passage of same-sex marriage legislation (2005–2007) ===
When California State Legislature opened the 2005–2006 session, Assemblyman Mark Leno introduced &quot;Assembly Bill 19&quot; (&quot;AB 19&quot;), which proposed legalizing same-sex marriage. The bill gained the support of Speaker Fabian Núñez among others. Leno had introduced a similar bill in the prior session, but it died in committee. Assembly committees reported out &quot;AB 19&quot; favorably, but the measure failed on the Assembly floor on June 2, 2005. Later that month, Assemblywoman Patty Berg amended the text of her fisheries-research measure, &quot;Assembly Bill 849&quot; (&quot;AB 849&quot;), which was already in the Senate, to the text of Leno&#x27;s failed bill.

On September 2, 2005, the California Senate approved the bill 21–15, and on September 6 the California State Assembly followed suit with a vote of 41–35, making the California State Legislature the first in the nation to approve a same-sex marriage bill without court pressure. The next day, September 7, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger indicated he would veto the bill, citing Proposition 22, which had passed with the approval of a majority of voters five years earlier. The State Legislature avoided physically delivering the bill to Governor Schwarzenegger for over two weeks, during which time advocacy groups urged him to change his mind. Ultimately, the bill was delivered on September 23 and vetoed on September 29, 2005. Schwarzenegger said he believed that same-sex marriage should be settled by the courts or another vote by the people via a statewide initiative or referendum. He argued that the State Legislature&#x27;s bill simply complicated the issue, as the constitutionality of Proposition 22 had not yet been determined, and its ultimate disposition would render &quot;AB 849&quot; either unconstitutional (being in conflict with a valid voter initiative) or redundant (being guaranteed by the California Constitution itself, as construed by the courts).

Shortly after the newly-elected Assembly was sworn in, Leno resubmitted a similar bill on December 4, 2006. The bill was passed by the State Legislature in early September 2007, giving Governor Schwarzenegger until October 14, 2007 to either sign or veto the bill. Schwarzenegger had stated months before that he would veto the bill on the grounds that the issue at hand had already been voted on by California voters by way of Proposition 22. Schwarzenegger followed through on his statement and on October 12, 2007 he vetoed the bill. He wrote in his veto statement that to solve the issue of same-sex marriage, the California Supreme Court needed to rule on the constitutionality of Proposition 22.

===Proposition 8 (2008)===

Months before the California Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, groups who opposed same-sex marriage began circulating initiative petitions. One petition, titled the &quot;California Marriage Protection Act&quot; by its proponents and the &quot;Limit on Marriage&quot; amendment by the California Attorney General on the actual ballot, gathered an estimated 764,063 valid signatures and qualified for the November 4, 2008 ballot as Proposition 8. The measure would add Section 7.5 to Article I of the Constitution of California. It would supersede the part of the Supreme Court&#x27;s holding that authorized the granting of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Twelve other proposed amendments since 2004 had failed to qualify to be on the ballot. The ability of the voters to remove a fundamental constitutional right by initiative amendment was challenged. A lawsuit filed on those grounds asking for the removal of Proposition 8 from the ballot was dismissed on July 16, 2008.

On the day after the election, the results remained uncertified. With 100% of precincts reporting, the vote was 52.47% in favor of Proposition 8 and 47.53% opposed, with a difference of about 504,000 votes; as many as 3 million absentee and provisional ballots remained to be counted. The organizers of the &quot;No on Prop 8&quot; campaign conceded defeat on Thursday, November 6, issuing a statement saying, &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s vote was deeply disappointing to all who believe in equal treatment under the law.&quot;

On Wednesday, November 5, 2008, three lawsuits were filed, challenging the validity of Proposition 8 on the grounds that revoking the right of same-sex couples to marry was a constitutional &quot;revision&quot; rather than an &quot;amendment&quot;, and therefore required the prior approval of two-thirds of each house of the California State Legislature. Plaintiffs in the various suits included same-sex couples who had married or planned to marry, the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles and Santa Clara County. The California Supreme Court heard several challenges to Proposition 8 and on May 26, 2009 upheld the proposition but did not overturn previous same-sex marriages which occurred following their ruling in June 2008 and before November 5, 2008. Same-sex marriage supporters considered trying to get another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition 8 on the ballot in the 2012 election, but decided to wait. To this day, Proposition 8 remains part of the California Constitution despite its unconstitutionality.

===The Marriage Recognition and Family Protection Act (2009)===
On October 12, 2009, following the passage of Proposition 8, Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law &quot;The Marriage Recognition and Family Protection Act&quot;, legislation proposed by Senator Leno. The bill established that some of the same-sex marriages performed outside the state are also recognized by the state of California as &quot;marriage&quot;, depending on the date of the union.

On May 26, 2009, the California Supreme Court affirmed that all same-sex marriages performed in California before the passage of Proposition 8 would continue to be valid and be recognized as &quot;marriage&quot;. &quot;The Marriage Recognition and Family Protection Act&quot; also established that a same-sex marriage performed outside the state would be recognized as &quot;marriage&quot; if it occurred before Proposition 8 took effect. This category also included same-sex marriages performed before same-sex marriage became legal in California. It also mandated the full legal recognition of same-sex marriages lawfully performed outside of California after the passage of Proposition 8, with the sole exception that the relationship could not be designated with the word &quot;marriage&quot;. The law provided no label to be used in place of &quot;marriage&quot; to describe these relationships; they were not &quot;domestic partnerships&quot;. The resumption of same-sex marriage in California on June 28, 2013 effectively supersedes this law with respect to out-of-state same-sex marriages.

===Senate Bill 1306 (2014)===
Introduced by Senator Mark Leno on February 21, 2014, &quot;Senate Bill 1306&quot; would repeal the 1977 legislation, &quot;The Marriage Recognition and Family Protection Act&quot;, and Proposition 22. The legislation would remove the statutory reference to marriage as a union &quot;between a man and a woman&quot; from the Family Code and update the law with gender-neutral terms to apply to same-sex marriages as well as different-sex ones. During its passage, some concern was expressed that, by repealing Proposition 22, &quot;SB 1306&quot; breached the separation of powers as the State Legislature would be repealing an initiative passed by the voters. However, the consensus of the Assembly Judiciary Committee was that the voters are no more able to pass an unconstitutional, and subsequently enjoined, statute anymore than the State Legislature can. In light of &quot;In Re Marriage Cases&quot; and &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;, which collectively forbade the enforcement of any law which would prohibit same-sex couples from marrying, the committee determined that the State Legislature has the capacity to repeal enjoined statutes.

&quot;SB 1306&quot; was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee 5–2 on April 8, 2014. On May 1, 2014, the Senate passed the bill on a 25–10 vote. On June 30, it passed the Assembly in a 51–11 vote. It was signed by Governor Brown on July 7 and took effect on January 1, 2015. The statute definition of marriage in California is now the following:
In April 2016, the State Senate voted 34–2 to approve &quot;Senate Bill 1005&quot;, introduced by Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, that updated California law similarly to &quot;SB 1306&quot;. The Assembly approved the bill by a vote of 63–1 with amendments. The bill went back to the Senate for the amendments&#x27; approval, and it was passed by 34 votes to 0. It was signed into law by Governor Brown, and took effect on January 1, 2017.

===Proposition 3 (2024)===

Following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, in June 2022, a group of state lawmakers, including representatives Scott Wiener and Evan Low, said they had prepared a draft bill to repeal Proposition 8 from the California Constitution. The group sought to have a measure put on the November 2024 ballot for approval by voters. Senate President Toni Atkins said, &quot;The door will be opened to undermine all of those rights.&quot;, in response to the decision to overrule &quot;Roe&quot;. Wiener and Low introduced the bill to the State Legislature in February 2023.

On June 26, 2023, the California Assembly voted 67–0 to approve a constitutional amendment repealing the text of Proposition 8 and replacing it with the following: &quot;The right to marry is a fundamental right.&quot; On July 13, 2023, the California Senate voted unanimously 31–0 to approve the amendment and refer it to the November 2024 ballot for approval by the electorate. The measure was approved by 62.6% of voters.

==Court challenges==

===Trial court decision===
In February 1993, Benjamin and Marcial Cable-McCarthy submitted an application for a marriage license to the Los Angeles County Clerk&#x27;s Office, but it was rejected. They had previously changed their names to Cable-McCarthy. Their lawsuit against the Clerk&#x27;s Office, filed in April 1993, was the first case challenging California&#x27;s laws on same-sex marriage. However, the case was dismissed by the 2nd District State Court of Appeal in Los Angeles on May 22, 1993. The case, &quot;Cable-McCarthy v. California&quot;, was then denied a review on appeal by the California Supreme Court. Rather than pursue the case further, the couple chose to await a resolution in &quot;Baehr v. Miike&quot;, a Hawaii case on the legality of same-sex marriage, which subsequently lost in the Hawaii Supreme Court in 1999.

In &quot;Smelt v. Orange County&quot;, Arthur Smelt and Christopher Hammer, a same-sex couple together for 8 years, sued in federal court, challenging the federal &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; (DOMA) and Proposition 22. Judge Gary L. Taylor of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ruled against the couple in June 2005, upholding the federal law and declining to consider the California law. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case on appeal in May 2006, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied review on October 10, 2006.

San Francisco and numerous individuals sued the state of California seeking to overturn Proposition 22, the state law that limited marriage to opposite-sex couples. Among the different cases were &quot;City and County of San Francisco v. State of California&quot;, &quot;Tyler vs. State of California&quot;, filed by two same-sex couples, &quot;Woo and Chung v. Lockyer&quot;, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and three more. All challenged the state&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage. Five of the cases were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court and one case in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. Eventually, all six cases were coordinated (&quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;) and assigned to San Francisco Superior Court Judge Richard Kramer. On March 14, 2005, Judge Kramer ruled that California statutes limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples were unconstitutional. The court held there was no rational connection between forbidding same-sex marriage and any legitimate state interest and the opposite-sex requirements impermissibly discriminated based on gender.

===Appellate court decision===
The state and organizations opposed to same-sex marriage appealed. Division Three of the First District Court of Appeal held extended oral arguments on the cases on July 10, 2006, before a three-judge panel. In a 2-to-1 decision, the appellate court overturned the lower court. Writing for the majority, Presiding Justice William R. McGuiness found: The marriage statutes do not discriminate based on gender; the state&#x27;s interests in &quot;preserving the traditional definition of marriage&quot; and &quot;carrying out the expressed wishes of a majority of Californians&quot; were sufficient to preserve the existing law; and challenges from the two groups opposed to same-sex marriage had to be dismissed because they lacked standing in any actual controversy on which the court could rule.

The majority emphasized that it was not the role of the court to determine whether the &quot;traditional definition&quot; of marriage should be maintained. &quot;The time may come when California chooses to expand the definition of marriage to encompass same-sex unions,&quot; McGuiness wrote. &quot;That change must come from democratic processes, however, not by judicial fiat.&quot; In a sharply worded dissent, Justice J. Anthony Kline (Presiding Justice of Division Two, sitting by designation because two justices had recused themselves) described the court&#x27;s reasoning as &quot;circular&quot;. He wrote that the majority&#x27;s indifference to the reasons why marriage is a fundamental right unintentionally &quot;diminish the humanity of the lesbians and gay men whose rights are defeated&quot;. Both justices in the majority commented at length on Justice Kline&#x27;s dissent.

===Supreme Court of California review===
In November 2006, several parties petitioned the Supreme Court of California to review the decision. Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. In December 2006, the Supreme Court voted unanimously to review all six cases and held oral arguments on March 4, 2008, consolidating the cases as &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;.

On May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court struck down California&#x27;s statutes limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples in a 4–3 ruling. The judicial ruling overturned the anti-marriage law which the State Legislature had passed in 1977 and Proposition 22. After the ruling, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a statement repeating his pledge to oppose Proposition 8, the ballot initiative that would override the ruling.

The opinion, written by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, cited the court&#x27;s 1948 decision in &quot;Perez v. Sharp&quot; where the state&#x27;s interracial marriage ban was held unconstitutional. It found that &quot;equal respect and dignity&quot; of marriage is a &quot;basic civil right&quot; that cannot be withheld from same-sex couples, that sexual orientation is a protected class like race and gender, and that any classification or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the California State Constitution. Associate Justices Joyce L. Kennard, Kathryn Werdegar, and Carlos R. Moreno concurred. It was the first state high court in the country to do so. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, by contrast, did not find sexual orientation to be a protected class, and instead voided its same-sex marriage ban on a rational basis review in &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; in 2003.

After the announcement, the Advocates for Faith and Freedom and the Alliance Defense Fund, &quot;inter alia&quot;, asked for a stay of the ruling. In a one-page order on June 4, 2008, the court denied all petitions for rehearing or to reconsider the May 15 ruling and rejected moves to delay enforcement of the decision until after the November election, when Californians would vote on a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision. As a result, same-sex marriages took place starting in mid-June. Chief Justice George and Justices Kennard, Werdegar and Moreno voted for the resolution, while dissenting or voting to reconsider the judgment, were Justices Marvin R. Baxter, Ming Chin and Carol Corrigan. The order stated, &quot;The decision filed on May 15, 2008, will become final on June 16, 2008, at 5 p.m..&quot; San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that marriages would be held starting at 5:01 p.m. on June 16. The final stage of the case was the issuance of a writ of mandate by the Superior Court to the Registrar of Vital Statistics on June 19, 2008.

===Legal challenges to Proposition 8===

On June 20, 2008, gay rights groups filed suit with the California Supreme Court seeking to remove the initiative from the November ballot; their lawsuit was later dismissed on July 16, 2008. They argued that the changes would constitute a revision to the California Constitution, which requires a two-thirds vote of the State Legislature before being placed before voters, rather than a mere amendment, which does not require involvement by the State Legislature. They further argued that the original petitions, which were circulated before the May 15 court decision, were misleading because the petitions said the initiative would not change the marriage laws and would have no fiscal impact.

Prior to the election date, backers of Proposition 8 also filed a lawsuit after Attorney General Jerry Brown changed the title of the initiative from &quot;Limit on Marriage&quot; to &quot;Eliminates the Right of Same-Sex Couples to Marry&quot;. On August 8, 2008, Superior Court Judge Timothy Frawley ruled that &quot;The Attorney General did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the chief purpose and effect of the initiative is to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry&quot;, so the new name would appear on the ballots.
On the day of the &quot;Strauss v. Horton&quot; decision on May 26, 2009–in which the Supreme Court of California upheld Proposition 8 as a lawful amendment of the State Constitution–the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge the validity of Proposition 8 under the U.S. Constitution in a case known as &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot;. Judge Vaughn Walker ordered a full trial which began in January 2010. It addressed questions as wide-ranging as whether being gay diminishes one&#x27;s contribution to society, affects one&#x27;s ability to raise children, impairs judgment, or constitutes a mental disorder. Judge Walker ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, violating both the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution, and on August 12, 2010, had scheduled to deny a motion to stay the ruling throughout the appeals process. On August 16, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the motion to stay, ordered expedited briefing on the merits of the appeal, and directed the parties to brief the issue of why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of standing. On August 17, the same Ninth Circuit panel ordered expedited briefing on the Imperial County appeal. The court also ordered both appeals calendared for oral arguments during the week of December 6, 2010 in San Francisco. On February 7, 2012, in a 2–1 decision, a three judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Perry v. Brown&quot;, which it stayed pending appeal. Proponents of Proposition 8 appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 31, 2012, and the court granted &quot;certiorari&quot; on December 7, 2012 as &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;. On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Proposition 8 supporters did not have standing for their appeal, and thus ordered the Ninth Circuit to void their ruling, leaving Walker&#x27;s decision standing. The Ninth Circuit lifted its stay on June 28, allowing same-sex marriages to proceed in California once again. Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, two of the plaintiffs in &quot;Perry&quot;, were married shortly afterward at San Francisco City Hall, making them the first same-sex couple to be married in California since Proposition 8 was overturned. The officiant was the Attorney General of California, Kamala Harris.

Opponents of same-sex marriage filed an emergency petition on June 29 asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the lifting of the stay issued by the Ninth Circuit. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy denied the petition on June 30.

===Further legal challenges to the scope of the injunction barring enforcement of Proposition 8===
Proposition 8 proponents argued that the district court&#x27;s injunction was applicable only to the two couples who were the plaintiffs in the case or, at most, applied to the two counties whose clerks were named as defendants. Attorney General Kamala Harris, however, issued an analysis that the district court&#x27;s injunction applies statewide and is binding upon all 58 of California&#x27;s counties based on the interpretation of California Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Lockyer v. City and County of San Francisco&quot;, stating that county clerks are state officials under supervision of the California Department of Public Health for the limited purpose of issuing marriage licenses and are thus bound by the injunction. Governor Brown then directed all county clerks to comply with district court ruling.

On July 12, 2013, Proposition 8 proponents petitioned the California Supreme Court in &quot;Hollingsworth v. O&#x27;Connell&quot;, invoking the court&#x27;s original jurisdiction under Article VI of the California Constitution, asking the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandate and an immediate stay or injunction ordering county clerks to enforce Proposition 8. Arguing that the district court lacked authority to grant relief beyond the named plaintiffs or, even if the district court had such authority, its injunction only applied to the two county clerks who were named defendants. They also argued that Article III of California Constitution prohibits administrative officials from declaring a law unconstitutional or unenforceable or refusing to enforce the law unless an appellate court has made such a determination. Since the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; held that Proposition 8 proponents lacked legal standing to appeal the district court&#x27;s decision, the decision of the Ninth Circuit was vacated with no legal effect or precedent.

The California Supreme Court ordered the parties to brief on the merits and whether the stay should be issued, and on July 15 it denied the application for a stay. On July 19, San Diego County Clerk Ernest J. Dronenburg Jr. filed a petition, &quot;Dronenburg v. Brown&quot;, asking for the California Supreme Court to halt the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples, which the court denied on July 23. He later withdrew his petition on August 2. On August 14, 2013, the Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of mandate. The last attempt to resume Proposition 8 failed and the case is now closed.

In November 2021, the Ninth Circuit agreed to release to the public unsealed videos from the Proposition 8 trial. Supporters of Proposition 8 had argued the videos should remain sealed, but the Ninth Circuit ruled that they lacked standing because they failed to show they would suffer a concrete injury if the videos were made public. The Supreme Court denied review without comment on October 11, 2022. &quot;While it is great news that the recordings of this landmark trial have finally been made public, it never should have taken 12 years to get them unsealed.&quot;, said a spokesman for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

==Legality of 2004 San Francisco marriages==

City officials in San Francisco claimed that although the 2004 marriages were prohibited by state law, the state law was invalidated by the Equal Protection Clause. Mayor Gavin Newsom echoed this view, permitting the marriages because he believed the state law was unconstitutional. However, legislators and groups opposing same-sex marriages quickly reacted, filing a suit and requesting a court order to prevent the city from performing the ceremonies. Additionally, the California state agency that records marriages stated that altered forms, including any marriage license issued to same-sex couples, would not be registered. In &quot; Lockyer v. City and County of San Francisco&quot;, the Supreme Court ordered San Francisco to stop performing same-sex marriages pending court review on the legality of the marriages on March 11, 2004, and ultimately voided all the marriages on August 12, 2004.

Officials in Berkeley and Oakland, in nearby Alameda County, expressed interest in joining San Francisco, but were unable to do so because marriage licenses are handled at a county, rather than at a city, level. San Francisco was able to issue its own licenses because San Francisco is both a city and a county.

==Native American nations==
California is home to hundreds of indigenous peoples, many of whom have traditions of two-spirit individuals who were born male but wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed everyday household work and artistic handiwork which were regarded as belonging to the feminine sphere. This two-spirit status allowed for marriages between two biological males or two biological females to be performed among some of these tribes. Same-sex marriage is legal on the reservations of the Blue Lake Rancheria, the Colorado River Indian Tribes, and the Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel. The latter was the first tribe in California to legalize same-sex marriage when they announced in the wake of the &quot;Perry&quot; ruling in June 2013 that they would allow same-sex couples to marry on their reservation. &quot;Although the Tribe has certainly come far, they won&#x27;t ever forget the sting of prejudice, or stand passively by when others suffer discrimination or denial of basic human rights. Native Americans have fought hard to establish and protect their own rights, and Santa Ysabel is determined to support our own, and other same sex couples in their struggle to be recognized and treated fairly as citizens of this great nation&quot;, said Virgil Perez, the tribal chairman. The Yurok Tribe has a gender-neutral marriage ordinance that defines marriage as &quot;the union of two individuals by any ceremony or practice recognized under Yurok law, and includes marriages according to Yurok custom and tradition.&quot; The Karuk Tribe also has a gender-neutral marriage law.

===Two-spirit marriages===
The Luiseño, an indigenous people living from the present-day southern part of Los Angeles County to the northern part of San Diego County, have traditionally recognized two-spirit individuals who wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed everyday household work and artistic handiwork which were regarded as belonging to the feminine sphere. They are known in their language as (). The &quot;kwit&quot;, known as &quot;robust workers&quot;, married cisgender men, and were sometimes wives in polygynous chieftain households. The Mohave people of Southern California refer to two-spirit individuals who crossed out of the masculine gender as (). The &quot;ʼalyha&quot; married men and were regarded as &quot;especially diligent wives&quot;, often sought out by shamans. They were spiritually important for the tribe as they were considered great healers, as were the (), individuals who were born female but wore men&#x27;s clothing and performed men&#x27;s activities. The &quot;hwame&quot; married women, and could claim paternity of a child if they married a pregnant woman. Living together with an &quot;ʼalyha&quot; or a &quot;hwame&quot; followed the same patterns as did the establishment and dissolution of opposite-sex marriages. The Chumash people who live in modern-day Santa Barbara County call two-spirit people (). They &quot;live[d] as women, and kept company with them&quot;, and married cisgender men. The Salinan call them (). They &quot;lived as women, associated with them, wore the same dress [...] and enjoyed great consideration among their companions&quot;, married men, and also helped with raising young girls in the tribe. The &quot;coya&quot; were violently persecuted by Spanish colonizers, with explorer Pedro Fages ordering the execution of several &quot;coya&quot; in 1769, and they gradually disappeared with the Spanish missions in California. Among the Yokuts of the San Joaquin Valley, two-spirit individuals are known as (). They were the &quot;leaders of the mourning ceremony held immediately after the death&quot;, though would only take the &quot;profession if they had received instructions to do so in a dream&quot;. The &quot;tonocim&quot; were spiritually important for the tribe, but generally did not marry men or women. The Mono people call them (), and the Kawaiisu call them ().

Among the numerous Native American cultures of the North Coast, two-spirit individuals would generally remain unmarried. The Yurok refer to two-spirit people as (). They were said to have been &quot;impelled by the desire to become shamans&quot;, a profession generally reserved to women. In the Kashaya language, two-spirit people are known as (). They performed women&#x27;s activities such as basket weaving. Edward Winslow Gifford wrote in 1926 of a Pomo two-spirit, &quot;Many men associated with him for short periods, some sleeping with him. None married him permanently.&quot; The Yuki people, who live in modern-day Mendocino County, refer to two-spirit individuals as (). The &quot;íwamusp&quot; wore women&#x27;s clothing, performed women&#x27;s activities, were tattooed like women, and lived with and married men. The Cahto people, who live at the head of the South Fork Eel River, call two-spirit individuals (). They married men, and were known for their basket weaving. An anthropologist noted in 1942 that a Cahto man &quot;may make coarse baskets without reflecting on his masculinity but a male maker of fine baskets is suspected of homosexual tendencies&quot;. The Nomlaki, native to the Sacramento Valley, call them (). They reportedly &quot;pound[ed] acorns, gather[ed] seeds, and act[ed] like women&quot;. The Plains and Sierra Miwok refer to two-spirit individuals as (), and the Nisenan refer to them as (). Both would marry men.

Among the Shasta people, who live in present-day Siskiyou County, two-spirit individuals, known as (), wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed the occupations of both sexes. They generally remained unmarried and lived independent lives, forming relationships with neither men nor women. The Modoc people refer to two-spirit individuals as (). The &quot;tʼwiniˑqʼ&quot; wore women&#x27;s clothing and &quot;behaved as women&quot;. They married cisgender men, and usually took the role of a shaman and were credited with great spirital power. In the Achumawi language, they are known as (). They were said to have &quot;special functions in connection with burial festivities&quot;, and would traditionally marry men. Two-spirit people held a similar status and position in Atsugewi society where they are known as (). Among the Yana people, two-spirit people had &quot;male genitals [but] dressed like women and did all kinds of women&#x27;s work. They were not ridiculed, on the other hand, they were shamans.&quot; They are known as (). In Tolowa, two-spirit is translated as ().

==Demographics and marriage statistics==
Data from the 2000 U.S. census showed that 92,138 same-sex couples were living in California. By 2005, this had increased to 107,772 couples, likely attributed to same-sex couples&#x27; growing willingness to disclose their partnerships on government surveys. Same-sex couples lived in all counties of the state, and constituted 1.4% of coupled households and 0.8% of all households in the state. Most couples lived in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego counties, but the counties with the highest percentage of same-sex couples were San Francisco (2.70% of all county households) and Sonoma (1.23%). Same-sex partners in California were on average younger than opposite-sex partners, and more likely to be employed. In addition, the average and median household incomes of same-sex couples were higher than different-sex couples, but same-sex couples were far less likely to own a home than opposite-sex partners. 18% of same-sex couples in California were raising children under the age of 18, with an estimated 37,311 children living in households headed by same-sex couples in 2005.

Marriage licenses were issued to 4,037 same-sex couples in 2004 in San Francisco before the California Supreme Court issued its stay. During the same period, the San Francisco City Hall issued 103 opposite-sex marriage licenses. Of those same-sex marriage licenses issued, 82 couples either decided not to go through with a marriage or failed to register their marriage with the county before the California Supreme Court stay was issued, meaning 3,955 completed same-sex marriages were registered in the county. By reviewing the first names of the applicants, San Francisco officials estimated that 57% of the same-sex married couples were women. Demographic information gleaned from the registered licenses also showed that the newlywed same-sex couples were older: more than 74% were over age 35, while 69% had at least one college degree. According to figures released on March 17, 2004 by San Francisco County Assessor Mabel Teng, although 91.4% of the licenses were granted to couples living in California, other couples came from every state in the United States except for Maine, Mississippi, West Virginia and Wyoming. The top five states represented included 32 couples each from Washington and Oregon, 24 from Nevada, 20 from New York and 16 from Florida. International same-sex couples, 17 in all, came from Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.

==Timeline==
*February 12, 2004: Mayor Gavin Newsom and other city officials began issuing marriage licenses in San Francisco. Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were the first same-sex couple to be married. The event was intended to undercut a legal challenge planned by the Campaign for California Families (CCF).
*March 9, 2004: The San Jose City Council, by a vote of 8–1, agreed to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions for city employees. 
*March 11, 2004: The Supreme Court of California issued a stay ordering San Francisco to stop performing same-sex marriages pending court review on the legality of the matter. Mayor Newsom agreed to abide by the order. The ruling did not alter a scheduled March 29 San Francisco Superior Court hearing before Judge Ronald Quidachay in which the Campaign for California Families and the Alliance Defense Fund claimed that San Francisco&#x27;s granting of same-sex marriage licenses was illegal. Quidachay later delayed the hearing pending action by the California Supreme Court.
*May 25, 2004: The California Supreme Court held hearings on the legality of the marriages. San Francisco had wanted its case heard first by lower courts rather than by the state Supreme Court. However, the court suggested that San Francisco could file its own suit against the state, and the city launched such a suit that afternoon.
*August 12, 2004: The state Supreme Court released its decision, exactly six months after the first same-sex marriages were performed in San Francisco. The court ruled unanimously that San Francisco had exceeded its authority and violated state law by issuing the marriage licenses. In a 5–2 decision, the court also declared all same-sex marriages performed in San Francisco to be void, while expressing no opinion on the constitutionality of marriage restrictions. 
*March 14, 2005: In the case of &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;, Judge Richard Kramer of the San Francisco County Superior Court ruled that California&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.
*May 15, 2008: The California Supreme Court released its decision in &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;, applying strict scrutiny to the state&#x27;s discrimination between heterosexual and homosexual citizens. Marriage was found to be a fundamental right that may not be denied based on sexual orientation, and the relevant laws were struck down.
*June 16, 2008: Same-sex marriage became legal in California. Counties started issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples during regular hours on June 17.
*November 4, 2008: Proposition 8 was passed by California voters. Same-sex marriages were no longer legal from November 5, 2008.
*May 23, 2009: &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot; was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge the validity of Proposition 8 on behalf of two same-sex couples.
*May 26, 2009: The California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8 in &quot;Strauss v. Horton&quot;, but did not overturn previous same-sex marriages.
*August 4, 2010: U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker declared the ban unconstitutional but stayed his ruling pending appeal.
*August 5, 2010: Both sides submitted legal briefs to Judge Walker arguing for or against a long-term stay of the ruling.
*August 7, 2010: Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who had vetoed same-sex marriage legislation on two earlier occasions, and Attorney General Jerry Brown, both filed motions with Judge Walker, urging him not to stay his ruling any longer. Lawyers representing Schwarzenegger wrote, &quot;The Administration believes the public interest is best served by permitting the court&#x27;s judgment to go into effect, thereby restoring the right of same-sex couples to marry in California.&quot;
*August 12, 2010: Judge Walker scheduled to lift his stay for same-sex marriages to resume during the appeals process, but instead issued a stay until August 18 to allow opponents to file an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
*November 17, 2011: The California Supreme Court ruled, in &quot;Perry v. Brown&quot;, that sponsors of Proposition 8 have the right to defend the initiative in court, allowing the case to be heard in the Ninth Circuit.
*February 7, 2012: A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit ruled, 2–1, that the ban on same-sex marriage in California was unconstitutional. The court stayed its decision pending an expected appeal.
*June 5, 2012: A request for an &quot;en banc&quot; rehearing of the Ninth Circuit decision was denied.
*July 31, 2012: Proponents of Proposition 8 filed a petition for a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision.
*December 7, 2012: The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s finding that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. 
*June 26, 2013: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the appellants lacked legal standing under federal law. It ordered the Ninth Circuit to void their ruling, leaving Walker&#x27;s decision standing. The Supreme Court also overturned Section 3 of the federal &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; that same day.
*June 28, 2013: The Ninth Circuit lifted its stay, allowing same-sex marriages to proceed in California. Governor Jerry Brown instructed all California county clerks to immediately begin issuing marriage licenses, and the first same-sex marriages since 2008 were performed.
*June 29, 2013: Opponents of same-sex marriage filed an emergency petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the lifting of the stay issued by the Ninth Circuit.
*June 30, 2013: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy denied the petition.
*July 12, 2013: Proposition 8 supporters petitioned the California Supreme Court to order enforcement of Proposition 8 in the majority of the state&#x27;s counties, arguing that Judge Walker had no jurisdiction to bar statewide enforcement, that his decision was binding only with respect to either the specific couples involved, or just the two counties in which those couples resided. They argued that California law requires continued enforcement until a ruling of an appeals court, and that of the Ninth Circuit decision had been vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court.
*July 15, 2013: The California Supreme Court declined to immediately halt same-sex marriages in response to the July 12 petition but announced it would hear briefs on the merits of the argument.
*July 19, 2013: San Diego County Clerk Ernest J. Dronenburg Jr. petitioned the California Supreme Count to immediately halt same-sex marriages based on arguments similar to those of the July 12 petition.
*July 23, 2013: The California Supreme Court declined to immediately halt same-sex marriages in response to the July 19 petition.
*August 2, 2013: The petition in &quot;Dronenburg v. Brown&quot; to halt same-sex marriages filed on July 19 was withdrawn.
*August 14, 2013: In a one-page order, the California Supreme Court denied a writ of mandate on the July 12 petition without comment, rejecting the last legal challenge to same-sex marriage in California.

The hebesphenomegacorona is named by in which he used the prefix &quot;hebespheno-&quot; referring to a blunt wedge-like complex formed by three adjacent &quot;lunes&quot;—a square with equilateral triangles attached on its opposite sides. The suffix &quot;-megacorona&quot; refers to a crownlike complex of 12 triangles. By joining both complexes together, the result polyhedron has 18 equilateral triangles and 3 squares, making 21 faces.. All of its faces are regular polygons, categorizing the hebesphenomegacorona as a Johnson solid—a convex polyhedron in which all of its faces are regular polygons—enumerated as 89th Johnson solid formula_1. It is an elementary polyhedron, meaning it cannot be separated by a plane into two small regular-faced polyhedra.

The surface area of a hebesphenomegacorona with edge length formula_2 can be determined by adding the area of its faces, 18 equilateral triangles and 3 squares
formula_3
and its volume is formula_4.

<text>In geometry, the sphenomegacorona is a Johnson solid with 16 equilateral triangles and 2 squares as its faces.

== Properties ==
The sphenomegacorona was named by in which he used the prefix &quot;spheno-&quot; referring to a wedge-like complex formed by two adjacent &quot;lunes&quot;—a square with equilateral triangles attached on its opposite sides. The suffix &quot;-megacorona&quot; refers to a crownlike complex of 12 triangles, contrasted with the smaller triangular complex that makes the sphenocorona. By joining both complexes, the resulting polyhedron has 16 equilateral triangles and 2 squares, making 18 faces. All of its faces are regular polygons, categorizing the sphenomegacorona as a Johnson solid—a convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons—enumerated as the 88th Johnson solid formula_1. It is an elementary polyhedron, meaning it cannot be separated by a plane into two small regular-faced polyhedra.

The surface area of a sphenomegacorona formula_2 is the total of polygonal faces&#x27; area—16 equilateral triangles and 2 squares. The volume of a sphenomegacorona is obtained by finding the root of a polynomial, and its decimal expansion—denoted as formula_3—is given by . With edge length formula_4, its surface area and volume can be formulated as:
formula_5

== Cartesian coordinates ==
Let formula_6 be the smallest positive root of the polynomial
formula_7
Then, Cartesian coordinates of a sphenomegacorona with edge length 2 are given by the union of the orbits of the points
formula_8
under the action of the group generated by reflections about the xz-plane and the yz-plane.

<text>In geometry, the sphenocorona is a Johnson solid with 12 equilateral triangles and 2 squares as its faces.

== Properties ==
The sphenocorona was named by in which he used the prefix &quot;spheno-&quot; referring to a wedge-like complex formed by two adjacent &quot;lunes&quot;—a square with equilateral triangles attached on its opposite sides. The suffix &quot;-corona&quot; refers to a crownlike complex of 8 equilateral triangles. By joining both complexes together, the resulting polyhedron has 12 equilateral triangles and 2 squares, making 14 faces. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular polygons is called a Johnson solid. The sphenocorona is among them, enumerated as the 86th Johnson solid formula_1. It is an elementary polyhedron, meaning it cannot be separated by a plane into two small regular-faced polyhedra.

The surface area of a sphenocorona with edge length formula_2 can be calculated as:
formula_3
and its volume as:
formula_4

== Cartesian coordinates ==
Let formula_5 be the smallest positive root of the quartic polynomial formula_6. Then, Cartesian coordinates of a sphenocorona with edge length 2 are given by the union of the orbits of the points
formula_7
under the action of the group generated by reflections about the xz-plane and the yz-plane.

== Variations ==
The sphenocorona is also the vertex figure of the isogonal n-gonal double antiprismoid where n is an odd number greater than one, including the grand antiprism with pairs of trapezoid rather than square faces.

<text>The is a Japanese corporate group and &quot;keiretsu&quot; that traces its roots to the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; groups that were dissolved after World War II. Unlike the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; of the pre-war period, there is no controlling company with regulatory power. Instead, the companies in the group hold shares in each other, but they are limited to exchanging information and coordinating plans through regular meetings.

==History==
The Sumitomo Group traces its roots to a bookshop in Kyoto founded circa 1615 by Masatomo Sumitomo, a former Buddhist monk. Even today, management of the group is guided by his &quot;Founder&#x27;s Precepts&quot;, written in the 17th century.

Copper refining made the company famous. Riemon Soga, Masatomo Sumitomo&#x27;s brother-in-law, learned Western methods of copper refining. In 1590, he established a smelting business, &quot;Izumiya&quot;, literally meaning &quot;spring shop&quot;. Riemon perfected techniques that allowed the extraction of silver from copper ore, something Japanese technology had not previously accomplished.

The smelting and smithing business was moved from Kyoto to Osaka by the late 17th century. Soga passed control of the company to his son Tomomochi who managed its transformation into a major trading house during the Edo period. Sumitomo began to export copper, import silk, and provide financial services. By 1691, copper mining had been added to the portfolio.

The Meiji Restoration allowed Sumitomo to import and utilize Western machines and techniques in its mines. Sumitomo soon branched out into even more business areas entering the machine and coal industries, as well as the forestry, banking and warehousing businesses becoming a &quot;zaibatsu&quot;, or business conglomerate.

After World War II, the Japanese &quot;zaibatsu&quot; conglomerates, including Sumitomo, were dissolved by the GHQ and the Japanese government. The group reformed as a &quot;keiretsu&quot;, a group of independent companies organized around The Sumitomo Bank (now Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) and bound together by cross shareholding.

Many companies continue to use the word &quot;Sumitomo&quot; in their corporate names. Most of them are managed independently and listed at Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and other stock exchanges with highly dispersed shareholders. For some, the name only shows their historic origin, and they are no longer considered part of the Sumitomo Group.

In 1982, Sumitomo reported an energy conservation program.

===Emblem===
The diamond-shaped &quot;igeta&quot; mark is reminiscent of a type of frame placed over a well in premodern Japan and was the logo of Riemon Soga&#x27;s &quot;Izumiya&quot; company.

<text>Trawden is a village in the Trawden Forest parish of Pendle, at the foot of Boulsworth Hill, in Lancashire, England. The village co-operatively owns and runs its library, shop, community centre and pub. Samantha Bailey, a local resident, has claimed Trawden is the greatest village in the world and also believes Steeton is too far. Miss Bailey can regularly be heard chanting &#x27;Long live the Trawden Arms&#x27; out of her bedroom window at passers by.

In 2022, Trawden was named as the best place to live in the Northwest of England by The Sunday Times.

== Activities ==

As a way of encouraging people to visit Trawden and the surrounding area, a small group of village residents organise and mobilise other villagers in order to hold the annual Trawden Garden Festival and Scarecrow Trail. This takes place over the first weekend in July.

Trawden also holds an annual agricultural show on the 2nd Sunday in August, which many farmers, riders and people from around Lancashire enjoy and take part in.

Trawden F.C. were champions of the Pendle Charity League Second Division in the 2006–07 season.

Trawden Athletic Club is a running club consisting of around 400 members (as of January 2017) who compete in local and regional road, fell, trail and cross country races.

The Trawden Forest Community Centre is in the heart of the village. The Centre is run by a Committee of Trustees made up of volunteers from the local community. It is entirely self-funded, covering running costs through user fees supplemented by fundraising. Several local groups meet regularly at the centre and it is also used for many private and community events.

Trawden in Bloom is a voluntary organisation which is responsible for planting the baskets around the village, weeding and generally keeping the parish colourful and tidy. 
They include is a group of youngsters, called the Young Bloomers, who have their own raised beds for growing flowers and vegetables, besides planting tubs and weeding the pavements.

==Economy==

Agriculture was formerly the main industry of the village and surrounding area, although it did have several mills, most of which have now been demolished for, or converted to, housing.

Wycoller is a lived-in hamlet in the Trawden Forest; it is also an important tourist destination and country park. It is the most visited part of the Forest and there are two visitor centres, the aisled Barn adjoining Wycoller Hall and Pepper Hill Barn, both managed by Lancashire County Council.

The village co-operatively owns and runs its library, shop, community centre and pub, in a venture described in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2022 as &quot;a model for cooperative local living that offers inspiration and hope to declining settlements across the world&quot;. The village took over the library in 2017, obtaining grant funding to rebuild it with solar panels and ground-source heat pump. The village raised £450,000 in 2021 to buy the Victorian era pub. 120 volunteers do 2-hour shifts to operate the shop; it operates profitably with takings of £500,000 a year.

<doc id="1142789" wikidata="Q6604587" url="?curid=1142789" title="List of You Can't Do That on Television episodes">
<text>This is a list of episodes of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot;, a Canadian live-action variety sketch show that offers a subversive spin on specific topics as filtered through the lives of pre-teens and teenagers. The show was in production from 1979 to 1990. No episodes were produced in 1980 and 1988.

==Episode list==

===Season 1 (1979)===

These were hour-long episodes aired locally on Saturday mornings on CJOH-TV in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and were a mixture of prerecorded comedy sketches and mostly live link scenes, along with phone-in contests, music videos, disco dancing contests, and interviews. These early episodes also sported great prize giveaways like a portable television set, a Panasonic radio, and vinyl albums. Until March 2013, only three episodes from this season were known to exist in their entirety. In March 2013, information and photos from the &quot;missing&quot; episodes were provided to www.ycdtotv.com, and in June 2013, the episodes themselves were uploaded to YouTube. They have since been removed.

===Season 2 (1981 (Canada); 1982 (United States)===
This season originally had the same format as the 1979 episodes (except that the disco dancing segments were replaced with video game contests). However, beginning with this season, each episode had a specific theme along with a &quot;preempted show&quot; intro. In addition, half-hour versions were made for national and international syndication. The &quot;international&quot; versions of these episodes composed the first season of the series to air on Nickelodeon, although slightly different versions were made to be shown in Canada. Many scenes (including slime, water and pie scenes) were also reshot for the syndicated versions to remove local Ottawa or specifically Canadian references; the reshot scenes are often easy to spot because the kids often sported longer hair. This seasons&#x27; first seven episodes were released on iTunes on December 17, 2012. At the end of the Smoking episode, McGlade gave a special acknowledgement to Lye, who never smoked in real life, for doing so much smoking during the episode. He greatly appreciated the acknowledgement, and also said he&#x27;d never smoke again. (He would be forced to, however, in filming the 1989 &quot;Smoking&quot; episode.)

In addition to airing on Nickelodeon, the half-hour edits of this season&#x27;s episodes were also broadcast locally on CJOH starting in January 1982. To make up for the lack of local content, the show&#x27;s cast and crew made a new, local-only program, &quot;Something Else&quot;, to preserve the variety-show and local-interest segments that had been part of the original &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;. &quot;Something Else&quot; aired Saturday mornings on CJOH immediately following the &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; reruns. Christine also sported her natural hair (cut short and dyed with pink highlights), rather than the wigs she&#x27;d be forced to wear during the 1982 season of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;.

===Season 3 (1982)===
This is the first season in which each episode was made in the half-hour format and produced specifically for Nickelodeon. With many of the regulars from the 1981 season having grown too old for the show, this season saw the additions of several new cast members, including Alasdair Gillis, Vanessa Lindores, Elizabeth Richardson and Doug Ptolemy, and Abby Hagyard as the series&#x27; token adult female to play opposite Les Lye. Also, host Christine McGlade wore wigs throughout the season in order to hide her natural hair, which had been cut short and dyed with pink highlights. CTV would also give the show a second try on the network in the fall of 1982, airing once a week on Saturday mornings.

===Season 4 (1983-1984)===
1983 marked the last season for regulars Brodie Osome and Martin Kerr, but the show welcomed newcomer Justin Cammy. With video-game arcades rising in popularity, Blip&#x27;s Arkaid was added to the roster of skits this season. In late 1983, the original 28 minute episodes were cut by 3 minutes when Nickelodeon started allowing outside advertising. The first ten 1983 episodes were the last episodes to be shown in the 28 minute format.

===Season 5 (1984-1985)===
Because the show had become Nickelodeon&#x27;s highest-rated television series and provided extra funding to CJOH, the 1984 season saw double the number of episodes produced, with 26 instead of the usual 13 seen in the seasons prior. New regulars Stephanie Chow, Adam Kalbfleisch, Ben Schreiner, Pauline Kerr (sister of former cast member Martin Kerr) and Marjorie Silcoff, were introduced this season, while future regular Adam Reid appeared for the first time in a brief, non-speaking role, and Angie Coddett, Kevin Kubusheskie, Luke McKeehan, and Klea Scott gave their final performances. One of Les Lye&#x27;s most popular characters, the reckless school bus driver Snake Eyes, made his debut this season.

===Season 6 (1985)===
To prepare for the departure of long-time host Christine McGlade, Alasdair Gillis became a co-host alongside her. Adam Reid became a new regular cast member, while Lisa Ruddy began her last season on the show. This was also the final season with Blip&#x27;s Arkaid, as home video game systems had begun to eclipse video arcades in popularity.

===Season 7 (1986-1987)===
While still in its height popularity-wise, the 1986 season saw many changes for the show. Most notably, long-time host Christine McGlade and fan favorite Alasdair Gillis would both leave, and frequent director Geoffrey Darby would be replaced by Brenda Mason, who would go on to direct the remaining episodes of the show&#x27;s &quot;original run&quot;. The season also began to see the show&#x27;s dark comedy shift from black comedy more towards &quot;gross-out humour&quot;, featuring characters getting dumped on with pig manure (Vanessa), elephant dung (Alasdair &amp; Vanessa), vomit (James, Stephanie), and toilet water (Matthew) in addition to the regular stage pollution. Potty humour would become even more prevalent in later seasons however. To complete her contract obligations, Christine appeared only in the first five episodes of this season until she left after the fifth episode. Alasdair Gillis succeeded her as host until he too left towards the end of the season. Matthew Godfrey, Amyas Godfrey, Andrea Byrne, and Alanis Morissette all joined the regular cast.
===Season 8 (1987)===
By this time, all but four of the second generation cast had already ended their time on the show, and it was supposed to be the final season. Only five episodes were filmed and aired, one of which (&quot;Adoption&quot;) was banned for making light of child abuse (in Canada, the &quot;Adoption&quot; episode was edited to remove the &quot;damn&quot; in Senator Prevert&#x27;s line &quot;You get over here right away, ya damn bureaucrat!&quot;, but the episode was eventually pulled because the producers felt the episode&#x27;s jokes about adoption were in bad taste). This makes this season the shortest season of the show, tied with the season in 1990. Despite the short production order, the show was as popular as ever on Nickelodeon, and re-runs were still broadcast as part of the network&#x27;s daily programming. Vanessa continued to handle most of the hosting duties, while Adam continued working as both a cast member and a writer on the show. Tone-wise, the show continued its trend towards being more slime-gag and potty humour oriented, with all of the episodes featuring additional stage pollution to the regular slime, water, and pies, and several of the episode topics being chosen specifically for their ability to cater towards toilet humour. An hour-long special was also prepared for home video, but not released. It was known as &quot;The Worst of You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; and included new footage with Adam Reid, Vanessa Lindores, and Doug Plotemy as hosts, as well as footage from 1979–1987.

===Season 9 (1989-1990)===
After a hiatus, filming on what would become the 1989 season of the show commenced in the fall of 1988 with an almost entirely new cast of kids. Only Amyas Godfrey and Andrea Byrne returned from the 1987 season (and the latter for only one episode), although two other members of the 1986 cast (Rekha Shah and James Tung) returned for one or two episodes and Sidharth Sahay replaced his brother, 1986-87 cast member Vikram. In addition, Vanessa Lindores also returned to guest-host the &quot;Age&quot; episode (which also featured cameos by several other former cast members). Chris Bickford was made as the official host, although some other kids, including Jill and Amy Stanley, Christian Tessier, and Rekha Shah, also took turns at hosting. Adam Reid and Kevin Kubusheskie became a writer and a producer, respectively, and had occasional cameos. The first episodes of this season premiered concurrently with a tie-in promotion for the 1989 edition of Nickelodeon&#x27;s Slime-In Sweepstakes (including a commercial introducing some of the &quot;new kids&quot; in which Nick Belcourt, Christian Tessier, Chris Bickford and Amyas Godfrey were all slimed). This season was almost filmed at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, but at the last minute the decision was made to stay at CJOH, although a replica of the link set had been recreated in Florida. &quot;The Worst of You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; was remade (albeit shortened to a half hour) with Chris Bickford, Jennifer Brackenbury, and Christian Tessier as hosts, and released on video in time for the 1989 holiday season. Les Lye&#x27;s &quot;doctor&quot; character was also changed to a dentist this season.

===Season 10 (1990)===
After 11 years in production, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; is cancelled. Only five episodes were produced, with production ending in February. Nickelodeon&#x27;s final Slime-In was also held this season, with the winner being slimed at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando and not in Ottawa, as the series had already been canceled by then.

<doc id="1142794" wikidata="Q174614" url="?curid=1142794" title="Carlo Ancelotti">
<text>Carlo Ancelotti (; born 10 June 1959) is an Italian professional football manager and former player who is the manager of Real Madrid. Nicknamed &quot;Carletto&quot; in Italy and &quot;Don Carlo&quot; in Spain, he is regarded as one of the greatest football managers of all time. Ancelotti is the most successful manager in UEFA Champions League history, having won the trophy a record five times, and two more as a player. He is also the only manager to take part in six Champions League finals. As a player, he won two European Cups with AC Milan in 1989 and 1990, making him one of seven people to have won the European Cup/Champions League as both a player and a manager. Ancelotti is also the only manager to win league titles in all of Europe&#x27;s top five leagues. He has won the FIFA Club World Cup three times and has won the UEFA Super Cup five times, a record for a manager.

Ancelotti played as a midfielder and began his career with Italian club Parma, helping the club get promoted to Serie B in the 1978–79 season. He moved to Roma the following season, where he won a Serie A title and four Coppa Italia titles. He then played for the late 1980s Milan team and won many titles, including two &quot;Scudetti&quot; and two European Cups. At international level, he had 26 appearances and one goal for the Italy national team. He represented Italy at two FIFA World Cups and at the UEFA Euro 1988, finishing in third place at the 1990 World Cup and being a semi-finalist at the Euro tournament.

As a manager, Ancelotti worked for Reggiana, Parma, and Juventus between 1995 and 2001. He then joined Milan in 2001 and went on to win both the 2002–03 Champions League and 2002–03 Coppa Italia. The following season, he won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; with an Italian record of 82 points. In 2007, he won his second Champions League with Milan. Ancelotti was awarded the Serie A Coach of the Year twice. He resigned from Milan after the 2008–09 season and was the club’s longest-serving manager.

In 2009, Ancelotti became the manager of Chelsea and won the domestic double of the Premier League and the FA Cup in his first season. In 2011, he became the manager of Paris Saint-Germain; the following season, he won them their first Ligue 1 title in 19 years and was awarded joint Ligue 1 Manager of the Year. Following his success in France, Ancelotti became the manager of Real Madrid. In his first season, he led Real Madrid to their tenth Champions League title and a Copa del Rey title. Despite winning more trophies with the club and being awarded the Miguel Muñoz Trophy in 2014–15 for the best manager in La Liga, Ancelotti was dismissed from Real Madrid in May 2015. He became the manager of Bayern Munich in 2016 and won the Bundesliga title in his first season. Following stints at Napoli and Everton between 2018 and 2021, he returned to Real Madrid in the summer of 2021, where he won two La Liga–Champions League doubles in 2022 and 2024.

== Club career ==
=== Parma ===
Ancelotti began his career in 1974 with Parma. He made his professional debut in Serie C during the 1976–77 season, at the age of 18. Under manager Cesare Maldini, he was often deployed as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker, due to his eye for goal. Ancelotti excelled in these roles and helped Parma to a second place in the Serie C1 girone A during the 1978–79 season, which qualified the team for the Serie B play-offs. In the decisive match in Vicenza, against Triestina, with the score tied at 1–1, he scored two goals, which gave Parma a 3–1 victory and sealed their place in Serie B the following season.

=== Roma ===
After attracting strong interest from Inter Milan, in mid-1979 Ancelotti transferred to Roma, and made his Serie A debut in a 0–0 draw against AC Milan on 16 September. Under manager Nils Liedholm, he was deployed as a winger or central midfielder and became one of the club&#x27;s most important players, in a team which featured Brazilian midfielders Falcão and Toninho Cerezo, as well as Italian footballers Roberto Pruzzo, Bruno Conti, Agostino Di Bartolomei and Pietro Vierchowod, winning consecutive Coppa Italia titles in his first two seasons with the club. During his eight seasons in Rome, he won the Coppa Italia a total of four times (1980, 1981, 1984 and 1986). After struggling with knee injuries, and managing second and third-place league finishes in 1981 and 1982, Ancelotti helped lead the team to win the Italian championship in 1983, the club&#x27;s second league title in their history.

In the following season, Ancelotti helped Roma to win another Coppa Italia title and reach the European Cup final in 1984, although he missed the final through injury, as Roma were defeated by Liverpool on penalties at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. He was named the team&#x27;s captain in 1985 under new club manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, and served as a mentor to the young midfielder Giuseppe Giannini, as Roma won the Coppa Italia, but once again narrowly missed out on the league title during the 1985–86 Serie A season, finishing in second place behind Juventus.

=== AC Milan ===
From 1987 until 1992, Ancelotti played for Milan, and was a key part of the squad that won the Serie A title in 1988, consecutive European Cups in 1989 and 1990, two European Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and a Supercoppa Italiana under manager Arrigo Sacchi. During this time, Milan, under the financial backing of club president Silvio Berlusconi, featured players such as Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Mauro Tassotti and Alessandro Costacurta as defenders; Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Roberto Donadoni as midfielders; and Marco van Basten upfront. One of Ancelotti&#x27;s most memorable moments with Milan was when he received a pass from Ruud Gullit, dribbled around two Real Madrid players and netted a powerful long-range shot during the &quot;Rossoneri&#x27;s&quot; 5–0 thrashing of Real Madrid in the 1989 European Cup semi-finals. He went on to play all 90 minutes in Milan&#x27;s 4–0 win over Steaua București in the final.

The following season, Ancelotti suffered an injury to his left knee in the quarter-finals of the European Cup against KV Mechelen, which forced him to miss the semi-finals, although he was able to return in time to help Milan defend their title against Benfica in the final, held in Vienna. Following Sacchi&#x27;s departure, he won a second Serie A title under his replacement Fabio Capello during the 1991–92 Serie A season, as Milan won the title undefeated, but persistent knee injuries and competition from youngster Demetrio Albertini limited his playing time, and eventually forced him into premature retirement at the end of the season, at the age of 33. He played the final match of his career with the club in a 4–0 home win over Hellas Verona on 17 May 1992, in which he came off the bench in the final 20 minutes of the game and scored two goals, and was given an ovation by the fans.

== International career ==
Under manager Enzo Bearzot, Ancelotti made his Italy national team debut and scored his first and only goal on 6 January 1981 in the 1980 World Champions&#x27; Gold Cup against the Netherlands, which ended in a 1–1 draw. He was very likely to be capped for the 1982 World Cup campaign, but a dramatic knee injury forced him away for several months, as Italy went on to win the tournament without him. He was a part of Italy&#x27;s World Cup squad in the 1986 World Cup, where he did not make a single appearance, however, as both he and Paolo Rossi struggled during the team&#x27;s fitness tests, due to the altitude of the region, and were replaced in the starting line-up by Fernando De Napoli and Giuseppe Galderisi, respectively.

Under new Italy manager Azeglio Vicini, he was also a key member of the Italy squad that reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1988, and was also set to represent his nation at the Summer Olympics in Seoul that summer. An injury to the meniscus of his right knee, however, prevented him from taking part in the tournament, where Italy ultimately managed a fourth-place finish. Ancelotti later went on to play in the 1990 World Cup on home soil under Vicini at the age of 31, although an injury in the first group match against Austria once again limited his appearances in the competition to just three, and kept him on the sidelines until the third-place final against England, in which he returned to help Italy to a 2–1 win. Ancelotti made a total of 26 performances for the Italy national side, and announced his retirement from international football in 1991, making his final Italy appearance under Arrigo Sacchi.

== Style of play ==
Ancelotti was a midfielder known for his leadership and creativity; he was regarded as one of the best Italian midfielders of his generation. Although he lacked pace and physicality, he was a talented, hardworking, and tenacious player who had excellent technical ability, tactical intelligence, vision, and passing range; his most notable skill being his powerful and accurate shooting from outside the box. A versatile midfielder, he was capable playing several midfield positions. He often played as a deep-lying playmaker, as a central midfielder, or as a defensive midfielder, which allowed him to set the tempo of play after winning back the ball; he was also the mentor and predecessor of Demetrio Albertini and Andrea Pirlo when he was a playmaker at Milan. Despite his abilities, his playing time was cut short by several injuries, which forced him into retirement in 1992 at the age of 33.

== Managerial career ==
=== Reggiana ===
Ancelotti undertook his coaching studies at Coverciano, where he penned a research article entitled &quot;Il Futuro del Calcio: Più Dinamicità&quot; (English: &quot;The Future of Football: More Dynamism&quot;). After serving as an assistant manager with the Italy national team under his former Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi between 1992 and 1995, and reaching the 1994 World Cup final, Ancelotti began his managerial career with Serie B side Reggiana in 1995–96 season, where he immediately aided the team in achieving promotion to Serie A; he left after the 1995–96 Serie B season, finishing with a record of 17 wins, fourteen draws and ten losses in his only season with the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC Reggiana » Fixtures &amp; Results 1995/1996&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parma ===
Ancelotti joined Parma the following season, a team which had recently enjoyed several years of domestic and European success under the previous manager Nevio Scala, and which contained several promising young players, including future Italy stars Gianluigi Buffon and Fabio Cannavaro. Ancelotti made his debut in the Coppa Italia in a 3–1 loss to Pescara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parma Calcio 1913 » Fixtures &amp; Results 1996/1997&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ancelotti made several changes at the club, implementing a rigorous Sacchi-inspired 4–4–2 formation, and initially deploying creative forward Gianfranco Zola out of position on the left wing in order to accommodate Hristo Stoichkov up-front, although both players were later eventually sold by the club after lack of playing time, due to struggling to perform in this system. With the new attacking partnership of Enrico Chiesa and Hernán Crespo, Parma finished second in Serie A during the 1996–97 season under Ancelotti, which guaranteed them a place in the next edition of the UEFA Champions League.

The following season, the club had agreed to sign another Italian creative forward, Roberto Baggio, but Ancelotti impeded the transfer as he once again did not feel that a player like Baggio would fit into his tactical plans. Ancelotti later stated that he regretted this decision, stating that at the time he believed that the 4–4–2 was the ideal formation for success, and that offensive playmakers were not compatible with this system. After suffering a first round elimination in the 1997–98 Champions League, and a semi–final appearance in the Coppa Italia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Parma Calcio 1913 » Fixtures &amp; Results 1997/1998&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ancelotti was only able to guide Parma to a sixth-place finish in Serie A during the 1997–98 season, and was dismissed at the end of the season, despite qualifying the team for next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup.

=== Juventus ===
In February 1999, Ancelotti was appointed manager of Juventus, where he both succeeded and preceded Marcello Lippi, who returned to the club when Ancelotti left. With Juventus, Ancelotti became less rigorous with the team&#x27;s formation, abandoning his favoured 4–4–2 in order to accommodate French playmaker Zinedine Zidane in his preferred free role behind the forwards in the team&#x27;s starting line-up. Juventus reached the semi-finals of the Champions League during the 1998–99 season, losing out to eventual champions Manchester United, but finished in seventh place in Serie A, failing to qualify for the Champions League the following season and also losing out to Udinese on aggregate in the UEFA Cup play-offs, meaning they qualified for the Intertoto Cup.

Ancelotti&#x27;s first full season at Juventus began promisingly, as he immediately won the Intertoto Cup with the club by beating Rennes 4–2 on aggregate, although Juventus suffered a round of 16 elimination in the UEFA Cup, and lost the league title to Lazio by a single point on the final match-day of the season; this was after surrendering a five-point lead with three games remaining, which drew strong criticism from the board of directors.

The following season, Ancelotti went trophyless, suffering a first-round elimination in the Champions League, and finishing runner-up in Serie A yet again, to Roma, and he was dismissed by Juventus. Ancelotti&#x27;s dismissal was announced by Juventus at half-time in the final league game of the season at home against Atalanta, on 17 June 2001, even though they were still within a chance of winning the title; Juventus won the match 2–1, although the result was not enough to prevent them from finishing behind Roma in the league. Ancelotti finished his tenure with Juventus with a record of 63 wins, 33 draws and 18 losses.

=== AC Milan ===
Ancelotti was appointed Milan manager on 5 November 2001, after Fatih Terim was dismissed due to poor results. He was inheriting another recently trophyless team in Milan, as the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; had floundered domestically and in Europe since their last &quot;Scudetto&quot; victory in 1999. In the 2001–02 season, Ancelotti led Milan to qualify for the Champions League once again, as the team managed a fourth-place finish in Serie A, and also reached semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, their best ever finish in the competition, losing out to Borussia Dortmund, and also suffered a semi-final elimination in the Coppa Italia to Juventus.

The following season, Ancelotti – who was heavily criticised by club owner Silvio Berlusconi due to his supposedly defensive tactics – was able to adopt a creative play in Milan while making several changes to the team&#x27;s squad. He made Dida, still maligned for his 2000–01 Champions League howler against Leeds United, his new starting goalkeeper barely a month into the season, while converting budding attacking midfielder Andrea Pirlo to a defensive midfielder, playing him behind the number 10 (either Rui Costa or Rivaldo) in front of the team&#x27;s back-line as a deep-lying playmaker in a 4–3–1–2 or 4–1–2–1–2 formation. At the same time, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko proved to be dominant and dynamic strikers, who were prolific in front of goal.

Milan won the 2003 Champions League final, beating Juventus 3–2 on penalties at Old Trafford, and also won the 2003 Coppa Italia Final over Roma. The following season, with the addition of Brazilian attacking midfielder Kaká, and Ancelotti&#x27;s formidable four-man back-line of Cafu, Costacurta, Alessandro Nesta and Maldini, Milan took home the UEFA Super Cup in 2003 over Porto, followed by the &quot;Scudetto&quot; in 2004 with an Italian record of 82 points from 34 games, while Shevchenko finished the season as the league&#x27;s top-scorer. The &quot;Rossoneri&quot;, however, suffered penalty-shootout defeats to Juventus in the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana, and to Boca Juniors in the 2003 Intercontinental Cup. They were also knocked out by Deportivo de La Coruña in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League.

Under Ancelotti&#x27;s reign, Milan won the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana, and were also back-to-back Serie A runners-up to Juventus in 2004–05 and 2005–06 (both &quot;scudetti&quot; were later wiped from the record books of Juventus due to the club&#x27;s involvement in the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal). During the 2004–05 season, Ancelotti also led Milan to the 2005 Champions League final, where they lost out to Liverpool 2–3 on penalties after a 3–3 draw in normal time. In the Coppa Italia, the team was unable to get past the quarter finals. The following season, Milan once again faced disappointment as they lost out to Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals, and only reached the quarterfinals of the Coppa Italia.

After the departure of striker Andriy Shevchenko at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Ancelotti was forced to redesign Milan&#x27;s line-up once again, devising a 4–3–2–1 system that would later be known as his &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; formation. Milan&#x27;s line-up used Inzaghi as a lone striker, supported by attacking midfielders Clarence Seedorf and Kaká, in front of a three-man midfield which featured Andrea Pirlo as a creative playmaker, supported by hard-working defensive midfielders Gennaro Gattuso and Massimo Ambrosini.

Milan received an eight-point deduction during the 2006–07 Serie A season for their role in the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal, which virtually put the team out of the title race, and instead led Ancelotti to focus on winning the Champions League. On 23 May 2007, Milan avenged their defeat to Liverpool two years earlier with a 2–1 win at the Olympic Stadium in Athens in the 2007 Champions League final, leading to Ancelotti&#x27;s second Champions League trophy as Milan coach and his fourth title overall, having also won it twice as a Milan player in 1989 and 1990. During the 2006–07 season, Milan also finished fourth in Serie A, and lost out to eventual champions Roma in the Coppa Italia semi-final. The next season, Ancelotti also won the 2007 UEFA Super Cup, as well as the club&#x27;s first ever FIFA Club World Cup in 2007, becoming the first manager to do so with a European side. After finishing the league in fifth place, Milan missed out on Champions League qualification, and also suffered round of 16 eliminations in the Champions League and Coppa Italia (to Arsenal and Catania respectively).

In Ancelotti&#x27;s final season at the club, Milan managed a third-place finish in Serie A behind Juventus and cross-city rivals Inter, sealing a place in the next season&#x27;s Champions League, while they were eliminated in the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup, and the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia. After previously denying rumours that he would be leaving the club, on 31 May 2009 Ancelotti announced his resignation from Milan – less than an hour after their 2–0 victory over Fiorentina in the final match of the season. In total, Ancelotti led Milan for 423 games; only Nereo Rocco has been in charge of the club for more matches.

=== Chelsea ===
On 1 June 2009, Ancelotti succeeded interim manager Guus Hiddink when he was confirmed as the new Chelsea manager after agreeing to a three-year contract, and formally assumed his duties on 1 July. Ancelotti became the club&#x27;s fourth permanent manager in 21 months, following José Mourinho, Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari. He was also the third Italian to manage Chelsea, after Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri.

On 9 August 2009, Ancelotti won his first trophy as Chelsea manager, the Community Shield, beating Manchester United on penalties, following a 2–2 draw. His first Premier League game in charge of the Blues ended in a 2–1 home victory over Hull City on 15 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chelsea FC » Fixtures &amp; Results 2009/2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea lost their first match under Ancelotti at the DW Stadium away to Wigan Athletic on 26 September, losing 1–3. They were eliminated from the League Cup on 2 December, reaching the quarter-finals stage, after a penalty shootout defeat to Blackburn Rovers after a 3–3 draw at Ewood Park.

In the Champions League, Ancelotti returned to the San Siro for the first time since his departure from Milan, when his team faced Inter Milan, who was at the time coached by ex-Chelsea manager José Mourinho, at the Round of 16 stage. Ancelotti and Mourinho had a tense relationship from the previous season, as managers of Milan and Inter respectively. Chelsea was eliminated from the Champions League on 16 March 2010 after a 1–3 aggregate loss to Inter, having lost 1–2 away and 0–1 at Stamford Bridge.

On 9 May 2010, Ancelotti led Chelsea to the Premier League title, beating Manchester United by one point and setting scoring records. The team finished the campaign with 103 goals, becoming the first team in the Premier League to score more than 100 goals in a season, and the first in the English top flight since Tottenham Hotspur in the 1962–63 season. Chelsea secured the title with an 8–0 victory over Wigan at Stamford Bridge. Ancelotti also became the first Italian manager to win the Premier League and only the fifth manager overall in the League&#x27;s 18 seasons. On 15 May 2010, Ancelotti led Chelsea to its first ever domestic double by defeating Portsmouth 1–0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley; this was Chelsea&#x27;s third FA Cup in four years, equalling the record set by Arsenal between 2002 and 2005.

The following season, after having lost to Manchester United in the 2010 FA Community Shield in August, Ancelotti led Chelsea to the top of the table on the first weekend of the season thanks to a 6–0 rout of newly promoted West Bromwich Albion. Chelsea followed up this result with another 6–0 win, this time over Wigan, while Stoke City were beaten 2–0 in the next match. Chelsea had a good start to the season, winning their first five matches. Chelsea then lost 3–4 against Newcastle United on 23 September 2010 in the League Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chelsea FC » Fixtures &amp; Results 2010/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They then went on to lose against Manchester City in the Premier League 0–1 after a cleverly-taken strike by City captain Carlos Tevez. Chelsea made a good start in Europe by beating MŠK Žilina and Marseille 4–1 and 2–0, respectively, in the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. Chelsea then defeated fourth-placed Arsenal 2–0 on 3 October 2010, courtesy of a goal from Didier Drogba and a free-kick by defender Alex.

Chelsea&#x27;s next defeat of the season came against Liverpool at Anfield on 7 November 2010, where they lost 0–2 with both goals coming from Fernando Torres. A week later, Chelsea suffered their second Premier League defeat in three matches with a remarkable 0–3 home defeat to Sunderland. In their following five league games, they lost two and drew three games, culminating in a 1–3 loss to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. On 5 January 2011, Chelsea suffered a shock 0–1 defeat at struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers, leaving them fifth in the league and in real danger of missing out on a Champions League place for the first time since 2002. This result led to Ancelotti ruling out Chelsea&#x27;s chances of retaining the title, insisting that he did not fear that he would be dismissed. After this match, however, Chelsea&#x27;s form began to improve. First with a 7–0 thrashing of Ipswich Town in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge, and then a 2–0 victory over Blackburn, followed by emphatic away wins against Bolton Wanderers and Sunderland, putting them in fourth position in the league, though still ten points behind leaders Manchester United.

On 31 January 2011, Chelsea signed Liverpool striker Fernando Torres for a then-British record fee of £50 million, and Benfica defender David Luiz for £22 million. Chelsea lost 0–1 to Liverpool at Stamford Bridge but beat league leaders Manchester United on 1 March in a 2–1 comeback win that saw David Luiz net his first goal for Chelsea, which was followed by a 3–1 win away to Blackpool. Chelsea were later defeated by Manchester United at home and away (aggregate of 1–3) in the Champions League quarter-finals.

Following their defeat in the Champions League, Chelsea made a remarkable comeback in the league, defeating Wigan 1–0 at home, West Brom 3–1 away, Birmingham City 3–1, West Ham United 3–0 and Tottenham 2–1 at home. Chelsea, who at one point were fifth and 15 points behind leaders Manchester United, vaulted into the second position the league, just three points behind them with three games left of the season. On 8 May, Chelsea lost 1–2 against Manchester United at Old Trafford to stay second in the league, now six points behind the leaders with just two more games to play.

Ancelotti was dismissed less than two hours after a 0–1 away defeat against Everton on 22 May 2011, Chelsea&#x27;s last Premier League match of the season. They had finished the 2010–11 Premier League in second place. He reportedly received a severance payment of £6 million from Chelsea. Ancelotti finished with a record of 67 wins, 20 draws and 22 losses in 109 matches. Ancelotti&#x27;s win percentage at Chelsea was (as of May 2016) the third-highest in Premier League history, behind only José Mourinho and Alex Ferguson.

=== Paris Saint-Germain ===
On 30 December 2011, with Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the Ligue 1 with three points down to Montpellier, Ancelotti was appointed as the new manager of the club on the same day as their previous manager, Antoine Kombouaré, was released from his contract. On 21 March 2012, Ancelotti experienced his first defeat in charge of PSG as the club fell to a 1–3 defeat at the hands of Lyon in a Coupe de France quarter-final match. Ten days later, PSG suffered their first Ligue 1 defeat under Ancelotti when they lost 1–2 away to Nancy. PSG ended up as runners-up in Ligue 1 in Ancelotti&#x27;s first season in charge, three points behind winners Montpellier. He also took PSG to the Coupe de France quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paris Saint-Germain » Fixtures &amp; Results 2011/2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The club were eliminated from the Coupe de la Ligue and UEFA Europa League prior to Ancelotti&#x27;s appointment.

During Ancelotti&#x27;s first full season at the club, PSG entered the winter break at the top of the Ligue 1 table, ahead of Lyon and Marseille on goal difference. They clinched the Ligue 1 title on 12 May 2013, with two matches to spare. The club reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they lost to Barcelona on the away goals rule (3–3 on aggregate), the quarter-finals of the Coupe de France and the quarter-finals of the Coupe de la Ligue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paris Saint-Germain » Fixtures &amp; Results 2012/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 2013, Ancelotti asked to leave the club, in order to join Real Madrid.

=== Real Madrid ===
On 25 June 2013, Ancelotti became the manager of Real Madrid, replacing the departing José Mourinho, and signing a three-year contract. He was introduced at a press conference at the Santiago Bernabéu, where it was also announced that Zinedine Zidane and Paul Clement would be his assistant coaches. Shortly following his arrival, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Isco for a fee of €24 million, which was followed by the signing of Asier Illarramendi for €32 million. Argentinean striker Gonzalo Higuaín left the club for €40 million to Napoli. This, along with the sale of Mesut Özil to Arsenal, paved the way for Gareth Bale&#x27;s signing from Tottenham Hotspur for then-world record fee of £86 million (€105M). In Ancelotti&#x27;s first league game in charge, on 18 August 2013, Real Madrid started the season by winning 2–1 at home against Real Betis. Ancelotti eventually deviated from the 4–2–3–1 formation that had been deployed by his predecessor José Mourinho, switching instead to a 4–3–3 formation to great effect, in which Argentine winger Ángel Di María particularly excelled as a left-sided central midfielder, and played a key role in the club&#x27;s successes.

On 16 April 2014, Ancelotti won his first major trophy as Real Madrid manager after they defeated Barcelona 2–1 in the Copa del Rey final held at the Mestalla Stadium. On 29 April, Real Madrid defeated Bayern Munich in the semi-finals of the Champions League by an aggregate score of 5–0 (1–0 in Madrid and 0–4 in Munich), with &quot;Los Blancos&quot; reaching their first final since they last won the competition in 2002. Madrid finished third in the La Liga, accumulating 87 points in total (level with Barcelona, losing out on the second place on a tie-breaker, and three behind champions Atlético Madrid). On 24 May, Real Madrid won their tenth Champions League trophy, after defeating recently crowned rivals Atlético Madrid in the final 4–1 after extra time. Ancelotti became only the second manager after Liverpool&#x27;s Bob Paisley to win the competition on three occasions, and the first man to win the Champions League/European Cup twice as a player and three times as a manager to this day.

On 12 August, Ancelotti started the new season by winning another European trophy, leading Real Madrid to a 2–0 victory over Sevilla in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup. In the last four months of 2014, his team set a Spanish record of 22 consecutive victories in all competitions that began on 16 September and culminated with Real Madrid&#x27;s first FIFA Club World Cup title in December 2014, finishing the year with four trophies. On 1 December 2014, Ancelotti was nominated as one of the three finalists for the 2014 FIFA World Coach of the Year Award. On 19 January 2015, Ancelotti was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame and on 20 January 2015, he won the IFFHS 2014 Award as The World&#x27;s Best Club Coach. Real Madrid finished the 2014–15 season in second place with 92 points, two off treble-winning Barcelona, and scoring a record 118 goals in the process. They were eliminated in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey by Atlético Madrid, whom they faced eight times throughout the season (including the UCL quarter-finals), and lost 3–2 on aggregate to Juventus in the Champions League semi-finals. On 25 May 2015, Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez announced that the club&#x27;s board had taken &quot;a very difficult decision&quot; to relieve Ancelotti of his duties with immediate effect. Pérez stated that Ancelotti had won the hearts of both the board and fans, and would always have a place in the club&#x27;s history because he was the coach that led them to the &quot;Décima&quot;. &quot;However at this club the demands are huge and we need a new impulse in order to win trophies and be at our best,&quot; he added.

After leaving Madrid, Ancelotti held talks about a return to Milan, which he rejected, saying: &quot;It was hard to say no to such a beloved club to me, but I need some rest. I wish them the best&quot;. He stated that he wanted to take a year off and undergo an operation for his spinal stenosis. He later relocated to Vancouver, Canada.

=== Bayern Munich ===
On 20 December 2015, Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed that Ancelotti would replace Pep Guardiola as manager for the 2016–17 season, signing a three-year contract. His contract started on 1 July 2016. His first training session was on 11 July 2016, and his first match was a pre–season win against SV Lippstadt. His first match at Allianz Arena was a 1–0 pre–season win over his predecessor Guardiola&#x27;s Manchester City. Bayern participated in the International Champions Cup. In the first match, Bayern lost to Milan in a shootout. In the second match, Bayern defeated Inter Milan. In the final match, Bayern lost to Real Madrid.

On 14 August 2016, Bayern defeated Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayern München » Fixtures &amp; Results 2016/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first trophy as Bayern&#x27;s manager. On 26 August 2016, in his Bundesliga debut, Bayern defeated Werder Bremen 6–0. In addition to defeating Borussia Dortmund, Carl Zeiss Jena and Werder Bremen, they defeated Schalke 04, Rostov, Ingolstadt 04, Hertha BSC and Hamburger SV to win his first eight matches as head coach, before losing to Atlético Madrid. They continued their winless streak against FC Köln and Eintracht Frankfurt, before beating PSV. After the win against Eindhoven, Bayern went on a three match winless streak. Bayern drew against 1899 Hoffenheim and lost against Borussia Dortmund and Rostov, before defeating Bayer Leverkusen. On 29 April, Ancelotti led Bayern to their fifth consecutive Bundesliga title and their 27th overall, following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. However, Bayern were eliminated in the Champions League in a quarter-final clash against Ancelotti&#x27;s former team Real Madrid. They also lost 3–2 to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal semi-finals.

On 5 August 2017, Ancelotti started the 2017–18 season with Bayern Munich by retaining the DFL-Supercup, beating out Borussia Dortmund 5–4 on penalties, following a 2–2 draw after 90 minutes; this was the sixth time that Bayern had managed to win the title. However, on 28 September 2017, Ancelotti was dismissed as manager of Bayern Munich, following a 3–0 away loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the club&#x27;s second group match of the 2017–18 Champions League the night before. After the Paris Saint-Germain match, reports surfaced that Ancelotti had lost the dressing room. It was reported that five senior players wanted Ancelotti out as manager, which Bayern&#x27;s president Uli Hoeneß later confirmed. Questions were also raised about Ancelotti&#x27;s tactical setup and team selection against Paris Saint-Germain, when he left several key players on the bench, and one was left to watch the match from the stands.

=== Napoli ===
On 23 May 2018, Ancelotti was appointed as head coach of Napoli, signing a three-year contract, replacing Maurizio Sarri in the role. On 19 August, he made his return to the Serie A, winning his first match as manager with a 2–1 away victory over Lazio. Napoli suffered a first round elimination in the Champions League, the first time since 2000 that Ancelotti failed to advance from this stage of the competition. Napoli eventually finished the 2018–19 Serie A season in second place, twelve points behind champions Juventus, and reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League, losing out to Arsenal.

On 10 December 2019, Ancelotti was dismissed, despite a 4–0 home win against Genk in their final 2019–20 UEFA Champions League match of the group stage that ensured Napoli&#x27;s advancement to the round of 16; the club were in joint–seventh place in Serie A, alongside Parma, at the time, and had not won a league game in seven matches. The decision came after a summit with Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis that had followed the match that was originally scheduled for 11 December.

=== Everton ===
On 21 December 2019, Ancelotti was appointed as manager of Everton on a four-and-a-half-year contract. His first match in charge was a 1–0 home victory over Burnley on 26 December. On 1 March 2020, Ancelotti was sent off after the full-time whistle, following an on-pitch conversation with the referee Chris Kavanagh, who had ruled out a would-be late match-winning goal against Manchester United, due to an offside that was determined by VAR. He was charged with misconduct by the FA the following day. Ancelotti went on to record a total of eight wins, five draws and six losses in the league in his first season with the Blues, as Everton finished in 12th place.

During the close-season, Ancelotti signed his former players James Rodríguez and Allan, along with Ben Godfrey, Abdoulaye Doucouré, Niels Nkounkou and loanee Robin Olsen. Everton started the 2020–21 season with seven consecutive wins in all competitions, and Ancelotti was named September&#x27;s Premier League Manager of the Month. After a drop in form, a resumption of good results saw Everton end 2020 in fourth place, but knocked out of the EFL Cup, losing 2–0 to Manchester United in the quarter-final. Results for the remainder of the season were mixed, and Everton finished the season in 10th place.

=== Return to Real Madrid ===

On 1 June 2021, Ancelotti resigned from his position at Everton to rejoin Real Madrid, following Zidane&#x27;s resignation, signing a contract until 2024. On 19 September 2021, Ancelotti reached the milestone of 800 league matches with clubs from the top five European leagues. On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of a possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España. Thus, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid, in addition to becoming the first manager to win all of Europe&#x27;s top five leagues. Real Madrid&#x27;s 5–4 aggregate win over defending champions Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-finals saw him become the first manager to reach the Champions League semi-finals in four different decades (the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s). In the Champions League final against Liverpool, Ancelotti&#x27;s record fifth in the competition, a lone Vinícius goal sealed the 14th European Cup for &quot;Los Blancos&quot;, and Ancelotti&#x27;s second in charge. Real also claimed their fourth ever European double. With this win, Ancelotti became the first manager in history to win four Champions League titles. Ancelotti placed second in the 2022 Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Coach award, behind winner Lionel Scaloni.

At the start of the 2022–23 season, Ancelotti guided his club to a UEFA Super Cup victory, his eighth trophy at Madrid. On 2 November 2022, he broke Ferguson&#x27;s record for most victories in the Champions League, after a 5–1 win over Celtic in the first round, which was his 103rd victory in the competition; the result also allowed Real Madrid to top their group and advance to the round of 16. On 11 February 2023, Ancelotti guided them to a fifth FIFA Club World Cup trophy, as Real Madrid beat Al Hilal 5–3 in the final. Real Madrid finished the season second to Barcelona in La Liga, and were also defeated by eventual champions Manchester City in the Champions League semi-finals 5–1 on aggregate, but beat Osasuna 2–1 to win the 2022–23 Copa del Rey. In the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals, a 4–0 away defeat against Manchester City on 7 May, Ancelotti overtook Ferguson as the manager with the most appearances as a manager in the Champions League (191).

Managing to win all three opening matches of Madrid&#x27;s 2023–24 league campaign, he was named La Liga&#x27;s Coach of the Month in August. With his team&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Real Sociedad on 17 September 2023, Ancelotti got his 173rd Madrid win, overtaking Zinedine Zidane to become the coach with the second most wins in the club&#x27;s history. On 29 December, although he had previously been linked with the position of head coach for the Brazil national football team, Real Madrid announced that Ancelotti had agreed to a contract extension until 30 June 2026.

In the first leg of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals – a 3–3 home draw against defending champions Manchester City on 9 April 2024, Ancelotti became the first manager to make 200 appearances in the competition. In the second leg on 17 April, Real Madrid overcame Manchester City 4–3 on penalties to advance to the semi-finals of the competition, following a 4–4 draw on aggregate; the result meant that Ancelotti equalled Pep Guardiola&#x27;s record of reaching the Champions League semi-finals on ten different occasions as a manager. Following rivals Barcelona&#x27;s 4–2 defeat to Girona on 4 May, Ancelotti&#x27;s Real Madrid clinched the league title mathematically; Real Madrid had defeated Cadíz 3–0 the previous day. With his twelfth title for the club overall, he overtook Zidane as the manager with the second–most title victories with Real Madrid, behind only Miguel Muñoz (14). In the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals on 9 May, Real Madrid made a late comeback to achieve a 2–1 home win over Bayern Munich and advance to the 2024 UEFA Champions League final 4–3 on aggregate, against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley, Ancelotti&#x27;s record sixth final in the competition. On 1 June, Real Madrid defeated Borussia Dortmund 2–0 to win their 15th Champions League&#x27;s trophy, and Ancelotti&#x27;s fifth title. Two months later, on 14 August, he achieved his record fifth UEFA Super Cup trophy with a 2–0 victory over Atalanta, becoming the joint most decorated coach in the club&#x27;s history along with Miguel Muñoz with 14 titles. Later that year, on 18 December, he clinched his record-breaking 15th title with the club following a 3–0 victory over Pachuca in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup final.

== Style of management and reception ==
Toward the beginning of his coaching career, and during his time with Parma, Ancelotti preferred to use a rigorous 4–4–2 formation, which made use of heavy pressing, and drew influence from that of his Milan and Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi, and which he believed to be the most successful system for his team; however, this system did not allow for more creative forwards, such as Gianfranco Zola, Hristo Stoichkov and Roberto Baggio, to play in their preferred positions, and ultimately led to Zola and Stoichkov&#x27;s departure from the club, while Baggio&#x27;s transfer to Parma in 1997 was impeded by Ancelotti. Ancelotti later stated that he regretted his intransigence, and when he joined Juventus, he abandoned his favoured 4–4–2 in favour of a 3–4–1–2 system, in order to accommodate Zinedine Zidane in his preferred advanced playmaking role behind the forwards. In addition to Sacchi, Ancelotti has also cited his former Roma manager Nils Liedholm, and his youth coach Bruno Mora as major influences. The positive leadership style of his Roma manager Sven-Göran Eriksson also inspired Ancelotti&#x27;s own coaching style.

Despite his initial reputation as a tactically inflexible coach, with Milan Ancelotti later drew praise for his ability to find systems which would best suit his players, and which allowed several talented and creative players to co-exist; under Ancelotti&#x27;s management, the club enjoyed one of the most fruitful spells in its history. Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s Milan sides almost always used a strong four-man back-line, a main striker and an attacking midfielder. In his first seasons with the club, although he was initially criticised by the club&#x27;s president Berlusconi, due to his supposedly defensive tactics, Ancelotti was able to implement a more creative playing style based on possession when he notably adopted a 4–3–1–2, 4–1–2–1–2 or 4–4–2 diamond formation. While still preserving the team&#x27;s strong defensive line, Ancelotti converted attacking midfielder Andrea Pirlo to a deep-lying playmaker, which saw him play in a seemingly defensive midfield role in front of the back-line, and behind the team&#x27;s advanced playmaker, either Rui Costa or Rivaldo, giving the Italian more time on the ball to orchestrate the team&#x27;s attacking moves from deeper areas, or to create goalscoring opportunities for the team&#x27;s prolific strikers with his accurate long passing ability; the team&#x27;s two playmakers were supported defensively by box-to-box midfielders on either side of them in the midfield diamond. Due to competition from Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini, Roque Júnior, Dario Šimić, and later Jaap Stam in defence, he also converted former centre-back Alessandro Costacurta to a defensive left-back, alternating him with Kakha Kaladze or Giuseppe Pancaro, while, due to the club&#x27;s narrow midfield, the club&#x27;s attacking right-back, Cafu, was given licence to attack and provide width to the team; due to Cafu&#x27;s offensive capabilities, Ancelotti occasionally fielded a 4–4–1–1 or 3–4–1–2 formation, which saw Cafu used as an outright winger, along with Serginho or Marek Jankulovski on the left.

After the departure of one of the club&#x27;s main strikers at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Andriy Shevchenko, Ancelotti redesigned Milan&#x27;s line-up, devising a 4–3–2–1 system, later known as his &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; formation. Milan&#x27;s line-up used either Filippo Inzaghi or Alberto Gilardino as a lone striker, supported by two attacking midfielders, Clarence Seedorf and Kaká, in front of a three-man midfield which once again featured Andrea Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker, supported by two hard-working defensive midfielders, such as Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, or Cristian Brocchi.

Moving to Chelsea, in the 2009–10 season Ancelotti continued with the 4–4–2 diamond formation used previously at Milan, often with Michael Essien or Mikel John Obi in the defensive role, Michael Ballack or Frank Lampard as box to box midfielders and Deco in a creative role, with full-backs Ashley Cole and José Bosingwa pushing forward and providing width to the narrow midfield. Later in the season the Africa Cup of Nations left Chelsea without strikers Salomon Kalou or Didier Drogba (as well as midfielders Essien and Mikel) and harder to play with a 4–4–2, so Ancelotti switched to the 4–3–2–1 &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; formation he had also used at Milan, using Joe Cole and Florent Malouda to support lone striker Nicolas Anelka. He also used the 4–2–3–1 and 4–3–3 to be less predictable and better use creative players like Lampard and Malouda.

At Real Madrid, Ancelotti similarly drew praise for his versatility; he modified the team&#x27;s 4–2–3–1 formation, which had been used under José Mourinho, to a 4–4–2 formation, before settling on a 4–3–3 formation, in which Argentine former winger Ángel Di María was converted to a left-sided central midfielder, while Cristiano Ronaldo was played in his preferred free role on the left wing rather than as a striker, as Ancelotti had initially intended. Di María particularly excelled in this new role and played a key role in the club&#x27;s successes. Ancelotti later explained that his use of Cristiano Ronaldo in a free role on the left flank was due to the fact that the winger&#x27;s style of play was less suited to a playing with his back to goal as a centre-forward; the wider role instead allowed him space to roam freely around the attack. Striker Karim Benzema was instead tasked with acting as a false 9 in the centre, while Bale played as an inverted winger on the opposite flank to Ronaldo. Although he initially sought to use an offensive-minded possession–based style, he instead adopted a quick counter-attacking style, as he noticed that his players were more suited to attacking in that manner.

In addition to his tactical prowess and adaptability, Ancelotti has also drawn praise for his kindness, good humour, and his calm, balanced approach as a manager, as well as his ability to motivate his players and cultivate a good relationship with them, and foster a united, winning team environment, although he has also been known to lose his temper at times. During Ancelotti&#x27;s first season with Bayern Munich, Spanish midfielder Thiago praised Ancelotti for the freedom he gave the players to express themselves and for the confidence with which he instilled them; Ancelotti commented on the tactical changes he implemented at Bayern Munich, stating &quot;[t]he main change is we press a bit more intermittently and we try to play more directly, more vertically,&quot; also adding that &quot;if you&#x27;re organised even an ordinary player can do very well because he&#x27;ll have options and he&#x27;ll know where they are and how to find them. But when you get to the final third, everything changes. That&#x27;s where you need creativity and freedom because without it you only have sterile possession. Especially if your opponent&#x27;s defence is organised and has been paying attention&quot;.

During his second spell at Real Madrid, although he implemented a more simple but effective counter–attacking style with the team, Ancelotti once again earned praise in the media for his balanced approach, adaptability, and man–management abilities during the club&#x27;s run to a Liga–Champions League double; his ability to develop a strong relationship with his players and his willingness to consult them on tactical decisions were singled out by several pundits in particular as reasons for the team&#x27;s success and unity. Regarding this aspect of his coaching philosophy, he commented in 2022: &quot;I think that the methodology of training in football has changed a lot in the last 20 years. So I&#x27;ve had to be ready to change my style and my idea of football, because the rules have changed. It&#x27;s a completely different sport. But what hasn&#x27;t changed is my relationship with the players. That&#x27;s the same.&quot; In contrast to his first spell in the Spanish capital, Benzema was now given a free attacking role, becoming the focal point of the team&#x27;s offensive line; this new role enabled the striker to be extremely prolific, which was a key component to the team&#x27;s success.

In an episode of &quot;Universo Valdano&quot; in 2022, Ancelotti commented on his coaching style in the latter part of his career: &quot;I am not an obsessive person. I like football a lot, it&#x27;s a passion of mine, but I try to keep things as simple as possible. Football for me isn&#x27;t complicated.&quot; He also said that he preferred to instruct his players on the defensive part of the game – as it requires more organisation – rather than the attacking aspect of the game, so as not to stifle their creativity going forward. He later also commented on his style in 2023 in comparison to other managers: &quot;The mistakes that the new generation of coaches make is that they give too much information to the players about the game in possession. I&#x27;m old school and I think this takes a bit of creativity away. It&#x27;s one thing to tell them the position without the ball, where you have to work hard and play as a team, but in possession, if they&#x27;re comfortable when they come a bit wider, I&#x27;m not going to tell them to go inside. It&#x27;s an individual interpretation of the game with the ball and I don&#x27;t want to take away each player&#x27;s creativity.&quot; However, he later dismissed criticism that he was an &quot;old–school&quot; manager, citing his longevity and success as evidence of his adaptability.

In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, in the lead-up to the 2024 Champions League final, he commented on the limits of teams having &quot;only one identity,&quot; also adding that his &quot;style&quot; was &quot;not recognised&quot; because he changed. He said that against Roberto De Zerbi&#x27;s Shakhtar Donetsk, en route to his last Champions League title, he instructed his players not to press them, so that they would not play through the team. He similarly demonstrated that his team defended in a low block against Manchester City in the knock-out stages, as he saw that as the most effective way to defeat them, but that normally his side are more offensive. He elaborated that during the current season he used a 4–3–1–2 without a genuine forward, in order to compensate for the departure of striker Benzema. Jude Bellingham served as a goalscoring attacking midfielder, with additional creative and defensive responsibilities, acting almost as a false-9 or second striker at times, and playing behind Vinícius and Rodrygo – normally wingers – upfront in free roles. Bellingham flourished in this position, with Ancelotti earning praise from Ben Grounds of &quot;Sky Sports&quot; for fielding him in this new role. While Vinícus and Rodrygo were still given the freedom to move out wide in attack, Ancelotti also focussed on developing their ability to play more effectively in central areas. He also used a 4–4–2 formation at times throughout the season. Despite injuries to three of his team&#x27;s key players – Thibaut Courtois, David Alaba and Éder Militão – Real Madrid won another Liga–Champions League double that season, with Ancelotti noting that &quot;attitude and commitment&quot; were &quot;the key to overcoming all the problems&quot; the club had faced.

Nicknamed &quot;Don Carlo&quot; by the Spanish media, and &quot;Re Carlo&quot; in the Italian press (&quot;King Charles&quot; in Italian), Ancelotti is regarded as one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time, and has drawn praise in the press for his longevity as well as his record–breaking achievements. Despite becoming the first manager to win the league title in the top five European football leagues, Ancelotti&#x27;s domestic record, and his lack of numerous league titles in comparison to his record-breaking success in European club competitions, has occasionally been criticised in the media. In 2015, Miguel Delaney of &quot;ESPN&quot; concluded that Ancelotti&#x27;s more relaxed management style is more suited to winning cup competitions that are &quot;far more open to blind luck and all the one-off nuances,&quot; in contrast to autocratic managers like Pep Guardiola, Alex Ferguson, and José Mourinho, who have amassed better domestic records and more league championships. Ancelotti himself has also referenced this discrepancy in the title of his autobiography, which translates to &quot;I prefer Cups&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Ancelotti has two children: a daughter, and a son, Davide, who was his assistant coach at Everton, and now also at Real Madrid. Davide previously also played in the Milan youth team and joined Borgomanero in June 2008. In 2008, Ancelotti confirmed in an interview that he had broken up with his wife of 25 years, Luisa Gibellini. He subsequently dated Romanian Marina Crețu. In 2011, it was announced he was dating Canadian businesswoman Mariann Barrena McClay. Ancelotti and Barrena McClay married in Vancouver in July 2014.

In May 2009, Ancelotti&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Preferisco la Coppa&quot; (&quot;&quot;I Prefer the Cup&quot;, with a word-play by Ancelotti on the Italian word &quot;coppa&quot;&quot; that stands both for &quot;cup&quot; and a type of cured cold pork meat cut, which is produced in Ancelotti&#x27;s native region of Emilia-Romagna), was published, with all proceeds from sales of the book going to the Fondazione Stefano Borgonovo for the funding of research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In his last season with Chelsea, Ancelotti had to travel back to Italy on a regular basis to visit his 87-year-old father who was in poor health with diabetes and other issues. On the issue, he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t have a problem managing the team for this reason. It&#x27;s difficult, emotionally, when it&#x27;s your father... but this is life. I have to do my best to stay close to him, but this is the life.&quot; His father died on 29 September 2010, aged 87.

On 31 January 2019, Ancelotti became the grandfather of twins, born to his son Davide&#x27;s wife Ana Galocha. He is a Roman Catholic. In February 2021, Ancelotti&#x27;s home in Crosby was burgled and a safe stolen by two male offenders wearing black clothing and balaclavas. The safe was later found dumped in a car park in nearby Thornton. It had been forced open and stripped of its contents. Ancelotti is among the 13 sports personalities mentioned in the Pandora Papers published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). On 11 October 2023, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Parma, following his research in &quot;Sciences and Techniques of Preventive and Adapted Motor Activities&quot;.

<text>Snagglepuss is a fictional cartoon character who debuted in prototype form on &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot; in 1959 and was established as a studio regular by 1961. A light pink anthropomorphic puma sporting an upturned collar, shirt cuffs, and bow tie, Snagglepuss enjoys the finer things in life and shows a particular affinity for the theatre. His stories routinely break the fourth wall as the character addresses the audience in self-narration, soliloquy, and asides. As originally voiced by Daws Butler, Snagglepuss seeks quasi-Shakespearean turns of phrase. Some of his campy verbal mannerisms became catchphrases: &quot;Heavens to Murgatroyd!&quot;, &quot;Exit, stage left!&quot;, and using emphatic &quot;even&quot; at the end of sentences.

==History==
A pink puma known as &quot;Snaggletooth&quot;, featuring the eventual character&#x27;s general manner and Bert Lahr–inspired voice but without collar or cuffs, first appeared on television in &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot; in 1959. The character subsequently appeared in a supporting role in &quot;Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy&quot; and &quot;Snooper and Blabber&quot;. Under the revised name of Snagglepuss, the character appeared in his own series of shorts in 1961 as a regular segment on &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;, featuring in 32 episodes. He later appeared in other Hanna-Barbera shows, including &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Gang&quot; (1973), as a co-host in &quot;Laff-A-Lympics&quot; (1977–78), &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot; (1985), and as a teenager in &quot;Yo Yogi!&quot; (1991).

Snagglepuss&#x27;s appearance in a 1960s run of Kellogg&#x27;s cereal television commercials prompted legal action by actor Bert Lahr, who said the similarity of the character&#x27;s voice to his own could lead viewers to the false conclusion that Lahr himself had endorsed the product. As part of the settlement, the disclaimer &quot;Snagglepuss voice by Daws Butler&quot; was required to appear on each commercial. This made Butler one of the few voice artists to receive screen credits in a TV commercial.

Butler reused his Snagglepuss voice for two other Hanna-Barbera characters: Jonathan Wellington &quot;Mudsy&quot; Muddlemore in &quot;The Funky Phantom&quot; and Brutus the Lion in &quot;The Roman Holidays&quot;.

==Character description==
Snagglepuss lives in a cavern, which he constantly tries to make more habitable for himself. No matter what he does, however, he always winds up back where he started or worse off than he was before. In some episodes, Snagglepuss is chased by Major Minor (voiced by Don Messick), a tiny-sized hunter. A few episodes involved him trying to court a lioness named Lila (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl) but who always rejected his advances for being too boorish or pathetic.

Butler&#x27;s voicing of the character recalls the work of actor Bert Lahr, especially the more mellow moods of Lahr&#x27;s Cowardly Lion in the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Snagglepuss has three signature catchphrases. His most famous is his perpetual exclamation &quot;Heavens to Murgatroyd!&quot; Before dashing offscreen to make an escape or run an errand, Snagglepuss announces the move in the form of a theatrical stage direction, saying &quot;Exit, stage left/right/up/down!&quot;. Finally, Snagglepuss tends to add the word &quot;even&quot; for emphasis at the ends of sentences:
* After emphasizing a previous statement (&quot;Somebody hurt! In dire pain, even!&quot;).
* After stating a synonymous phrase (&quot;On account of I must be a little rusty. Stale, even&quot;).
* In a grammatically correct way, though out of order in the sentence (&quot;I wonder if he knows my telephone number, even&quot;).
* Simply added as an exclamation (&quot;Heavens to Murgatroyd! A veritabububble frankenmouse monster, even!&quot;).

The character&#x27;s pink color, lilting voice, and theatrical manner led some viewers to interpret Snagglepuss as stereotypically gay. This implication was echoed over the years in many parodies, then seriously explored in the 2018 comic miniseries &quot;Exit, Stage Left!: The Snagglepuss Chronicles&quot; from DC Comics, part of their &quot;Hanna-Barbera Beyond&quot; initiative.

==List of episodes==

==Other appearances==
===Hanna-Barbera===
* Snagglepuss appeared in &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Ark Lark&quot; (1972) and &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Gang&quot; (1973). In &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Gang&quot;, he is often referred to as a tiger and not a mountain lion.
* Snagglepuss acted as a co-host with Mildew Wolf from the &quot;Cattanooga Cats&quot; segment &quot;It&#x27;s the Wolf&quot; on &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Star Laff-A-Lympics&quot; and &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Stars&quot; (1977–79).
* Snagglepuss made a special guest appearance at a celebrity roast honoring Fred Flintstone in the TV special &quot;Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s All-Star Comedy Ice Revue&quot; (1978).
* Snagglepuss also appeared in the animated holiday specials &quot;Casper&#x27;s First Christmas&quot; (1979), &quot;Yogi&#x27;s First Christmas&quot; (1980) and &quot;Yogi Bear&#x27;s All Star Comedy Christmas Caper&quot; (1982).
* Snagglepuss was a regular in &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;.
* Snagglepuss appeared in four television films which were part of the &quot;Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10&quot; series:
** &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Great Escape&quot; (1987)
** &quot;Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose&quot; (1987)
** &quot;The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound&quot; (1988)
* Snagglepuss appeared in &quot;A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration: 50 Years of Hanna-Barbera&quot; (1989).
* In the &quot;Fender Bender 500&quot; segment of &quot;Wake, Rattle, and Roll&quot;, Snagglepuss was paired up with Huckleberry Hound as they drove a monster truck called the Half-Dog, Half-Cat, Half-track; it resembled a portable stage, which was perfectly appropriate for both Huck and Snag.
* Snagglepuss was featured as a teenager in &quot;Yo Yogi!&quot;, again voiced by Greg Burson.
* Snagglepuss was seen in a Cartoon Network Rap in 1995.
* Snagglepuss made a non-speaking cameo in the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; episode &quot;Peanut Puberty&quot;.
* Snagglepuss starred in an eight-page DC Comics&#x27; story within &quot;Suicide Squad/Banana Splits Annual&quot; #1 by writer Mark Russell and artist Mike Feehan. The eight-page story was then followed by a 6-issue comic miniseries &quot;Exit, Stage Left!: The Snagglepuss Chronicles&quot; (also by Mark Russell) with the first issue released on January 3, 2018. The comic depicted Snagglepuss as a gay playwright living in 1950s New York City whose career featured parallels to that of Tennessee Williams and was also given a male human lover named Pablo who he was in a closeted relationship with. The comics also featured Huckleberry Hound and Quick Draw McGraw as supporting characters who were also in a gay relationship that were initially supportive of Snagglepuss only for their own lives to fall to ruin due to a McCarthyist purge which ends up putting Huckleberry in jail. The comic later won a GLAAD Award for Outstanding Comic Book.
* Snagglepuss appears in the &quot;Wacky Races&quot; episode &quot;Much Ado About Wacky&quot;.
* Snagglepuss appears in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;, voiced by Dana Snyder. He appears as one of the many residents in the cartoon town of Jellystone where he works for the entertainment industry. He is also gay, according to Melody Iza.
* A new Snagglepuss animated series is currently in development, to be voiced by Jim Parsons.

===Non-Hanna-Barbera===
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Sweet Seymour Skinner&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; (April 28, 1994), Miss Hoover reminds Ralph Wiggum that he once reported seeing Snagglepuss outside in the hallway. Ralph responds, &quot;he was going to the bathroom&quot;. In the other episode &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot; (May 12, 1994), Comic Book Guy shows Bart a cel of Snagglepuss as an example of a cel that is actually worth something, as opposed to the cel of Scratchy&#x27;s arm that Bart was trying to sell to him.
* Snagglepuss appeared in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Ban on the Fun&quot;, voiced by Victor Yerrid. In the &quot;Laff-A-Munich&quot; skit, he is seen on a television set, telling the audience about the disappearance of the Yogi Yahooeys.
* In the adult animated sitcom &quot;Drawn Together&quot;, Snagglepuss is featured in the episode &quot;Gay Bash&quot;, but his face is blurred, referencing how strangers are blurred on reality programs. He was voiced by Chris Edgerly.
* Snagglepuss made a brief cameo in &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; episode &quot;Irwin Gets a Clue&quot;, being hit by Hoss Delgado&#x27;s truck.
* Snagglepuss made two cameos in a MetLife commercial in 2012, titled &quot;Everyone&quot;. In a behind the scenes video, Snagglepuss (voiced by Stephen Stanton) acts and rehearses in front of the director of the ad, only for the director to tell him he does not have any speaking roles in the ad, and in response, Snagglepuss storms out of the trailer.
* On a Season 34: Episode 8 &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (November 15, 2008), Bobby Moynihan appears in costume as Snagglepuss to comment on California&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage. During the segment, Snagglepuss is &quot;outed&quot; by anchor Seth Meyers and then confesses that his domestic partner is fellow Hanna-Barbera cartoon character The Great Gazoo, who also makes a cameo played by Will Forte.
* Snagglepuss made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; revival segment &quot;Suffragette City&quot;.
* Snagglepuss made several cameos in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;.

<doc id="1142809" wikidata="Q1100609" url="?curid=1142809" title="Matt Lauer">
<text>Matthew Todd Lauer (; born December 30, 1957) is a former American television news personality, best known for his work with NBC News. After serving as a local news personality in New York City on WNBC, his first national exposure was as the news anchor for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; from 1994 to 1997. In 1997, Lauer was moved from the news desk to the host&#x27;s chair and was co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot; from 1997 to 2017. He was also a frequent contributor to the evening news magazine &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;. With NBC, Lauer hosted the annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and co-hosted the opening ceremonies of several Olympic Games.

In November 2017, Lauer&#x27;s contract was terminated by NBC after NBC reported receiving &quot;a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace&quot; and added that NBC had &quot;reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.&quot;

== Early life ==
Lauer was born in New York City, the son of Marilyn Lauer, a boutique owner, and Jay Robert Lauer, a bicycle company executive.

Lauer&#x27;s father was of Romanian Jewish ancestry, as seen on the &quot;Today Show&quot;″s &quot;Finding Our Roots.&quot; Lauer said, &quot;My dad was Jewish. My mom is not. So I was not raised anything. I do feel a desire now to find something spiritual. Getting married and wanting to have kids has something to do with that.&quot;

== Education and early career ==
Lauer earned his undergraduate degree from Ohio University at age 39 in 1997; he had studied at the school&#x27;s Scripps College of Communication, School of Media Arts and Studies. Lauer had dropped out of the same institution in the spring of 1979 to begin his television career, after he was hired as a producer of the noon newscast for WOWK-TV in Huntington, West Virginia. By 1980, Lauer had become an on-air reporter for the station&#x27;s 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts.

Lauer then moved around the East Coast, hosting a number of daily information and talk programs. He was a co-host of &quot;PM Magazine&quot; in several cities, beginning in Richmond (1980–1981), then Providence (1981–1984), and then New York City (1984–1986). After the New York edition of &quot;PM Magazine&quot; was canceled by WNYW in 1986, Lauer and co-host Jill Rappaport worked on a new show for the station, &quot;Made in New York&quot;, which ran for fifteen weeks. This was followed by Lauer gaining his first national television exposure, as he joined Robin Leach in co-hosting ABC&#x27;s short-lived daytime series &quot;Fame, Fortune and Romance&quot;, a spin-off of the syndicated &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;. Lauer then returned to local television, hosting programs in Philadelphia and Boston for a two-year period between 1987 and 1989, during which time he reported for ESPN and anchored entertainment news segments for HBO.

In September 1989, Lauer returned to New York City, this time to WWOR, and built his career and fame, where he hosted &quot;9 Broadcast Plaza&quot;, a three-hour live interview program. Lauer departed that series as it took a turn in booking &quot;tabloid&quot; guests and topics, and for what he relayed as a refusal to live-read ads on the show for Dial-a-Mattress. WWOR-TV replaced Lauer with various guest hosts Buzz Luttrell Robb Weller, Robin Leach, Steve Edwards, Weird Al Yankovic, Howard Stern, Richard Bey, and &quot;9 Broadcast Plaza&quot; eventually morphed into &quot;The Richard Bey Show&quot;.

At this time, Lauer was also the original primary host of a Cinemax interstitial show, called &quot;Beyond the Screen&quot; (1988 - 1997; it was interstitial because the show aired on interstitial breaks between programs), which was popular on Cinemax, causing them to topple HBO in the ratings. In this show, Matt, and many other hosts, would interview many celebrities such as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Nicole Kidman, Talia Shire, Selma Blair, Jerry Seinfeld, Annabella Sciorra, Kirsten Dunst, EPMD, Tupac, John Singleton, Samuel L. Jackson, Sean Nelson, and many others, for their upcoming movies. &quot;The Godfather Part III,&quot; &quot;GoodFellas&quot;, &quot;Juice,&quot; and &quot;Fresh,&quot; were among the movies that had their behind-the-scenes featurette premieres on Cinemax, via this show.

In 1990, Lauer was hired by the Kushner-Locke Company to host a pilot called &quot;Day in Court&quot;, executive-produced by veteran producer David Sams, who helped to launch &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; into national syndication. The program was retitled &quot;Trial Watch&quot; when it went to series and ran on the NBC network for two seasons. NBC hired Robb Weller as host over Lauer when the program was picked up as a daily series. That same year, Lauer filmed a pilot for the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s bodybuilding spinoff, the World Bodybuilding Federation for USA Network known as &quot;WBF BodyStars&quot;, though WWF owner/chairman Vince McMahon later decided to host the program himself. In 1991, Lauer appeared as the co-host (along with Willow Bay) of &quot;Etc., Etc.&quot;, a show on the Travel Channel.

== Career at NBC News ==
Lauer joined NBC in 1992 when he became co-anchor of the early weekday news show &quot;Today in New York&quot; on the network&#x27;s New York flagship station WNBC. The following year, Lauer filled the role of &quot;Live at Five&quot; co-anchor with Sue Simmons, eventually taking the role permanently and giving up the morning shift by 1994; he was replaced on &quot;Today in New York&quot; by Maurice DuBois. Lauer remained on &quot;Live at Five&quot; until 1996.

Lauer&#x27;s on-camera presence would soon provide him many opportunities with NBC News. Lauer filled in as the newsreader on &quot;The Today Show&quot; for Margaret Larson when needed from 1992 to 1993. This &quot;audition&quot; period allowed him to join &quot;The Today Show&quot; full-time in January 1994 as a news anchor while still co-anchoring &quot;Today in New York&quot; and &quot;Live at Five&quot;.

Lauer stepped in for Scott Simon, Mike Schneider, Jack Ford and David Bloom as the co-host of &quot;Weekend Today&quot;, and for Ann Curry as anchor of the former NBC News program &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot; from 1992 to 1997. He had also filled in for Tom Brokaw on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. As the &quot;Today Show&quot; news anchor, Lauer also substituted for Bryant Gumbel on the &quot;Today Show&quot; before being named the official co-anchor on January 6, 1997, after Gumbel stepped down. On top of Lauer&#x27;s duties on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, Lauer also hosted programming on Discovery Channel and MSNBC.

From 1998 until 2011, Lauer embarked on what was generally an annual five-day, globe-spanning adventure called &quot;Where in the World is Matt Lauer?&quot; on the &quot;Today Show&quot; during TV sweeps. The segment was named after the PBS game show &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; from which it borrowed the theme song. This segment sent Lauer to various locations worldwide, from where he reported on the importance of each location. Lauer broadcast from locations including Bhutan, Easter Island, the Panama Canal, Iran, Hong Kong, Croatia, and the Great Wall of China. In 2011, NBC News postponed the segment in consideration of the stagnant, unstable U.S. economy.

On some occasions, Lauer conducted interviews that escalated into tense exchanges. During a June 2005 interview with Tom Cruise, Lauer argued with Cruise about psychiatry and postpartum depression, and Cruise called Lauer &quot;glib.&quot; In December 2008, Cruise said he regretted the exchange.

On June 19, 2007, Lauer interviewed Prince William and Prince Harry on the tenth anniversary of the death of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Between 1998 and 2017, Lauer co-hosted NBC&#x27;s live coverage of Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

Lauer co-hosted the opening ceremonies of several Olympic Games, carrying on what his former co-host Katie Couric had done since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Lauer co-hosted the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics, the 2010 Winter Olympics, the 2012 Summer Olympics, the 2014 Winter Olympics, and the 2016 Summer Olympics. His commentary on the 2012 opening ceremonies, along with that of co-hosts Meredith Vieira and Bob Costas, came under fierce criticism, being described as &quot;ignorant&quot; and &quot;banal&quot;.

On April 5, 2012, Lauer announced that he had signed a new contract with NBC News through 2017. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that the contract paid Lauer $25 million a year.

It has been widely reported that Lauer had influenced co-anchor Ann Curry&#x27;s departure from &quot;The Today Show&quot;, executed by its executive producer Jim Bell under the name &quot;Operation Bambi.&quot;

During the 2014 Winter Olympics, Lauer replaced prime-time host Bob Costas from February 11–14, after Costas suffered a major eye infection.

In November 2015, Lauer hosted an interview with Charlie Sheen, during which Sheen revealed that he was HIV-positive.

On September 8, 2016, Lauer conducted separate 30-minute interviews with presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, both of which were met with much criticism. Lauer devoted much of the Clinton interview to questions about her e-mail server and, according to critics, appeared to rush through audience-led topics such as domestic terror attacks and veterans&#x27; affairs, implying that there was not enough time to cover these in detail. Many also felt that Lauer failed to challenge Trump on alleged inaccuracies, such as his statement that he was &quot;totally against the war in Iraq,&quot; which other sources called &quot;lies.&quot; CNN reported that the short amount of time for the interviews, the short notice with which they were conducted, and the small amount of audience questions were a major reason for the poor reviews.

On November 30, 2016, it was revealed that Lauer had signed a new contract up to 2018. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that his salary was $20 million per year. On January 6, 2017, Lauer celebrated his 20th anniversary on &quot;The Today Show&quot; with a look back at some of his most memorable moments on the show.

== Sexual misconduct allegations ==

In 2008, Lauer was the subject of a roast by the New York Friars Club where several of his colleagues made jokes about his reputation for having relationships with his staff.

On November 29, 2017, NBC News announced that Lauer&#x27;s employment had been terminated after an unidentified female NBC employee reported that Lauer had sexually harassed her during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia and that the harassment continued after they returned to New York. Andrew Lack, chairman of NBC News, sent a memorandum to his staff that said, in part, &quot;On Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. ... While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he&#x27;s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.&quot; A network executive said Lauer would not receive any form of monetary settlement because he was fired &quot;for cause&quot;. Lauer&#x27;s last day on air was November 28, 2017. His contract had been scheduled to run through the end of 2018.

NBC News management said it had been aware that &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;, Ronan Farrow cited multiple sources who stated that NBC News was not only aware of Lauer&#x27;s misconduct beforehand, but that Harvey Weinstein used this knowledge to pressure the program into killing a story that would have outed his own sexual assaults. &quot;Variety&quot; reported allegations by at least ten of Lauer&#x27;s current and former colleagues. Additional accusations went public in the ensuing days. NBC acknowledged three additional cases from 2000 to 2007.

In &quot;Catch and Kill&quot;, Farrow reveals one of the alleged victims as Brooke Nevils, who says Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room while the two were in Sochi covering the 2014 Winter Olympics for NBC. Farrow also writes in his book that Nevils had additional sexual encounters with Lauer after the initial incident, but she characterized those encounters as &quot;transactional&quot;, and consented only out of fear that Lauer had control over her career.

In a statement made after his firing, Lauer apologized for his actions, saying, &quot;Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.&quot; Following Nevils&#x27; allegation of sexual assault that was published in Farrow&#x27;s book, Lauer issued an open letter confirming that he had a consensual sexual relationship with Nevils and that the relationship started in 2014 in Sochi, but denying that the initial encounter was non-consensual.

Two weeks after Lauer&#x27;s firing, Addie Zinone, a former &quot;Today&quot; production assistant, made an additional accusation, saying that she had a consensual sexual relationship with Lauer in June 2000. Zinone claimed that the relationship was an &quot;abuse of power&quot; on Lauer&#x27;s part because Zinone said that she felt that turning down Lauer&#x27;s advances would have hurt her career.

According to Farrow, &quot;Today&quot; show booker Melissa Lonner claims that Lauer exposed himself to her in 2010 at an NBC cocktail party. He denies this claim and, through his lawyer, said, &quot;he will not take part in the marketing circus of this book.&quot;

== Other work ==
Lauer made several guest appearances on the NBC sitcom 30 rock created by Tina Fey 

Lauer made a guest appearance as himself on a live episode of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; in early 2006.

In November 2006, Lauer and his daughter, Romy, hosted the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; direct-to-DVD show &quot;Sesame Beginnings: Exploring Together&quot;. Lauer hosted &quot;The Greatest American&quot; on the Discovery Channel, which used internet and telephone voting by viewers to select the winner. Lauer was critical of his program since it tended to favor well-known figures over others who had less influence in pop culture.

Lauer served as the 2009 Class Day speaker at Harvard University&#x27;s undergraduate commencement ceremonies on June 3, 2009.

Lauer has appeared as himself in the 2009 film &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, the 2011 film &quot;The Beaver&quot; and voiced reporter Hark Hanson in the direct–to–DVD animated sequel &quot;Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!&quot; Lauer also made appearances in the 2011 films &quot;Drew Peterson: Untouchable&quot; and &quot;Tower Heist&quot;; archival footage of Lauer is shown in the 2015 film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; and the 2017 films &quot;Lady Bird&quot; and &quot;I, Tonya&quot;. He also appeared as himself in the TV movies &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot; and &quot;Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!&quot;

Lauer is the grandson of singer Art Gentry. Lauer was married to television producer Nancy Alspaugh from 1982 to 1989. They had no children.

Lauer proposed to Roque after five months of dating, and the two wed in Bridgehampton, New York on October 3, 1998. They have three children together.

In 2006, while pregnant, Roque filed for divorce alleging &quot;mental abuse, extreme mental and emotional distress, humiliation, torment, and anxiety&quot; by Lauer. They reconciled weeks later. On September 7, 2019, Lauer and Roque officially divorced, following nearly two years of separation in the wake of his 2017 sexual harassment allegations.

<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Denmark since 15 June 2012. A bill for the legalization of same-sex marriages was introduced by the Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet, and approved 85–24 by the Folketing on 7 June 2012. It received royal assent by Queen Margrethe II on 12 June and took effect three days later. Polling indicates that a significant majority of Danes support the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Denmark was the fourth Nordic country, after Norway, Sweden and Iceland, the eighth in Europe and the eleventh in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. It was the first country in the world to enact registered partnerships, which provided same-sex couples with almost all of the rights and benefits of marriage, in 1989.

Same-sex marriage is also legal in the two other constituent countries of the Danish Realm:
* In Greenland, legislation to allow same-sex marriage passed the Inatsisartut on 26 May 2015. The Danish Parliament ratified the legislation on 19 January 2016 and the law took effect on 1 April 2016.
* In the Faroe Islands, same-sex marriage legislation passed the Løgting on 29 April 2016. The legislation was ratified by the Danish Parliament on 25 April 2017 and received royal assent on 3 May. The law took effect on 1 July 2017.

==Legal history==
===Denmark===
====Registered partnerships====
Registered partnerships (, ) were established in Denmark by a law passed on 7 June 1989, and which came into force on 1 October 1989. It was the first such law in the world. Attempts to expand the law in May 2003, in June 2003, and in June 2006 failed in Parliament. The law was successfully expanded regarding adoption rights and the care of children in June 2009, and in May 2010. On 17 March 2009, legislation granting registered partners the right to adopt children jointly was introduced to the Folketing. The bill was approved 60–54 on 4 May 2010 and took effect on 1 July 2010. 

Registered partnerships had almost all the same qualities as marriage. All legal and fiscal rights and obligations were identical to those of opposite-sex marriages, with the following two exceptions: laws making explicit reference to the sexes of a married couple did not apply to registered partnerships; and regulations by international treaties did not apply unless all signatories agreed. Divorce for registered partners followed the same rules as opposite-sex divorces. Registered partners had to meet one of the following residency requirements to form a union: (1) one partner had to be a Danish citizen and be resident in Denmark, or (2) both parties must have been resident in Denmark for at least two years. Citizens of Finland, Iceland and Norway were treated as Danish citizens for the purpose of the residency requirement. Additionally, the Justice Ministry could order that a citizen of any other country with a registered partnership law similar to Denmark&#x27;s be treated as a Danish citizen. Registered partnerships were conducted by civil ceremony only, but the Church of Denmark allowed priests to perform blessings of same-sex relationships. On 15 June 2012, the partnership law was repealed and replaced by a gender-neutral marriage law. Entering into new registered partnerships is no longer possible, though existing ones remain valid.

Denmark&#x27;s role in being the first country in the world to provide almost all of the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples caught international attention. A two-year study of the registered partnership law by researcher Darren Spedale found that same-sex couples were more likely to register their union and less likely to divorce than opposite-sex married couples in Denmark. In particular, same-sex registered partners with children had very low rates of divorce as compared to opposite-sex couples.

====Same-sex marriage====
In 2006, five Social Liberal MPs introduced a resolution asking the Cabinet of Denmark to draft a gender-neutral marriage law. The resolution was debated in Parliament and opposed by members of the conservative governing coalition. The Minister for the Family, Carina Christensen, argued that registered partners already had the same rights as married partners except for the ability to marry in church, and thus that gender-neutral marriage was unnecessary. In January 2008, the Social Liberal Party&#x27;s Equality Rapporteur, Lone Dybkjær, called for the legalization of same-sex marriage. The Copenhagen Mayor for Culture and Recreation, Pia Allerslev, from the liberal then-governing party, also publicly supported same-sex marriage, as did the Lord Mayor of Copenhagen, Ritt Bjerregaard.

In June 2010, the Parliament once again debated a same-sex marriage bill proposed by the opposition parties. It was rejected on a 52–57 vote. A motion calling for legalization was also voted down.

In October 2011, Manu Sareen, the Minister for Equality and Church Affairs, announced that the Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet was seeking to legalize same-sex marriage by spring 2012. On 18 January 2012, the government published two draft bills. One of the bills would introduce a gender-neutral definition of marriage and allow same-sex couples to marry either in civil registry offices or in the Church of Denmark. In addition, registered partners would be able to convert their union into a marriage. The other bill would allow individual priests to refuse to conduct same-sex marriages. Other religious communities would also be allowed to conduct same-sex marriages but would not be compelled to do so. The bills were under consultation until 22 February 2012. On 14 March 2012, the cabinet submitted both bills to the Folketing. The bills were approved 85–24 on 7 June 2012 and received royal assent by Queen Margrethe II on 12 June. The new laws took effect on 15 June 2012. The legislation was opposed by the Danish People&#x27;s Party and the Christian Democrats, a religious conservative party, although the latter were not represented in the Danish Parliament at that time. Under the law, ministers can refuse to carry out a same-sex marriage ceremony, but the local bishop must arrange a replacement for their church building.

Article 1 of the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; () was amended to read as follows:

:&quot;Loven finder anvendelse på ægteskab mellem to personer af forskelligt køn og mellem to personer af samme køn.&quot;

The first same-sex marriage in Denmark occurred on 15 June at the Frederiksberg Church in Copenhagen between Stig Elling and Steen Andersen, who had been together for 27 years.

In Danish, same-sex marriage is known as &quot;ægteskab mellem personer af samme køn&quot; or more commonly as &quot;homovielse&quot; () or &quot;kønsneutrale ægteskab&quot; (, meaning &quot;gender-neutral marriage&quot;).

===Greenland===
Denmark&#x27;s registered partnership law was extended to Greenland on 26 April 1996. Denmark&#x27;s marriage law, as supported by the Naalakkersuisut, was to be considered by the Inatsisartut in the spring of 2014, but was postponed beyond the year due to early parliamentary elections. The legislation to grant same-sex couples marriage and adoption rights had its first reading on 25 March 2015. It was approved unanimously on second reading on 26 May 2015. Ratification of the legislation was required by the Danish Parliament, which granted approval of the law on 19 January 2016. The law came into effect on 1 April 2016.

Greenland&#x27;s registered partnership law was repealed on the same day that the same-sex marriage law came into effect.

===Faroe Islands===

Denmark&#x27;s registered partnership law was never extended to the Faroe Islands, and until 2017 it was the only Nordic region to not recognize same-sex unions in any form. A set of bills to extend the Danish gender-neutral marriage law to the Faroe Islands was submitted to the Løgting on 20 November 2013, though was rejected at second reading on 13 March 2014.

Following the Faroese general election in September 2015, two same-sex marriage bills (one permitting same-sex marriage and the other permitting same-sex divorce) were submitted to the Parliament. The bills received a first reading on 24 November 2015. On 26 April 2016, following a significant amount of parliamentary maneuvering, the same-sex marriage bill passed its second reading by a vote of 19–14. The bill passed its final reading on 29 April 2016. The Danish Parliament voted unanimously to ratify the changes to its own marriage law on 25 April 2017. The Minister of Justice, Søren Pape Poulsen, subsequently allowed the law to go into effect on 1 July 2017, after some minor adjustments regarding the state church had been made.

Legislation exempting the Church of the Faroe Islands from performing same-sex marriages passed the Faroese Parliament on 30 May and went into effect on 1 July 2017 alongside the marriage law. The first same-sex wedding in the Faroe Islands was performed on 6 September 2017.

==Impact==
A study by the Danish Research Institute for Suicide Prevention, released in 2019, showed that the legalisation of same-sex marriage, as well as other supportive policies and legislation, had decreased the suicide rate among same-sex partners. The study, conducted in both Sweden and Denmark, found a 46% fall in suicides of people in same-sex unions between the periods 1989–2002 and 2003–2016, compared to 28% among heterosexual couples.

==Marriage statistics==
The number of same-sex marriages performed in Denmark (excluding Greenland and the Faroe Islands) is shown in the table below. In 2021, the majority of same-sex marriages (79%) were performed in a civil ceremony, while 21% took place in a religious ceremony in the Church of Denmark. One marriage was performed in an embassy or consulate outside of Denmark.

==Religious performance==
Same-sex marriages can be officiated at places of worship of the Church of Denmark and the Church of Greenland, but not the Church of the Faroe Islands, which under the 2017 law that legalised same-sex marriage in the Faroe Islands is exempt from performing same-sex weddings. One of the first same-sex marriage ceremonies in the Church of Denmark occurred on 16 June 2012 at the Højdevang Church on Amager for Poul Cullura and Nicolai Bøcker Jensen. Previously, a priest, Harald Søbye, had married several same-sex couples. He first officiated at the marriage of a male same-sex couple on 8 February 1973 on the suggestion of a journalist from the &quot;Ekstra Bladet&quot; newspaper, which reported it as &quot;the world&#x27;s first gay wedding&quot;. On 25 February 1973, Søbye performed another wedding in a television programme, which was widely reported in the media. Over the following 15 years, Søbye performed approximately 210 blessings or weddings of same-sex couples. The marriages were not legally recognized, and proved controversial within the Church. The Old Catholic Church in Sweden and Denmark and the Forn Siðr — Ásatrú and Vanatrú Association in Denmark also support and solemnise same-sex marriages.

The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. Bishop of Copenhagen Czeslaw Kozon reacted to the declaration, &quot;Everyone must be able to feel at home in the Church, accepted and loved, even if they cannot receive all sacraments... Living in a relationship that is not a marriage, including as persons of the same sex, must therefore not mean a lack of care on the part of the institutional Church or from the community of the congregation. Sexual orientation is not chosen voluntarily... A relationship between two people of the same sex can also contain values such as care and faithfulness...&quot;

==Public opinion==

A YouGov poll conducted between 27 December 2012 and 6 January 2013 found that 79% of Danes supported same-sex marriage and 16% were opposed. The remaining 6% had no opinion on the issue. The same poll also showed that 59% supported same-sex couples&#x27; right to adopt, while 31% were opposed and 11% had no opinion.

A May 2013 Gallup survey from the Faroe Islands found that 68% favoured civil marriage for same-sex couples, with 27% against and 5% undecided. All regions showed majority support and no age groups had more opponents than supporters. A 2014 poll from the Faroe Islands showed that 62% of respondents supported same-sex marriage. The regional divide was significant; support was greater on Streymoy (71% in Norðurstreymoy and 76% in Suðurstreymoy), which includes the capital Tórshavn, than in Norðoyar (42%) and Eysturoy (48%). An August 2014 Faroese poll asking 600 respondents for their views on civil marriage for same-sex couples showed that 61% supported the idea, while 32% were opposed and 7% had no opinion.

The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 87% of Danes supported same-sex marriage, while 9% were opposed and 4% were undecided. A Pew Research Center poll, conducted between April and August 2017 and published in May 2018, showed that 86% of Danes supported same-sex marriage, 9% were opposed and 5% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by religion, 92% of religiously unaffiliated people, 87% of non-practicing Christians and 74% of church-attending Christians supported same-sex marriage. Among 18–34-year-olds, opposition to same-sex marriage was 6%.

The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 89% of Danes thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 8% were opposed. The 2023 Eurobarometer showed that support had increased to 93%, while 5% were opposed. The survey also found that 93% of Danes thought that &quot;there is nothing wrong in a sexual relationship between two persons of the same sex&quot;, while 6% disagreed.

<text>The Westwoods Trails is an extensive hiking trail system in Guilford, Connecticut. The trail system has approximately of trails with features including caves, lakes, streams, rivers, and interesting rock formations. The preserve extends across land owned by the Guilford Land Conservation Trust, which also owns many other land parcels across the town which provide hiking trails, and the State of Connecticut. The trails are accessible for walking, running, and mountain biking. Hunting is only allowed on state land during the season.

==Trail description==
The Westwoods Trails is primarily used for hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, picnicking, and in the winter, snowshoeing.

Portions of the trail are suitable for, and are used for, cross-country skiing and geocaching. Site-specific activities enjoyed along the route include bird watching, hunting (very limited), fishing, horseback riding, bouldering and rock climbing (limited).

===Trail route===
===Trail communities===
The Westwoods Trails are completely contained in the western section of Guilford, Connecticut.
It is very close to the Branford, Connecticut border however and the &#x27;Green Trail&#x27; connects the WestWoods Trails to the Stony Creek Quarry Trails System in Branford, CT.

==Landscape, geology, and natural environment==
==History and folklore==
The Westwoods Trails are maintained on behalf of the land trust by the Westwoods Trails Committee.

==Hiking the trail==

The trails are blazed with several colors as well as shapes. Trail descriptions and maps are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guide to the WestWoods Trails is published in the Connecticut Walk Book East by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association

Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather. Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment.

Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. Wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is recommended.

<doc id="1142842" wikidata="Q2047322" url="?curid=1142842" title="Chilika Lake">
<text>Chilika Lake is the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia and second largest coastal lagoon in the world, covering an area of over . It is spread over the Puri, Khordha and Ganjam districts of Odisha state on the east coast of India, at the mouth of the Daya River, flowing into the Bay of Bengal.

It has been listed as a tentative UNESCO World Heritage site. Its salinity varies by region, from freshwater where rivers flow in, to oceanic salinity levels due to tidal influx.

==History==

Geological evidence indicates that Chilika Lake was part of the Bay of Bengal during the later stages of the Pleistocene period (1.8 million to 10,000 years BP).

Excavations were conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India at Golabai Sasan () north of Chilika lake in Khurdha district. Golabai provides evidence of a sequence of Chilika area culture in three phases: Neolithic (c. 1600 BCE), Chalcolithic (c. 1400 BCE to c. 900 BCE) and Iron Age (c. 900 BCE to c. 800 BCE). Radiocarbon dating traced the earliest level of Golbai to 2300 BCE. The site is located on the left bank of the Malaguni River, a tributary of the Daya River, which flows into Chilika Lake. This location, which gave access to the sea via Chilika Lake, gives evidence of the maritime activities of this region. The recovery of many woodworking adzes and other artifacts shows that Golabal was a boat-building centre. Golabai is the only excavated site in Odisha where boat building has been revealed. This also indicates that Chilika lake was close to Golabai and it facilitated the maritime trade of people in the area during the ancient period.

Ancient texts say the southern sector of Chilika was a major harbour for maritime commerce, when Kharavela (c. 209 BCE–after 170 BCE), the King of Kalinga, was known as the &quot;Lord of the Sea&quot;.

Ptolemy (150 CE), the Greek geographer, referred to Palur as the port &quot;Paloura&quot;, located close to the point of departure situated outside of the southern tip of the lake at Kantiagarh, from where ships bound for different parts of Southeast Asia sailed. After 639, the Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hien and Hiuen-Tsang mention a famous port &quot;Che-li-ta-loChing&quot; near the shore of the ocean which was a thoroughfare and resting place for seagoing traders and strangers from distant lands. This port was located at &#x27;Chhatragarh&#x27; on the banks of Chilika Lake.

A fourth-century legend, often told to explain the birth of Chilika, states that the pirate king, Raktabahu, planned to attack Puri with a huge fleet of ships. To avoid detection, he stealthily anchored out of sight, off the mouth to the sea. The deception was revealed by the ships&#x27; refuse floating to the shore, thus warning the town&#x27;s people, who escaped with all their possessions. Raktabahu felt betrayed when he found an abandoned town and directed his fury towards the sea
that had betrayed him. The sea parted to let the army march in, then surged back, drowned the army and formed the present lake.

Archeological excavations discovered seventh-century ship anchors and stone memoirs dedicated to battle heroes at a village named Kanas, about north of Chilika on the banks of Nuna river, which flows into the lake. This gives evidence of a historic naval engagement off the coast.

A 10th-century text, the Brahmanda Purana, mentions Chilika Lake as an important centre of trade and commerce, and a shelter for ships sailing to Java, Malaya, Singhala, China and other countries. This suggests that the lake was then deep enough for berthing seagoing ships and had a channel to the sea big enough for loaded trading ships embarking to Southeast Asia. The villagers around Chilika Lake still observe an annual festival called &quot;Bali Yatra&quot; (Journey to Bali).

In 1803, the British entered the shores of the lake, reached Puri and occupied Odisha with the help of Fateh Muhammed. Fateh Muhammed, in turn, was rewarded by the British with freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, of the present day Garh Krishnaprasad revenue block.

Over the years, poets including Kabibar Radhanath Ray and Pandit Godavarish Mishra, freedom fighters and Saints have extolled historicity of the lake as pertinent to its cultural, spiritual, religious and scenic aspects.
&quot;Gopabandhu Das, a famous Odiya poet, became impatient to see the beauty of the march of colorful sights and sounds of Chilika lagoon while going by train. He asked the speeding train to stop for a moment so that he could enjoy the beauty. It is because of the beauty that arrests him much&quot;.
==Geology==
The lake is of estuarine character in an ephemeral environment. Geological studies indicate that the coastline extended along the western shores of the lake in the Pleistocene era with its northeastern region lying under the sea. That the coastline has moved eastward over the ages is supported by the fact that the nearby Konark Sun Temple, built originally on the seashore a few hundred years ago, is now about , away from the coast.

The catchment area of Chilika lake has a rock, sand and mud substratum. It contains a wide range of sedimentary particles such as clay, silt, sand, gravel and shell banks but the major part of the catchment area is silt. Around 1.6 million metric tons per year of sediment is deposited in Chilika lake by rivers Daya and several streams.

It is conjectured that a rise in worldwide sea levels over the last 6,000–8,000 years occurred with a pause in the rise of sea level about 7,000 years ago, which could have resulted in the formation of a sandy beach near the coast at the Southern sector. With the rise in the sea level, the sand beach grew gradually, progressed seaward to the northeast and formed the spit of Chilika. A fossil unearthed from the southwestern edge of the spit indicates that the lake was formed about 3,500–4,000 years ago. The abrupt change in the direction of the coast north of the lake, strong winds shifting sand to the shore, longshore drift (littoral drift), the presence or absence of strong river and tidal currents in different areas are the reasons attributed for the growth of the spit.

White bands of coral in the southern sector, at a height of , above the present water level, shows that the area was once marine and that the water was much deeper than present. The chronological development of the outer barrier spit of the lake has been dated by Optically stimulated luminescence studies of minerals. This was done on sixteen samples of the lake bed. The studies indicated doses of between 153 ± 3 mGy and 2.23 ± 0.07 Gy, corresponding to ages from 40 years at the top of the spit to 300 years at the bottom. The youngest ages are consistent with the age of the overlying vegetation. A clearly defined period of &gt; of barrier construction 40 years ago is identified. Prior to that the deposition rate was relatively constant for 300 years.&#x27;&quot;

==Geography and topography==



Chilika Lake is a shallow bar-built estuary with large areas of mudflats. The western and southern margins of the lake are fringed by the Eastern Ghats hill range.

Several inland rivers, which bring silt into the lake, control the northern end of the lake. A long barrier beach called Rejhansa, formed by northerly currents in the Bay of Bengal, resulted in the formation of this shallow lake and forms its eastern side. As an ephemeral lake, its water surface area varies from in the summer monsoon season to in the winter dry season.

The water spread area of the lagoon ranges between during the monsoon and summer respectively. A long, narrow, outer channel connects the lagoon to the Bay of Bengal, near the village Motto. More recently a new mouth has been opened by Chilika Development Authority (CDA) which has brought a new lease of life to the lagoon.

The lake has numerous islands. The larger islands, separated by shallow channels, lie between the barrier and the main body of the lake. A total of channels connect the lake with Bay of Bengal. The six major islands are &quot;Parikud, Phulbari, Berahpura, Nuapara, Nalbana,&quot; and &quot;Tampara&quot;. These islands, together with the &quot;Peninsula of Malud&quot;, constitute the &quot;Krishnaprasad Revenue Block&quot; of Puri District.

The north shore of the lake is part of Khordha District and the western shore is part of Ganjam District. Due to siltation, the width of the barrier has fluctuated and the mouth to the sea has periodically been closed. The location of the mouth has also frequently shifted, generally towards the northeast. The mouth, which was wide in 1780, was only forty years later. The local fishermen, to maintain their livelihood, had to cut open the mouth to gain access to the sea for fishing.

Water depth of the lake varies from in the dry season to in the rainy season. The width of the old channel to the sea, now reported to be about , is known as Magarmukha (Mouth of the Crocodile). The lake is divided into four separate zones namely, the southern, central, northern sectors and the outer channel area. A long outer channel connects the lake with the Bay of Bengal at Arakhuda village. The lake is pear-shaped and has a maximum length of with a mean width of .

Another lake in India called Vembanad Lake is the longest lake (if the length is considered, where the length of Chilika Lake is ) in India.

==Hydrology==
Three hydrological subsystems control the hydrology of the lake. The land-based system comprises distributaries of the Mahanadi River on the northern side, 52 river channels from the western side and the Bay of Bengal on the eastern side. Two of the three southern branches of the Mahanadi River that trifurcates at Cuttack, feed the lake. 61% () of the total freshwater inflow into the lake is contributed by these two branches.

The second drainage system which is non–perennial accounts for 39% () of the inflow. The important rivers of this drainage system are the Kansari, Kusumi, Janjira, and Tarimi rivers. The annual total surface freshwater input to the lake is estimated to be including direct precipitation over the lake contributing 
All the inland river systems disgorge an annual flow of about of freshwater which is estimated to carry 13 million metric tons of silt into the lake. On the northeast, a channel connects the lake to the Bay of Bengal.

A tropical monsoon climate prevails over the drainage basin area of the lake. The lake experiences South–west and North-east monsoons during June to September and November to December respectively with an average annual rainfall of , with 72 rainy days. The maximum temperature of and minimum temperature of have been recorded.

===Sediment quality===
The Chilika Development Authority (CDA) established an organized system of water quality measurements and limnological investigations indicating the following physico–chemical characteristics of the lake waters.
* Lake water is alkaline – pH ranging from 7.1 – 9.6 with total alkalinity matching the salinity. The southern part of the lake near Rambha has recorded the highest alkalinity.
* Bathymetry survey indicates extreme shallow depths in the northern sector, with less than in a large area. The southern sector of the lake has recorded the maximum depth of 
* High turbidity due to strong mixing of overlying water with sediments is confirmed by observed transparency values ranging between .
* Salinity levels in the lake show wide temporal and spatial variation due to a complex blend of freshwater discharge, evaporation, wind condition and tidal inflow of seawater. The brackish nature of the lake is depicted by the 0 parts per thousand near the Daya River mouth to hyper-saline level of 42 ppt in the outlet channel during the dry period.
* The dissolved oxygen values were between 3.3–18.9 mg/L.
* Phosphate phosphorus (0–0.4 ppm), nitrate nitrogen (10–60 ppm) and silicates (1–8 ppm) are high in the north and northwest part of the lake where most of the rivers discharge into the lake with large amounts of silt and nutrients.
* The lake is broadly divided into four zones on the basis of salinity values, namely the southern, central, northern and outer channel. Tidal influx of seawater during monsoon is arrested by the strong influx of a large amount of fresh water from the northern and central zones. Brackish water conditions in the southern zone, even during monsoon, prevail due to low water exchange. Salinity in the southern zone decreases during the post-monsoon period and in winter as northern winds facilitate mixing of water with rest of the lake. During the summer, intrusion of salt water from the outer channel into the lake increases since water level of the lake is at its lowest level. A general increase in salinity of the central and northern zones occurs due to wind-induced mixing by the predominantly southern winds and salinity in the southern zone does not rise appreciably.

===Sedimentation===
Adverse tidal exchange occurred due to the littoral drift along the coast line causing flow reduction and shifting of the lake mouth every year. Estimated sediment transport due to this is on the order of 100,000 metric tons. This adverse effect needed ameliorative actions.

Sediment cores were collected from different locations of the lake. The result indicated spatial variation of sedimentation rate in three zones of the lake of /year (Northern Sector), /year (Central Sector) and /year (Southern Sector). The non–uniform sedimentation rate along with the porosity and water content of the sediment cores were also analysed which indicated the lake had different deposition zones, with comparatively higher sedimentation rate in Northern and Central Sector and a slow rate in the Southern Sector.

==Conservation – threats and management==
In 1971, during Indira Gandhi&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister of India, Chilika Lake was designated the first Indian wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention due to its rich biodiversity as shown by the facts that:
* Over a million migratory waterfowl and shorebirds winter here.
* Over 400 vertebrate species have been recorded.
* As an estuarine lagoon, it supports a unique assemblage of marine, brackish and freshwater species.
* Several rare and endangered species are found in the region.
* The lake supports fisheries that are the lifeline of the community.
* The lake is of great value in preserving genetic diversity.
* There is an Increase in weeds and aquaculture activities.

===Threats===
Over the years, the ecosystem of the lake encountered several problems and threats such as:
* Siltation due to littoral drift and sediments from the inland river systems
* Shrinkage of water surface area
* Choking of the inlet channel as well as shifting of the mouth connecting to the sea
* Decrease in salinity and fishery resources
* Proliferation of freshwater invasive species and
* An overall loss of biodiversity with decline in productivity adversely affecting the livelihood of the community that depended on it
* Fights between fishermen and non-fishermen communities about fishing rights in the lake and consequent court cases
The expansion of commercial aquaculture of prawn has contributed to the decline of the lakes fisheries and bird population.

Concerted action was initiated by the Odisha State Government with support from the Government of India to adopt adaptive conservation and management actions.

By 1993, the problems in Chilika were severe that the lake was put under &quot;The Montreux Record&quot; as the lake was considered to have &quot;undergone, to be undergoing, or to be likely to undergo change in its ecological character brought about by human action&quot;. The purpose was to stimulate remedial measures for the lake&#x27;s conservation, supplemented with adequate monitoring. It was expected that such an action would benefit from the advice from Ramsar Advisory Mission and other identified technical assistance programs.

In summary, siltation from upstream led to shrinkage of the water surface area, decrease of salinity and growth of invasive freshwater aquatic weed infestation, all of which had a negative impact on the habitat of wildlife and fishery resources.

===Chilika Development Authority (CDA)===
In 1992, the Government of Odisha, concerned by the degradation of the lake&#x27;s ecosystem and cognizant of significant numbers of people who were dependent upon the lake&#x27;s resources, set up the CDA. The CDA was set up for restoration and overall development of the lake under the Indian Societies Registration Act as a parastatal body under the administrative jurisdiction of the Forest and Environment Department, with the following charter:
* To protect the Lake ecosystem with all its genetic diversity
* To formulate the management plan for Integrated Resource Management and wise use of the lake&#x27;s resources by the community depending on it
* To execute multidimensional and multidisciplinary developmental activities either itself or through other agencies
* To collaborate with various national and international institutions for development of the lake

The governing body of the Authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Odisha State and has people&#x27;s representatives (Members of Parliament and Legislative Assembly), representatives of the fisherfolk communities and secretaries of the key departments, experts and eminent scientists as its members.

In 1998, an executive committee constituted with financial authority, supplemented with financial support from the Tenth and Eleventh Finance Commissions of the Government of India, gave support to the management initiatives taken up by CDA. This facilitated a coordinated approach to plan and implement effective ameliorative management actions.

An Integrated Management Plan was implemented with financial support of Rs 570 million (US$12.7 million) out of &quot;special problem grants&quot; recommended by the Finance Commissions. Hydrobiological monitoring was supported under the Odisha Water Resources Consolidation Project of the World Bank, to the extent of Rs 10 million (US$220,000). A strong support network was created with 7 state government organizations, 33 NGOs, 3 national government ministries, 6 other organizations, 11 international organizations, 13 research institutions and 55 different categories of community groups.

In 2003, a collaboration of Indian and Japanese experts led to a friendly relationship between Chilika lake and Saroma Lake in Japan called &quot;Sister Wetlands&quot;.

===Ameliorative actions===
Considering the threats faced by the lake, the national wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs committee of the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests, Government of India, also identified the lake as a priority site for conservation and management. The ameliorative actions were taken by the CDA to restore the ecosystem and to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities living around the lake and on its islands involved the following.

* Opening the lake mouth
The effective ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention of opening the new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura. This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system. This intervention was undertaken after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a model prototype, were carried out by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out. These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake&#x27;s fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds. The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by . Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity.

Other measures included:
* Catchments management in &quot;participatory micro-watershed management in a whole ecosystem approach&quot;.
* Protection of bird habitat and of bird species.
* Economic incentives to the local population to stop poaching of birds.
* Measures to improve the socio–economic conditions, such as training programmes to develop eco-tourism.
* Provision of solar streetlight systems to island villages.
* Development of a ferry service for isolated villages.
* Construction of landing facilities for fisherfolk, as well as education and environmental awareness activities.

In 2002, Chilika was taken out of the Montreux Record, in light of the improved conditions of the lake. Chilika lake is the first Ramsar site in Asia to be
removed from the Montreux record.

===Awards===
* In November 2002, the Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award was presented to the Chilika Development Authority for &quot;outstanding achievements in the field of restoration and wise use of wetlands and effective participation of local communities in these activities&quot;.
* The Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puruskar, constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India awarded the prestigious Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Award–2002 to the Chilika Development Authority for the outstanding contribution of conservation and restoration of the Chilika lake eco-system.

==Flora and fauna==

The ecological richness of the lake is of value in preserving the genetic diversity because of the multiplicity of its habitat, flora and fauna (see photo gallery). The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) surveyed the lake between 1985 and 1988 and identified 800 animal species, including many rare, endangered and vulnerable species, but excluding terrestrial insects.

The threatened animal species identified are green sea turtle (EN), dugong (VU), Irrawaddy dolphin (EN), blackbuck (NT), Spoon billed sandpiper (CR), Chilika limbless skink (CR) and fishing cat (VU). 24 mammalian species were reported. 37 species of reptiles and amphibians are also reported.

===Flora===
Recent surveys revealed 726 species of flowering plants belonging to 496 genera and 120 families. This represents about one fourth of the vascular plant species of the Odisha state where some 2900 species altogether are found.
The flora is dominated by aquatic and sub-aquatic plants with Fabaceae as the dominant plant family followed by Poaceae and Cyperaceae. Certain species were found to be characteristic of specific islands.
Important species identified are:
* Leguminosae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae
* Endemic &quot;Cassipourea ceylanica&quot;
* Five species of seagrass
* Wild plants of horticultural importance and interesting plant groups such as insectivorous plants, epiphytes, parasites and lithophytes
* Mangrove associates, such as &quot;Aegiceras corniculatus&quot;, &quot;Excoecaria agalloch&quot;, &quot;Salvadora persica&quot;, &quot;Pongamia pinnata&quot;, &quot;Colubrina asiatica&quot;, &quot;Capparis roxburghii&quot;, &quot;Macrotyloma ciliatum&quot; and many others.

===Fauna===

Chilika Lake is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds, on the Indian sub-continent. The lake is home to a number of threatened species of plants and animals. It is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the country. Some species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened animals inhabit the lake for at least part of their life cycle.

The lagoon hosts over 160 species of birds in the peak migratory season. Birds from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea and other remote parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Kazakhstan, Central and southeast Asia, Ladakh and Himalayas come here. These birds travel great distances; some of them possibly travel as much as to reach Chilika Lake.

Birds like White bellied sea eagles, greylag geese, purple moorhen, jacana, flamingos, egrets, grey and purple heron, Indian roller, storks, white ibis, spoonbills, brahminy ducks, shovellers, pintails, and more are found here.

Migratory waterfowl arrive here from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake and remote parts of Russia, Mongolia, Ladakh, Siberia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and from the Himalayas. A census conducted in the winter of 1997-98 recorded about 2 million birds in the lake.

According to a survey, 45 percent of the birds are terrestrial in nature, 32 percent are waterfowl, and 23 percent are waders. The lagoon is also home to 14 types of raptors. Around 152 rare and endangered Irrawaddy dolphins have also been reported. Plus, the lagoon supports about 37 species of reptiles and amphibians.

In 2007, nearly 840,000 birds visited the lake, out of which 198,000 were spotted in Nalbana Island. On 5 Jan 2008, a bird census involving 85 wildlife officials counted 900,000 birds of which 450,000 were sighted in Nalabana. Removal of invasive species of freshwater aquatic plants, especially water hyacinth, due to restoration of salinity, is a contributing factor for the recent increasing attraction of birds to the lake.

;Nalbana Bird Sanctuary

Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of Chilika Lake. Nalbana means &quot;a weed-covered island&quot; In the Odia language. It is a major island in the center of the lake and has an area of . The island gets submerged during the monsoon season. As the monsoon recedes in the winter, lake levels decrease and the island is exposed, birds flock to the island in large numbers to feed on its extensive mudflats. Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection Act.

===Aqua fauna===
As per the Chilika Development Authority&#x27;s (CDA) updated data (2002), 323 aquatic species, which includes 261 fish species, 28 prawns and 34 crabs are reported out of which sixty five species breed in the lake. 27 species are freshwater fishes and two genera of prawns. The remaining species migrate to the sea to breed. 21 species of herrings and sardines of the family Clupeidae are reported.

Microalgae, marine seaweeds, sea grasses, fish and crab also flourish in the brackish water of the Chilika Lagoon. Recovery of seagrass beds in recent years is a welcoming trend which may eventually result in re-colonization of endangered dugongs.

Between 1998–2002, 40 fish species were recorded here for the first time and following the reopening of the lake mouth in 2000, six threatened species have reappeared, including:
* Milk fish (Seba khainga),
* Indo-Pacific tarpon (Panialehio),
* Ten pounder (Nahama),
* Bream (Kala khuranti),
* Hilsa (Tenuealosa) ilisha (ilishi) and
* Mullet &quot;R. corsula&quot; (Kekenda)
;Commercial fisheries
The lake is an ecosystem with large fishery resources. It sustains more than 150,000 fisher–folk living in 132 villages on the shore and islands. For centuries fisher folk evolved exclusive rights of fishing through a complex system of partitioning the fisheries of the lake and developed a range of fishing techniques, nets and gear.

During the British rule, in 1897–98, fishermen community enjoyed exclusive fisheries rights in the lake. The fisheries of the lake were part of the Zamindari estates of Khallikote, Parikud, Suna Bibi, Mirza Taher Baig and the Chaudhary families of Bhungarpur and the Khas Mahal areas of Khurda, lying within the kingdoms of the Rajas of Parikud and Khallikote. The zamindars (Landlords) leased out the fisheries exclusively to the local fisherfolk.

With the abolition of zamindari (land lordship) system in 1953, traditional fishing areas continued to be leased out to cooperatives of local fishermen. Fishing, particularly, prawn fishing, became remunerative with outside interest playing an important role. But in 1991, when the government of Odisha proposed a leasing policy that would have resulted in the auction of leases to the highest bidder, the Fishermen&#x27;s cooperatives challenged the order in court. The High Court of Odisha ordered the Government to enact changes that would protect the interests of traditional fishermen and since then no new leases have been reported. This has resulted in a chaotic regime in which powerful vested interests from outside dominate, and the local people have been subordinated.

Butter catfish and &quot;Wallago attu&quot; are the most common type of fish found in the lake. 11 species of fish, 5 species of prawn and 2 crab species are commercially important. The commercially important prawn are giant tiger prawn (&quot;Metapenaeus monoceros&quot;), Indian prawn (&quot;Penaeus indicus&quot;), &quot;Metapenaeus monoceros&quot; (Speckled shrimp), &quot;Metapenaeus affinis&quot; (Pink prawn) and &quot;Metapenaeus dobson&quot; (Kadal shrimp). Mangrove crab is an important commercial crab. Fish landings in the lake, which fluctuated in the past, have recorded a remarkable recovery after the opening of the new mouth and dredging of silt –choked old mouth Magarmukh in 2000–2001, resulted in a better intermixing of the tidal influx from the sea and freshwater inflow from rivers. Against an all time lowest landing of fish and prawn of in 1995–96, the all-time high is reported to be during 2001–2002 resulting in an estimated per capita income for the fisher folk of Rs 19,575 (about US$392) during the year. Recently, the Government of Odisha have issued a notification banning the lease of Chilika Lake for Culture Fishery.

;Dolphins

The Irrawaddy dolphin (&quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;) is the flagship species of Chilika lake. Chilika is home to the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in India and one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to this species.

It is classified as Endangered according to International Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN).

A small population of Bottlenose dolphins, also migrate into the lagoon from the sea. Chilika fishermen state that when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake.

Some Irrawaddy dolphins used to be sighted only along the inlet channel and in a limited portion of the central sector of the lake. After the opening of the new mouth at Satapada in 2000, they are now well distributed in the central and the southern sector of the lake. The number of dolphins sighted has varied from 50 to 170. A 2006 census counted 131 dolphins and the 2007 census revealed 138 dolphins. Out of the 138 dolphins, 115 were adults, 17 adolescents and six calves. 60 adults were spotted in the outer channel followed by 32 in the central sector and 23 in the southern sector.

Dolphin tourism provides an important alternative source of income for many local residents. There are four tourist associations in Satapada employing three hundred and sixty 9-HP long-tail motor boats taking tourists to a area of the lake for dolphin watching. About 500 fishing families are involved in this business. The Odisha Tourism Department and the Dolphin Motorboat Association, an NGO at Satpada, report about 40,000 tourists visit Chilika every year for dolphin watching. October–January, and May–June are the peak season for tourists at Chilika, with a maximum 600-700 per day during December–January. The Dolphin Motorboat Association has 75 8-passenger motorboats for dolphin watching. Tourists pay Rs. 250 for 60–90 minutes per trip(approx ₹4k for 10 people with 3.5 hours in a private boat in 2018). Besides the Association, the Odisha Tourism Department organises &quot;dolphin-watch&quot; for tourists. Even during monsoon, about 100 tourists/day visit the lake.

Boat based dolphin watching tours impact dolphin behavior and cause several accidental dolphin deaths each year. CDA conducts an annual census of dolphin deaths. They report 15 deaths in 2003–04, 11 in 2004–05, 8 in 2005-06 and 5 in 2006–07. 40% of the 2006-07 deaths were by mechanised boats.

Since 2004, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been conducting a science-based community education project to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins and Chilika Lake. They have determined the primary cause of mortality for this population of dolphins is floating gill nets and hook line fisheries and the secondary cause is boat strikes from increasing unmanaged tourism activities.

The Irrawaddy dolphins have a mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with the traditional fishermen. Fishermen recall when they would call out to the dolphins, to drive fish into their nets. Castnet fishing with the help of Irrawaddy dolphins in upper reaches of the Ayeyawady River has been documented.

==Major attractions==
The 15 km2 Nalaban Island is within the Lagoon and is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands. It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973. It is the heart of the park where one can see thousands of birds descending during the migratory season. The island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation, and post-monsoon, the island emerges again.

The lake harbours 225 species of fish, a variety of phytoplankton, algae and aquatic plants, and also supports over 350 species of non-aquatic plants. The other areas where high concentrations of birds are recorded are Gerasara, Parikud Island, and the western shores of the northern sector.

==Eco-tourism==
The open air and scenic natural flora and fauna of the lake are an attraction for eco-tourism. This is expected to provide a degree of alternate employment to the local community and generate environmental awareness, among local residents as well as visitors, about the conservation and wise use of the lake&#x27;s natural resources. The locations within the lake identified for such activity are:
* Rambha Bay at the southern end of the lake with the group of islands including:
** The Becon Island, with an architectural conical pillar (to put a light on the top) built by Mr. Snodgrass, the then collector of Ganjam of the East India Company, on a mass of rock in the Rambha Bay near Ghantasila hill. It has scenic water spread surrounded by the Eastern Ghat.
** The Breakfast Island, pear-shaped, known as &quot;Sankuda island&quot;, with remnants of a dilapidated bungalow constructed by the King of Kalikote, has rare plants and is full of greenery with appealing flora.
** Honeymoon Island, from Rambha Jetty, known as Barkuda Island, with clear waters has abundant red and green macro algae in the bed is also known for the limbless lizard, an endemic species found here.
* Somolo and Dumkudi islands, located in the Central and Southern sectors of the lake, in the backdrop of scenic Khalikote hill range, are inundated remnants of the Eastern Ghats with rich flora and fauna and also known for sighting of Irrawaddy dolphins.
* Birds&#x27; island, located in the southern sector of the lake has huge exposed hanging rocks, are painted white due to folic acid of the droppings of the birds and is known for rich algal communities and few mangrove species and also migratory birds in winter.
* Parikud is a group of composite islands in the Garh Krishnaprasad Block for nature lovers and provides an avian spectacle during winter season
* Kalijai Temple located on an island is considered to be the abode of the Goddess Kalijai. This temple is located at a hill which is surrounded by blue water bears. Local people of Chilika refer to goddess as the reigning deity of the lagoon
* Satapada village, at the new mouth of the lake, provides a view of the Lake and also views of the dolphins. Hundreds of boats here provide tours of the lake for tourists.
* Barunkuda, a small island situated near Magarmukh, the mouth of the lake, has a temple of Lord Varuna.
* Nabagraha is an ancient deity located along the outer channel.
* Chourbar Shiva Temple is located near Alupatna village, along the outer channel.
* Manikapatna, located on the outer channel has historical evidence of a port which was used for trade with Far East and also has the Bhabakundeswar temple of Lord Shiva, an old Mosque whose entrance door is made of the jaws of the whale.
* Sand-Bar and Mouth of the Lake is a striking and un-explored stretch of of empty beach across the sand bar which separates the Lake from the sea.
* Mangalajodi a famous bird sanctuary for sighting migratory birds.

===Film===
Akanksha Damini Joshi&#x27;s film, Chilika Bank$ (2008) tells the story via a banyan tree on the banks of lake Chilika tracing the ecological changes in the lake over four decades. From 1970s, when it was exposed to poaching by the outsiders, through 1980s when the lake was over-fished, to 1990s when the aqua culture ponds became a common sight, and finally the first decade of the 21st century when the environmental interference that was made to protect the lake ended up becoming its greatest threat.

Joshi&#x27;s film maps the destruction of the lake and its abuse for the past four decades. The locals have been looted of their life support system with migration now being their only recourse. The film provides account of how uncontrolled human intervention has turned the lake, which was a sustainable livelihood resource, into a mere waterbody that tourists can dip their feet into.

The film produced by Public Service Broadcasting Trust was honored with the Livelihood Award at the CMS Vatavaran Environment and Wildlife Film Festival, New Delhi in 2009. It was recipient of the First Prize at , South Asia Documentary Film Festival. Chilika Bank$ was screened in the Indian Panorama section of the 40th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa 2009 in the non-feature film category. The film has garnered multiple television screenings on India&#x27;s public broadcaster, Doordarshan&#x27;s various channels.

The film was an Official Selection at the Film South Asia, Kathmandu in 2009, the Rodos EcoFilms International Festival,Greece in 2010 and the 4th Samsung Women&#x27;s International Film Festival, Chennai in 2011.

Chilika Banks is displayed in various renowned university libraries like the Harvard University, Washington University, Duke University, Emory University and Syracuse University; and the Library of Congress, de facto the National Library of United States of America.

<doc id="1142871" wikidata="Q25473" url="?curid=1142871" title="Queen Charlotte Sound / Tōtaranui">
<text>Queen Charlotte Sound / Tōtaranui is the easternmost of the main sounds of the Marlborough Sounds, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Its original Māori name is after the local tōtara trees.

In 2014, the sound was given the official name of Queen Charlotte Sound / Tōtaranui as part of a Waitangi Tribunal settlement with the Te Āti Awa tribe.

==Geography==
Like the majority of its neighbours, the sound runs southwest to northeast before joining Cook Strait, which separates the North Island and South Island of New Zealand.

To the east of the sound lie Arapaoa Island and Tory Channel. Interisland ferries use Tory Channel and Queen Charlotte Sound on their journeys between Picton and Wellington in the North Island.

Kenepuru Sound, an arm of Pelorus Sound, lies to the northwest and runs parallel to Queen Charlotte Sound. Some of the small side arms of the two sounds are only hundreds of metres apart, but are separated by a steep serrated range of hills. Not surprisingly, one of the settlements on this stretch of coast is called Portage, named for the simplest method of passing between the two sounds.

The sound is a drowned river valley (or ria).

==Towns and settlements==
The town of Picton, the northern terminus of the South Island&#x27;s railway and state highway networks, lies near the head of the sound.

Other settlements are small and isolated—often simply individual properties. Due to the rugged nature of the coast, for many of these access is by boat only.

==History==
During pre-European and early contact periods, Queen Charlotte Sound was important location for trade between North and South Island Māori, including pakohe (argillite stone) from nearby D&#x27;Urville Island, which was used to create toki (adzes). The local population gathered around the waters for its bountiful seafood.

It was from a hill on Arapaoa Island in 1770 that Captain James Cook first saw the sea passage from the Pacific Ocean to the Tasman Sea, which was named Cook Strait. Captain Cook sheltered in Queen Charlotte Sound during each of his three voyages of exploration at various points, and named it after Queen Consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

The area was a base for whaling throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, notably at Perano Head on Arapaoa Island.

Queen Charlotte Sound has calm water and is popular for sailing - a marked contrast to the notorious waters of Cook Strait. Many ships have been wrecked close to the entrance to the Sound, most notably in recent years the Russian cruise liner &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot;, which sank in 1986 in Port Gore after striking rocks. One life was lost in the incident.

<doc id="1142909" wikidata="Q5583775" url="?curid=1142909" title="Goofer dust">
<text>Goofer dust is a traditional ing material and practice of the Black American tradition of Hoodoo from the Southern United States. It has roots in traditional Kongo religion.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;goofer&quot; in goofer dust has Kongo origins and comes from the Kikongo word &quot;Kufwa&quot; which means &quot;to die.&quot; Among older Hoodoo practitioners, this derivation is very clear, because &quot;Goofer&quot; is not only used as an adjective modifying &quot;dust&quot; but also a verb (&quot;He goofered that man&quot;) and a noun (&quot;She put a goofer on him&quot;). As late as the 1930s, goofering was a regional synonym for hoodooing, and in North Carolina at least, the meaning of the term was broadened beyond spells of damage, illness, and death to include love spells cast with dominating intent.

A euphemistic word for goofering is &quot;poisoning,&quot; which in this context does not refer to a physical poison but to a physical that, through magical means, brings about an &quot;unnatural illness&quot; or the death of the victim. Even more euphemistic is the special use of the verb &quot;hurt,&quot; which is often defined as &quot;to poison,&quot; with the tacit understanding that &quot;to poison&quot; really means &quot;to goofer.&quot; The more general verbs &quot;fix&quot; (meaning to prepare a spell) and &quot;trick&quot; (meaning to cast a spell) are also applied to goofering.

==Description==
It can generally refer to any powder used to cast a spell, especially if harmful in nature, but specifically refers to a concoction of natural ingredients that can be used to cause harm, trouble or even an enemy. Some historical sources, such as some of the interviews conducted by Harry M. Hyatt, indicate goofer dust can be synonymous with graveyard dirt.

==Use==
In practice, it was often used to create illness in victims, such as swelling of the legs or blindness. Recipes for making it vary, but primarily include graveyard dirt and snakeskin. Other ingredients may include ash, powdered sulfur, salt, powdered bones, powdered insect chitin, dried manure, herbs, spices and &quot;anvil dust&quot; — the fine black iron detritus found around a blacksmith&#x27;s anvil. On page 162 of his autobiography Dr. John / Mac Rebennack wrote: &quot;Goofer dust is a combination of dirt from a graveyard, gunpowder, and grease from them (St. Roch Cemetery, New Orleans) bells.&quot; The result usually varies in color from &quot;a fine yellowish-grey&quot; to deep &quot;black dust&quot; depending on the formula, and it may be mixed with local dirt to conceal its deployment.

In the modern day, formulations may be thought to include anything harmful that can come to hand. For example, insecticide powders might be mixed with expired medications, dried medical waste, etc. Regardless of any intended magical effects, synergies between the ingredients might cause real medical harm.

It is sometimes used in love spells of a coercive nature, the severity of which range from the goofer dust being used to provoke helpful spirits to coax the target into love, to the more extreme &quot;love me or die&quot; spells. Rarely, it has been used in gambling spells.

Goofer Dust has also been used as a protection spell. By using graveyard dirt from a loved one of the practitioner, along with salt and pepper and other ingredients, the normally offensive functions of Goofer Dust become protective functions.

==In popular culture==
In the 1954 Cold War classic &quot;Night People&quot;, Col. Steve Van Dyke (Gregory Peck) spiked a bottle of absinthe with a packet of goofer dust. &quot;The X-Files&quot;, in Episode 14 of season 7 (&quot;Theef&quot;), referenced the use of goofer dust by the vengeful father of a woman who died due to poor hospital care. Goofer dust was referenced to protect against hellhounds in the television show &quot;Supernatural,&quot; Season 2, episode 8 &quot;Crossroad Blues&quot; in Season 8, episode 14 &quot;Trial and Error&quot;, and in Season 12, episode 15 &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot;.

In the song &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Night&quot; on the &quot;Voodoo&quot; album, King Diamond sings that the character Salem uses graveyard dust (referred to as goofer dust) to send the spirits of dead people into Sarah&#x27;s head.

Goofer dust is referenced in the more popular series of short films &quot;Scary or Die&quot; in which a grandfather with a family history of dabbling in voodoo and the occult blows &quot;Golfer dust&quot; or as she describes to the watcher, &quot;The ash of her loved ones; in which she says that the grandfather told her that if she felt love in her heart it would &quot;Never die&quot; and therefore hexes her to come back as the undead&quot;.

Goofer dust is mentioned in the Willie Mabon blues song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. It was also used in the song &quot;I Got My Mojo Workin&quot;. In &quot;Treemonisha&quot; by Scott Joplin, Zodzetrick refers to himself as the goofer dus&#x27; man and &#x27;King of Goofer Dus&#x27; Land&#x27;. Lil Johnson recorded a song called &quot;Goofer Dust Swing&quot; in 1937. Michael Ondaatje refers to goofer dust on page three of &quot;Coming Through Slaughter&quot;. Colson Whitehead&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;The Underground Railroad&quot; speaks of a slaveowner hiring a witch to &quot;goofer his property&quot; to prevent anyone from escaping.

In FXX&#x27;s 2022 original series &quot;Little Demon&quot;, Laura and Darlene get trapped in a hidden pocket realm Laura uses as a junkyard on their Girls&#x27; Night. In the pocket, there are goofer dust gusts (in the form of a dust devil) that Laura tries to infiltrate in order to obtain 5 mg of goofer dust for a bomb. The girls use the goofer dust bomb to blow a hole through the pocket realm back to their plane of Earth. 

On their 2023 album &quot;Quaker City Quiet Pills&quot;, punk rock band The Dead Milkmen included a track called &quot;Hen’s Teeth and Goofa Dust&quot;.

<text>Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay is located at the northeast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, to the south of the Marlborough Sounds and north of Clifford Bay. In August 2014, the name Cloudy Bay, given by Captain Cook in 1770, was officially altered to Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay, with the Māori name recalling the early explorer Kupe scooping up oysters from the bay.
The area lends its name to one of the best known New World white wines (Cloudy Bay Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc) although the grapes used in production of that wine are grown in the Marlborough wine region further inland.

==Features==

The bay faces Cook Strait, stretching north–south over a distance of from the southern extremity of the Marlborough Sounds (Port Underwood) to White Bluffs. Along its length is the delta of the Wairau River, which reaches the sea at two points. The southern of these forms an entrance to the Big Lagoon, just to the north of White Bluffs. The central point is known as the Wairau Diversion. There is also a swimming beach to the north known as Whites Bay.

Fifteen minutes drive from central Blenheim is the coastal community of Rārangi which consists of an original beachfront settlement in the northern end of Cloudy Bay which ranges from the typical New Zealand bach or crib along with some high quality homes. It also has a newer large subdivision within the central part of Cloudy Bay nearer to the coastal man-made river which is known as the Wairau Diversion.

==History==
Archaeological excavations at Wairau Bar indicate that Māori were living there in the &#x27;moa-hunter&#x27; period about 1288 to 1300 for a period of about 20 years. This is the oldest and best researched site of early Polynesian settlement in New Zealand. Cloudy Bay was named by Captain James Cook on 7 February 1770. Sealers first visited about 1826 and set up stations at Port Underwood, the deep inlet at the north of the bay. They were followed by whalers with John Guard setting up a whaling station at Port Underwood in 1828 with his ship &quot;Waterloo&quot;. By 1840 there were approximately 150 Europeans in the area, probably the largest concentration in the South Island at that time. Between 1829 and 1832, &quot;Waterloo&quot; made three return trips to Sydney per year selling seal skins, flax and whale oil and returning with supplies and trade goods. In 1832 Guard installed Capt Hall as a new master in the Waterloo. On 17 June 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed by South Island chiefs at Horahora-Kakahu Island, just off-shore from Port Underwood. It was being transported around the New Zealand coast on HMS &quot;Herald&quot;.

<doc id="1142932" wikidata="Q7984071" url="?curid=1142932" title="Wesleyan University Philippines">
<text>Wesleyan University-Philippines (WU-P) is a private, Protestant, sectarian, and non-profit higher education institution run by the United Methodist Church (UMC) in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, Philippines. It was founded in 1946 as the Philippine Wesleyan College. It is named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. The university offers preschool, grade school, high school undergraduate, and graduate programs. It also initiated the Support for the Handicapped and their Rehabilitation through Education (SHARE) Program, the first school in Central Luzon to integrate hearing-impaired students into mainstream classes.

The university was granted autonomy status by the Commission on Higher Education effective March 11, 2009 – present

==History==
The university was conceived by a group of Filipino and American Methodists led by the late Rev. Carlos Mañacop Sr. as part of the realization of their ecclesiastic mission. It was founded on July 1, 1946, and was named Philippine Wesleyan College. It was incorporated on April 28, 1948. The institution was named in memory of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It started operating in &quot;sawali&quot; and wooden structure erected on an 800-square meter lot at the corner of Quimzon and Mabini Streets in Cabanatuan, with its first set of 19 faculty and staff and batch of 368 students enrolled in Liberal Arts, Education, Elementary and High School programs.  The university was granted government recognition on June 26, 1947, and incorporated on April 28, 1948.

The institution attained its University Status on April 24, 1978, and has since carried the name Wesleyan University-Philippines. Since its elevation to university status, it has grown in terms of academic programs, student enrolment, physical plant and facilities, faculty and staff, research and extension and other support services. It has also expanded its operations. Today, it operates in two campuses, Cabanatuan or the Cushman Campus, and Maria Aurora.

Eleven administrators took turns in steering the growth of Wesleyan University-Philippines. Each contributed in bringing the university to its present glorious status, an esteemed educational landmark in the region. The first president of the institution was Dr. Dionisio D. Alejandro (1946–1947), the first Filipino Bishop of the United Methodist Church of the Philippines. He was succeeded by Rev. Carlos Mañacop Sr. (1947–1952); followed by Dr. Roxy Lefforge (1952–1954); then Dr. Asuncion A. Perez (1954–1967), the first female cabinet member who served as a Social Welfare Administrator under four Philippine presidents. She was followed by Dr. Fidel F. Galang (1967–1970)

In 1970, Dr. Gloria D. Lacson, a former dean of the Mary Johnston College of Nursing was elected as the 6th College president. She served for twenty-four years and was eventually the first university president in 1978 when the institution was granted its university status. During her term, nine new programs were offered and the Information and Development Desk was created which later became the Research and Development Office. It was also under her leadership that the university had enormous improvements in terms of facilities as seen in the construction of several buildings which now house the different academic programs of the university.

Dr. Emmanuel G. Cleto, a former Commissioner of the Civil Service Commission, was appointed president from 1995 to 2000. Two new programs were added in the degree offerings of the university. The four-storey Alejandrino Hall which houses the College of Computer Studies and the three-storey Elementary Building were constructed during his term.

Dr. Zenaida P. Lumba, former president of Harris Memorial College, was elected as the eighth president (2001–2005) and it was during her stewardship that the university attained deregulated status. The Millennium Building was constructed during her term. It now houses the College of Hotel and Tourism Management, Graduate School and Law School. The John Wesley Park which is now the distinct landmark of the university was also constructed.

In 2005, Atty. Guillermo T. Maglaya was elected as the 9th president of the university. During his term, the WUP Cardiovascular Diagnostic Center and Hospital became operational and was dubbed as the Heart Center of the North. It was under his leadership and his vice president for academic affairs, Dr. Anselmo D. Lupdag, that the university was granted a five-year Autonomous Status (2009–2014) by the Commission on Higher Education.

In 2009, Prof. Manuel G. Palomo was elected as the tenth president. He was known for restoration of the Supreme Student Council and implementation of improved salary scheme for faculty and staff. Make-over of the campus physical facilities, refurbishing of buildings, provision of Wi-Fi internet connection and air-conditioned classrooms were accomplished during his tenure. Also, more programs in health sciences were offered thus renaming the College of Nursing as the College of Nursing and Allied Medical Sciences.

In 2012, Hon. Pacifico B. Aniag was elected as the 11th president. He was known for achieving financial stability of the university. Also, five new programs were offered including the Bachelor of Laws. During his term, the university was granted another three years as Autonomous University (2006–2019) by the Commission on Higher Education and Institutional Accreditation by Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP) from September 2014 to April 2018. Two four-storey buildings that replaced the old agricultural building were constructed during his presidency. His graceful exit from office is historic as he was the first president to retire from his post which paved the way for smooth transition of leadership.

On January 24, 2019, Hon. Benjamin D. Turgano, a retired judge and a man of Methodist faith was elected as the 12th president of the university. His election into the University Presidency is historic as he was the first president who was chosen through a search and screening committee.  As a man of law and of God, Hon. Turgano assured the Wesleyan community that under his leadership, no judgment will be rendered unless all sides have been heard. Issues and concerns of different units will be heard through dialogs and collegial discussions. He also emphasized that transparency, efficiency, accountability and continuous improvements will be the standards that will govern the academic and administrative operations and procedures in the university during his presidency.

==Mascot, moniker, and colors==

The image of &quot;Circuit Rider&quot; was chosen as the university mascot to signify the clergymen of the Methodist Church who travel around specific geographic territories to minister to settlers and organize congregations. Wesleyan University-Philippines athletic teams are known as The Riders and wear school colors, Green (Pantone 348) and Yellow (Pantone 7548 C).

== Spiritual life ==
In a United Methodist institution such as Wesleyan University – Philippines, the Chaplain&#x27;s Office is composed of the University Chaplain together with special appointees (ordained clergies and commissioned deaconesses) called together by God and appointed by a bishop to minister outside the walls of the church.

Their ministry of witness and service extends God&#x27;s love and service in various settings and requires specialized training to qualify for endorsement by The United Methodist Church. However, requirements of appointees for institutions such as Wesleyan will be determined by the appropriate institution officials depending on the needs of the institution and submitted to the bishop for proper endorsement. To ensure high standards of competence and uniform standards, the United Methodist Annual Conferences in consultation with the bishop is responsible for enlisting, endorsing, and supporting such workers serving in ministries of specialized settings. The primary difference between these appointments and those to local churches is the nature of the institution and the role of the church workers in relationship to institutions with the primary purpose of providing witness and service of Christ&#x27;s love and justice.

<text>TAP Express (TAP standing for &quot;Transportes Aéreos Portugueses&quot;) is a Portuguese virtual carrier and regional airline brand name for TAP Air Portugal which operates short and medium-haul routes. Its head office is on the grounds of Lisbon Portela Airport in Lisbon. Currently, Portugália Airlines operates under the &quot;TAP Express&quot; brand.

== History ==
On 14 January 2016, TAP Portugal announced that Portugália Airlines, its regional subsidiary, would be rebranded &quot;TAP Express&quot; as of 27 March 2016, as part of the restructuring measures within the group, even though the company still operates as a wholly owned company of TAP Air Portugal. Mainline carriers often use regional airlines to operate services in order to increase frequency, serve routes that would not sustain larger aircraft, or for other competitive reasons.

Also on 14 January 2016, TAP Air Portugal also announced that the entire Portugália fleet consisting of Fokker 100 and Embraer ERJ-145 would be replaced by July 2016 with new Embraer 190 and ATR 72-600 aircraft (the latter operated by White Airways), which received a livery similar to that of TAP Portugal. White Airways, an airline owned by Omni Aviation, operated for TAP Express until 2022.

== Fleet ==

As of January 2025, the TAP Express fleet consists of the following aircraft:

<text>The Carteret ministry was the Whig government of Great Britain that held office from 1742 to 1744, following the defeat of the Walpole ministry by a margin of one vote. The nominal head of the ministry was Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, until his death in 1743. He was succeeded in the role of prime minister by Henry Pelham.

The ministry derives its name from John Carteret, 2nd Baron Carteret. He served as Northern Secretary throughout until his resignation, having been the mainstay of whom the respective prime ministers were dependent for support.

<doc id="1142946" wikidata="Q606092" url="?curid=1142946" title="Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act">
<text>The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA; ) is a Canadian law relating to data privacy. It governs how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial business. In addition, the &quot;Act&quot; contains various provisions to facilitate the use of electronic documents. PIPEDA became law on 13 April 2000 to promote consumer trust in electronic commerce. The act was also intended to reassure the European Union that the Canadian privacy law was adequate to protect the personal information of European citizens. In accordance with section 29 of PIPEDA, Part I of the &quot;Act&quot; (&quot;Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector&quot;) must be reviewed by Parliament every five years. The first Parliamentary review occurred in 2007.

PIPEDA incorporates and makes mandatory provisions of the Canadian Standards Association&#x27;s Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, developed in 1995. However, there are a number of exceptions to the Code where information can be collected, used and disclosed without the consent of the individual. Examples include reasons of national security, international affairs, and emergencies. Under the &quot;Act&quot;, personal information can also be disclosed without knowledge or consent to investigations related to law enforcement, whether federal, provincial or foreign. There are also exceptions to the general rule that an individual shall be given access to his or her personal information. Exceptions may include information that would likely reveal personal information about a third party, information that cannot be disclosed for certain legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons, and information that is subject to solicitor-client privilege.

==Overview==
&quot;Personal Information&quot;, as specified in PIPEDA, is as follows: information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

The &quot;Act&quot; gives individuals the right to
* know why an organization collects, uses, or discloses their personal information;
* expect an organization to collect, use or disclose their personal information reasonably and appropriately, and not use the information for any purpose other than that to which they have consented;
* know who in the organization is responsible for protecting their personal information;
* expect an organization to protect their personal information by taking appropriate security measures;
* expect the personal information an organization holds about them to be accurate, complete, and up-to-date;
* obtain access to their personal information and ask for corrections if necessary; and
* complain about how an organization handles their personal information if they feel their privacy rights have not been respected.

The &quot;Act&quot; requires organizations to
* obtain consent when they collect, use, or disclose their personal information;
* supply an individual with a product or a service even if they refuse consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information unless that information is essential to the transaction;
* collect information by fair and lawful means; and
* have personal information policies that are clear, understandable, and readily available.

==Implementation==
The implementation of PIPEDA occurred in three stages. Starting in 2001, the law applied to federally regulated industries (such as airlines, banking and broadcasting). In 2002, the law was expanded to include the health sector. Finally in 2004, any organization that collects personal information in the course of commercial activity was covered by PIPEDA, except in provinces that have &quot;substantially similar&quot; privacy laws. As of October 2018, seven provinces have privacy laws that have been declared by the federal Governor in Council to be substantially similar to PIPEDA:

* &quot;An Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector&quot; (Quebec)
* &quot;The Personal Information Protection Act&quot; (British Columbia)
* &quot;The Personal Information Protection Act&quot; (Alberta)
* &quot;The Personal Health Information Protection Act&quot; (Ontario), &quot;with respect to health information custodians&quot;
* &quot;The Personal Health Information Privacy and Access Act&quot; (New Brunswick), &quot;with respect to personal health information custodians&quot;
* &quot;The Personal Health Information Act&quot; (Newfoundland and Labrador), &quot;with respect to health information custodians&quot;
* &quot;The Personal Health Information Act&quot; (Nova Scotia), &quot;with respect to health information custodians&quot;
* &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot;

=== &quot;Personal Information Protection Act&quot; (British Columbia) ===
Notable provisions of PIPA:

* Consent must be garnered for the collection of personal information
* Collection of personal information limited to reasonable purposes
* Limits use and disclosure of personal information
* Limits access to personal information
* Stored personal information must be accurate and complete
* Designates the role of the Privacy Officer
* Policies and procedures for breaches of privacy
* Measures for resolution of complaints
* Special rules for employment relationships

=== &quot;Personal Health Information Protection Act&quot; (Ontario) ===

The &quot;Personal Health Information Protection Act&quot;, known by its acronym PHIPA (typically pronounced &#x27;pee-hip-ah&#x27;), established in 2004, outlines privacy regulations for health information custodians in Ontario, Canada. Breaches of PHIPA are directed to the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner.

The &quot;Personal Health Information Protection Act&quot; serves three important functions:

* To govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal health information by health information custodians. 
* To provide patients with a right to request access to and correction of their records of personal health information held by health information custodians. 
* To impose administrative requirements (regulations) on custodians with respect to records of personal health information.

== Amendment ==
On June 18, 2015, the &quot;Digital Privacy Act&quot; (Senate Bill S-4) became law, amending the PIPEDA to include a business transaction exemption, mandatory breach notification requirements, enhanced powers for the Privacy Commissioner, and various other updates.

The PIPEDA sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. PIPEDA also applies to federal works, undertakings, and business in respect of employee personal information. The law gives individuals the right to access and request correction of the personal information these organizations may have collected about them.

In general, PIPEDA applies to organizations&#x27; commercial activities in all provinces, except organizations that collect, use or disclose personal information entirely within provinces that have their own privacy laws, which have been declared substantially similar to the federal law. In such cases, it is the substantially similar provincial law that will apply instead of PIPEDA, although PIPEDA continues to apply to federal works, undertakings or businesses and to interprovincial or international transfers of personal information.

Recently, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, as well as academics and members of civil society, have claimed that it does not address modern challenges of privacy law sufficiently, calling for reforming PIPEDA in view of AI. The Canadian government responded to these calls with a comprehensive reform project currently under Parliamentary discussion. 

== Remedies ==
The &quot;Act&quot; does not create an automatic right to sue for violations of the law&#x27;s obligations. Instead, PIPEDA follows an ombudsman model in which complaints are taken to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. The Commissioner is required to investigate the complaint and to produce a report at its conclusion. The report is not binding on the parties but is more of a recommendation. The Commissioner does not have any powers to order compliance, award damages, or levy penalties. The organization complained about does not have to follow the recommendations. The complainant, with the report in hand, can then take the matter to the Federal Court of Canada. The responding organization cannot take the matter to the courts, because the report is not a decision and PIPEDA does not explicitly grant the responding organization the right to do so.

PIPEDA provides, at section 14, the complainant the right to apply to the Federal Court of Canada for a hearing with respect to the subject matter of the complaint. The Court has the power to order the organization to correct its practices, to publicize the steps it will take to correct its practices, and to award damages.

==Proposed Bill C-475==
As a result of long-enduring and central gap in Canada&#x27;s privacy protections, Bill C-475 was proposed in February 2013 by Charmaine Borg, MP, proposing several amendments to the &quot;Act&quot;. Bill C-475 was defeated in January 2014.

<doc id="1142956" wikidata="Q1101225" url="?curid=1142956" title="Clifford Bay">
<text>Clifford Bay is a bay in the northeast of the South Island of New Zealand, in the Marlborough Region. It lies between Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay to the northwest, and Cape Campbell to the southeast. The bay&#x27;s shoreline is dominated by extensive solar salt extraction works at Lake Grassmere / Kapara Te Hau, close to the southern end of the bay. The area has also regularly been explored as a potential location for an interisland ferry terminal connected to Wellington, but this has never progressed to construction.

==Inter-island ferry terminal==
Since the 1920s, there have been various proposals for an inter-island port and ferry terminal to replace Picton. Plans have never proceeded beyond an investigation stage, often due to the capital costs.

===1990s proposal===
In 1997, the then operator of the Interisland Line, Tranz Rail, proposed a new ferry terminal be built at Clifford Bay.

===2010s proposal===
In May 2011, plans were announced to revisit the development of a port at Clifford Bay, using a mix of private and public funding. Such a port would reduce both sailing time across the Cook Strait from Wellington and the surface distance to Christchurch. It would also allow ferries to operate at higher speeds than they can in the ecologically sensitive Marlborough Sounds and remove the steep grades on the Main North Line between Blenheim and Picton.

While a new port at Clifford Bay would have affected the economy of Picton, there were positive options to refocus Picton as a tourist centre, and the gateway to the Marlborough Sounds.

In November 2013, then-Minister of Transport Gerry Brownlee announced that the Government would not be building a new port at Clifford Bay, putting an end to two years of speculation.
