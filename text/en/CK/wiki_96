<text>A toposcope, topograph, or orientation table is a kind of graphic display erected at viewing points on hills, mountains or other high places which indicates the direction, and usually the distance, to notable landscape features which can be seen from that point. They are often placed in public parks, country parks, the grounds of stately homes, at popular vantage points (especially accompanying or built into triangulation stations) or places of historical note, such as battlefields.

Toposcopes usually show the points of the compass, or at least North.

Smaller toposcopes usually consist of a circular plaque, or a plaque with a circle marked on it, mounted horizontally on a plinth. They will have radiating lines indicating the direction to various landmarks, together with the distance and often a pictorial representation of the landmark. They are frequently constructed of a metal such as bronze, cast or etched, set on top of a concrete or stone block, which provides weather- and vandal-resistance.

Large toposcopes may be circular paved areas, with numerous plaques around the perimeter, each indicating a particular feature of the landscape.

<text>Spode is an English brand of pottery and homewares produced in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Spode was founded by Josiah Spode (1733–1797) in 1770, and was responsible for perfecting two important techniques that were crucial to the worldwide success of the English pottery industry in the 19th century: transfer printing on earthenware and bone china.

Spode perfected the technique for transfer printing in underglaze blue on fine earthenware in 1783–1784 – a development that led to the launch in 1816 of Spode&#x27;s Blue Italian range, which has remained in production ever since. The company is credited with developing, around 1790, the formula for bone china. Josiah Spode&#x27;s son, Josiah Spode II, successfully marketed bone china.

In 2008, the Copeland Spode company went through some financial troubles. It was taken over in 2009 by Portmeirion Group, a pottery and homewares company based in Stoke-on-Trent. Many items in Spode&#x27;s Blue Italian and Woodland ranges are made at Portmeirion Group&#x27;s factory in Stoke-on-Trent.

== Foundation ==
Josiah Spode is known to have worked for potter Thomas Whieldon from the age of 16 until he was 21. He then worked in a number of partnerships until he went into business for himself, renting a small potworks in Stoke-on-Trent in 1767; in 1776 he completed the purchase of what became the Spode factory until 2008. His early products comprised earthenwares such as creamware (a fine cream-coloured earthenware) and pearlware (a fine earthenware with a bluish glaze) as well as a range of stonewares including black basalt, caneware, and jasper which had been popularised by Josiah Wedgwood. The history and products of the Spode factory have inspired generations of historians and collectors, and a useful interactive online exhibition was launched in October 2010.

=== Underglaze blue transfer printing ===
Josiah Spode I is credited with the introduction of underglaze blue transfer printing on earthenware in 1783–84. The Worcester and Caughley factories had commenced transfer printing underglaze and over glaze on porcelain in the early 1750s, and from 1756 overglaze printing was also applied to earthenware and stoneware. The processes for underglaze and overglaze decoration were very different. Overglaze &quot;bat printing&quot; on earthenware was a fairly straightforward process, and designs in a range of colours including black, red and lilac were produced. Underglaze &quot;hot-press&quot; printing was limited to the colours that would withstand the subsequent glaze firing, and a rich blue was the predominant colour. 

To adapt the process from the production of small porcelain teaware to larger earthenware dinnerware required the creation of more flexible paper to transmit the designs from the engraved copper plate to the biscuit earthenware body, and the development of a glaze recipe that brought the colour of the black-blue cobalt print to a brilliant perfection. When Spode employed the skilled engraver Thomas Lucas and printer James Richard, both of the Caughley factory, in 1783 he was able to introduce high quality blue printed earthenware to the market. Thomas Minton, another Caughley-trained engraver, also supplied copper plates to Spode until he opened his own factory in Stoke-on-Trent in 1796.
This method involved the engraving of a design on a copper plate, which was then printed onto gummed tissue. The colour paste was worked into the cut areas of the copper plate and wiped from the uncut surfaces, and then printed by passing through rollers. These designs, including edge-patterns which had to be manipulated in sections, were cut out using scissors and applied to the biscuit-fired ware (using a white fabric), itself prepared with a gum solution. The tissue was then floated off in water, leaving the pattern adhering to the plate. This was then dipped in the glaze and returned to the kiln for the glost firing. Blue underglaze transfer became a standard feature of Staffordshire pottery. Spode also used on-glaze transfers for other wares. The well-known Spode blue-and-white dinner services with engraved sporting scenes and Italian views were developed under Josiah Spode the younger, but continued to be reproduced into much later times.

=== Bone china ===
During the 18th century, many English potters were striving and competing to discover the secret of the production of porcelain. The Plymouth and Bristol factories, and (from 1782 to 1810) the New Hall (Staffordshire) factory under Richard Champion&#x27;s patent, were producing hard paste similar to Oriental porcelain. The technique was developed by adding calcined bone to this glassy frit, for example in the productions of Bow porcelain and Chelsea porcelain, and this was carried on from at least the 1750s onwards. Soapstone porcelains further added steatite, known as French chalk, for instance at Worcester and Caughley factories.

The bone porcelains, especially those of Spode, Minton, Davenport and Coalport. Although the Bow porcelain factory, Chelsea porcelain factory, Royal Worcester and Royal Crown Derby factories had, before Spode, established a proportion of about 40–45 per cent calcined bone in the formula as standard, it was Spode who first abandoned the practice of calcining the bone with some of the other ingredients, and used a mix of bone ash, china stone and kaolin, which remains the basic recipe of bone china. The traditional bone china recipe was six parts bone-ash, four parts china stone and 3.5 parts kaolin.

Josiah Spode I effectively finalised the formula, and appears to have been doing so between 1789 and 1793. It remained an industrial secret for some time. The importance of his innovations has been disputed, being played down by Arthur Church in his &quot;English Porcelain&quot;, estimated practically by William Burton, and being very highly esteemed by Spode&#x27;s contemporary Alexandre Brongniart, director of the Sèvres manufactory, in his &quot;Traité des Arts Céramiques&quot;, and by M. L. Solon hailed as a revolutionary improvement.

Many examples of the elder Spode&#x27;s productions were destroyed in a fire at Alexandra Palace, London in 1873, where they were included in an exhibition of nearly five thousand specimens of English pottery and porcelain.

The business was carried on through his sons at Stoke until April 1833. Spode&#x27;s London retail shop in Portugal Street went by the name of Spode, Son, and Copeland.

Among the many surviving Spode documents are two shape books dated to about 1820 which contain thumbnail sketches of bone china objects with instructions to throwers and turners about size requirements. One copy is in the Joseph Downes collection at Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library in Delaware, United States.

==Spode &quot;Stone-China&quot;==
After some early trials Spode perfected a stoneware that came closer to porcelain than any previously, and introduced his &quot;Stone-China&quot; in 1813. It was light in body, greyish-white and gritty where it was not glazed and approached translucence in the early wares. Spode pattern books, which record about 75,000 patterns, survive from about 1800.

In Spode&#x27;s similar &quot;Felspar porcelain&quot;, introduced on the market in 1821, felspar was an ingredient, substituted for the Cornish stone in his standard bone china body, giving rise to his slightly misleading name &quot;Felspar porcelain&quot;, to what is in fact an extremely refined stoneware comparable to the rival &quot;Mason&#x27;s ironstone&quot;, produced by Josiah II&#x27;s nephew, Charles James Mason, and patented in 1813 Spode&#x27;s &quot;Felspar porcelain&quot; continued into the Copeland &amp; Garrett phase of the company (1833–1847). Armorial services were provided for the Honourable East India Company, 1823, and the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, &quot;c&quot;1824. Some of the ware employed underglaze blue and iron red with touches of gilding in imitation of &quot;Imari porcelain&quot; that had been introduced on Spode&#x27;s bone china in the first decade of the century: the most familiar &quot;Tobacco-leaf pattern&quot; (2061) continued to be made by Spode&#x27;s successors, William Taylor Copeland, and then &quot;W.T. Copeland &amp; Sons, late Spode&quot;.

== Later forms of the business ==
Messrs Spode were succeeded in the same business in c. 1833 by Copeland and Garrett, who often used the name Spode in their marks. In particular these are called &#x27;Late Spode&#x27; and include productions of the so-called &#x27;Felspar porcelain&#x27;. They also produced other kinds of bone china, earthenware, parian, etc. The partnership continued in this form until 1847. After 1847 the business continued until 1970 as W.T. Copeland and sons, and again the term &#x27;Spode&#x27; or &#x27;Late Spode&#x27; continued in use alongside the name of Copeland. Under the name &#x27;Spode Ltd&#x27; the same factories and business were continued after 1970.

In 2006, the business merged with Royal Worcester. The merged company entered administration on 6 November 2008. The brand names Royal Worcester and Spode, the intellectual property and some of the stock were acquired by Portmeirion Group on 23 April 2009.

The purchase did not include Royal Worcester or Spode manufacturing facilities. Many items in Spode&#x27;s Blue Italian and Woodland ranges are now made at Portmeirion Group&#x27;s factory in Stoke-on-Trent.

In 2012, the Spode Museum Trust opened the Spode Works Visitor Centre in part of the historic Spode factory.

<doc id="1148634" wikidata="Q1939027" url="?curid=1148634" title="Mission Beach, Queensland">
<text>Mission Beach is a coastal town and locality in the Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Mission Beach had a population of 1,014 people.

== Geography ==
Mission Beach is bounded on the east by the Coral Sea. 

Clump Point () is the northern end of a sandy beach long facing the Coral Sea which runs south to Tam O&#x27;Shanter Point in South Mission Beach at the southern end.

== History ==
=== Djiru ===
The region has been inhabited for at least the past 5,000 years by a rainforest dwelling people collectively known as the Djiru people. Remains of middens, fish traps, rock-shelter paintings and ceremonial sites are located around Mission Beach and Dunk Island. Djiru people made large wooden swords and built wet-season villages consisting of dome-shaped huts thatched with palm fronds and paperbark.

=== British exploration ===
Lieutenant James Cook sailed through the area in 1770, naming Dunk Island. Clump Point was descriptively named in 1848 by Captain Owen Stanley of the Royal Navy survey ship HMS &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;. On board was the Cape York Peninsula exploration party led by Edmund Kennedy which was landed to the south of the region to begin their ill-fated overland journey. After the disembarkation of Kennedy&#x27;s group, Captain Stanley anchored off Dunk Island and he and his crew remained in the vicinity for ten days. They traded with the local Djiru people until a crew member shot at them after being prevented from entering a nearby village.

=== The shipwreck of the &quot;Maria&quot; ===
On 26 February 1872, the brig &quot;Maria&quot; carrying 75 people of a gold prospecting expedition to New Guinea was wrecked upon Bramble Reef. The survivors escaped the sinking ship on 3 boats and 2 rafts. Two of the boats made it safely to the nearest British settlement of Cardwell, but the other three craft were washed up on the shoreline at and around what is now Mission Beach. Up to ten of these crew members, including the captain, were found to have been murdered by Aboriginal people residing in this region. Lieutenant Sabben of the Royal Navy was sent to recover the captain&#x27;s boat and find any survivors. Upon reaching the beached boat they were attacked by about 120 Aboriginal men. In resisting the attack, 8 native people were killed. Fearing further attacks, Magistrate Brinsley Sheridan, ordered Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone of the Native Police &quot;to inflict decisive punishment&quot;. Johnstone and his troopers were significantly aided by another Royal Navy officer in Captain John Moresby who provided additional armed marines and a large schooner. Moresby described how &quot;several unfortunate blacks were shot down by the native troopers, who showed an unrestrained ferocity that disgusted our officers&quot;. A six-year-old boy was taken during this raid and sent to England by the &quot;kind act&quot; of Lieutenant Francis Hayter. The boy died there from pneumonia three years later.

Johnstone and his troopers, together with armed sailors and volunteer riflemen, scoured the coast from Cardwell north to Cooper Point, searching every Aboriginal camp they came across for any traces of the men. Newspapers reported that Johnstone&#x27;s detachment of Native Police killed a total of 93 local Aboriginal people in the &quot;Maria&quot; reprisals. Accusations of Johnstone and others having &quot;punished the innocent together with the guilty&quot; and partaking in &quot;slaughtering whole camps, not only of men, but of women and children&quot; even reached the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, Robert Herbert. The claims were dismissed by Lord Normanby, Governor of Queensland, on the grounds that the Aboriginal people of the north &quot;are numerous, savage, treacherous, and very commonly cannibals&quot;.

Various localities around Mission Beach were named after entities and events involved in the shipwreck of the &quot;Maria&quot; including Maria Creek and the Johnstone River.

=== British settlement ===
Up until the late 1870s, the area was still considered too dangerous for British settlement and the Djiru were able to maintain their traditional livelihood in a landscape that had the &quot;appearance of some wealthy nobleman&#x27;s estate.&quot; Charles Freshney&#x27;s logging company started to cut down the groves of cedar trees around Clump Point from 1880. They employed Aboriginal people for timber hauling, paying them with tobacco and tools. 

The first white settlers to establish a landholding in the region were the Cutten brothers (Herbert, Leonard, James and Sidney), who took up their selections in 1886. They built a homestead which they called Bicton (now Bingil Bay), and farmed mangoes, bananas, pineapples, coffee, citrus fruit and coconuts. By 1890, the Cutten brothers were not able to support the remaining Djiru living on what was now their property. The Cuttens threatened to exterminate the Djiru and burnt down their main camp, but kept around 40 people to labour on their plantations. Initially these workers were indentured on government wages but by 1910 the Cuttens were accused of paying their remaining Djiru labourers with rum. The Cuttens starting selling out of the area in 1918 after a cyclone destroyed their plantations. After the Cutten brothers, the Unsworths settled at Narragon Beach, the Garners came and settled at Garners Beach, and the Porter brothers settled at what the locals refer to as Porter&#x27;s Creek (also called Wongaling Creek) at the south end of North Mission Beach.

=== Hull River Aboriginal Settlement ===
In the early 20th century Chinese banana farmers used Aboriginal people as labourers in the Tully River region. Opium addiction and conflict with British settlers resulted in the Queensland government creating an Aboriginal internment centre, the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement, at the present South Mission Beach. John Martin Kenny was appointed superintendent in September 1914. There was no mission in the religious sense; the settlement had characteristics of a penal settlement. Forced removals from other regions swelled the population to around 500 by 1916. Many ran away and about 200 people died there in 1917 during an epidemic.

On 10 March 1918, a category 5 cyclone hit the Innisfail area, killing at least 100 people in the region. A storm surge in the Mission Beach area swept hundreds of metres inland leaving debris 7m up in some trees. This cyclone destroyed the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement, killing the superintendent Kenny, his daughter and other residents. The surviving residents were forcibly moved to a new settlement on Great Palm Island.

=== Development of the town ===
In the late 1920s after the construction of a road from El Arish, the area became a popular camping place. It was known as Mission Beach due to the mistaken belief that the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement previously located in the region was a religious mission. Mission Beach developed into a town during the 1940s and 50s with the Mission Beach Post Office opening on 15 December 1949.

Mission Beach State School opened on 27 January 1953 in the &quot;tropical jungle&quot; of Mission Beach. On 1 February 1993, the school re-opened at a new site in Wongaling Beach to the south.

On 20 March 2006, Cyclone Larry crossed the coast in between Mission Beach and Innisfail. In addition to structural damage to property, Cyclone Larry also had a tremendous impact on the rainforest and animals of the region. A shortage of rainforest fruit saw cassowaries seeking food in built up areas and, unfortunately, a number were hit and killed by cars.

On 3 February 2011, the eyewall of Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi crossed the coast near Mission Beach. Wind gusts estimated up to , leaving behind significant damage. A storm surge estimated to have reached destroyed several structures along the coast and pushed up to inland. Most of the beach had lost its sand and all of the towns structures were damaged to some degree, with many houses completely destroyed. There were no reports of fatalities or injuries in Mission Beach.

In 2019, Mayfair 101, an Australian-based investment consortium, bought 200 properties in Mission Beach as well as nearby Dunk Island with the view to transform the area into a &quot;tourism mecca&quot;. By August 2020, Dunk Island had been repossessed by the former owners, and investigations by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission led to the freezing of assets of 14 property trusts Mayfair 101 had used to buy land in and around Mission Beach.

This festival was created to promote the unique wildlife of the region and to celebrate the community through music, activities and education. The town also formerly celebrated the annual aquatic festival, it has since been discontinued since 2017.

== Tourism ==

The beach is flanked by green mountains rising just a short distance inland, and provides views out to the Family Islands. Close to shore at Mission Beach lies a shallow reef; during very low tides portions of this reef are exposed. The reef runs from the mouth of Porter&#x27;s Creek at the south end of North Mission Beach almost to Clump Point, and is a popular fishing spot.
Surrounded by World Heritage rainforest on one side and the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef on the other, Mission Beach is home to many wildlife species, most notable is the cassowary. This large flightless bird can be found in the rainforest surrounding the area but appears to be thriving in spite of land clearing, traffic and predators such as wild dogs and feral pigs. Much of the area is part of the Coastal Wet Tropics Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of lowland tropical rainforest birds.

Mission Beach is also the mainland gateway to Dunk Island, with water-taxis shuttling day-trippers out to the island.

<text>William Percey Wennington (born April 26, 1963) is a Canadian former professional basketball player who won three National Basketball Association (NBA) championships with the Chicago Bulls. A center, he represented Canada in the 1984 Olympics and 1983 World University Games, where the team won gold. He was also on the Canadian team that narrowly missed qualification for the 1992 Olympics. Wennington has been inducted into the Quebec Basketball Hall of Fame and the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Amateur career==
Born in Montreal, Wennington later attended New York&#x27;s Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School, where he played under coach Bob McKillop, and led the Crusaders to, at one time, a No. 1 ranking in the northeast region, and a top 10 ranking in the nation. He then was recruited to St. John&#x27;s University, and he played on one NCAA Final Four team under basketball coach Lou Carnesecca.

==Professional career==
He was drafted 16th in the first round of the 1985 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks, where he played his first several seasons. Wennington made his NBA debut on October 29, 1985. On June 26, 1990, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings along with two 1990 first-round draft picks in exchange for Rodney McCray and two future second-round draft picks.

Before signing as a free agent with the Chicago Bulls in 1993, he spent a few years in Italy playing for Virtus (Knorr) from Bologna. In 1998, Chicago-area McDonald&#x27;s restaurants sold a sandwich named after Wennington called the Beef Wennington. After the break-up of the highly successful Chicago Bulls of the 1990s, Wennington played his final NBA season with the Sacramento Kings. He played alongside Ron Harper, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. Wennington was the backup center for Luc Longley.

==Post-basketball career==
After his playing career ended, Wennington became a radio color commentator for the Bulls. Wennington was inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005.

<doc id="1148650" wikidata="Q1176073" url="?curid=1148650" title="David Peace">
<text>David Peace (born 1967) is an English writer. Best known for his UK-set novels Red Riding Quartet (1999–2002), &quot;GB84&quot; (2004), &quot;The Damned Utd&quot; (2006), and &quot;Red or Dead&quot; (2013), Peace was named one of the Best of Young British Novelists by &quot;Granta&quot; in their 2003 list. His books often deal with themes of mental breakdown or derangement in the face of extreme circumstances. In an interview with David Mitchell, he stated: &quot;I was drawn to writing about individuals and societies in moments that are often extreme, and often at times of defeat, be they personal or broader, or both. I believe that in such moments, during such times, in how we react and how we live, we learn who we truly are, for better or worse.&quot;

==Biography==
David Peace was born in Dewsbury and grew up in Ossett, West Yorkshire. He was educated at Batley Grammar School, Wakefield College and Manchester Polytechnic, which he left in 1991 to go to Istanbul to teach English. He cites his father&#x27;s book collection, and reading the &quot;NME&quot; between 1979 and 1985, as formative influences. He moved to Tokyo in 1994 and returned to the UK in 2009. He went back to Tokyo in 2011 because he found it hard to write in Britain. He has lectured in the Department of Contemporary Literary Studies at the University of Tokyo since his return to Tokyo in 2011.

==&quot;Red-Riding Quartet&quot;==
The &quot;Red-Riding Quartet&quot; comprises the novels &quot;Nineteen Seventy-Four&quot; (1999), &quot;Nineteen Seventy-Seven&quot; (2000), &quot;Nineteen Eighty&quot; (2001) and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Three&quot; (2002). The books deal with police corruption, and are set against a backdrop of the Yorkshire Ripper murders between 1975 and 1980. They feature several recurring characters. &quot;Red Riding&quot;, a three-part TV adaptation of the series, aired on Channel 4 in the UK in 2009. The cast includes Sean Bean, Andrew Garfield, David Morrissey and Rebecca Hall.

==&quot;GB84&quot;==
Peace followed the quartet with &quot;GB84&quot; (2004). This is a fictional portrayal of the year of the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–1985). It describes the insidious workings of the British government and MI5, the coalfield battles, the struggle for influence in government and the dwindling powers of the National Union of Mineworkers. The book was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for literature in 2005.

==&quot;The Damned Utd, Red or Dead&quot;==
He followed &quot;GB84&quot; with another fact-based fictional piece, &quot;The Damned Utd&quot; (2006), which is based on Brian Clough&#x27;s fateful 44-day spell in 1974 as manager of Leeds United Football Club. Entering the mind of the man who many regard as a football genius, Peace tells the story of a man characterised by a fear of failure and a hunger for success. Peace has described it as an &quot;occult history of Leeds United&quot;. Former footballer and manager Johnny Giles threatened to sue Peace for &quot;The Damned Utd&quot; as to what he perceived were gross untruths in the book. As part of an out of court settlement, the publisher of &quot;The Damned Utd&quot;, Faber and Faber, agreed to remove from any future editions the references perceived by Giles as damaging and untrue.

Peace is a supporter of Huddersfield Town, a club who are a local rival of Leeds United, and the team that Leeds United played in Clough&#x27;s first and last games in charge of the club. &quot;The Damned Utd&quot; has been made into a film entitled &quot;The Damned United&quot;, with Michael Sheen playing Brian Clough.

Peace&#x27;s novel &quot;Red or Dead&quot;, about Bill Shankly and the rise of Liverpool Football Club, was published in August 2013 and was shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize that year.

==&quot;Tokyo Trilogy&quot;==
&quot;Tokyo Year Zero&quot; (2007) follows the investigations of a Tokyo detective in the aftermath of Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II. It is based on the true story of serial killer Yoshio Kodaira. It is the first of Peace&#x27;s novels to be set outside of Yorkshire and forms the first part of a trio of books on the U.S. military occupation of Japan. The second book, published in August 2009, is called &quot;Occupied City&quot;, a &quot;Rashomon&quot;-like telling of the Hirasawa Sadamichi case in Tokyo in 1948. The final volume, &quot;Tokyo Redux&quot;, published in 2021, is based on the 1949 Shimoyama incident.

As a separate stand-alone novel, but set in Japan, &quot;Patient X&quot;, was published in 2018. Subtitled &quot;The Case-Book of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa&quot;, it follows the life of author Akutagawa from his childhood to his suicide in 1927, including his witnessing of the Great Kantō earthquake that devastated most of Tokyo and much of the surrounding region in 1923.

==Plans==
Peace&#x27;s plans include &quot;UKDK&quot;, about the changing face of UK politics, set around the fall of Harold Wilson and rise of Margaret Thatcher, and titles possibly including &quot;The Yorkshire Rippers&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Forty Seven&quot;. He has also begun preparing a novel about Geoffrey Boycott and his relationship with Yorkshire County Cricket Club and England. He intends to stop writing novels after his twelfth novel but has joked he may publish a collection of his &quot;very bad poetry&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Defence&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built by Israel Pownoll and launched on 31 March 1763 at Plymouth Dockyard. She was one of the most famous ships of the period, taking part in several of the most important naval battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. In 1811 she was wrecked off the coast of Jutland with the loss of almost her entire crew.

==Career==
During the American War of Independence, &quot;Defence&quot; served with the Channel Fleet, seeing action at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in 1780. She was sent out to India in early 1782 as part of a squadron of five ships under Commodore Sir Richard Bickerton, arriving too late for the battles of that year. But in 1783 she took part in the last battle of the war, at Cuddalore. She returned to England at the end of 1785. She was then laid up during the years of peace until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Recommissioned into the Channel Fleet under Captain James Gambier, she fought at the Glorious First of June in 1794, distinguishing herself in action against and , and becoming one of only two British ships to be completely dismasted in the battle. After repairs, she was sent to the Mediterranean, joining Admiral William Hotham in time to take part in the Battle of Hyeres in July.

&quot;Defence&quot; was at Plymouth on 20 January 1795 and so shared in the proceeds of the detention of the Dutch naval vessels, East Indiamen, and other merchant vessels that were in port on the outbreak of war between Britain and the Netherlands.

In 1798 she returned to the Mediterranean under Captain John Peyton, taking part in the Battle of the Nile in August.

On 1 July 1800, &quot;Defence&quot;, , and the were in Bourneuf Bay when they sent in their boats to attack a French convoy at Île de Noirmoutier. The British destroyed the French ship &quot;Therese&quot; (of 20 guns), a lugger (12 guns), two schooners (6 guns each) and a cutter (6 guns), of unknown names. The cutting out party also burned some 15 merchant vessels loaded with corn and supplies for the French fleet at Brest. However, in this enterprise, 92 officers and men out of the entire party of 192 men, fell prisoners to the French when their boats became stranded. &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; had contributed no men to the attacking force and so had no casualties.

In 1801, &quot;Defence&quot; sailed to the Baltic under Captain Lord Henry Paulet with Admiral Hyde Parker&#x27;s fleet. She was present at the Battle of Copenhagen, but did not see action as she was part of the reserve under Parker.

In 1805 she saw action again at the Battle of Trafalgar, where under Captain George Johnstone Hope, she captured the and fought the , suffering 36 casualties.

&quot;Defence&quot; was one of the British ships in support of the 1809 Walcheren Campaign which was intended to capture Vlissingen (Flushing) and Antwerp in the Netherlands.

==Loss==

She ran aground on 24 December 1811 off the west coast of Jutland, Denmark. She was under the command of Captain D. Atkins and in the company of , under Rear-Admiral Robert Carthew Reynolds, and , when a hurricane and heavy seas came up. &quot;St George&quot; was jury-rigged and so Atkins refused to leave her without the admiral&#x27;s permission. As a result, both were wrecked near Ringkøbing. &quot;Cressy&quot; did not ask for permission and so avoided wrecking.
&quot;Defence&quot; lost all but 14 of her crew of 597 men and boys, including her captain. &quot;St George&quot; too lost almost her entire crew, including the admiral. Most of the bodies that came ashore were buried in the sand dunes of Thorsminde, which have been known ever since as &quot;Dead Mens Dunes&quot;. The Danish authorities quickly ordered Lieutenant Wigelsen to the area as Receiver of Wreck

==Captain Atkins and his culpability for the loss==
Captain David Atkins is first noted as a midshipman under Captain Erasmus Gower in in 1780–81. For two years commencing in 1792, he was 3rd lieutenant with Gower in under Gower. John Barrow later claimed Atkins while on &quot;Lion&quot; was a navigator, &quot;showing skill in lunar observations way beyond his years&quot;. He followed Gower onto and was first lieutenant on &quot;Triumph&quot; from 1794. He was promoted captain in 1798; in 1801, he was promoted to captain; and thence to flag captain to Gower on &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. In 1805 was captained by him. In 1809, he commanded &quot;Defence&quot; in the Walcheren Expedition.

Accounting for blame for the loss is conflicted. Some say he followed HMS &quot;St George&quot; onto the reef. As published by Brenton 3 Brenton (1837) &quot;Naval History of Great Britain&quot; the &quot;St George&quot;, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Robert Carthew Reynolds, ran ashore. Ostensibly, when told of this, Atkins asked whether the admiral had made the signal giving him leave to part company. Hearing a denial, Atkins said: &quot;I will never desert my Admiral in the hour of danger and distress.&quot; &quot;Defence&quot; ran aground and was overcome by a breaking sea. The breakup led to loss of 593 men, her full complement being 597. One of the survivors said that &quot;At half-past twelve the captain told Mr. Baker he would not wear till the St. George did, but would stay by her.&quot;

On the other hand, the &quot;Annual Register&quot; (Vol 54), however, states that &quot;HMS &quot;Defence&quot; was the first ship to run aground and that HMS &quot;St George&quot; (flagship) immediately let go its anchor but that the ship swung around on her cable and also went aground as a result.&quot; This account was corroborated by an account printed in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1812. In the incident, &quot;HMS &quot;St George&quot; was also destroyed, with the loss of 838 lives, including Reynolds.&quot; Given the fog of war and passage of time, this historical debate may never be conclusively resolved.

Atkins&#x27; body was buried with full Military honours by the Danes.

<doc id="1148654" wikidata="Q1572785" url="?curid=1148654" title="Battle of Rabaul (1942)">
<text>The Battle of Rabaul, also known by the Japanese as Operation R, an instigating action of the New Guinea campaign, was fought on the island of New Britain in the Australian Territory of New Guinea, from 23 January into February 1942. It was a strategically significant defeat of Allied forces by Japan in the Pacific campaign of World War II, with the Japanese invasion force quickly overwhelming the small Australian garrison, the majority of which was either killed or captured. Hostilities on the neighbouring island of New Ireland are usually considered to be part of the same battle. Rabaul was significant because of its proximity to the Japanese territory of the Caroline Islands, site of a major Imperial Japanese Navy base on Truk.

Following the capture of the port of Rabaul, Japanese forces turned it into a major base and proceeded to land on mainland New Guinea, advancing toward Port Moresby. Heavy fighting followed along the Kokoda Track, and around Milne Bay, before the Japanese were eventually pushed back towards Buna–Gona by early 1943. As part of Operation Cartwheel, throughout 1943–1945, Allied forces later sought to isolate the Japanese garrison on Rabaul, rather than capturing it, largely using air power to do so, with US and Australian ground forces pursuing a limited campaign in western New Britain during this time.

By the end of the war, there was still a sizeable garrison at Rabaul, with large quantities of equipment that were subsequently abandoned. In the aftermath, it took the Allies over two years to repatriate the captured Japanese soldiers, while clean up efforts continued past the late 1950s. Many relics including ships, aircraft and weapons, as well as abandoned positions and tunnels, remain in the area.

==Prelude==

Rabaul lies on the eastern end of the island of New Britain. At the time of the battle, the town was the capital of the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea, having been captured from the Germans in 1914. In March 1941, the Australians dispatched a small garrison to the region, as tensions with Japan heightened. The small Australian Army garrison in New Britain was built around Lieutenant Colonel Howard Carr&#x27;s 700-strong 2/22nd Battalion, an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) infantry battalion. This battalion formed part of Lark Force, which eventually numbered 1,400 men and was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Scanlan. The force also included personnel from a local Militia unit, the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles (NGVR), a coastal defence battery, an anti-aircraft battery, an anti-tank battery and a detachment of the 2/10th Field Ambulance.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/22nd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2/22nd Battalion Band—which was also included in Lark Force—is perhaps the only military unit ever to have been entirely recruited from the ranks of the Salvation Army. A commando unit, the 130-strong 2/1st Independent Company, was detached to garrison the nearby island of New Ireland.

Throughout 1941, the Allies had planned to build Rabaul up as a &quot;secure fleet anchorage&quot; with plans to establish a radar station and a strong defensive minefield; however, these plans were ultimately shelved. Allied planners later determined that they did not have the capacity to expand the garrison around Rabaul, nor was the naval situation conducive to reinforcing it should the garrison come under attack. Nevertheless, the decision was made that the garrison would remain in place to hold Rabaul as a forward observation post. The main tasks of the garrison were protection of Vunakanau, the main Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) airfield near Rabaul, and the nearby flying boat anchorage in Simpson Harbour, which were important for the surveillance of Japanese movements in the region. However, the RAAF contingent, under Wing Commander John Lerew, had little offensive capability with only 10 lightly armed CAC Wirraway training aircraft and four Lockheed Hudson light bombers from No. 24 Squadron.

For the Japanese, Rabaul was important because of its proximity to the Caroline Islands, which was the site of a major Imperial Japanese Navy base on Truk. The capture of New Britain offered them a deep water harbour and airfields to provide protection to Truk and also to interdict Allied lines of communication between the United States and Australia. Following the capture of Guam, the South Seas Detachment, under Major General Tomitaro Horii, was tasked with capturing Kavieng and Rabaul as part of &quot;Operation R&quot;.

Japanese planning began with aerial reconnaissance of the town, which sought to identify the dispositions of the defending troops. Planners, who had been flown from Guam to Truk, determined three possible schemes of manoeuvre based on these dispositions: a landing near Kokop, aimed at establishing a beachhead; a landing on the north coast of Rabaul, followed by a drive on Rabaul from behind the main defences; or a multi-pronged landing focused on capturing the airfields and centre of the town. They settled upon the third option. The Japanese established a brigade group based on the 55th Division. Its main combat units were the 144th Infantry Regiment, which consisted of a headquarters unit, three infantry battalions, an artillery company, signals unit, and a munitions squad, as well as a few platoons from the 55th Cavalry Regiment, a battalion from the 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment and a company from the 55th Engineer Regiment. These forces would be supported by a large naval task force, and landing operations would be preceded by a heavy aerial campaign aimed at destroying Allied air assets in region so they could not interfere with the landing operations.

==Battle==
In December 1941, shortly before Japanese air raids began, most civilian men were forced to stay in Rabaul, but women who were not necessary to the defence of the base were evacuated. Starting on 4 January 1942, Rabaul came under attack by large numbers of Japanese carrier-based aircraft. After the odds facing the Australians mounted significantly, Lerew signalled RAAF headquarters in Melbourne with the Latin phrase &quot;Nos Morituri Te Salutamus&quot; (&quot;we who are about to die salute you&quot;), supposedly uttered by gladiators in ancient Rome before entering combat. 

On 14 January, the Japanese force embarked at Truk and began steaming towards Rabaul as part of a naval task force, which consisted of four aircraft carriers— , , &quot;Shokaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; — seven cruisers, 14 destroyers, and numerous smaller vessels and submarines under the command of Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue. On 20 January, over 100 Japanese aircraft attacked Rabaul in multiple waves. Eight Wirraways attacked, and in the ensuing fighting three RAAF planes were shot down, two crash-landed, and another was damaged. Six Australian aircrew were killed in action and five wounded. One of the attacking Japanese bombers was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. As a result of the intense air attacks, Australian coastal artillery was destroyed, and Australian infantry withdrew from Rabaul. The following day, an RAAF Catalina flying boat crew located the invasion fleet off Kavieng, and its crew managed to send a signal before being shot down.

As the Australian ground troops took up positions along the western shore of Blanche Bay where they prepared to meet the landing, the remaining RAAF elements, consisting of two Wirraways and one Hudson, were withdrawn to Lae. Once the aircraft had departed with a number of wounded, the Australians destroyed the airfield. The bombing continued around Rabaul on 22 January, and early that morning a Japanese force of between 3,000 and 4,000 troops landed just off New Ireland and waded ashore in deep water filled with dangerous mud pools. The 2/1st Independent Company had been dispersed around the island, and the Japanese took the main town of Kavieng without opposition; after a sharp fight around the airfield the commandos fell back towards the Sook River. That night, the invasion fleet approached Rabaul, and before dawn on 23 January, the South Seas Force entered Simpson Harbour and a force of around 5,000 troops, mainly from the 144th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Masao Kusunose, began to land on New Britain.

A series of desperate actions followed near the beaches around Simpson Harbour, Keravia Bay and Raluana Point as the Australians attempted to turn back the attack. The 3rd Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Kuwada Ishiro, was held up at Vulcan Beach by a mixed company of Australians from the 2/22nd and the NGVR, but elsewhere the other two battalions of the South Seas Force were able to land at unguarded locations and began moving inland. Within hours, Lakunai airfield had been captured by the Japanese force. Assessing the situation as hopeless, Scanlan ordered &quot;every man for himself&quot;, and Australian soldiers and civilians split into small groups, up to company size, and retreated through the jungle, moving along the north and south coasts. During the fighting on 23 January, the Australians lost two officers and 26 other ranks killed in action.

Only the RAAF had made evacuation plans. Although initially ordered to turn his ground staff into infantrymen in a last-ditch effort to defend the island, Lerew insisted that they be evacuated and organised for them to be flown out by flying boat and his one remaining Hudson. In the days that followed the capture of Rabaul, the Japanese began mopping up operations, starting on 24 January. Australian soldiers remained at large in the interior of New Britain for many weeks, but Lark Force had made no preparations for guerrilla warfare on New Britain. Without supplies, their health and military effectiveness declined. Leaflets posted by Japanese patrols or dropped from planes stated in English, &quot;you can find neither food nor way of escape in this island and you will only die of hunger unless you surrender.&quot; The Japanese commander, Horii, tasked the 3rd Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment with searching the southern part of the Gazelle Peninsula and securing the remaining Australians. Over 1,000 Australian soldiers were captured or surrendered during the following weeks after the Japanese landed a force at Gasmata, on New Britain&#x27;s south coast, on 9 February, severing the Australians&#x27; line of retreat. Following this, the Japanese reorganised their forces, occupying a line along the Keravat River, to prevent possible counterattacks.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
From mainland New Guinea, some civilians and individual officers from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit organised unofficial rescue missions to New Britain, and between March and May about 450 troops and civilians were evacuated by sea. Notwithstanding these efforts, Allied losses, particularly in relation to personnel captured, were very high, and casualties were heavily in favour of the Japanese. The Allies lost six aircrew killed and five wounded, along with 28 soldiers killed in action, and over 1,000 captured. Against this, the Japanese lost only 16 killed and 49 wounded.

====Tol Plantation massacre ====

Of the over 1,000 Australian soldiers taken prisoner, around 160 were massacred on or about 4 February in four separate incidents around Tol and Waitavalo. Six men survived these killings and later described what had happened to a Court of Inquiry. The Australian government concluded the prisoners were marched into the jungle near Tol Plantation in small groups and were then bayoneted by Japanese soldiers. At the nearby Waitavalo Plantation, another group of Australian prisoners were shot. The Allies later placed responsibility for the incident on Masao Kusunose, the commanding officer of the 144th Infantry Regiment, but in late 1946 he starved himself to death before he could stand trial. At least 800 soldiers and 200 civilian prisoners of war—most of them Australian—lost their lives on 1 July 1942, when the ship on which they were being transported from Rabaul to Japan, the &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;, was sunk off the north coast of Luzon by the U.S. submarine .

===Subsequent operations===
According to Japanese author Kengoro Tanaka, the operation to capture Rabaul was the only operation of the New Guinea campaign that was completely successful for the Japanese. Following the capture of Rabaul, the Japanese quickly repaired the damage to Rabaul&#x27;s airfield, and Rabaul became the largest Japanese base in New Guinea and the linchpin to their defences in the region. The Australians tried to restrict Rabaul&#x27;s development soon after its capture by a bombing counter-attack in March. The Japanese eventually extended their control across New Britain, establishing airfields at Cape Gloucester on the island&#x27;s western tip and several small outposts along the coast to provide stop-over points for small boats travelling between Rabaul and New Guinea. Meanwhile, a handful of Lark Force members remained at large on New Britain and New Ireland and, in conjunction with the local islanders, conducted guerrilla operations against the Japanese, serving mainly as coastwatchers, providing information of Japanese shipping movements.

For the Japanese, the capture of Rabaul was followed with further operations on mainland New Guinea, beginning with operations to capture the Salamaua–Lae region beginning in March 1942. Throughout 1942 and into early 1943, the Allies and Japanese fought along the Kokoda Track, at Milne Bay and around Buna–Gona as the Japanese sought to advance south towards Port Moresby. By mid-1943, the tide turned in favour of the Allies, who began an offensive in the Pacific aimed at advancing north through New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. By late November 1943 the Japanese force in Rabaul had been reduced by airpower, with a large raid being mounted from the aircraft carriers and on 5 November. According to author Eric Larrabee, &quot;thereafter no Japanese heavy ships ever came to Rabaul.&quot;

Allied planners had considered capturing Rabaul, but they eventually settled on isolating it and bypassing it as part of Operation Cartwheel. In December 1943, U.S. Marines and Army soldiers landed in western New Britain at Arawe and Cape Gloucester. Subsequently, Allied operations on New Britain gradually restricted the Japanese force to the area around Rabaul. In November 1944, the Australians returned to the island when advanced elements of the 5th Division landed at Jacquinot Bay on the south coast and relieved the US 40th Infantry Division. The Australians then conducted landings around the island as they conducted a limited advance north, securing a line across the base of the Gazelle Peninsula between Wide Bay and Open Bay. After this, they sought to isolate and contain the main Japanese forces around Rabaul. When Japan surrendered in August 1945, there were still around 69,000 Japanese troops in Rabaul.

Large quantities of equipment were subsequently abandoned around Rabaul after the war, and it took over two years for the Allies to repatriate the Japanese garrison that was captured after Japan surrendered. In the late 1950s, Japanese salvage companies began work to salvage many of the ship wrecks around Rabaul. Many abandoned positions, tunnels, and equipment relics such as aircraft and weapons can still be found in the area.

<doc id="1148656" wikidata="Q3534319" url="?curid=1148656" title="Surjit Singh Barnala">
<text>Surjit Singh Barnala (21 October 1925 – 14 January 2017) was an Indian politician who served as the 11th chief minister of Punjab state from 1985 to 1987. Following that he served as the governor of Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, lieutenant governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and a Union Minister on handling various portfolios.

==Early life==

Barnala was born in Begpur Village in Ateli Tehsil, Haryana. Born of a well-to-do family (his father was a magistrate), Barnala passed law from Lucknow University in 1945. In Lucknow, he was involved in the Quit India Movement of 1942. Subsequently, he practised law for some years, and became politically active in the late 1960s, rising through the ranks of Akali Dal. Though, he first stood for election in 1952 but lost by a meagre 4 votes.

==Politics==

Barnala&#x27;s first ministerial assignment was in 1969 when he has sworn in as education minister in the Justice Gurnam Singh Government and was instrumental in setting up the Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar.

In 1977 he was elected to the Indian Parliament and was inducted in the Morarji Desai Cabinet as the agriculture minister at the time when the ministry included Irrigation Water Resources, Food, Environment and Forests, Consumer Affairs, Power and Chemical And Fertilizers and Rural Development. In 1978, Barnala signed the historic Ganga Waters Agreement (Farakka Agreement) with Bangladesh.

In 1979, during the turmoil in the national government when PM Morarji Desai resigned, the then-president Neelam Sanjiva Reddy toyed with the idea of appointing an interim government with Barnala as prime minister but had to drop the idea at the last moment, fearing horse-trading by a top member of the Cabinet, and Deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh assumed prime ministership.

Barnala served as chief minister of Punjab from 29 September 1985 until 11 May 1987. Barnala, a member of the Sikh political party Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal), served as chief minister during a period of Sikh militant movement in Punjab. The state had under in Barnala&#x27;s chief ministership from 1985 to 1987, and after nearly two years in office, President&#x27;s Rule was imposed.
In 1996, Barnala once again came close to becoming prime minister as in the 1996 Indian general election, with no political party getting a mandate, it was a good time for a regional party to have its prime minister. Regional parties accounted for about 80 MPs in the Lok Sabha. The Asom Gana Parishad of Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and Telugu Desam Party of Chandra Babu Naidu, including The Left parties, zeroed on Barnala, but at the last minute Barnala&#x27;s parent party Shiromani Akali Dal led by Barnala&#x27;s supposedly close friend Parkash Singh Badal without informing Barnala joined hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party hence Barnala yet again missed being Prime Minister.

In 1997, Barnala was a candidate of the BJP and its allies in the election of the vice-president of India.

In 1998, Barnala was again elected to Parliament and became the minister for Chemical &amp; Fertilizers and Food &amp; Consumer Affairs in the Vajpayee Cabinet.

At the time of his death, he was the patron of a four-party alliance Sanja Morcha in Punjab. Like few other anti-Congress leaders of his time, he has spent about three and a half years in jail as a political prisoner, including 11 months in solitary confinement.

== Governorship ==

Since then, Barnala has served as a governor of several states. He first served as governor of Tamil Nadu from 1990 to 1991 for about nine months. Barnala refused to recommend the dismissal of the Tamil Nadu government, and when he was later transferred as governor of Bihar he chose to resign. He served as the lieutenant governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands from December 1990 to 18 March 1993.

He was the first governor of Uttarakhand from its creation in 2000 until 2003, and governor of Andhra Pradesh from 2003 to 2004. During this time he also held additional charge of Orissa as governor for some time and was governor of Tamil Nadu until 31 August 2011 during his Tamil Nadu years. He also held additional charge of Puduchery for a few months. He is the second longest-serving governor in Indian history after Dr. A. R.

<doc id="1148659" wikidata="Q434242" url="?curid=1148659" title="Carl Barât">
<text>Carl Ashley Raphael Barât (; born 6 June 1978) is a British musician best known for being the co-frontman with Pete Doherty of the indie rock band the Libertines. He was the frontman and guitarist of Dirty Pretty Things, and in 2010 debuted a solo studio album. In 2014 he announced the creation of his new band, the Jackals.

==Early life==
Carl Barât was born in Basingstoke, north Hampshire, England, on 6 June 1978, and spent most of his childhood in nearby Whitchurch, Hampshire. In a September 2004 interview with &quot;Blender&quot;, Barât mentioned he is of French, Russian and Polish descent.

As a youth, Barât divided his time between his divorced parents. His father, a former artist, worked in an armaments factory, and his mother, Chrissie, was part of the commune-dwelling counterculture and a member of peace groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Barât spent part of his childhood living with his mother on a commune in Somerset. He has one sister, actress-turned-singer Lucie Barât, who played Helen&#x27;s handmaiden in the 2004 film &quot;Troy&quot;, founded publishing house and artistic organization Little Episodes, and is currently the lead singer of the Au Revoirs. He also has three half-siblings, one step brother and one step sister.

In 1996, Barât was studying for a drama degree at Brunel University at the campus in St. Margarets, Twickenham. Although he dropped out halfway through, during his time he became well-acquainted with Pete Doherty&#x27;s sister, Amy-Jo and through her, Barât met Doherty. They soon developed an intense friendship based on a shared interest in music and songwriting. Barât and Doherty also developed a shared mythology in which they were on a ship called &#x27;The Albion&#x27; sailing to &#x27;Arcadia&#x27;. After both dropped out of university, they formed the Libertines. The band in its final incarnation included bassist John Hassall and drummer Gary Powell. Barât and Doherty were co-frontmen, sharing songwriting, vocal and guitar duties.

==Career==
===The Libertines===

The Libertines&#x27; first album, &quot;Up the Bracket&quot;, was released in 2002 to critical acclaim. The band appeared on the cover of &quot;NME&quot; before the album was released and rapidly rose to fame in the UK. Referring to their relationship in a January 2010 interview, Barât said, &quot;... it&#x27;s a deep love. Deep love does funny things to people&quot;.

In 2003, Doherty&#x27;s addiction to heroin and crack cocaine led Barât to ask him not to participate in the band&#x27;s next tour. When Doherty discovered that the Libertines had left without him to perform in Japan he broke into Barât&#x27;s Mayfair flat and stole various items, including an antique guitar and an NME Award. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison (this sentence was later shortened to two months). Barât warmly welcomed Doherty back to the Libertines on the day of his release, and they later performed an impromptu &quot;Freedom Gig&quot; at the Tap &#x27;n&#x27; Tin club in Chatham, Kent on 8 October 2003. A photograph of the gig, taken by Roger Sargent, adorns the Libertines&#x27; self-titled second album, &quot;The Libertines&quot;, and the cover of Sargent&#x27;s and Anthony Thornton&#x27;s book, &quot;The Libertines Bound Together&quot;.

Doherty&#x27;s drug addiction continued while the band worked on their second album (the aforementioned &quot;The Libertines&quot;) in 2004, which strained his relationship with Barât. Bodyguards were needed in the recording sessions, allegedly to prevent Barât and Doherty from physically assaulting each other (though this is claimed to be an exaggeration of the press in &quot;Bound Together&quot;) and to keep Doherty&#x27;s hangers-on away from him. Before the release of the album in 2004, relations between Barât and Doherty reached a breaking point and Doherty was once again prevented from performing with the band before addressing his addictions. Doherty did not take the ultimatum well, especially as the Libertines continued touring without him to fulfill contractual obligations.

What was intended as a short leave of absence turned into something more permanent, as Doherty formed a new band, Babyshambles, and the Libertines officially disbanded after their final gig in December 2004.

On 15 May 2009, Barât, Doherty and Powell of the Libertines played on stage together for the first time since the split in 2004. The Libertines (minus Denmark-residing bassist John Hassall) came together for a tribute gig for their late promoter, Johnny Sedassy. The six song set, which included &quot;What a Waster&quot;, &quot;Up the Bracket&quot; and &quot;Death on the Stairs&quot;, was played after Babyshambles appeared on stage. Barât said the show was a &#x27;one off&#x27;, although he said more shows could not be ruled out. Barât also expressed his desire to get on stage with Doherty again, although perhaps not until 2010. Powell also confirmed that he would be interested in a full reunion, although he wished to &quot;readdress old ghosts first&quot;.

The Libertines delighted their fans by announcing that year that they would be headline artists at the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals. Their set and the characteristic chemistry between the pair, was for many people one of the highlights of the weekend.

In April 2014 the Libertines announced they would again reform for a show at London&#x27;s Hyde Park. In November 2014 the band signed a record deal with Virgin EMI Records, and released their third album, &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth,&quot; on 11 September 2015, leading to Headline slots at Reading and Leeds, T in the Park as well as a surprise slot at Glastonbury. They toured across 2016 and 2017 finishing with a tour across the seaside.

===Dirty Pretty Things===
On 15 September 2005, it was announced that Barât was forming a new band. His bandmates included former Libertines drummer Gary Powell; Anthony Rossomando, who filled in as guitarist following Doherty&#x27;s departure from the group; and Didz Hammond, formerly of the Cooper Temple Clause, on bass. It was later announced that the band&#x27;s name was &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot;.

The group played their first shows in Italy and Paris, France, in October 2005, before recording their debut album in November 2005 in Los Angeles, California. This was produced by Dave Sardy, who has also worked with Supergrass, the Dandy Warhols, Jet, Marilyn Manson, the Rolling Stones, and Oasis. The album – entitled &quot;Waterloo to Anywhere&quot; – was released on 8 May 2006 in the UK and 8 August 2006 in the US.

Their first studio recorded demo, &quot;Bang Bang You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, was released on their website in the form of a flash video. This song was released as their debut single on 24 April 2006 and reached number 5 in the UK single chart. This coincided with the latter part of their first tour of the United Kingdom, which spanned from 26 February to 24 May 2006. Their debut album, &quot;Waterloo to Anywhere&quot;, was released on 8 May 2006, and reached number 3 in the UK album chart. They have since released &quot;Deadwood&quot; and &quot;Wondering&quot;.

The band were forced to postpone their Real Fits fundraiser gig, which had been set to take place at the London Hackney Round Chapel on 20 June 2008 as Barât was rushed to hospital on 17 June with acute pancreatitis. He was released from hospital on 22 June.

The band released their new single, &quot;Tired of England&quot;, on 23 June 2008, and their album, &quot;Romance at Short Notice&quot;, a week later on 30 June.

Their album failed to chart highly despite heavy touring schedules. Powell wrote in the band&#x27;s message board that it had been a difficult year. On 1 October 2008, Dirty Pretty Things split up, though they finished their final tour which began in Glasgow on 4 October and ended in London on 20 December.

===Solo work and contributions===
In 2005, Barât modelled for clothing brand J. Lindeberg, along with Juliette Lewis.

In 2008, Tim Burgess stated that he and Barât had a supergroup the Chavs and planned to record their debut album in August that year. A release never happened.

Barât toured as a solo artist with Glasvegas, performing with them at Edinburgh&#x27;s Hogmanay celebrations on 31 December 2008, and at the Popscene in San Francisco on 8 January 2009. On 14 January 2009, Barât supported Glasvegas with a solo show during their gig at the Los Angeles Troubadour

Barât played his first headline solo shows on 6 and 7 March 2009 at the Wakefield Escobar. He also played at the KU Bar in Stockton-on-Tees on 8 March. 
On 9 June 2009, Barât debuted two new songs, &quot;So Long&quot; and &quot;Monday Morning&quot; at a solo show at Dunfermline&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. On 2 September, Barât confirmed his intentions to release a solo album. Barât also produced the debut EP &quot;Scapegoat&quot; of London-based singer-songwriter Kieran Leonard which was released in October 2009.

He released his &quot;self-titled&quot;, first solo album on 4 October 2010. In an interview with C.B.Liddell of Metropolis magazine he described the album as &quot;the first album I&#x27;ve done that is kind of introspective rather than escapist.&quot;
In the same interview, he also talked about &quot;stepping away from big loud guitars&quot; as the album is stylistically more diverse and less rock-oriented than previous work.
The release of Barât&#x27;s first solo album also coincided with the release of &quot;Threepenny Memoir: The Lives of a Libertine&quot;, an autobiography documenting his years in The Libertines and Dirty Pretty Things.

In January 2013 Barât announced that guitarist Johnny Marr (formerly of the Smiths) and drummer Andy Burrows (formerly of Razorlight and We Are Scientists) would feature on his second solo album, due for release in 2013. Barât revealed demo versions of tracks &#x27;War of the Roses&#x27; and &#x27;Victory Gin&#x27; from his second solo effort online.
Also in 2013, Barât wrote the track &quot;The dark, it comes&quot; for French singer Vanessa Paradis&#x27; album &quot;Love Songs,&quot; on which they duet.

He is part of the supergroup The Bottletop Band with Matt Helders (Arctic Monkeys), Andy Nicholson (Arctic Monkeys), Drew McConnell (Babyshambles) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals). The band&#x27;s single, &quot;The Fall of Rome&quot;, was released in December 2010.

In 2014, Barât contributed the song &quot;Love Is Not on Trial&quot;, co-written with Davey Ray Moor, for Marc Almond&#x27;s album &quot;The Dancing Marquis&quot;. He also contributed vocals and guitar to the track.

===Carl Barât and the Jackals===
In August 2013, Barât announced that his second solo album was complete and he had finished recording it with Joby Ford of the Bronx. He expressed that it was a return to guitar orientated rock stating &quot;It would seem that my relationship with my guitar is all patched up.&quot; Later he said that he wouldn&#x27;t release the new material until he&#x27;d formed a new band.

In early 2014, Barât announced that he would search for a new band online via Facebook. From over 1000 applications for the positions of rhythm guitarist, drummer and bass guitar, Billy Tessio, Jay Bone and Adam Claxton were chosen, respectively. The band was named the Jackals, and their first live concert was on 15 May 2014 in London&#x27;s XOYO. On 16 February 2015, Barât&#x27;s previously recorded material was released through Cooking Vinyl with small changes, as the debut album of Carl Barât and The Jackals under the title &quot;Let It Reign&quot;. It has a score of 67 on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Acting and TV===

In 2005, Barât and his friend, Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches appeared in a documentary following the pair on a night out in London.

On 7 July 2006, Barât announced that he would become the fifth mentor in the Road to V competition, which involved a UK search for the best unsigned music talent in the UK, with the winner opening V Festival in either Chelmsford or Staffordshire.

In 2008, he acted in the British film &quot;Telstar,&quot; in the role of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer Gene Vincent. The film premiered at the London Film Festival on 25 October 2008 and was released on 19 June 2009. He also featured in an advertisement for BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Culture Show&quot;, being asked about British culture. A longer version of his interview can be found on the Culture Show website.

In May 2009 Barât featured as himself in a pilot episode for &quot;Svengali&quot;, alongside former manager Alan McGee and Welsh actor Jonathan Owen, and went on to appear as himself in the film version of &quot;Svengali&quot; (2013), directed by John Hardwick. On 25 August 2009, a short video entitled &quot;Two British Dudes&quot; featuring Barât and fellow musician Har Mar Superstar was released on crappyholidays.net.

In January 2010, he appeared in the stage play &quot;Fool For Love&quot; alongside actress Sadie Frost. The play ran until March 2010 at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London.
Barât also narrated a new artist documentary, Mark Donne&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Modern Mariner&quot;. The film had its world premiere at St Anne&#x27;s Church in Limehouse, East London, during the ninth East End Film Festival. Barât&#x27;s former Dirty Pretty Things bandmate Anthony Rossomando composed the score for the film.

Barât made his opera debut in 2012, as Nero in &quot;Pop&#x27;pea&quot; at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris; the show was a rock adaptation of &quot;Il Nerone&quot;. In the same year he played the role of Gavin Metcalf in Dan Turner&#x27;s film &quot;The Man Inside,&quot; and had a cameo appearance on the BBC Three TV series &quot;Dead Boss&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Barât underwent surgery to remove a tumour behind his ear and spent several weeks recovering from the operation. The tumour and resulting surgery left him partially deaf.

Barât&#x27;s girlfriend, Edie Langley, gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a boy named Eli on 9 December 2010. Their second son, Ramone, was born on 26 August 2014. Barât lives with his family in Margate, Kent.

<text>John Hassall is an English musician, best known as the bassist for the Libertines. He performs with his own band the April Rainers. Previously, he formed the band Yeti.

==Early life==
He has said that when he discovered The Beatles at age 13 was the first time he fell in love. He went on to buy their entire discography in chronological order.

==The Libertines==
Hassall attended Highgate School, where he was classmates with Johnny Borrell of Razorlight, and then Camden School for Girls at sixth form. It is reported Borrell was actually part of the band&#x27;s line up as bass player before Hassall; another band member was quoted saying he left because he could not keep up with a song they were practising (allegedly &#x27;Horrorshow&#x27;, a song from the band&#x27;s Up The Bracket – their first album). Hassall joined a band and ended up playing bass. He played in various bands for a few years, but none of them worked out until he met Pete Doherty. Doherty and Carl Barât had already founded the Libertines, but were in need of a bassist and drummer. It is said that Doherty was intrigued by Hassall not only for his talent but because he had &#x27;proper&#x27; equipment. To play the drums on their first recording session, the trio hired Paul Dufour. Hassall was hired to rejoin them on bass when they were signed by Rough Trade in late 2001. He continued to play with the band until they disbanded at the end of 2004. The band has since reformed and was a &quot;Special Guest&quot; at the Reading/Leeds Festival on 28 August 2010.

From 2015 to 2020, John Hassall toured with the Libertines, promoting their third LP: Anthems for Doomed Youth. In the deluxe version of the album, there&#x27;s a song called Over It Again where Hassall acts as the lead singer.

Hassall formed a new band, The April Rainers in Aarhus Denmark, where he lives with his Danish wife Line Hassall Thomsen. After a number of Scandinavian gigs and support slots on Pete Doherty&#x27;s Eudaimonia tour, the Rainers played a series of headlining gigs in England. The band&#x27;s much delayed debut album &quot;Wheels to Idyll&quot; was released in March 2017, following single releases and videos for &quot;Given Time&quot;,&quot;Intercity 125&quot;, &quot;Whether Girl&quot; and &quot;Mosey Through Your Mind&quot;, the latter being directed by Libertines collaborator Roger Sargent.

<text>Dennis Allen Mitchell (born February 20, 1966) is an American former college and international track and field athlete, who was a member of the gold medal-winning team in the 4 x 100 meters relay race at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Athletics career==
Mitchell was born in Havelock, North Carolina. Raised in Winslow Township, New Jersey, he graduated in 1984 from Edgewood Regional High School.

He received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he ran for the Florida Gators track and field team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 1986 to 1989. At Florida, Mitchell was coached by Joe Walker. Mitchell placed fourth in the 100 meters race at the 1988 Summer Olympics and missed a probable gold medal in the 4 x 100 meters relay race, because the American team was disqualified in the early heats, after the baton pass between teammates Calvin Smith and Lee McNeill was completed outside the exchange zone. In 1989, Mitchell won the NCAA championships in 200 meters race, and he was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2005.

In 1991, just a month before the World Championships, Mitchell set his first world record in the 4 x 100 meters relay of 37.67 at Zürich. At the World Championships, Mitchell was again a member of the American 4 x 100 meters relay team, in which he set a new world record of 37.50 in the final. Mitchell also won a bronze medal in the individual 100 meters race, just 0.01 seconds shy of the world record.

In 1992, Mitchell won his first United States National Championships title in the 100 meters (he repeated this victory in 1994 and 1996). At the Barcelona Olympics, Mitchell ran his third world record in 4 x 100 meters relay of 37.40 and won again a bronze medal in the 100 meters race.

At the 1993 World Championships, Mitchell won his third bronze at the international championships in individual 100 meters and his third gold in relay event with a world record, as this time the American team equaled their own world record of 37.40.

Mitchell won a gold medal in 100 meters at the 1994 Goodwill Games, but injured himself in the heats of 100 -meters at the 1995 World Championships. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Mitchell was fourth in 100-meters and won a silver medal as a member of the second-place U.S. 4x100-meters relay team.

His personal best for the 100 metres was 9.91 seconds, set in Tokyo on 25 August 1991 in the World Athletics Championships final.

==Personal life==
Mitchell is married to Damu Cherry-Mitchell, an Olympian in the 100-meter hurdles, and has four children. He coaches his own club, Star Athletics, in Montverde, Florida. He has trained world class athletes including Sha&#x27;Carri Richardson, Kenny Bednarek, Justin Gatlin, Aaron Brown, Kaylin Whitney, Javianne Oliver, and Twanisha Terry, among others.

==Doping history==
In 1998, Mitchell was banned by International Association of Athletics Federations for two years after a test showed high levels of testosterone. They did not accept his defense of &quot;five bottles of beer and sex with his wife at least four times... it was her birthday, the lady deserved a treat.&quot; Mitchell made his final international appearance at the 2001 World Championships, where his team finished first in the 4 x 100 meters relay, but was subsequently disqualified because of BALCO scandal involvement by a teammate.

On May 1, 2008, it was announced that the U.S. government, in its trial against Trevor Graham, would have Mitchell, as well as Antonio Pettigrew as witnesses, with Mitchell to testify that Graham injected him with human growth hormone.

<doc id="1148670" wikidata="Q1033756" url="?curid=1148670" title="Nor'west arch">
<text>The nor&#x27;west arch is a band of high white lenticular cloud that forms on the eastern side of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island and which looks like an arch in an otherwise clear blue sky over the Southern Alps. It is accompanied by a strong hot northwesterly or northerly wind known as a &quot;nor&#x27;wester&quot;. In Canterbury, where it is a well known feature, it is also called the Canterbury arch. It also occurs in Otago and Marlborough and east of mountain ranges along the east coast of the North Island.

Closer to the Canterbury coast, some distance from the mountains of the Southern Alps, it appears as a clear area of blue above the mountains, with white cloud streaming to the east from it. The phenomenon is similar to the Chinook arch seen in the Pacific regions of the United States and Canada.

==Formation==
The nor&#x27;west arch is a föhn cloud or a lenticular cloud. The northwesterly wind drives warm moist air from over the Tasman Sea, and it is pushed up by the presence of the Southern Alps, causing it to cool rapidly. The area to the east of the divide is in the rain shadow of the Alps; much of the moisture is dumped on the West Coast, and is responsible for the temperate rainforests found there. As the air passes over the alps, the water vapour remaining becomes visible in a band of cloud over the mountains at the top of each wave of air. From the perspective of a viewer on the eastern side, this appears as an &#x27;arch&#x27; of cloud. The standing wave or arch is caused by the moisture condensing and becoming visible towards the top of the wave and then evaporating again as the air descends to the trough of the wave.

Nor&#x27;westers caused by cold fronts will often change within a day or two to a cool southerly wind accompanied by rain showers, as the front passes through. In mid-winter, a nor&#x27;wester is often followed by a brief but intense cold snap, frequently bringing thunder, hail, or rain and sometimes snow which may settle to sea level.

==Occurrence==
The nor&#x27;west arch can be seen as far north as Amberley and as far south as Central Otago, but it is at its most prominent on the Canterbury Plains, due to the flat and low-lying nature of the land to the east of the mountains.

The nor&#x27;wester can blow at any time of year, but is less common in winter. Many of the strongest northerly and northwesterly winds blow ahead of cold fronts. A front lying across the South Island will often extend from northwest to southeast, reaching northern parts of the West Coast before it reaches corresponding areas on the east coast. The steep air pressure gradient ahead of the cyclonic system associated with a front gives these nor&#x27;westers their strength; they will commonly reach gale force and cause isolated damage to trees and buildings. Once every few years, a nor&#x27;wester will approach hurricane strength and cause widespread damage.

==Effects==
The heat and lack of moisture characteristic of nor&#x27;westers play a major role in the intermittent droughts experienced by Canterbury and other regions on New Zealand&#x27;s eastern coasts. The nor&#x27;wester has a deep psychological effect on many people subjected to its hot, dry nature. It has been statistically linked to increases in suicide and domestic violence.

<doc id="1148672" wikidata="Q531507" url="?curid=1148672" title="Micronutrient">
<text>Micronutrients are essential elements required by organisms in small quantities to perform various biogeochemical processes and regulate physiological functions of cells and organs. By enabling these processes, micronutrients support the health of organisms throughout life.

For humans, vitamins and dietary minerals are the primary micronutrients. Human micronutrient requirements are in amounts generally less than 100 milligrams per day, whereas macronutrients are required in gram quantities daily. Deficiencies in micronutrient intake commonly result in malnutrition.
Micronutrient abundance in the environment greatly influences biogeochemical cycles at the microbial level which large ecological communities rely on to survive. For example, marine primary producers are reliant upon bioavailable dissolved iron for photosynthesis. Secondary and tertiary producers in oceans are therefore also reliant on the presence of sufficient dissolved iron concentrations.

== Inadequate micronutrient intake in humans ==
Inadequate intake of essential nutrients predisposes humans to various chronic diseases, with some 50% of American adults having one or more preventable disease. In the United States, foods poor in micronutrient content and high in food energy make up some 27% of daily calorie intake. One US national survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006) found that persons with high sugar intake consumed fewer micronutrients, especially vitamins A, C, and E, and magnesium.

A 1994 report by the World Bank estimated that micronutrient malnutrition costs developing economies at least 5 percent of gross domestic product. The Asian Development Bank has summarized the benefits of eliminating micronutrient deficiencies as follows:

Along with a growing understanding of the extent and impact of micronutrient malnutrition, several interventions have demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of correction and prevention. Distributing inexpensive capsules, diversifying to include more micronutrient-rich foods, or fortifying commonly consumed foods can make an enormous difference. Correcting iodine, vitamin A, and iron deficiencies can improve the population-wide intelligence quotient by 10–15 points, reduce maternal deaths by one-fourth, decrease infant and child mortality by 40 percent, and increase people&#x27;s work capacity by almost half. The elimination of these deficiencies will reduce health care and education costs, improve work capacity and productivity, and accelerate equitable economic
growth and national development. Improved nutrition is essential to sustain economic growth. Micronutrient deficiency elimination is as cost-effective as the best public health interventions and fortification is the most cost-effective strategy.

===Salt iodization===
Salt iodization is a major strategy for addressing iodine deficiency, which is a major cause of mental health problems. In 1990, less than 20 percent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt. By 1994, international partnerships had formed in a global campaign for Universal Salt Iodization. By 2008, it was estimated that 72 percent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt, and the number of countries in which iodine deficiency disorders were a public health concern reduced by more than half from 110 to 47 countries.

===Vitamin A supplementation===
Vitamin A deficiency is a major factor in causing blindness worldwide, particularly among children. Global vitamin A supplementation efforts have targeted 103 priority countries. In 1999, 16 percent of children in these countries received two annual doses of vitamin A. By 2007, the rate increased to 62 percent.

Fortification of staple foods with vitamin A has uncertain benefits on reducing the risk of subclinical vitamin A deficiency.

===Zinc===
Fortification of staple foods may improve serum zinc levels in the population. Other effects such as improving zinc deficiency, children&#x27;s growth, cognition, work capacity of adults, or blood indicators are unknown. Experiments show that soil and foliar application of zinc fertilizer can effectively reduce the phytate zinc ratio in grain. People who eat bread prepared from zinc-enriched wheat show a significant increase in serum zinc, suggesting that the zinc fertilizer strategy is a promising approach to address zinc deficiencies in humans.

==Plant micronutrient needs==
Plants tend not to use vitamins, although minerals are required.
Some seven trace elements are essential to plant growth, although often in trace quantities.

*Boron is believed to be involved in carbohydrate transport in plants; it also assists in metabolic regulation. Boron deficiency will often result in bud dieback.
*Chloride is necessary for osmosis and ionic balance; it also plays a role in photosynthesis.
*Copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc are cofactors essential for the functioning of many enzymes. For plants, deficiency in these elements often results in inefficient production of chlorophyll, manifested in chlorosis.

<doc id="1148673" wikidata="Q340193" url="?curid=1148673" title="HMS Defence (1907)">
<text>HMS &quot;Defence&quot; was a armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century, the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy. She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser and light cruiser . The ship was transferred to the Grand Fleet in January 1915 and remained there for the rest of her career.

&quot;Defence&quot; was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the war. Escorting the main body of the Grand Fleet, the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she attempted to engage a disabled German light cruiser. She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine. The fire from that explosion spread to the ship&#x27;s secondary magazines, which exploded in turn. The entire crew are believed to have been killed, although newspapers of the time made unverified claims of possible survivors.

==Description==

&quot;Defence&quot; displaced as built and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a mean draught of . She was powered by a pair of four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 24 Yarrow water-tube boilers. The ship carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . &quot;Defence&quot; was designed to carry 779 officers and men.

The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of four BL 9.2-inch Mark X guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament of ten BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns were mounted amidships in single turrets. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by sixteen QF 12-pounder (three-inch) 18-cwt guns. &quot;Defence&quot; also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch torpedo tubes, one of which was mounted in the stern.

The waterline belt consisted of of Krupp cemented armour roughly between the fore and aft 7.5-inch gun turrets, but was reduced in steps to three inches to the ends of the ship. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour. The thickness of the lower deck was . The armour of the conning tower was thick.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Defence&quot; was ordered as part of the 1904–05 naval construction programme as the last of three armoured cruisers. She was laid down on 22 February 1905 at the Royal Dockyard in Pembroke Dock, Wales. She was christened on 27 April 1907 by Lady Cawdor and commissioned on 3 February 1909 at the cost of £1,362,970. The ship was briefly assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet until she was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when the Home Fleet reorganised on 23 March 1909. Three months later &quot;Defence&quot; was reassigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron. She escorted the ocean liner in 1911–1912 while the latter ship served as the royal yacht for the newly crowned King George V&#x27;s trip to India to attend the Delhi Durbar. After the ship returned to Plymouth in early 1912, &quot;Defence&quot; was transferred to the China Station, where she remained until December when she was ordered to rejoin the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean as flagship.
At the start of the First World War, she was involved in the pursuit of the German warships &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;, but Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge decided not to engage &quot;Goeben&quot; due to the latter&#x27;s more powerful guns, heavier armour and faster speed. She then blockaded the German ships inside the Dardanelles until the ship was ordered on 10 September to the South Atlantic to take part in the hunt for Admiral Graf von Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron. The order was cancelled on 14 September when it became clear that the German squadron was still in the Eastern Pacific and &quot;Defence&quot; returned to the Dardanelles. The Admiralty again ordered the ship to the South Atlantic in October to join Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock&#x27;s squadron searching for the German ships. &quot;Defence&quot;, however, had only reached Montevideo, Uruguay by 3 November 1914 when she received word that most of Admiral Cradock&#x27;s squadron had been destroyed two days previously at the Battle of Coronel. The ship rendezvoused with the battlecruisers and later that month and transferred her long-range radio equipment to &quot;Invincible&quot; before sailing to South Africa to escort a troop convoy to Great Britain. &quot;Defence&quot; departed Table Bay, Cape Town on 8 December and rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet as its flagship upon her arrival.

&quot;Defence&quot; received a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47 mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun was mounted on the aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear.

During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Arbuthnot, leading the First Cruiser Squadron. The squadron formed the starboard flank of the cruiser screen, ahead of the main body of the Grand Fleet. &quot;Defence&quot; was just to the right of the centre of the line. At 17:47, &quot;Defence&quot; and , the leading two ships of the squadron, spotted the German II Scouting Group and opened fire. Their shells fell short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser , which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. Shortly afterwards, they spotted the disabled German light cruiser and closed to engage. When the two ships reached a range of from &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; they were spotted in turn at 18:05 by the German battlecruiser and four battleships which were less than away. The fire from the German ships was heavy and &quot;Defence&quot; was hit by two salvoes from the German ships that caused the aft 9.2-inch magazine to explode. The resulting fire spread via the ammunition passages to the adjacent 7.5-inch magazines which detonated in turn. The ship exploded at 18:20 with the loss of all hands; between 893 and 903 men were killed.

==&quot;Defence&quot; today==
At the time, it was believed that &quot;Defence&quot; had been reduced to fragments by the explosion, but the wreck was discovered in mid-1984 by Clive Cussler and a NUMA survey of the North Sea and English Channel at coordinates . It was dived upon in 2001 by a team led by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney and found to be largely intact, despite the violence of her sinking. &quot;Defence&quot;, along with the other Jutland wrecks, was belatedly declared a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, to discourage further damage to the resting place of approximately 900 men.

<text>The Vulcan Foundry Limited was an English locomotive builder sited at Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire (now Merseyside).

==History==
The Vulcan Foundry opened in 1832, as Charles Tayleur and Company to produce girders for bridges, switches, crossings and other ironwork following the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Due to the distance from the locomotive works in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, it seemed preferable to build and support them locally. In 1832, Robert Stephenson became a partner for a few years. The company had become The Vulcan Foundry Company in 1847 and acquired limited liability in 1864. From the beginning of 1898, the name changed again to The Vulcan Foundry Limited, dropping the word &#x27;company.&#x27;

===Vulcan Halt===
The site had its own railway station, Vulcan Halt, on the former Warrington and Newton Railway line from to . The wooden-platformed halt was opened on 1 November 1916 by the London and North Western Railway, and closed on 12 June 1965.

==Steam locomotives==
Details of the earliest locomotives are not precisely known despite an &quot;official&quot; list apparently concocted in the 1890s which contains a lot of guesswork and invention, with many quite fictitious locomotives, for the period before 1845. This list claims that the first two locomotives were 0-4-0 &quot;Tayleur&quot; and &quot;Stephenson&quot; built in 1833 for &quot;Mr Hargreaves, Bolton&quot;, but this seems unlikely. The earliest authenticated products were 0-4-0 &quot;Titan&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot;, similar to Stephenson&#x27;s design, and delivered in September and October 1834 to the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway. Other early orders came from the Leicester and Swannington Railway and there were also some 4-2-0s for America which were among the first British &#x27;bogie&#x27; locomotives.

From 1835 the company was selling to Belgium, France, and in 1836 to Austria and Russia, the beginnings of an export trade which was maintained throughout the life of the company. The company&#x27;s locomotives had a strong Stephenson influence, many during the following decade being of the &quot;long boiler&quot; design. In 1852 the first locomotives ever to run in India were supplied to the Great Indian Peninsula Railway.

A number of Fairlie locomotives were built, including &quot;Taliesin&quot; for the Ffestiniog Railway, &quot;Mountaineer&quot; for the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway, and &quot;Josephine&quot; one of the NZR E class (1872). During 1870 the company supplied the first locomotive to run in Japan, and a flangeless 0-4-0T for a steelworks in Tredegar which was still using angle rails. A number of Matthew Kirtley&#x27;s double-framed goods engines were also produced for the Midland Railway. In c.1911, following a report by the Locomotive Committee on Standard Locomotives for Indian Railways which was published in 1910, North-Western Railway, a regional railway at that time operated by the Indian State Railway, ordered eleven broad gauge locomotives, measuring 5 feet 6 inches between the rails, favoured because it allowed the engineers designing the locomotives to build larger fireboxes and boilers, enabling the engines to pull longer and heavier loads.

The healthy export trade continued, particularly to India and South America, and continued after World War I.

Following the formation of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 some very large orders were received, including over a hundred LMS Fowler Class 3F 0-6-0T engines and seventy-five LMS Compound 4-4-0 locomotives.

The most notable design manufactured for an overseas railway during this period was the large 4-8-4 built for the Chinese National Railways in 1934–35. These fine locomotives were equipped with a mechanical stoker and six of them were fitted with booster engines on the tender, providing an extra tractive effort. Of the 24 exported, one returned to the UK and is preserved at the National Railway Museum in York.

Through the 1930s the company survived the trade recessions with the aid of more orders from India, some from Tanganyika and Argentina, and a large order in 1934 from the LMS for 4-6-0 &quot;Black Fives&quot; and 2-8-0 Stanier-designed locomotives.

During 1953-54 the company built sixty J class 2-8-0 locomotives for the Victorian Railways in Australia.

==Second World War==
From 1939 the works was mostly concerned with the war effort, becoming involved in the development and production of the Matilda II tank. From 1943 large orders were received from the Ministry of Supply for locomotives, 390 Austerity 2-8-0s and fifty Austerity 0-6-0 saddle tanks.

In 1944 the Vulcan Foundry acquired Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns and in 1945 received an order for 120 &quot;Liberation&quot; 2-8-0 locomotives for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Europe.

The war had left India&#x27;s railways in a parlous state and in 1947, with foreign aid, embarked on a massive rebuilding plan. The Vulcan Foundry benefited from orders for XE, XD, and YD 2-8-2s; and ten WG 2-8-2s sub-contracted from the North British Locomotive Company, but the writing was on the wall for all British manufacturers. Not only was the competition fierce from other countries, but India had developed the ability to build its own locomotives.

==Diesel and electric locomotives==


The company had experience of both diesel and electric locomotives, having built thirty-one so-called &quot;Crocodile&quot; 2600 hp 1,500 V DC electric freight locomotives in 1929 for India. These were classified as EF/1 which after Indian independence became the WCG-1 class. India&#x27;s National Rail Museum, New Delhi exhibits an WCG-1 locomotive from the Vulcan foundry. They also helped in supply of the WCM-1 and WCM-2 class.

In 1931, the company supplied the first experimental diesel shunter to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In 1936, &quot;Vulcan&quot;, a diesel-mechanical 0-6-0 shunter with a Vulcan-Frichs 6-cylinder 275 hp (205 kW) diesel engine was loaned to the LMS, and was then used by the War Department, which numbered it 75 (later 70075). Following the end of World War II, it found industrial use in Yugoslavia.

In 1938, ten diesel railcars were ordered by New Zealand Railways, the NZR RM class (Vulcan). They were supplied in 1940, although one was lost at sea to enemy action. In 1948, it supplied 10 Class 15 Diesel Electric shunters to Malayan Railways, as well as twenty Class 20 Diesel Electric locomotives for the same company nine years later.

The works has produced many locomotives for both domestic and foreign railways. It was a major supplier of diesel-electrics to British Railways notably the Class 55 &quot;Deltic&quot;. The works also developed a prototype gas turbine locomotive, the British Rail GT3. Other classes of diesel locomotives to be built for British Railways at the Vulcan Foundry included: Class 20, Class 37, Class 40 and Class 50. Electric locomotives were also built for British Rail by Vulcan Foundry, which included many Class 86s in 1965 and 1966.

In the mid-1950s, negotiations began to sell the company. In 1957, the purchase was finalised and the business became part of the English Electric group.

Although the works still produced diesel engines under name Ruston Paxman Diesels Limited, which had been moved from Lincoln, locomotive manufacturing finished in 1970. Output was mainly for marine and stationary applications, but the company was the supplier of choice for British Rail Engineering Limited for locomotives built at Doncaster and Crewe.
==Sale and closure==
The factory passed through various hands as English Electric was bought by GEC, which in turn became GEC Alsthom (later renamed Alstom) and finally as part of MAN Diesel in 2000. At the end of 2002, the works closed. It was then an industrial estate, appropriately called &quot;Vulcan Industrial Estate&quot;. The site is just north of Winwick Junction, where the line to Newton-le-Willows branches off to the west from the West Coast Main Line. All the former factory buildings on the site were demolished in October 2007 however, the workers cottages, known as &quot;Vulcan Village&quot;, still survive at the southern corner of the site. By early 2010, work had started on the construction of 630 homes on the levelled site by the developer St Modwen.

<doc id="1148678" wikidata="Q6029016" url="?curid=1148678" title="Infanticide Act">
<text>The Infanticide Act is the name of two 20th-century acts in English law that started treating the killing of an infant child by its mother during the early months of life as a lesser crime than murder.

==England and Wales==

The Infanticide Act 1922 (12 &amp; 13 Geo. 5. c. 18) effectively abolished the death penalty for a woman who deliberately killed her newborn child, while the balance of her mind was disturbed as a result of giving birth, by providing a partial defence to murder. The sentence that applies (as in other partial defences to murder) is the same as that for manslaughter. This act was repealed by section 2(3) of the Infanticide Act 1938.

The Infanticide Act 1938 extended this defence to cases where &quot;at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child.&quot;

Before the partial murder defence of diminished responsibility became part of English law in the Homicide Act 1957, and other than referral for possible insanity, this provided the main means of lenient sentencing for a mother found guilty of deliberate killing of her infant. Such women would otherwise face a mandatory life sentence or death sentence for murder.

In the 21st century, it has become common for a severely post-natally depressed mother who kills her infant child to not receive a prison sentence, except in exceptional circumstances. As of 2019, where a less extreme or no condition is suffered by the mother, then causing or allowing a child under 15 to die (under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, s.5) carries an effective sentence recommendation of 1 to 14 years&#x27; custody, unless the seven influential steps of sentencing determine otherwise. Where an offender&#x27;s responsibility is substantially reduced by mental disorder, learning disability or lack of maturity, the lowest of three culpabilities applies, namely, &quot;lesser culpability&quot;, and the starting point is 2 years in custody, with a possible range of 1 to 4 years&#x27; custody.

In a report, the terms of which were agreed on 1 November 2006, the Law Commission recognised the difficulties facing the court when a defendant is in denial and unwilling to submit to psychiatric examination, as she perceives the purpose of such examination as an attempt to prove her guilt. In such cases, the mother is unlikely to have any other defence and is therefore more likely to be convicted of murder or causing a child to die.

==Northern Ireland==
The Infanticide Act (Northern Ireland) 1939 makes similar arrangements for Northern Ireland.

==Canada==
The English Infanticide Acts also formed the basis for similar legislation in Canadian criminal law, which was enacted via an amendment to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; in 1948. It is still in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and has not been updated since its enactment in 1948. It is an indictable offence, and carries a penalty of imprisonment not exceeding five years.

<doc id="1148679" wikidata="Q593621" url="?curid=1148679" title="Daniel Buren">
<text>Daniel Buren (born 25 March 1938, in Boulogne-Billancourt) is a French conceptual artist, painter, and sculptor. He has won numerous awards including the Golden Lion for best pavilion at the Venice Biennale (1986), the International Award for best artist in Stuttgart (1991) and the prestigious Premium Imperiale for painting in Tokyo in 2007. He has created several world-famous installations, including &quot;Les Deux Plateaux&quot;(1985) in the Cour d&#x27;honneur of the Palais-Royal, and the Observatory of the Light in Fondation Louis Vuitton. He is one of the most active and recognised artists on the international scene, and his work has been welcomed by the most important institutions and sites around the world.

== Work ==
Sometimes classified as a Minimalist, Buren is known best for using regular, contrasting colored stripes in an effort to integrate visual surface and architectural space, notably on historical, landmark architecture.

Among his primary concerns is the &quot;scene of production&quot; as a way of presenting art and highlighting facture (the process of &#x27;making&#x27; rather than for example, mimesis or representation of anything but the work itself). The work is site-specific installation, having a relation to its setting in contrast to prevailing ideas of an autonomous work of art.

=== Early work ===
He graduated from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Métiers d&#x27;Art in Paris, in 1960. He began painting in the early 1960s. However, by 1965 – a year he spent in the Grapetree Bay Hotel on the Caribbean island of Saint Croix where he was contracted to make frescoes – he had abandoned traditional painting for the 8.7 cm-wide vertical stripes, which alternated between white and one color, which have become his signature. Working on-site, he strives to contextualise his artistic practice using the stripe – a popular French fabric motif – as a means of visually relating art to its situation, a form of language in space rather than a space in itself. Denoting the trademark stripes as a visual instrument or &quot;seeing tool,&quot; he invites viewers to take up his critical standpoint challenging traditional ideas about art.

He began producing unsolicited public art works using striped awning canvas common in France: he started by setting up hundreds of striped posters, so-called &quot;affichages sauvages&quot;, around Paris and later in more than 100 Metro stations, drawing public attention through these unauthorised bandit-style acts. In June 1970 he put stripes on the front and back of Los Angeles bus benches without permission. In another controversial gesture he blocked the entrance of the gallery with stripes of his first solo exhibition. Expanding on this idea, in 1971 he created a six-foot banner, &quot;Peinture-Sculpture&quot;, to divide the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s rotunda in New York. For his first New York City solo show in 1973, Buren suspended a set of nineteen black and white striped squares of canvas on a cable that ran from one end of the John Weber Gallery to the other, out the window to a building on the other side of West Broadway and back. Nine pieces were inside the gallery and nine outside; a middle piece, which connected the outside and the inside parts of the installation, was placed half-in and half-out in the opening where the window frame had been removed for the duration of the exhibition. In 1977 Buren cut up one of his artworks from 1969 and made a new work, designating that the sections should hang in the corners of a wall, whether that wall was empty, had doors or windows, or even had other artworks already hanging on it.
As a conceptual artist, Buren was regarded as visually and spatially audacious, objecting to traditional ways of presenting art through the museum-gallery system while at the same time growing in hot demand to show via the same system. In the late 1960s he connected to the ideas of space and presentation arising through deconstructionist philosophies that had as their background the May 1968 student demonstrations in France. Between 1966 and 1967, he joined forces with fellow artists Olivier Mosset, Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni to form the BMPT, whose intention was to reduce paintings to the most basic physical and visual elements through the systematic repetition of motifs.

Often referred to as &quot;the stripe guy,&quot; Buren also expresses his theme in paint, laser cut fabric, light boxes, transparent fabrics and ceramic cup sets. His stripes are displayed in private homes, public places, and museums worldwide. Since the 1950s he has amassed some 400,000 of what he calls &quot;photos-souvenirs&quot;, documenting his work and travels around the globe.

=== Installations ===
From 1960 on, Buren designed a number of permanent site-specific installations in the United States, Belgium, France, and Germany. In 1986 he created a 3,000-square-meter sculpture in the great courtyard of the Palais Royal, in Paris: &quot;Les Deux Plateaux&quot;, more commonly referred to as the &quot;Colonnes de Buren&quot; (&quot;Buren&#x27;s Columns&quot;). This provoked an intense debate over the integration of contemporary art and historic buildings. In 1993, Buren was commissioned to design the work in situ, &quot;Poser/Déposer/Exposer,&quot; for the Café Richelieu at the Louvre in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Raynaud.

Since the 1990s, Buren&#x27;s work has become more architectural. He creates new spaces within existing environments such as city centers (&quot;A Colored Square in the Sky&quot;, 2007), public parks (&quot;La Cabane Éclatée aux 4 Salles&quot;, 2005), entire museums (&quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot;, 2005), and even beaches (&quot;&quot;, 2009). For &quot;Green and White Fence&quot; (1999/2001) Buren installed a functional fence sculpture, consisting of fence posts at four-meter intervals, painted green and white 87-millimeter stripes along a single ridge line: Since the first part&#x27;s installation, the artist&#x27;s theme has been extended until, over time, it will become the only form of fence on Gibbs Farm in New Zealand. In 2004, for the occasion of the opening of the French cultural year in China, Buren exhibited in his in situ installation &quot;De l&#x27;azur au Temple du Ciel&quot; (From the sky to Temple of Heaven) at Temple of Heaven in Beijing. &quot;A Rainbow in the Sky&quot; (2009) consisted of thousands of colorful pennant flags hovering over a busy pedestrian square in Pasadena, California for two months.

Buren collaborated with Hermès on a number of occasions. The artist inaugurated Hermès&#x27; contemporary art gallery La Verrière in Brussels in 2000 by transforming its walls with bold graphics, colours and his trademark stripes, and later opened the Atelier Hermès in Dosan Park, Seoul with his &quot;Filtres colorés&quot;, coloured panels that diffused the light to dramatic effect. In 2010, he created &quot;Photo souvenirs au carré&quot;, a 365 limited-edition line of scarves decorated with silk-printed photographs.

In 2009 Buren collaborated with the collective Ensemble(s) La Ligne created by RCP Design Global agency, with, among others, Louis Dandrel and Roger Tallon to create &quot;Curseur&quot; (2009–2013). It is a work in situ – for Tours Tram – three black and white stripes vertically, which will join the same horizontal marking on the ground, both at right angles to the doors&#x27; opening. Trainsets shaped cursor with &quot;mirror effect&quot; identified in black and white s.

In 2014, the rooftop of Modernist architect Le Corbusier&#x27;s Cité Radieuse building in Marseilles hosted an installation of mirrors and coloured glass by Buren. &quot;Défini, Fini, Infini&quot; (2014) was an installation for the Marseilles Modulor (MaMo), led by French designer Ora-Ïto, who in 2013 transformed the iconic rooftop into an international arts space.

In 2017, Buren completed his first permanent installation in the United Kingdom, &#x27;Diamonds and Circles&#x27; permanent works &#x27;in situ&#x27;, a work for Art on the Underground on the walls of the expanded ticket hall at Tottenham Court Road.

=== Performance ===
From 1966 to &#x27;67, Buren and the other BMPT artists staged a series of performances they called &quot;manifestations&quot;, in which the group made or exhibited their work in public as a critical encounter with audiences.

&quot;Voile/Toile – Toile/Voile&quot;, a piece consisting of boat races followed by museum displays of sail-canvasses, was originally created for a regatta on the Wannsee, Berlin, in 1975 and later produced in Geneva (1979), Lucerne (1980), Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq (1983), Lyon-Villeurbanne (1998), Tel Aviv (1999), Sevilla (2004), and Grasmere (2005). This work always has two separate parts. In the first, nine Optimists are fitted with striped canvas sails (white with red, blue, yellow, green or brown stripes). The two white stripes at the edges are covered with white paint. The boats then race in a regatta. In the second part, after the race, the sails are exhibited in a museum in the city where the regatta was held. They are presented in the order they crossed the finishing line, from one to nine and from left to right, as befits the exhibition area. In 1973 and 1974 Daniel Buren, performs with Jannis Kounellis, Wolf Vostell and other artists in Berlin at the &quot;ADA – Aktionen der Avantgarde&quot;.

Initially presented in Genazzano in 1982, as part of a group project called &quot;La zattera di Babele&quot; (&quot;The Raft of Babel&quot;), &quot;Couleurs superposées (Layered colours)&quot; is an hour-long public performance, during which paper is pasted up and then torn down. For forty minutes, five actors paste striped colored paper on the wall, according to the artist&#x27;s instructions. The white stripes must be exactly aligned. The spectators see colours and shapes appearing and disappearing as successive layers are added. Then for the remaining twenty minutes, the actors, still directed by the artist, tear off the freshly pasted papers to reveal fragments of the previous layers. The spectators watch the evolution of work on a picture that is never finished and whose successive stages are recorded only in their memory. After the performance, the piece is destroyed. The piece was later performed in Tokyo, Bern, Eindhoven, Venice, Villeneuve d&#x27;Ascq, New York (2005), and Paris (2005). In 2009, Buren directed &quot;Couleurs superposées&quot; at the on the occasion of the opening of the Centre Pompidou-Metz.

=== Writing ===
That writing is an important activity for Buren is made particularly clear in his collected texts&quot; Les Écrits&quot;, published in 1991 and then in 2012.

== Exhibitions ==
Buren had his first important solo exhibition at the Galleria Apollinaire in Milan in 1968, where he blocked the only entrance to the gallery, a glass door, with a striped support. He has since presented his environmental installations worldwide. By the 1970s and 1980s he was exhibiting in Europe, America and Japan. Buren wished to take part in Harald Szeemann&#x27;s exhibition &quot;When Attitudes Become Form&quot;, in Bern in 1969, without being invited. Two of the contributing artists offered him space, but he instead set about covering billboards in the city with his stripes. He was arrested and had to leave Switzerland. In 1971, Buren devised a banner, 20 by 10 metres, with white and blue stripes on both sides to be hung at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in a big international group show, conceived to encourage artists to exploit the building&#x27;s space. Other artists, including Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, protested that the banner blocked views across the rotunda, compromising their works. Buren, in turn, said Flavin&#x27;s fluorescent lights colored his banner. The night before the opening, the banner was removed. Buren was later invited to participate in the Documentas 5 through 7 (1972–1982).

In 1986, when François Mitterrand was president of France, Buren attained leading artist status after he created &quot;Les Deux Plateaux&quot; (1985–86), a work in situ for the Cour d&#x27;honneur at the Palais Royal in Paris. That same year, he represented France at the Venice Biennale and won the Golden Lion Award for best pavilion. Buren had major solo exhibitions at the Touko Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, in 1989, at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 2002, at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2005, at Modern Art Oxford in 2006, and at the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden in 2011. In December 2006 Buren won the competition to make &quot;Arcos Rojos/Arku Gorriaka&quot;, a new major project for the iconic Puente de La Salve bridge next to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao while, in February 2007, the Musée Fabre in Montpellier re-opened with a new permanent commission. For the 52nd Venice Biennale, Buren created a new site-specific work for the Giardini of the Italian Pavilion, and was curator of Sophie Calle&#x27;s contribution to the French Pavilion. In 2011, he decided to cancel an exhibition at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing in &quot;solidarity&quot; with detained artist Ai Weiwei. The fifth artist ever to fill the space of the Grand Palais on the occasion of the Monumenta exhibition, Buren conceived &quot;Excentrique(s)&quot; in 2012, a giant cluster of colored, transparent plastic discs, which overlap to form a colourful canopy.

<text>The Sengkang LRT line (SKLRT) is a elevated automated guideway transit line in Sengkang, Singapore. The driverless system consists of 14 stations on two loops, with Sengkang station connecting both loops and connecting the line to the North East MRT line. It is the second Light Rail Transit (LRT) line in Singapore, and the first LRT line operated by SBS Transit.

The SKLRT was planned in tandem with the development of the Sengkang estate. Construction of the LRT stations and viaducts was completed in 2001, and the LTA transferred operations to SBS Transit in September 2002. The east loop began operations on 18 January 2003, followed by the west loop on 29 January 2005, with Kupang station being the last to open on 27 June 2015.

The line operates using the Kyosan Automated People Mover (APM) fixed block signalling system and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&#x27; Crystal Mover APM vehicles. Two-car operations were introduced in December 2015 to accommodate increased ridership. Between 2018 and 2022, the SKLRT underwent renewal works to improve reliability. A new fleet of 25 two-car APMs is expected to enter service in 2025, replacing 25 one-car trains and half of the 16 two-car trains in the existing fleet.

==History==
=== Planning and construction ===
At the groundbreaking ceremony of the Bukit Panjang LRT line on 27 September 1996, deputy prime minister Tony Tan announced the government&#x27;s decision to proceed with the Sengkang LRT (SKLRT) project. The line would be developed alongside the Sengkang estate and integrated with future developments, intended to improve accessibility and convenience for residents. An exhibition for the SKLRT opened on 7 December 1996. The SKLRT was planned to be completed in 2002.

The contract for the design and construction of the Sengkang and Punggol LRT lines was awarded to a joint venture on 4 July 1998 for S$656 million (US$ million). The joint venture comprised Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Corporation. On 20 May 1999, SBS Transit (then Singapore Bus Service) was appointed to operate the SKLRT along with the North East line and the Punggol LRT line.

Construction of the LRT stations and viaducts was completed in 2001. In December that year, subcontractor BRR Holdings withdrew from the LRT project and handed over its responsibilities to SembCorp Engineers and Constructors. According to the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the withdrawal had minimal impact on the construction schedule.

On 1 September 2002, the LTA transferred operations of the SKLRT to SBS Transit, which conducted extensive test runs and trials on the line. This comes in light of frequent delays and breakdowns experienced on the Bukit Panjang LRT. In December 2002, transport minister Yeo Cheow Tong said the opening of the SKLRT would be delayed due to modifications required for the communication and radio systems.

===Stations opening===
The east loop commenced operations on 18 January 2003, offering free rides during its first two days. At the time, 90% of Sengkang residents lived along the east loop, while the west remained largely undeveloped. Although the east loop was scheduled to open at 2pm that day, SBS Transit began operations 30 minutes earlier to accommodate the queue of the 100 waiting commuters. The initial fare on the Sengkang LRT was S$0.64 per trip (US$). The system experienced its first breakdown on 5 September that year because of a computer failure. Free bus services were provided during the 30-minute disruption.

With the exception of the Farmway, Cheng Lim and Kupang stations, the west loop commenced operations on 29 January 2005. To mark the commencement of the west loop, Wee Siew Kim, Adviser to Jalan Kayu Grassroots Organisations, officiated the opening of the bridge linking Thanggam Station to Jalan Kayu via Lorong Samak. The west loop initially operated unidirectional services in the peak flow direction. Morning services from 5:20am to 3:00pm ran anti-clockwise from Thanggam to Renjong, while evening services from 3:00pm to 12:35am operated clockwise from Renjong to Thanggam.

Farmway station opened on 15 November 2007, to serve the Anchorvale Community Club and the Sengkang Sports Complex. On 4 January 2010, the west loop commenced bidirectional services only on weekday peak hours from 6:45 am to 9:00am and from 6.15pm to 8.30pm. Full-day bidirectional services on the west loop began on 1 January 2013 with the opening of Cheng Lim station. Kupang station opened on 27 June 2015 to cater to new residential developments in its vicinity. Daily ridership on the SKLRT at the time had reached 60,000.

A power trip caused a two-hour disruption on the evening of 1 June 2016. On 16 February 2018, a dislodged power collector shoe caused a train to stall near Sengkang station. SBS Transit reported a &quot;loud boom&quot; was heard before the train stalled. Passengers disembarked from the faulty train before a rescue train hauled the train away. Services resumed at 1 pm. On 9 June 2024, the signalling system&#x27;s power supply failed during upgrading works. As a result, no trains could be launched on that morning, with services only resuming at 10:12am.

=== Upgrades ===
On 31 October 2012, the LTA announced plans to increase passenger capacity of the Sengkang and Punggol LRT lines (SPLRT) to cater to increased ridership on the SPLRT. The upgrading works involved retrofitting 16 of the 41 one-car trains for two-car operations while purchasing 16 additional cars. Two-car operations on the SKLRT began on 22 December 2015. The official inauguration of two-car operations on the SKLRT was held on 5 January 2016, with Senior Minister of State for Transport Ng Chee Meng and other Sengkang Members of Parliament in attendance.

On 15 December 2017, the LTA announced plans to renew and upgrade the SPLRT to enhance its operational reliability. The works included replacing the power rail and its assemblies, along with conducting maintenance on the signalling switch machines and cables. Additionally, the crossheads supporting the viaducts were to be reinforced and the viaduct bearings replaced, following the discovery of cracks on the crossheads during routine inspections.

The maintenance works took place on selected Sunday mornings from 14 January to 25 February 2018. On these days, the affected loops ran unidirectional services from 5:30am to 7:00am. Unidirectional services remained in operation on Sunday mornings from 4 March to 29 April due to the extension of maintenance works on the SPLRT. These works involved replacing the power rail and power rail assemblies, as well as carrying out preventive maintenance on the signalling cables. Rectification works on the concrete plinths and elevated slabs were conducted on Sunday evenings between May 27 and October 7. These works involved breaking up the existing concrete plinths, realigning the finger joints, and recementing them into position. Maintenance works during service hours continued in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

In May 2018, the LTA announced plans to refurbish the Sengkang LRT platform. The upgrades included expanding the LRT platform and installing new dual-speed escalators and a new lift to connect the platforms, concourse and mezzanine levels of the station. The works were expected to be completed by 2022. New signs and queue markings were implemented to indicate new stopping locations for each of the four LRT routes plying the station. The refurbished LRT platforms began operations at the end of September 2024.

On 5 February 2021, the LTA announced plans to purchase 17 two-car trains for the SPLRT, which was expected to be delivered from 2024 to 2027. The Sengkang Depot would also be expanded to to ensure additional capacity and maintenance space for the new trains. The depot expansion also included the construction of two new reception tracks to reduce train launching time. In February 2022, the contract for the depot expansion was awarded to Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd for S$157 million (US$ million), and the contract for the new fleet of trains was awarded to Mitsubishi Corporation for S$439 million (US$ million).

==Network and operations==
=== Route and service ===

The Sengkang LRT (SKLRT) is fully elevated automated guideway transit line, with a route length of . It is coloured grey on official maps. On dynamic passenger information displays and static signs on the platforms, yellow indicates the east loop, and red indicates the west loop. The SKLRT has four routes operating on two bi-directional loops that converge at Sengkang station. The line generally runs along road medians, with an average viaduct height of .

On the east loop, the line heads north from Sengkang station before curving eastward and running along the medians of Compassvale Street and Rivervale Drive. After passing Rumbia station, it turns south along Rivervale Drive, then west along Sengkang East Avenue, completing the loop by heading north back to Sengkang station. On the west loop, the line from Sengkang station diverge west toward Cheng Lim station. A spur connects the SKLRT to the Punggol LRT line across the Tampines Expressway. The SKLRT runs along Anchorvale Street and Fernvale Street. Between the Farmway and Kupang stations, the line crosses Sungei Punggol. After Kupang station, the line turns south along Fernvale Road, and turns east along Sengkang West Avenue. It crosses Sungei Punggol again between Layar and Tongkang stations, with reception tracks connecting the line to Sengkang Depot. Following Renjong station, the line completes the loop by heading north back to Sengkang station.

The line operates between 5:18am (5:38am on Sundays and public holidays) and 12:37am daily. The SKLRT is operated by SBS Transit. Since 2018, the SKLRT has been part of the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF). Previously, the operator (the owner of the rail assets) had to bear the cost of maintaining and upgrading trains and signalling. Under the NRFF, the LTA and SBS Transit will share the profits and financial risks in operating the line and the LTA will take control of its operating assets on 1 April 2033. SBS Transit will operate the line under a 15-year licence which will expire on 31 March 2033.

===Stations===
The east loop has five stations, while the west loop has eight stations. The average distance between stations are , with each station positioned to serve residents within a radius.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Rolling stock ===
The Sengkang and Punggol LRT lines (SPLRT) utilise the Crystal Mover Automated People Mover (APM) rolling stock manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The rubber-tired trains are fully automatic and can accommodate up to 105 passengers per vehicle. The SPLRT has an initial fleet of 41 APMs, with 16 more APMs delivered under contract C810A. The APMs are configured for single car or two-car operations, with a maximum capacity of 36 trainsets on the network. In February 2022, the LTA ordered another fleet of 17 two-car APMs from Mitsubishi for S$439 million. This was followed by another order for eight more two-car trains in May 2023, costing S$87 million. The new trains are set to replace the 25 one-car trains and half of the 16 two-car trains, bringing the overall SPLRT fleet to 33 two-car APMs. The first two trainsets were delivered to Singapore on 23 November 2024 and are expected to commence operations in 2025.

The APMs have a top speed of , with a maximum operational speed of . They are powered by 750V DC third rail located on one side of the guideway. Each vehicle is long and wide. The exterior has a crystal-like design with a polyhedral nose reflective of its namesake. Mitsubishi describes the curved sides of the APM as a design choice to &quot;soften&quot; the sharpness of its polyhedral shape. The exterior is painted pearl white and indigo blue.

As driverless vehicles, the APMs do not include a driver cabin. Instead, detrainment doors at both ends of the cabin allow emergency evacuation of passengers onto the track. The emergency stop button and emergency notice system are located at the right-side corner of the vehicle&#x27;s front, while line maps and service information are displayed on the left. The interior features white side panels and ceiling, a grey floor, grayish-blue seats, and handrails and grip bars accented in a wine color. The cabins are air-conditioned.

The SPLRT trains are maintained and stabled on the second floor of Sengkang Depot. Located between the Layar and Tongkang LRT stations, the depot also houses the trains of the North East line. Its facilitates include a two-story main building with an operation control center room, automatic vehicle washing facility, maintenance garage, departure inspection track, stabling yard, power receiving and transforming facilities, and a test track. The site is being expanded to , which will include two more reception tracks and three new traction power substations to expand the depot&#x27;s stabling and maintenance capacity.

=== Train control and power system ===
The Sengkang LRT line is fully automatic, and is equipped with Kyosan APM fixed block signalling system. The line&#x27;s automatic train control (ATC) is composed of automatic train protection (ATP) which ensure safe operations, automatic train operation (ATO) which controls the automatic operations, and automatic train supervision (ATS) for overall command, monitoring and recording of the system. To reduce equipment mass on the train, the onboard ATP and ATO systems are integrated into one unit, although for safety reasons, the function and control logic of the AVP and AVO systems remain independent. These subsystems are connected via LAN and managed by a computer-based interlocking (CBI) system that oversees traffic safety of the APM.

The power system of the SKLRT includes a 22kV AC power intake and distribution network, a 750V DC traction power system, and a 400V AC system for station services. Power is supplied via two 22kV AC feeders from the North East line to improve reliability and take advantage of the 66kV tariff. The AC supply is distributed through a closed ring network to prevent power disruptions during single outages. At each station, the AC supply is stepped down to 400V AC using service transformers for mechanical and electrical needs. Traction power substations (TPSS) further step down the 22kV AC to power rectifiers that convert it to 750V DC for train operations. Each TPSS is equipped with an inverter system to return excess energy from regenerative braking back to the 22kV distribution network. In 2004, the SKLRT has three TPSS, with one on standby to maintain operations during outages. Currently, five traction power substations (TPSS) are operational on the SKLRT. This number will increase to eight with the planned expansion of Sengkang Depot.

===Station facilities===

All Sengkang LRT stations are equipped with lifts connecting passengers from the ground level to the station concourse, and from the concourse to the platform level. Each station also has at least one wider faregate for wheelchair users, and tactile flooring to guide the visually-impaired from the ground floor to the platforms. The stations are also equipped with fire extinguishers and fire phones. Emergency stop buttons on both sides of the station platform, when activated, cuts off traction power supply and halts incoming trains.

Fixed platform barriers installed by Chee Yam Contractor are intended to prevent commuters falling to the tracks. However, the barriers do not have doors and instead have fixed openings for boarding trains. The lack of doors have been criticised by a commuter as a &quot;half-baked solution&quot; and felt the barriers would instead restrict rescue efforts. Nevertheless, the limited space of the LRT platforms could not accommodate the power, communications and signal control rooms required for platform screen doors.

To enhance safety, SBS Transit has implemented the VAnGuard track intrusion detection system on the SPLRT. Using video analytics and artificial intelligence, the system monitors footage of tracks and platforms to identify individuals or objects on the tracks. When an intrusion is detected, operations control centre staff can press the emergency stop button to halt services along on a specific loop. The system also triggers an alarm when intruders or foreign objects are detected. In addition to track intrusions, the system can spot unattended items on station platforms, allowing staff to provide assistance or undertake security precautions.

<doc id="1148696" wikidata="Q85776019" url="?curid=1148696" title="Law enforcement in France">
<text>Law enforcement in France is centralized at the national level. Recently, legislation has allowed local governments to hire their own police officers which are called the &quot;police municipale&quot;.

There are two national police forces called &quot;&quot;Police nationale&quot; and &quot;&quot;Gendarmerie nationale&quot;. The Prefecture of Police of Paris provides policing services directly to Paris as a subdivision of France&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior. Within these national forces, only certain designated police officers have the power to conduct criminal investigations which are supervised by investigative magistrates.

==History==
Law enforcement has a long history dating back to AD 570 when night watch systems were commonplace.

==Organizations==

===National agencies===

France has two national police forces:

* The National Police (&quot;Police nationale&quot;), formerly called the &quot;&quot;Sûreté&quot;, is considered a civilian police force. Its origins date back to 1812 and was created by Eugène François Vidocq. In 1966, its name was officially changed to &quot;Police Nationale&quot;&quot;. It has primary responsibility for major cities and large urban areas. The &quot;Police Nationale&quot; are under the control of the Ministry of the Interior; its strength is roughly 149,000;The Paris Police Prefecture, directly controlled by the French Minister of the Interior (France), who are assisted by the &quot;Direction de la Prévention, de la Sécurité et de la Protection&quot; (DPSP) (Prevention, Security and Protection Directorate) is composed of Agents with municipal police powers titled inspecteurs de sécurité (Security Inspectors). This is one of the few exceptions to the General Directorate&#x27;s exclusive control.
* The National Gendarmerie (&quot;Gendarmerie nationale&quot;) is part of the French armed forces. It has the primary responsibility for policing smaller towns and rural areas as well as the armed forces and military installations, airport security and shipping ports. Being a military force, the gendarmerie has a highly centralized organization structure. It is under the control of both the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior (as far as its civil duties are concerned). The Gendarmerie&#x27;s origin dates back to 1306 when King Philippe le Bel (Philip the Fair) formed the first mounted military police force called the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot;. Between 1697 and 1699, King Louis XIV asserted his authority over police in France and the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; became the formal law enforcement arm of the country. In February 1791, it was renamed &quot;gendarmerie nationale&quot; by the revolutionary government of France. It includes a coast guard agency, the Maritime Gendarmerie (&quot;Gendarmerie maritime&quot;). Today, there are about 102,000 &quot;gendarmes&quot; in France.
Their main tasks include the fight against drug trafficking, terrorism, gang activities, damages to property and persons, riots, illegal immigration, money laundering and road traffic offenses, maintaining public safety, securing important events, solving criminal cases, helping and rescuing victims of human-made and natural disasters and for the Gendarmerie only, the surveillance of some important infrastructures, like airports, nuclear power plants and military sites.

=== Other agencies ===

====National level====

*The General Directorate for Internal Security (&quot;Direction générale de la Sécurité Intérieure&quot; or &quot;DGSI&quot;) came into existence in 2008, initially as the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence (&quot;Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur&quot; (&quot;DCRI&quot;)). The DCRI combined two services of the National Police HQ. The Central Directorate for General Intelligence (&quot;Direction Centrale des Renseignements généraux&quot; (&quot;RG&quot;)) was tasked with intelligence data gathering, classification and analysis. The Directorate for Surveillance of the Territory (&quot;Direction de la surveillance du territoire&quot; (&quot;DST&quot;)) was a plainclothes operational service tasked with counterespionage, counterterrorism and economic security. In 2014 the DCRI was taken out of the structure of the National Police and directly subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior as a separate agency and the name of the DCRI was changed to General Directorate of Internal Intelligence. The service is informally known as the RG by the abbreviation of the former Central Directorate of General Intelligence.
*The Directorate-general of Customs and Indirect Taxes (&quot;Direction générale des Douanes et Droits indirects&quot; or &quot;DGDDI&quot;), a nowadays civilian customs service more commonly known as the &quot;&quot;Douanes&quot;, under the minister of budget, public accounting and civil servants; its strength is roughly 17,000 customs officers. It operates mainly on a different framework of the other agencies. Its main tasks regarding law enforcement are the fight against drug, counterfeit goods and protected species trafficking, evasion of customs duties, importation of non-compliant goods, alcohol and tobacco smuggling, money laundering and illegal immigration and the surveillance of French borders and territorial waters. It includes a coast guard agency, the Directorate-national of the Customs coast guard (&quot;Direction nationale des Garde-côtes des Douanes&quot; or &quot;DNGCD&quot;);
*The judicial tax officers (&quot;officiers fiscaux judiciaires&quot;, often called by their acronym &quot;OFJ&quot;) of the Directorate-general of Public Finances (&quot;Direction générale des Finances publiques&quot; or &quot;DGFiP&quot;) are armed investigators of the tax administration in charge of repressing serious and potentially dangerous tax crime situations, sometimes linked with organized crime. They are closely working with police and customs services. There are around 50 judicial tax officers;
*The National Forests Office (&quot;Office national des Forêts&quot; or &quot;ONF&quot;) is the continuation of the Water and Forests military corp founded in 1291 and today under both the Ministry of environment and the Ministry of Agriculture. Its main tasks regarding law enforcement are the fight against forest degradation, poaching and pollution, the surveillance of state-owned forests and the control of hunting licenses. Its strength is roughly 8,000 forest rangers;
*The French Office for Biodiversity (&quot;Office français de la Biodiversité&quot; or &quot;OFB&quot;) is mainly responsible for the monitoring of French wildlife. Its main tasks regarding law enforcement include the fight against environment degradation, poaching, pollution and protected species trafficking, the control of hunting and fishing licenses and the surveillance of French national parks and marine parks. Its strength is roughly 3,000 wildlife officers, fishery officers, national park rangers and marine park rangers;
*The Prison Administration (&quot;Administration pénitentiaire&quot;) is the public service of the Ministry of Justice responsible for the execution of court decisions in criminal matters and to promote the social reintegration of persons entrusted to it by the judicial authority. Its action is based on 187 penitentiary establishments and 104 penitentiary integration and probation services (SPIP) distributed within ten interregional directorates of penitentiary services (DISP) in mainland France and overseas, placed under the authority of the Department of Prison Administration (DAP) whose current director is Laurent Ridel. Its strength is roughly 41,000 prison officers. French prison officers are not armed, except when transferring prisoners or when restoring order during prison riots.
*The Directorate general for Maritime affairs, Fisheries and Aquaculture (&quot;Direction générale des Affaires maritimes, de la Pêche et de l&#x27;Aquaculture&quot; or &quot;DGAMPA&quot;) commonly known as the &quot;Affaires maritimes&quot;&quot; is the coast guard agency of the State Secretariat for the Sea. Its main tasks regarding law enforcement are the surveillance of marine traffic and fisheries and the fight against marine pollution and poaching at sea. Today there are about 3,000 coast guards of the Maritime Affairs;
*The Railway Security Agency (&quot;Sûreté ferroviaire&quot; or &quot;SuGe&quot;) of the SNCF, the Network Protection and Safety Group (&quot;Groupe de Protection et de Sécurité des Réseaux&quot; or &quot;GPSR&quot;) of the RATP Group and the Support and Protection Group (&quot;Groupe d&#x27;Assistance et de Protection&quot; or &quot;GAP&quot;) of the RTM Group are responsible for maintaining security in stations, on trains and in subway stations of their respective public transport group. Their powers are far more limited than those of the Police, Gendarmerie and Customs officers. The agents of the &quot;GAP&quot; are not armed contrary to those of the &quot;SuGe&quot; and the &quot;GPSR&quot;. Their combined strength is roughly 4,000 railway security officers. The SNCF, the RATP and the RTM are also employing non-armed controllers in charge of checking the validity of the tickets of the passengers;
*The Metropolitan Support and Assistance Ships of the Navy (&quot;Marine nationale&quot;) carry out missions of law enforcement in the French territorial waters, such as the fight against maritime pollution and illegal immigration, acting as a military coast guard agency;
*The military of the Opération Sentinelle are present in sensitive public areas, such as railway stations and tourist zones, to protect them from terrorist threats, also assisting conventional law enforcement agencies. They are mainly military of the Army (&quot;Armée de Terre&quot;).
Many other administrations and public bodies carry out investigations and repressions of offenses, but due to the nature of their tasks, they are not regarded as law enforcement agencies.

====Local level====

The municipal policemen are &quot;Agent de police judiciaire adjoint&quot; (see below). There are also local police in the rural zones, as for the rural policemen the &quot;police rurale&quot; as such does not exist. Note the heterogeneity of local police both in means and in equipment.
* The municipal police (&quot;Polices municipales&quot;) are the local police of towns and cities in France, dating back to the Middle Ages. The municipal police officers are under the direct authority of the mayor. They may be armed at the request of the mayor and with the approval of the prefect, but it is not always the case. Their main tasks are the maintenance of safety in town, the fight against environment degradation and road traffic offenses and the reinforcement of the National Police and Gendarmerie forces when it is needed. There are roughly 24,000 municipal police officers in 4,555 communities;
* The rural guards (&quot;gardes champêtres&quot;) are the equivalent of municipal police officers but for smaller towns and villages. They are under the direct authority of the mayor. Like municipal police officers they may be armed at the request of the mayor and with the approval of the prefect, though it is not always the case. They have the same tasks as their urban counterparts. Today, there are roughly 1,000 rural guards in France;
* The public roads surveillance officers (&quot;agents de surveillance de la voie publique&quot;, often called by their acronym &quot;ASVP&quot;) are responsible for the fight against road traffic offenses, environment degradation and minor disturbances in towns and cities, under the direct authority of the mayor. They cannot be armed, even with non-lethal weapons, contrary to municipal police officers and rural guards. Today, there are roughly 8,000 surveillance of public road officers;
* The Coastal Protection Agency (&quot;Conservatoire du Littoral&quot;) is a public organisation in charge of the protection of outstanding littoral areas and thus, the fight against environment degradation and poaching on coastal areas. Its officers are employed and paid by local communities but working with the uniform of their agency. The strength of the Coastal protection agency is roughly 1,000 coastline officers;
* The French Nature Reserves (&quot;Réserves naturelles de France&quot; or &quot;RNF&quot;) is a public organisation in charge of the protection of areas classified nature reserves and thus, the fight against environment degradation. Its officiers are employed and paid by local communities but working with the uniform of their agency. They can only bear non-lethal weapons, contrary to their counterparts of the Coastal Protection Agency. There are less than 1,000 nature reserves officers today in France.
*The Louveterie (literally : &quot;Wolf-catching agency&quot;) is one of the oldest law enforcement forces, dating back to 813 when it was founded by Charlemagne. Its officers are independent of each other. Even though their main tasks are the fight against pest and large predators, when it is needed, and the surveillance of driven hunts, they also have law enforcement tasks, such as the fight against poaching and the control of hunting licenses. There are today nearly 2,000 wolfcatchers across the French territory;
*The private guards (&quot;gardes particuliers&quot;), despite their denomination, are sworn officers, which can be employed by the local Certified Association for Fishing and Protection of Aquatic Environments (&quot;Association agréée de pêche et de protection des milieux aquatiques&quot; or &quot;AAPPMA&quot;), the local Departmental Federation of Hunters (&quot;Fédération départementale des Chasseurs&quot; or &quot;FDC&quot;) or by the municipalities, in natural areas that are under their direct management. They can be employed by strictly private organisations and land owners to work on private properties, but are not regarded as being part of the law enforcement forces in such a case. They are armed officers, allowed to conduct their activities by the prefect and are placed under the authority of the public prosecutor. Their main tasks regarding law enforcement are the fight against poaching and environment degradation and the control of hunting licenses, although their powers are far more limited than those of the rural guards and of the officers of the French Office for Biodiversity, the National Forests Office, the municipal polices and the Coastal Protection Agency. Some of them are affiliated with the National Federation of Private Guards, but this is not mandatory. There are more than 50,000 private guards in France;
*The military personnel of the Armed Forces in Guiana (&quot;Forces armées en Guyane&quot;), mainly the military of the Army (&quot;Armée de Terre&quot;), are participating in law enforcement tasks, such as the protection of the Guiana Space Centre and the fight against illegal gold mining. There are roughly 2,000 military in these forces;
* The Territorial Guard of Wallis and Futuna (&quot;Garde territoriale de Wallis-et-Futuna&quot;) is the local equivalent of a non-armed municipal police force, under the command of the prefect. Its strength is roughly 20 territorial guards.

===Police and &quot;gendarmerie&quot;===
The leadership of both agencies is centralized and they both have conventional deviance control responsibilities respectively except in different geographical locations in France. The &quot;Police Nationale&quot; is responsible for Paris and other urban areas whereas the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; is responsible for small towns and rural areas with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants. The existence of two national police forces with similar goals and attributions, but somewhat different zones of activity, has at times created friction or competition between the two. Their merging has sometimes been suggested.

With the development of suburban dwellings, this had increasingly proved inadequate. Furthermore, the shifting of a town from a police to a &quot;gendarmerie&quot; zone was often controversial, because, typically, a &quot;gendarmerie&quot; unit serves a wide area.

A redistribution of authority was thus decided and implemented between 2003 and 2005. Large conurbations are now handled entirely by the police. Rural and suburban areas, and some smaller cities with populations ranging from 5,000 to 16,000, are handled by the &quot;gendarmerie&quot;.

In addition, the police and the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; have specific zones of authority:
* the police handle questions about the admittance, monitoring and continuing stay of foreigners (border police);
* the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; handle all matters regarding the military, the police at sea, the security of airports, and the security of certain public buildings (Republican Guard).

=== French police jurisdictions ===

In French, the term &quot;police&quot; not only refers to the forces, but also to the general concept of &quot;maintenance of law and order&quot; (policing).

There are two types of police in this general sense:
* administrative police (&quot;police administrative&quot;), upholding public order, safety checks and traffic controls, assistance to people in imminent danger, protection duties, etc.
* judicial police (&quot;police judiciaire&quot;), handling penal law enforcement and investigation of crimes and felonies under the authority of a Magistrate (&quot;Procureur de la République&quot;) in every case.

Also, the mayor (&quot;le maire&quot;) has administrative police power in a &quot;commune&quot; (municipality), which means that the mayor can order the police to enforce municipal bylaws.

A judge has police power in his courtroom (i.e. the judge can order people who disrupt the trial to be expelled from the proceedings).

Until 1984, the National Police were involved in prehospital rescue operations and casualty transport (called &quot;police-secours&quot;). Prehospital aid is now performed by fire services; however, mountain rescue is shared between the gendarmerie&#x27;s PGHM (&quot;pelotons de gendarmerie de haute montagne&quot;, High Mountain Platoons of the Gendarmerie) and the National Police&#x27;s CRS (&quot;compagnies républicaines de sécurité&quot;; Republican [national] security companies).

Many other countries have followed the French model and have established separate police agencies with the same role but different jurisdictions.

A local precinct of the &quot;police nationale&quot; (called &quot;commissariat&quot;) or the &quot;gendarmerie nationale&quot; (called &quot;brigade&quot;) may not be capable of conducting complex investigations. For this reason, both the police and the gendarmerie maintain regional services dedicated to criminal investigations (&quot;police judiciaire&quot;); these are known as &quot;regional services of judiciary police&quot; (&quot;Services régionaux de la Police judiciaire&quot;) in the police, &quot;research sections&quot; (&quot;Sections de recherche de la Gendarmerie nationale&quot;) in the gendarmerie. In addition, both the police and the gendarmerie maintain laboratories dedicated to forensics. The forensics service of the police is called &quot;Police technique et scientifique&quot; (Technical and Scientific Police). It is the equivalent of the American CSI Units.

Most criminal enquiries are conducted by the police. Justice may choose either service; sometimes, if the judiciary is disappointed by the results or the methods of one service, it may give the enquiry to the other service.

The National Police also features some central offices with national jurisdiction, charged with specific missions, such as the national anti-terrorist division.

Both the police and the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; have police tactical units. The &quot;gendarmerie&quot; has the foremost and best-known, the GIGN; the police have the RAID and the BRI groups. The gendarmerie also has armoured and paratroop squadrons.

Both the police and the gendarmerie have crowd and riot control forces: the CRS (Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité) for the police, the &quot;gendarmerie mobile&quot; for the gendarmerie. They intervene throughout the country.

One reason for giving commission to a military force to handle matters of civilian police is that the military is not allowed to go on strike, contrary to civilian public servants such as the police personnel, which enables the government to always have an instrument of law enforcement at hand.

Another advantage of the gendarmerie is that, being career soldiers, they have the authority to use armed force in a much less restricted way than the police (in popular culture so-called &quot;licence to kill&quot;).

The gendarmes have free housing facilities inside their respective gendarmerie brigades (precincts) or live in barracks (&quot;casernes&quot;), which is not the case for the police.

== Functions ==

===Administrative police===
The Administrative police () ensure the maintenance of public order and prevent crime, and are not involved the search for, or arrest of perpetrators of a particular offense.

It comprises a variety of actions undertaken under the direction and supervision of the executive branch, notably the prefect, police and gendarmerie forces conduct a variety of actions ensuring public order. They include:
* directing road traffic
* channelling street demonstrations
* positioning riot control forces (CRS or mobile &quot;gendarmerie&quot;)

===Judicial police===
The Judicial police () is responsible for investigating, prosecuting, and punishing perpetrators of criminal offenses. Responsibilities include:
* pursuing and arresting suspects
* interrogating suspects in some phases of judicial enquiries
* gathering evidence
* serving search warrants

These actions must follow the rules given in the French code of criminal procedure, articles 12 to 29.

In order to better fulfill these missions, the &quot;Direction Centrale de la Police Judiciaire&quot; of the French National Police regroups all the units specialized in criminal enquiries. The &quot;gendarmerie&quot; counterpart are the &quot;sections de recherche&quot; (research sections).

==Rights and limitations==
The powers of French police and &quot;gendarmerie&quot; forces are constrained by statute law. The rules of procedure depend on the stage of enquiry:

* Crimes committed &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;, in which a suspect was found committing the crime, or pursued by witnesses, or found in possession of objects from the crime or other probable cause.
* Preliminary enquiries: it is unclear whether a crime, or which crime, has been committed, but there exist good reasons to believe this might be the case.
* Judicial information: an investigative magistrate (a judge, external to the police) supervises an inquiry on a case where it is certain, or at least very probable, that a crime has been committed.

In particular, except for crimes &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;, law enforcement forces may not conduct searches or arrests without a specific commission from the investigative magistrate. Depending on legal status of cases, not all law enforcement officers are able to act; some powers are restricted to those with special legal qualifications (see next section).

==Officers and agents of judicial police==


The procedures that police and &quot;gendarmerie&quot; officers follow when conducting criminal inquiries are set by the French code of criminal procedure () and applicable jurisprudence. Criminal inquiries are conducted under the supervision of the judiciary (depending on the phase, under the supervision of the public prosecutor or of an investigative judge).

There are three judiciary qualifications: &quot;officer of judicial police&quot; ( or OPJ), &quot;agent of judicial police&quot; ( or APJ) and &quot;agent of judicial police assistant&quot; (APJ ). The qualifications of OPJ and APJ can only be exercised if they are affected to a position where these are needed, and, for the OPJs by nominal decision of the general prosecutor of their area. These prerogatives are temporarily suspended when they engage, in an organized force, in an operation of public order (i.e. riot control).

* Mayors and deputy mayors are OPJs. This disposition is rarely used.
* In the National Police, these are qualified as OPJs:
** the commissioners and above ranks;
** the titular members of the nominally listed in a joint decision by the ministers of justice and of the interior;
** members of the who have completed three years of service, and are nominally listed in a joint decision by the ministers of justice and of the interior.
* In the National &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;, these are qualified as OPJs:
** commissioned officers
** non-commissioned officers having completed three years of service, nominally designated by a joint decision by the ministers of justice and of defense.

These ministerial nomination decisions may only be taken after the approval of a specific commission. The current rules also warrant the completion of an examination pertaining to legal matters.

Most other members of the National Police and &quot;gendarmerie&quot; are APJs. The remaining members of the National Police, as well as members of municipal police forces, are APJ assistants.

Only OPJs may serve search (this includes anybody search more invasive than external palpation) and put somebody in custody (&quot;garde à vue&quot;) for 24 hours; APJs may only assist them in these tasks. Suspects apprehended by an APJ must be brought before an OPJ which will in turn have to inform the public prosecutor. According to the law, any citizen can apprehend the author of a crime or of an offense that can be punished by a prison sentence (citizen&#x27;s arrest) and lead him or her to an OPJ. However, this is problematic in case of a &quot;simple&quot; citizen due to the estimation of what can be punished by a prison sentence or not, and due to possible abuse (abuses are a restriction of individual freedom and can be sued for illegal confinement).

The quality of officer of judiciary police may be withdrawn by the judiciary if the officer has behaved in an inappropriate fashion. The general prosecutor grades OPJs and these grades are taken into account for possible promotions.

<text>Lamba (, ), is a small village in the bottom of the inlet of Lambavík on the east coast of Eysturoy, Faroe Islands.

There are similarly named places, Lamba in Shetland and Lambay in Ireland.

==Settlement==
The houses in Lamba are spread down through the valley following the road on its way from the bottom of the valley down to the small harbour.

There is a huge rock in the harbour. Nobody wants to remove it because it is said to be inhabited by ‘huldufólk’, a race of elfs or faries that people used to believe in. They are said to be fierce if disturbed.

Heri Joensen of Viking metal band Týr is from Lamba.

<text>HMS &quot;Defiance&quot; was a 74-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built by Randall and Co., at Rotherhithe on the River Thames, and launched on 10 December 1783.

==History==
She was commissioned by Lt M.T. Hewitt for Captain George Keppel. He sailed her with the Channel Fleet during September and October 1796 at which time it was reported that,
Her qualifications are described as having been of a very superior order. She stowed her provisions well, and when sailing with the Channel fleet in September and October, 1796, beat all the line of battle ships, and kept pace with the frigates. &quot; Upon a wind,&quot; Rays
the Master&#x27;s report, &quot; spared them&quot; (the line of battle ships) &quot; main-sail and top-gallant sails, and sailing two or three points free or before the wind, beat them still more.&quot; At this time the Defiance&#x27;s draught of water forward was 20 feet 5 inches; aft, 22 feet 5 inches; height of the midship port, 5 feet 8 inches. Her masts were stayed thus: &quot;foremast nearly upright, main and mizenmasts rake aft.&quot;

Her crew mutinied three times, firstly in October 1795, when she was under the command of Captain Sir George Home. He initially had to release the ringleaders when the ratings attempted to storm the officer&#x27;s quarters, but later these and additional mutineers were put in irons when,
...in the afternoon a strong party of the 7th, or South Fencible regiment, and several officers, arrived on board. On the 20th, at 10 a.m., a general muster of the ship&#x27;s company was made, and the eight men, previously in irons, together with three more, were placed in confinement, and others were subsequently added. A few days afterwards the South Fencibles were relieved by a detachment of the 134th Regt., in number 132, under Lieut.-Colonel Baillie, and with these the Defiance sailed from Leith and returned to the Nore.
The stationing of the Army troops was required because the ship sailed without its contingent of 60 Marines, which later embarked at Sheerness.

On 23 March 1796 Captain Theophilus Jones took command.

The crew of the &quot;Defiance&quot; mutinied for a second time in 1797 during the Spithead mutiny. Captain William Bligh of the was ordered to embark 200 troops and take them alongside in order for the troops to board &quot;Defiance&quot; and regain control, however the threat of the soldiers was sufficient to bring about an end to the mutiny. Her next Captain was Thomas Revell Shivers, who took command on 27 February 1797 at Torbay

In July 1798, while rebellion raged in Ireland, a court martial aboard &quot;HMS Defiance&quot; took evidence of United Irish oaths being administered as a prelude to a further mutiny. Eleven of the crew were hanged and ten sentenced to transportation.

In the summer of 1800, &quot;Defiance&quot; was attached to the squadron under Sir Alan Gardner, stationed off the Black Rocks. On 24 December 1800, Capt. Richard Retallick superseded Capt. Shivers, &quot;Defiance&quot; being selected for the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves.

She fought at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Thomas Graves, with Captain Retallick commanding. The station in the line occupied in the battle was abreast of the Crown battery, which mounted thirty-six heavy guns, and was provided with a furnace for heating shot. Owing to the mishaps that kept , Russell, and Agamemnon from taking up their assigned stations, the Defiance became exposed to a severe cross fire, from which she suffered very severe damage. In furtherance of the designs of Lord Nelson, when Sir Hyde
Parker made the signal to discontinue the action, which Nelson would not see, Rear-Admiral Graves in the Defiance repeated the signal at the lee maintopsail yardarm, from whence it could not be seen on board the Elephant. The Defiance continued firing until 3h. 15m. p.m., when the action ceased; and her spring being cut and sail made, she dropped out of the station she had occupied. Shortly afterwards, the Defiance grounded, and was with difficulty hove off, after starting thirty butts of water. During the action the ship was frequently set on fire by the hot 42-pound shot fired from the batteries, and her damages were consequently serious. Her loss in killed and wounded was as follows Lieutenant George Gray*, Matthew Cobb, pilot, 17 seamen, 3 marines, and 2 soldiers, killed; and the boatswain Lewis Patterson, James Galloway, Midshipman, Harry Niblett, Captain&#x27;s Clerk, – Stephenson, pilot, 35 seamen, 5 marines, and 7 soldiers, wounded: total, 24 killed, and 51 wounded.

===Finnisterre and Trafalgar===
She also participated in the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, and the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, whilst under the command of Captain Philip Charles Durham, who claimed that &quot;she was the fastest 74 gun ship in the British fleet&quot;.

At Trafalgar the &quot;Defiance&quot; captured the Spanish &quot;San Juan Nepomuceno&quot;, and the French &quot;Aigle&quot; (although the following day the French crew managed to recapture the &quot;Aigle&quot; from the British prize crew shortly before she was wrecked during the storm of 23 October).

Prior to the boarding of the &quot;Aigle&quot; by a full boarding party from the &quot;Defiance&quot;, James &quot;Jack&quot; Spratt dived into the sea from &quot;Defiance&quot;, swimming with a cutlass between his teeth to the &quot;Aigle&quot; he climbed in through a stern window and boarded her single handed. He found his way to the French poop deck and threw himself on the French crew, one man against several hundred. In the melee he killed two French seamen, and was grappling with a third when he fell from the poop deck to the main deck, killing his opponent but injuring himself badly. He was saved by the timely arrival of a full boarding party from &quot;Defiance&quot;.

During the battle of Trafalgar &quot;Defiance&quot; and sustained casualties of 57 killed, and 153 wounded.

===Final service and fate===
In 1809, she took part in the Battle of Les Sables-d&#x27;Olonne.

&quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; reported in February 1809 that the man-of-war &quot;Defiance&quot; had sent the French cutter &quot;Prudente&quot; into Plymouth. &quot;Prudente&quot; had been on her way from .

==Fate==
After serving as a prison ship at Chatham from 1813, she was broken up in 1817.

<text>Hestur () is an island in the central Faroe Islands, to the west of Streymoy and the south of Koltur. &quot;Hestur&quot; means &quot;horse&quot; in Faroese.

On the west coast is a guillemot colony. In the north there is moorland with four small lakes, of which Fagradalsvatn is the largest. At Hælur, Hestur&#x27;s southernmost tip, there is a lighthouse. The island has one settlement, a village also named Hestur on the east coast. The village enjoys the view over to Gamlarætt and Velbastaður on Streymoy. There is a ferry link to the port at Gamlarætt.

==History==
The island has been settled since Viking times; the old settlement was at Hælur, the southern tip of the island. Due to it being the sunward side of the island, cereal ripened better there than anywhere else on the island. But due to extreme difficulties in landing boats there, the village was abandoned and the current village of Hestur was established.

In 1919 a fishing accident resulted in the deaths of one-third of Hestur&#x27;s men. In an attempt to fight the depopulation of the village, a swimming pool was built on the island in 1974. On the southern part of the island by the lake Fagradalsvatn, one can camp. Hestur&#x27;s postal code is FO 280. Since 1 January 2005 the island has been part of the municipality of Tórshavn.

==Important Bird Area==
The coastline of the island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially Atlantic puffins (25,000 pairs), European storm petrels (5000 pairs) and black guillemots (50 pairs).

== Mountains ==
The island has the following four mountains

<text>Giovanni Lindo Ferretti (born 9 September 1953) is an Italian singer-songwriter, composer, and author. He is considered to be one of the founders of Italian punk rock music.

==Biography==
Ferretti was born in Cerreto Alpi (&quot;frazione&quot; of Collagna), in the province of Reggio Emilia, in the western part of the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. After completing his studies and working as a psychiatric nurse for five years, Lindo Ferretti traveled around Europe.

===CCCP===

In East Berlin, he met , with whom, in 1982, he founded the band CCCP Fedeli alla linea (&quot;CCCP Loyal to the Line&quot;). CCCP soon became a benchmark of the so-called &quot;alternative music&quot; in Italy. The band dissolved in 1990.

===CSI===

In 1992, again with Massimo Zamboni and with an original core member of the Italian band Litfiba, Gianni Maroccolo, he founded a new band called Consorzio Suonatori Indipendenti (Consortium of Independent Players), also known as CSI. This band continued until 2000, when Zamboni departed. The bands’ names followed the naming of the political entities of the Soviet Union and its dissolution in the late 20th century. &quot;CCCP&quot; is the Cyrillic lettering for SSSR (i.e. USSR), and &quot;CSI&quot; mimics the Italian acronym for the Commonwealth of Independent States.

===PGR===

From 2002, he led the band PGR, an abbreviation of &quot;Per Grazia Ricevuta&quot; (&quot;For a Received Grace&quot;). This is a stock phrase usually attached to mementos acknowledging miraculous divine gifts. The new band name, in fact, marked his own rediscovery of his Catholic roots.

PGR&#x27;s lineup changed with the release of the album &quot;D’anime e d’animali&quot; (2004), and in the fashion of previous incarnations the name was altered. In this case, however, the band&#x27;s acronym was only slightly changed into PG3R (&quot;Però Gianni Giorgio Giovanni Resistono&quot;, meaning &quot;Yet Gianni Giorgio and Giovanni Resist&quot;). PGR toured again in 2006, with the tour entitled &#x27;Ripasso / Ribassi – Saldi, fino ad esaurimento scorte’ (Revision / Discounts – Sales while Stock Lasts). With the release of the album &quot;Ultime notizie di cronaca&quot; in 2009, the band announced its dissolution.

===Solo work and collaborations with other artists===
In 2000, Ferretti published the book &quot;In Mongolia in retromarcia&quot; (&quot;In Mongolia, in reverse&quot;), co-authored with Massimo Zamboni, about their journey there. This trip also influenced CSI&#x27;s third album, &quot;Tabula Rasa Elettrificata&quot;. Also in 2000 he released a solo album, &quot;Co.Dex&quot;.

In 2003, together with director Giorgio Barberio Corsetti, Lindo Ferretti wrote the texts and lyrics for the theatrical work &quot;Iniziali: BCGLF&quot;. The music was composed by fellow PGR member Gianni Maroccolo. A CD of the same name was released in 2004. Also in 2004 he released the album &quot;Litania&quot; (&quot;Litany&quot;), co-authored with Ambrogio Sparagna, which contains both folk prayers and pieces from the repertoire of CCCP and CSI.

He toured Italy again in 2005 with the theatrical shows &quot;Falce e Martello. Falciati e martellati. Requiem per una civiltà&quot; (&quot;Hammer and Sickle. Hammered and Sickled. Requiem for a Civilisation&quot;), with Ambrogio Sparagna, and &quot;Pascolare parole, allevare pensieri&quot; (&quot;Pasturing words, Breeding thoughts&quot;), with LEF (born Lorenzo Esposito Fornasari), Raffaele Pinelli and Ezio Bonicelli.

===Politics and recent activities===
Radical left political thought marked much of Ferretti&#x27;s musical and artistic output, and he had been involved with the extra-parliamentary radical group Lotta Continua. He subsequently revised his political thinking, however, and in the 2006 elections he voted for the right-center coalition.

In 2006, he published his first autobiographical book, &quot;Reduce&quot; (&quot;Returned/Survivor&quot;), in which he describes his new poetics and views on life through childhood memories, poems and invectives against the contemporary world. He accompanied the release of the book with a new show of the same name, featuring the same artists he had previously worked with on &quot;Pascolare parole, allevare pensieri&quot;.

Concerning his conversion to Roman Catholicism, he has said, &quot;I was raised by my grandmother and parents as a Catholic. But I was also a child of the 1960s and I voluntarily adhered to communism, that pestilence of the soul that stole the best children from our families. In a certain sense I have returned home. But I cannot bear the idea of being an anti-communist with the same stupidity and spite as when I was an atheist and blasphemer. I want a bit more dignity than that.&quot;

His association with the Catholic organisation Communion and Liberation, led to his participation in their 2007 festival in Rimini, where he spoke at a meeting about the Priestly Fraternity of the Missionaries of St.Charles Borromeo.

Since Sunday 4 September 2011, he has been the author of a column on &quot;Avvenire&quot;, an Italian Catholic newspaper published by the Italian Episcopal Conference.

Lindo Ferretti currently lives in his native village, where he is a horse breeder.

<text>A rollover or overturn is a type of vehicle crash in which a vehicle tips over onto its side or roof. Rollovers have a higher fatality rate than other types of vehicle collisions.

==Dynamics==

Vehicle rollovers are divided into two categories: tripped and untripped. Tripped rollovers are caused by forces from an external object, such as a curb or a collision with another vehicle. Untripped rollovers are the result of steering input, speed, and friction with the ground. Trailers that are not roll-coupled (i.e. those that use a trailer coupling rather than a fifth wheel) are more prone to rolling as they do not have the tractor unit or prime mover for additional stability.

===Untripped rollovers===
Untripped rollovers occur when cornering forces destabilize the vehicle. As a vehicle rounds a corner, three forces act on it: tire forces (the centripetal force), inertial effects (the centrifugal force), and gravity. The cornering forces from the tire push the vehicle towards the center of the curve. This force acts at ground level, below the center of mass. The force of inertia acts horizontally through the vehicle&#x27;s center of mass away from the center of the turn. These two forces make the vehicle roll towards the outside of the curve. The force of the vehicle&#x27;s weight acts downward through the center of mass in the opposite direction. When the tire and inertial forces are enough to overcome the force of gravity, the vehicle starts to turn over.

===Tripped rollovers===
The most common type of tripped rollover in light passenger vehicles occurs when a vehicle is sliding sideways, and the tires strike a curb, dig into soft ground, or a similar event occurs that results in a sudden increase in lateral force. The physics are similar to cornering rollovers. In a 2003 report, this was the most common mechanism, accounting for 71% of single-vehicle rollovers.

Another type of tripped rollover occurs due to a collision with another vehicle or object. These occur when the collision causes the vehicle to become unstable, such as when a narrow object causes one side of the vehicle to accelerate upwards, but not the other. Turned down guard rail end sections have been shown to do this. A side impact can accelerate a vehicle sideways. The tires resist the change, and the coupled forces rotate the vehicle. In 1983, crash tests showed that light trucks were prone to rolling over after colliding with certain early designs of guide rail.

A rollover can also occur as a vehicle crosses a ditch or slope. Slopes steeper than 33% (one vertical unit rise or fall per three horizontal units) are called &quot;critical slopes&quot; because they can cause most vehicles to overturn. A vehicle may roll over when hitting a large obstacle with one of its wheels or when maneuvering over uneven terrain. A trailer jackknife can push the towing vehicle into a rollover scenario if the vehicle is subject to a tripped scenario (soft ground or a curb).

Strong winds may cause high-sided vehicles such as trucks, buses and vans to be blown over. Risk areas are coastal roads, plains and exposed bridges. Vehicles exiting a wind shadow can be subjected to instant gusts that can affect high-sided vehicles.

== Vehicles ==
All vehicles are susceptible to rollovers to various extents. Generally, rollover tendency increases with the height of the center of mass, narrowness of the axle track, steering sensitivity, and increased speed.

The rollover threshold for passenger cars is over 1 g of lateral acceleration. Light trucks will roll over at lateral accelerations of 0.8 to 1.2 g. Large commercial trucks will roll at lateral accelerations as low as 0.2 g. Trucks are more likely to roll over than passenger cars because they usually have taller bodies and higher ground clearance. This raises the center of mass.

SUVs are prone to rollover, especially those outfitted with long travel off-road suspensions. The increased suspension height for increased clearance off-road raises the center of mass.

Full-size vans don&#x27;t usually have off-road suspensions, but their increased body height makes them more prone to tip. Fifteen passenger vans such as the Ford E-Series (at 27.9%), are particularly notorious for rolling over because their height is increased by the heavy-duty suspensions necessary to carry large numbers of people. The rollover tendency is increased when the vehicles are heavily loaded. It is recommended to not load anything on the roof of such vans, and to use drivers experienced or trained in safe operation of the vehicle. In such cases, familiarity with the vehicle&#x27;s behavior loaded and unloaded, avoiding sudden swerving maneuvers, and reducing speed through tight turns can greatly decrease the rollover risk associated with these vehicles.

Manufacturers of SUVs often post warnings on the driver&#x27;s sun-visor. Among the vehicles which have received publicity for tendencies to roll over are the Ford Bronco II, Suzuki Samurai, Jeep CJ, Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, and Isuzu Trooper.

Military vehicles have a much wider wheel track than civilian SUVs, making them more difficult to roll over. However, IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan cause roll overs not seen by civilian vehicles. The top turret gunner is particularly vulnerable.

A tall passenger coach made US headlines when 15 passengers were killed in New York in 2011. The bus swerved, flipped on its side and hit a pole which split off the top of the vehicle.

== Exit ==

After a rollover, the vehicle may end up lying on its side or roof, often blocking the doors and complicating the escape for the passengers. Large passenger vehicles such as buses, trams, and trolley buses that have doors on one side only usually have one or more methods of using windows for escape in case of a rollover. Some have special windows with handles to pull so that windows can be used as an emergency exit. Some have tools for breaking the windows and making an improvised exit. Some have emergency exit door or hatches in their roofs or on the opposite side of the bus to the usual entry door. Some combine two or more of these escape methods.

== Roll bars and cages ==
Rollover crashes are particularly deadly for the occupants of a vehicle when compared to frontal, side, or rear crashes, because in normal passenger vehicles, the roof is likely to collapse in towards the occupants and cause severe head injuries. The use of roll cages in vehicles would make them much safer, but in most passenger vehicles their use would cut cargo and passenger space so much that their use is not practical. The Jeep Wrangler, a vehicle which is short, narrow, and designed to be used on uneven terrain, is unusual in that it comes with a roll bar as standard equipment.

The decline in popularity of convertibles in the US was partly caused by concern about lack of protection in rollover accidents, because most convertibles have no protection beyond the windshield frame. Some convertibles provide rollover protection using two protruding curved bars behind the headrests. Some Mercedes-Benz convertibles have a retractable roll bar which deploys in case of an accident. Race cars almost always have roll cages, since racing is very likely to result in a rollover. In addition, the roll cage&#x27;s chassis-stiffening effect is usually seen as a benefit to the car.

== Warning signs ==
Some countries have a unique traffic warning sign for curves and other areas with an increased danger of rollover for trucks and other vehicles with high centers of gravity. These signs may include an advisory safe speed to avoid rolling over. This speed is typically set by measuring a maximum g-force permitted around the corner to remain well under the maximum static roll threshold.

In the UK, the &quot;adverse camber&quot; plate comes with a warning sign such as &quot;roundabout ahead&quot;, &quot;bend ahead&quot;, &quot;junction on (...) a bend ahead&quot;, or &quot;series of bends ahead&quot;.

==Europe==

Inside the European union, most rollovers occur off the carriageway. When the occupant is not ejected from the vehicle and the car does not strike any rigid objects, rollovers are the least injurious of the different impact types, because deceleration is longer and slower.

Nonetheless, rollover risk depends upon the centre of gravity, suspension characteristics and loads carried.
The severity of injury depends on the presence of crash-protective roadsides and the speed of impact.
In most of western Europe over 3,5 tonnes HGV have a speed limited from 80 km/h or 90 km/h, except in Great-Britain and Northern Ireland and Italy, Romania and Bulgaria which have HGV speed limit up to 110 km/h. In France, HGV can reach 90 km/h on the motorway network and some other roads but are limited to the 80 km/h general speed limit of the local/secondary road network.

It is considered that Electronic Stability Programmes can contribute to reduce some accidents including rollovers.

=== Differences between European and US rollover ===

===European HGVs ===
Within European union, it is considered that HGV rollovers do not usually result in serious injury.

Some European trucks have no ESC.

In Sweden one to two rollover accidents occur every day.

===European double-decker bus ===

In France, several double-decker bus performed rollover making BEATT to recommend regulation improvement to make ESC mandatory, while seat belt has become mandatory in the meantime:
* on 10 July 1995 at one o&#x27;clock on motorway A9 a double-decker bus going from Barcelone, Spain, to Amsterdam, Netherlands. 22 killed, 32 hurt.
* in the 17 May 2003 morning, a double-decker bus going from Germany to Costa-Brava, Spain. 28 killed
* on 11 September 2012 at 8h07, a 4 meters height and 12 meters long, 72 seats double-decker bus going from Poland to southern France perform a rollover on the A36 motorway with ABS but without ESC at 97 km/h and then 40 km/h speed. Seat-belt were missing. 2 killed, 42 hurt. The bus is destroyed.
* In December 2019, a double-decker bus perform a rollover on Técou, near Gaillac, Tarn, but people are protected by their seat-belt.
This led to European regulation (CE) 661/2009 and to UNECE regulation 66 revision to take into account such an issue.

== United States ==
In the US, rollover fatalities represents respectively %, % and % of fatalities in 1994, 2003 and 2004.

Single-vehicle rollover fatalities represents respectively 82%, 82% and 81% of all rollover fatalities in 1994, 2003 and 2004.

US States &amp; Territories where rollover includes a bigger part of fatalities includes:
* Wyoming: 69%, 57% and 66%
* Montana: 57%, 63% and 67%
* New Mexico: 57%, 62% and 53%

US States &amp; Territories where rollover includes a lower part of fatalities includes:
* Puerto Rico: 10%, 14% and 12%
* Mississippi: 15%, 17% and 18%
* District of Columbia: 29%, 7% and 10%

== Competition ==
A skilled driver may stop a rollover by stopping a turn. Stunt drivers deliberately use ramps to launch a rollover. Vehicles with a high center of gravity are easily upset or &quot;rolled.&quot; Short of a rollover, stunt drivers may also drive the car on two wheels for some time, but this requires precise planning and expert driver control. Specialized safety equipment is often utilized.

=== Rollover contest ===
The driver deliberately drives one side of their vehicle onto a ramp which causes their vehicle to roll over. The winner is the driver who guides their vehicle to the most rolls.

<text>Hósvík () is a village in the Faroe Islands. It has a population of 324 and is located on a bay on Streymoy&#x27;s east-coast.

The ferry to Selatrað on Eysturoy island used to go from Hósvík, but was superseded by the Streymin Bridge between the islands.

Hósvík was at one point called Thórsvík or Thors Bay, but was renamed to Hósvík. It was called Thors Bay because of the founder, who was believed to be called Tórhallur.

Hósvík is the current home of Krás, a food production facility which delivers to almost all of the shops in the Faroe Islands. Hósvík is also the home of one of the biggest if not the biggest asphalt storage tanks in the Faroe Islands.

Until 2003 Hósvík was run by an independent local council, but following the local election in 2003 it became a part of the larger Sunda Kommuna.

The church in Hósvík dates from 1929.

Hósvík is also the home city of the shipping company Thor Shipping, which is the largest in the Faroe Islands.

Hósvíkar Róðrarfelag is the local rowing club. It has won 4 faroease championships, the latest one in 2020

<text>Willibrord Benzler OSB (16 October 1853 – 16 April 1921) was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Metz from 1901 to 1919.

==Life==
Born as Karl Heinrich Johann Eugen Benzler in Niederhemer, Westphalia, the eldest son of Karl Benzler, an innkeeper, and his wife, Klementine (née Kissing), he was baptized at SS Peter and Paul Church on 24 October 1853. After attending the elementary school in Niederhemer and the &quot;höhere Bürgerschule&quot; in Menden, he went on to study at the secondary school in Attendorn, and (from 1867 to 1871) at the gymnasium Paulinium in Münster, where he graduated.

After beginning to study architecture in Cologne, in December 1871 he changed to study philosophy and Catholic theology at the University of Innsbruck. In the autumn of 1872 he joined the Collegium Canisianum maintained by the Jesuits; however, his application to join the order was denied in 1874. Instead he joined the Benedictine abbey of Beuron and chose the name Willibrord. On 28 August 1877 he was ordained to the priesthood by Johann Baudri, auxiliary bishop of Cologne.

During the Kulturkampf the monks of Beuron were forced to leave the country. From 1875 to 1880 they stayed in Volders (Tyrol). In 1880 they were invited to revive the Emaus Abbey in Prague. From 1883 to 1887 he was prior of Seckau Abbey in Styria, which had been revived as a priory of Beuron. In 1887 the monks were able to return to their monastery in Beuron, where he became prior. In 1892 Maria Laach Abbey was refounded by the monks of Beuron, and Willibrord Benzler became its prior. On 15 October 1893 the priory was made an abbey, and he became the first abbot. On 8 December he was consecrated as abbot by Wilhelm von Reiser, Bishop of Rottenburg.

Even though Benzler had earlier been discussed as a possible bishop of Cologne or Fulda, his appointment as bishop of Metz on 21 September 1901 was somewhat surprising. He was ordained on 28 October 1901 by Michael Felix Korum, bishop of Trier.

After World War I the diocese of Metz became French again, and a German bishop was no longer acceptable; Benzler therefore resigned in January 1919. His resignation was officially accepted on 10 July; on 31 July he was appointed archbishop of the titular see of Attalia in Pamphylia. He returned to his abbey in Maria Laach and later to Beuron, but a serious heart disease forced him to move to the Cistercian abbey of Lichtenthal near Baden-Baden to receive medical help. In 1921 he died there, and was buried at his first abbey in Beuron.

== Coat of arms ==

The bishopric coat of arms of Willibrord Benzler showed on the heraldic right side three silver fish on blue ground, while to the left it had a red cross of Lorraine with the word &quot;PAX&quot; (peace). The origin of the three hills to the bottom of the cross is unknown, they might have been a reference to his hometown in the hills of the Sauerland. Below the shield is the motto of Bishop Benzler, &quot;In verbo tuo&quot; (Following your word).

<text>Armitage is a village in Staffordshire, England on the south side of the Trent and Mersey Canal south just outside of the market town of Rugeley and north of the city of Lichfield, and noteworthy for the Armitage Shanks sanitary porcelain factory. With the adjacent village of Handsacre, it forms the parish of Armitage with Handsacre. The area of Armitage with Handsacre had a population of 5,335 at the 2011 Census.

==Amenities==
Armitage has a variety of village amenities including a Londis, a fishing shop, a newspaper shop, and the Croft Primary School. Armitage is also the home of Armitage Shanks. Its parish church, St. John the Baptist church, is located at the north end of the village. The organ of St John the Baptist church is of particular interest due to its size, age and history. The organ was built in 1789 for nearby Lichfield Cathedral, but moved here in 1865, commissioned by the then organist Josiah Spode (IV) who resided at nearby Hawkesyard estate, also known as Spode House. Armitage is served by Chaserider bus services 826 and 828 connecting to Lichfield, Rugeley and Stafford.

==Etymology and location==
The name comes from the Middle English &quot;Ermitage&quot;, meaning &#x27;Hermitage&#x27;, in turn derived from the Old French &quot;ermitage&quot;, from a tradition that a hermit lived between the church and the River Trent.
It does not appear in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, although Handsacre does.

Armitage is now part of Armitage with Handsacre, although this is due to growth—historically they were once separate villages. It lies close to Hill Ridware along with the Hamstall Ridware, Mavesyn Ridware, Pipe Ridware and Longdon. It lies close to the town of Rugeley and a few miles north of Lichfield. It is located on the West Coast Main Line, the nearest stop being Rugeley. With continuous growth in the area Armitage and Rugeley are growing closer together.

<doc id="1148726" wikidata="Q57223" url="?curid=1148726" title="Stollen">
<text>Stollen ( or ) is a fruit bread of nuts, spices, and dried or candied fruit, coated with powdered sugar or icing sugar and often containing marzipan. It is a traditional German Christmas bread. During the Christmas season the cake-like loaves are called Weihnachtsstollen (after &quot;Weihnachten&quot;, the German word for Christmas) or Christstollen (after Christ). A ring-shaped stollen made in a Bundt cake or Gugelhupf pan is called a &quot;Stollenkranz&quot; (stollen wreath).

==Ingredients==
Stollen is a cake-like fruit bread made with yeast, water and flour, and usually with zest added to the dough. Orangeat (candied orange peel) and candied citrus peel (Zitronat), raisins and almonds, and various spices such as cardamom and cinnamon are added. Other ingredients, such as milk, sugar, butter, salt, rum, eggs, vanilla, other dried fruits and nuts and marzipan, may also be added to the dough. Except for the fruit added, the dough is quite low in sugar. The finished bread is sprinkled with icing sugar. The traditional weight of a stollen is around , but smaller sizes are common. The bread is slathered with melted unsalted butter and rolled in sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven, resulting in a moister product that keeps better. The marzipan rope in the middle is optional. The dried fruits are macerated in rum or brandy for a superior-tasting bread.

Dresden stollen (originally Striezel), a moist, heavy bread filled with fruit, was first mentioned in an official document in 1474, and &quot;Dresdner stollen&quot; remains notable and available – amongst other places – at the Dresden Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt. Dresden stollen is produced in the city of Dresden and distinguished by a special seal depicting King Augustus II the Strong. This &quot;official&quot; stollen is produced in only 110 Dresden bakeries.

==History==

Early stollen was different from the modern version, with the ingredients being flour, oats and water. As a Christmas bread, stollen was baked for the first time at the Saxon Royal Court in 1427, and was made with flour, yeast, oil and water.

The Advent season was a time of fasting, and bakers were not allowed to use butter, only oil, and the cake was tasteless and hard. In the 15th century, in medieval Saxony (in central Germany, north of Bavaria and south of Brandenburg), the Prince Elector Ernst (1441–1486) and his brother Duke Albrecht (1443–1500) decided to remedy this by writing to the Pope in Rome. The Saxon bakers needed to use butter, as oil in Saxony was expensive, hard to come by, and had to be made from turnips.

Pope Nicholas V (1397–1455), in 1450 denied the first appeal. Five popes died before finally, in 1490, Pope Innocent VIII (1432–1492) sent a letter, known as the &quot;Butter-Letter&quot;, to the prince&#x27;s successor. This granted the use of butter (without having to pay a fine), but only for the Prince-Elector and his family and household.

Others were also permitted to use butter, but on the condition of having to pay annually 1/20 of a gold coin to support the building of the Freiberg Minster. The papal restriction on the use of butter was removed when Saxony became Protestant.

Over the centuries, the bread changed from being a simple, fairly tasteless &quot;bread&quot; to a sweeter bread with richer ingredients, such as marzipan, although traditional stollen is not as sweet, light, and airy as the copies made around the world.

In the GDR, Dresden stollen were sent to West Germany as a way of thanking the citizens of West Germany for sending care packets (Westpaket), as they were both available to the GDR citizens and of a high enough standard to be appreciated as gifts.

Commercially made stollen has become a popular Christmas food in Britain in recent decades, complementing traditional dishes such as mince pies and Christmas pudding. All the major supermarkets sell their own versions, many made in Germany, and it is often baked by home bakers.

==Dresden stollen festival==
Every year the Stollenfest takes place in Dresden. This historic tradition ended only in 1918 with the fall of the monarchy, and started again in 1994, but the idea comes from Dresden&#x27;s history.

Dresden&#x27;s Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt, was mentioned in the chronicles for the first time in 1474.

The tradition of baking Christmas stollen in Dresden is very old. Christmas stollen in Dresden was already baked in the 15th century.

In 1560, the bakers of Dresden offered the rulers of Saxony Christmas stollen weighing each as gifts, and the custom continued.

Augustus II the Strong (1670–1733) was the Elector of Saxony, King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. The king loved pomp, luxury, splendour and feasts. In 1730, he impressed his subjects, ordering the Bakers’ Guild of Dresden to make a giant 1.7-tonne stollen, big enough for everyone to have a portion to eat. There were around 24,000 guests taking part in the festivities on the occasion of the legendary amusement festivity known as Zeithainer Lustlager. For this special occasion, the court architect Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann (1662–1737), built a particularly oversized stollen oven. An oversized stollen knife was also designed solely for this occasion.

Today, the festival takes place on the Saturday before the second Sunday in Advent, and the cake weighs between three and four tonnes. A carriage takes the cake in a parade through the streets of Dresden to the Christmas market, where it is ceremoniously cut into pieces and distributed among the crowd, in return for a small payment which goes to charity. A special knife, the Grand Dresden Stollen Knife, a silver-plated knife, long weighing , which is a copy of the lost baroque original knife from 1730, is used to cut the oversize stollen at the Dresden Christmas fair.
The largest stollen was baked in 2010 by Lidl; it was long and was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records, at the railway station of Haarlem.

<text>Johannes Franciscus &quot;Jos&quot; Verstappen (; born 4 March 1972) is a Dutch former racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and .

Born and raised in Dutch Limburg, Verstappen began competitive kart racing aged eight. After a successful karting career—culminating in two direct-drive Karting European Championships in 1989—Verstappen graduated to junior formulae. He started his career in Formula Opel Lotus, winning the Benelux Championship in 1992. Later that year, he also won the EFDA Nations Cup, representing the Netherlands. Progressing to German Formula Three in 1993, Verstappen won the title in his rookie season with Opel, further winning the Masters of Formula 3.

Signing for Benetton as a test driver in , Verstappen made his Formula One debut at the , replacing the injured JJ Lehto to partner Michael Schumacher for the opening two rounds of the season. Verstappen formally replaced Lehto after the , scoring two podiums in his rookie season before being replaced by Johnny Herbert in Japan. His podium in Hungary made him the first Dutch driver to score a podium finish in Formula One. Verstappen competed for Simtek in before the team went bankrupt five rounds into the season, returning to his test driver role with Benetton. He became a full-time driver for Footwork in . After non-classified championship finishes in and with Tyrrell and Stewart, respectively, Verstappen became a test driver for the Honda project in . He returned to a race seat with Arrows in , competing with them for a further two seasons. After a year hiatus, Verstappen completed his final Formula One season with Minardi in .

Following his departure, Verstappen moved to A1 Grand Prix with the Netherlands for the 2005–06 season, achieving his sole victory in the South Africa feature race. He then competed in sportscar racing in 2008, winning both the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Le Mans Series in the LMP2 class with Van Merksteijn. In rallying, he contested the 2022 Ypres Rally as an independent entrant. Since 2002, Verstappen has coached and managed his son Max from karting at an early age to winning four Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles. Max&#x27;s successes in the sport have renewed public scrutiny of Verstappen, who has faced several allegations of assault spanning two decades.

==Early career==
Verstappen began karting at the age of 8, and was participating in national competitions not long after. In 1984 he became Dutch junior champion. Verstappen remained successful, becoming a two-class Karting European Champion in 1989, a feat that remained unmatched until his son Max in 2013.

At the end of 1991 he made the transition to car racing. He drove in Formula Opel Lotus, a class in which identical cars compete against each other. He won the European championship in his first year, and got an offer to drive in Formula Three with Van Amersfoort Racing, who also developed other drivers such as Christijan Albers, Tom Coronel and Bas Leinders. During that European winter season, he raced in New Zealand Formula Atlantic. Subsequently, in German Formula Three, he won several international competitions, including the 1993 Marlboro Masters and the German Formula 3 championship.

==Formula One==

===1994: Benetton===
Verstappen first drove a Formula One car when he tested for the Footwork Arrows team alongside Gil de Ferran and Christian Fittipaldi at the Estoril circuit in Portugal. The test took place on 28 September 1993, two days after the Portuguese Grand Prix was held at the same circuit. Despite the large increase in power (from a 175 bhp Formula Three car to the 750 bhp of Formula One), Verstappen set a time that would have qualified him in the preceding race on his fourth timed lap, and improved his time by more than a second after 65 laps. His best lap time of the day was 1:14.45, which was only 0.07 seconds slower than regular driver Derek Warwick had lapped during qualifying, and would have placed him tenth on the grid. He tested again on September 30 and was lapping near his existing record after five laps, but then crashed the car, ending the test early.

After the test, Verstappen was contacted by every Formula One team except Ferrari and Williams, and was eventually signed as the Benetton team&#x27;s test driver for the 1994 season.

After a crash in pre-season testing by regular driver JJ Lehto (who broke a vertebra), Verstappen drove in the first two races of the season as a substitute, partnering Michael Schumacher and made his Formula One debut at the 1994 Brazilian Grand Prix. During the race he collided with Eddie Irvine, which triggered a multiple accident also involving Éric Bernard and Martin Brundle. Verstappen&#x27;s car somersaulted, but he emerged unharmed. At the Pacific Grand Prix Verstappen ran 6th but spun off on cold tyres immediately after a pit stop. Lehto was fit for the next race at Imola, but his performances in subsequent races were disappointing and he was rested by Benetton following the Canadian Grand Prix, allowing Verstappen to return to the race seat.

One of the most dramatic incidents affected Verstappen at the German Grand Prix. During his first scheduled pitstop during the race, fuel leaked onto the car after the fuel hose was disconnected. The car, with Verstappen in it, was engulfed in flames for several seconds. As was usual at the time, Verstappen had slightly opened the visor of his helmet for the pit stop, but apart from slight burns to his nose, he was uninjured. After this incident the fuel delivery hose was modified to incorporate a fail-safe cut-out system.

A high point in this season was Verstappen&#x27;s third place during the next Grand Prix in Hungary, Schumacher having allowed Verstappen to unlap himself on the final lap to pass Martin Brundle&#x27;s stricken McLaren-Peugeot. He took another third place at the Belgian Grand Prix due to Schumacher&#x27;s post-race disqualification from victory, and a fifth place at the Portuguese Grand Prix. A curiosity was his accident during a practice session for the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours, in which Verstappen rammed his car into the pit wall causing debris to fly up and destroy a TV installation. Due to this accident, this equipment is now protected from the race track by acrylic glass.

For the last two races of the season, Verstappen was replaced by the more experienced Johnny Herbert in a bid to win the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Benetton. Although the team was unsuccessful in this aim, losing out to the rival Williams team, Herbert was signed for the 1995 season instead of Verstappen.

===1995: Simtek===
In he was loaned to Simtek by Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore. Despite some strong showings (including running 6th at the Argentine Grand Prix before a poor pit stop and subsequent gearbox failure) Verstappen only finished once in the five races he drove for the team due to technical difficulties. The team had deep financial troubles and went bankrupt after the Monaco Grand Prix. Out of a race drive, Verstappen did some test driving with Benetton and Ligier (then part-owned by Briatore and Tom Walkinshaw). Briatore decided against taking up his option for Verstappen in 1996, signing Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger to drive instead.

===1996: Footwork Arrows===
In he drove for the Footwork team. He ran fifth at Interlagos before retiring, and finished sixth in Buenos Aires. Shortly after, the team was taken over by Walkinshaw&#x27;s TWR organisation. During the Belgian Grand Prix a part of the suspension of Verstappen&#x27;s car broke off, causing him to crash heavily. He ended up with a prolonged neck injury. Initially Verstappen featured strongly in Walkinshaw&#x27;s plans for 1997 (the new owner at one point threatening to replace him with a pay driver unless he signed for another season) but the surprise availability of Damon Hill (soon to be crowned World Champion) saw him dropped instead. His form in the second half of the season dropped off as development on the 1996 car ground to a standstill, TWR Arrows focusing instead on 1997.

===1997: Tyrrell===
In he went to the Tyrrell team but did not score any points, though he briefly ran fifth in the Canadian Grand Prix. The team suffered from an underpowered Ford Cosworth EDV V8 engine and a lack of funding leaving Verstappen and teammate Mika Salo struggling towards the rear of the field. Verstappen&#x27;s best result for the team was eighth at the wet Monaco Grand Prix. Before the 1998 season Tyrrell were sold to British American Tobacco, who intended to rebrand the team as British American Racing in 1999 after one final season under the Tyrrell banner. Ken Tyrrell wanted to retain Verstappen alongside Toranosuke Takagi but BAR insisted on taking pay driver Ricardo Rosset alongside the young Japanese driver. Tyrrell himself left the team in disgust over the matter, leaving Dr. Harvey Postlethwaite to run the team.

===1998: Stewart===

Out of a regular drive for 1998, Verstappen tested for Benetton once again early in the year, but the team would not hire him as a permanent test driver for lack of sponsors. As an experienced, fast free agent Verstappen was a common name mentioned in pit lane gossip as a replacement for underperforming drivers. He would eventually return to the series at the French Grand Prix, replacing Jan Magnussen at Stewart. However, the car was uncompetitive, the team struggled to run two cars to the same level and Verstappen did not perform significantly better than his predecessor. Johnny Herbert was signed to partner Rubens Barrichello for 1999 and Verstappen was left casting around for a drive again.

===1999: Honda===

However, for once it looked like things were going in the right direction for Verstappen. Near the end of 1998 he became the test driver for the Honda Formula One project. He teamed up with old Tyrrell friends Rupert Manwaring and Harvey Postlethwaite, planning to test the new car in 1999 and join the series in 2000. All went well for the operation, with the testing hack showing well against upper-midfield teams such as Benetton and Williams in various test sessions until Postlethwaite died of a heart attack. Not long after, Honda changed their plans from becoming a team to a works engine supplier and Verstappen was again without a Formula One seat. He tested for the Jordan team in case Damon Hill decided to retire before the end of the season but this came to nothing when Verstappen&#x27;s testing performance was underwhelming and Hill resolved to see out the season.

===2000–2001: Return to Arrows===

In he returned to Arrows, who had put together a package including Supertec engines, a chassis with good straight-line speed and a bevy of sponsors. The car proved to be unreliable, but its speed allowed Verstappen and teammate Pedro de la Rosa to dice with the front runners at several circuits. The design&#x27;s small fuel tank meant the cars were often lighter than their rivals. In his second race back at Interlagos he ran 6th before spinning due to a sore neck brought on by his lack of recent seat time. In the wet/dry Canadian Grand Prix, he drove superbly in the later stages to move into 5th position and score his first points since 1996. After the first corner accidents in Austria de la Rosa and Verstappen ran 4th and 5th but mechanical problems sidelined them both. Verstappen would score only once again, a strong 4th place at Monza.

For 2001 he was retained by Arrows. The Supertec engines were replaced by Asiatech units and de la Rosa was dropped on the eve of the season for the Red Bull-backed Enrique Bernoldi. The package was more reliable and competitive on average beating Verstappen in qualifying on pace (often lining up behind his rookie teammate on the grid). Verstappen was hurt on occasion by indifferent qualifying form. Highlights of the season included running 2nd at Sepang having started 18th, making a superb start and running well in changing conditions before dropping to 7th and later scoring the team&#x27;s only point of the year for 6th at the A1-Ring. At Interlagos, he ran into the back of leader Juan Pablo Montoya just after being lapped while at Montreal, he moved into the top six but retired with brake failure.

He re-signed to drive for Arrows in 2002, but was dropped at the eleventh hour in favour of Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Later that year he almost signed a test contract with Sauber but he turned out to be physically too large for the car, which was smaller than its predecessor.

===2003: Minardi===

He returned to the cockpit in 2003 with Paul Stoddart&#x27;s European Minardi team, considered the tail enders of the grid. With limited funds and underpowered engines it was a difficult season with little opportunity to shine. His best result was 9th at the Canadian Grand Prix, one place away from a point under the new scoring system. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, he had been running ahead of eventual winner Giancarlo Fisichella on the same strategy only to spin off on standing water, but generally the year was one to forget – and many noted that Verstappen was largely outperformed by rookie teammate Justin Wilson. At the French Grand Prix, Verstappen recorded his and Minardi&#x27;s only provisional pole position in the first qualifying session by running last on a rapidly-drying track; in the second, dry qualifying session, Verstappen qualified on the team&#x27;s usual back row. Saturday qualifying, due to wet weather At the end of the year he left the Italian team because he did not feel like driving in the rear-guard for another year.

Out of a drive for 2004 Verstappen was considered as a replacement for Giorgio Pantano at Jordan partway through the season but was unable to fit in the car and began looking for drives outside Formula One for the following season.

Verstappen participated in 107 Grands Prix. He achieved two podium places, and scored a total of 17 championship points (117 in the modern system) which makes him the second best performing Dutch driver in Formula One to date, beaten only by his son, Max. Jos Verstappen&#x27;s highest qualifying position was 6th, at the 1994 Belgian Grand Prix.

== A1 Grand Prix ==

After two years of not participating in races, Verstappen was confirmed in July as driver of the A1 Team Netherlands managed by seatholder Jan Lammers&#x27;s Racing for Holland, for the A1 Grand Prix series. They won the feature race at Durban.

On 27 September 2006, Verstappen split with A1 Team Netherlands after failing to secure payment guarantees. This resulted from Verstappen only being paid for the 2005/06 season a few weeks before the next season started. He was replaced by Jeroen Bleekemolen for the first race of the 2006/07 season at the team&#x27;s home race at Zandvoort.

== Le Mans Series ==

In December 2007, Verstappen announced that he would take part in the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans race, as well as enter the 1,000 kilometre races in the Le Mans Series. Driving a LMP2-class Porsche RS Spyder fielded by Van Merksteijn Motorsport, Verstappen was partnered by team owner Peter van Merksteijn Sr. Jeroen Bleekemolen also joined the team for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race.

After winning the 1000km Catalunya and 1000km Spa, and finishing second in the 1000km Monza, Jos Verstappen won the LMP2 class of the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans. With his victory at the 1000km Nurburgring, Verstappen clinched the LMP2 Drivers&#x27; title and Van Merksteijn Motorsport won the LMP2 Manufacturers&#x27; title.

Verstappen participated in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Lola-Aston Martin.

==Personal life==

Verstappen speaks Dutch, English and German.

In 1996, Verstappen married Belgian ex-kart driver champion Sophie Kumpen, whose cousin is NASCAR Whelen Euro Series racing driver Anthony Kumpen, and whose uncle is former motocross and GT endurance rally driver Paul Kumpen. Verstappen and Sophie had two children, Max (b. 1997) and Victoria (b. 1999). He has a second daughter, Blue Jaye (b. 2014), with his second wife Kelly van der Waal. He also has a second son, Jason Jaxx (b. 2019) and third daughter Mila Faye (b. 2020), with his third wife Sandy Sijtsma. Both Max and Victoria have gone on to become racing drivers, with Max becoming a four-time Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion, in 2021, 2022, , and .

Starting in 2002, Verstappen coached and managed Max in kart racing at an early age. Jos&#x27; parenting of his son has been described by some in Formula One as either &quot;tough love&quot; or child abuse. Some of them allege Jos physically beat Max multiple times, once at a kart race to punish him for not performing better. Contrarily, Jos says he made his son&#x27;s kart perform worse and told him false rules about races because Max was &quot;winning so easily&quot;. Jos also says he made Max drive karts when Max was unable to, such as when it was freezing cold once: “he couldn’t move his fingers [to drive] and I didn’t care.&quot; [...] &quot;When the fingers warm up again that’s very painful. I said, &#x27;Ah, shut up.&#x27;&quot; Max says that in 2012, when they both competed in a kart race, Max crashed and damaged his own kart while attempting to overtake his father; while Jos drove him home, Jos abandoned him at a fuel station and drove on for some time before returning to retrieve him. Once home, Jos did not speak to him for a week. Jos has denied that he abused Max, who, journalist Erik van Haren reports, publicly has a good relationship with his father.

When Max Verstappen was teammates with Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull Racing, the team released a promo video of the two having a conversation. In it, Ricciardo playfully made a stabbing motion at a table, to which Max responded, &quot;My dad did that once [to] a mechanic with a fork&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; writes that Ricciardo&#x27;s surprised reaction suggests Max was serious.

==Legal issues==
After a 1998 incident at a karting track in which a man suffered a fractured skull, Verstappen and his father, Frans, were found guilty in court of assault but were each given a five-year suspended jail sentence after reaching an out-of-court settlement with the victim.

In December 2008, after Verstappen and Sophie Kumpen were effectively separated, he appeared in court in Tongeren, Belgium, charged with assaulting her. He was found not guilty of assault, but guilty of threatening her in text messages and of violating a previously issued restraining order. He was fined and sentenced to three months probational, suspended prison sentence. In January 2009, Verstappen again had to appear in court and was convicted to a three months suspended prison sentence and a 1650 Euro fine for sending Kumpen threats and visiting her house despite the restraining order.

On 29 November 2011, the media reported allegations that Verstappen had assaulted an unnamed 24 year old girlfriend in a hotel room in the Dutch city of Venlo; Verstappen claimed to only have had a discussion with her. In January 2012, he was arrested on attempted murder charges following accusations that he drove a car into his ex-girlfriend in Roermond - who was taken by ambulance to hospital with heavy bruises and abrasions. Verstappen was previously accused of beating his girlfriend. &quot;It&#x27;s definitely not the first time he does this,&quot; the unnamed woman told RTL television. &quot;I think now I need to go and hide -- I don&#x27;t know what to expect now when he is released.&quot; but released two weeks later after the charge was withdrawn. Verstappen was also accused of destroying two cell phones, jewellery and the handbag of his girlfriend, and he faced two weeks of imprisonment and 20 hours of community work service. Verstappen&#x27;s lawyer Geert Jan Knoops said his client was relieved and he hopes this will be the definitive end of the court case. According to Dutch sources, Verstappen and his girlfriend are back together again. He and his ex-girlfriend, Kelly van der Waal, got back together and were married in 2014. They have one daughter, Blue Jaye, born in September 2014. They divorced on 2 June 2017.

On 28 July 2016, it was reported that Verstappen physically attacked his own father, Dutchman Frans Verstappen in his hometown of Montford. According to the official report, it happened shortly after the 2016 Hungarian Grand Prix De Telegraaf, a large Dutch media group, said Frans Verstappen filed a complaint with the police. “We’ve seen before that Jos has loose hands but this was the limit,” Frans, showing multiple wounds and bruises on his body and head, is quoted as saying. “Jos is very bad tempered.” Manager Raymond Vermeulen said the incident was a “private matter”. Later, Limburg broadcaster L1 reported that Frans had withdrawn the complaint, with him stating, “It’s just a private matter between myself and Jos. I want to keep it between ourselves.”

<text>Edingale is a village and civil parish in Lichfield District, Staffordshire, England. It lies on the River Mease, around north of Tamworth. Historically, the village is shared with Derbyshire. In 2001 the parish had a population of 598, increasing to 632 at the 2011 census.

==History==
Edingale was mentioned in the Domesday Book as part of Derbyshire and belonging to Henry de Ferrers and being worth two shillings. The name of the village comes from Old English, with the meaning &quot;nook of land of Edin″s&quot; (or &quot;Eadwine″s&quot;) people&quot;.

Until the late 19th century the village of Edingale was divided between the chapelry of Edingale, within Alrewas parish in Staffordshire, and the parish of Croxall, in Derbyshire.

In 1831 the population of the Staffordshire village was 177. By 1851 it had risen to 197, on about 850 acres of land, when the lord of the manor was the Earl of Lichfield, though the land belonged to a number of other persons.

Formerly in Tamworth Rural District, the parish became part of Lichfield Rural District during the boundary changes of 1934. The civil parish of Croxall was incorporated into Edingale at the same time.

==Landmarks==
A number of houses in the village are listed Grade II, as is the Church of the Holy Trinity and associated buildings. The village of Croxall also has a number of historic buildings. Chetwynd Bridge, an early cast-iron arch bridge, crosses the River Tame from neighbouring Alrewas on the western edge of the parish.

==Sport==
The village has 1 football team Edingale Swifts. they will play the 2016–2017 season in Division 3 of the &quot;Tamworth and District Sunday Football League&quot;. They won the Division Three league and cup double in 2015–16 season with an unbeaten league record.

The Black Horse Edingale were the villages other football team but they folded in December 2013.

<doc id="1148773" wikidata="Q7142668" url="?curid=1148773" title="Passing lane">
<text>A passing lane (North American English), overtaking lane (English outside North America) is a lane on a multi-lane highway or motorway closest to the median of the road (the central reservation) used for passing vehicles in other lanes. (North American usage also calls the higher-speed lane nearest the median the &quot;inside lane&quot; but in the United Kingdom this is the &quot;outside lane&quot;.) Countries with right-hand traffic put the passing lane on the left; those with left-hand traffic put the passing lane on the right. Motorways typically have passing lanes along their entire length, but other roads might only have passing lanes for certain segments, depending on design specifications typically related to available space, funding, and traffic levels. A 2+1 road alternates the passing lane between directions every few kilometers/miles.

The passing lane is commonly referred to as the fast lane, and the lane closest to the shoulder the slow lane. Some jurisdictions, particularly on limited-access roads, ban passing-lane driving while not overtaking another vehicle; others merely require slower cars to yield to quicker traffic by shifting to slower lanes, or have no limitations.

On roads with only one lane in a given direction, overtaking is accomplished by briefly pulling into oncoming traffic. This is often prohibited by &quot;no passing&quot; signs and road markings on lengths of road where a hill or a curving road limit sight distances, and some jurisdictions ban this entirely. So-called suicide lanes provide a shared third center lane for passing in &quot;both&quot; directions, with the expectation that drivers will check for oncoming traffic before entering.

In modern traffic planning, passing lanes on freeways are usually designed for through/express traffic, while the lanes furthest from the median of the road have entry/exit ramps. However due to routing constraints, some freeways may have ramps exiting from the passing lane; these are known as &quot;left exits&quot; in North America.

==Misuse and common practice in the United States==

Common practice and most law on United States highways is that the left lane is reserved for passing and faster moving traffic, and that traffic using the left lane must yield to traffic wishing to overtake.

The United States Uniform Vehicle Code states:

Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic ...

It is also illegal in many states in the US to use the &quot;far left&quot; or passing lane on a major highway as a traveling lane (as opposed to passing), or to fail to yield to faster moving traffic that is attempting to overtake in that lane. For example, Colorado&#x27;s &quot;Left Lane Law&quot; states:

A person shall not drive a motor vehicle in the passing lane of a highway if the speed-limit is sixty-five miles per hour or more unless such person is passing other motor-vehicles that are in a non-passing lane...

In some states, such as Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, and Washington, the center lanes on highways with three or more lanes in each direction are also passing lanes. In those states, no matter how many lanes there are on the highway, drivers must not leave the right-hand lane unless they are overtaking slower vehicles, making a left turn or exit, or obeying a move over law.

California does not explicitly prohibit cruising in the left lane. However, it prohibits passing to the right and, similar to the states below, slow traffic must stay right.

In other states, such as Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and others, it is illegal to fail to yield to traffic that seeks to overtake in the left lane, or to create any other &quot;obstruction&quot; in the passing lane that hinders the flow of traffic. As a result, heavy trucks are often prohibited from using the passing lane.

The left lane is commonly referred to as the &quot;fast lane&quot;, but that is not an accurate description of the lane&#x27;s purpose. The left lane is the designated passing lane; however, vehicles in the left lane must obey the posted speed limits. A common problem arising from misuse of the left lane is speeding and tailgating. These actions create road rage and increase overall danger.

A driver hoping to pass a slow motorist in the &quot;fast lane&quot; can be stuck in an awkward situation. One strategy is to signal a lane change toward the center median. Another is to flash headlights. A third, which is dangerous and illegal, is to drive very close to the &quot;fast lane&quot; driver&#x27;s bumper (this is known as tailgating).

Most commonly, motorists will attempt to overtake the outer car on the inner lane either to continue at a fast pace or to pass a car that is going too slowly in the passing lane. On high-capacity multilane freeways (three or more lanes per direction), many motorists often pass on the inner lane, largely in response to misuse of the &quot;passing lane&quot; by slower traffic.

In some areas, such as the U.S. states of Colorado and Kentucky, vehicles in the left lane are required to yield to faster traffic only if the speed limit is above 65 miles per hour. In other areas, like Alaska, there is no law requiring slower traffic to move over for faster traffic.
===Signage===

The use of passing lanes for faster traffic is sometimes acknowledged with signs using phrases such as &quot;Slower Traffic Keep Right&quot; (in Canada, where the passing lane is to the left). In a study by the AASHTO Subcommittee on Traffic Engineering, all 24 U.S. states involved used some form of passing lane courtesy signage, 9 of which only use those signs for steep graded roads.

===Proper use===
Many areas which make it illegal to fail to yield to faster traffic also have exceptions to those rules. Some of these exceptions include preparing to make a left turn, taking an exit located on the left side of the roadway, avoiding traffic merging onto the roadway, or overtaking and passing another vehicle.

In the province of Quebec, it is illegal to travel in the left lane when not passing when the speed limit is over 80 km/h (50 mph).

Ontario&#x27;s Highway Traffic Act does spell out when the left-hand passing lane can be used. The act says the left lane should be left open for passing. Vehicles travelling slower than “the normal speed of traffic” must use the right lane.

Truckers often use the passing lane in moderate traffic where legal to do so to reduce travel times, however in many areas, tractor trailers are banned from using the passing lane for safety reasons; these restrictions are normally found along urban, often congested highways with multiple lanes (e.g. Interstate 40 west of Raleigh, North Carolina), or on rural freeways with 6 or more lanes (3 in each direction).

===Hammer lane===
The hammer lane is another term for the passing lane. Its etymology originated with truckers in North America in reference to slamming the accelerator with a foot like hammer. 

HOV lanes are not usually considered hammer lanes, but are also used for express travel by commuters.

==Climbing lane==
In hilly terrain, some highways have an additional &quot;climbing lane&quot; or &quot;crawler lane&quot; for the use of heavy or underpowered vehicles which climb hills more slowly than they traverse flat ground. For example, a highway with one travel lane in each direction would typically expand to two lanes for traffic proceeding uphill, retaining one lane for downhill traffic.

== Australian use ==
In Australia, most intercity highways are constructed with only one lane in each direction. Head-on collisions are a risk, particularly with fatigued drivers. Overtaking lanes are an additional lane in one direction for a short distance (one or two kilometres) (1/2 Miles) to assist faster traffic to safely overtake slower traffic. Road markings are often painted so that the additional lane appears in the centre of the road (guiding traffic to the left), and traffic needs to deliberately change lanes to overtake. At the end, the markings are the other way, so that the left lane must yield and merge into the overtaking lane. Large signs alert drivers that they are approaching an overtaking lane, often at 5 km (3 Miles) and 1 km (0.62 Mi) distances before the lane starts.

<text>Adderbury is a winding linear village and rural civil parish about south of Banbury in northern Oxfordshire, England. The settlement has five sections: the new Milton Road housing Development and West Adderbury, towards the southwest; East Adderbury to the centre, with a village green and a manor house; the new housing Development on the Aynho Road; the northeast, which is known as Twyford, named after a small outlying settlement by a forked section of the River Cherwell.

East and West Adderbury are divided by the south- then east-flowing Sor Brook, a tributary of the Cherwell. Sor Brook rises at Ratley and Upton in Warwickshire and joins the Cherwell between Adderbury and Aynho, Northamptonshire, the latter river being the eastern parish boundary. The Oxford Canal and beyond which the Cherwell characterise the far east of the parish. The M40 motorway passes close to the northeast of Adderbury near Twyford wharf. Banbury Business Park and Banbury Golf Course are also in the eastern part of the parish. Railways briefly pass through the easternmost river meander, the combined Chiltern Main and Cherwell Valley Lines.

==Toponym==
The village toponym has had several changes of spelling. The earliest known record of it is in a document from the middle of the 10th century. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Edburgberie&quot;, meaning &quot;Eadburg&#x27;s town&quot;.

==History==
Adderbury is an ancient village, with reference to Athelstan granting land here to the Bishop of Winchester in 1014. 

Adderbury is noted for the many honey-coloured limestone cottages and houses in the older parts of the village. East Adderbury&#x27;s manor house is 16th-century and features diamond-patterned brick chimney-stacks. The Grange, also in East Adderbury, was built by John Bloxham of Banbury for Sir Thomas Cobb, first Baronet of Banbury, in 1684.

Near St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church is a tithe barn that was built for New College, Oxford. In the 1970s Jennifer Sherwood dated it mainly to the 14th century but English Heritage dates the earliest parts of the building to 1422. The walls are of ashlar marlstone and the roof is of Stonesfield slate. In the 17th century the barn was reduced to its present length of five bays and partly rebuilt. In about 1877 it was altered for Lawrence Palk, 1st Baron Haldon. The barn has similarities with tithe barns at Swalcliffe and Upper Heyford, both of which were also built for New College early in the 15th century. Because of its post-Medieval alterations it is only a Grade II listed building.

Major Larnach of Adderbury House&#x27;s horse Jeddah won the Epsom Derby at odds of 100–1 and also won at Ascot. The Major paid for the building of the Village Institute which opened in 1898 and has been the setting of countless village events, ranging from early instruction and sewing meetings to the present-day activities.

==Places of worship==
;Church of England

The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin is in East Adderbury. It is a Grade I listed building, is one of the largest parish churches in Oxfordshire and architecturally is one of the most important. It is nicknamed the Cathedral of the Feldon. St Mary&#x27;s building retains evidence of its 13th-century origins but was enlarged in the 14th century and again in the Perpendicular style in the early 15th century. By 1611, St Mary&#x27;s had a clock, for which there are records of repairs in 1617, 1621, 1626 and 1631. In 1684 it was replaced with a new clock, which with periodic repairs served the parish until late in the 19th century. It has since been replaced with a new clock built by John Smith and Sons of Derby, and little has been preserved of the 1684 clock except one shaft from the motion and the remains of one hand. In the 18th century, St Mary&#x27;s fell into disrepair.

In the 19th century restoration was carried out in phases: sensitively by the architect J.C. Buckler between 1831 and 1834 and by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1866 and 1870, and less sensitively by Sir George&#x27;s son John Oldrid Scott in 1886. St Mary&#x27;s had a ring of six bells until 1789, when John Briant of Hertford took them down and re-cast them into a ring of eight. The third bell was recast again in 1863, this time by George Mears and Company of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The sixth bell was recast again in 1927, this time by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough. St Mary&#x27;s also has a Sanctus bell that was cast by Matthew I Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire in 1681. The spire reaches a height of .

;Methodist
The Methodist Church in High Street was built in 1893. It is a member of the Banbury Methodist Circuit.

;Roman Catholic
The Roman Catholic Saint George&#x27;s chapel in Round Close Road in West Adderbury was built in 1956.

===No longer in religious use===
;Society of Friends

The former West Adderbury Friends meeting house was built in 1675 for Bray Doyley. This was before the Act of Toleration 1689 legalised Quaker worship in England, so Doyley was sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment for having had it built. Quaker meetings ceased in the early 20th century and the meeting house was leased to the Parish Council, who maintain the building but had the adjoining women&#x27;s meeting house demolished in about 1955. Today, the Meeting House is used for up to four special Friends&#x27; meetings per year, as allowed by the Parish Council&#x27;s lease. The meeting house is also used as a waiting room for the Parish Council&#x27;s adjoining cemetery. The meeting house retains 18th century benches, elders&#x27; stand and gallery, and is a Grade II* listed building. Next to it are the walls of the Quaker burial ground, which are also probably 17th-century.

;Independent (former)

A former Independent chapel, self-governing and owing no allegiance to outside denominations was built in 1829 in Cross Hill Road in West Adderbury. It was registered as a place of worship for marriage in 1854-60. An adjoining manse was demolished in 1870 and was replaced with a school. The chapel closed in 1955 and was sold in 1957. The main door was widened when the chapel was converted to industrial use.

==Adderbury House==
Adderbury House is a country house in East Adderbury built in the 17th century. It was owned by Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester, who fought on the Royalist side during the English Civil War. Wilmot was a cavalry commander with Prince Rupert of the Rhine, and both men kept troops at Adderbury House. The poet Anne Wharton, wife of the Whig politician Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton, died there in 1685. Adderbury House has been remodelled several times: in 1661 for Anne Wilmot, Countess of Rochester, in 1722 for John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, in 1731 by the architect Roger Morris and in 1768 by the architect Sir William Chambers for Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. In 1739, John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, hosted fellow poet Alexander Pope, who composed a poem on his visit.

In the early 1760s, Lancelot &#x27;Capability&#x27; Brown was asked to create a plan for the park and gardens at Adderbury for Jane, Duchess of Argyll. It is more likely that improvements to the landscape were overseen at a later date by Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch after he inherited the estate from her in 1767. Brown&#x27;s account book shows a charge of £42 for a journey to Adderbury and the preparation of plan &#x27;for alteration of the Park &amp; Gardens&#x27;. It is unclear how much, if any, of Brown&#x27;s plans were implemented but when the estate was sold in 1774, the grounds consisted of 224 acres of flower gardens, parkland enclosed by belts of evergreens and forest trees and “a fine serpentine stream of water in full view of the house” which was very much in his style.

In the mid-1850s, the owner William Hunt Chamberlin altered the lake area and turned it into pleasure grounds with ornamental buildings and planting. Most of the house was demolished in 1808.

==Clockmakers==
Adderbury&#x27;s Quaker community included a number of clockmakers. Richard Gilkes (1715–87) was a son of Thomas Gilkes of Sibford Gower. Richard was apprenticed to his father and started his own business in Adderbury East in about 1736. Gilkes was a prolific clockmaker until the 1770s and maintained the turret clock of St Mary the Virgin parish church from 1747 until 1786. Joseph Williams (1762–1835) lived in Adderbury East and traded from 1788. Williams made longcase clocks and succeeded Richard Gilkes in the maintenance of the parish church clock, which he did from 1788 until 1827. His son William Williams (1793–1862) assisted him and took over the business on his father&#x27;s death in 1835. He made longcase clocks and maintained the parish church clock from 1828 until 1839.

==Morris dancing==
The existence of the traditional Adderbury Morris dancing side was first documented by Janet Blunt. In 1916 she began interviewing William &quot;Binx&quot; Walton, who was then 80 years old. Walton had been foreman of the Adderbury side for 20 years in the mid-19th century. In 1919 Blunt introduced Walton to Cecil Sharp, who watched Walton&#x27;s performances and published detailed descriptions in his Morris Book. Subsequent researches have determined that there were once as many as three Morris sides in the village, and the names of more than two dozen of the 19th century dancers have been documented. During Whitsun week they performed in Adderbury and neighbouring villages. Sides regularly used to dance at Banbury Fair and the well-known Banbury eccentric, William &#x27;Old Mettle&#x27; Castle, was fool for the Adderbury team in the 19th century. During this period the village had two or possibly three sides performing although this had died out by the 1880s.

A revival side was established at the village school in the Edwardian era and some of the boys developed into a men&#x27;s Morris side, prior to the First World War. There are pictures of this side and the names of the members were established, through talking to older village residents, in 1974. One of the dancers in the photographs, Charlie Coleman, was still alive at that time. Of those in the pictures, only Coleman returned from the war and that revival of Morris dancing in Adderbury therefore died with them. However, the dances had been recorded from two of the last surviving members of the 19th century team, brothers William and John Walton, in such detail by Janet Blunt and others that they could still be performed by a newly formed revival team led by Bryan Sheppard and Tim Radford.

The side split in 1975 to form two Morris dancing sides in Adderbury, the Adderbury Village Morris Men (dressed in white and green with top hats) – whose members come from the village or surrounding parishes and only dance traditional dances from Adderbury – and the Adderbury Morris Men (dressed in white, blue and red), who take dancers from anywhere and who occasionally create new dances to add to the repertoire. There is also now a women&#x27;s side, named &quot;Sharp and Blunt&quot; after Cecil Sharp and Janet Blunt. The Adderbury tradition has become popular with groups of dancers from as far afield as the United States, Australia and India. Once a year both teams come together, with other guest sides, for a &quot;Day of Dance&quot; throughout the village.

==Amenities==
There is a village shop and library in the High Street. The parish room and library were given in 1893 by J. F. Stankey of Bodicote House. Banbury business park is a modest cluster of office and distribution buildings on Aynho Road in the east of the parish. Adderbury has a Church of England primary school: Christopher Rawlins School. Adderbury has four public houses:
* Bell Inn in the High Street (Hook Norton Brewery).
* Coach and Horses by the Green (Wadworth Brewery).
* Pickled Ploughman formerly the Plough Inn, a free house in Aynho Road.
* Red Lion by the Green (Greene King Brewery).

Adderbury village activities include tennis and squash, The Women&#x27;s Institute, photography, cinema, cycling, conservation, and history association, Adderbury bowls, football and cricket clubs, Adderbury Rainbows and 1st Adderbury Scouts, Mothers&#x27; Union, Over Sixties&#x27; Club, Gardening Club, and amateur dramatics (Adderbury Theatre Workshop). In 1977 a talent contest was held as part of Adderbury&#x27;s celebrations of Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. It was such a success that Adderbury Theatre Workshop was formed. Every year since then, the Village Institute has hosted several dramatic and musical performances including pantomimes, cabarets and plays. In 1984 members from Adderbury Theatre Workshop appeared at the Cropredy Festival where they performed the &quot;Pheasant Pluckers Song&quot;.

==Games and sports==
Adderbury has a bowls club and a tennis and squash club. Adderbury Park Football Club competes in the Hellenic Football League. Banbury Golf Club is in the east of the parish on the B4100. It was opened in 1993 and its course consists of 18 holes. The current clubhouse, adapted from stone former dairy buildings, is in the centre of the course. The greens are built to USGA specification. Par is 70 and SSS 69. From the white tees the courses extends and from the yellow tees up to . The Ladies&#x27; yardage is with Par 70 SSS 70.

==Transport==
Adderbury is on the Stagecoach in Oxfordshire Gold route S4 between Oxford and Banbury. On weekdays and Saturdays buses run hourly to Kidlington and Oxford, and twice an hour to Deddington and Banbury. On Sundays there are four buses a day in each direction. Railways briefly pass through the easternmost river meander, the combined Chiltern Main and Cherwell Valley Lines, to the north of which Kings Sutton railway station is connected to the easternmost of three watercourse bridges at Old Twyford by a direct footpath. The M40 motorway passes through the north-east of the parish a few miles south of reaching junction 11 adjoining Banbury&#x27;s town centre.

===Dismantled Banbury and Cheltenham Direct railway===
The former Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway, part of the Great Western Railway, was completed in 1881. Adderbury railway station was at East Adderbury. British Railways closed the station in 1951 and closed the railway to freight in 1964.

<doc id="1148804" wikidata="Q1025136" url="?curid=1148804" title="Hov, Faroe Islands">
<text>Hov is a village located on Suduroy&#x27;s east coast, in the Faroe Islands; it is frequently mentioned in the country&#x27;s history.

Salmon sea farming has been practiced in Hov since the 1980s. North of Hov along the old road to Øravík are interesting basalt columns that march along the hills.

== The Church ==
The wooden church in Hov was originally built in Vágur on Kirkjukletti in 1862. It was moved to Hov in 1942. A new church was built in Vágur, it was ready in 1939, after that they could start to take down the old church and move it to Hov, as it was promised 25 years earlier in 1914.

== Hovstunnilin - The Hov-Øravík tunnel ==
In 2007, the road tunnel &quot;Hovstunnilin&quot; opened. In addition to connecting the villages of Hov and Øravík, it connects the southern and the northern parts of the island. It is no longer necessary to drive over the mountain, which can be difficult in wintertime. Now, it takes only 20 minutes to drive from Tvøroyri to Vágur. The tunnel is 2.5 km (or 1.55 mi) long.

== Viking History - Viking Chief Havgrímur ==

According to the Faroese Sagas and local tradition, the first Viking settler on Suðuroy established a farm in Hov, which is said to be named after his pagan &quot;hof&quot;. His grave is at &quot;undir Homrum&quot; in Hov and is the only chieftain burial site to be found on the Faroes. Hov lies in the middle of the island and the area is flat and wide with a good view out to sea. This enabled Suðuroy&#x27;s first settlers to follow exactly what was happening on the sea around.
The viking Havgrímur who was chief of half of the country lived in Hov in the 10th century. His burial plot is located in the hills above the village, but was largely destroyed when opened in by amateur archaeologists in 1834.

== The area west of Hov ==
West of Hov is a waterfall with the name Foldarafossur. It lies in Hovsá, which runs from Vatnsnes and is the line of demarcation between the villages of Porkeri and Hov. The waterfall is formed at the place where Hovsá runs over the edge at Foldarshamri, and a bit further to the south there is a mountain pass which is called Foldarsskarð. These three place names all have the same origin, and linguists think that the name comes from the soil (in Faroese also foldin) below these localities. 

Approx. 30 years ago, the electricity company SEV commenced construction work in Hovsdal, so that the hydropower could be converted into electricity, and a dam was built approx. ½ km west of Foldarafoss. Therefore, the waterfall does not have the same power as before, but if it rains a lot, and water flows out over the dam, the waterfall may show some of its old power.

== Myri Museum - The Old Shop ==
There is an old building down in the harbour of Hov, which now is a museum, an art gallery and a café. The eastern part of the house is called Fiskastovan. The western part of the house has been a shop until sometime in 1980s. Other parts of the house and the area around it has been used for clip fish industry, the fish was dried outside the house on the flat stones. A white flag was raised in order to let people in the village know when there was work for them. That was before the phone was a possibility. The house was in bad shape a few years ago, but now it has been restored. Some interesting items and old books with peoples names and how much they earned etc. are still in the house. The house was first located in Vágur, but it was moved to Hov, just like the church was. Fiskastovan á Mýri is used for many different purposes: Art exhibitions, café, small concerts, lectures, dinner for groups etc.

<doc id="1148809" wikidata="Q3695595" url="?curid=1148809" title="Think City">
<text>The Think City (stylized as the TH!NK City) is an electric city car that was produced by Norwegian carmaker Think Global, and production partner Valmet Automotive from 2008 to 2012. It is a small two-seater/2+2-seater highway capable vehicle, with a top speed of , and an all-electric range of on a full charge.

As of early 2011, the Th!nk was one of only five crash-tested, mass-produced, and highway-certified electric cars in the world, together with the Tesla Roadster (2008), the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, the Nissan Leaf and the Smart ED. The Th!nk City was sold in Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, the United Kingdom and the United States. , a total of 2,500 units had been manufactured at Oslo-based TH!NK&#x27;s production facility. Norway was the leading market with 1,120 units registered through September 2013.

Due to financial difficulties, production of the Th!nk City in Finland was stopped in March 2011, and the company filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years. Think Global was purchased soon after by Electric Mobility Solutions AS, which announced production to resume in early 2012 with a refined Think City. However, production never resumed, and the Indiana plant completed its final car in August 2012.

==History==
The vehicle was known as the Pivco PIV4 in its prototype phase. Ford bought the Norwegian company in 1999 in anticipation of the incoming California Air Resources Board zero emissions vehicle mandate. After the laws partially wound back and made less stringent, Ford ceased production of the vehicle in 2002 with 1,005 units produced. Ford sold the Norwegian electric car company the following year.

The Th!nk City was exhibited for the first time in the UK in July 2008. At the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, Think announced that the Th!nk City would be launched in Denmark and Sweden in 2008, followed by launching in the UK, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands in 2009.

At the 2008 British International Motor Show at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre, London, THINK announced that the Th!nk City will be available to UK customers from the summer of 2009. Prime Minister Gordon Brown joined Transport Minister Geoff Hoon for a presentation by managing director of Think UK.

==First generation (2000)==
The original Think City was produced by the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Norwegian subsidiary TH!NK from 2000 until 2002. It was leased in limited numbers in Europe and the United States.

More than 370 vehicles were delivered to customers in North America. They were largely leased to individuals and companies as part of station car trials in California and New York. NHTSA regulations stipulated that these vehicles could not legally remain in the United States beyond the three-year time frame for these trials. Around half of the North American units were scrapped while the other half were exported back to Norway as used cars.

==Second generation (2008)==
===Production===
Think Global originally planned to start deliveries to Norwegian customers in the last quarter of 2007. That target was missed, but as of August 2008 some 100 electric cars had been manufactured for customers in Norway.
On December 15, 2008, the carmaker suspended all vehicle production and laid off 50% of its staff pending negotiation of up to million in funding for working capital, citing &quot;urgent financial distress.&quot; Production of the Th!nk City restarted on December 10, 2009, at Valmet Automotive in Uusikaupunki, Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;valmet-automotive.com/automotive&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 production had reached 2,500 units, making the Th!nk City one of the world&#x27;s best selling pure electric cars.

On November 24, 2010, Think North America began manufacturing in the Magnum Drive plant located in Elkhart, Indiana. Initially the Finland plant manufactures the body and wheels on the chassis, then ships them to the United States. The lithium-ion battery, made by EnerDel in Indianapolis, the motor and gearbox, seats, headlights and other components are assembled in the Elkhart plant. Each car takes about a week to complete.

Due to financial difficulties, production of the Th!nk City in Finland was stopped in March 2011, and the company filed for bankruptcy in Norway on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years. Although Think North America is a separate entity, its future also is in doubt because it is financially supported by the headquarters in Norway. Production in the Elkhart plant was halted a few days before the bankruptcy filing due to delays in the delivery of parts required to assemble the electric cars.

Think Global&#x27;s assets were bought by Electric Mobility Solutions AS in July 2011, including shares of wholly owned subsidiaries THINK North America and THINK UK. The new owners announced that production is scheduled to restart in early 2012 with a refined Think City.

===Specifications===

===Sales and price===

;Finland
The list price for the car in Finland was .

;France
During 2010 a total of 11 units were registered in France. A total of 110 units were sold in 2011.

====United States====
The Th!nk City retail price was before any applicable federal and local incentives. However, due to the higher cost of low production, Think USA announced that the price of the first 100 units was before any incentives. The first 100 Th!nks were delivered in late 2010 mostly to fleet customers in Indiana. Sales to the general public were expected to begin by mid-2011. Think North America issued three recalls on the first cars produced at the Elkhart plant for defects to its gear shift levers, seat belts and defrosting systems.

The company expected to sell 2,000 to 3,000 cars in 2011 via three to five branded stores in five markets: Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Washington, D.C. and Indianapolis, and planned to market the electric car as an urban city car.

Following the bankruptcy of Think Global, the remaining 150 Th!nk cars in stock in the U.S. were put on nationwide sale at a discounted price of before any federal and local incentives.

<text>Hoyvík (Danish: &quot;Højvig&quot;) is a town in the Faroe Islands. It is part of the Tórshavn Municipality, and de facto is merged as a northern suburb of Tórshavn, the Faroese capital.

== History ==

Hoyvík is believed to be a very old settlement. An early source is the &quot;Færeyinga saga&quot;, a 13th-century recollection of earlier Viking oral recounts. 

Before the late 20th century the population was very low. Until the mid 19th century the entire population comprised one farm. A few more houses were built close to the farmland after the Second World War. A real development boom has been in Hoyvík since about the early 1980s. The new houses have been built on land that was formerly considered farmer outfields. The architecture of some of these newer houses include detached and terraced housing. 
== Notable facts ==
A 17th-century farmhouse functions today as an open-air museum, part of the National Museum of the Faroe Islands.
Important institutions in Hoyvík are the gymnasium and the Faroese Historical Museum. The first church in Hoyvík was finished in 2007.
In 2005 a free trade agreement between the Faroe Islands and Iceland was signed in Hoyvík at the Historical Museum. It is consequently known as the Hoyvík Agreement.

<doc id="1148843" wikidata="Q666627" url="?curid=1148843" title="Hvalba">
<text>Hvalba () is a village and a municipality in the Faroe Islands, which consists of Hvalba, Nes-Hvalba and Sandvík.

The village spreads around the bottom of a deep inlet, Hvalbiarfjørður, in the northeast of Suðuroy.

==Population==
Hvalba is one of the larger villages in the Faroe Islands. The total population of Hvalba Municipality (&quot;Hvalbiar Kommuna&quot;) was 674 as of March 2022; the population of Hvalba and Nes was 607 and the population of Sandvík was 67. The small village Nes is often called Nes-Hvalba, because there are two other villages with the same name. Nes is located on the southern arm of the fjord Hvalbiarfjørður, opposite of Hvalba. Nes does not have its own postal code. Hvalba has one supermarket, a fast food shop and a few more shops. Some of the villagers work as coalminers; Hvalba is the only place in the Faroes which still has active coal mine industry, although in very small scale. There are two harbours and some fish factories in Hvalba, both harbours are on the northern side of the bay. There is a boat harbour in Nes and a small harbour in Sandvík. The municipality plans to make a new marina between the two harbours on a place which is called &quot;Á Hamranesi&quot;. Some trawlers belong to the village, they deliver fish for the fish factory. Some people work in other villages i.e. at the Suduroy Hospital in Tvøroyri or at the Faroe Islands Ferry and Buss Transportation Company including the ferry Smyril, which sails between Suðuroy and Tórshavn, but there are also a few independent small companies in Hvalba, i.e. IT supporters, carpenters, transport company, dietitian, internet shop etc. Hvalba is located on the east side of the island but the inlet is so deep that the distance to the west coast is quite short, so the island almost splits into two islands. There are two isthmuses in Hvalba: Hvalbiareiði (also called Fiskieiði) and Norðbergseiði (also called Á Drátti). There is a memorial in Hvalba, it is located on the northern side of the fjord, just before one comes to the first harbour, not far from the bottom of the bay. The memorial is made of stone, the stonework was made by Lars and Helmut Larsen from Tórshavn, it was raised in 1963 in memory of people from Hvalba who lost their lives at sea or by other accidents, i.e. by accidents in the coal mines or by falling down from the island Lítla Dímun or from one of the mountains which surround the village.

== Connected by tunnels ==
Two tunnels connect Hvalba to its neighbouring villages. The southbound Hvalbiartunnilin (1450 m) leads to Trongisvágur and Tvøroyri. The northbound Sandvíkartunnilin (1500 m) leads to Sandvík. Construction of a new tunnel to Trongisvágur started in 2019, and was opened to traffic in 2021, whereupon the old tunnel was closed.

== Hvalbiareiði and Norðbergseiði ==
On the west coast there is a place of call that makes it possible to go fishing in small boats from both sides of the island. The place has two names; it is called Hvalbiareiði or Fiskieiði. The name Hvalbiareiði refers to the name of the village Hvalba, Fiskieiði refers to the fact that this place used to be a fish harbour. There are still a few boat houses there, but most of them are ruins. Most of the men of Hvalba are members of the crews of one of the trawlers of the village. Many people from Hvalba own their share of these trawlers. There is another &quot;Eiði&quot; in Hvalba, it is called Norðbergseiði, named after a mountain nearby, which is called Norðberg. Norðbergseiði is the northern one of the two &quot;eidi&quot;. Norðbergseiði and Hvalbiareiði are separated by the mountain Grímsfjall (the Mountain of Grímur).

== Tourism ==
Tourism has been developing over the past few years. Some people from Hvalba started to arrange boat trips to the uninhabited island Lítla Dímun in 2009, and the same year some men from Hvalba started to offer &quot;síging&quot;, which is a kind of rappelling (abseiling) for tourists on Norðbergseiði. There have also been arranged BBQ evenings with blues music on Fiskieiði combined with boat trips along the cliffs of Hvalba and rappelling. The coal mines are also a tourist attraction. There are high mountains around Hvalba, some tourists enjoy going for hiking trips from Nes-Hvalba via the gorge Káragjógv to Trongisvágur. There are cairns, which people can follow. Before the tunnel came in 1963 the path along the cairns was the only way to get from Hvalba to Trongisvágur and the part of the island which is south of Hvalba. There are now public toilets in Hvalba and in Sandvík.

== Coal Mines ==
In the mountains around the southbound tunnel brown coal has been extracted from mines since the 1770s. The coal was an important source of energy on the Faroe Islands until the end of World War II. A few miners are still extracting coal from the mines. Today there is only one active coal mine left. They closed down one of the older mines early in 2010 and started to excavate a new one in 2010.

== Pirates and &quot;Turkargravir&quot; ==
Pirates ravaged Hvalba, as other villages on Suðuroy, in the 17th century. In 1629 three North-African pirate ships attacked the village. When they left the village after the ravage two of the ships ran aground on some rocks and were shattered by the surf. Tradition says that more than 300 bodies washed ashore. By the shore, there is a place called ‘Turkargravir’. Here all the bodies were buried. 30 women and children were taken away to be sold as slaves in North Africa. On the Faroe Islands, a collection was organized to raise enough money to buy back the people. This was not successful and the people never returned to the islands.

==Sports==
The local football team is Royn Hvalba (Bóltfelagið Royn).

<doc id="1148846" wikidata="Q4981157" url="?curid=1148846" title="Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words">
<text>Bryson&#x27;s Dictionary of Troublesome Words () is a book by Bill Bryson, published under several titles since 1984, that catalogues some of the English language&#x27;s most commonly misused words and phrases in order to demonstrate preferable usage. It helps writers and editors to think about how to make written communication clearer.

== Publication history ==

It was first published in 1984 with the title &quot;The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words&quot; () in the United Kingdom and with the title &quot;The Facts on File Dictionary of Troublesome Words&quot; () in the United States. It was republished in a revised edition in 1987; and again in the UK in 1997 under the title &quot;Troublesome Words&quot; (). In 2002 it was published as &quot;Bryson&#x27;s Dictionary of Troublesome Words&quot;.

== Content ==
Using almost forty standard works on the subject as his guide, Bryson aimed to produce a list of difficult English words that is generally readable and informative while also usable as a reference work.

Like all other major usage advice books, it reflects the language epistemology of professional editors, which is not completely coincident with that of linguistic scientists. It makes use of both linguistic prescription and linguistic description, attempting to avoid the pathological extremes of prescription (valueless pedantry such as hypercorrection) while also making use of its helpful side (which encourages critical thinking).

As the author states, &quot;This book might more accurately, if less convincingly, have been called &quot;A Guide to Everything in English Usage That the Author Wasn&#x27;t Entirely Clear About Until Quite Recently.&quot;&quot; Bryson describes the English language as a valuable entity, with no two experts agreeing on any point of usage, claiming that those guides that do exist for the common user often expect the reader to be familiar with grammatical terms not encountered since (or even at) high school.

<doc id="1148848" wikidata="Q1994733" url="?curid=1148848" title="Natal astrology">
<text>Natal astrology, also known as genethliac astrology or genethlialogy, is a system of astrology that claims to shed light on an individual’s personality or path in life based on constructing a horoscope or natal chart that includes the exact date, time, and location of an individual&#x27;s birth. Natal astrology is found in the Indian, Chinese, Hellenistic and Western astrological traditions.

A horoscope illustrates the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Immum Coeli as well as the aspects or angles between them. Interpretation includes noting the placement and significance of important features. &quot;Chart Weighting&quot; analyzes Zodiac Signs and Houses. &quot;Chart Shaping&quot; analyzes planetary aspect patterns.

In general, astrology is considered to be a pseudoscience by the scientific community. There is little statistical evidence that shows causation between horoscopes and the consequences in a person&#x27;s life or those that may occur throughout the world.

==Features==
Within a horoscope, important features of significance may include the planets, aspects, Signs and Houses of the Sun, Moon and Ascendant.

The Ascendant has a very strong influence. It is also known as the Rising Sign or Chart Ruler. This may also include one of the first three houses that follow an Ascendant. If no planet occupies the first three houses, a planet in the twelfth house, that is closest to the Ascendant, may be acknowledged as the Rising Sign.

Planetary aspects that are in Conjunction or adjacent to the primary angles of the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Immum Coeli may also be important features.

==Chart weighting==
Chart weighting analyzes significant categories. This may include the Signs and Houses of the Sun, Moon, planets, Ascendant, and Midheaven. For example, if multiple planets are in Fire Signs, the attributes of those signs give more importance or &#x27;weight&#x27; to a person&#x27;s personality.

===Weighting by sign===
Chart weighting by sign analyzes masculine or feminine signs as well as elements and their qualities. Elements include fire, earth, air or water. Qualities include cardinal, fixed or mutable.

Some astrologers may only use ten or eleven planets. Others may only include the Ascendant and Midheaven. The modern planets of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto may be excluded, because they influence generations; their positions may not have significance in a person&#x27;s individual chart.

*Masculine Signs are Fire and Air Signs. They include Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may be extroverted, confident or assertive. They solve problems with enterprise and courage.
*Feminine Signs are Earth and Water Signs. They include Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may be introverted, shy or passive. Intuitively, they conserve, nurture and solve problems.
*Fire Signs include Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may be energetic, enthusiastic or optimistic. They may be in the center of the action making things happen. They are egotistical, headstrong or arrogant, but also generous, warm-hearted or spontaneously kind. They are independent and prefer to control their own lives, but may also be autocratic. If a person lacks Fire Signs, they may be shy, fearful, overly cautious or pessimistic, which may lead to a lack enthusiasm, confidence or faith in the future. To compensate for this lack, Cardinal planets in the 1st, 5th or 9th houses may be helpful. 
*Earth Signs include Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may be capable, practical, sensible, shrewd or cautious. They prefer concrete things rather than abstract ideas. They carry out their work in a slow, thorough manner. They are careful not to waste time or money. They may be shy and slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when they do. They are generous to those they love, but may tend towards meanness. They need emotional and material security, but will put up with quite a lot to get it. If a person lacks Earth Signs, they may lack common sense and practicality. They may find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be unreliable, clumsy, scatty, unrealistic, or hopeless with money. To compensate, planets in the 2nd, 6th or 10th houses in Fixed Signs may be helpful.
*Air Signs include Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may be an excellent communcicator of a variety of ideas and theories. They are imaginative, quick-witted, and are able to do a number of things at once. They are interested in the latest technologies and look for answers to life&#x27;s questions. They make good teachers and writers. They have many friends and acquaintances, but may not be interested in family life. They are more tense than they appear and live on their nerves. They may also be sarcastic and rude. If a person lacks Air Signs, they may have difficulty assimilating or explaining new ideas. They may be boring and find it difficult to communicate, because they lack imagination or a sense of humor. They may be too practical. To compensate, planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses in Mutable Signs may be helpful.
*Water Signs include Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may be difficult to live with, because they may have difficulty expressing their feelings. They need time to grasp a new concept and may respond slowly. They are very emotional and passionate. They are kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection. They direct their affection towards family, close friends and animals. If a person lacks Water Signs, they may not be intuitive to the needs of others. They may be too full of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of others. To compensate, planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses may be helpful. 
*Cardinal Signs include Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may take charge of their own world and may not want to be held under anybody&#x27;s rule. It is difficult to influence or deflect their energy, because they are motivated, courageous and believe they know best. If a person lacks Cardinal Signs, they may feel that they are never in control of their own lives. They may be manipulated by people or circumstances beyond their control. They may prefer others to make decisions for them, because they lack initiative or courage. To compensate, planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th houses in a Fire or Air Sign may be helpful.
*Fixed Signs include Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may have strength and endurance to see things through. They prefer the known rather than uncertainty. They need stable homes, careers and partnerships. They are loyal and dependable, but can be very obstinate. If a person lacks Fixed Signs, they may not be able see things through. They may walk away from problems. They may be too easily bored or too busy chasing rainbows to ever accomplish anything. To compensate, planets in the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses in an Earth Sign may be helpful.
*Mutable Signs include Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. If these signs dominate a Natal Chart, a person may devote their lives to helping others, because they are friendly, cooperative and adaptable. They can fit into almost any situation, put up with anything and turn any situation to their advantage. They can steer projects through periods of transition and bring them to a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, they seem to have more than their fair share of problems. They may also be selfish and ruthless. If a person lacks Mutable Signs, their views may be rigid and difficult to change. They may lack flexibility and have difficulty adapting to change. They may be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need much notice before they commit to anything. To compensate, planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses in Water Signs may be helpful.

===Chart Signature===
A Chart Signature summarizes the process of weighting with a single Zodiac Sign. This involves noting which element and quality has the most signs and then combining them into a single Zodiac Sign, which is acknowledged as the Signature Sign of the chart. In a Natal Chart, a Signature Sign may have more influence than any other sign.

For example, if a chart has more Fire Signs than any other element and more Fixed Signs than any other quality, then Leo is acknowledged as the Signature Sign of that chart, because it is a Fixed Fire Sign.

If there are no majorities in element or quality, the sign of the ruling planets of the Sun or Ascendant may be added. For example, if the Sun is in Taurus, the sign of its ruling planet of Venus is added to its appropriate element and quality. If Venus is also in Pisces, the sign that occupies Pisces is also added in the same way.

===Weighting by House===
*Angular Houses include the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th Houses. Planets in these Houses exert a strong influence. They may compensate for a lack of strength, courage, enthusiasm, and Cardinal Signs in a chart.
*Succedent Houses include the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th Houses. Planets in these Houses involve creativity and possessions, which may include others. They may compensate for a lack of Fixed Signs in a chart.
*Cadent Houses include the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th Houses. Planets in these Houses develop aptitude and unique talent. They may compensate for a lack of adaptability and Mutable Signs in a chart.

==Chart shaping==
Chart shaping involves examining the placement of the planets in the chart by the aspects they form and by their positioning in the chart relative to one another. Any significant patterns or &#x27;shapes&#x27; which occur in the chart are then interpreted for their importance to the personality of the native.

===Aspect patterns===
While the astrologer must note every aspect formed by the planets, aspects can be grouped together into larger patterns which must be given particular attention in the chart. The main aspect patterns are as follows:

*Stellium: At least three planets linked together in a series of continuous conjunctions. The planets will act as if they are all in conjunction with each other, even if not all of them actually are. This pattern gives a huge emphasis to the sign occupied by the planets, regardless of the sun sign.
*Grand trine: Three trine aspects together. Indicative of a person at ease with him or herself, with strong inner harmony, talents and abilities. However it may make a person unable to cope with any real adversity, and may produce a weak, apathetic and condescending character.
*Grand cross: Two pairs of opposing planets squared to each other. Often proves to be a &quot;make or break&quot; pattern; either the person develops unusual strength of character, or feels crushed by life. Person will have &quot;a cross to bear&quot;.
*T-Square: Two planets in opposition squared to a third. The tension typical of the opposition aspect is aggravated by additional problems introduced by the third planet. Often an obstructive feature blocking the normal flow of behaviour of the person. Person needs to develop activities represented by the &quot;missing&quot; arm of the T-square to achieve wholeness.
*Yod: Two quincunxes together joined by a sextile. It indicates restlessness and instability. The person gets drawn into the lives of others in ways that are difficult to avoid, with periodic crises and urgent calls for assistance.

===Hemispheres===
The houses are grouped into four main categories or hemispheres. Horoscopes appear &#x27;upside down&#x27; in relation to how the compass points usually appear, with the ascendant marking the eastern horizon traditionally appearing on the left hand side. For this reason the southern hemisphere appears in the upper part of the horoscope.
*Upper (southern) hemisphere The 7th, 8th, 9th 10th, 11th and 12th houses. A subject with most of his or her planets in this hemisphere will not be too deeply affected by the actions of other people. He or she will be able to distance themselves from those around them and from public events and movements, focusing firmly on their own needs and feelings, or the general cause of humanity that is important to them. If the planets are grouped in the 8th, 9th or 12th houses, the subject will have strong spiritual needs and values. Planets grouped in the 10th house will make the subject ambitious and politically astute; while if they are in the 11th house he or she will be interested in humanitarian causes and education.
*Lower (northern) hemisphere The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th houses. A subject with most of his or her planets in this part of the chart will be sensitive to the moods and feelings of others, and may suffer a good deal as a result. The person may try to live through their family rather than for themselves, and may be too subjective in their thinking. They may also choose to do most of their thinking and working at home.
*Eastern hemisphere The 10th, 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd houses. A subject who has most of his or her planets in this hemisphere will be a self-starter who chooses their own path through life and sets their own boundaries. They are not happy being a burden to other people, or being kept by someone else. They also have the burden themselves of being an initiator at work and in their personal life, as little is likely to be done for them by others. When the planets are in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd houses, the subject is likely to be very self-absorbed and convinced that his or her own opinions are the only ones that matter.
*Western hemisphere The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th houses. A subject with most of these planets in this hemisphere will need to be very diplomatic in order to keep those around him on their side. They may be looked after in some way by others, or else spend their lives supporting and motivating others. When the majority of planets are in the 6th, 7th and 8th houses he or she will use their energy to fulfil the needs to others. The subject may bring about a situation of being needed by bringing a number of children into the world to love and care for.

===Jones patterns===
The American astrologer Marc Edmund Jones has listed seven significant patterns which also occur in the chart, based on the positions of the planets relative to one another.

*Bundle : In this pattern the planets are grouped together so that they form a &#x27;bundle&#x27; within the space of 120 degrees, or the equivalent of four signs of the zodiac. This intense concentration of planets produces a person who is equally intense and unrelenting in pursuit of personal interests. Perspective and understanding of others is limited, and it is difficult for this person to share their lives with anyone. The best course of life for such a person is to enter into enterprises that require deep concentration, persistence and commitment, or to specialise in one area of expertise.
*Bowl : In this pattern the planets are grouped into a &#x27;bowl&#x27; of one hemisphere of 180 degrees, or the equivalent of six zodiac signs. The pattern will have particular force if all the planets are contained within one hemisphere. A person with this pattern will be self-contained, and go in search of enterprises that are meaningful, fulfilling and personally relevant. They tend to have a ministerial quality that seeks the right kind of career or vocation that will produce the greatest benefit for themselves and others.
*Bucket : This pattern is similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the opposite hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a &#x27;bucket&#x27; form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this often means is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according to the nature of the Singleton planet that forms the handle of the pattern. This planet will exercise a greater influence than normal in the chart, and will be an important part of the dynamic of the person&#x27;s activities and basic energy.
*Seesaw : In this pattern the planets form two groups on opposite sides of the chart, the groups no less than sixty degrees or two signs apart. As its name suggests, this produces a person who behaves like a &#x27;seesaw&#x27;, with their life following a pattern of two distinctly contrasting alternatives. The person can find it difficult to integrate these two sharply different parts of their life, which are often in competition with each other. However, success produces the increased sophistication and polished, knowing demeanour of a person who is able to deal with most of life&#x27;s situations.
*Locomotive : This pattern is produced when all the planets are contained within 240 degrees or nine signs of the zodiac, so that a whole 120 degrees is completely unoccupied. The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence the life of the person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the &#x27;locomotive&#x27; of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal. Such a person will often be a loner, waiting for the public to discover the truth of what they have been saying all along.
*Splay : This type of natal chart is noteworthy because of the presence of at least two, but usually three pairs (or conjunctions) of planets randomly distributed in a &#x27;splay&#x27; shape around the chart. A person with this pattern will have enormous talent and potential that needs deliberate attention to be developed into worthwhile skills. The person will be an individualist, with no desire for a regimented or highly organized way of life, and they will seek to avoid becoming trapped in routine. However, there is often the difficulty that there is a lack of relevance between the different skill sets, so that the person may not derive the full benefit from them. Such a person needs to concentrate on &#x27;getting their act together&#x27;.
*Splash : As its name suggests this pattern, or rather lack of pattern, occurs when the planets are randomly distributed around the chart in a &#x27;splash&#x27;. A person with this pattern will have diversification as their number one asset, with a universal and enriching mental outlook on life. The person will be eager to share their life and resources as universally as possible, wherever the need is greatest. However, as with the splay pattern, there is a danger of the person scattering their energy unproductively.

== Scientific appraisal ==
===Carlson&#x27;s experiment===
Shawn Carlson&#x27;s double-blind chart matching tests, in which 28 astrologers agreed to match over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) test, is one of the most renowned tests of astrology. The experimental protocol used in Carlson&#x27;s study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment. Astrologers, nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, acted as the astrological advisors, and helped to ensure, and agreed, that the test was fair. They also chose 26 of the 28 astrologers for the tests, the other 2 being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards. The astrologers came from Europe and the United States. The astrologers helped to draw up the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested. Published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1985, the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing &quot;clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis&quot;.

===Dean and Kelly===
The scientist and former astrologer Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical, and other variables, but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies involving 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually 3 to 5 others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart. A further test involved 45 confident astrologers, with an average of 10 years of experience, and 160 test subjects (out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to extremes. The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals&#x27; ages, and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all.

===Mars effect===

The initial [[Mars effect]] finding, showing the relative frequency of the [[diurnal motion|diurnal position]] of Mars in the birth charts (N = 570) of &quot;eminent athletes&quot; (red solid line) compared to the expected results [after [[Michel Gauquelin]] 1955]

In 1955, astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in professions (such as doctors, scientists, athletes, actors, writers, painters, etc.) which astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin&#x27;s findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the &quot;Mars effect&quot;. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin&#x27;s part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the apparent effect may have been caused by inaccurate self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any intentional manipulation of the study results by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The sample group was taken from a time when belief in astrology was more common than today. Gauquelin failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, in which a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower in the initial study, further indicating that parents had reported dates and times to suit their beliefs.

==History==

===Grammar school===
The college officially began life as Upholland Grammar School, which was founded in 1661, initially opened on School Lane, Up Holland. The grammar school later moved to the Ox House Heyes Estate on Oxhouse Road in 1878, now the present-day site of Up Holland High School. The grammar school moved to its present site on &quot;Winstanley Road&quot; in Billinge Higher End in September 1953. It had 600 boys and girls in the 1960s and had 750 by 1976. During World War II the grammar school had its own Air Cadet Squadron – 1439 (Beacon) squadron with the headmaster Alfred Maggs BA MSc as the first commanding officer (Flt Lt A. Maggs RAFVR(T)).

===Sixth form college===

It was renamed Winstanley College in August 1977, and at that time, it ceased to enrol new pupils at age 11, gradually becoming a sixth form college. By September 1981, no pupils remained in the lower forms, and the transformation to a sixth-form college was complete. In 1995 the college was inspected by the Further Education Funding Council, where it was awarded Grades 1 and 2 in most categories, having been awarded a Grade 3 in accommodation. In 1999 the College was reinspected by the FEFC where the college received Grade 1s in most areas, except in the areas of General Resources, where it was awarded a Grade 2, and Governance, where it was awarded a Grade 3. Following the abolition of the Further Education Funding Council in 2000, the college was inspected by Ofsted for the first time in 2004 and it received an outstanding award, the highest award available from an Ofsted inspection, and following reinspection in 2007, the college would again receive an Outstanding award. In early 2009, plans were unveiled for an extensive redevelopment of the grounds, which was subsequently put to the Learning &amp; Skills Council for approval. In mid-2009 the project was shelved for lack of grant funding. Since that time the college has redeveloped the 1950s buildings by replacing its flat roofs, the music block was replaced with a £3m building for media and performing arts which was completed in 2012. A replacement library block and new accommodation for physical sciences and biology, along with a refurbishment of the maths building was completed in 2014. In March 2019, a new social sciences building was opened, home to sociology, psychology, health and social care. The college was reinspected in 2020, and it received a good award.

<text>Trongisvágur () is a village on the island of Suduroy in the Faroe Islands.

Trongisvágur is the village in the bottom of Trongisvágsfjørður (fjord) on the east coast of Suduroy. Trongisvágur and the neighbouring villages of Tvøroyri and Øravík have grown into one entity (the northern part of Øravík, which is called Øravíkarlíð, is where the ferry port Krambatangi is). A river called Stórá that runs through the valley passes through a plantation that is worth visiting on a good day, and then flows into the inlet at a nearby beach. There is a debate whether the name Trong is Norse or Gaelic in origin. Another version of the name is Trungisvágur. Trungisvágsbotnur is on the west coast, west of Trongisvágur. There are binoculars there in summertime, so people can have a closer look at birds and the vertical cliffs there. The place is called Á Røðini, but some people call it Kikarin, because of the binoculars. Shortly after the Park of Trongisvágur is the tunnel to Hvalba, the Hvalbiartunnilin, which was the first road tunnel in the Faroe Islands. It was dug in 1963 and is 1450 metres long. In 2019 the boring of a replacement tunnel commenced; the new tunnel was opened in 2021, whereupon the old one was closed. The highest mountain in Suðuroy, Gluggarnir, is in the south of Trongisvágur; it is 610 metres high.

== Sports Hall and Football Stadium ==
In Trongisvágur, there is a sports hall, a school and a kindergarten. On 17 November 2011 they started to build a new football stadium for TB Tvøroyri west of the sports hall. In April 2012 the football field was named &quot;Fótbóltsvøllurin við Stórá&quot; (Stórá means large or grand river, there is a river nearby with the name Stórá, hence &quot;The Football Stadium við Stórá&quot;. In English it would probably be &quot;Grand River Stadium&quot;). Earlier they had considered other names for the football stadium, the two other names which they considered were old place names from that area: &quot;Í Stópunum&quot; and &quot;Undir Brekkum&quot;. Finally they chose the name &quot;Við Stórá&quot;.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Trongisvágur include:
*Heðin Mortensen (born 1946), politician

<text>Astrometeorology (from Greek , &quot;astron&quot;, &quot;constellation, star&quot;; , &quot;metéōros&quot;, &quot;high in the sky&quot;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;branch of knowledge&quot;) or meteorological astrology is a pseudoscience that attempts to forecast the weather using astrology. It is the belief that the position and motion of celestial objects can be used to predict both seasonal climate and weather. Throughout most of its history astrometeorology was considered a scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles, often in close relation with astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, medicine, and other types of astrology.

==History==
Meteorological phenomena correlated to planetary configurations were recorded in Babylonia. Classical astrologers of note such as Claudius Ptolemy constructed a treatise on forecasting weather via astrological means. Astrometeorology is the oldest type of Hellenistic astrology. Johannes Kepler recorded meteorological observations to support his belief that the conjunction of Saturn and the Sun would produce cold weather. In 1686 a large volume written in English was devoted to astrometeorology by John Goad in his book &quot;Astro-Meteorologica&quot; published in London, England. Astrometeorological societies persisted in Great Britain until the mid-19th century but were not taken seriously by mainstream scientists. Farmers in India during the 21st century have used a form of astrometeorology based on Nakshatra that is not considered a viable practice.

<doc id="1148864" wikidata="Q1974959" url="?curid=1148864" title="World Rowing Cup">
<text>The World Rowing Cup is an international rowing competition organized by FISA (the International Rowing Federation). It began in 1997 and comprises three regattas (apart from in 2001 when there were four) held throughout early summer. In each event points are awarded to the top seven finishing boats and an overall winner determined after the last world cup regatta each year. During the regattas the current leader in each event must wear yellow bibs. The World Rowing Cup has only been staged outside Europe on 3 occasions, in 2001 Princeton and in both 2013 and 2014 Sydney.
== World Cup in single scullers (1990–1995) ==
From 1990 to 1995, the World Rowing Cup was a competition for single scullers. At three to six international regattas during one season, points for a total rating and cash prizes could be won. The World Rowing Federation wanted to better market its sport and increase sponsorship income through improved TV-presence. These goals were missed, which ultimately led to the termination of this form of the World Cup after the 1995 season.

==Editions and stages (since 1997)==

==Format==
The World Rowing Cup is an annual series of three regattas that act as a lead-up to the World Rowing Championships. Racing at the World Rowing Cup includes the 14 Olympic boat classes and a selection of International boat classes. Para-rowing is contested at some World Cups. Each Olympic boat class earns points based on the finishing order. The highest placing boat from a country is awarded the following points:

1st = 8 points, 2nd = 6 points, 3rd = 5 points, 4th = 4 points, 5th = 3 points, 6th = 2 points, 7th = 1 point

<text>Bonita Gloria Granville Wrather (February 2, 1923 – October 11, 1988) was an American actress and producer.

The daughter of vaudevillians, Granville began her career on the stage at age three. She initially began as a child actress, making her film debut in &quot;Westward Passage&quot; (1932). She rose to prominence for her role in &quot;These Three&quot; (1936), which earned her an Academy Award nomination at age fourteen. Her prominence continued with the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; film series, and roles in &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942) and &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Children&quot; (1943).

After marrying Jack Wrather in 1947, Granville transitioned into producing with her husband on series such as &quot;Lassie&quot; (1959–1973). She also worked as a philanthropist and a businesswoman, most notably owning and operating the Disneyland Hotel and the in Long Beach, with her husband. She was appointed to the John F. Kennedy Center Board of Trustees by president Richard Nixon in 1972 and for another term by President Ronald Reagan in 1982.

In addition to her Oscar nomination, Granville received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 for her contributions to the film industry. She and her husband were posthumously named Disney Legends in 2011.

==Early life==
Granville was born on February 2, 1923, in Manhattan, New York City, the daughter of Rosina (née Timponi) and Bernard Granville. Both of her parents were stage performers. She was raised Roman Catholic.

==Career==
=== 1932–1941: Child actress ===
She made her film debut at the age of nine in &quot;Westward Passage&quot; (1932), and appeared in a credited but nearly wordless supporting role as the young dancer Fanny Bridges in &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1933), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Over the next few years, she played uncredited supporting roles in such films as &quot;Little Women&quot; (1933) and &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1934). She next played the role of Mary Tilford in the 1936 film adaptation of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s 1934 stage play &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. Renamed &quot;These Three&quot;, the film told the story of three adults (played by Miriam Hopkins, Merle Oberon, and Joel McCrea) who find their lives almost destroyed by the malicious lies of an evil, attention-seeking child. For her role as that child, Granville was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, then the youngest person to be nominated for an Oscar.

In 1938, Granville was cast by Warner Bros. to play the role of girl detective Nancy Drew in a series of B movies based on the novels. The films were meant to resemble the popular Torchy Blane film series starring Glenda Farrell. Granville co-starred in the films with John Litel as her father Carson Drew, and Frankie Thomas, Jr. as Ted Nickerson. All four films — &quot;Nancy Drew... Detective&quot; (1938), &quot;Nancy Drew... Reporter&quot; (1939), &quot;Nancy Drew... Trouble Shooter&quot; (1939), and &quot;Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase&quot; (1939) — would play continuously in theaters over the next several years. Also in 1938, Granville appeared as the saucy, mischievous daughter in the multiple Academy Award-nominated hit comedy film &quot;Merrily We Live&quot;, and starred as the title character in &quot;The Beloved Brat&quot;. She also had &quot;Angels Wash Their Faces&quot; (1939) alongside Ronald Reagan, who would become a lifelong friend of hers.

In late 1939, Granville left Warner Bros. and signed a contract with MGM. However, she continued to be relegated to supporting roles in &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (1940) and &quot;H. M. Pulham, Esq.&quot; (1941), and less substantial leading roles in &quot;Those Were the Days!&quot; (1940) and &quot;Down in San Diego&quot; (1941). She and MGM soon parted ways.

=== 1942–1947: Stardom ===
In 1941, Granville signed with RKO Pictures and immediately found more substantial supporting roles in &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942) and &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942), for which she was loaned out to Paramount and Warner Bros. Following her leading role in &quot;Seven Miles from Alcatraz&quot; (1942), director Edward Dmytryk, soon cast her in RKO&#x27;s World War II anti-Nazism film &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Children&quot; (1943). The film was a commercial and critical success, becoming one of the studio&#x27;s highest-grossing films of the year, and one of the highest-grossing for both RKO and 1943. However, the studio relegated her to B-films such as &quot;Youth Runs Wild&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Truth About Murder&quot; (1946). She continued to be loaned out to other studios. For example, she was loaned to MGM for two Andy Hardy films with Mickey Rooney, &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Blonde Trouble&quot; (1944) and &quot;Love Laughs at Andy Hardy&quot; (1946), as well as a leading role in &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot; (1944); loaned to Universal for &quot;The Beautiful Cheat&quot; and &quot;Senorita from the West&quot; (both 1945); and loaned to United Artists for &quot;Breakfast in Hollywood&quot;. Following being loaned out to Monogram Pictures for &quot;Suspense&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Guilty&quot; (1947), Granville informally retired from films, only appearing in &quot;Strike It Rich&quot; (1948) and &quot;Guilty of Treason&quot; (1950).

=== 1948–1988: Later career ===
On February 5, 1947, Granville married Jack Wrather at the Bel-Air Hotel, having met him while he produced &quot;The Guilty&quot;. He formed the Wrather Corporation, and bought the rights to the characters from both &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;Lassie&quot;. Granville worked as a producer for several film and television productions featuring these characters, including the 1954 TV series &quot;Lassie&quot;.

She appeared in the film version of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; in 1956, and made her final screen appearance in a cameo role in &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot; (1981). Their children are daughters Molly and Linda, and sons Jack and Christopher. Jack and Molly were from Wrather&#x27;s previous marriage to Mollie O&#x27;Daniel, a daughter of Governor of Texas and U.S. Senator W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel. Granville&#x27;s marriage to Wrather lasted until Wrather&#x27;s death in 1984, shortly after release of the movie &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot;, a movie co-produced by Granville and starring Wrather&#x27;s friend James Stewart.

In 1949, she appeared with Rod Cameron in the comedy film &quot;Strike It Rich,&quot; filmed around Tyler, Kilgore, and Lindale in East Texas.

==Death==

Granville died on October 11, 1988, of lung cancer at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 65. She was buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California with a Catholic Mass.

==Legacy==
Granville has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6607 Hollywood Boulevard, for her contributions to motion pictures. She was honored at the Disneyland Hotel, which she and her husband owned until The Wrather Company was sold to the Walt Disney Company after Granville&#x27;s death. The Bonita Tower and the Granville&#x27;s Steak House were named in her honor. In 2011, Disney honored the Wrathers posthumously by inducting them into the Disney Legends. 

In 1942, Granville&#x27;s image was used as the heroine of the novel &quot;Bonita Granville and the Mystery of Star Island&quot;. The story, written by Kathryn Heisenfelt, was published by Whitman Publishing Company in 1942. The story was written for a young teenaged audience, and is reminiscent of the adventures of Nancy Drew. It is part of a series known as &quot;Whitman Authorized Editions&quot;, 16 books published between 1941 and 1947 that featured a film actress as heroine.

<text>Raymond Scott (born July 18, 1965), better known by his stage name Benzino or Ray Benzino, is an American urban media proprietor, television personality, rapper and record producer. Benzino produced records (as part of the production team Hangmen 3) and co-owned &quot;The Source&quot; magazine.

== Career ==
Benzino has said one of the primary inspirations to enter the genre of rap stems from his fondness of the film &quot;Wild Style&quot;. Benzino was a founding member of rap groups the Almighty RSO and Made Men. He has appeared on the reality television show &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta&quot; since 2012.
=== Feud with Eminem ===
Benzino is known for being involved since 2002 in a widely publicized feud with rapper Eminem; the feud began after his &quot;The Source&quot; magazine rated &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; as four mics out of five. Eminem blamed the magazine and its co-founder Benzino for what he considered an unfair rating. Benzino later released diss tracks towards Eminem, titled &quot;Pull Your Skirt Up&quot; (calling him &quot;2003 Vanilla Ice&quot;) and &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, while Eminem released &quot;The Sauce&quot; and &quot;Nail in the Coffin&quot;. As a continuation of this animosity between the two, Benzino released the diss mixtape &quot;Benzino Presents: Die Another Day: Flawless Victory&quot;, further disparaging Eminem.

On September 4, 2020, Benzino released a new single titled &quot;The Bigger Picture&quot; with an accompanying music video on YouTube.

==Personal life==
Benzino&#x27;s father Edward DeJesus was Puerto Rican and his mother Mary Scott was Black American and Cape Verdean. His sisters are Anita Scott-Wilson and Maureen Scott. In 2021, the rapper fell out with his daughter, Coi Leray, after she dissed Benzino in her song &quot;No More Parties&quot;.
Benzino has dated Karlie Redd and Althea Heart. Benzino and Heart had a son together in November 2015, but they broke off their engagement shortly thereafter. They appeared together on Season 6 of the television show &quot;Marriage Boot Camp&quot; chronicling their broken relationship. 

On March 29, 2014, Benzino was shot after attending his mother&#x27;s funeral in Duxbury, Massachusetts. He was shot in the shoulder and back by his 36-year-old nephew Gai Scott, who was later arrested for shooting him.
===Legal issues===
On April 16, 2019, Benzino was stopped in Brookhaven, Georgia and cited for driving an uninsured vehicle. He was not the policy holder responsible for insuring the vehicle. On June 22, 2019, Benzino was arrested for a bench warrant in DeKalb County, Georgia, and was taken to police headquarters for booking and was later jailed. As he was being transported there, he launched a racist tirade against a police officer arresting him, who was of Vietnamese descent. The tirade involved multiple racial slurs and maternal insults.

<doc id="1148880" wikidata="Q6355104" url="?curid=1148880" title="Kalam cosmological argument">
<text>The Kalam cosmological argument is a modern formulation of the cosmological argument for the existence of God. It is named after the &quot;Kalam&quot; (medieval Islamic scholasticism) from which many of its key ideas originated. Philosopher and theologian William Lane Craig was principally responsible for revitalising these ideas for modern academic discourse through his book &quot;The Kalām Cosmological Argument&quot; (1979), as well as other publications.

The argument&#x27;s central thesis is the metaphysical impossibility of a temporally past-infinite universe and of actual infinities existing in the real world, traced by Craig to 11th-century Persian Muslim scholastic philosopher Al-Ghazali. This feature distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments, such as Aquinas&#x27;s Second Way, which rests on the impossibility of a causally ordered infinite regress, and those of Leibniz and Samuel Clarke, which refer to the principle of sufficient reason.

Since Craig&#x27;s original publication, the Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and Graham Oppy, Adolf Grünbaum, J. L. Mackie and Quentin Smith, and has been used in Christian apologetics. According to Michael Martin, the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and Richard Swinburne are &quot;among the most sophisticated and well-argued in contemporary theological philosophy&quot;.

==Form of the argument==

The most prominent form of the Kalam cosmological argument, as defended by William Lane Craig, is expressed in two parts, as an initial syllogism followed by further philosophical analysis.

=== Initial syllogism ===

The Kalam cosmological argument is a deductive argument. Therefore, if its premises are true, the conclusion follows necessarily.

#Everything that begins to exist has a cause.
#The universe began to exist.
#Therefore, the universe had a cause.

=== Conceptual analysis of the conclusion ===

Craig argues that the cause of the universe necessarily embodies specific properties, in being:

*Uncaused, otherwise an infinite regress of causes would arise.
*Timeless (therefore changeless), spaceless, immaterial and enormously powerful, in creating spacetime and its contents &quot;ex nihilo&quot;.
*Personal, possessing non-deterministic agency, in creating the universe from a timeless state (without prior determining conditions).
*Singular, per Occam&#x27;s razor, in the absence of good reasons to believe in the existence of more than one uncaused cause.

Based upon this analysis, he appends a further premise and conclusion:

Craig notes the theological implications that follow from the final conclusion of this argument.

==Historical background==

The origins of the cosmological argument can be traced to classical antiquity, rooted in the concept of the prime mover, introduced by Aristotle. In the 6th century, Syriac Christian theologian John Philoponus (c. 490–c. 570) proposed the first known version of the argument based on the impossibility of an infinite temporal regress, postulating that time itself must have had a beginning.

Like other early Christian commentators, Philoponus disputed the Greek doctrine of the eternity of matter, noting that this was inconsistent with the Judeo-Christian doctrine of &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;. Furthermore, he examined the contradiction between Greek conceptions of past eternity and Aristotle&#x27;s repudiation of the existence of actual infinities. In 529, he presented his critique, &quot;On the Eternity of the World Against Proclus&quot;, categorising arguments for the finitude of the past, which underpinned his arguments for the existence of God.

Philoponus&#x27;s ideas would be developed substantially within the proceedings of medieval Islamic scholasticism—or &quot;kalam&quot;—through the 9th and 12th centuries, refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali and in the 12th by Ibn Rushd. In his landmark thesis, &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;, Persian Muslim theologian Al-Ghazali characterised the absurdity of a beginningless universe and of the existence of actual infinities, articulating a prototypical formulation of the modern Kalam cosmological argument:

:&quot;Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins;
:therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning.&quot;

In the 13th century, the cosmological argument was introduced to medieval Christian theology, wherein it would be examined by St. Bonaventure as well as Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; (I, q.2, a.3) and &quot;Summa Contra Gentiles&quot; (I, 13). Conceptions of temporal finitism that had been substantiated in Philoponus&#x27;s—and later, Al-Ghazali&#x27;s—writings inspired energetic debate between Aquinas and Bonaventure, as well as further generations of scholars up until the 18th century. Craig writes:

:&quot;It finally sputtered to something of an inconclusive end in the thought of the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century. Kant held, ironically, that there are rationally compelling arguments for both [the finitude and infinitude of the past], so that the problem is insoluble and exposes the bankruptcy of reason itself.&quot;

==Contemporary discourse==

According to Quentin Smith:

:&quot;A count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig&#x27;s defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher&#x27;s contemporary formulation of an argument for God&#x27;s existence.&quot;

The Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as J. L. Mackie, Graham Oppy, Adolf Grunbaum, Michael Martin, Quentin Smith, Wes Morriston and Alex Malpass as well as physicists Sean M. Carroll, Lawrence Krauss and Victor Stenger.

Modern discourse encompasses the fields of both philosophy and science (e.g. the fields of quantum physics and cosmology), which Bruce Reichenbach summarises as:
:&quot;... whether there needs to be a cause of the first natural existent, whether something like the universe can be finite and yet not have a beginning, and the nature of infinities and their connection with reality&quot;.

Since the temporal ordering of events is central, the Kalam argument also brings issues of the nature of time into the discussion.

==Premise one: &quot;Whatever begins to exist has a cause.&quot;==

Craig and James Sinclair propose that the first premise is obviously true, at least more plausibly true than its negation.

Craig offers three reasons to support the premise:

#Rational intuition: The first premise is self-evidently true, originating in the metaphysical intuition that &quot;something cannot come into being from nothing&quot; (Latin: &quot;ex nihilo nihil fit&quot;)—characterised in Parmenidean philosophy.
#Reductio ad absurdum: If false, it would be inexplicable why anything and everything does not randomly come into existence without a cause. To come into being without any cause is to come into being from nothing, which he says is surely absurd.
#Inductive reasoning from both common experience and scientific evidence, which constantly verifies and never falsifies its truth.

According to Reichenbach, &quot;the Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism&quot;, which can be divided into philosophical and scientific criticisms.

===Philosophical objections===

Graham Oppy, J. L. Mackie and Wes Morriston have objected to the intuitiveness of the first premise. Oppy states:

:&quot;Mackie, [Adolf] Grunbaum, [Quentin] Smith and I—among many others—have taken issue with the first premise: why should it be supposed that absolutely everything which begins to exist has a cause for its beginning to exist?&quot;

Mackie affirms that there is no good reason to assume &quot;a priori&quot; that an uncaused beginning of all things is impossible. Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience. He appeals to David Hume&#x27;s thesis (&quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;) that effects without causes can be conceived in the mind, and that what is conceivable in the mind is possible in the real world. This argument has been criticised by Bruce Reichenbach and G.E.M. Anscombe, who point out the phenomenological and logical problems in inferring factual possibility from conceivability. Craig notes:

:&quot;Hume himself clearly believed in the causal principle. He presupposes throughout the Enquiry that events have causes, and in 1754 he wrote to John Stewart, &#x27;But allow me to tell you that I never asserted so absurd a Proposition as that anything might arise without a cause&#x27;.&quot;

Morriston asserts that causal laws are physical processes for which we have intuitive knowledge in the context of events within time and space, but that such intuitions do not hold true for the beginning of time itself. He states:

:&quot;We have no experience of the origin of worlds to tell us that worlds don&#x27;t come into existence like that. We don&#x27;t even have experience of the coming into being of anything remotely analogous to the &#x27;initial singularity&#x27; that figures in the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.&quot;

Craig responds that causal laws are unrestricted metaphysical truths that are &quot;not contingent upon the properties, causal powers, and dispositions of the natural kinds of substances which happen to exist&quot;, remarking:

:&quot;The history of twentieth century astrophysical cosmology belies Morriston&#x27;s claim that people have no strong intuitions about the need of a causal explanation of the origin of time and the universe.&quot;

===Quantum physics===

For scientific evidence against the first premise, Paul Davies refers to the phenomenon of quantum indeterminacy wherein subatomic processes appear to contradict a deterministic model of cause and effect. Craig argues that, though quantum indeterminism contradicts the proposition that every event has a cause, it is nonetheless consistent with the causal premise that &quot;everything that begins to exist has a cause&quot;, encompassing the more modest view that objects cannot come into existence entirely devoid of causal conditions.

He also notes that the phenomenon of indeterminism is specific to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, pointing out that this is only one of a number of different interpretations, some of which he states are fully deterministic (mentioning David Bohm) and none of which are as yet known to be true. He concludes that subatomic physics is not a proven exception to the first premise.

====The quantum vacuum====

Philosopher Quentin Smith illustrates the example of virtual particles, which appear and disappear through fluctuations in the quantum vacuum, apparently at random, to assert the tenability of uncaused natural phenomena. In his book &quot;A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing&quot;, cosmologist Lawrence Krauss has proposed how quantum mechanics can explain how spacetime and matter can emerge from &#x27;nothing&#x27; (referring to the quantum vacuum). Philosopher Michael Martin has also appealed to quantum vacuum fluctuation models to support the idea of a universe with uncaused beginnings. He writes:

:&quot;Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused. Despite Craig&#x27;s claim that theories postulating that the universe &#x27;could pop into existence uncaused&#x27; are incapable of &#x27;sincere affirmation,&#x27; such similar theories are in fact being taken seriously by scientists.&quot;

David Albert has criticised use of the term &#x27;nothing&#x27; in describing the quantum vacuum. In a review of Krauss&#x27;s book, he states:

:&quot;Relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states—no less than giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems—are particular arrangements of elementary physical stuff. The true relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn&#x27;t this or that particular arrangement of the fields—what it is (obviously, and , and on the contrary) is the simple &quot;absence&quot; of the fields.&quot;

Craig argues that the quantum vacuum state, in containing measurable energy, cannot be characterised as &quot;nothing&quot;, therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as uncaused. On the topic of virtual particles, he writes:

:&quot;For virtual particles do not literally come into existence spontaneously out of nothing. Rather the energy locked up in a vacuum fluctuates spontaneously in such a way as to convert into particles that return almost immediately to the vacuum.&quot;

Cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin has stated that even &quot;the absence of space, time and matter&quot; cannot truly be defined as &#x27;nothing&#x27; given that the laws of physics are still present, though it would be &quot;as close to nothing as you can get&quot;.

==Premise two: &quot;The universe began to exist.&quot;==

Craig defends the second premise using both scientific and philosophical arguments for the finitude of the past.

===Cosmology and physics===

For scientific confirmation, Craig refers to evidence in cosmology and theoretical physics:

#The standard model of cosmology, which characterises the origin of the universe in the Big Bang.
#The second law of thermodynamics, which stipulates that the universe must, in a finite duration, reach a state of equilibrium known as heat death. If the universe has an infinite past, he argues, heat death would have already transpired.
#The Borde–Guth–Vilenkin theorem, according to which any universe that has, on average, been expanding throughout its history cannot have been expanding indefinitely but must have had a past boundary at which inflation began.

Professor Alexander Vilenkin, one of the authors of the Borde–Guth–Vilenkin theorem, writes:

:&quot;A remarkable thing about this theorem is its sweeping generality. We made no assumptions about the material content of the universe. We did not even assume that gravity is described by Einstein&#x27;s equations. So, if Einstein&#x27;s gravity requires some modification, our conclusion will still hold. The only assumption that we made was that the expansion rate of the universe never gets below some nonzero value, no matter how small.&quot;

According to Vilenkin and co-author Alan Guth, the past boundary described by the Borde–Guth–Vilenkin theorem does not necessarily represent a cosmic beginning, instead the beginning of cosmic inflation. Though it &quot;opens the door&quot; for theories other than an absolute beginning, in a 2012 lecture, Vilenkin would discuss problems with alternative theories that would claim to avoid a cosmological beginning (including eternal inflation, cyclic and emergent models) concluding: &quot;All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning&quot;. In publications, he would propose that the Borde–Guth–Vilenkin theorem is sufficient evidence for a beginning of the universe.

Craig has stated that, if anything existed before the past boundary described by the theorem, it would be a non-classical region described by an as-yet-undetermined theory of quantum gravity. He refers to statements by Vilenkin that, in such a scenario the non-classical region, rather than the boundary, would then be the beginning of the universe. He concludes, &quot;either way, the universe began to exist.&quot;

Victor J. Stenger has referred to the Aguirre–Gratton model for eternal inflation as an exemplar by which to avoid a cosmic beginning. In correspondence with Stenger, Vilenkin remarked how the Aguirre–Gratton model attempts to evade a beginning by reversing the &quot;arrow of time&quot; at &quot;t&quot; = 0, but that: &quot;This makes the moment &quot;t&quot; = 0 rather special. I would say no less special than a true beginning of the universe.&quot;

===Philosophical arguments===

For philosophical evidence of the finitude of the past, Craig cites:

#The Hilbert&#x27;s Hotel thought experiment, as evidence of the metaphysical impossibility of actual infinites existing in reality.
#Bertrand Russell&#x27;s tale of Tristram Shandy, as evidence of the impossibility of forming an actual infinite by successive addition.

Accordingly, he argues:

*An infinite series of past events is metaphysically impossible, given that it would represent an actual infinite existing in reality.
*Past events cannot be extended to an infinite past, given that they comprise a series formed by successive addition.

Variations of these arguments have been presented by philosopher Andrew Loke, who refers to a modified version of Hilbert&#x27;s Hotel, and Ben Waters, who has published the story of Methuselah&#x27;s Diary as a refinement of the tale of Tristram Shandy.

Craig maintains that, though it is metaphysically impossible for actual infinities to exist in the real world, they (and the absurdities that attend their existence in the real world) are describable via mathematics, therefore logically possible. He also distinguishes between actual infinities and potential infinities, stating that it is fully possible for potential infinites to exist in the real world, in contrast to the former:

:&quot;A potential infinite is a series which has a beginning and is growing indefinitely; infinity serves merely as an ideal limit of the series which it never reaches ... That’s impossible, since for any natural number &quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot;+1 is always a finite number.&quot;

====Actuality of the past====

Thomist philosopher Edward Feser has stated that the Kalam argument is based upon a presentist theory of time in which past and future events do not exist, remarking that this would be incompatible with objections against an eternal past based upon Hilbert&#x27;s Hotel:

:&quot;If the present alone is real, then how can an infinite series of events in time count as an actual infinite? Past moments of time are not actual; they no longer exist ... In the Hilbert’s hotel scenario [the rooms and guests] exist together all at once, at the same time.&quot;

Craig affirms that the simultaneous existence of the enumerated objects is irrelevant, so long as past events &quot;have been&quot; real, thus instantiated in reality, they can be counted. He refers to a narrative by Aquinas of a blacksmith who, from an eternal past, has used and broken successive hammers. He notes that the discarded hammers need no longer exist to be counted as an actual infinite. Furthermore, that the absurdities attending the existence of actual infinites in reality still apply if the enumerated objects no longer exist:

:&quot;... in an infinite series of past events, the number of odd-numbered events is the same as the number of all the events, even though the latter collection includes all the odd-numbered events plus an infinite number of even-numbered events as well.&quot;

Feser contends that past events are more analogous to abstract objects than concrete objects, such as rooms and guests relevant to Hilbert&#x27;s Hotel, noting that it is fully tenable for mathematicians to deal with infinite sets of abstract objects, such as natural numbers. For this, he refers to Aristotle&#x27;s postulate that denies the existence of time independent of &quot;objects that change&quot;:

:&quot;To speak of time apart from change is a bit like speaking of a universal like redness apart from actual red things—it is to engage in &quot;abstraction&quot; from the concrete conditions under which the thing in question (redness, or time) can actually exist.&quot;

====The Symmetry Objection====

Craig proposes that an endless future qualifies as a potential rather than actual infinite, given that future events, unlike past events, are yet to be actualised and merely potential. Morriston and Malpass argue that this asymmetry is arbitrary. They stipulate that an endless future should be deemed actually infinite, given that future events &quot;will be&quot; actual, just as past events are deemed actual in that they &quot;have been&quot;. They conclude that, if Hilbert&#x27;s Hotel disproves an eternal past, so too does it negate an endless future, contradicting Christian theology.

Commenting in agreement that future events cannot be actually infinite, Craig responds that this objection begs the question and fails to address the ontological distinction between past and future qualified by the objectivity of &quot;temporal becoming&quot; under presentism. He writes:

:&quot;The series of future events can be finite but endless. In such a case the series is potentially infinite. This is a view that is so widespread and commonly accepted in the history of philosophy and science that the objector has a considerable burden of proof to bear ...&quot;

==Conclusion: &quot;The universe has a cause.&quot;==

In a critique of Craig&#x27;s book &quot;The Kalām Cosmological Argument&quot;, published in 1979, Michael Martin writes:
:&quot;It should be obvious that Craig&#x27;s conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a &quot;non sequitur&quot;. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation.&quot;
Martin adds that Craig has not justified his claim of creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;, remarking that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in stating that the creator is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent &quot;creating&quot; a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.

===Conceptual analysis of the conclusion===

In the &quot;Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology&quot;, published in 2009, Craig and James Sinclair present a philosophical analysis of the properties of the cause of the universe, denoting that they follow by entailment from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:

#The universe must originate &quot;ex nihilo&quot; in being without natural cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world. Therefore, the cause of the universe is outside of space and time (&quot;timeless&quot;, therefore &quot;changeless&quot;, and &quot;spaceless&quot;) as well as &quot;immaterial&quot; and &quot;enormously powerful&quot;, in bringing spacetime and its contents into existence.
#Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and &quot;uncaused&quot;, otherwise an infinite regress of causes would arise, which Craig and Sinclair argue is impossible.
#Occam&#x27;s Razor maintains that &quot;&quot; of the First Cause should be assumed in the absence of specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause. 
#Agent causation, or volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only &quot;personal, free agency&quot; can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. 
#There are two conceivable categories of objects with the potential to be &quot;uncaused&quot;, &quot;spaceless&quot;, &quot;timeless&quot; and &quot;immaterial&quot;:
#*Minds (in some conceptions of mind-body dualism) may be characterised as immaterial and spatially unextended, with the potential to be &quot;unembodied&quot;, timeless, changeless and beginningless.
#*Abstract objects, such as the set of natural numbers, may be described as non-spatial and non-temporal, but do not sit in causal relationships and are therefore causally ineffective.

Based upon their conceptual analysis, Craig concludes:

:&quot;... an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists, who &quot;sans&quot; the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful.&quot;

He notes the theological implications of this union of properties:

:&quot;... our whole universe was caused to exist by something beyond it and greater than it. For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by &#x27;God&#x27; is Creator of heaven and earth.&quot;

==Theories of time==

The Kalam cosmological argument is based on the A-theory of time, also known as the &quot;tensed theory of time&quot; or presentism, in which past and future events do not exist in reality (they &quot;have existed&quot;, or &quot;will exist&quot;, but do not exist now) and only the present exists. This is opposed to the B-theory of time, also known as the &quot;tenseless theory of time&quot; or eternalism, in which past, present and future events co-exist and there is no privilege to the present other than as a frame of reference.

Under the A-theory, the passage of time and &quot;temporal becoming&quot; are objective and real features of the universe, with objects coming into being and going out of being. In the B-theory, temporal passage and becoming are illusions of consciousness. Craig explains:

:&quot;On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction. If time is tenseless, then the universe never really comes into being, and, therefore, the quest for a cause of its coming into being is misconceived.&quot;

===Neo-Lorentzian relativity===

Craig has defended the A-theory against objections from J. M. E. McTaggart and hybrid A–B theorists. He refers to the neo‐Lorentzian interpretation of the Special Theory of Relativity, which he contends has become tenable in light of recent findings in quantum mechanics concerning Bell&#x27;s theorem. Similar to Einstein&#x27;s original interpretation, the Lorentzian view describes a 3-dimensional universe existing through time, with objects in motion demonstrating time dilation and length contraction. However, these relativistic distortions occur relative to a privileged rest frame (an absolute frame of reference for the universe) rather than relative to each observer.

He writes that the Lorentzian interpretation, in postulating an absolute space and absolute time, resolves the fragmentation of reality that characterises Einsteinian relativity, in which observers in relative motion occupy different spaces and times. Importantly, Lorentz&#x27;s view of time as dynamic, and distinct from space, renders it compatible with the A-theory conception of a tensed universe.

Philosopher Yuri Balashov asserts that both consensus and evidence support Minkowski&#x27;s interpretation of relativity, which posits a 4D geometric universe inhabited by objects extended in time as well as space. In spurning the notion of a 3D universe existing in time, Minkowskian relativity rejects the A-theory, correlating instead with the B-theory conception of a tenseless spacetime. Balashov remarks:

:&quot;Despite the fact that presentism has the firm backing of common sense and eternalism revolts against it, eternalism is widely regarded as almost the default view in contemporary debates, and presentism as a highly problematic view.&quot;

Craig suggests that Balashov underestimates the challenge to Minkowskian relativity posed by recent findings. He criticises Balashov for adopting a verificationist methodology that ignores important metaphysical and theological arguments underpinning the A-theory, affirming that correct interpretation of Special Relativity is not merely a physical, but also a metaphysical question.

===Compatibility with the B-theory===

In a 2020 interview, Craig proposed that the Kalam cosmological argument could be adapted to the B-theory of time by:

*Abandoning the metaphysical argument against forming an actual infinity by successive addition.
*Modifying the causal premise (replacing its appeal to the concept of &#x27;coming into being&#x27; with the concept of &#x27;beginning to exist&#x27;).

Under the B-theory, scientific evidence for the finitude of the past would still be valid and the argument as a whole would still be tenable, though requiring reformulation to correct for the absence of objective temporal becoming. Craig articulates a B-theory version of its syllogism:

#If something exists at a time &quot;t&quot; but it does not exist at any earlier point in time then it has a cause.
#The universe does exist at time &quot;t&quot; at which there is no earlier time where the universe existed.
#Therefore, the universe has a cause.

Philosopher Ben Waters has also argued that the Kalam cosmological argument does not require a commitment to the A-theory.

==Match attendance==
Total match attendance for all games was 5,643,908 people. Attendance at the Grand Final was 91,817 people. The largest non-finals attendance was 84,894 people for the Collingwood v Essendon game in round 5.

==Awards==
* The Brownlow Medal was awarded to Simon Black of the Brisbane Lions.
* The Leigh Matthews Trophy was awarded to Luke Darcy of the Western Bulldogs and Michael Voss of the Brisbane Lions.
** This was the first year for this award under this name. Previously, it was the AFL Players Association MVP Award.
* The Coleman Medal was awarded to David Neitz of Melbourne.
* The Norm Smith Medal was awarded to Nathan Buckley of Collingwood.
* The AFL Rising Star award was awarded to Nick Riewoldt of St Kilda.

==Notable events==
* For the first time since 1965, no player kicked ten goals or more in a match.
* would appear in the finals for the first time since 1994, breaking an eight year drought, the longest in club history. They would also win their first final in twelve years since their last premiership in 1990, also the longest drought of finals wins in club history.
* won the wooden spoon for the first time. Carlton was the last of the twelve traditional Victorian clubs to win the wooden spoon in the VFL/AFL.
* played only four home games at Optus Oval, after arranging a deal to play four home games at Colonial Stadium. In order for the AFL to meet its contractual obligation to stage nine games per year at Optus Oval, six neutral games between a low-drawing Victorian team and an interstate team were staged at the venue. The unpopular venture was not repeated, as all of the home teams in these neutral games lost money due to poor crowds and, in many cases, conflicting sponsorship deals.
*Even though Adelaide was entitled to a home Semi-Final after losing its Qualifying Final to Brisbane, the game was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground due to a licence agreement which required at least one game to be played at the ground during each week of the finals.
* At the end of the season, the Carlton Football Club was found to have systematically breached the salary cap in 2000 and 2001. The club was fined and stripped of draft picks in the following two drafts, hampering their on-field results and long-term playing list rebuild in subsequent seasons.
* Sydney coach Rodney Eade resigned following round 12, after the Swans slumped to 14th on the ladder. He was eventually replaced by Paul Roos on a full-time basis, despite the board pushing for Terry Wallace, who resigned as coach of the Western Bulldogs with one round to play in the regular season, to be appointed. Roos would later coach the side to the premiership in 2005 before stepping down at the end of the 2010 season.

<doc id="1148891" wikidata="Q713397" url="?curid=1148891" title="Eastern Ye">
<text>Ye or Dongye (), which means the Eastern Ye, was a Korean chiefdom which occupied portions of the northeastern Korean peninsula from roughly 3rd-century BC to around early 5th-century AD. It bordered Goguryeo and Okjeo to the north, Jinhan to the south, and China&#x27;s Lelang Commandery to the west. Today, this territory consists of the provinces of South Hamgyŏng and Kangwon in North Korea, and Gangwon in South Korea.

==History==
Ye appears in history as a vassal state of Goguryeo. In early 5th-century, however, King Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo annexed Ye, leading to Goguryeo&#x27;s domination of the entire northern portion of the Korean peninsula and most of Manchuria. A small part of Ye in the south was absorbed into Silla.

Haslla (何瑟羅; present-day Gangneung), Bulnaeye (不耐穢; present-day Anbyon County), Hwaryeo (華麗; present-day Kumya County) are known as the countries established by Ye. According to a recent study, Siljikgok (present-day Samcheok) is also seen as an area of the Ye culture.

According to the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; and &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, fellow soldiers are as good at infantry as Okjeo. They had a sense of homogeneity with Goguryeo. It is said that it used 3 &quot;zhang&quot; (丈) long spear as a weapon and supported the army as a vassal of Goguryeo.

==People and culture==
The Ye people considered themselves to be the same people as the people of Goguryeo, and shared their language and ethnic origins with the people of Okjeo and Goguryeo. This may indicate that Dongye also shared a common origin with Buyeo and Gojoseon. The population was recorded to be 280,000 families.

Very little information about Ye has survived; most of the extant information comes from the discussion of the Eastern barbarians in the Chinese &quot;Records of Three Kingdoms&quot;. The custom of &quot;Mucheon&quot; (무천, 舞天), a festival of worshipping heaven through song and dance in the 10th month, is mentioned in some records. This appears to have been closely related to the Goguryeo festival of Dongmaeng, held at the same time of year, which also incorporated martial displays. The people worshiped the tiger as a deity.

The economy of Ye was based primarily on agriculture, including sericulture and hemp cultivation. The Mucheon festival was largely aimed at securing a good harvest in the coming year. Their agriculture appears to have been well-organised at the village level. Ye law meted out stiff penalties for those who encroached on communal land.

<text>Francisco Pelsaert ( – September 1630) was a Dutch merchant who worked for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) best known for his role as the commander of the . The ship ran aground in the Houtman Abrolhos, off the coastal regions of Western Australia in June 1629, which led to a massacre of the survivors orchestrated by Jeronimus Cornelisz.

== Background ==
Born in Antwerp, Pelsaert joined the Dutch East India Company and sailed to India in 1618, where he was posted as a junior merchant, spending seven years in Agra during which time he became a senior merchant. After a brief return to the United Provinces in 1628, he departed for Java soon after in command of the &quot;Batavia&quot;.

==&quot;Batavia&quot;==

During the voyage from the Texel to Java, a company official, Jeronimus Cornelisz, and the ship&#x27;s skipper Ariaen Jacobsz, had plotted but never attempted a mutiny against Pelsaert. Before this was possible, the ship had been wrecked. The wreck of the &quot;Batavia&quot; took place on Morning Reef, about to the south of what is now known as Beacon Island. Of the 341 passengers and crew, about 40 drowned early on while trying to reach a small island, while the rest succeeded in getting ashore. After a brief search of the island and several nearby islands, the commander realized that the islands held no natural water source, and eventually decided to head for Batavia to get help. He left with the ship&#x27;s longboat and a party of 48 officers and passengers, including one baby in arms. All survived the voyage.

Though neither sailor nor soldier, Cornelisz was the most senior VOC official left behind. After the departure of Pelsaert and Jacobsz, he assumed control of the social situation. Cornelisz and his men then began a reign of terror, murdering over 100 men, women, and children before they finally found resistance from a group of soldiers under the command of Wiebbe Hayes, who had been exiled to a neighbouring island. In October 1629, after a four-month absence, Pelsaert returned to the islands on the VOC&#x27;s ship . Cornelisz had been captured weeks earlier by Hayes&#x27; men, and he and his followers were tried and most were executed. After several weeks spent trying to salvage the Batavia&#x27;s goods, Pelsaert and the survivors returned to Java.

== Later life ==
Pelsaert&#x27;s health had suffered from the hardships, but nevertheless he took part in an expedition to Sumatra. He died in September 1630, soon after his return to Batavia. He does not seem to have taken his seat in the High Government at Batavia for which he had been selected as extraordinary member in 1629. Little of his life earnings were eventually passed to his elderly mother. He had no offspring, and no heirs for his fortune. In the end, the Dutch East India Company retained most of his earnings.

Pelsaert had secretly acquired a large sum of unauthorized goods and money before his death. These were discovered by the Dutch East India Company, and confiscated.

<text>Catherine N. Downs (March 3, 1926 – December 8, 1976) was an American film actress.

==Biography==
Downs was born in Port Jefferson, New York. She was the daughter of James Nelson Downs and Edna Elizabeth Newman.

A model for the Walter Thornton Agency, she was brought to Hollywood in 1944 by a 20th Century Fox talent scout. The studio initially used her as a model, giving her limited opportunities to act.

She began her film career with small roles in &quot;State Fair&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot; (1945). In 1946, she played the title role in &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; and Clifton Webb&#x27;s unfaithful wife in &quot;The Dark Corner&quot;. Following the success of &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;, Downs was cast in a prison drama &quot;For You I Die&quot; (1947), an Abbott and Costello comedy &quot;The Noose Hangs High&quot;, and several Western films. In 1947, Downs was dropped by Fox for unknown reasons, and was never employed by another major studio. In 1949, she participated in a later famous &quot;Life&quot; magazine photo layout, in which she posed with other up-and-coming actresses, Marilyn Monroe, Lois Maxwell, Suzanne Dalbert, Laurette Luez, Jane Nigh, and Enrica Soma. By the early 1950s, she was appearing in low-budget films, including some science-fiction (sci-fi) stories, including the 1958 sci-fi/fantasy &quot;Missile to the Moon&quot;. She appeared in a television episode of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; in 1952.
She portrayed Ann Howe in the syndicated TV series &quot;The Joe Palooka Story&quot; (1954). In 1959, she portrayed &quot;Amelia Roberts&quot; in the episode &quot;Marked Deck&quot; (S1E21) of the western TV series &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;. Downs worked sporadically on TV during the 1960s, with her final appearance in 1965 on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as murder victim and title character Millicent Barton in &quot;The Case of the Hasty Honeymooner&quot;.

Downs has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to television, at 6646 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Personal life==
On October 8, 1949, in Las Vegas, Downs married Joe Kirkwood Jr., who played the character Joe Palooka in films and on TV. The couple divorced on February 24, 1955.
On July 21, 1956, Downs married Robert M. Brunson, an electronics executive. They divorced on July 29, 1963.

Downs died December 8, 1976 of cancer in Los Angeles, California.

She is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Santa Monica, California.

<text>Dick Smith Electronics Holdings Limited was an Australian chain of retail stores that sold consumer electronics goods, hobbyist electronic components, and electronic project kits. The chain expanded successfully into New Zealand and unsuccessfully into several other countries. The company was founded in Sydney in 1968 by Dick Smith and owned by him and his wife until they sold 60% to Woolworths in 1980, and the remaining 40% two years later.

In 2012, Dick Smith had 263 stores around Australia. It also had 62 stores around New Zealand, including 20 in Auckland.

The company closed all of its stores in 2016, four years after its acquisition by Anchorage Capital Partners, though the Dick Smith brand name continues as an online brand operated by Kogan.com.

==History==
===Early years===
The business started in 1968 in a small $15-rent-per-week premises in a car park in the Sydney suburb of Neutral Bay with a total capital of only $610. Initially, the business focused on installing and servicing car radios. In 1969, the business&#x27;s success required it to move to bigger premises, first Atchison Street, St Leonards, later Carlotta Street, Artarmon with flagship store nearby, on the Pacific Highway, Gore Hill.

When the entire electronics business landscape was remodelled by the Whitlam government&#x27;s across-the-board 25% tariff cut in 1973, for the loss of 138,000 manufacturing jobs, Smith moved with the market and met the competition with a re-emphasis on imported electronic components and finished products. Alongside the car radio business, he opened &quot;Dick Smith Wholesale&quot;. The business catered to electronics hobbyists, meeting a need Smith had felt. In those days, hobbyists could buy components only from larger wholesale companies better set up for dealing with commercial customers. After touring overseas electronic stores to study modern merchandising methods, Smith introduced self-serve shopping, a breakaway from the longstanding counter-sales setup found in component sales at the time, and produced an annual mail-order catalogue with a substantial data section.

===Publicity stunts===

The company promoted itself with wacky-style and Smith&#x27;s own publicity stunts. For example, Smith claimed that he would tow an iceberg from Antarctica to Sydney Harbour, cut it up into small bits and sell it for 10 cents a cube. On the morning of 1 April 1978, it appeared as if he had succeeded as hundreds of phone calls reporting the iceberg began flooding into local newspapers and radio and television stations, most of which were from Dick Smith employees. The &quot;iceberg&quot; turned out to be a barge cloaked in white plastic sheeting and topped with firefighting foam, an April Fool&#x27;s joke.

===Expansion===

The company profited from the CB radio boom of the 1970s and by the end of the decade had stores in all mainland states. Though many CB radio stores closed when interest waned at the end of the 1970s, Dick Smith Electronics thrived on exploding PC sales and its established electronic components and kit lines.

To ensure almost every electronic enthusiast in Australia had one of his catalogues, it was included free in the popular electronics magazines &quot;Electronics Australia&quot; and &quot;Electronics Today International&quot;. The catalogues included ever-increasing amounts of data on electronic components, which helped make it an essential reference for anyone involved in electronics professionally or as a hobby.

Private-branding (as &quot;Dick Smith&quot; or &quot;DSE&quot;) was introduced on a large range of products from the late-70s. Many DSE-brand products were re-branded versions of the same or similar products sold in parallel by their manufacturers.

Dick Smith Electronics own-brand System 80 computer, which was a clone of the Tandy TRS-80 Model I, led a highly successful line, including the Dick Smith Cat (an Apple II clone), the VZ-200 and VZ-300. The company also sold brand name personal computers such as the VIC-20 and Commodore 64. In 1981, the Super-80 kit computer was developed as a joint venture between the company and Electronics Australia magazine.

The company expanded its product range, especially during the 1970s and 1980s, and stocked items such as the Heathkit electronic kits, satellite TV receiving stations, Beeple pagers and The Dick Smith Wizzard computer game. The company was an early seller of telephone equipment including answering machines, cordless and novelty phones.

=== Woolworths takeover===
In 1980, the company had grown to 20 stores and the founder and his wife sold 60% of the company&#x27;s shares to large general retailer Woolworths. The Smiths sold the balance of the company&#x27;s capital to Woolworths in 1982, the total transfer price coming to $25million. The company continued to add to its network of small &quot;main street&quot; stores in suburbs and regional cities across Australia.

====Powerhouse====

The late 1990s saw the company establish &quot;Dick Smith Powerhouse&quot; super-stores across the east coast of Australia. The first Powerhouse store was opened in Bankstown in 1996. These were several times bigger than regular stores at approximately and contained departments for the main product categories and supermarket-style checkouts. The &quot;Powerhouses&quot;, as they were known, carried a wider range of products than the smaller DSE stores, especially in the computing, audio-visual and amateur radio areas, and introduced Music to the range. Some installation services were also introduced as well as Computer repairs and upgrading.

In 2002 and 2003, the Powerhouse concept changed to focus on a broader consumer market and less towards electronics enthusiasts. Component ranges shrank and general electronics books ceased to be stocked. The Yaesu amateur radio dealership was relinquished, ending a 27-year partnership. Electronic kits were transferred to the smaller DSE stores and were replaced by the short-lived appearance of small appliances such as kettles, coffee makers, toasters and frypans. A home installation service known as &quot;PowerSquad&quot; to install major items such as TVs and computer systems or to provide set-up and training on smaller items such as wireless networking, MP3 players and iPods was offered. In late 2007, Powerhouse stores also transferred many other small components, tools, leads and connectors to small stores, continuing to distance the super-stores from the company&#x27;s electronic enthusiast roots.

====Major changes====

In early 2008, following Woolworths&#x27; review of its consumer electronics division, Dick Smith Electronics renovated its flagship store at Westfield Hornsby, as a &quot;concept&quot; under the branding &quot;Dick Smith Technology&quot;. The store&#x27;s design and product range was completely reworked incorporating a more modern feel while removing all electrical componentry and much of its tools. These products were replaced with a larger range of Windows computers, gaming, televisions and Mac computers, much of which had previously been only sold in Powerhouse stores.

Following further strategic review, the company decided to push forward with the new concept under the reworked &quot;Dick Smith – Talk to the Techxperts&quot; branding, merging all existing Dick Smith Electronics and Powerhouse stores under the same banner. In late 2008 the new Dick Smith logo and format was rolled out with many Powerhouse stores such as Macquarie Centre and Auburn being rebranded to fit the new unified company logo.

&quot;Large Format Stores&quot; opened in Chadstone Shopping Centre and Bendigo, Marion, Perth, Innaloo, Rockingham, Hobart and Stockland Rockhampton under new &quot;Dick Smith – Talk to the Techxperts&quot; branding.

In March 2009, Woolworths CEO Michael Luscombe confirmed the end of Powerhouse as a separate entity, also adding that the company&#x27;s third consumer electronics brand Tandy would be gradually phased out over the next three years as the stores&#x27; leases ended. This phase left &quot;Dick Smith&quot; as the sole brand in the parent company&#x27;s consumer electronics division.

The mail-order catalogue so central to the company&#x27;s success from the early days was last published in 2009, giving way to the online sales platform.

===Acquisition by Anchorage Capital===
On 31 January 2012, after nearly 30 years of ownership, Woolworths announced that after the results of a strategic review and a $300 million restructuring, it would close up to 100 Dick Smith stores and sell the business. The company was sold to Anchorage Capital Partners in September 2012, for an initial cash payment of $20 million and ultimate total price of some $115 million. It has been argued that Anchorage only put up $10 million in cash, the remainder of the funds being sourced from the business itself through liquidation of inventory, plant and equipment, and taking provision for future onerous lease payments, a process described as &quot;the greatest private equity heist of all time&quot;. In November 2012, Nick Abboud was appointed CEO.

In December 2013, Dick Smith was floated by Anchorage on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), becoming a public company. At the time of the listing, the market capitalisation of the company was valued at $520 million, less than two years after Anchorage had purchased the company for $20 million. Anchorage initially retained 20% of the shares in the new company but had fully divested their holdings by September 2014.

====Alliance with David Jones====
From 1 October 2013, Dick Smith took over the operation of the home entertainment department in 30 David Jones retail stores in Australia and online. The venture traded under the banner &quot;David Jones Electronics Powered by Dick Smith&quot; and promoted televisions, computers, tablets, home office, audio-visual and other digital products, with employees and inventory transferred over to Dick Smith.

By the second half of 2014, sales were running at $1.4 billion per annum.

===Fraud===
Prior to bankruptcy, management used fraudulent accounting methods to acquire $125 million in loans falsely alleging it was needed to purchase stock for boxing day sales. CFO Michael Potts was found guilty and ordered to repay $43 million to the National Australia Bank in June 2021. Around the time of closing, it was widely considered one of the largest private-equity heists of all time, with Anchorage Capital ultimately turning $10m in to $520m in less than two years. (They added $10M from Dick Smith itself in order to pay the $20M purchase price). Multiple court cases and class actions resulted. The Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission was accused of failing to act, and chose not to publish their post mortem investigations.

===Closure===

On 4 January 2016, with the value of shares in Dick Smith Holdings having fallen by more than 80% since they were listed on the ASX in December 2013, a halt in trading was requested. The following day, Dick Smith Holdings Limited (and associated entities) was placed into administration by its major creditors National Australia Bank (NAB) and HSBC Bank Australia. McGrathNicol were appointed as administrators by the company&#x27;s board but receivers Ferrier Hodgson were appointed by the creditors. CEO Nick Abboud stepped down on 12 January.

Having failed to secure a buyer for the stores, receivers Ferrier Hodgson announced, on 25 February 2016, that all 363 DSE stores in Australia and New Zealand would be closed, with the loss of 2,460 jobs.

On 15 March 2016 it was revealed that Kogan.com, the online retailer founded by Ruslan Kogan, had acquired the Dick Smith brand, trademarks, intellectual property, and its online business in Australia and New Zealand for an undisclosed price. The Dick Smith brand has been transitioned to an online-only store selling a wide variety of consumer items.

The last physical retail stores closed on 3 May 2016.

On 25 July 2016 Dick Smith Electronics&#x27; creditors placed what was then left of the company in liquidation. Creditors were expected to lose up to $260 million.

Though not connected with the company for 34 years, its founder Dick Smith expressed dismay at the closure and put it down to the &quot;utter greed of modern capitalism&quot;.

==Outside Australia==
===Hong Kong===
DSE&#x27;s first foray offshore was the establishment Dick Smith Electronics (HK) Limited in Hong Kong in 1978. It operated a small buying office and one retail store, at two locations in Ashley Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. The store targeted tourists generally and Australians, in particular, looking for tax-free DSE products. An international edition of the flagship catalogue was published in support of the operation. In the face of fierce competition from established local retailers and disappointing sales, the business closed in June 1980.

===New Zealand===
Dick Smith Electronics registered for business in New Zealand in 1981 and is believed to have opened a store the same year. In 1992, the company acquired and rebranded the retail business of David Reid Electronics, a similar chain that at one time consisted of about 30 stores. In some cases, this meant that for a time two Dick Smith stores operated in the same suburb.

In New Zealand, Dick Smith Electronics had over 75 locations. They included the &quot;Powerhouse&quot; stores, the first of which opened in Hamilton, followed by Manukau and Sylvia Park in Auckland, and Palmerston North. A third brand &quot;Dick Smith Technology&quot; store opened in Lower Hutt, following the same Powerhouse product range. Its e-commerce website had been using a search engine by SLI Systems that learns from what the users search for. The Powerhouse brand was discontinued in 2009.

===United States===
From 1980, DSE operated a small number of stores in the United States, in Northern California and Los Angeles, but had closed by the end of the decade. 

==Sponsorships==
DSE sponsored the Melbourne Stars in the T20 Big Bash League cricket, a number of tennis tournaments including the Hopman Cup, World Tennis Challenge, Brisbane International and the Sydney International.

The company was a sponsor of the National Rugby League nine-a-side tournament, the Auckland Nines and of the AFL club Richmond from 2008 until the end of 2011.

<doc id="1148914" wikidata="Q275705" url="?curid=1148914" title="9 November in German history">
<text>9 November has been the date of a series of events that are considered political turning points in recent German history, some of which also had international repercussions. In particular the anniversaries of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the beginning of the November pogroms in 1938 (German: &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; or &quot;Reichspogromnacht&quot;), the Munich Putsch in 1923 and the proclamation of the Republic in 1918 during the November Revolution in Berlin, when viewed together in their respective contexts and received in relation to one another, form contextually and ideologically contrasting and polarizing highlights of the historical-political examination of Germany&#x27;s history, especially that of the 20th century.

After the end of the Second World War, various historians and journalists coined the expression ( in German) for this date, but it only became widespread after the events of autumn 1989.

In remembrance of the November pogroms against German Jews in 1938, 9 November is a day of remembrance in Germany for the victims of Nazism — in addition to the official national Holocaust memorial day on 27 January and the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp (January 1945). 27 January is also the international day of remembrance of the victims of Nazism proclaimed by the General Assembly of the UN.

==Events==
There are eight events in German history that are connected to 9 November, five of which had considerable historical consequences: the execution of Robert Blum in 1848, the end of the monarchies in 1918, the Hitler putsch attempt in 1923, the Nazi antisemitic pogroms in 1938 and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

=== Execution of Robert Blum ===
9 November 1848: After being arrested in the Vienna revolts, Robert Blum, one of the leading figures of the democrats in the Frankfurt Parliament and in the German revolutions, was executed. The execution can be seen as a symbolic event or forecast of the ultimate crushing of the German March Revolution in April and May 1849.

=== November revolution in Berlin ===

9 November 1918: During the November Revolution, in view of the imminent defeat of the German Empire in World War I Chancellor Max von Baden announced the abdication of Wilhelm II before the Emperor had in fact abdicated, and handed the chancellorship to Friedrich Ebert (SPD). Philipp Scheidemann, who would replace Ebert as head of government in 1919, proclaimed the German republic from a window of the Reichstag. A few hours later, Karl Liebknecht, one of the leaders of the left-wing revolutionary Spartacus League (&quot;Spartakusbund&quot;), proclaimed a &quot;Free Socialist Republic&quot; from a balcony of the Berlin Palace. It was Scheidemann&#x27;s intention to proclaim the republic before the communists did.

In the ensuing conflicts between the supporters of a socialist soviet republic and those of a pluralist parliamentary democracy, which in some areas resembled a civil war, the supporters of the soviet model were defeated. Liebknecht himself was assassinated two months later, together with Rosa Luxemburg, by reactionary Freikorps on January 15. In the aftermath, the Weimar Republic was constituted in August 1919 (named after the National Assembly meeting in Weimar).

&quot;Der 9. November&quot; (The Ninth of November) is also the title of a 1920 novel by Bernhard Kellermann published in Germany that told the story of the German insurrection of 1918.

=== Hitler putsch in Munich ===
9 November 1923: The failed Beer Hall Putsch, from 8 to 9 November, marks an early emergence and provisional downfall of the Nazi Party as an important player in Germany&#x27;s political landscape. Adolf Hitler, the leader of the NSDAP party, until then hardly known to the general public, attempted a coup against the democratic Reich government on the 5th anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic. Hitler&#x27;s march through Munich was stopped in front of the Feldherrnhalle by Bavarian police who opened fire. Sixteen Nazis and four policemen were killed. 

Hitler used the subsequent trial to stage himself as the leading figure of the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement. He was sentenced to five years in prison but was released after nine months for good conduct. Only after 1930 would Hitler gain significant voter support, a process that would culminate in the Nazis&#x27; electoral victory of 1933. After his political takeover, he declared 9 November a national holiday, and every year a celebration in remembrance of the so-called &quot;Blutzeugen&quot; (blood-witnesses), the victims of the Beer Hall Putsch, took place. It was at one such ceremony, on the evening of November 8, 1939, that Georg Elser&#x27;s failed bomb assassination attempt on Hitler took place in Munich&#x27;s Bürgerbräukeller.

=== Reichspogromnacht ===

9 November 1938: Marked the culmination of what is today known as &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (the Night of Broken Glass) or Reichspogromnacht, from 9 to 10 November, synagogues and Jewish property were burned and destroyed on a large scale, and more than four hundred Jews were killed or driven to commit suicide. In Nazi propaganda, the outrages, committed primarily by SA and SS members in civilian clothes, are portrayed as an expression of &quot;popular anger&quot; against the Jews. The event demonstrated that the antisemitic stance of the Nazi regime was not so &#x27;moderate&#x27; as it had partially appeared in earlier years and marked the transition from social exclusion and discrimination to open persecution of Jews under the dictatorship. After 10 November, about 30,000 Jews were arrested; many of them later died in concentration camps.

=== Hamburg University protest ===
9 November 1967: At the inauguration ceremony of the new rector of Hamburg University, students unfurled a banner with the slogan &quot;Unter den Talaren – Muff von 1000 Jahren&quot; (English: Under the gowns – Mustiness of a 1000 years), which will become the symbol of the protests of 1968. The motto alluded to propaganda that Nazi Germany was the &quot;Tausendjähriges Reich&quot; (English: Thousand-year Reich).

=== Attack at the Jewish Community Center in Berlin ===
9 November 1969: The left-wing radical and anti-zionist terrorist organization Tupamaros West-Berlin places a bomb in the Jewish Community Center in Berlin. However, the bomb did not explode.

=== Death of Holger Meins ===
9 November 1974: The imprisoned RAF terrorist Holger Meins dies after 58 days of hunger strike.

=== Fall of the Berlin Wall ===

9 November 1989: The fall of the Berlin Wall ended the separation of Germany and started a series of events that ultimately led to German reunification. November 9th was originally considered to be the date for German Unity Day, but because it was also the anniversary of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, this date was considered inappropriate as a national holiday. The date of the formal reunification of Germany, 3 October 1990, was therefore chosen as the date for this German national holiday, and it replaced June 17th, the celebration of the uprising of 1953 in East Germany. East Germany opened checkpoints on this day which allowed people to cross into West Germany.

<doc id="1148920" wikidata="Q786942" url="?curid=1148920" title="Azania">
<text>Azania () is a name that has been applied to various parts of southeastern tropical Africa. In the Roman period and perhaps earlier, the toponym has been hypothesised to have referred to a portion of the Southeast Africa coast extending from southern Somalia to the border between Mozambique and South Africa. If this is correct, then during classical antiquity Azania was mostly inhabited by Southern Cushitic peoples, whose groups would rule the area until the great Bantu Migration.

In 1933, G.W.B Huntingford proposed a theory of Azanian civilization existing in Kenya and northern Tanzania, between the Stone Age and Islamic period. It was supposed that these people were from Ethiopia and Somalia, where they eventually perished around the 14th to 15th-century.

==Ancient Azania==
Azania was a region in ancient Arcadia, which was according to Pausanias named after the mythical king Azan. According to Herodotus, the region contained the ancient town of Paus. The use of this name coincides with a reference in which Pliny the Elder mentions an &quot;Azanian Sea&quot; (N.H. 6.34) that began around the emporium of Adulis and stretched around the south coast of Africa. It may well be that the Greek usage resonated with a term already in use around the Horn of Africa especially in the light of the fact that the term with a different meaning to the Greek Arcadian meaning, was in use in South Asia, Southeast Asia and China. The Greek Travelogue is unlikely to reflect navigation of the African East Coast.
The 1st century AD Greek travelogue the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; first describes Azania based on its author&#x27;s intimate knowledge of the area. According to the &quot;Periplus&quot;, traded items included awls, knives, glass, and iron implements, although this does not suggest the &quot;Azanians&quot; were unaware of iron smelting. Chapter 15 of the &quot;Periplus&quot; suggests that Azania could be the littoral area south of present-day Somalia (the &quot;Lesser and Greater Bluffs&quot;, the &quot;Lesser and Greater Strands&quot;, and the &quot;Seven Courses&quot;). Chapter sixteen describes the emporium of Rhapta, located south of the Puralean Islands at the end of the Seven Courses of Azania, as the &quot;southernmost market of Azania&quot;. The &quot;Periplus&quot; does not mention any dark-skinned &quot;Ethiopians&quot; among the area&#x27;s inhabitants. They only later appear in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;, but in a region far south, around the &quot;Bantu nucleus&quot; of northern Mozambique. According to John Donnelly Fage, these early Greek documents altogether suggest that the original inhabitants of the Azania coast, the &quot;Azanians&quot;, were of the same ancestral stock as the Afro-Asiatic populations to the north of them along the Red Sea. The &quot;Azanians&quot; made extensive use of small sewn boats, which were used to fish and hunt. The &quot;Periplus&quot;&#x27;s description of the &quot;Azanians&quot; is brief, merely characterizing them as &quot;Dark-skinned&quot; and &quot;Of great stature&quot;. Subsequently, by the 10th century AD, these original &quot;Azanians&quot; had been replaced by early waves of Bantu settlers.

Later Western writers who mention Azania include Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100 – c. 170 CE) and Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE).

The term was briefly revived in the second half of the 20th century as the appellation given to South Africa by Marxists such as the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) party. It has also been applied to the regional state of Jubaland within Somalia.

==Zanj Coast==
Mofarite, Hadramite and Omani merchants established various trading posts on the Zanj Coast corresponding to Azania: the South Semitic etymology of A&#x27;Zania preceded the later Arabic Al-Zanjia. The roots of &quot;land of the Zanj&quot; - &quot;Al-Zanjia&quot; however is contested as not being related to the South Semitic etymology, nor to the Greek usage referring to an Arcadian territory and legend - and pronounced differently &quot;e osania&quot;, but rather relates to Southeast Asia etymology. &quot;Zanj&quot; in Arabic means the &quot;country of the blacks&quot;. The name is also transliterated &quot;Zenj&quot;, &quot;Zinj&quot; or &quot;Zang&quot;. Anthony Christie argued that the word &quot;zanj&quot; or &quot;zang&quot; may not be Arabic in origin: a Chinese form (僧祇 &quot;sēngqí&quot;) is recorded as early as 607 AD. Christie argued that the word is South East Asian in origin. The Javanese word &quot;&quot; means African people, precisely the people of Zanzibar. It is known that the Indonesian Austronesian peoples reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 CE. As for their route, one possibility is that the Indonesian Austronesian came directly across the Indian Ocean from Java to Madagascar. It is likely that they went through the Maldives where evidence of old Indonesian boat design and fishing technology persists until the present.

<doc id="1148921" wikidata="Q1896257" url="?curid=1148921" title="Paulowniaceae">
<text>Paulowniaceae are a family of flowering plants within the Lamiales. They are a monophyletic and monogeneric family of trees with currently 7 confirmed species. They were formerly placed within Scrophulariaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, or as a segregate of the Bignoniaceae.

The Paulowniaceae are now resolved as a distinct separate family consisting of the genus &quot;Paulownia&quot;. They are deciduous trees with large heart shaped leaves and long panicles of white-purple to lavender flowers native to eastern Asia. The most widely distributed and recognized species is &quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot; with common names such as Princess tree, Empress tree, Kiri tree, Foxglove tree, and Phoenix tree.

== Taxonomy ==
There are 7 confirmed species of Paulownia with potentially more as hybrid, variety, or mismatched synonym species.

* &quot;Paulownia fargesii&quot;
* &quot;Paulownia fortunei&quot;
* &quot;Paulownia x taiwaniana&quot;
* &quot;Paulownia catalpafolia&quot;
* &quot;Paulownia elongata&quot;
* &quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot;
* &quot;Paulownia coreana&quot; (&quot;Paulownia tomentosa var. coreana)&quot;
* &quot;Paulownia kawakamii&quot;

== Phylogeny ==

Paulowniaceae is sister to the Orobanchaceae, a primarily hemi-holoparasitic plant family, except for the clade of herbaceous genera &quot;Lindenbergia&quot;, &quot;Rehmannia&quot;, and &quot;Triaenophora&quot;. Sister to the Orobanchaceae-Paulowniaceae clade is Phrymaceae. Phrymaceae are mostly herbaceous plants with a widespread distribution.

, The Plant List accepted four genera in the family. However of these four genera currently only &quot;Paulownia&quot; is a recognized member of Paulowniaceae.

* &quot;Paulownia&quot;
* &quot;Brandisia&quot; is settled in the Orobanchaceae as sister to the &quot;Pterygiella&quot; due to molecular data from 9 chloroplast markers and samples from 6 of the 11 &quot;Brandisia&quot; species. They are a mostly shrublike family with hemi-parasitic characters that sometimes grow like climbing vines. Morphological similarities between &quot;Bradisia&quot; and &quot;Pterygiella&quot;, such as eglandular hairs on their capsules, reticulate seeds, and similar shaped tricolpate pollen, confirm their close relationship.
* &quot;Wightia&quot; is now tentatively positioned as a sister group to Phrymaceae due to many morphological similarities as well as support by chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA analysis. They are a small genus of two species in Southeast Asia, that can grow as a shrub or tree, or as hemiepiphetic pseudo-vine. There are still morphological characters as well as nuclear genome data to support &quot;Wightia&quot; as sister to &quot;Paulownia&quot; leading it to be of proposed hybrid origin from Phrymaceae and Paulowniaceae. This theory, based on chloroplast genome evidence, would explain its morphological similarities to both families. However the conflicts between the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear phylogenetic data make it unclear. If these were tested further and proven to be correct it should place &quot;Wightia&quot; as a new family Wightiaceae. Though according to Liu et al., 2019, &quot;Wightia&quot; should already be its own distinct family as it is highly unlikely that any new study would provide more questionable data against this theory.
* &quot;Shiuyinghua&quot; is an accepted genus on The Plant List and is listed under Paulowniaceae, but there is no updated published work on the phylogeny of the genus or its species &quot;Shiuyinghua silvestrii&quot;. &quot;Shiuyinghua&quot; has a history of being placed under the name &quot;Catalpa silvestrii&quot; in Bignoniaceae due to its leaf shape, but then as &quot;Paulownia silvestrii&quot; in the clade Paulownieae in Scrophulariaceae due to similarities in lateral and terminal inflorescences, and in the five-lobed calyx structure. In 1959 &quot;S. silvestrii&quot; was believed to be a distinct species within the Paulownieae tribe due to the overall flower bud shape being significantly different from all other members of &quot;Paulownia&quot;. The genus was named after Dr. Shiu-ying Hu of Harvard University&#x27;s Arnold Arboretum. Since then there has been no more evidence or discussion on its placement, nor any available molecular data on a species under the name &quot;Shiuyinghua silvestrii&quot; or &quot;Paulownia silvestrii&quot;.

<doc id="1148924" wikidata="Q7798326" url="?curid=1148924" title="Throckley">
<text>Throckley is a village in the Newcastle upon Tyne district, in the county of Tyne and Wear, England, approximately west of Newcastle city centre. Hadrian&#x27;s Wall passed through the village, its course traced by the village&#x27;s main road, Hexham Road. Throckley lies within the historic county of Northumberland.

Throckley was a colliery village, being adjacent to Throckley Colliery, but with the decline in the coal-mining industry the village has become more urbanised.

The English industrialist, philanthropist and historical Lord Mayor of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Sir William Haswell Stephenson was born in Throckley and lived in the manor house Throckley Hall with his wife and two children, located in the South West of the village. Stephenson owned much of the land surrounding Throckley and the coal pits. He was Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1875, 1884, and 1894 and Lord Mayor in 1902, 1909, 1910, and 1911.

Other notable residents include William Brown, a consulting engineer in the 18th century, and part owner of Throckley Colliery, who was responsible for the construction of many colliery waggonways throughout the North East of England. As a youngster, George Stephenson worked on Dewley farm which lies to the north of the A69.

Throckley neighbours the villages of Newburn, Walbottle, Blucher, and across the border in Northumberland, Heddon-on-the-Wall. The village expanded with a number of new housing estates having been developed since the mid-2000s.

Amenities include a supermarket, car parts shop, a number of hair salons, social clubs and a working men&#x27;s club, three care homes for the elderly, two churches, a solarium, funeral parlour, an optometrist, medical surgery, a range of newsagents, a chemist, a Masonic hall, and a primary school (Throckley Primary School).

Throckley&#x27;s economy is also boosted by the presence of an industrial estate, home to Throckley Brickworks and Warmseal Windows.

== Throckley Hall ==

Throckley Hall is the original Manor House of Throckley and remains to this day. Throckley Hall was constructed in c. 1820 and expanded in c. 1850. Former Lord Mayor of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Sir William Haswell Stephenson was born in Throckley Hall, then known as Throckley House, prior to its expansion in c. 1850 and renaming to Throckley Hall, as it continues to stand to this day.

Sir William lived for many years in Throckley Hall with his wife Eliza Mary Bond and two children, Charlotte and Kate.
The Stephenson family continued to reside in Throckley Hall following the death of Sir William. Other notable residents included Major William Ernest Stephenson, who held the rank of Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers of the British Army.

Throckley Hall has been preserved and remains a private residence along with the associated land, which includes formal gardens surrounding the house as well as several acres of protected woodland and meadows. Throckley Hall retains many original and antique features, with original plaster mouldings in the hallways as well as the formal state rooms: drawing room and dining room. Throckley Hall was featured on Antiques Roadshow in 1987.

==Sightseeing and scenery==
Throckley itself, especially the Bank Top area, offers views over the Tyne Valley, and looking west, to the distant Pennines. &quot;The Guardian&quot; featured Throckley in the top fifty walks guide for 2007.

Throckley Dene is a stretch of semi-natural ancient woodland in a steep-sided valley with Dewley Burn running through. National cycle route 72 passes through South Throckley, along the edge of the River Tyne before continuing West towards Wylam Village. The South West region of Throckley contains other areas of ancient woodland, particularly around Throckley Hall and the tree-lined roads. The South West and Western regions of Throckley are designated Green Belt areas.

Throckley Pond lies south west of the village and is surrounded by woodland and meadows, several fishing platforms line the Northern shore of the pond and public footpaths extend South to the River Tyne and West towards Heddon-on-the-Wall.

== Civil parish ==
Throckley was formerly a township in the parish of Newburn, from 1866 Throckley was a civil parish in its own right, on 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished and merged with Newburn. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2332.

<text>Weight cycling, also known as yo-yo dieting, is the repeated loss and gain of weight, resembling the up-down motion of a yo-yo. The purpose of the temporary weight loss the yo-yo diet delivers is to lure the dieting into the illusion of success, but due to the nature of the diet, they are impossible to sustain, therefore the dieter gives up, often due to hunger or discomfort, and gains the weight back. The dieter then seeks to lose the regained weight, and the cycle begins again. Other individuals cycle weight deliberately in service of bodybuilding or athletic goals. Weight cycling contributes to increased risk of later obesity, due to repeated signals being sent to the body signalling that it&#x27;s in starvation mode; therefore it learns to be better and better at storing fat, and increases the strain on vital organs, likely promoting cardiometabolic disease.

==Causes==
===Dieting===
The reasons for yo-yo dieting are varied but often include embarking upon a hypocaloric diet too extreme to maintain. At first the dieter may experience elation at the thought of weight loss and pride in their self-control for resisting certain foods, e.g. junk food, desserts, and sweets. Over time, however, the limits imposed by such extreme diets cause effects such as depression or fatigue that make the diet impossible to sustain. Ultimately, the dieter reverts to their old eating habits, now with the added emotional effects of failing to lose weight by the restrictive diet. Such an emotional state leads many people to eating more than they would have before dieting, especially the &#x27;forbidden&#x27; foods e.g. junk food, desserts, and sweets, causing them to rapidly regain weight.

===Sports===
In some sports where an athlete&#x27;s weight is important, such as those that use weight classes or aesthetics, it is common for athletes to engage in weight cycling. Weight cycling is common among competitive combat sports athletes, including minors. In bodybuilding and strength sports, weight cycling is often used as a way to take advantage of the increased ability to gain muscle while in a caloric surplus by cyclically going through periods of intentional weight gain, followed by a period of weight loss to prevent excessive body fat accumulation.

===Mechanism===
The process of regaining weight and especially body fat is further promoted by the high metabolic plasticity of skeletal muscle. The Summermatter cycle explains how skeletal muscle persistently reduces energy expenditure during dieting. In addition, food restriction increases physical activity which further supports body weight loss initially. Such weight regain in the form of preferential catch-up-fat is well documented after weight loss due to malnutrition, cancer, septic shock or AIDS and thus constitutes a general phenomenon related to weight loss.

==Health effects==
Weight cycling might have negative health effects from repeated strain on the body.

A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis found that &quot;Body-weight fluctuation was associated with higher mortality due to all causes and CVD and a higher morbidity of CVD and hypertension.&quot;

A 2019 review found that self-reported weight cycling was correlated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Weight cycling is also correlated with kidney cancer, independently of whether the person is overweight.

A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found that &quot;weight cycling was a strong independent predictor of new-onset diabetes&quot;.

Weight cycling is also associated with poorer mental health.

<text>Graeme Wight Jr. (born c. 1971) is a Scottish racing driver, best known for his success in hillclimbing, where he has won two British championships.

Wight began competing in hillclimbs at an early age, but in September 1992, still only 21, he was badly injured in a road accident when the brakes failed on his Hillman Imp. It was feared that he might be paralysed, and he remained in hospital for more than two months, but by 1993 he was not only out of hospital, but competing in – and winning his class in – hillclimbs once again.

After a time in a Vision sports car in 1997 Wight won the Scottish Hillclimb Championship outright driving a Pilbeam. 1998 saw his first year of competition in the British Championship, at first in the two-litre class but then in the unlimited-capacity division. In 2000, now driving a Gould, he broke the hill record at Doune by 1.49 seconds, an astonishing margin in hillclimbing and indeed the biggest improvement in an outright record in BHCC history. After finishing fourth in the Championship that year, he finally reached the top in 2001 and 2002, winning the title in both years. Graeme became the first driver to complete the course at Shelsley Walsh in under 25 seconds when he recorded a time of 24.85 seconds on Sunday 2 June 2002, in the presence of Sir Stirling Moss. In that same year, he became the first reigning British Hill Climb Champion to be invited to drive at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

He was runner-up to Adam Fleetwood in 2003, but after that things started to go wrong for Graeme. He was Fleetwood&#x27;s main rival in the first part of the 2004 season, but delays in the appearance of his new car meant that he barely competed after mid-June and could manage only eighth place in the championship. Continued development problems in 2005 meant that he was never in the running in that season&#x27;s championship and only rarely qualified for the run-offs. He was also absent from the 2006 championship, but still hopes to return to competition.

This new car, christened the &quot;GWR Predator&quot; and of an entirely new bespoke design, is the product of a huge amount of effort. The concept of the car was to employ an ex-Arrows F1 Cosworth V10 as the powerplant, using the engine&#x27;s inherent light-weight and power to allow even further increases of power-to-weight ratio. In October 2006, however, Wight announced that the V10 engine was to be sold as he had grown frustrated of being unable to compete due to continual engine problems. He decided instead to power the car with the ex-DTM 2.5 V6 Opel Cosworth, previously used in his Gould GR51, though in the event the V10 was used in 2007 after all.

The Predator represents a huge leap the level of technology employed at what is ostensibly an amateur sport, with its combination of its ultra light weight, innovation and all-round complexity. Wight had a frustrating 2007, but late in 2008 the Predator finally came on song, and at the final round of the season, at Doune, he won the first run-off and came second in the other. Wight was thrilled with his victory, saying that &quot;the car has never been that good before&quot; and that it had been &quot;amazing&quot; through the Esses.

His father, also named Graeme Wight and sometimes known as &quot;Graeme Wight Sr.&quot; to distinguish him from his son, also competed in hillclimbs, often sharing a car with his son.

For 2009, Wight stated his intention to compete with an electrically powered machine, designed in partnership with ex-Lotus F1 designer Martin Ogilvie and Cambridge University. The car is part of the Bee 4 Motorsport project. 

This project did not last long enough for the car to be built. Wight&#x27;s main business now is building the GWR Raptor single-seaters (also designed by Ogilvie) which have won many individual events though not yet the British Championship. All Raptors so far have been powered by supercharged or naturally-aspirated Suzuki Hayabusa engines with the exception of Midland Champion Robert Kenrick&#x27;s BMW S1000RR-engined car, which has broken many records in the 601-1100cc class.

Wight competes only occasionally nowadays, but in June 2018 he set the fastest ever time for a 1600cc car (36.01 seconds) at Doune in Les Mutch&#x27;s Raptor. This did not count as a class record because it was set during one of the Championship Run-Offs.

<text>The World Rowing Championships is an international rowing regatta organized by FISA (the International Rowing Federation). It is a week-long event held at the end of the northern hemisphere summer and in non-Olympic years is the highlight of the international rowing calendar.

==History==
The first event was held in Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1962. The event then was held every four years until 1974, when it became an annual competition. Also in 1974, men&#x27;s lightweight and women&#x27;s open weight events were added to the championships.

Initially, men&#x27;s events were 2000 metres long and women&#x27;s events 1000 metres. At the 1984 World Championships in Montreal, Canada, women&#x27;s lightweight demonstration events were raced over a 2000-metre course for the first time. In 1985, Women&#x27;s lightweight events were officially added to the schedule and all men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events were contested over a 2000-metre course.

Since 1996, during (Summer) Olympic years, the World Rowing Junior Championships are held at the same time.

In 2002, adaptive rowing events were introduced for the following classes of disability: LTA (legs, trunk and arms), TA (trunk, arms), and A (arms-only). In 2009, the A category was replaced by AS (arms and shoulders), and an ID (intellectually disabled) category was added (but then removed after the 2011 Championships). From 2017, the designations AS, TA, and LTA have been changed to PR1, PR2, and PR3.

==Boats==
Rowing takes place in 21 different boat classes, apart from during Olympic years when only non-Olympic boat classes race. National teams generally take less interest in the non-Olympic events, as the Olympic events are considered the &quot;premier&quot; events.

The table below shows the boat classes, &quot;O&quot; indicates the boat races at both the Olympics and World Championships. &quot;WC&quot; indicates this is only a World Championship event. After 2007, the coxed fours (4+) no longer runs as a world championship event. Similarly after 2011 the women&#x27;s coxless four was no longer included, but it was reintroduced in 2013. Lightweight men&#x27;s eight was removed after 2015.

As a result of the IOC&#x27;s aim for gender parity, it has been agreed that for 2020 onwards the lightweight men&#x27;s coxless four will be removed from the Olympics and replaced by women&#x27;s coxless four.

At the 2017 FISA Ordinary Congress there were further revisions, removing M2+ and LM4- from the World Championships, and reinstating LW2-.

==Editions==
World Rowing Championships have been held since 1962; first every four years, then annually since 1974 (except 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

<doc id="1148941" wikidata="Q55136710" url="?curid=1148941" title="The Bard's Tale">
<text>The Bard&#x27;s Tale is a fantasy role-playing video game franchise created by Michael Cranford and developed by Brian Fargo&#x27;s Interplay Productions (1985–1992) and inXile Entertainment (2004–present).
The initial title of the series was Tales of the Unknown. &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II: The Destiny Knight&quot; dropped the &quot;Tales of the Unknown&quot; series title, as did all ports of the original game after 1988. From then on, the series was known as &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series. Both Cranford and Fargo have refuted the assertion that the original projected titles for the second and third installments were &quot;The Archmage&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Thief&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

After the first three games, work on a fourth installment began but it became an unrelated game, &quot;Dragon Wars&quot;, at a very late point in development due to rights issues when Interplay parted ways with their publisher. The series was not continued for many years and is thus still often referred to as the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale trilogy&quot;. In 2018, Alex Santa Maria stated that &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; was &quot;One of the most classic franchises in PC gaming&quot;.

==Games==

* &quot;Tales of the Unknown: The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985): In the series&#x27; eponymous first game, the evil wizard Mangar has cast a spell of eternal winter on the small country town of Skara Brae to isolate it, and the player controls a group of adventurers who seek to find and defeat Mangar to free the town.
* &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II: The Destiny Knight&quot; (1986): To save the realm, the group must find the seven pieces of the Destiny Wand, reforge it (so that an Archmage from the group can become the legendary Destiny Knight), and confront the evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta.
* &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale III: Thief of Fate&quot; (1988): The mad god Tarjan, Mangar&#x27;s master, has returned to Skara Brae and destroyed the city, though as it turns out this was only a small facet of his revenge. In their attempt to stop Tarjan, the group becomes embroiled in a war among gods across several dimensions.
* &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale Construction Set&quot; (1991), a game creation system that allows for the creation of dungeon crawl video games based on the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; game engine.
* &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2004): Action role-playing video game created by Brian Fargo and published by Fargo&#x27;s InXile Entertainment; not a proper part of the original series. Brian Fargo only had the rights to the name but not to the content/stories of the earlier games in the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series at that point.
*&quot;The Mage&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2017): A side-story game set in the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; universe, developed by inXile alongside &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot; and released in 2017. Like other games in the series, it is a first-person dungeon crawler, but is built for virtual reality, featuring action-based spellcasting, rather than turn-based combat. 
*&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV: Barrows Deep&quot; (2018): A proper fourth part of the original series was successfully funded as a Kickstarter project in 2015 by InXile Entertainment, and released in 2018. Two centuries after the initial trilogy&#x27;s events, a primordial evil seeks to free itself and must be stopped—and Skara Brae, as it turns out, is located just above the critical place for this.While continuing the story from the original trilogy, the game significantly expanded and reframed the existing lore such as it was in the old games, and the actual gameplay was completely overhauled and is arguably more similar to the 2004 game than to the first three games.
*&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale Remastered Trilogy&quot; (2018): A spinoff project of the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot; project, the &quot;Remastered Trilogy&quot; is a re-creation of the original trilogy for modern computers, with updated graphics and user interface, bugfixes, and other quality-of-life improvements. The games were also expanded slightly, to retroactively connect them to the plot and expanded setting of &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot;.
*&quot;The Bard’s Tale: Warlocks of Largefearn&quot; (2022): A spinoff voice-driven game developed by Polar Night Studio for Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IOS and Android. Features a semi-open world, taking place in the settlement town of Largefearn. Includes several companions to recruit and a turn and tile-based combat system.

==Books==
===Cluebooks===
Official Cluebooks were published by Electronic Arts for the first three &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; games. These untitled books expanded on the games&#x27; stories and added new characters:

The cluebook for the first game (1986, ) was written by T.L. Thompson as an in-universe document, the journal of a lord who had very nearly succeeded in solving the quest before finding that his party had lost crucial items required to overcome the final hurdle. The party was implicitly wiped out just short of defeating Mangar but had seen to it that the journal would reach friendly hands.

The cluebook for the second game (1987) was written by T.L. Thompson and David K. Similarly as a short story, narrating how a party of adventurers asks a wizard to foretell their (possible) future by means of a divination spell, if they should attempt the game&#x27;s quest to find the Destiny Wand and defeat Lagoth Zanta. The resulting trance vision of the possible future reflects poorly on the character of the group&#x27;s leader, who is also shown to get assassinated at the end, and it is implied that this particular group will thus not embark on the quest after all even though they technically succeeded in the vision.

The cluebook for the third game (1988, ) was written by David Luoto in the style of a novella. The protagonist, Arbo, is initially a lazy and useless squire who is &quot;volunteered&quot; by his master to a party of adventurers at Skara Brae. The group proceeds to bring order to the dimensions and best Tarjan, and in the process form Arbo into a resourceful and responsible adult.

===Novels===
A series of novels based on &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; were published by Baen Books during the 1990s. They include:
#&quot;Castle of Deception&quot;, by Mercedes Lackey and Josepha Sherman (1992, )
#&quot;Fortress of Frost and Fire&quot;, by Mercedes Lackey and Ru Emerson (1993, )
#&quot;Prison of Souls&quot;, by Mercedes Lackey and Mark Shepherd (1994, )
#&quot;The Chaos Gate&quot;, by Josepha Sherman (1994, )
#&quot;Thunder of the Captains&quot;, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1996, )
#&quot;Wrath of the Princes&quot;, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1997, )
#&quot;Escape from Roksamur&quot;, by Mark Shepherd (1997, )
#&quot;Curse of the Black Heron&quot;, by Holly Lisle (1998, )

While they are listed here in the order they were published, some books in the series connect more than others, such as &quot;Castle of Deception&quot; and &quot;The Chaos Gate&quot;, &quot;Prison of Souls&quot; and &quot;Escape from Roksamur&quot;, and &quot;Thunder of the Captains&quot; and &quot;Wrath of the Princes&quot;.

As part of the crowdfunding campaign for &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot;, six novels set within the redefined setting from &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot; and the Remastered edition of the original trilogy were provided to backers in EPUB format in 2018. Three of them are novelized re-tellings of the first three games&#x27; storylines by Nathan Long, who wrote the storyline for part four. They follow a group of six heroes as they proceed through the first three games&#x27; storylines, reframing the original trilogy within the larger story. Compared to the games or earlier cluebooks, they are written with considerable artistic license, omitting or altering many details.

==Reception==
By 2003, &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series had sold over a million copies.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the series (referring to the first three parts of the original trilogy plus the construction set at the time) collectively as number 62 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, praising the all-in-one interface using multiple display windows and the unparalleled level of plot detail and development. In 2018, Alex Santa Maria stated that it was &quot;One of the most classic franchises in PC gaming&quot;.

<doc id="1148945" wikidata="Q482065" url="?curid=1148945" title="Atsuta Shrine">
<text>is a Shinto shrine, home to the sacred sword &quot;Kusanagi no Tsurugi&quot;, one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan—traditionally believed to have been established during the reign of Emperor Keikō (reigned 71–130 CE). It is located in Atsuta-ku, Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture in Japan. The shrine is familiarly known as &quot;Atsuta-Sama&quot; (Venerable Atsuta) or simply as &quot;Miya&quot; (the Shrine). Since ancient times, it has been especially revered, ranking with the Ise Shrine.

The shrine complex draws over 9 million visitors annually.

==History==

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; explains that Atsuta Shrine was founded to house the &quot;Kusanagi no Tsurugi&quot;, a legendary sword.

According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the 43rd year of Emperor Keiko&#x27;s reign (景行天皇43年, equivalent 113 AD). The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine. &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; explains that this move occurred in the 51st year of Keiko&#x27;s reign, but shrine tradition also dates this event in the 1st year of Emperor Chūai&#x27;s reign.

The Owari clan had established the Atsuta Shrine in 192, and held the position of the shrine&#x27;s high priest since ancient times, passing it down from generation to generation. However, in 1114, Kazumoto handed the position over to Fujiwara no Suenori, who was from the Fujiwara clan. Since then, the Fujiwara clan became the head of Atsuta Shrine, while the Owari clan stepped down to the position of adjutant chief priest (&quot;gongūji&quot;).

During the Northern and Southern Courts Period, because it was believed that the &quot;Kusanagi no Tsurugi&quot; was or had once been housed there, the Atsuta Shrine proved to be a significant site in the struggle between ousted Emperor Go-Daigo (Southern Court) and the new emperor, Takauji Ashikaga (Northern Court). Go-Daigo was a patron to Atsuta Masayoshi, the shrine&#x27;s attendant, who subsequently fled with him to Mt. Hiei in 1336 and went on to command troops on Go-Daigo&#x27;s behalf in 1337. In 1335, after rebelling against Go-Daigo, Takauji appointed a new shrine attendant. He later prayed there while advancing on the capital, mimicking the behavior of Minamoto no Yoritomo, who had done the same before founding the Kamakura shogunate.

In 1338, the Southern Court had one more chance to occupy the shrine when Kitabatake Akiie led a large army down from the Southern Court&#x27;s base on Mount Ryōzen. In the first month of 1338, Akiie also prayed at the shrine. However, he was killed in battle soon after and the Ashikaga cemented their control over Atsuta Shrine.

From 1872 through 1946, Atsuta Shrine was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.

The shrine area was originally much larger. To the northeast were vast ricefields that belonged to the shrine, they were later built over in what became Sanbonmatsu-chō (三本松町) and Mutsuno (六野) neighbourhoods, the Jingū Higashi Park (神宮東公園) established in the 1980&#x27;s is a restoration of greenery to the site.

===Architecture===

The shrine&#x27;s buildings were maintained by donations from a number of benefactors, including well-known Sengoku period figures like Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the Tokugawas. For example, the &quot;Nobunaga-Bei&quot;, a 7.4 m high roofed mud wall, was donated to the shrine in 1560 by Nobunaga as a token of gratitude for his victory at the Battle of Okehazama. A wooden gate called &quot;Kaijō-mon&quot; (海上門 lit. &quot;Sea Gate&quot;) was made along with the mud wall. This gate was a National Treasure and was lost during the Pacific war bombings on 17 May 1945. The west gate was a larger wooden structure called &quot;Chinkō-mon&quot; (鎮皇門) that was used for imperial processions. It was dedicated by Kato Kiyomasa. This gate was also registered as a national treasure, it was lost 29 July 1945 in another air raid. and replaced with a simple wooden &quot;torii&quot;. The east gate &quot;Shunkō-mon&quot; (春敲門) was dedicated to Yang Guifei, who according to legend found refuge here. A water spring is also connected to her legend.

In 1893, it was remodeled using the &quot;Shinmeizukuri&quot; architectural style, the same style used in the building of Ise Shrine. Before a celebration in 1935, the shrine&#x27;s buildings as well as other facilities were completely rearranged and improved in order to better reflect the history and cultural significance of the shrine.

During the aerial raids of the Pacific War, however, many of Atsuta Shrine&#x27;s buildings were destroyed by fire. The shrine&#x27;s main buildings, such as the &quot;honden&quot;, were reconstructed and completed in 1955. Following the completion of these buildings, construction of other buildings continued on the shrine grounds. In 1966 the Treasure Hall was completed in order to house the shrine&#x27;s collection of objects, manuscripts and documents.

Augmented reality was developed to see structures that have been lost over time.

==Shinto belief==
This Shinto shrine is dedicated to the veneration of &quot;Atsuta-no-Ōkami.&quot; Also enshrined are the &quot;Five Great Gods of Atsuta&quot;, all of whom are connected with the legendary narratives of the sacred sword — Amaterasu-Ōmikami, Takehaya Susanoo-no-mikoto, Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto, Miyazu-hime, and Take Inadane-no-mikoto.

Atsuta is the traditional repository of &quot;Kusanagi no Tsurugi&quot;, the ancient sword that is considered one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan. Central to the Shinto significance of Atsuta Shrine is the sacred sword which is understood to be a gift from Amaterasu Ōmikami. This unique object has represented the authority and stature of Japan&#x27;s emperors since time immemorial. Kusanagi is imbued with Amaterasu&#x27;s spirit.

During the reign of Emperor Sujin, duplicate copies of the Imperial regalia were made in order to safeguard the originals from theft. This fear of theft proved to be justified during the reign of Emperor Tenji when the sacred sword was stolen from Atsuta; and it was not to be returned until the reign of Emperor Tenmu. There is also the purported loss of the Kusanagi during the 1185 Battle of Dan-no-ura, where it was presumed lost at sea when the Emperor Antoku committed suicide by drowning together with remnants of the Heike. Although not seen by the general public since that time, it is said to have remained in safekeeping at the shrine up to the present day.

==Treasures==

The shrine&#x27;s &quot;Bunkaden&quot;, or treasure hall, houses over 4,000 relics, which include 174 Important Cultural Properties and a dagger that is a designated National Treasure of Japan. Atsuta Jingu Museum preserves and displays a variety of historic material, including the &quot;koshinpō&quot; (sacred garments, furniture and utensils for use of the enshrined deities). A number of donated swords, mirrors and other objects are held by the shrine, including &quot;Bugaku&quot; masks and other material associated with ancient court dances. The &quot;Bunkaden&quot; collection ranges from ancient documents to household articles. Aichi Prefecture has designated 174 items as important cultural assets.

==Festivals==
Over 70 ceremonies and festivals are held annually at the shrine.

* &quot;Hatsu-Ebisu&quot; (January 5): Seeking good fortune in the new year from Ebisu, the &quot;kami&quot; of Fortune.
* &quot;Yodameshi Shinji&quot; (January 7): The projected annual rainfall for the coming year is prophesied by measuring the amount of water in a pot kept underneath the floor of the Eastern Treasure House.
* &quot;Touka Shinji&quot; (January 11): A variation on an annual ceremony (&quot;Touka-no-sechie&quot;) of the Imperial Court in the Heian period (10th-12th Century), the shrine dance becomes a prayer in movement hoping for bumper crops of the year.
* &quot;Hosha Shinji&quot; (January 15): Ceremonial which involves shooting an arrow at a wooden piece called &quot;chigi&quot; fixed at the center of a huge mark.
* &quot;Bugaku Shinji&quot; (May 1): A ceremonial dance from the Heian era is performed outdoors on a red painted stage.
* &quot;Eyoudo Shinji&quot; (May 4): A festival to commemorate the return of the sacred sword in the reign of Emperor Tenji.
* &quot;Shinyo to Gyoshinji&quot; 神輿渡御神事 (lit. &quot;&quot;Mikoshi&quot; passing ritual&quot;) (May 5): A festival in which portable shrine (&quot;mikoshi&quot;) is carried in a formal procession to the western gate &quot;Chinkō-mon&quot;, where ceremonies and prayers for the security of the Imperial Palace are performed in the open air. In the Meiji and Taishō era, this procession moved in sober and solemn silence. The ceremony at the gate was brief, lasting only 20 minutes; and then the &quot;mikoshi&quot; and its attendants returned into the Shrine precincts. &quot;Shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimasa provided a new &quot;mikoshi&quot; and a complete set of robes and other accouterments for this festival on the occasion of repairs to the shrine in the 1457-1459 (&quot;Chōroku 1-3&quot;).
* &quot;Rei Sai&quot; (June 5): Portable tabernacles (&quot;mikoshi&quot;) in various styles are carried along the approaches to the shrine; and at night, groups of 365 lanterns (&quot;makiwara&quot;) appear lit at the gates. This festival commemorates an Imperial proclamation (&quot;semmyō&quot;) issued in 1872 (&quot;Meiji 5&quot;). After 1906 (&quot;Meiji 39&quot;), exhibitions of judo, fencing (&quot;gekken&quot;), and archery (&quot;kyūdō&quot;) are presented for the gratification of the &quot;kami.&quot;

<text>Lifehouse Chronicles is a box set released in 2000 by Pete Townshend with the focus of the box being the formerly &quot;abandoned&quot; &quot;Lifehouse&quot; rock opera. The set contains song demos by Pete Townshend; including solo versions of &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, and &quot;Who Are You&quot;, and the Lifehouse Radio Program. The box set release was followed by two Sadler&#x27;s Wells Lifehouse concerts and the release of a live CD and video/DVD titled, respectively, &quot;Pete Townshend Live: Sadler&#x27;s Wells 2000&quot; and &quot;Pete Townshend – Music from Lifehouse&quot;.

==Concept==
The set collects songs and other compositions relating to &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, a musical concept developed by Townshend in 1970 as a follow-up to The Who&#x27;s highly successful rock opera, &quot;Tommy&quot;. Rooted heavily in the teachings of Townshend&#x27;s spiritual mentor Meher Baba as well as in science fiction literature, &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was meant to explore the idea that music is the fundamental basis of all life – that every human being on Earth has a unique musical melody that &quot;describes&quot; them, and only them, perfectly. When the unique songs of enough people are played in unison, the result would be a single harmonic note – the One Note – akin to the quintessence sought by ancient alchemists. &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was to be a true multimedia project: a double LP rock opera, a motion picture, and an interactive concert experience.

The story was to take place in 21st century Britain, in an age where pollution has become such a drastic problem that most people never set foot outdoors in their life. This populace spends most of their time in &quot;experience suits&quot;. These suits provide the people with artificial lives superior to any they could eke out in the real world, yet devoid somehow of spiritual fulfilment. One discontented soul, known only as &quot;The Hacker&quot;, rediscovers 20th century rock and roll music, and breaks into the computer network controlling the suits to invite people to leave their suits and come together for a concert. Despite the best efforts of the fascist government, thousands of people gather at the Hacker&#x27;s concert, with millions more watching through their suits, as the musicians and audience perform experimental songs like those described above. Just as the police storm in and shoot the Hacker, the audience and band manage simultaneously to produce the perfect universal tone, &quot;The One Note&quot;, and everyone participating in and watching the concert simply vanishes, presumably having departed for a higher plane of existence. The story is seen through the eyes of a middle-aged farmer named Ray, a farmer from a remote unpolluted corner of Scotland, who travels south looking for his daughter who has run away to the concert.

==History==
===1970–1971===
In September 1970, Townshend penned a song called &quot;Pure and Easy&quot;, about the One Note, the first song written specifically for &quot;Lifehouse&quot;. In the following two months he wrote approximately 20 additional songs, recording intricate home demos of each. Rather than attempting to tell the story through the lyrics, as he had done with &quot;Tommy&quot;, the songs were stand-alone pieces, meant to be elucidated by the movie and detailed sleeve notes to be included with the album. Most of those songs were recorded by the Who in two sessions in the winter of 1970/1971, as well as several &quot;rehearsals&quot; accompanied by guitarist Leslie West of the band Mountain and an impromptu live concert at the Young Vic Theatre in London in April 1971.

While Townshend had high hopes for the project, others were skeptical. Universal Studios, which had recently inked a two-film deal with the Who for the rights to a film version of &quot;Tommy&quot;, was not impressed by the screenplay Townshend offered them. A series of spontaneous concerts the Who had held in London failed to produce usable material, and it soon became apparent that the project was doomed to failure. Though many of the songs written for &quot;Lifehouse&quot; came to be released on the Who album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was to remain unfinished for nearly thirty years.

===1971–1998===
Townshend never abandoned hope that &quot;Lifehouse&quot; might someday become a reality. He continued to write songs for the project throughout the &#x27;70s, and in 1980 worked together with bandmate John Entwistle to produce a new screenplay with a new story. Negotiations to produce this film, however, fell apart when Townshend found himself infatuated with the wife of the film&#x27;s director (a story recounted in the song &quot;Athena&quot;, to be found on the Who album &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot;).

It was not until 1992 that Townshend again began work on the project. In that year, Townshend recorded the solo album &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;, a semi-biographical story told in the style of a radio play. The hero of this piece, like Townshend, is an aging rock star labouring tirelessly on a 20-year-old rock opera, called &quot;Gridlife Chronicles&quot; in the story, who finds himself embroiled in a sex scandal that jeopardises the future of the project. Several of the synthesizer pieces Townshend recorded in 1970 make their first official appearance on this album.

In 1998, Townshend&#x27;s dream of bringing &quot;Lifehouse&quot; to a wide audience finally came true, when BBC Radio approached him with the idea of developing a radio play based on &quot;Lifehouse&quot; and incorporating the original music written for the project. The play, just under two hours in length, was transmitted on BBC Radio 3 on 5 December 1999.

==The box set==
Following the broadcast of the play, Townshend assembled and released the &quot;Lifehouse Chronicles&quot; box set in 2000 as a formal culmination of his work on the project. The set, made available exclusively through his website and at concerts, consists of six CDs. The first two CDs collect the original demos he recorded of the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; songs, several of which were never recorded by The Who. The third disc consists of several of Townshend&#x27;s experimental synthesizer pieces, live recordings of &quot;Lifehouse&quot; songs, and new studio recordings of those songs produced especially for the set. The fourth disc features classical music by the London Chamber Orchestra which was used in the radio play, featuring compositions by Townshend as well as selections by Baroque composers Henry Purcell, Domenico Scarlatti and Michel Corrette. The fifth and sixth discs contain the radio play itself. Included with the set is a booklet featuring an introduction by Townshend, a history of the project written by Townshend webmaster/publicist Matt Kent , lyrics for most of the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; songs, and a script of the play. Townshend stated in his introduction that he eventually hoped to release an expanded version of the set, to be titled &quot;The Lifehouse Method&quot;, which would include software for producing a synthesizer track based on the user&#x27;s vital statistics. Instead, The Lifehouse Method debuted in early 2007 as a website. After generating some 10,000 new pieces of music for users, the project closed. The artwork and design of the box set was created by designer Laurence Sutherland.

<text>The Bard&#x27;s Tale is an action role-playing game developed and published by inXile Entertainment in 2004 and was distributed by Vivendi Universal Games in North America and Ubisoft in Europe (The game was originally going to be distributed by Acclaim Entertainment there, until they filed for bankruptcy ). The game was marketed as a humorous spoof of fantasy role-playing video games. It is neither a remake nor a sequel to Interplay Productions&#x27; &quot;Tales of the Unknown, Volume I: The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985).

&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2004, and for Microsoft Windows in June 2005. The game was re-released on Steam in December 2009. A universal iOS version was released in December 2011 for iPhone and iPad along with the Android version. The BlackBerry PlayBook version was released in September 2012. In June 2013, the game was also ported to Ouya with full controller support.

The game was remastered in 2020 and released under the title &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale ARPG: Remastered and Resnarkled&quot;.

==Gameplay==

Unlike the turn-based, first-person view of the classic &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; games, this game is in a 3D environment with the player watching the only controllable character from an overhead vantage point. It is better described as an action-adventure game than a traditional role-playing video game (i.e. there are no character classes or inventory management).

The player&#x27;s character, The Bard, has magic and weaponry at his disposal to complete the task. The more the player accomplishes, the better his skills will become. The appearance and gameplay is much the same as the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; series, which shares the same graphics engine.

In game dialogue uses a &quot;snarky or nice&quot; system that allows the player to change the outcome of many situations by deciding how they want to respond. The player doesn&#x27;t know exactly what The Bard will say, but must choose between two labelled buttons. Some choices, such as being snarky to the dog at the beginning of the game, have game-lasting consequences. The first decision is whether to be nice or snarky to the barmaid in The Drunken Rat. Being nice to her gives her the impression that The Bard is a gentleman and she leaves him alone, while being snarky ensures The Bard will spend the night with her. 

==Plot==
Although touted in early promotional materials as a remake of the classic &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series, InXile Entertainment never had any rights to the series&#x27; trademarks of the original &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; — those rights are still owned by Electronic Arts. This meant that InXile was not legally allowed to use any of the plot, characters or locations featured in the original trilogy. However, allusions to the original &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; do exist in the game. The city in which Fionnaoch&#x27;s tower stands, Dounby, is only a few kilometres away from the ruins of real-world Skara Brae, where the original trilogy takes place. The PC, Android, and iOS ports of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; come packaged with the original &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; trilogy.

The plot involves &quot;a sardonic and opportunistic musician and adventurer, driven by carnal rather than noble pursuits. The Bard, who is never identified by a specific name nor addressed by anything other than &#x27;The Bard,&#x27; is not interested in saving the world; his humble motivations are strictly &#x27;coin and cleavage.&#x27;&quot; His quest is narrated by a mocking, biased man (played by Tony Jay) who cannot stand him. Many of the names and characters are influenced by Celtic mythology and the stories of the Orkney Islands. (Most of the names for places are actual locations in the Orkney Islands, including Kirkwall, Dounby, Finstown, Houton, and Stromness. Some optional areas are places in Ireland, including Dún Ailinne, Ardagh, Carrowmore, Emain Macha, and Tara.)

The Bard (voiced by Cary Elwes) ends up being recruited by a cult to help free a princess named Caleigh. As a result of this, The Bard finds himself being attacked by an assortment of fanatics from a Druid-like cult, sent to dispatch him by a being called Fionnaoch. On the way to complete his quest, the not so valiant anti-hero will have to overcome the truly terrifying challenges of three monstrous guardians, break-dancing corpses, spontaneously melodious goblins, a giant, and a fire-breathing rat.

Eventually, it is revealed that The Bard is just another in a long line of &quot;Chosen Ones&quot;, many of whom he finds dead along his path. Caleigh is revealed to actually be a demon tempting people to come free her for years on the assumption that eventually someone would succeed. If The Bard frees Caleigh, she gives him all his heart&#x27;s desires while destroying the world. If he slays Caleigh, The Bard returns to the road in search of the next bar maid. Alternatively, he can refuse to fight either the Druid Leader or Caleigh, allowing the undead to overrun the world, a situation he is content with as they make good bar buddies.

== Reception ==
The PlayStation 2, Xbox, and iOS versions received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, while the PC version received &quot;average&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the iOS version a score of B+, praising the narration of Tony Jay, &quot;whose incredulity and exasperation with pretty much everything in the game is a warm delight.&quot; &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; awarded the Xbox version three stars out of four and opined it was &quot;one of the few games that is downright funny, and there were honest laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout it that kept me playing.&quot; &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five: &quot;The story and dialogue never cease to entertain. Objectives include rescuing prisoners, killing fearsome scarecrows and playing Cupid. But, although the developers want to ridicule, the action remains conventional.&quot;

During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; for &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Character Performance - Male&quot; for Cary Elwes&#x27; vocal portrayal of the Bard.

<text> is a farm in the North West province of South Africa that is noted for its unusually long place name of 44 characters—the longest in South Africa and possibly fourth-longest in the world. Located in the Ditsobotla Local Municipality of the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality, some east of the town of Lichtenburg and west of Pretoria, the name in Afrikaans means &quot;the spring where two buffaloes were shot stone-dead with one shot&quot; (). Originally granted to A.P. de Nysschen on 24 April 1866 by the government of the South African Republic, is also sometimes known by the shortenings (Two buffaloes) and (Two buffaloes shot).

== Name ==
The name in Afrikaans means &quot;the spring where two buffaloes were shot stone-dead with one shot&quot; (). 44 characters long, it is the longest place name in South Africa and possibly fourth-longest in the world. The literal translation is &quot;Twee buffels&quot; = &quot;Two buffaloes&quot;, &quot;met een skoot&quot; = &quot;with one shot&quot;; &quot;&quot; = &quot;stone dead&quot;; &quot;&quot; = &quot;shot&quot;; &quot;&quot; = &quot;spring (river source)&quot; or &quot;fountain&quot;. For brevity, it is sometimes known by the shortenings (Two buffaloes) and (Two buffaloes shot).

The name follows a common format for Afrikaans-language place names in South Africa, and illustrates the compounding nature of Germanic languages including Afrikaans, itself derived from Dutch. All the descriptive terms relating to one concept can generally be tied together into one long word. Another example of this would be &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;education leadership development project.&quot; Such use is, however, not common, and such words are often separated using one or more hyphens if they become too long or unwieldy.

== Farm ==
The farm consists of a farmhouse and ranch, and is located in the Ditsobotla Local Municipality of the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality, North West province of South Africa some east of the town of Lichtenburg and west of Pretoria.

== History ==
The farm was originally granted to A.P. de Nysschen on 24 April 1866 by the government of the South African Republic. It is referred to in a 1914 survey diagram as &quot;&quot; (Two buffaloes shot) and shown as having an area of 6,119 morgen and 429 square roods (5241.7 hectares). Records from British concentration camps during the Second Boer War records five residents of in 1901. In 1985, was the subject of an Afrikaans-language song written by and performed by Anton Goosen. Rautenbach had originally written the song in 1978, and it tells of the supposed hunter Gysie Grootlief who volunteers to shoot a giant buffalo with twelve-foot wide horns terrorising the hamlet of Sannaspos.

<text>Steffi Duna (born Erzsébet Berindey; 8 February 1910 – 22 April 1992) was a Hungarian-born film actress.

==Hungarian dancer==
Born in the Eastern name order in Budapest of Czech extraction and nicknamed Stefi (Stefánia) by her friends and family, Duna started dancing at the age of nine and first attracted attention as a thirteen-year-old ballet dancer in Europe. She made her first stage appearance in dramatized fairy tales at the Children&#x27;s Theater of Budapest. Initially opposed to the idea, her father sent her to the best schools in the Hungarian capital to learn dancing, and soon she had danced in most of the capitals of Europe.

In 1932, she appeared on the London stage in Noël Coward&#x27;s revue &quot;Words and Music&quot; as one of the four actresses to create the song &quot;Mad about the Boy&quot;.

==Film actress==

When she came to Hollywood in 1932, Duna could not speak a word of English. She made up her mind to learn quickly. Directors advised her to stay away from her Hungarian friends to speed up her learning. Within a few years, she could speak not only English but five other languages. 

During the 1930s, she played a variety of nationalities. However, despite her European background, she was often cast as fiery Latin &quot;femmes fatale&quot; in films that made full use of her exotic and glamorous persona, such as &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; (1934), the first live-action short film made in three-strip Technicolor.

She made her film debut in &quot;The Indiscretions of Eve&quot; (1932) in the starring role (along with Jessica Tandy, also making her debut). Signed by RKO Radio Pictures, she played Guninana, the Eskimo wife of Francis Lederer, in &quot;Man of Two Worlds&quot; (1934). Lederer had performed with Duna in the Berlin, Germany production of &quot;Die Wunderbar&quot;. 

In 1936, she played Nedda in the British film version of &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, starring Richard Tauber. Films in which she played lead roles, such as &quot;Panama Lady&quot; (1939) with Lucille Ball, were popular but did not make her a major star. Her best remembered films include &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936) and &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1940).

==Personal life and death==
Duna was married twice. Her first marriage was in 1935 to actor John Carroll, her co-star in the screen comedy &quot;Hi, Gaucho!&quot;. They had one child, a daughter, and divorced in 1938. 

On October 18, 1940, Duna married actor Dennis O&#x27;Keefe in Phoenix, Arizona. They had a son.

Duna died on 22 April 1992 (aged 82) of cancer at her home in Beverly Hills.

<doc id="1148964" wikidata="Q5531021" url="?curid=1148964" title="Gender transposition">
<text>Gender transposition is a term in linguistics to describe the substitution of a gendered personal pronoun for the other gendered form. When used to describe a woman, this would be using the pronouns &quot;his&quot; or &quot;him&quot; instead of &quot;her&quot;, and &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;she&quot;. For men, it would be the reverse.

Often used in the argot of gay men, it can be intended either as a put-down, a self-mocking appellation, a term of endearment, or neutrally. It may be considered gay bashing or homophobic when used by heterosexual people to mock a gay person.

<text>The TV Boy, and its successors TV Boy II and Super TV Boy, are handheld TV games sold by many different companies, including Systema, Akor, and NICS, based upon an unlicensed clone of Atari 2600 hardware. They were released around 1992 and three years later, an improved version of the TV Boy 2, the Super TV Boy, was also made by Akor. They were widely available across Europe. In the UK, they were most visibly available through Argos.

Users can play any one of 127 built-in games. In the UK, they were marketed with 126 games included, while the Super TV Boy has 127.

==Hardware==
Resembling a large handheld pad, the systems plug into a TV and operate on either four AA batteries or a 6V power supply (centre negative). The only difference between a TV Boy and TV Boy II is that the former has two 9-pin Atari-type joystick connectors for the optional use of external joysticks. This is true for the Systema and NICS TV Boys, but not for the Akor version, which does not have such external ports at all. As the TV Boy II has no capacity for external joysticks, only a single player may play using a built-in pad. Some versions of the TV Boy, but not all, have a jumper labeled NTSC/PAL on its motherboard. There is no cartridge slot for additional games.

==Games==
The system contains a single 512KB ROM, housing 128 programs. One is the program that enables the others to be selected so only 127 games are included. None of them use any sort of paged ROM scheme.

All 127 are original Atari 2600 games by companies such as Atari, Activision, and Mattel, hacked to remove copyright notices and other assets demonstrating ownership. The colored bars to the left of the &quot;A&quot; in the Activision logo remain in some games but the company name is excised. False and ambiguous names – such as &quot;Mad Kong&quot; (&quot;Donkey Kong&quot;) and &quot;The Flying Man&quot; (&quot;Superman&quot;) – are printed on the packing box and in the instruction manual.

For the UK versions, one game originally included with the TV Boy was removed from the TV Boy II: game #91: &quot;Protection&quot; (&quot;Defender&quot;). No replacement game takes its place (it was left non-operational) making the TV Boy II a 126-game handheld console. This space was filled in the Super TV Boy with &quot;Winter Adventure&quot; (&quot;Mountain Man&quot;). Also, three games were exchanged in the UK: &quot;Maze Town&quot; (&quot;Maze Craze&quot;) with &quot;Full Attack&quot;, &quot;Football&quot; (&quot;Pele&#x27;s Soccer&quot;) with &quot;Besieged&quot; (&quot;Z-Tack&quot;), and &quot;Duel&quot; (&quot;Outlaw&quot;) with &quot;Laser Attack&quot; (&quot;Laser Blast&quot;).

Some of the games slightly alter the graphics of the originals. All play with altered colors — for example, &quot;Pitfall!&quot; (retitled as &quot;Forest Walk&quot;) is set in a blue forest — because the game ROMs are NTSC versions played on a PAL console.

<text>Tilos a Bemenet (&quot;No Entry&quot;) was the first operetta by Jenő Huszka. It premiered 2 September 1899 at the Magyar theatre in Budapest, Hungary but was not a success, mainly due to the poor libretto (written by Adolf Mérei).

<text>Song Hye-kyo (; born November 22, 1981) is a South Korean actress. She gained international popularity through her leading roles in the television dramas &quot;Autumn in My Heart&quot; (2000), &quot;All In&quot; (2003), &quot;Full House&quot; (2004), &quot;That Winter, the Wind Blows&quot; (2013), &quot;Descendants of the Sun&quot; (2016), &quot;Encounter&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Glory&quot; (2022). Her film work includes &quot;Hwang Jin Yi&quot; (2007), &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; (2013), &quot;My Brilliant Life&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Queens&quot; (2015).

In 2017, Song ranked 7th in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s Korea Power Celebrity 40 list, and 6th in 2018. She is referred to as one of &quot;The Troika,&quot; along with Kim Tae-hee and Jun Ji-hyun, collectively known by the acronym &quot;Tae-Hye-Ji&quot;. The success of Song&#x27;s television dramas internationally established her as a top Hallyu star.

==Early life and education==
When Song was born, she was so ill that her parents and doctors did not think that she would survive. Upon her recovery, Song&#x27;s parents registered her birth on February 26, 1982 (instead of her actual birthdate, November 22, 1981).

Song&#x27;s parents divorced when she was a young girl, after which she was raised by her mother. They moved from her birthplace in Daegu to the Gangnam District in Seoul, where she trained as a figure skater in elementary school but quit when she was in the eighth grade. Song considered herself shy and introverted, but when she attended Ewha Girls&#x27; High School she was described by her high school teacher as having a &quot;cheerful character, she mixed well with her friends and was always in a bright mood.&quot; Song Hye-kyo attended Sejong University, where she majored in Film Arts.

==Career==
===1996–2004: Debut, breakthrough, and international fame===
In 1996, the fourteen-year-old Song, then a third-year junior high school student, won first place in the SunKyung Smart Model Contest, and made her entertainment debut as a model for the school uniform company. This led to her being cast in a small role in her first television drama, &quot;First Love&quot;. She would continue to appear in a string of dramas and sitcoms, most notably &quot;Soonpoong Clinic&quot;. But it was not until the KBS drama &quot;Autumn in My Heart&quot; in 2000 with Song Seung-heon and Won Bin that she rose to fame in Korea and throughout Asia. The romantic melodrama series was a ratings success, pioneering a trend in Korean melodramatic series and launching a trend that is commonly referred to as the &quot;Korean Wave&quot; and leading to Song becoming a Hallyu star.

In 2003, her popularity continued to climb as she played a leading role alongside Lee Byung-hun in the gambling drama &quot;All In&quot;, which drew solid viewership ratings nationwide throughout its run with a peak viewer rating of 47.7 percent. The following year, she co-starred with singer Rain in the hit romantic comedy series &quot;Full House&quot;. The drama achieved pan-Asian success and established Song as one of the best-known Korean actresses in Asia.

===2005–2012: Film debut and overseas ventures===
Early 2005, Song went to San Francisco to study English, and later traveled to Seattle. She took time off to recharge herself after the successful Asia drama &quot;Full House&quot;. &quot;I have had a good rest. It was a good opportunity to reflect on myself,&quot; said Song. Song returned to Korea on March 5, 2005. The same year, Song made her big-screen debut in &quot;My Girl and I&quot; (a Korean remake of &quot;Crying Out Love in the Center of the World&quot;), which was panned by audiences and critics alike. Vocal about her dissatisfaction with typecasting in the roles she was being offered, Song proved in the following year that she could play different roles.

She returned to the big screen in 2007 as the titular gisaeng in the film adaptation of &quot;Hwang Jin Yi&quot;. Because they found Song&#x27;s image &quot;too cute,&quot; Jun Ji-hyun and Soo Ae were the producers&#x27; original choices for the role, but Song went on a rigorous diet and surprised them with her will and desire to be Hwang Jini. A year later, she made her American debut in the Hollywood indie &quot;Make Yourself at Home&quot; (formerly titled &quot;Fetish&quot;), a psychological thriller about a girl who was born to a shaman mother and tries to flee her fate by becoming an immigrant bride in the US. Despite Song&#x27;s attempts to challenge herself, both films underwhelmed the box office.

She made her TV comeback in late 2008 with &quot;The World That They Live In&quot; (also known as &quot;Worlds Within&quot;), a series set at a broadcast station in which Song and Hyun Bin played drama PDs who work together and fall in love.

In 2010, she starred in &quot;Camellia&quot;, an omnibus film made up of three short films directed by three Asian directors. Each episode is set in the past, present, and future of the city of Busan. In the film&#x27;s final segment, &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, Song and Kang Dong-won played former lovers who forget their memories about each other, which later leads them to a fatal destiny.

Considered one of Korea&#x27;s most beautiful women, in early 2011 Song released the photo-book &quot;Song Hye-kyo&#x27;s Moment,&quot; which was shot by top photographers in Atlanta, New York City, Buenos Aires, Patagonia, Paris, the Netherlands and Brazil. Proceeds from the sales of the photo book was donated to a children&#x27;s foundation.

Song next played a documentary filmmaker who finds the strength to forgive the seventeen-year-old boy who killed her fiancé but instead of redemption finds only greater tragedy in &quot;A Reason to Live&quot; (Korean title: &quot;Today&quot;), which after several delays was released in October 2011. Song was a huge fan of director Lee Jeong-hyang and had actively sought her out, and though she had difficulty getting into character, Song said she fell in love with the script and felt her acting had matured. She considers the film &quot;a turning point&quot; in her life.

In 2011, she became the first Asian actress to sign a contract with French global agency Effigies, paving the way for her possible entry into the European market. She released a photo-essay book in 2012 titled &quot;It&#x27;s Time for Hye-kyo&quot;.

Song next played a supporting role in &quot;The Grandmaster&quot;, Chinese director Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s biographical film about Bruce Lee&#x27;s kung fu master Ip Man, for which she learned Cantonese and martial arts. She later admitted there had been &quot;a bit of friction and misunderstanding&quot; with Wong while filming, but that the difficulties helped her mature.

===2013–present: Career resurgence===
Song reunited with the writer and director of &quot;Worlds Within&quot; in &quot;That Winter, the Wind Blows&quot;, a 2013 remake of 2002 Japanese drama &quot;Ai Nante Irane Yo, Natsu&quot; (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Love, Summer&quot;). She played a blind heiress in the melodrama, opposite a con man pretending to be her long-lost brother (played by Jo In-sung). &quot;That Winter, the Wind Blows&quot; placed number one in its time slot during most of its run, and Song and Jo were praised for their performances. Song won the Daesang (or &quot;Grand Prize&quot;), the highest award for television, at the 2nd APAN Star Awards.

In 2014, Song reunited with Kang Dong-won in &quot;My Brilliant Life&quot;, E J-yong&#x27;s film adaptation of Kim Aeran&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;My Palpitating Life&quot; about a couple who watched their son suffering from progeria grow prematurely old.

The romantic epic &quot;The Crossing&quot; was Song&#x27;s second Chinese film to be released. It was directed by John Woo (Woo&#x27;s longtime friend and producer Terence Chang has been managing Song&#x27;s overseas activities since 2008). Previously titled &quot;1949&quot; and &quot;Love and Let Love&quot;, the long-gestating project had originally been announced at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008, then cancelled in 2009, and revived again in 2011. Woo&#x27;s recovery from tonsil tumor removal in 2012 led to another delay due to scheduling conflicts among the cast, and Song finally began filming in June 2013. &quot;The Crossing&quot; is based on the true story of the &quot;Taiping&quot; steamer collision. It follows six characters&#x27; intertwining love stories in Taiwan and Shanghai during the 1930s. Song played the daughter of a wealthy banker.

Another Chinese film followed in 2015, &quot;The Queens&quot;, a contemporary romantic comedy about three cosmopolitan women – an actress, a PR specialist, and a gallery manager – who manipulate friends and put down their enemies as they play the game of love. Also starring Joe Chen and Vivian Wu, it was actress Annie Yi&#x27;s directorial debut.

In 2016, Song starred in the mega-hit romantic comedy series &quot;Descendants of the Sun&quot;, an intense drama about an army captain (played by Song Joong-ki) and a surgeon who fall in love while working in disaster-torn areas. The drama was incredibly popular in Korea with a peak viewership rating of 41.6% and in Asia, where it was viewed 2.5 billion times on iQiyi. The popularity of the drama reestablished Song as a leader of the Hallyu. She topped popularity polls in Asia and was noted for her immense brand recognition in South Korea. Song won Daesang (Grand Prize), the highest award at the 2016 KBS Drama Awards along with her co-star, Song Joong-ki.

After a two-year hiatus, she returned in the small screen with romantic-melodrama &quot;Encounter&quot; alongside Park Bo-gum. In 2021, Song starred in SBS romantic drama &quot;Now, We Are Breaking Up&quot;, playing a team leader of design department of a fashion company.

In 2022, Song reunited with &quot;Descendants of the Sun&quot; writer Kim Eun-sook in the Netflix series &quot;The Glory&quot;. The series was well received by the audience and Song&#x27;s portrayal of Moon Dong-eun, a victim of brutal high school bullying who dedicates her adulthood to plot revenge against perpetrators, was met with praise by the critics. For her performance in the series, Song won Best Actress – Television at the 59th Baeksang Arts Awards.

==Personal life==

On July 5, 2017, Song and &quot;Descendants of the Sun&quot; co-star Song Joong-ki announced through their respective agencies that they were engaged. They married in a private ceremony on October 31, 2017, at Youngbingwan, Hotel Shilla in Seoul, amid intense media interest across Asia. The ceremony was attended by the couple&#x27;s closest family and friends, including actors Lee Kwang-soo, Yoo Ah-in, and Park Bo-gum, who also played the piano at the reception.

On June 27, 2019, Song Joong-ki revealed that he had filed for divorce with Song Hye-kyo the previous day. The divorce was finalised in July 2019.

On July 25, 2019, Song Hye-kyo filed a complaint against fifteen online netizens for &quot;spread of false information, defamation of character and insult.&quot;

===Legal issues===
In August 2014, following inadvertent exposure by a politician overseeing the administration of the National Tax Service of South Korea, Song made a public apology for committing tax evasion when she claimed undocumented expenses. In response to allegations that she had underpaid income tax from 2009 to 2011 totaling , she argued that her accountant had mishandled her paperwork without her knowledge. After receiving notification from the NTS in October 2012, Song paid the tax balance due plus understatement of income tax penalties in the aggregate of ().

<doc id="1148978" wikidata="Q721181" url="?curid=1148978" title="German chocolate cake">
<text>German chocolate cake, originally German&#x27;s chocolate cake, is a layered chocolate cake filled and topped with a coconut-pecan frosting. Originating in the United States, it was named after English-American chocolate maker Samuel German, who developed a formulation of dark baking chocolate that came to be used in the cake recipe. Sweet baking chocolate is traditionally used for the cake&#x27;s flavor, but few recipes call for it today. The filling and/or topping is a custard made with egg yolks and evaporated milk; once the custard is cooked, coconut and pecans are stirred in. Occasionally, a chocolate frosting is spread on the sides of the cake and piped around the circumference of the layers to hold in the filling. Maraschino cherries are occasionally added as a garnish.

==History==
In 1957, a recipe for &quot;German&#x27;s Chocolate Cake&quot; appeared as the &quot;Recipe of the Day&quot; in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;. It was created by Mrs. George Clay, a homemaker from Dallas, Texas, and used the &quot;German&#x27;s Sweet Chocolate&quot; baking chocolate introduced over a century earlier in 1853 by American baker Samuel German for the Baker&#x27;s Chocolate Company of Boston, Massachusetts. A similar recipe by food conservationist Jackie Huffines had previously been featured on television.

General Foods, which owned the Baker&#x27;s brand at the time, took notice and distributed the cake recipe to other newspapers in the country. Sales of Baker&#x27;s Chocolate are said to have increased by as much as 73% and the cake became a national staple. The possessive form &quot;German&#x27;s&quot; was dropped in subsequent publications, forming the &quot;German Chocolate Cake&quot; identity and giving the false impression of a German origin.

==Hawaii==

Popular throughout Hawaii is the Chantilly cake, a modified German chocolate cake without coconut or nuts in its frosting, although it is occasionally topped with macadamia nuts. Otherwise, recipes between German chocolate cake and Chantilly cake are nearly identical. This frosting, also known as &quot;Chantilly,&quot; can also be applied on cream puffs.
Despite its name, it does not contain Chantilly cream.

<text>Prince Bob (&quot;Bob herceg&quot;) is an operetta in three acts by Jenő Huszka. The libretto was written by Ferenc Martos and Károly Bakonyi.

==Performance history==
The operetta premiered on 20 December 1902 at Népszínház in Budapest, Hungary and is considered to be Huszka&#x27;s first critical success.

==Synopsis==
The story concerns a young prince named George. However, he does not enjoy his princely duties and does not love the princess to whom he is betrothed, so he and his friend sneak out to London for some fun (&quot;Londonban, hej&quot;). He uses a pseudonym, Bob. In London, he meets the pretty Annie, a poor girl. She does not know that he is the prince in disguise. The story is about how George becomes king, and the romances between George and Annie and between his betrothed princess and a soldier.

==Films==

It was filmed by László Kalmár in 1941 and produced for TV in 1972.

<doc id="1148992" wikidata="Q7292702" url="?curid=1148992" title="Range fractionation">
<text>Range fractionation is a term used in biology to describe the way by which a group of sensory neurons are able to encode varying magnitudes of a stimulus. Sense organs are usually composed of many sensory receptors measuring the same property. These sensory receptors show a limited degree of precision due to an upper limit in firing rate. If the receptors are endowed with distinct transfer functions in such a way that the points of highest sensitivity are scattered along the axis of the quality being measured, the precision of the sense organ as a whole can be increased.

The basis of the idea of range fractionation is that each stimulus (for example, touch) has a range of intensities that can be sensed (light-touch to deep/hard-touch). For an organism to be able to sense a range of stimulus intensities, sensory neurons are tuned to fractions of the entire range. Collectively, the pattern of activity among the sensory neurons is how the organism can identify specific stimulus parameters. This was shown for proprioceptive neurons in the locust leg, proprioceptive neurons in the stick insect, Johnston&#x27;s Organ neurons in Drosophila, and in auditory-sensing neurons in crickets.

Range fraction is similar to the labeled line theory in that they both describe a phenomenon by which sensory neurons divide the task of encoding a range of stimulus intensities. However the difference lies within the downstream synaptic partners. Labeled line theory describes fully segregated channels postsynaptically. In contrast, sensory neurons that use range fractionation have common synaptic partners, and it is there collective activity that is informative of the stimulus type.

<doc id="1149009" wikidata="Q4204327" url="?curid=1149009" title="Toyota Sprinter">
<text>The is a compact car manufactured by Toyota as a variant of the Toyota Corolla. Exclusively sold in the Japanese domestic market, the Sprinter was aimed to be sportier than its Corolla sibling and also using different sheet metal mostly on the C-pillar. The Sprinter and various body styles were exclusive to &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; until 1977 when the Toyota Chaser took the top position. The Corolla is similarly unique to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; until the Toyota Celica was offered in 1970, which took the top position. In 1998 &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; and &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; were both replaced by &quot;Netz Store&quot;.

The Sprinter is notable for being used as the base vehicle for two joint projects between Toyota and General Motors in the United States, known under GM as the S-car. From 1984 to 1997, variants of the Sprinter were manufactured by NUMMI in Fremont, California, known as the Chevrolet Nova (1984–1988) and Geo Prizm (1988–1997).

Each generation of the Corolla had a corresponding Sprinter sibling, until the introduction of the E120-series Corolla in 2000. The Sprinter was indirectly replaced by a rebadged Corolla hatchback called Allex, which also sold at the &quot;Netz Store&quot; dealer network, and commercial Sprinter wagons were replaced by Probox.

== First generation (E10; 1968) ==
The first generation Sprinter was introduced in April 1968, thirteen months after the introduction of the regular first generation Corolla (E10). The car was marketed as a fastback coupé version of the Corolla and sold at Japanese dealership sales channel called &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot;. and Corolla was sold at a different dealership in Japan called &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;.

This was the only version to include the word &quot;Corolla&quot; in its name. Like the rest of the E10 Corolla range, the coupe was originally powered by a 1077 cc &quot;K&quot; engine, producing . The sporty SL trim was equipped with more powerful high compression dual carburetors &quot;K-B&quot; engine, producing . The engine was paired with either 4-speed manual (column or floor shift) or a 2-speed &quot;Toyoglide&quot; automatic transmission. The sporty SL trim was only available with floor shift manual transmission.
In February 1969, minor facelift was introduced with new amber front turn signal, standard front 3-point seatbelt, headrest and interior improvement. Another improvement occurred in September 1969 with bigger 1166 cc 3K engine with output , while the SL trim was also upgraded with &quot;3K-B&quot; high compression dual carburetors engine, generating . This new model with bigger engine now bearing KE17 code.

The Corolla Sprinter was also sold in Europe and North America as a part of Corolla&#x27;s range.

==Second generation (E20; 1970) ==


In May 1970, the Sprinter was released as the sister car of the second generation Corolla coupé, as the coupé was no longer exclusive to Sprinter. Toyota had promised its &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; dealers in Japan that they would receive exclusive rights to sell the Corolla. In order to sell through the &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; dealer network, the Sprinter was no longer bearing Corolla nameplate, even though the differences were mostly cosmetic. The wagon/van version of Corolla (KE26/TE28V) was not available for the Sprinter.

The &quot;3K/3K-B&quot; engines were inherited from the previous generation, with additional high compression single carburettor &quot;3K-D&quot; and low compression dual carburetors &quot;3K-BR&quot; engines. A 1407 cc &quot;T&quot; engine was added to the line up in September 1970, followed by more powerful &quot;T-B/BR/D&quot; engines for sporty SL/SR models which could be paired with new 5-speed manual transmission option in April 1971. The 4-door sedan version of Sprinter debuted in August 1971, together with the facelifted coupé. The coupé range received the 1588 cc, DOHC &quot;2T-G&quot; engine in March 1972; this model was known as the Sprinter Trueno, the twin of the Corolla Levin. Another facelift occurred in August 1972 and the 5-speed manual became available for the sporty SL/SR grades with 1.2 L &quot;3K-B/BR&quot; engine. The OHV dual carburetors version of &quot;2T-G&quot; engine called &quot;2T-B/BR&quot; was launched in April 1973 specially for SL, SR and cheaper model of Sprinter Trueno called the &quot;Sprinter Trueno J&quot;.

==Third generation (E40, E60; 1974) ==
1974 brought the third generation Sprinter based on the third generation E30 Corolla 2-door coupé and 4-door sedan. Once again, the differences between the Corolla and Sprinter were mostly cosmetic. The sedans received a more formal upright grill, while the coupé received a sleeker, aerodynamic looking frontal treatment.

The Corolla&#x27;s were given E30–38 codes while the Sprinter&#x27;s were given corresponding E41–47 codes, making it the only generation that did not bear same chassis codes as Corolla. A three-door shooting brake style liftback with the coupé&#x27;s front end was added to the line up in January 1976. When the Corolla range received a minor update in January 1977 to become the E50–55 series, the Sprinter received a corresponding update to become the E60–66 series, along with a hardtop coupé variant which used the sedan&#x27;s frond end. In April 1978, the Sprinter received its second facelift to counter the new competitor introduced by Nissan called the Pulsar which was introduced a month earlier.

== Fourth generation (E70; 1979) ==
The 1979 fourth generation Sprinter was based on the fourth generation Corolla coupé, 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and 3-door liftback, without the 2-door sedan and wagon/van variants again. As before, the differences were cosmetic — the Corollas had a simpler treatment of the grill, head lights and tail lights while the Sprinter used a slightly more complex, sculpted treatment. The 1.4 &quot;T&quot; engine was replaced by a bigger 1.5 L &quot;3A-U&quot;, and a 1.6 L fuel injected &quot;2T-GEU&quot; engine became available for every body styles as GT variants (except the coupé, badged as &quot;Trueno&quot;). In August 1979, a 1.8 L &quot;13T-U&quot; petrol engine was introduced. 

The Sprinter received a facelift with a wedge-shaped nose in August 1981. The obsolete 2-speed automatic transmission for 1.3 L &quot;4K-U&quot; engine was replaced by a 3-speed unit and also the 1.8 L &quot;13T-U&quot; engine was discontinued due to poor sales. In February 1982, the 1.8 L engine was reintroduced for sedan only, but as diesel engine called &quot;1C&quot;, which was the first diesel engine for the Sprinter/Corolla range and could be paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission option.

== Fifth generation (E80; 1983) ==

The fifth generation Sprinter was based on the 1983 fifth generation E80 Corolla range. Like the Corolla, the model line was split into FWD and RWD models.

Unlike the 5-door liftback which had minimum exterior differences, the E80 Sprinter sedan was designed with different sheet metal on the rear part. It got two additional windows on the C-pillars and different tail lamps which was placed a little higher due the higher trunk position. The 3/5-door &quot;FX&quot; hatchbacks were not available for Sprinter. From this generation forward, the 2-door coupé and 3-door liftback body styles were now exclusive to the Sprinter Trueno/Corolla Levin range.

In October 1984, a high performance GT model was added to the line up and only available as sedan. It was powered by a 1.6 L DOHC 16-valve &quot;4A-GELU&quot; engine, the same engine that was similar to the 1.6 L &quot;4A-GEU&quot; engine that powered the popular AE86 Sprinter Trueno/Corolla Levin. Minor facelifts occurred with new exterior styling in May 1985. The 1.3 L &quot;2A-LU&quot; and 1.6 L &quot;4A-ELU&quot; engines were also discontinued, with the former being replaced by the 12-valve 1.3 L &quot;2E-LU&quot; engine.

The four-door sedan and the five-door liftback were also manufactured in Fremont, California and sold for the North American market under the resurrected name of Chevrolet Nova, the first of several Toyotas built by General Motors known as their S-platform under license at NUMMI.

== Sixth generation (E90; 1987) ==
The sixth generation Sprinter was shared with the sixth generation E90 Corolla range, introduced in May 1987. The E90 series was the first generation with Full-time 4WD option. The Sprinter was offered as a 6-window sedan as before, 5-door liftback called Sprinter Cielo (Cielo means celestial or heavenly in Spanish; it was exported as the Corolla liftback) and a rebadged Corolla commercial van. The van was the first in the Sprinter history, although the Corolla also gained a passenger oriented wagon version as well. The Sprinter got more upmarket four-wheel drive wagon version called Sprinter Carib and exported as Corolla 4WD wagon.

Like the older E80 series-based Chevrolet Nova, the E90 series was also used as the basis of North American market Sprinter-based sedan and liftback with slightly different front end called the Geo Prizm.

The E90 sedan and &quot;Cielo&quot; liftback were introduced first in May 1987, with three petrol engine options; carburetted 1.3 L &quot;2E&quot;, 1.5 L &quot;5A-F&quot; and high performance fuel injected 1.6 L &quot;red &amp; black top&quot; &quot;4A-GE&quot;. A full-time AWD version of the sedan, powered by a 1.6 L &quot;4A-F&quot; engine (AE95) was introduced later in October. Another Sprinter range was added to the line up in August 1988, with the additional commercial van model. This model had exclusive 1.5 L &quot;3E&quot; petrol engine and 1.8 L &quot;1C-II&quot; diesel engine as option.

The facelift arrived for Sprinter sedan and liftback in May 1989. The sedan also received 1.5 L fuel injected &quot;5A-FE&quot; petrol engine from Cielo, &quot;4A-FE&quot; from Sprinter Carib for AWD models and also a revised 1.8 L &quot;1C-III&quot; diesel engines shared with the commercial van. The 1.6 L &quot;4A-GE&quot; engine was also replaced by the &quot;red top&quot; version, boosting the power from . Another engine options for sedan were introduced in August 1989, a new &quot;5A-FHE&quot; engine for top FWD models and a 2.0 L &quot;2C-III&quot; diesel engine for AWD models (CE95).

== Seventh generation (E100; 1991) ==
The seventh generation Sprinter was introduced in June 1991. Unlike the prior generation, the body shell was developed to employ pressed doors style than the regular doors on Corolla and also the deletion of the extra windows on the C-pillar. A 5-door liftback was also developed as the new Sprinter Cielo, but it was never available in Japan due the low sales of the previous generation. The liftback was later exported to Europe and Australia as Corolla liftback. The rebadged Corolla commercial van and business wagon were also available in September 1991, sold together with the older Sprinter Carib as Toyota developed another upmarket passenger wagon based on E100 platform called Corolla Touring Wagon.

Most of the engines were inherited from the E90 Sprinter, with additional new DOHC 16-valve 1.3 L &quot;4E-FE&quot; and 1.5 L &quot;5E-FE&quot; engines for certain models. The high performance GT trim received new 20-valve &quot;4A-GE&quot; &quot;silver top&quot; engine, generating at 7,400rpm. The 20-valve engine was ahead of its time when it was offered during this generation, coming with features like VVT, individual throttle bodies (ITB&#x27;s), a compression ratio of 10.8:1 and a five-valve-per-cylinder head design. This helped the cars equipped with it to accelerate from 0–100 km/h in approximately 6 seconds and reach a top speed of over 200 km/h. A five-valve-per-cylinder engine was unusual for the time, however Mitsubishi was the first to offer a five-valve-per-cylinder engine in the Minica Dangan ZZ-4 kei car in 1989.

The sedan gained its first improvement in September 1991 with additional side door beams, rear three-point seat belts and seat belt warnings which became standard for all trims. The full-time four-wheel drive system option was also added for models with 1.6 L &quot;4A-FE&quot; petrol and 2.0 L &quot;2C-III&quot; diesel engines. The facelift occurred for the sedan in May 1993 with the redesign of the front grille, bumper, and rear combination lamps and stayed without further improvement until its discontinuation in May 1995.

The van and business wagon were remained on sale as a compact segment commercial wagon, together with the upmarket passenger oriented E100 Corolla Touring Wagon and the newly introduced E110 Sprinter Carib. Both of commercial wagons received improvement with new DOHC 16-valve 1.3 L &quot;4E-FE&quot; and 1.5 L &quot;5E-FE&quot; engines, replacing the old SOHC units with the same displacement in April 1994. The driver&#x27;s airbag became standard for every trim and four-wheel drive model with 1.6 L &quot;4A-FE&quot; engine was added to commercial van in May 1996. The 2.0 L diesel engine was replaced by a bigger 2.2 L &quot;3C-E&quot; unit in April 1998. This new engine could be optioned with four-wheel drive system for the commercial van. The business wagon also received new standard safety pack such as front passenger airbag, ABS and seatbelts with pretensioner and force limiter. The 1998 safety pack update became standard for commercial van in August 2000 and the 4-speed manual transmission was upgraded to 5-speed unit. The wagons were discontinued in 2002 and succeeded by Probox.

This platform was also produced in the US as the last Sprinter-based Geo Prizm and only available as a sedan, as the liftback body style was discontinued in the North American market. Toyota 
also introduced a 4-door hardtop sedan (with frameless door windows) based on E100 Sprinter/Corolla called the Sprinter Marino/Corolla Ceres.

== Eighth generation (E110; 1995) ==
The eighth and last generation Sprinter was introduced in May 1995 with particular consideration for the environment, increasing safety standard and total production cost due the Lost Decades recession that was happening in Japan at the time. Because of this, the E110 Sprinter kept many of the E100&#x27;s components as well as its platform, hardly changed its body dimensions and yet managed to reduce the weight for the early models. The rear quarter window on the C-pillars was also revived, ostensibly to impart the Sprinter with a &quot;sporty and youthful image&quot;.

The E110 Sprinter became the basis of third generation Sprinter Carib, which was also exported to Europe with different face as Corolla wagon. The E100 Sprinter wagons continued for sale as commercial vehicles.

In May 1996, the dual airbags and ABS safety package became standard for ever trim level. Eleven months later, the sedan received its facelift and adopting the GOA (Global Outstanding Assessment) body structure technology. The GT trim was also revived with extra power than the older AE101 GT and paired with 6-speed manual transmission. The last major update of Sprinter was announced in April 1998, the 2.0 &quot;2C-III&quot; diesel engine was replaced by a bigger 2.2 L &quot;3C-E&quot; unit and also new 5-speed manual option for 1.3 &quot;4E-FE&quot; engine.

The Sprinter sedan sales was axed in December 2000 in favor of a twin of the E120 Corolla RunX hatchback called the Allex. The older E100 Sprinter commercial wagons continued on until July 2002.

== Nameplate usage for other models ==
The Sprinter name was used as a sportier specification of the Corolla sedan in South Africa from E30 until E80 generation. The nameplate was later reused in 2006 (E110), 2010 (E140) and 2014 (E180).

In Germany, the early E20 coupe was marketed as the Corolla 1200 Sprinter.

Australian market AE86 liftback was sold as Sprinter, while the rest of the world received the same car as Corolla GT, GT-S or SR-5. This Sprinter was a hybrid of European market Corolla GT face and Japanese market Sprinter Trueno rear.

European market E100 Corolla liftback was sold in Australia as Corolla Sprinter from 1994 to 1996.

<text>The Shuttle, formerly known as the &quot;Kidderminster Shuttle&quot;, is a free weekly newspaper distributed to households in the Wyre Forest area of Worcestershire, England, on a Thursday. In the Stourport area it was known as the &quot;Stourport News&quot;, and there was also a paid-for edition, the &quot;Kidderminster Times&quot;; all three papers have had identical editorial content since 2005 although each had its own masthead front page until April 2006. Since then all three papers have been renamed as &quot;The Shuttle&quot; incorporating the &quot;Kidderminster Shuttle&quot;, the &quot;Kidderminster Times&quot; and the &quot;Stourport News&quot;. The local office in Stourport was closed at the same time.

The paper remains a local institution in the Kidderminster area, notably with its in-depth coverage of local politics and Kidderminster Harriers F.C.

The &quot;Shuttle&quot; was first published in the 19th century, and takes its name from the carpet industry for which Kidderminster is famous.

The current editor of the &quot;Shuttle&quot; is Stephanie Preece.

The newspaper is owned by Newsquest Media Group which was acquired by the Gannett corporation in 1999. The Newsquest head office is based in Weybridge, Surrey and employs a total of more than 9,100 people across the UK.

== History ==
In 1900, the newspaper was purchased by Alfred Iliffe, who changed its name to The Worcester Daily and Weekly Times. Iliffe also acquired several other newspapers in the area and merged them into the Worcester group. In 1921, the newspaper was renamed The Worcester Evening News and continued to be published daily.

Throughout its history, The Shuttle was known for its coverage of local news and events in Worcester and the surrounding areas. It also covered national and international news, as well as sports, entertainment, and other topics. The newspaper was particularly influential during the First and Second World Wars, when it provided extensive coverage of the conflicts and supported the war effort. It also played a role in promoting social and political reform, such as women&#x27;s suffrage and labor rights.

In 2009, the newspaper carried advertisements on both its online and print editions from the British National Party, resulting in a letter of complaint by a member of the National Union of Journalists.

<doc id="1149039" wikidata="Q5358034" url="?curid=1149039" title="Electrohome">
<text>Founded in 1907, Electrohome was Canada&#x27;s largest manufacturer of television sets (TVs) from 1949 to 1987. The company was also involved in television broadcasting, and was a leader in data, video, graphics displays and projectors.

From 1984 to 1999, Electrohome-branded TVs were produced under licence by Mitsubishi Electric, and from 1999 to 2007 by Jutan (distributed by Canadian distributor Citizen Electronics).

The company underwent an orderly wind-up in late 2008. In February 2010, the Electrohome brand was acquired by Bluetronics Group a division of Circus World Displays Limited (CWD).

==History==

In 1907, Arthur Bell Pollock founded Pollock Manufacturing Co. Ltd., after winning a coin flip with his wife. The Kitchener, Ontario company manufactured the first phonographs in Canada. In the 1920s and 30s the company branched out into other consumer goods such as records, radios, furniture, and was the largest Canadian maker of electric fans. In 1933 the company name became Dominion Electrohome Industries Ltd. and the Electrohome brand was introduced for products ranging from heaters to food mixers.

With the outbreak of World War II, however, everything changed. Electrohome devoted 99% of its production to the war effort. It manufactured wooden aircraft elements including wings, munitions components, and communications equipment, including a radio transmitter for the Royal Canadian Air Force. After the war, Electrohome ranked as a nationally known and important company with 1,400 employees geared to meet the demands of the post-war economy. The war enabled the company to acquire new equipment, more production capacity and a wider range of skills. There was also a perception that Electrohome could be a major player on the Canadian national electronics scene.

The company began manufacturing and selling television sets in 1949, competing with companies such as Northern Electric and Canadian General Electric for a share of the Canadian market. Electrohome developed its reputation with large console model TV sets made with real hardwood cases.

In 1954, Carl Arthur Pollock, son of the company&#x27;s founder, led Electrohome in joining the Famous Players theatre chain to launch Kitchener-Waterloo&#x27;s first television station, CKCO-TV, as a CBC Television affiliate. It joined CTV in 1964. Electrohome assumed full control of CKCO in 1970 when broadcasting laws substantially reduced the amount of foreign ownership in Canadian media (Famous Players was controlled by Paramount Pictures).

In the 1960s, Electrohome continued to manufacture consumer products including organs, radios, console stereos, speakers, high fidelity tube amplifiers, and televisions, as it became the first Canadian company to make colour television sets. By 1965, Electrohome products were being sold in 23 countries. Total sales in 1968 were $44.5 million. Over the years the company had ten manufacturing plants and two administrative offices in the Kitchener-Waterloo area.

In 1972, John A. Pollock, grandson of the company founder, became the third generation president of Electrohome. By this time Electrohome was widely known as the Canadian equivalent of US companies like General Electric or RCA. Pollock led the company into a number of different electronics ventures and products, both consumer and industrial. Electrohome&#x27;s most successful products during this period were a line of display projectors that evolved from single CRT monochrome data projectors into stereoscopic virtual reality projectors and digital movie theater projectors, based on the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing technology.

In 1984, suffering from years of competition with Sony and other Japanese television makers, Electrohome ceased production of TV sets, and licensed the brand name to Mitsubishi Electric. In 1988, Electrohome purchased a second television station, CFRN-TV in Edmonton.

In 1995, Electrohome and Baton Broadcasting entered a partnership, sharing ownership of CKCO, CFRN, CFCN-TV in Calgary, CFPL-TV in London, CHWI-TV in Wheatley and CKNX-TV in Wingham. The following year, the partnership was reorganized: Baton took over full ownership of all of the stations – and with it, controlling interest in CTV. In return, Electrohome received cash and shares in Baton worth $270 Million Canadian, which changed its name to CTV Inc. a year later. Since 2002 CTV has been the top rated Canadian TV network.

In 1999, Electrohome sold the projection systems division to Christie Digital, a leading film projector manufacturer.

In 1999, Electrohome switched licensees, dropping Mitsubishi Electric and allowing Canadian distributor Citizen Electronics (Jutan) to market TVs and DVD players under the Electrohome brand name.

On March 5, 2007, the Redmond Group of Companies announced the purchase of Electrohome brands effective January 1, 2008. Later that month, on March 27, Synnex announced the purchase of the Redmond Group Electrohome assets.

In January 2008, Electrohome announced the sale of all of its trademarks to Synnex Corporation. Electrohome now derived most of its income from its licensing, minor stock holdings in Mechdyne/Fakespace Systems which provides visualization solutions for data analysis, and owns digital cinema firm Immersion Studios.

The company began an orderly wind-up in late 2008. In February 2010, the Electrohome brand was acquired by Bluetronics Group, a division of Circus World Displays Limited (CWD). Also included in the purchase were the rights to Magnasonic, Secureguard and Citizen (Canada only) brands, amongst many others. Based in Niagara Falls, Canada, CWD also owns and operates other brands including Fluance, Nyrius, Levana, SVAT, Defender and Pure Therapy.

==Plant 4==

Electrohome Plant 4 was located at 152 Shanley Street in Kitchener. Built in 1898, it was originally a factory for the Diamond (or L. C. Klippert) Furniture Company, run by industrialist Leander Klippert. The company only lasted until 1902, and the factory sat vacant until 1905, when it became occupied by the Walker Bin and Store Fixture Company. Walker&#x27;s was run by William McCuaig until 1912, then Oliver Kinzie. The company produced a variety of retail store furniture such as store counters, wall bins, floor racks, and display units. In 1928, Walker&#x27;s was taken over by a larger American furniture concern, Jones Brothers, which operated the factory until 1931 when production ended due to the Great Depression.

The building was yet again disused until 1934, when brothers J. Hogarth and J. North Kennedy operated a fine bedroom and dining room furniture manufacturing company, Kennedy&#x27;s, out of the building. However, the company was short-lived, and the building was once again vacant from 1935 to mid-1937, when it was taken over by Murawsky&#x27;s Furniture.

Martin Murawsky was a Polish immigrant who had arrived in Kitchener as a child in 1876. With his sons, he had operated his own company, Murawsky&#x27;s Furniture, out of a plant at 152 Victoria Street, near Park Street. They would operate the Shanley Street plant for sixteen years, until Murawsky&#x27;s, by then run by Martin&#x27;s sons, decided to focus on chair manufacturing and pivot toward the rapidly growing retail industry. As a result, they sold the Shanley Street plant to Dominion Electrohome.

Electrohome initially used the plant to manufacture its Deilcraft brand of furniture, but by the mid-1950s was also using it for lighting and heating appliance manufacturing, as well as storage. The company sold the building in 1968 to Morval Durofoam Products. Morval occupied the site until around 1980, where it manufactured plastic and foam products for auto interiors, as well as specialty packaging products. After this, the plant was sold to its final major occupant, Art Rite Advertising, which used the site until 1991.

In the years afterward, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment became aware that the property was heavily contaminated with various metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and trichloroethylene (TCE), a toxic industrial solvent. This would prove to be the century-old factory&#x27;s undoing. For the next few decades, parties ranging from local residents to various government bodies worked toward environmental remediation of the site and the possibility of redevelopment, with or without the original factory structure. In 2007, the Ministry of the Environment issued a cleanup order, but the property&#x27;s owner, an absentee numbered company, failed to do so, to undertake basic property maintenance, or even to pay municipal property taxes. In 2011, the City of Kitchener attempted a tax sale of the property after visible deterioration of the brick facade was observed. This was unsuccessful, and followed in 2018 by a second attempt, with the price being dropped to around $450,000. By 2019, the city had written off much of the back taxes owed for the property, and issued an order to have an engineer evaluate whether the factory building was still structurally sound. In late 2019, the property was purchased by a Toronto-based developer, which announced plans to demolish the plant and build a mixed-use development on the site, which would incorporate aspects of the original structure. Demolition began in January 2020.

<doc id="1149050" wikidata="Q941354" url="?curid=1149050" title="Sunset Riders">
<text>is a side-scrolling run and gun video game developed and released by Konami as an arcade video game in 1991. It is set in the American Old West, where the player(s) take control of bounty hunters who are seeking the rewards offered for various criminals.

The coin-op version was released in two variants: a two-player version and a four-player version. Home console versions of &quot;Sunset Riders&quot; were released for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1992 and for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993, to a positive reception. The arcade version was rereleased in 2010, as part of Game Pack 012 of Game Room for Xbox 360, and another emulated version of the arcade original was released by Hamster Corporation for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch as part of the company&#x27;s Arcade Archives series.

==Gameplay==
The game, which is set in a fanciful version of the American Old West, revolves around four bounty hunters named Steve, Billy Cool, Bob, and Cormano Wild, who are out to claim rewards offered for eliminating the most wanted outlaws in the West. At the beginning of each stage, the players are shown a wanted poster for the outlaw they will face at its end.

&quot;Sunset Riders&quot; has gameplay that is similar to both &quot;Contra&quot; and &quot;Vendetta&quot;. This cooperative shooter can also be played up to two or four players simultaneously, depending on the version of the game. In the two-player version each player can choose which of the four bounty hunters to play as at the start of the game, while in the four-player version each character is assigned to a different control panel. Steve and Billy wield revolvers, Bob carries a rifle, and Cormano uses a double barrel shotgun. The controls consist of an eight-way joystick for moving and aiming, and two buttons for shooting and jumping. The player(s) can jump between higher/lower floors and slide to avoid enemy attacks.

The objective of the game is to defeat a gang of outlaws in eight stages, with a fight against a strong boss character at the end of each. When two or more people are playing, the one who deals the most damage to a stage boss receives the entire bonus for defeating him. Five of the stages are played on foot, two on horseback, and one on a moving train. A bonus minigame is played after the second and fifth stages, in which the player(s) can earn additional points by shooting outlaws as they pop up. After all eight stages are cleared, the game restarts with increased difficulty.

Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering doorways, defeating certain sack-carrying bandits, or opening sacks placed on the ground. Two power-ups are available, a gold sheriff&#x27;s badge that grants fully automatic fire and a silver one that gives the player a second gun. Both power-ups can be equipped at once. Other weapons that can be used by the player include dynamite carried by female bandits (which must be thrown back before it explodes), hanging rocks/barrels/torches that can be dropped on enemies, and mounted Gatling guns available only in the last stage. An easter egg involves the defeat of the boss in the fifth stage; if Cormano is active at this point, he will catch the boss&#x27;s sombrero and wear it for the remainder of the game.

One life is lost whenever the player is hit by any enemy attack, trampled by bulls, caught in a fire or explosion, or struck by a rock or obstacle. Any power-ups that a player has gained are also lost. After all lives are lost, the player may continue the game by inserting more credits, but has a limited amount of time to do so before the game defaults to a game over screen.

===Characters===
There are four playable bounty hunters in the game who are out to claim rewards offered for eliminating the most wanted outlaws in the West:

Steve is a bounty hunter who also wields revolvers similar to Billy&#x27;s, though his bullets appear to be more powerful than Billy&#x27;s own bullets.

Billy is a bounty hunter who wields a revolver and speaks in a western country accent.

Bob is a bounty hunter who wields a rifle who speaks in a southern American accent.

Cormano is a bounty hunter who wears a Mexican poncho and a sombrero and wields a shotgun that fires a wide spread of bullets. He later wears a red sombrero worn by El Greco after he neutralizes him.

===Wanted Outlaws===
The outlaws are the recurring bosses of the game as Richard Rose is the final boss at the end of the game.

Simon Greedwell is a rich and greedy outlaw who is the boss of the first stage. He wields a shotgun while ordering his men to deal with the bounty hunters. His last words on death are &quot;Bury me with my money.&quot;

Hawkeye Hank Hatfield is a rich outlaw who is known to shoot a gun in one hand and the boss of the second stage. Despite his efforts to kill the bounty hunters, he was neutralized.

Dark Horse is a muscular outlaw who rides an armored horse. He is the boss of the third stage. Once he is neutralized by the bounty hunters, the armored horse runs away along with his corpse.

The Smith Brothers are siblings and outlaws who cause trouble inside a saloon owned by a beautiful woman. They are the bosses of the fourth stage, fought immediately after Dark Horse. After the bounty hunters neutralize the brothers, they watch the can-can performance of three beautiful women on stage, who then inform the bounty hunters about Richard Rose and his three henchmen.

El Greco is one of Richard Rose&#x27;s henchmen and a Mexican outlaw serving as the boss of the fifth stage. He carries a shield to deflect shots and a whip. Once he is neutralized by the bounty hunters, El Greco tosses away his red Mexican sombrero. If Cormano is being played, he will catch the hat and wear it in place of his own for the rest of the game.

Chief Scalpem, also known as Wigwam in the SNES version due to censorship issues, is a chief from the native American tribe, an expert in knife throwing and one of Richard Rose&#x27;s henchmen, serving as the boss of the sixth stage. Despite his efforts to defeat the bounty hunters, he was neutralized but was soon spared by the bounty hunters due to his younger sister&#x27;s plea knowing he was following Richard&#x27;s orders. In the Sega Genesis version, Scalpem serves as the boss of the third stage.

Paco Loco is a hulking outlaw who wields a gatling gun, and is one of Richard Rose&#x27;s henchmen, serving as the boss in the seventh stage. Once he is neutralized by the bounty hunters, his last words are &quot;Hasta la Bye Bye!&quot; referencing the T-800&#x27;s main catchphrase in the 1991 film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. In the Sega Genesis version, Paco Loco serves as the boss of the second stage.

Sir Richard Rose is a rich and elegant outlaw, and the main villain of the series, serving as the final boss of the game. He is an expert gunslinger, using his revolver in one hand, and demonstrating his agility at a fast pace. Upon his first &quot;death&quot; he reveals he is using a metal plate to cover his chest and avoid injury. After the second phase, he is finally neutralized by the bounty hunters, symbolized by a graphic showing a single rose being destroyed (not shown in the SNES version). In the Sega Genesis version, he serves as the boss in the fourth and final stage.

==Release==
In Japan, the arcade game was first published on July 9, 1991. &quot;Sunset Riders&quot; made its North American debut at the September 1991 Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in Las Vegas. It was then released for arcades internationally in October 1991. Two years later, the arcade version was reprogrammed to two home consoles. The home versions were only released in North America and Europe.

===Sega Genesis===
The Mega Drive/Genesis version of &quot;Sunset Riders&quot; features the most changes made to the game between the two home versions of the game. Out of the four main characters from the arcade game, only Billy and Cormano are featured. The two characters in the Genesis version were given surnames that they originally did not have in the arcade version (Billy Cool and Cormano Wild). The controls are identical to the arcade version aside from the addition of two shooting buttons instead of just one: one button allows the player to walk and shoot at the same time, while the other shoot button keeps the character still when pressed down, allowing the player to change their aim only.

Only four of the eight bosses from the arcade version are featured (Simon Greedwell, Paco Loco, Chief Scaplem, and Sir Richard Rose), and each of the four chapters are divided into two stages. Each boss dialogue is worded in a text bubble instead of voiced. The power-up icons have also been replaced as well. Unlike the other versions, the player can cause a dynamite stick to explode by shooting it. To access the bonus stages, the player must collect a Star-shaped item located in either stage of each chapter. The bonus stages also differ from the ones in the arcade version: the player chases after a moving wagon on horseback, while the woman in the wagon tosses bonus coins and extra lives at the player&#x27;s path.

In addition to the standard game mode, the Mega Drive/Genesis version features a two-player versus mode. The players must shoot each other until one of the players runs out of health.

===Super NES===
In contrast to the Genesis version, the SNES version of &quot;Sunset Riders&quot; features relatively few changes. Subtitles have been added to the voice acted cutscenes, and the barfly that kisses the player character in Stage 1 as well as the saloon dancers from Stage 4 are dressed more conservatively compared to the arcade version. In addition, there is only 1 woman you can rescue in Stage 4, and you do not get a bonus upon rescuing her. Hunter dogs, which were present in the first segment of the final chapter in the Genesis version, were removed. The Native American enemy characters from Stage 6 were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Wigwam as the stage boss. The dynamite-tossing female bandits were replaced with male bandits as well.

==Reception==
===Contemporary===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their December 15, 1991 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

&quot;Sunset Riders&quot; was well received by the video game press upon release. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; gave the arcade game an 82% score, opining it &quot;plays very well and should prove an interesting challenge for your finely honed arcade skills.&quot; In a more reserved review, &quot;Zero&quot; rated the arcade original a 3 out of 5, calling it a &quot;fairly fast shoot&#x27;em up with a sense of humour.&quot;

The &quot;rather splendid&quot; SNES version was given an overall score of 87% by Dan Jevons from &quot;Super Play&quot;, who described it as &quot;another winner from Konami&#x27;s stable&quot;. It also received an 89% score in &quot;SNES Force&quot;, with an 88% and an 89% from two reviewers. &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot; gave the scores of 86% to the SNES version and 78% for the Sega Mega Drive version, while &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; rated the latter as 84%, noting it as &quot;surprisingly good&quot;.

===Retrospective===
Retrospectively, Jamie O&#x27;Neill from &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; awarded the SNES version eight stars out of ten, writing it &quot;is bright, colourful, fantastically well animated, with superb music and sound. It understands its place as a Western game and within the run-and-gun genre, by combining imaginative characterisation and humour, with well-paced action set-pieces, plus variety in its gameplay.&quot; &quot;Retro Game Age&quot; gave it the same score as well, opining &quot;&quot;Sunset Riders&quot; remains a fun romp that still presents some challenge to get through and is just as fun to play now as it was almost 20 years ago.&quot; Nick Gibson from &quot;Sega-16&quot; rated the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis port a 7 out of 10, while it was rated 80% by &quot;Arcade Attack&quot;.

IGN ranked it as the 88th best game for the SNES. In 2018, Complex listed the game 36th in their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot;

<doc id="1149055" wikidata="Q4743815" url="?curid=1149055" title="American Football League draft">
<text>The American Football League draft, the American Football League (AFL, 1960–1969) stocked its teams in two ways:

# Signing free agents (players whose contracts in other professional football leagues had expired, or who had no professional experience).
# Signing players from the previous year&#x27;s college graduates.

The latter option involved a &quot;draft&quot; in which each team selected players who then were not available for other teams to select. The draft for the 1960 season was actually conducted in late 1959, shortly after the formation of the league. Thereafter, American Football League drafts were conducted separately from the rival NFL through 1966. Starting in 1967, after the NFL agreed to merge with the AFL, the two leagues conducted a &quot;&quot;common draft&quot;&quot;, which was in turn replaced with the modern NFL Draft in 1970, upon the completion of the AFL/NFL merger.

In 1961 and 1962, the American Football League drafts were &quot;regional&quot;. Teams were assigned broad geographical regions around their home city, and had &quot;rights&quot; to the players within those regions. The AFL&#x27;s owners reckoned that players would be more willing to play in their league if they had the opportunity to sign with their &quot;home town&quot; teams, and also hoped to attract fans with players with whom they had some familiarity. The AFL also tapped sources which the NFL had disdained: smaller colleges (non Division I-A) and all-black colleges.

During the years in which the American Football League was in direct competition with the NFL for players (and fans), numerous star players chose to play in the AFL. The first and one of the most prominent of these was LSU All-American Billy Cannon, who went on to become an AFL All-Star both as a running back with the Houston Oilers and as a tight end with the Oakland Raiders. Other greats signed by the AFL in the years &quot;before&quot; the common draft included Abner Haynes and Johnny Robinson (Dallas Texans); Jim Otto (Oakland Raiders); Lance Alworth, John Hadl, and Ron Mix (San Diego Chargers), Lionel Taylor (Denver Broncos); Billy Shaw (Buffalo Bills); Larry Grantham (New York Titans); Matt Snell and Joe Namath (New York Jets); Nick Buoniconti (Boston Patriots) and many others.
