<text>The Sister Fidelma mysteries are a series of historical mystery novels and short stories by Peter Tremayne (pseudonym of Peter Berresford Ellis) about a fictional detective who is the eponymous heroine of a series. Fidelma is both a &quot;dalaigh&quot; (an advocate in the courts of the Five Kingdoms of Éireann), and Celtic nun (Ellis uses the French term &quot;religieuse&quot;).

The Sister Fidelma stories are set in the middle to late 7th century, mainly in Ireland. They are historical whodunits in the literary tradition of Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, the Brother Cadfael mysteries by Ellis Peters, and the Judge Dee mysteries by Robert van Gulik (inspired by Gong&#x27;an fiction and by the official of the Chinese Tang Dynasty Di Renjie). Peter Tremayne&#x27;s novels usually feature the interaction of several subplots involving political intrigue, personal relationships, religious conflict, or characters&#x27; desires for personal or monetary gain.

Fidelma usually solves crimes in company with Brother Eadulf, a Saxon monk (Ellis uses the French term &quot;religieux&quot;). Though Eadulf has often been compared to Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s friend Dr. Watson, he is in fact more of an equal partner to Fidelma and usually proves essential to solving the mystery at hand (in fact, in the story of &quot;The Leper&#x27;s Bell&quot; he solves one of the main problems himself). A true companion, he has saved Fidelma&#x27;s life more than once.

==Main characters==
===Sister Fidelma===
Fidelma is usually described as attractive with &quot;a tall, yet a well-proportioned figure&quot; (described so in many of the short stories), with pale skin, red hair (strands of which have been known to &quot;rebelliously&quot; escape from under her hood or head-dress) and either green, grey-green or blue-green eyes (the short stories use these different descriptions). She was born into the royal family of Munster in the late 630s; her father, King Failbe Fland, died c. 637/9, during Fidelma&#x27;s infancy. Fidelma was raised as an Eoghanacht princess. She studied civil and criminal law, especially the Brehon laws, under the supervision of Brehon Morann of Tara. During her student years, Fidelma had an unhappy love affair with Cian, a warrior of the High King&#x27;s bodyguard, who eventually abandoned her to marry the daughter of the High King&#x27;s steward (who, ironically, later divorced him on the grounds that he was sterile). Her pre-occupation with Cian interfered with her concentration and devotion to her studies, and nearly caused her to be expelled from the Brehon Morann&#x27;s classes. Emerging from the affair battered but unbowed, she applied herself wholeheartedly to her studies and eventually qualified as an &quot;anruth&quot;, the second highest rank after an Ollamh in the Irish legal system. In the novels and short stories, she pursues a career as a &quot;dalaigh&quot; to the Brehon Court of Ireland.

In 659, while still studying at Brehon Morann&#x27;s law school, Fidelma traveled to visit Lúach, an old friend, but found upon her arrival that Lúach had been missing for five days. Fidelma undertook an investigation into her friend&#x27;s disappearance, but found more questions than answers, especially from those closest to Lúach (see the e-novella &quot;Lair of the White Fox&quot;).

After her studies were complete, on the advice of her mentor Abbot Laisran of Durrow Fidelma became a nun (referred to throughout the series as a &quot;religieuse&quot;), joining St. Brigid&#x27;s mixed abbey at Cill Dara (Kildare). She later left this community some time after her return from Rome for reasons outlined in the story &quot;Hemlock at Vespers&quot;, and now refers to herself as &quot;Fidelma of Cashel&quot; rather than &quot;Sister Fidelma&quot;. Strong-minded and independent, Fidelma often chafes at the structure of the religious life; she seems to have become a religieuse more as a career move (monasteries were the intellectual centers of seventh-century Ireland) than as an expression of Christian devotion; in the novel &quot;A Prayer for the Damned&quot;, Fidelma considers renouncing her religious vows but decides against it. Fidelma&#x27;s &quot;anam chara&quot; or &quot;soul friend&quot; (the Irish equivalent of a confessor and spiritual guide) had been her friend Liadin, as Fidelma had been to her, but Liadin later betrayed and broke her oath to Fidelma (see the short story &quot;At the Tent of Holofernes&quot; in the short story collection &quot;Hemlock at Vespers&quot;). Since that time Fidelma had no real &quot;anam chara&quot;, but in &quot;The Leper&#x27;s Bell&quot; she realized that she had unknowingly come to regard Eadulf as her &quot;anam chara&quot; and finally recognized him as such. Even so, she continued to seek advice from clerical mentors, particularly Abbot Laisran and Brother Conchobar of Cashel.

In 664, Fidelma accompanied the Irish delegation as an advisor on law to the Synod of Whitby, where she met Brother Eadulf (quite literally running into him); later, they were asked to work together to investigate the murder of Abbess Etain of Kildare, a leading member of the Church of Columba faction (see &quot;Absolution by Murder&quot;). Following a little initial hostility on Fidelma&#x27;s part towards Eadulf, the murderer was uncovered, and after the Synod concluded Fidelma and Eadulf journeyed together to Rome, where they were asked to investigate the murder of Archbishop-designate Wighard (see &quot;Shroud for the Archbishop&quot;). After the case was successfully resolved, Fidelma returned to Cashel, being forced on the way to stop at the seaport of Genua (Genoa), then traveling to the Abbey of Bobium (Bobbio Abbey) to visit her old teacher Brother Ruadán and becoming involved in the events of &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;.

In 665, Fidelma&#x27;s cousin King Cathal Cú-cen-máthair died of the Yellow Plague and Fidelma&#x27;s older brother Colgu succeeded to the throne of Muman (Munster) (the historical King Colgu ruled from A.D. 665–678), and in the wake of her brother&#x27;s succession Fidelma became involved in solving the murder of famed religious scholar the Venerable Dacan (see &quot;Suffer Little Children&quot;).

In 666 when Fidelma was called upon to investigate the finding of a headless body in an abbey well, she also became involved with the mystery of a deserted Gaulish ship on which (she learned) Eadulf had been traveling to Cashel as an emissary of Theodore of Tarsus, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and from which he and the entire crew had been taken captive (see &quot;The Subtle Serpent&quot;). Returning to Cashel together after rescuing Eadulf, revealing the murderer and uncovering a plot against Munster, Fidelma and Eadulf soon became nearly inseparable (see &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Shadow&quot; [at which time Fidelma was made a member of the &quot;Nasc Naidh&quot;, an elite corps of bodyguards to the kings of Munster, by King Colgu and became entitled to wear the golden &quot;torc&quot; of that order] and &quot;The Monk Who Vanished&quot;). After nearly a year together, they again separated, with Eadulf (reluctantly) intending to return to Canterbury and Fidelma intending to go on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. James in Iberia.

Events didn&#x27;t go quite as planned. Fidelma had only just arrived in Iberia after a very eventful voyage (see &quot;Act of Mercy&quot;) when she received a message from her brother Colgu that Eadulf had been charged with murder. Hurrying back to Ireland, she reunited with Eadulf at the Abbey of Fearna, proved his innocence and uncovered the true killer as well as the reasons behind the crime (see &quot;Our Lady of Darkness&quot;). Eadulf then convinced Fidelma to accompany him to Canterbury and then, after their business with Archbishop Theodore had been accomplished, to visit his former home of Seaxmund&#x27;s Ham (see &quot;Smoke in the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Lost Eagle&quot; in the short story collection &quot;Whispers of the Dead&quot; and &quot;The Haunted Abbot&quot;). At some point during their travels, they revealed their true feelings for and to one another, began a physical relationship (resulting in Fidelma&#x27;s pregnancy) and entered into a temporary marriage of a year and a day (with Fidelma as Eadulf&#x27;s &quot;ben charrthach&quot; or &quot;loved woman&quot; and Eadulf as Fidelma&#x27;s &quot;fer comtha&quot;); this marriage is first mentioned in &quot;The Haunted Abbot&quot;, which takes place in late December, 666. After their return to Cashel in 667, their son Alchu (&quot;Gentle Hound&quot;) was born sometime between June and July of that year.

The last three months of 667 turned rocky; Fidelma and Eadulf&#x27;s relationship was seriously troubled by Fidelma&#x27;s suffering from (but refusing to admit suffering from) what is now called postpartum depression. While Fidelma and Eadulf were away solving a series of serial killings (see &quot;Badger&#x27;s Moon&quot;), Alchu&#x27;s nurse was found murdered outside the castle of Cashel and Alchu was missing, believed to have been kidnapped. Despite objections that they were too emotionally involved to investigate properly and what turned out to be a false trail meant to implicate the Uí Fidgente, Eadulf was able to track down and successfully recover Alchu and Fidelma uncovered the real reason why Alchu&#x27;s nurse had been murdered (see &quot;The Leper&#x27;s Bell&quot;). In February 668, they celebrated a permanent marriage, despite the interruption caused by their investigation into the murder of Abbot Ultan of Cill Ria (Kilrea) (see &quot;A Prayer for the Damned&quot;). After the events of &quot;Dancing with Demons&quot; in the winter of 669–670, Eadulf was also made a member of the &quot;Nasc Naidh&quot;.

Fidelma became increasingly involved in Irish court politics and diplomacy, including thwarting several plots against the kingdom of Munster, solving the murder of the High King Sechnassach (see &quot;Dancing with Demons&quot;) and in 670 (although originally requested to act as advisor to the Irish delegation) uncovering the murderer of the Abbot Dabhoc of Tulach Oc at the Council of Autun summoned by Bishop Leodegar (see &quot;The Council of the Cursed&quot;). She and Eadulf were returning to Muman by sea in the company of Fidelma&#x27;s cousin Bressel when their ship was attacked off the coast of Armorica and Bressel was brutally murdered, along with some of the ship&#x27;s crew. After uncovering both the person responsible and a plot to assassinate the Breton king (see &quot;The Dove of Death&quot;), Fidelma decided to renounce her religious vows and become full-time legal advisor to her brother, a decision she believed Eadulf would support. Her belief proved wrong and led to a bitter quarrel between them, resulting in a physical separation with Fidelma remaining in Cashel and Eadulf going to the Abbey of Ruan. During the weeks of the separation and due to Muman&#x27;s Chief Brehon Baithen&#x27;s intentions of retiring because of a serious (ultimately fatal) illness, Fidelma became determined to succeed Baithen as Chief Brehon of Muman, and Colgu agreed to have her name submitted among the other candidates (although he informed her that he must remain neutral and that the final decision must lie with the Council of Brehons).

The murder of Brother Donnchad at the abbey of Lios Mor led Colgu and Abbot Segdae to send Fidelma to investigate but on the condition that Eadulf accompany and assist her (see &quot;The Chalice of Blood&quot;). Although they were able to work together as before, the breach was evident and after the investigation was successfully concluded, Fidelma followed through with her decision/ambition and left the religious. Unfortunately, although her name was submitted, Brehon Aedo was elected as Muman&#x27;s Chief Brehon, a decision which Fidelma took very hard (although publicly she supported the decision), and Eadulf (who had finally accepted her decision to leave the religious, although he himself remained a Brother) was extremely relieved when she agreed to undertake the investigation of an unknown found body, which led towards uncovering another plot against Muman and an unexpected traitor within Fidelma&#x27;s own family (see &quot;The Seventh Trumpet&quot;). However, Fidelma eventually concluded that the role and duties of Muman&#x27;s Chief Brehon were not for her and decided to remain a &quot;dalaigh&quot;, although she continued to be Colgu&#x27;s legal advisor.

In November 670, Colgu was nearly assassinated by a mysterious religieux but survived, although badly wounded; the assassin also killed Chief Brehon Aedo, who had tried to protect Colgu. The would-be assassin was killed, but the initial investigation into the motive for the attack (originally handled by Deputy Chief Brehon Aillin) seemed to point towards the Uí Fidgente, and so, with the approval of Colgu&#x27;s &quot;tanaiste&quot; (heir apparent) Finguine, Fidelma and Eadulf traveled into enemy territory to continue their investigation and uncovered not only the reason for the attack on Colgu but also a plot against the Uí Fidgente from within their own ruling family (see &quot;Atonement of Blood&quot;).

In February 671, Colgu had recovered from his wound and Fidelma and Eadulf had been living somewhat peacefully in Cashel when an Anglo-Saxon deputation led by the Venerable Verax, brother of Pope Vitalian, and the arrogant Bishop Arwald of Magonsaete arrived at Cashel to debate the possible establishment by Rome of an archbishopric in Ireland and which primacy in the Five Kingdoms might be considered as its seat. Matters took a serious turn before the debate even began by the murder of Brother Cerdic, the delegation&#x27;s emissary, before the delegation&#x27;s arrival and became even more complicated by the discovery on the banks of the River Siur of three murdered men, one of whom was identified as The Venerable Vitricius of Palestrina, and that the only survivor was Eadulf&#x27;s younger brother Egric. The debate quickly turned hostile; shortly afterwards, an attempt was made on Fidelma and Eadulf&#x27;s lives and more murders were committed, including those of Rudgal (the man suspected of leading the attack on The Venerable Vitricius), of Sister Dianaihm (the &quot;bann-mhoar&quot; or female steward of Abbess Lioch of Cill Naile (Killenaule), who had been asked to attend the debate) and of Egric. With Muman&#x27;s honor at stake, Fidelma and Eadulf had to somehow unravel the truth and the reasons for so many killings (see &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Seal&quot;).

In May 671, preparations for the Great Fair of Bealtain in Cashel took a sinister turn when Eadulf and Aidan, while returning to Cashel, came across a partially burned wagon containing two bodies, a female (the driver of the wagon) disguised in male clothing and a male inside the wagon who appeared to have been dead for several days. Further examination determined the burning to be a case of arson and the two deaths due to poisoning. The investigation took Fidelma and Eadulf to Osraige and to the Abbey of Cainnech, where they strove to uncover the secrets of both the Golden Stone and the mysterious Fellowship of the Raven (see &quot;The Second Death&quot;).

In June 671, Fidelma and Eadulf were horrified to learn from Colgu that Abbot Segdae had been murdered while at the fortress of Prince Donennach of the Ui Fidgente. In the absence of Muman&#x27;s Chief Brehon, Colgu immediately dispatched Fidelma and Eadulf; upon their arrival, they learned to their shock that their companion Gorman, who had been found at the scene of the crime, was being held as the chief suspect and that the Ui Fidgente religious, led by the vicious and vindictive Abbot Nannid of Mungairit, were demanding Gorman&#x27;s death as punishment according to the Penitentials. With the backing of both Prince Donennach and the Ui Fidgente Chief Brehon Faolchair, Fidelma and Eadulf immediately began an investigation, knowing that any misstep on Fidelma&#x27;s part could not only result in Gorman&#x27;s execution but also spark both a civil upheaval within the Ui Fidgente and a war against Cashel (see &quot;Penance of the Damned&quot;).

In November 671, just before the eve of the feast of Samhain, Eadulf and Aidan discovered a man murdered in an unlit pyre, dressed in the robes of a religieux and killed by the ritualistic &quot;three deaths&quot;. When a strange woman known as &quot;Brancheó&quot; appeared in a raven-feather cloak foretelling of the ancient gods returning to exact revenge upon the mortal world, she was quickly branded a suspect. In their search for the killer, Sister Fidelma and Eadulf discovered that their investigation was linked to a book stolen from the Papal Secret Archives which could destroy the New Faith in the Five Kingdoms (see &quot;Night of the Lightbringer&quot;).

As 671 drew to a close, Fidelma traveled to the Abbey of Finnbarr on a personal secret mission to question the abbot, but found that he had been murdered and the suspect, a young girl, had fled. In spite of Fidelma&#x27;s refusal to reveal her real purposes (which she had sworn an oath to not reveal) to Eadulf and her other companions, they agreed to accompany her on this investigation. However, vicious rumors began to circulate of a plot by Fidelma&#x27;s family, the Eoghannacht, to murder the High King and kidnap his wife, and Fidelma&#x27;s refusal to confide even in Eadulf meant that not only that Fidelma&#x27;s life was in danger but also that she would be truly on her own to face what was to happen (see &quot;Bloodmoon&quot;).

The year 672 proved to be another year of mystery and political intrigue for Fidelma and Eadulf. In February, Fidelma and Eadulf were traveling from the Abbey of Lios Mhor back to Cashel when they reached the village of Cloichin just in time to prevent the lynching, presided over by Brother Gadra (a firm adherent of the Penitentials), of a man accused of murdering a local farmer, his wife and two sons. Determined that the man, a foreign vagrant, should be given a fair trial, Fidelma and Eadulf remained in the area, but events, including a claimant to the murdered farmer&#x27;s inheritance, began to spiral into a far more sinister pattern that would cost more lives (see &quot;Blood in Eden&quot;).

In Spring 672, the body of Brother Brocc, who had been traveling with Princess Gelgeis, King Colgu&#x27;s betrothed, on a secret mission, was found and brought to the Abbey of Gleann Da Loch. Fidelma, Eadulf and Enda were dispatched to the kingdom of Laigin to discover the truth, but were soon confronted by more deaths, warnings of demonic shapeshifters and brigands stealing gold and silver from the ancient mines, and rumors of a war between the Kingdoms of Laigin and Muman (see &quot;The Shapeshifter&#x27;s Lair&quot;).

In May 672, just before the Feast of Beltaine, a council of the seven senior princes of the kingdom of Muman was to gather at Cashel to discuss King Colgú&#x27;s policies. Before the council actually met, Brother Conchobhar, the keeper of the sacred sword that symbolized the King&#x27;s authority to rule, was found murdered. While trying to solve this mystery and as rumors of an attempt to overthrow Colgú began to spread, Fidelma and Eadulf also had to contend with news that a plague ship had landed at a nearby port (see &quot;The House of Death&quot;).

Later that same month, during the renovation of the abbey of Muman at Imleach Iubhair, Fidelma and Eadulf were called in to investigate both the destruction of the guest hostel by fire and the death of one of the guests: Bishop Brodulf of Luxovium, cousin to the King of Franks, whom they discovered had been stabbed to death before the fire had even started (see &quot;Death of a Heretic&quot;).

In the summer of 672, shortly after the marriage of Colgu and Princess Gelgeis, a member of Princess Gelgeis&#x27; personal bodyguard, a group of female warriors called &quot;the Daughters of the Storm&quot;, was found killed in their locked sleeping chamber, and shortly afterwards the stewardess of the royal house was poisoned. With a huge group of suspects, Fidelma and Eadulf had to work quickly to uncover the killer (see &quot;Revenge of the Stormbringer&quot;).

In 675, Fidelma received a letter telling of the ultimate fates of Bishop Leodegar and some of those connected with the 670 Council of Autun (see the epilogue of &quot;The Council of the Cursed&quot;).

Because of the death of her parents at an early age, Fidelma grew up quite independent and self-reliant; at times she refuses to delegate gathering of evidence to anyone, even Eadfulf (although she does admit that Eadulf&#x27;s &quot;mind was just as sharp and penetrating as her own.&quot; - &quot;The Council of the Cursed&quot;). However, she suffered many betrayals in the past (Cian, Liadin, Abbess Ita of Cill Dara) so that she became extremely cautious with her emotions and it is not easy for her to become close to people; it took quite a long time for her to fully realize her feelings for Eadulf, and her only close female friend/confidente is Della, a former prostitute (it is to Della that she turns to for comfort and counsel when she believes her marriage to Eadulf is in danger of falling apart in &quot;The Leper&#x27;s Bell&quot;). She also admits quite freely that one of her worst faults is her temper, and she is constantly amazed that Eadulf shows so much patience with her: &quot;She knew that she could not really contemplate an existence without Eadulf&#x27;s support. Who else would tolerate her sharp temper, which she accepted was her biggest fault?&quot; &quot;(The Chalice of Blood)&quot;

However, in spite of her self-confessed shortcomings, she has proven herself to be devoted to family and friends and a caring and loving wife and mother (although she does wish that her duties as a &quot;dalaigh&quot; didn&#x27;t cause her to be away from her son so often and for so long).

===Brother Eadulf===
Brother Eadulf has appeared in all but three of the &quot;Sister Fidelma&quot; novels and in one short story (&quot;The Lost Eagle&quot;).

An Angle by birth from Seaxmund&#x27;s Ham (today &quot;Saxmundham&quot;) in the Kingdom of East Anglia (Eadulf refers to himself as an &quot;Angle&quot;, while almost everybody else refers to him as &quot;Saxon&quot;, much to his annoyance), Eadulf was raised as a hereditary &quot;gerefa&quot;, or reeve, of his people. Eadulf was converted to Christianity by an Irish monk named Fursa sometime before the novels begin and subsequently educated in Ireland, studying first at Daru (Durrow) then medicine at the great medical school of Tuaim Brecain. He then undertook a pilgrimage to Rome to understand the differences between the ideas of the Church of Rome and those of the Church of Ireland, remaining there studying for two years and returning as a follower of Rome. In the novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Seal&quot;, it is learned that he has a younger brother Egric, who, although both brothers were converted to Christianity, chose to follow the path of the warrior and that due to lack of news about him Eadulf believed Egric to be dead. It is also revealed in the same novel that Eadulf&#x27;s mother died from ergot poisoning when Eadulf was fifteen and that his father died from the Yellow Plague three years later.

In the novel &quot;Absolution by Murder&quot;, which is set during the Synod of Whitby, Brother Eadulf was part of the deputation from Canterbury to the Synod, where he met Sister Fidelma for the first time. After the Synod&#x27;s conclusion, both joined a party to Rome. After the events of &quot;Shroud for the Archbishop&quot; in Rome, Fidelma returned to Ireland while Eadulf remained in Rome as secretary to the new Archbishop of Canterbury Theodore of Tarsus. Later, he was sent to Cashel as Theodore&#x27;s emissary and was reunited with Fidelma in &quot;The Subtle Serpent&quot;. After the events of that novel, he returned to Cashel with Fidelma and in subsequent novels they became almost inseparable companions and collaborators.

Eadulf and Fidelma&#x27;s intellectual and personal relationship develops throughout the series, despite another separation in which Eadulf (reluctantly and partly at Fidelma&#x27;s insistence) intended to return to Canterbury. However, he almost never made it back to Britain, as at the Abbey of Fearna he was charged with rape and murder and almost hanged (a predicament from which it seemed that Fidelma would be unable to rescue him). Eadulf convinced Fidelma to accompany him to Canterbury, and after concluding his business with Archbishop Theodore, he returned to Ireland with Fidelma. In 667, they entered into a trial marriage of a year and a day, during which their son Alchu was born. In February 668, Eadulf and Fidelma celebrated a permanent marriage (see &quot;A Prayer for the Damned&quot;).

Unfortunately, as time passed, Eadulf&#x27;s devotion to the world of the Faith began to clash with Fidelma&#x27;s growing ambition to pursue a secular life devoted to the law. A serious emotional and physical breach was made between them when Fidelma announced her decision to renounce her religious vows and Eadulf sadly realized that he could not change her mind (see &quot;The Dove of Death&quot; and &quot;The Chalice of Blood&quot;). &quot;The Chalice of Blood&quot; concluded with Fidelma telling Eadulf that she had made her decision about her future and now he must come to a decision about his own, which he did ... accepting her decision and supporting her, but still remaining a Brother.

Tremayne uses Brother Eadulf&#x27;s status as an outsider to the Celtic communities in which many of his and Fidelma&#x27;s cases take place to provide explanations about legal and cultural matters to his readers. This allows Tremayne to include many details about the history of the Celtic church and society, without overtly appearing to educate.

Being a foreigner, Eadulf&#x27;s status in Ireland is originally that of &quot;cu glas&quot; (which translates as &quot;grey dog&quot;), meaning an &quot;exile from over the sea&quot; and a person without legal standing or honor price &quot;(for a definition of this term, see &quot;Status&quot; in Early Irish Law)&quot;; however, his rank as &quot;techtaire&quot; (emissary or ambassador) between Archbishop Theodore and Fidelma&#x27;s brother King Colgu gave him a high honor price of eight &quot;cumals&quot; (a &quot;cumal&quot; being the value of three cows) under Irish law (see &quot;Our Lady of Darkness&quot;) and since his marriage to Fidelma (recognized and approved by her family) he is now considered a &quot;deorad De&quot; (an &quot;exile of God&quot;) and has an honor price of half that of Fidelma&#x27;s but he is not entitled to make legal contracts without her permission (she is also responsible for any debts that he might incur) or have any legal responsibility in the raising of Alchu. Despite these legalities, he is treated as an equal and a friend and accepted as a member of Fidelma&#x27;s family. After the events of &quot;Dancing with Demons&quot; in the winter of 669–670, he was made a member of the &quot;Nasc Naidh&quot;, an elite corps of bodyguards to the kings of Munster, by King Colgu and entitled to wear the golden &quot;torc&quot; of that order.

Brother Eadulf is a stolid man who provides a much-needed stability to Fidelma during emotionally difficult cases (he knows that her insecurity stems from both her parents dying when she was very young). In many of the novels, Tremayne uses the same phrases (with some slight variations) to describe Fidelma and Eadulf&#x27;s intellectual relationship:

:&quot;She missed their debates. She missed the way she could tease Eadulf over their conflicting opinions and philosophies, the way he would always rise goodnaturedly to the bait. Their arguments would rage but there was no enmity between them. They would learn together as they examined their interpretations and debated their ideas.&quot; &quot;(Suffer Little Children)&quot;

Eadulf&#x27;s courage and love of family are undeniable (proven many times, including his rescue of their son Alchu in &quot;The Leper&#x27;s Bell&quot; and of Fidelma herself in &quot;The Seventh Trumpet&quot;). His medical knowledge and assistance is often very valuable as well (especially in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Seal&quot; when he must perform an emergency amputation), and Fidelma has often admitted that Eadulf has an uncanny ability to see the obvious that she has overlooked. On one occasion (after a &quot;cram course&quot; in the Law of the &quot;Fenechus&quot;) he acted as Fidelma&#x27;s advocate to successfully get her released when she was charged with murder (see &quot;Valley of the Shadow&quot;), although his use of a bluff to get a witness to admit to being paid for his testimony, thus discrediting it, it shocked her sensibilities as a &quot;dalaigh&quot;, and he was able to provide a provision of law (much to Fidelma&#x27;s surprise) that allowed her to provide an argument that led to the uncovering of a murderer (see &quot;The Chalice of Blood&quot;). In &quot;The Seventh Trumpet&quot;, he demonstrated his own powers of deduction to such a degree that Fidelma remarks, &quot;Every day, you become more and more a Brehon&quot;; in &quot;The Chalice of Blood&quot;, she tells him: &quot;As far as I am concerned, without you, your advice, your ability to analyse, I would not have succeeded in many of the investigations we have undertaken ... you will forever be my soul-mate, my &quot;anam chara&quot;, and if you go my soul will die.&quot;

Part of Eadulf&#x27;s charm is his honest humility, and despite all he has accomplished and the fame and respect he has earned while working with Fidelma he considers himself to be quite an ordinary man (much to the amusement of Brother Conchobar, who in &quot;A Prayer for the Damned&quot; points out to him that Fidelma would never have chosen an ordinary man to share her life with). He is not a person who always feels comfortable in the hustle and bustle of a major castle town like Cashel, and often wishes that he and Fidelma could retire to a mixed religious community in a more secluded area (although that dream had to be given up when Fidelma renounced the religious life). He is very humorous about his own shortcomings (including poor horsemanship and seasickness) and is normally a very tolerant and even-tempered person, but on a few occasions Eadulf has been provoked to the point where he has indeed lost his temper with another person and with Fidelma herself, much to her astonishment (see &quot;The Leper&#x27;s Bell&quot; and &quot;The Chalice of Blood&quot;). Nominally he remains an adherent to the Church of Rome (he still wears a Roman tonsure), but over time, due in part to his debates with Fidelma, in part to his long-term residence and personal experiences in Eireann and in part to his personal interactions with both local and foreign Church dignitaries, his views have become much more moderate to the point where he has realized that he cannot blindly follow the changes in the Faith that come from Rome, such as and including the increased call for religious celibacy and the continual attempt to supplant the Laws of the &quot;Fenechus&quot; with the Penitentials.

==Themes==
In the course of the series, Sister Fidelma journeys to many different parts of Western Europe, including Ireland, Wales, Northumbria, Hispania, Brittany, Francia and Rome. The differences between the societies she encounters and her native country is an ongoing theme throughout the series. Through Fidelma&#x27;s adventures, Peter Tremayne introduces his readers to his views and interpretations of events and conflicts of 7th century Ireland. Major themes in the Sister Fidelma series include:

&quot;Inter-Societal Themes&quot;: Differences between Celtic society and other societies of the time
*The system of government, in particular the method of selecting a ruler. (the Celtic and early Anglo-Saxon system of election within elite kin-groups versus later systems of primogeniture.)
*Legal systems, conventions of legal proceedings (including methods of establishing innocence or guilt), and punishments for criminals.
*Political alliances, truces, and disputes between different countries.
*The legality of slavery.
*The role of women. (Relatively unrestricted in Celtic society; much more restricted in Roman and Anglo-Saxon societies.)

&quot;Intra-Societal Themes&quot;: Issues within Celtic society itself.
*Conflict between local (the five provinces of Ireland) and central (the High King at Tara) political authorities.
*Conflicts between different clans or regions of Ireland.
*Various aspects of Irish society, including language, geography, history, medicine, professions, customs, food, and hygiene.

&quot;Religious Themes&quot;
*The ongoing struggle between Celtic and Roman forms of Christianity for supremacy in the British Isles.
*The growing claims of Ard Macha (Armagh) to hold religious governance over all of the five kingdoms and their sub-kingdoms.
*The meeting of older pagan and newly introduced Christian forms of worship (sometimes this occurs easily in the Fidelma series, other times bitter conflicts result).
*The use of secular or traditional Irish law versus the Penitentials.
*The question of whether clergy should be celibate.
*The value of superstition and astrology.

<text>Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) is a digital rights management (DRM) technology that restricts digital home technologies including DVD players and televisions by encrypting interconnections between devices. This permits the distribution of content through other devices such as personal computers or portable media players, if they also implement the DTCP standards. DTCP has also been referred to as &quot;5C&quot; content protection, a reference to the five companies that created DTCP; Hitachi, Intel, Matsushita, Sony, and Toshiba.

The standard was originally proposed in February 1998, when the five companies presented the system to the Copy Protection Technical Working Group (CPTWG), an &quot;ad hoc&quot; body organized to evaluate DRM technologies. The five companies subsequently established the Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator (DTLA) in June 1998 to simplify licensing procedures and promote acceptance of the DTCP method by content providers, electronics manufacturers, and broadcast service providers. They also released the 5C Digital Transmission Content Protection White Paper describing the system. The paper specifies Hitachi&#x27;s M6 cipher as the baseline encryption system, which was already in widespread use in the Japanese cable industry.

At the time, FireWire was widely regarded as the up-and-coming standard for interconnecting media devices, although this has not been widely adopted in the decade following. More recently there appears to be a move to using TCP/IP carried on high-speed ethernet and WiFi connections to replace FireWire and similar systems, a move epitomized by the Apple TV. The DTCP standard has branched out to cover a variety of media types to respond to these industry changes, and now supports USB, IP, WiFi, Bluetooth and MOST (a media standard for automotive platforms) in addition to FireWire.

The DTCP specification is proprietary and is only disseminated to members, who agree to the DTLA agreements (some fees need to be paid to even get the specification). An &quot;informational version&quot; of the specification, omitting some critical details of the implementation, is freely available.

==DTCP+==
In November 2010 the Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator proposed enhancements to DTCP known as DTCP+. This enhanced specification was due to be completed in January 2011. DTCP+ adds the following capabilities:
*Digital Only Token
*Media agnostic&quot; way to carry Content Management Information (CMI)
*Copy Count CMI
*Remote Access capability

<doc id="1134578" wikidata="Q146849" url="?curid=1134578" title="New Eltham">
<text>New Eltham is a suburban area of South East London, England, primarily in the Royal Borough of Greenwich with some parts in the London Borough of Bexley. It is located south east of Eltham and north west of Sidcup.

==History==
New Eltham is a largely residential suburb of Greater London developed on former farmland to the south of Eltham in and around the small hamlet and crossroads of Pope Street, centred around what is today Avery Hill Road. On the main building of Wyborne School (Footscray Road) there is a sign clearly identifying it as &quot;Pope Street&quot; School, built in 1904.

New Eltham railway station was opened as Pope Street Station in April 1878, twelve years after the opening of the Dartford Loop Line. The station was renamed New Eltham in 1886 although Pope Street was retained as a suffix until 1927. In 1974 the bridge (crossing the railway line) at Avery Hill Road was widened to allow buses to cross it. This replaced a narrow iron bridge which only had a separate path on one side for pedestrians.

The Beehive public house was rebuilt in 1897. Most of New Eltham&#x27;s housing dates from the 1930s. A library was built in 1931.

As part of London&#x27;s Cold War civil defences, a rectangular windowless blockhouse was built in 1954 behind New Eltham library. It served as the Woolwich Borough Control and when Woolwich merged with Greenwich in 1965 it took over the role as the Greenwich Borough Control. The control was part of the South East London Group reporting to the Regional Group War HQ at Chislehurst and later to Pear Tree House.

Until the mid-1970s New Eltham had 3 butchers, 2 greengrocers, 3 grocers, 2 toy shops, a shoe repairer, 2 barbers, a radio and television repair shop, a clothing and material store, timber yard, cycle sales and repairs, 2 motor spares, hardware store, 2 dairies and a fishmongers. The Co-operative supermarket was previously a series of smaller separate purpose Co-op shops: a greengrocer, a chemist, butcher, and grocery store. A fishmongers later became a fish and chips shop (and still is as of 2021). Behind this, in what is now the car park was the Co-op dairy; the other (Unigate) was in Green Lane near Fiveways in what is now a small business park.

==Sport and recreation==
Championship side Charlton Athletic has a training ground in New Eltham, down Sparrows Lane. The area&#x27;s other football teams include Newpark F.C., which played in the South London Football Alliance Division 3 and are currently holders of the Beckenham Hospital Cup, and one New Eltham team, playing in the London &amp; Kent Borders League and based at the STC Ground on Ivor Grove

Footscray RUFC is located on Footscray Road. It has three men&#x27;s team (the first team playing in the Shepherd Neame Kent 2 league), a ladies team and minis rugby.

RACS Cricket Club are based in the area.

New Eltham also has a running club, New Eltham Joggers. A section of the South East London Green Chain walk passes through New Eltham.

New Eltham Operatic Society is a member of the National Operatic and Dramatic Association. Dance classes are held above the Co-op store.

==Amenities==
Near the railway station is the library, the Co-operative food store, a cluster of small shops and the Post Office. Larger chain stores may be found in nearby Eltham and Sidcup high streets. The public house was refurbished in 2009.

==Nearby places==

New Eltham borders Avery Hill to the north and north east, Sidcup to the east and south east, Chislehurst to the south, Mottingham to the west and Eltham to the north west.

==Transport==
New Eltham station serves the area, with services to Central London and Gravesend. New Eltham is served by several Transport for London bus services connecting it with Beckenham, Bexleyheath, Bromley, Catford, Chislehurst, Eltham, Lewisham, New Addington, New Cross, Sidcup and Swanley.

<doc id="1134587" wikidata="Q3354682" url="?curid=1134587" title="Operation Copperhead">
<text>Operation Copperhead was a small military deception operation run by the British during the Second World War. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, the cover plan for the invasion of Normandy in 1944 and was intended to mislead German intelligence as to the location of General Bernard Montgomery. The operation was conceived by Dudley Clarke in early 1944 after he watched the film &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot;. Following the war M. E. Clifton James wrote a book about the operation, &quot;I Was Monty&#x27;s Double&quot;. It was later adapted into a film, with James in the lead role.

The German high command expected Montgomery (one of the best-known Allied commanders) to play a key role in any cross-Channel bridgehead. Clarke and the other deception planners reasoned that a high-profile appearance outside the United Kingdom would suggest that an Allied invasion was not imminent. An appropriate look-alike was found, M. E. Clifton James, who spent a short time with Montgomery to familiarise himself with the general&#x27;s mannerisms. On 26 May 1944, James flew first to Gibraltar and then to Algiers, making appearances where the Allies knew German intelligence agents would spot him. He then flew secretly to Cairo and remained in hiding until Montgomery&#x27;s public appearance in Normandy following the invasion.

The operation did not appear to have any significant impact on German plans and was not reported high up the chain of command. It was executed some time before D-Day, and in the midst of several other Allied deceptions. German intelligence might have suspected a trick, or not attributed much importance to the visit.

==Background==

In preparation for the 1944 invasion of Normandy, the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename Bodyguard. The overall aim of the plan was to confuse the German high command as to the exact location and timing of the invasion. Significant time was spent constructing the First United States Army Group, a notional army to threaten Pas de Calais, along with political and visual deceptions to communicate a fictional Allied battle plan. Copperhead was a small portion of Bodyguard conceived by Dudley Clarke. Earlier in the war Clarke had pioneered the idea of strategic deception, forming a deception department in Cairo named &#x27;A&#x27; Force. Clarke and &#x27;A&#x27; Force were not officially in charge of Bodyguard planning (a role that fell to the London Controlling Section), but because of the location of the deception the Cairo planners organised much of the operation.

On a visit to Naples in January 1944 Clarke had seen the movie &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot;, in which actor Miles Mander makes a brief appearance. The film involves one character impersonating another and Clarke suggested attempting the same trick in real life. He proposed an operation to mislead German commanders as to Montgomery&#x27;s location in the days immediately before the Normandy landings (codenamed Operation Neptune).

Montgomery was one of the most prominent Allied commanders and the German high command expected him to be present for any invasion of France. Clarke hoped Montgomery&#x27;s apparent presence in Gibraltar and Africa would lend support to the idea that the Allies might be planning landings in southern France, as part of Operation Vendetta, rather than across the Channel. While in London, in February 1944, Clarke, the London Controlling Section and Ops (B) drafted Copperhead in support of Vendetta.

==Operation==

Mander, the actor from &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot;, was located in Hollywood but found to be too tall in real life. Another look-alike was identified but before he could be drafted into the operation he broke a leg in a motorbike accident. Eventually, Lieutenant-Colonel J. V. B. Jervis-Reid, head of Ops (B), spotted a photograph of M. E. Clifton James in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;. James, an Australian, had spent 25 years as an actor before the war, and at the time was assigned to the Royal Army Pay Corps. Colonel David Niven, a well-known British actor, was asked to contact James and offer him a screen test for future army films. When he arrived at the meeting, James was told his true role.

James was not a perfect stand-in for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section&#x27;s Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight to make sure he did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery&#x27;s approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.

Allied deceivers used their double agent network to circulate the idea that Montgomery would command ground forces during the invasion. Then, on 26 May 1944, James flew overnight from RAF Northolt to Gibraltar, where the Germans maintained an observation post overlooking the airport from across the Spanish border. The plane had to circle for an hour before landing to allow James, who had smuggled a bottle of gin onto the flight, to sober up. He then attended breakfast with the British governor, Sir Ralph Eastwood, before departing again for the airfield. The Allies had arranged for Ignacio Molina Pérez, a Spanish envoy known to be a German spy, to visit Government House. After observing James&#x27;s departure, Pérez hurriedly crossed the border to place a call to his German handler.

James then flew to Algiers, where he was publicly paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by &#x27;A&#x27; Force&#x27;s Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery&#x27;s presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade for a few more days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.

==Impact==
The impact of Copperhead is unclear. The visit was reported up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received requests for information about Montgomery&#x27;s movements. There is no indication that Montgomery&#x27;s appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this to the fact that the deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.

Another factor was that, in early May 1944, an uncontrolled agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on details of a meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery&#x27;s appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts it does not appear that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence in fact believed Montgomery had been present but still presumed it to be part of a feint. The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions, and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture.

James did not enjoy the experience. Although he received equivalent pay (£10 per day) to Montgomery during the operation, it had been a stressful assignment. Following Montgomery&#x27;s public appearance on the Normandy beachhead, James flew back to England and resumed his role within the Pay Corps and was warned not to discuss the operation. Dennis Wheatley, in his memoirs, commented that he felt James had been treated &quot;shabbily&quot; for his efforts.

==Later depictions==
In 1954 James wrote an account of the operation, &quot;I Was Monty&#x27;s Double&quot; (published in the United States as &quot;The Counterfeit General&quot;). The British government made no attempt to stop publication, and in 1958 the book was adapted into a film of the same name. James starred as himself, alongside John Mills as an intelligence agent.

<doc id="1134590" wikidata="Q831718" url="?curid=1134590" title="Sauðárkrókur">
<text>Sauðárkrókur () is a town on the Skagafjörður in northern Iceland. It is the seat of both the Sveitarfélagið Skagafjörður (&#x27;Municipality of Skagafjörður&#x27;) and the Northwestern Region.

Sauðárkrókur is the largest town in Northwest Iceland and the second-largest town on the north coast of Iceland, with a population of 2,612. It is the centre for commerce and services in the district, and an important link in Iceland&#x27;s food production. The population of Sauðárkrókur has grown steadily in recent years, and its economy is relatively diverse.

Economic mainstays are fisheries, dairy production, light industry and broad-based services such as computer and engineering operations, financials, consulting, design and printing. The natural hot pool located north of Sauðárkrókur is mentioned in the &quot;Grettis saga&quot;.

== Etymology ==

Sauðárkrókur got its name from the creek that runs through the land. The creek is named Sauðá, and the name Sauðárkrókur indicates that this is the coast where Sauðá meets the Arctic Ocean. Directly translated to English, the name would be &#x27;Sheep-river-hook&#x27;.

== History ==

=== First settlements ===
Iceland was settled in the late 9th century, mostly by Scandinavian Vikings. The Skagafjörður region had many settlers, who divided the land according to commonly acknowledged rules. The land where Sauðárkrókur stands was first taken by the Viking Sæmundr Suðureyski (&quot;Sæmundur from the South Islands&quot;. &#x27;South Islands&#x27; is the name Vikings gave the Hebrides islands off the coast of Scotland), but as he was marking his land another Viking, called Skefill, successfully &quot;stole&quot; the land where the oldest part of the town is today. These settlers did not build their homes at Sauðárkrókur, and the current site of the town was not settled until about 1,000 years later.

=== Market and merchants ===
Docking ships in Skagafjörður was not an easy task for sailors and merchants. Few natural harbors are to be found, especially on the west coast of the fjord, and most merchants docked at the trading posts of Hofsós, Grafarós and Kolkuós on the east coast of the fjord. During the Danish monopoly (1602–1787) Hofsós was the only permitted trading post in Skagafjörður. At that time the river Héraðsvötn was a huge obstacle for those living on the west side of the fjord, and many people died crossing the river to reach the market. As the population on the west side of the valley grew, so did the need for an accessible market place; and several times privateers tried their luck by illegally trading from their ships by the shore of Sauðárkrókur. In 1856 Sauðárkrókur became a permitted trading post, and merchants were allowed to trade from their ships.

=== The first inhabitants ===
In 1871 the first real settlement at Sauðárkrókur took place. The blacksmith Árni Árnason, with his wife Sigríður Eggertsdóttir and several children, settled there to provide blacksmith services to the growing farming community in this prosperous region. The couple also decided to sell drinks and overnight services; this part of the business grew fast and earned Árni a new nickname, &quot;Árni Vert&quot; or &quot;innkeeper Árni&quot;. In 1873 the first merchant settled in Sauðárkrókur. The shopkeeper Erlendur Hallsson built the second house here, trading from his living room. By 1900 around 400 inhabitants lived here, and the settlement was evolving into a fully formed village with a hospital, school and church.

==Climate==
Sauðárkrókur has a mild subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) bordering on a tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;). Average temperature year round in Sauðárkrókur is about , with an average low temperature of around in the coldest months of the year (January–February).

Being located in the North Atlantic, the region is quite windy. However severe storms are unusual. Average wind speed in the town of Sauðárkrókur is 6.7 m/s. with wind directions from North and South to South-west. The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm (20 inches) distributed fairly evenly over the year, although spring and early summer seems to be the driest season.

Sauðárkrókur experiences midnight sun for 4 to 5 days around the time of the summer solstice. This is due to atmospheric refraction since the town lies just south of the Arctic Circle. Although Sauðárkrókur doesn&#x27;t experience polar night, the shortest length of daylight is 3 hours 1 minute, from 11:46 UTC until 14:47 UTC on the winter solstice.


==Transport==
The town and neighbouring area is served by Sauðárkrókur Airport, although it does not have scheduled flights. The nearest airport with scheduled flights is Akureyri Airport, about away by road. The town is connected to the Route 1 via Varmahlíð through route 75 or alternatively via Blönduós through routes 744 and 74 (when road conditions are suitable). Reykjavík is about away by road.

==Sports==
The town has a stadium, the Sauðárkróksvöllur, built in 2004. 
The local sports club is UMF Tindastóll.

<text>Ned Joel Block (born 1942) is an American philosopher working in philosophy of mind who has made important contributions to the understanding of consciousness and the philosophy of cognitive science. He has been professor of philosophy and psychology at New York University since 1996, and a Silver Professor since 2005.

==Education and career==
Block obtained his PhD from Harvard University in 1971 under the direction of Hilary Putnam. He joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as an assistant professor of philosophy (1971–1977), and then served as associate professor of philosophy (1977–1983), professor of philosophy (1983–1996) and as chair of the philosophy section (1989–1995). He has, since 1996, been a professor in the departments of philosophy and psychology at New York University (NYU).

Block received the Jean Nicod Prize in 2013, and has given the William James Lectures at Harvard University in 2012 and the John Locke Lectures at Oxford University in 2013, among many others.

Block is Past President of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences in 2004.

He is married to the developmental psychologist Susan Carey. Block is ethnically Jewish.

==Philosophical work==

===Philosophy of artificial intelligence===
Block is noted for presenting the Blockhead argument against the Turing test as a test of intelligence in a paper titled &quot;Psychologism and Behaviorism&quot; (1981). He is also known for his criticism of functionalism, arguing that a system with the same functional states as a human is not necessarily conscious.

Block has been a judge at the Loebner Prize contest, a contest in the tradition of the Turing Test to determine whether a conversant is a computer or a human.

===Consciousness===
In his more recent work on consciousness, he has made a distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness, where phenomenal consciousness consists of subjective experience and feelings and access consciousness consists of that information globally available in the cognitive system for the purposes of reasoning, speech and high-level action control. He has argued that access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness might not always coincide in human beings.

====Overflow argument====

Ned Block has mounted the overflow argument, which argues against the view that phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness are identical. Instead, Ned Block argues that phenomenal consciousness overflows conscious access, meaning that one can consciously experience something that they do not have conscious access to. Empirically, this means that a subject can have some content included in their conscious experience, but lack the cognitive recognition of the content that is necessary to report that the content was in fact experienced.

<doc id="1134595" wikidata="Q279006" url="?curid=1134595" title="Olsok">
<text>Olsok () is a national day of celebration on July 29 in the Nordic countries of Norway and the Faroe Islands, and also in the provinces of Härjedalen in Sweden and Savonlinna in Finland.

==Background==
King Olaf II Haraldsson of Norway is remembered as Rex perpetuus Norvegiae, the Eternal King of Norway. July 29 is traditionally the date of the death of King Olaf at the Battle of Stiklestad, north of Nidaros (Trondheim), Norway, in 1030. King Olaf&#x27;s martyrdom at Stiklestad appears to have contributed decisively to establishing Christianity throughout the nation of Norway. King Olaf was subsequently canonized in Nidaros on 3 August 1031 following efforts principally of north Bishop Grimkell.

Until the Lutheran Reformation in the 16th century, Olsok was a major church feast in the Nordic countries. The late 19th and the early 20th century saw a renewed interest in Olsok, particularly in Norway. The Roman Catholic Church in Norway recognizes Olsok as a major feast all over the country, while the Lutheran Church of Norway recognizes the day principally in Nidaros Cathedral as well as other churches. Starting with the 900th anniversary of Stiklestad in 1930, July 29 has been an official flag day (&quot;Olsokdagen&quot;) in Norway. Since 1954, &quot;The Saint Olav Drama&quot; has been performed at Stiklestad each year.

In the Faroe Islands, Ólavsøka is also recognized on July 29. Ólavsøka is the biggest summer festival in the Faroe Islands and is commonly celebrated over a several day period. This tradition dates from when the islands were part of Norway during the Middle Ages. Within Sweden &quot;Olofsmässa&quot; (&quot;Olaf&#x27;s Mass&quot;) is recognized principally within the former Norwegian province of Härjedalen.

Within Finland, &quot;Pyhän Olavin Päivä&quot; (&quot;St. Olaf&#x27;s Day&quot;) is celebrated principally at Savonlinna, site of Olavinlinna (&quot;Olof&#x27;s Castle&quot;), since St. Olaf is the patron saint of the site.

<doc id="1134608" wikidata="Q2264298" url="?curid=1134608" title="Seddon, New Zealand">
<text>Seddon is a small town in Marlborough, New Zealand. It is located south of Blenheim, close to the mouths of the Awatere and Blind Rivers and the Lake Grassmere salt works.

Salt and lime are major local industries, and the Awatere Valley is an important part of the Marlborough wine region.

The town was named for a former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Richard Seddon.

== Geography ==

===Earthquakes===
Seddon has been close to the epicentres of several significant earthquakes.

On the morning of 16 October 1848, Marlborough was struck by a damaging earthquake later estimated to be between magnitude 7.4 and 7.7. The epicentre of this earthquake was 45 km southeast of Seddon.

On 23 April 1966, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake with an epicentre in Cook Strait, 40 km east of Seddon was most strongly felt in the town, damaging the chimney on almost every house in town.
In July and August 2013 Seddon was closest settlement to the epicentres of a doublet earthquake event. First, in late July, a series of sizeable earthquakes struck the region over a period of a few days being felt strongly in Blenheim, Wellington and the rest of Central New Zealand, the strongest being a magnitude 6.5 and having its epicentre in Cook Strait. Then on 16 August 2013 a magnitude 6.6 earthquake with its epicentre under Lake Grassmere struck about 2:30 PM and was followed by a series of aftershocks over the next few hours, one of which was above magnitude 6 and several others above magnitude 5. This came just a few years after devastating earthquakes affected Christchurch, 285 km away.

== Demographics ==
Seddon is defined by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the wider Awatere statistical area.
Seddon had a population of 552 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 63 people (12.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 57 people (11.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 192 households, comprising 300 males and 252 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.19 males per female, with 96 people (17.4%) aged under 15 years, 93 (16.8%) aged 15 to 29, 282 (51.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 75 (13.6%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 78.3% European/Pākehā, 16.8% Māori, 13.0% Pasifika, 2.7% Asian, and 2.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.0% had no religion, 27.7% were Christian, 0.5% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% were Muslim and 2.2% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 30 (6.6%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 126 (27.6%) people had no formal qualifications. 33 people (7.2%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 261 (57.2%) people were employed full-time, 66 (14.5%) were part-time, and 12 (2.6%) were unemployed.

==Transport==
State Highway 1 passes through Seddon on its route between Blenheim and Christchurch.

The Marlborough section of the Main North Line railway reached Seddon from Blenheim in October 1902. This also saw the construction of a combined road-rail bridge over the Awatere River north of the town, with the single-lane road below the rail. The bridge remained in service for road traffic until October 2007, when a new two-lane road bridge opened. Seddon was the southern terminus of the railway until the line was extended to Ward in April 1911; the full line through to Christchurch didn&#x27;t open until December 1945. Today, Seddon is served by the Coastal Pacific train, which runs once daily each way during the summer months.

A train derailment at Blind River, south of Seddon, on 25 February 1948, killed six people and injured 40 others.

==Education==
Seddon School is the sole school in the town. It is a coeducational full primary (year 1–8) school with a roll of as of The nearest state secondary schools are Marlborough Boys&#x27; College and Marlborough Girls&#x27; College in Blenheim.

<text>The McLellan Galleries are a major exhibition space in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, situated behind a frontage of shops and offices in Sauchiehall Street.

==History==

As part of the city&#x27;s expansion on Blythswood Hill spearheaded by William Harley, the Galleries were built in 1855-6 to a design by architect James Smith of Blythswood Square at a cost of £40,000. They are named after their founder, Archibald McLellan (1795–1854), a coach builder, councillor and patron of the arts. Following his death, Glasgow Corporation acquired the galleries and collection, and for a time they were known as the Corporation Halls before reverting to their former owner&#x27;s name. The Galleries housed Glasgow School of Art from 1869 to 1899.

In October 1986, the shop frontage building housing the Galleries was ravaged by fire, but they re-opened in 1990 as the largest quality, climate-controlled, temporary exhibition gallery in Scotland. They continue to be the largest exhibition space in the city-centre.

While Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum was closed for refurbishment between 2003 and 2006, the McLellan Galleries hosted a display of its best-loved works.

The McLellan Galleries were then leased to the Glasgow School of Art as studio and storage space in preparation for the planned redevelopment of the Glasgow School of Art campus.

Since 2012 there has been public discussion involving user organisations such as the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts with a view to re-establishing the McLellan Galleries as a major feature in Glasgow’s cultural life.

The galleries have been protected as a category B listed building since 1970.

<doc id="1134614" wikidata="Q696822" url="?curid=1134614" title="Arnoldi iteration">
<text>In numerical linear algebra, the Arnoldi iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm and an important example of an iterative method. Arnoldi finds an approximation to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general (possibly non-Hermitian) matrices by constructing an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace, which makes it particularly useful when dealing with large sparse matrices.

The Arnoldi method belongs to a class of linear algebra algorithms that give a partial result after a small number of iterations, in contrast to so-called &quot;direct methods&quot; which must complete to give any useful results (see for example, Householder transformation). The partial result in this case being the first few vectors of the basis the algorithm is building.

When applied to Hermitian matrices it reduces to the Lanczos algorithm. The Arnoldi iteration was invented by W. E. Arnoldi in 1951.

==Krylov subspaces and the power iteration==

An intuitive method for finding the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of a given &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix formula_1 is the power iteration: starting with an arbitrary initial vector b, calculate normalizing the result after every application of the matrix &quot;A&quot;. 

This sequence converges to the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue with the largest absolute value, formula_2. However, much potentially useful computation is wasted by using only the final result, formula_3. This suggests that instead, we form the so-called &quot;Krylov matrix&quot;:
:formula_4

The columns of this matrix are not in general orthogonal, but we can extract an orthogonal basis, via a method such as Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization. The resulting set of vectors is thus an orthogonal basis of the &quot;Krylov subspace&quot;, formula_5. We may expect the vectors of this basis to span good approximations of the eigenvectors corresponding to the formula_6 largest eigenvalues, for the same reason that formula_3 approximates the dominant eigenvector.

==The Arnoldi iteration==

The Arnoldi iteration uses the modified Gram–Schmidt process to produce a sequence of orthonormal vectors, &quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, &quot;q&quot;3, ..., called the &quot;Arnoldi vectors&quot;, such that for every &quot;n&quot;, the vectors &quot;q&quot;1, ..., &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; span the Krylov subspace formula_8. Explicitly, the algorithm is as follows:

 Start with an arbitrary vector &quot;q&quot;1 with norm 1.
 Repeat for &quot;k&quot; = 2, 3, ...
 &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; := &quot;A&quot; &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1
 for &quot;j&quot; from 1 to &quot;k&quot; − 1
 &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;−1 := &quot;q&quot;&quot;j&quot;* &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot;
 &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; := &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; − h&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;−1 &quot;q&quot;&quot;j&quot;
 &quot;h&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot;−1 := 
 &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; := &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; / &quot;h&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot;−1

The &quot;j&quot;-loop projects out the component of formula_9 in the directions of formula_10. This ensures the orthogonality of all the generated vectors.

The algorithm breaks down when &quot;q&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the zero vector. This happens when the minimal polynomial of &quot;A&quot; is of degree &quot;k&quot;. In most applications of the Arnoldi iteration, including the eigenvalue algorithm below and GMRES, the algorithm has converged at this point.

Every step of the &quot;k&quot;-loop takes one matrix-vector product and approximately 4&quot;mk&quot; floating point operations.

In the programming language Python with support of the NumPy library:

import numpy as np

def arnoldi_iteration(A, b, n: int):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Compute a basis of the (n + 1)-Krylov subspace of the matrix A.

 This is the space spanned by the vectors {b, Ab, ..., A^n b}.

 Parameters
 A : array_like
 An m × m array.
 b : array_like
 Initial vector (length m).
 n : int
 One less than the dimension of the Krylov subspace, or equivalently the *degree* of the Krylov space. Must be &gt;= 1.
 Returns
 Q : numpy.array
 An m x (n + 1) array, where the columns are an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace.
 h : numpy.array
 An (n + 1) x n array. A on basis Q. It is upper Hessenberg.
 eps = 1e-12
 h = np.zeros((n + 1, n))
 Q = np.zeros((A.shape[0], n + 1))
 # Normalize the input vector
 Q[:, 0] = b / np.linalg.norm(b, 2) # Use it as the first Krylov vector
 for k in range(1, n + 1):
 v = np.dot(A, Q[:, k - 1]) # Generate a new candidate vector
 for j in range(k): # Subtract the projections on previous vectors
 h[j, k - 1] = np.dot(Q[:, j].conj(), v)
 v = v - h[j, k - 1] * Q[:, j]
 h[k, k - 1] = np.linalg.norm(v, 2)
 if h[k, k - 1] &gt; eps: # Add the produced vector to the list, unless
 Q[:, k] = v / h[k, k - 1]
 else: # If that happens, stop iterating.
 return Q, h
 return Q, h
==Properties of the Arnoldi iteration==

Let &quot;Q&quot;&quot;n&quot; denote the &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix formed by the first &quot;n&quot; Arnoldi vectors &quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, ..., &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and let &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the (upper Hessenberg) matrix formed by the numbers &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot; computed by the algorithm:
:formula_11

The orthogonalization method has to be specifically chosen such that the lower Arnoldi/Krylov components are removed from higher Krylov vectors. As formula_12 can be expressed in terms of &quot;q&quot;1, ..., &quot;q&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 by construction, they are orthogonal to &quot;q&quot;&quot;i&quot;+2, ..., &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;, 

We then have

:formula_13

The matrix &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be viewed as &quot;A&quot; in the subspace formula_8 with the Arnoldi vectors as an orthogonal basis; &quot;A&quot; is orthogonally projected onto formula_8. The matrix &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be characterized by the following optimality condition. The characteristic polynomial of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; minimizes ||&quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)&quot;q&quot;1||2 among all monic polynomials of degree &quot;n&quot;. This optimality problem has a unique solution if and only if the Arnoldi iteration does not break down.

The relation between the &quot;Q&quot; matrices in subsequent iterations is given by
:formula_16
where
:formula_17
is an (&quot;n&quot;+1)-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix formed by adding an extra row to &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

==Finding eigenvalues with the Arnoldi iteration==

The idea of the Arnoldi iteration as an eigenvalue algorithm is to compute the eigenvalues in the Krylov subspace. The eigenvalues of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; are called the &quot;Ritz eigenvalues&quot;. Since &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a Hessenberg matrix of modest size, its eigenvalues can be computed efficiently, for instance with the QR algorithm, or somewhat related, Francis&#x27; algorithm. Also Francis&#x27; algorithm itself can be considered to be related to power iterations, operating on nested Krylov subspace. In fact, the most basic form of Francis&#x27; algorithm appears to be to choose &quot;b&quot; to be equal to &quot;Ae&quot;1, and extending &quot;n&quot; to the full dimension of &quot;A&quot;. Improved versions include one or more shifts, and higher powers of &quot;A&quot; may be applied in a single steps.

This is an example of the Rayleigh-Ritz method.

It is often observed in practice that some of the Ritz eigenvalues converge to eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;. Since &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot;, it has at most &quot;n&quot; eigenvalues, and not all eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; can be approximated. Typically, the Ritz eigenvalues converge to the largest eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;. To get the smallest eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;, the inverse (operation) of &quot;A&quot; should be used instead. This can be related to the characterization of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; as the matrix whose characteristic polynomial minimizes ||&quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)&quot;q&quot;1|| in the following way. A good way to get &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) small is to choose the polynomial &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is small whenever &quot;x&quot; is an eigenvalue of &quot;A&quot;. Hence, the zeros of &quot;p&quot; (and thus the Ritz eigenvalues) will be close to the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;.

However, the details are not fully understood yet. This is in contrast to the case where &quot;A&quot; is Hermitian. In that situation, the Arnoldi iteration becomes the Lanczos iteration, for which the theory is more complete.

==Restarted Arnoldi iteration==
Due to practical storage consideration, common implementations of Arnoldi methods typically restart after a fixed number of iterations. One approach is the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) by Lehoucq and Sorensen, which was popularized in the free and open source software package ARPACK. Another approach is the Krylov-Schur Algorithm by G. W. Stewart, which is more stable and simpler to implement than IRAM.

<text>Ward is a small town in Marlborough, New Zealand. It is located on State Highway 1, north of Kaikōura. The Flaxbourne River flows past to the north and into the Pacific Ocean at Ward Beach to the south-east of Ward. A current initiative aims to have the town renamed as Flaxbourne.

==History==

Flaxbourne Station was established in the area around 1847. In 1905, most of the station was subdivided as part of the government&#x27;s land reform, and Ward township was formed. The area was known by the name of the station. On the initiative of Richard Seddon, who was prime minister at the time, the township was named after his friend and political colleague Joseph Ward; a measure that was controversial at the time. The township of Seddon, named after Richard Seddon at the same time, is north of Ward.

In 1961 the population was 218.

As of 2017, there is a campaign to have the town renamed as Flaxbourne. The NZ Geographic Board, i.e. the organisation that has the final say on place names in New Zealand, has advised that the name Ward has never been officially registered.

== Demographics ==
Ward is defined by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the larger Awatere statistical area.
Ward had a population of 81 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 27 people (−25.0%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 21 people (−20.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 36 households, comprising 45 males and 33 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.36 males per female. The median age was 51.0 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 12 people (14.8%) aged under 15 years, 6 (7.4%) aged 15 to 29, 42 (51.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 21 (25.9%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 88.9% European/Pākehā, 22.2% Māori, and 3.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

59.3% had no religion, and 40.7% were Christian.

Of those at least 15 years old, 6 (8.7%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 15 (21.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $29,100, compared with $31,800 nationally. 6 people (8.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 42 (60.9%) people were employed full-time, and 12 (17.4%) were part-time.

==Education==
Ward School is a coeducational full primary (years 1–8) school with a roll of as of A celebration to mark 100 years of schooling in the area was held in 2006.

The nearest secondary schools are Marlborough Boys&#x27; College and Marlborough Girls&#x27; College, both away in Blenheim.

<text>Deloraine is an unincorporated urban community in the Municipality of Deloraine – Winchester within the Canadian province of Manitoba that held town status prior to January 1, 2015. It is situated near the Turtle Mountains in the southwestern corner of the province. Located in the Westman Region, the community is south of Brandon. Deloraine originally incorporated as a village in 1904 and then as a town in 1907. Its town status was relinquished in 2015 when it amalgamated with the Rural Municipality of Winchester.

Deloraine is named after a village in Roxburghshire, Scotland.

== History ==
The area of Deloraine was originally home to the Assiniboine and the later the Hunkpapa, whose lives were centred around the plains bison herds. A town site was erected in 1883 along the Boundary Commission Trail and a post office was built in the general store by postmaster James Cavers, which he named Deloraine after the district in Scotland from where he emigrated from, and so the town would get its name.

The railway arrived north of the old town site in 1884 as part of the Canadian Pacific Railway and by 1886, ran from Deloraine, to Boissevain and then eastward to La Riviere. As the railway ran westward from Boissevain, the decision was made to move the town site from its old site along the Boundary Commission Trail to the present location alongside the railway. The move was made over the period of a month in late 1886 when merchants, millers, blacksmiths, implement dealers, and the post office, all moved to take up lots at the new northern town site. Deloraine immediately replaced Boissevain as the grain shipping centre of southwestern Manitoba, taking grain shipments from as far away as Carnduff. Passenger train service also took place on a train called the &#x27;Blue Flea&#x27; which ran along a line from Lyleton at the United States border, to Deloraine, and terminating at Lauder. Passenger service was directed to the major centre of Winnipeg through Lyleton.

The federal government&#x27;s efforts to settle the area led many Belgian settlers to arrive in 1888 and in even greater numbers in 1892. By 1893 the land office closed its doors as the efforts to settle the area were completed. In 1897 the local methodist congregation got together and decided to build a new church, and in 1897 the church was constructed. The large building endured for many years but was destroyed by fire in 1951 and replaced with a new structure. A second church, the Deloraine Presbyterian Church was also constructed beginning in 1896 and completed a year later, it still stands today. Deloraine incorporated as a village on March 1, 1904 and then incorporated as a town on May 1, 1907. Mennonite settlers arrived in the area in 1920, on properties south and east of the town. Chinese Canadians were also long a part of the town, primarily working in the restaurant and laundry sectors.

The Deloraine Agricultural Society had formed in 1888 and a fair grounds created, the agricultural society created a half-mile track which hosted harness racing. In 1928 a grand stand was built on the site as the post-war popularity of the fairs and races spiked when they were restarted following World War I. Like many prairie communities, Deloraine was profoundly and negatively affected by the Great Depression. The community did see some growth in this decade through stimulus efforts when the Canadian government built the new Dominion Post Office Building in 1930. The community endured the decade until better times both economically and environmentally returned around 1939.

Like many small towns and cities across the country, Deloraine was profoundly impacted by World War II. In the early years of the war, many funds were raised and victory bonds and victory loans were sold to support the war efforts in Europe. Victory Loan Campaigns in Deloraine began in 1941, a second and third in 1942. As the war proceeded, many homes in 1944 were emptier as servicemen were away fighting the war in England, Belgium, and France. In spring of 1945 as end of the war was anticipated, a celebration was planned. With the arrival of VE Day on May 7 and large celebration of victory and peace began. 31 local schools and 1,000 students took part in a large Field Day in Deloraine, led by a band from Shilo Camp, the parade colours were carried by local servicemen, led by local war hero Peter Engbrecht of Whitewater, Manitoba.

As part of Manitoba&#x27;s municipal amalgamation initiative, the Town of Deloraine amalgamated with the Rural Municipality of Winchester on January 1, 2015 to become the Municipality of Deloraine – Winchester.

==Geography==
Deloraine is located on the western shore of Whitewater Lake a brackish lake located in the endorheic basin that drastically fluctuates its water levels based on precipitation cycles. Just south of the community lie the Turtle Mountains, a plateau that rises above the surrounding countryside. The Manitoba side of the plateau is protected by a provincial park, Turtle Mountain Provincial Park, which is approximately in size.

=== Climate ===
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Deloraine had a population of 962 living in 441 of its 490 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 978. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Infrastructure==
===Water===
Water was needed in the early days of the community and drilling took place using the power of steam engines and locomotives, including the Countess of Dufferin. Eventually water was struck at though it was of poor and salty quality. After the dry years of the 1930s, a water reservoir was constructed a few miles southeast of the town on the Turtlehead Creek, near the present day Deloraine Golf Course. The reservoir and the pipe connection to the town was completed in 1963 when the community had a reliable source of potable water. Sewage lagoons were constructed at the east end of the community and treated sewage then flows north and east into Whitewater Lake.

<doc id="1134621" wikidata="Q4767612" url="?curid=1134621" title="Anna Wickham">
<text>Anna Wickham was the pseudonym of Edith Alice Mary Harper (1883 – 1 May 1947), an English/Australian poet who was a pioneer of modernist poetry, and one of the most important female poets writing during the first half of the twentieth century. She was friend to other important writers of the time, such as D. H. Lawrence, George Bernard Shaw, Katherine Mansfield and Dylan Thomas. Wickham also lived a transnational, unconventional life, moving between Australia, England and France. She is remembered as a modernist figure and feminist writer, one who did not command sustained critical attention in her lifetime, though her poetry did earn her a major reputation at the time of writing and had been frequently anthologised. Wickham&#x27;s literary reputation has improved since her death and she is now regarded as an important early 20th-century woman writer.

==Early life==
She was born in Wimbledon, London, and brought up in Australia, mostly in Brisbane and Sydney. Her pen-names imply an Australian self-identification: &quot;Wickham&quot; was adopted after a Brisbane street. She had used &quot;John Oland&quot; for her first collection, which alludes to the Jenolan Caves in New South Wales.

Wickham returned to London in 1904, where she took singing lessons and won a drama scholarship (at the future RADA, just founded). She pursued her singing in Paris in 1905 with Jean de Reszke, the Polish tenor.

In 1906 she married Patrick Hepburn, a City of London solicitor with interests in Romanesque architecture, and later astronomy. They had four sons. They lived first in central London, then in family houses in Hampstead: Downshire Hill, from 1909, and then from 1919 a house on Parliament Hill which would be her permanent home.

Wickham became involved in the contemporary philanthropic movement concerned with maternal care, at St Pancras Hospital.

==Career and strife==
Wickham&#x27;s first collection, &quot;Songs by John Oland&quot;, was published in 1911 under the eponymous male pseudonym, and presented a particular focus on the conflict between men and women, depicted in such poems as &quot;Song of the Low-Caste Wife&quot;, &quot;Surrender&quot; and &quot;Divorce&quot;. Other subjects included the ambition to be a writer, a post-Darwin loss of religious faith, and motherhood. According to Wickham&#x27;s autobiographical writings, collected in &quot;The Writings of Anna Wickham: Free Woman and Poet&quot;, as well as a biography by Jennifer Vaughan Jones, Patrick Hepburn was vehemently opposed to Wickham&#x27;s writing and prone to tyrannical rages. In 1911, he had her committed to a private asylum, on the basis that her belief that she was a poet was evidence of her insanity. Wickham remained at the psychiatric hospital for a period of about six weeks. According to Jennifer Vaughan Jones, the crisis was specifically precipitated by a poem Wickham had relayed to Hepburn, entitled &quot;Nervous Prostration&quot;, which includes the lines: 

I married a man of the Croydon class

When I was twenty-two.

And I vex him, and he bores me

Till we don&#x27;t know what to do!

Yet, writes Jennifer Vaughan Jones, at the asylum a doctor asked Wickham to recite &quot;Nervous Prostration&quot; to him, and was sufficiently impressed that he found her a pen and paper and encouraged her to continue with her writing. 

Given the complexities of Wickham&#x27;s emotional life at the time, including having birthed four children and suffered two miscarriages, along with domestic conflicts with her husband, there may have been other factors at play. However, this sort of sustained hostility was experienced by many pioneering women writers of the time. As Wickham wrote in a poem &quot;Dedication to a Cook&quot;:

If any ask why there’s no great She-Poet,

Let him come live with me, and he will know it.

If I’d indite an ode or mend a sonnet,

I must go choose a dish or tie a bonnet….

During World War I Wickham met the poet and publishing impresario Harold Monro at his Poetry Bookshop. He encouraged her writing, and she published a second collection in 1915. This was the beginning of a thirty-year period during which she mixed with literati in London (and later in Paris). She became involved in bohemian circles, and achieved recognition among her peers. The poet and critic Louis Untermeyer described her as &quot;a woman, who always entered a room as if she had just stamped across the moors.” George Orwell, a neighbour of Wickham&#x27;s in the 1930s, described Wickham as “ferocious looking.”

During World War I Patrick Hepburn spent time away from home, joining the RNAS. During this time, Anna struck up a friendship with D. H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda. Her relations with the novelist Eliot Bliss are said to have been intimate.

Her third son Richard died of scarlet fever aged four. She spent a period in the early 1920s in Paris, after his death, to recuperate. There she developed a passion for Natalie Barney. It was not returned in the same way, but they sustained a correspondence (later published as &quot;Postcards and Poems&quot;). She met some leading Paris figures in anglophone modernism of the time.

It is believed that her marriage was in crisis during 1926, and she was separated from her husband until 1928, though they reunited shortly before his death in an accident, on holiday, in 1929.

During the 1930s she was well-known in literary London, and wrote a great deal of poetry (much of which was later lost in war damage) and much of which remained unpublished. She did find support from the somewhat &quot;louche&quot; John Gawsworth, who in 1936 put out a Richards Press collection of her work. An extended autobiographical essay &quot;Prelude to a Spring Clean&quot; dates from 1935. That was the year in which she supported the just-married Dylan Thomas and Caitlin, and then quarrelled with them - allegedly throwing Dylan Thomas out of her house during a snowstorm. 

In 1947, she committed suicide by hanging in her home in Hampstead. She left behind thousands of unpublished poems.

<doc id="1134624" wikidata="Q551509" url="?curid=1134624" title="SS Thielbek (1940)">
<text>Thielbek was a cargo steamship that was built in Germany in 1940, sunk in an air raid in 1945, refloated in 1949 and repaired, and was in service until 1974. Lübecker Maschinenbau Gesellschaft in Lübeck built her in 1940 for the Knöhr and Burchard shipping company of Hamburg. In 1961 Knöhr and Burchard sold her to buyers who renamed her &quot;Magdalene&quot; and registered her in Panama. In 1965 she was renamed &quot;Old Warrior&quot;. She was scrapped in Yugoslavia in 1974.

&quot;Thielbek&quot; is notable for having been sunk by RAF aircraft on 3 May 1945, killing 2,750 people aboard. She was at anchor in the Bay of Lübeck with the passenger ships and the , which were sunk in the same air raid. At the time &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; and &quot;Thielbek&quot; were crowded with prisoners from the Neuengamme, Stutthof, and Mittelbau-Dora concentration camps.

Under Allied interrogation, the commander of the Gestapo in Hamburg later revealed that the prisoners were to be killed, possibly by scuttling the ships with the prisoners still aboard.

==Background==
On 17 April 1945 &quot;Thielbek&quot; was told she was to prepare for a &quot;special operation&quot;. The next day the SS summoned &quot;Thielbek&quot;″s Captain John Jacobsen, and &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;″s Captain Heinrich Bertram to a conference at which they were ordered to embark concentration camp prisoners. Both captains refused, and Jacobsen was relieved of his command.

The order to transfer the prisoners from the camps to the prison ships came from Hamburg Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann, who in turn was acting on orders from Berlin. Kaufmann later claimed during a War Crimes Tribunal that the prisoners were destined for Sweden, but at the same trial Georg-Henning Graf von Bassewitz-Behr, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF) of Hamburg, said that the prisoners were in fact to be killed on Himmler&#x27;s orders.

Embarkation of prisoners began on 20 April, with the Swedish Red Cross present. The ship&#x27;s water supply was insufficient for so many people and 20 to 30 prisoners died daily. The prisoners, with the exception of political prisoners, remained aboard for two or three days before being transferred to &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; by the cargo ship .

==Sinking==

Between the two attacks on &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, nine Hawker Typhoon aircraft of No. 198 Squadron RAF stationed at Plantlünne attacked &quot;Thielbek&quot; and &quot;Deutschland&quot;, five aircraft firing rockets at &quot;Deutschland&quot; and 4 at &quot;Thielbek&quot;. Numerous cannon shells and 32 rockets were fired at &quot;Thielbek&quot;. She caught fire, developed a 30 degree list to starboard, and sank 20 minutes after being attacked. Of the 2,800 prisoners aboard &quot;Thielbek&quot;, only 50 survived the attack.

==Subsequent career==
In 1949, four years after her sinking, &quot;Thielbek&quot; was refloated. Human remains found aboard her were buried in the &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; cemetery at Neustadt in Holstein. She remained in Knöhr and Burchard service until 1961 when she was sold, renamed &quot;Magdalene&quot;, and registered under the Panamanian flag of convenience. In 1965 she was renamed &quot;Old Warrior&quot;. She was scrapped in Split, Yugoslavia, in 1974.

<text>Lowell Liebermann (born February 22, 1961, in New York City) is an American composer, pianist and conductor.

==Life and career==
At the age of sixteen, Liebermann performed at Carnegie Hall, playing his Piano Sonata, op. 1. He studied at the Juilliard School of Music with David Diamond and Vincent Persichetti, earning bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees. The English composer-pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji also expressed interest in Liebermann&#x27;s early work, having critiqued the young composer&#x27;s Piano Sonata in a private exchange between the two; Liebermann&#x27;s Concerto for Piano, op. 12 would be dedicated to Sorabji.

His most recorded works are his Sonata for Flute and Piano (1987), &quot;Gargoyles&quot; for piano (1989), and his Concerto for Flute and Orchestra (1992). Other notable works include a sonata for flute and guitar (1988), five cello sonatas (most recently 2019) the second piano concerto (1992), the opera &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1996), a second symphony (2000), a trumpet concerto (2000), a violin concerto (2001), &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; for piano and orchestra (2001), and the opera &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; (2006) which was commissioned as part of the festivities surrounding the centennial of the Juilliard School. He was also commissioned by the Dranoff International Two Piano Foundation to compose &quot;Three Lullabies&quot; for two pianos. Opus Two recorded an album of all of Liebermann&#x27;s chamber music, &quot;Chamber Music of Lowell Liebermann&quot; with guest artists Andrés Díaz, Erika Eckert, and the Ying Quartet (Albany Records, TROY684 2004)

Liebermann has also written the music for the ballet &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, a co-production between The Royal Ballet and San Francisco Ballet (2016). A recording of the work&#x27;s Premier was released in 2021 on the audiophile label Reference Recordings.

His music combines elements of traditional tonality and structure with more adventurous harmonies. Liebermann&#x27;s music is often highly polytonal and Liebermann explores different bitonal possibilities in many of his pieces. His Concerto for Piccolo and Orchestra, Concerto for Flute and Orchestra, and Concerto for Flute, Harp and Orchestra have been recorded by James Galway. American clarinetist Jon Manasse premiered his Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra (2009) with The Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Neal Gittleman.

Liebermann resides in New York City. He presently serves on the composition faculty at Mannes College The New School for Music and is the director of the Mannes American Composers Ensemble.

<text>Michael Marks (; ; 1859? – 31 December 1907) was a Polish-Jewish entrepreneur and later a British businessman, who with Thomas Spencer co-founded the retail chain Marks &amp; Spencer.

==Biography==
Marks was born into a Polish Ashkenazi Jewish family in Słonim, in what was then the multinational Russian Empire (now Grodno Region, Belarus). He immigrated to Britain around 1882 and moved to Leeds, where a company called Barran was known to employ Jewish immigrants. He married Hannah Cohen at the Great Synagogue on Belgrave Street, Leeds, in 1886. There appears to be some confusion regarding this event. According to his naturalisation papers his marriage took place in 1859, but this does not tally against the age given on his marriage certificate, which suggests the wedding took place later, perhaps 1863 or 1864.

Marks met Isaac Dewhirst, the owner of a Leeds warehouse, in 1884. A deal was arranged, whereby Marks agreed to buy goods from Dewhirst and sell them in nearby villages. The venture was a success and enabled Marks to raise enough capital to establish a stall in Leeds&#x27; open market. At his stall, he used the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask the Price – it&#x27;s a Penny&quot;. He also sold goods at Castleford and Wakefield markets.

Marks also made the decision to rent an area at the new covered market in Leeds, which traded six days of the week. Over the next few years, Marks expanded his business and opened similar stalls in covered market halls all over Yorkshire and Lancashire.

===Marks &amp; Spencer===
In 1894 Marks decided that if he was to expand the business further, he would need a business partner. He initially approached Isaac Dewhirst, who decided against the offer but suggested that his cashier Thomas Spencer might be interested. Spencer decided that the £300 () required for a half-share in the business would be a good investment.

The running of the business was split between Spencer, who managed the office and warehouse, and Marks, who continued to run the market stalls. Spencer had developed some important contacts while working for Isaac Dewhirst, and these allowed him to get the best prices for goods by dealing directly with the manufacturers. Together, Spencer and Marks were able to open stores in Manchester, Birmingham Liverpool Middlesbrough, Sheffield, Bristol, Hull Sunderland and Cardiff.

A new warehouse in Manchester was built in 1897. This store became the centre of an enterprise that, by then, included thirty-six branches. New stores had been built in Bradford, Leicester, Northampton, Preston, and Swansea. London had a total of seven branches. On 5 May 1897 Marks was naturalised as a British subject.

In 1903 Marks &amp; Spencer became a limited company. Spencer&#x27;s original £300 investment had grown to a value of £15,000 () and he retired later that year. Michael Marks continued to develop the business until his death at Knolls House, 396 Bury New Road, Salford, on 31 December 1907. He was buried in the Old Jewish cemetery (Hebrew Congregation), Crumpsall, in plot number 1917, on 2 January 1908.

In 1928 long after the death of Marks, his son Simon Marks, later the first Baron Marks of Broughton, laid the foundations for a long tradition. He introduced the &quot;St Michael&quot; brand name in honour of his father, which remained in use until 2000.

<text>Renette Pauline Soutendijk (born 21 May 1957), known professionally as Renée Soutendijk (), is a Dutch actress. A gymnast in her youth, Soutendijk began her acting career in the late 1970s. She was a favorite star of director Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s films, and is perhaps best known for her work in his 1980 release &quot;Spetters&quot; and 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Fourth Man&quot;. Her good looks and striking blond hair secured her status as a Dutch sex symbol in the 1980s.

Soutendijk attempted to establish herself in the United States in the late 1980s, and appeared in the science fiction film &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; (1991). Since the 2000s she has played a number of television and stage roles, and appeared as one of the leads in the 2012 RTL 4 television series &quot;Moordvrouw&quot;. She has also had supporting roles in the American drama &quot;A Perfect Man&quot; (2013) and in Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s &quot;Suspiria&quot; (2018).

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Soutendijk was born in The Hague, Netherlands, on 21 May 1957. In her youth, Soutendijk was a qualifying Olympic gymnast. She studied acting at the Academy for Podium Formation in The Hague.

===Television and film beginnings===
Soutendijk made her television debut in the Dutch television series &quot;Dagboek van een herdershond&quot; (English: &quot;Dutch the Shepherd Dog&quot; (1979–1980). She began her film career playing the heroines in the Paul Verhoeven-directed cult films &quot;Spetters&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Fourth Man&quot; (1983). &quot;Spetters&quot; established her as a sex symbol; the movie and its star attracted attention in the United States as well, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; saw her &quot;stylish performance&quot; of a &quot;compelling character&quot; as a focal point of the movie. In the early 1980s, Soutendijk, Monique van de Ven, and Willeke van Ammelrooy were the three best-known actresses in Dutch cinema, and most Dutch movies featured one of the three. The movie that marked her breakthrough as an actress in a major role, though, is considered to be &quot;The Girl with the Red Hair&quot; (1981), in which she played Dutch resistance fighter Hannie Schaft. From 1981 to 1989 she played in &quot;Zeg &#x27;ns Aaa&quot;, one of the longest-running and most popular Dutch sitcoms. In 1983, Soutendijk gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Caro.
Soutendijk&#x27;s first English-language role was as Eva Braun in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;. Her subsequent TV movie roles included Anna Mons in &quot;Peter the Great&quot; (1986) and Mrs. Simon Wiesenthal in &quot;Murderers Among Us&quot; (1989). She sought a career in Hollywood and lived in the United States for a year and a half. She played opposite Academy Award nominee Chris Sarandon in the Holocaust-themed movie &quot;Forced March&quot; (1989), and the title character in &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; (1991), in which she portrayed an android opposite Gregory Hines.

In the late 1990s she played in another Dutch film (&quot;De Flat&quot;). She also acted in German television movies (and series, including &quot;Tatort&quot;) in which, she said, she was rarely typecast and played more interesting characters. In 1996, she gave birth to her son, Jaïr. The films &quot;Dial 9&quot; and &quot;Met grote blijdschap&quot; (&quot;With Great Joy&quot;), which were both released in 2001, marked her return to the Dutch movie-screen after a four-year absence.

===2000s and later career===
Soutendijk subsequently played roles in television shows and as a stage actress, playing for instance Queen Juliana (2006) and a woman dying of cancer in Margaret Edson&#x27;s &quot;Wit&quot; (2010). In 2011, Soutendijk was given the Rembrandt Award for her body of work. That same year, news came that Soutendijk was to star in a television series for RTL 4, &quot;Moordvrouw&quot;, a police drama. In 2018, Soutendijk had a supporting role in Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s &quot;Suspiria&quot;, a reimagining of the Dario Argento film of the same name.

She appeared in the 2022 photography game show &quot;Het perfecte plaatje&quot;.

In September 2023 Soutendijk was the recipient of Golden Calf for Best Leading Role (the most important Dutch film award) for her main role in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;.

<text>In coding theory, block codes are a large and important family of error-correcting codes that encode data in blocks.
There is a vast number of examples for block codes, many of which have a wide range of practical applications. The abstract definition of block codes is conceptually useful because it allows coding theorists, mathematicians, and computer scientists to study the limitations of &quot;all&quot; block codes in a unified way.
Such limitations often take the form of &quot;bounds&quot; that relate different parameters of the block code to each other, such as its rate and its ability to detect and correct errors.

Examples of block codes are Reed–Solomon codes, Hamming codes, Hadamard codes, Expander codes, Golay codes, Reed–Muller codes and Polar codes. These examples also belong to the class of linear codes, and hence they are called linear block codes. More particularly, these codes are known as algebraic block codes, or cyclic block codes, because they can be generated using Boolean polynomials.

Algebraic block codes are typically hard-decoded using algebraic decoders.

The term &quot;block code&quot; may also refer to any error-correcting code that acts on a block of formula_1 bits of input data to produce formula_2 bits of output data formula_3. Consequently, the block coder is a &quot;memoryless&quot; device. Under this definition codes such as turbo codes, terminated convolutional codes and other iteratively decodable codes (turbo-like codes) would also be considered block codes. A non-terminated convolutional encoder would be an example of a non-block (unframed) code, which has &quot;memory&quot; and is instead classified as a &quot;tree code&quot;.

This article deals with &quot;algebraic block codes&quot;.

== The block code and its parameters ==

Error-correcting codes are used to reliably transmit digital data over unreliable communication channels subject to channel noise.
When a sender wants to transmit a possibly very long data stream using a block code, the sender breaks the stream up into pieces of some fixed size. Each such piece is called &quot;message&quot; and the procedure given by the block code encodes each message individually into a codeword, also called a &quot;block&quot; in the context of block codes. The sender then transmits all blocks to the receiver, who can in turn use some decoding mechanism to (hopefully) recover the original messages from the possibly corrupted received blocks.
The performance and success of the overall transmission depends on the parameters of the channel and the block code.

Formally, a block code is an injective mapping
:formula_4.
Here, formula_5 is a finite and nonempty set and formula_1 and formula_2 are integers. The meaning and significance of these three parameters and other parameters related to the code are described below.

=== The alphabet Σ ===
The data stream to be encoded is modeled as a string over some alphabet formula_5. The size formula_9 of the alphabet is often written as formula_10. If formula_11, then the block code is called a &quot;binary&quot; block code. In many applications it is useful to consider formula_10 to be a prime power, and to identify formula_5 with the finite field formula_14.

=== The message length &quot;k&quot; ===
Messages are elements formula_15 of formula_16, that is, strings of length formula_1.
Hence the number formula_1 is called the message length or dimension of a block code.

=== The block length &quot;n&quot; ===
The block length formula_2 of a block code is the number of symbols in a block. Hence, the elements formula_20 of formula_21 are strings of length formula_2 and correspond to blocks that may be received by the receiver. Hence they are also called received words.
If formula_23 for some message formula_15, then formula_20 is called the codeword of formula_15.

=== The rate &quot;R&quot; ===
The rate of a block code is defined as the ratio between its message length and its block length:
:formula_27.
A large rate means that the amount of actual message per transmitted block is high. In this sense, the rate measures the transmission speed and the quantity formula_28 measures the overhead that occurs due to the encoding with the block code.
It is a simple information theoretical fact that the rate cannot exceed formula_29 since data cannot in general be losslessly compressed. Formally, this follows from the fact that the code formula_30 is an injective map.

=== The distance &quot;d&quot; ===
The distance or minimum distance of a block code is the minimum number of positions in which any two distinct codewords differ, and the relative distance formula_31 is the fraction formula_32.
Formally, for received words formula_33, let formula_34 denote the Hamming distance between formula_35 and formula_36, that is, the number of positions in which formula_35 and formula_36 differ.
Then the minimum distance formula_39 of the code formula_30 is defined as
:formula_41.
Since any code has to be injective, any two codewords will disagree in at least one position, so the distance of any code is at least formula_29. Besides, the distance equals the minimum weight for linear block codes because:
:formula_43.

A larger distance allows for more error correction and detection.
For example, if we only consider errors that may change symbols of the sent codeword but never erase or add them, then the number of errors is the number of positions in which the sent codeword and the received word differ.
A code with distance allows the receiver to detect up to formula_44 transmission errors since changing formula_44 positions of a codeword can never accidentally yield another codeword. Furthermore, if no more than formula_46 transmission errors occur, the receiver can uniquely decode the received word to a codeword. This is because every received word has at most one codeword at distance formula_46. If more than formula_46 transmission errors occur, the receiver cannot uniquely decode the received word in general as there might be several possible codewords. One way for the receiver to cope with this situation is to use list decoding, in which the decoder outputs a list of all codewords in a certain radius.

=== Popular notation ===
The notation formula_49 describes a block code over an alphabet formula_5 of size formula_10, with a block length formula_2, message length formula_1, and distance formula_39.
If the block code is a linear block code, then the square brackets in the notation formula_55 are used to represent that fact.
For binary codes with formula_11, the index is sometimes dropped.
For maximum distance separable codes, the distance is always formula_57, but sometimes the precise distance is not known, non-trivial to prove or state, or not needed. In such cases, the formula_39-component may be missing.

Sometimes, especially for non-block codes, the notation formula_59 is used for codes that contain formula_60 codewords of length formula_2. For block codes with messages of length formula_1 over an alphabet of size formula_10, this number would be formula_64.

== Examples ==

As mentioned above, there are a vast number of error-correcting codes that are actually block codes.
The first error-correcting code was the Hamming(7,4) code, developed by Richard W. Hamming in 1950. This code transforms a message consisting of 4 bits into a codeword of 7 bits by adding 3 parity bits. Hence this code is a block code. It turns out that it is also a linear code and that it has distance 3. In the shorthand notation above, this means that the Hamming(7,4) code is a formula_65 code.

Reed–Solomon codes are a family of formula_55 codes with formula_57 and formula_10 being a prime power. Rank codes are family of formula_55 codes with formula_70. Hadamard codes are a family of formula_71 codes with formula_72 and formula_73.

== Error detection and correction properties ==

A codeword formula_74could be considered as a point in the formula_2-dimension space formula_21 and the code formula_77 is the subset of formula_21. A code formula_77 has distance formula_39 means that formula_81, there is no other codeword in the Hamming ball centered at formula_20 with radius formula_44, which is defined as the collection of formula_2-dimension words whose &quot;Hamming distance&quot; to formula_20 is no more than formula_44. Similarly, formula_87 with (minimum) distance formula_39 has the following properties:
* formula_87 can detect formula_44 errors : Because a codeword formula_20 is the only codeword in the Hamming ball centered at itself with radius formula_44, no error pattern of formula_44 or fewer errors could change one codeword to another. When the receiver detects that the received vector is not a codeword of formula_87, the errors are detected (but no guarantee to correct).
* formula_87 can correct formula_96. 
Let formula_97 be the maximum number of codewords in a Hamming ball of radius for any code formula_98 of distance .

Then we have the &quot;Johnson Bound&quot; : formula_99, if formula_100

=== Elias–Bassalygo bound ===

: formula_101

== Sphere packings and lattices ==

Block codes are tied to the sphere packing problem which has received some attention over the years. In two dimensions, it is easy to visualize. Take a bunch of pennies flat on the table and push them together. The result is a hexagon pattern like a bee&#x27;s nest. But block codes rely on more dimensions which cannot easily be visualized. The powerful Golay code used in deep space communications uses 24 dimensions. If used as a binary code (which it usually is), the dimensions refer to the length of the codeword as defined above.

The theory of coding uses the &quot;N&quot;-dimensional sphere model. For example, how many pennies can be packed into a circle on a tabletop or in 3 dimensions, how many marbles can be packed into a globe. Other considerations enter the choice of a code. For example, hexagon packing into the constraint of a rectangular box will leave empty space at the corners. As the dimensions get larger, the percentage of empty space grows smaller. But at certain dimensions, the packing uses all the space and these codes are the so-called perfect codes. There are very few of these codes.

Another property is the number of neighbors a single codeword may have. 
Again, consider pennies as an example. First we pack the pennies in a rectangular grid. Each penny will have 4 near neighbors (and 4 at the corners which are farther away). In a hexagon, each penny will have 6 near neighbors. Respectively, in three and four dimensions, the maximum packing is given by the 12-face and 24-cell with 12 and 24 neighbors, respectively. When we increase the dimensions, the number of near neighbors increases very rapidly. In general, the value is given by the kissing numbers.

The result is that the number of ways for noise to make the receiver choose
a neighbor (hence an error) grows as well. This is a fundamental limitation
of block codes, and indeed all codes. It may be harder to cause an error to
a single neighbor, but the number of neighbors can be large enough so the
total error probability actually suffers.

<text>Clifford Vivian Devon Curtis (born July 27, 1968) is a New Zealand actor and film producer. After working in theatre, he made his film debut in Jane Campion&#x27;s Oscar-winning film &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993), followed by a breakout role in the drama &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; (1994). He has won four New Zealand Film Awards, Best Actor for &quot;Jubilee&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Dark Horse&quot; (2014) - which also earned him the Asia Pacific Screen Award - and Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot; (1993) and &quot;Whale Rider&quot; (2002).

Curtis&#x27; international film credits include &quot;Three Kings&quot;, &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Blow&quot; , &quot;Training Day&quot; (both 2001), &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; (2002), &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; (both 2007), &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;Crossing Over&quot; (both 2009), &quot;Colombiana&quot; (2011), and &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; (2019), also portraying James &quot;Mac&quot; Mackreides in &quot;The Meg&quot; (2018) and &quot;Meg 2: The Trench&quot; (2023) and Tonowari in &quot;&quot; (2022) and the upcoming &quot;&quot; (2025). 

He had television series roles on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Trauma&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Body of Proof&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot;. From 2015 to 2017, he portrayed Travis Manawa on the AMC horror drama series &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot;. Curtis is also the co-owner of the independent New Zealand production company Whenua Films.

==Early life==
Curtis was born in Rotorua in 1968. He is one of eight children born to George Curtis, an amateur dancer. He is of Māori descent; his tribal affiliations are Te Arawa and Ngāti Hauiti. His uncle was Toby Curtis, a prominent Māori educator and leader.

As a boy he studied mau rākau, a traditional Māori form of taiaha fighting, with Māori elder Mita Mohi on Mokoia Island, which nurtured his abilities as a performer in kapa haka. Curtis later performed as a breakdancer and competitively in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll dance competitions. He received his secondary education at Edmund Rice College, Rotorua. Curtis graduated from Toi Whakaari in 1989 with a Diploma in Acting.

==Career==
===New Zealand===
Curtis started acting in amateur productions of musicals &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; with the Kapiti Players and the Mantis Cooperative Theatre Company, before attending the New Zealand Drama School and Teatro Dimitri Scuola in Switzerland. He worked at a number of New Zealand theatre companies, including Downstage, Mercury Theatre, Bats Theatre, and Centre Point. His stage roles include &quot;Happy End&quot;, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, &quot;Weeds&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Serious Money&quot;, and &quot;The End of the Golden Weather&quot;.

His first feature film role was a small part in the Oscar-nominated Jane Campion film &quot;The Piano&quot;. He went on to win attention in &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, one of the most successful films released on New Zealand screens; the line &quot;Uncle fucken Bully&quot; referring to Curtis&#x27;s character spoken by &quot;Jake the Muss&quot;, played by Temuera Morrison, became one of New Zealand film&#x27;s most memorable and quoted lines, as well as being part of the &quot;Kiwiana&quot; trend. He played Kahu in the short-film &quot;Kahu &amp; Maia&quot;, a contemporary depiction of a Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāti Rongomaiwahine legend. He played a seducer in the melodrama &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot;. In 2000 Curtis starred as family man Billy Williams in &quot;Jubilee&quot;, before playing father to the lead character in the international hit &quot;Whale Rider&quot;.

In 2004 with producer Ainsley Gardiner, Curtis formed independent film production company Whenua Films. The goals of the company are to support the growth of the New Zealand indigenous film-making scene, and support local short filmmakers. He and Gardiner were appointed to manage the development and production of films for the Short Films Fund for 2005–06 by the New Zealand Film Commission. They have produced several shorts under the new company banner, notably &quot;Two Cars, One Night&quot;, which received an Academy Award nomination in 2005, and &quot;Hawaikii&quot; by director Mike Jonathan in 2006. Both short films circulated through many of the prestigious international film festivals like the Berlinale.

At the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, Miramax Films bought US distribution rights to relationship comedy &quot;Eagle vs Shark&quot;, the first feature film directed by Taika Waititi. Waititi&#x27;s follow-up feature &quot;Boy&quot;, also from Whenua Films, went on to become the highest grossing New Zealand film released.

In 2014, Curtis played the lead role in &quot;The Dark Horse&quot;, which the National Radio review called &quot;one of the greatest New Zealand films ever made.&quot; The &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; praised him for his &quot;towering performance&quot; as real-life Gisborne speed chess player and coach Genesis Potini, who died in 2011. Curtis studied chess and deliberately put on weight for the role.

===International===

Curtis has appeared in the films Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999), &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), the drug drama &quot;Blow&quot; (2001) with Johnny Depp, &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001), &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; (2002) with Arnold Schwarzenegger, &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; (2007), &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007), &quot;Push&quot; (2009), “10,000 B.C.” (2008) the re-make, and &quot;Colombiana&quot; (2011). In M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; (2010), he played the main villain, Fire Lord Ozai. Curtis portrayed Lt. Cortez in the film &quot;Last Knights&quot; (2015) and Jesus Christ in the film &quot;Risen&quot; (2016).

In the NBC TV drama &quot;Trauma&quot;, he played daredevil flight medic Reuben &quot;Rabbit&quot; Palchuck. Curtis was cast as Travis Manawa, a leading male role of the AMC TV series &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot;, the spin-off of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

In 2017, Curtis was cast as Tonowari and is set to appear in the four sequels to &quot;Avatar&quot;, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 2019, he played Jonah Hobbs, the brother of Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw&quot;; their characters are Samoan.

Curtis stars in &quot;True Spirit&quot; alongside Teagan Croft and Anna Paquin&quot;.&quot; It began airing on Netflix on 3 February 2023. The movie is based on the journey of Jessica Watson, a 16-year-old Australian sailor attempting a solo global circumnavigation. In 2024, Curtis starred in the Netflix series &quot;Kaos&quot; in the role of the Greek God Poseidon.

==Personal life==
He was married in late 2009 in a private ceremony at his home, and has four children. He is Roman Catholic.

When asked about being an &quot;all-purpose ethnic&quot; actor, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s been a real advantage, I love being ethnic, I love the colour of my skin. There are limitations in the business, that&#x27;s a reality, but I&#x27;ve been given such wonderful opportunities.&quot;

<doc id="1134663" wikidata="Q262553" url="?curid=1134663" title="Drama of Exile">
<text>Drama of Exile is the fifth studio album by German musician Nico. The album was initially released in 1981 and re-recorded in 1983 as The Drama of Exile. The album featured a Middle Eastern rhythm section and was produced by Corsican bassist Philippe Quilichini. The release is Nico&#x27;s only studio album to not feature John Cale.

== Background ==
After the release of &quot;The End...&quot; in 1974, Nico&#x27;s partnership with Island Records ended, and for the next year, she spent the majority of her time in New York City without a recording contract. During that time, she appeared in a series of Philippe Garrel films.

Nico continued to write new songs and perform intermittently. &quot;Purple Lips,&quot; featured in her solo sets as early as March 1975, was also performed on French television in April 1975. The lyrics of the song were recited by Nico in the Philippe Garrel film, &quot;Le Berceau de Cristal&quot; (1976). The earliest performance of &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; was recorded on August 6, 1975, and &quot;Henry Hudson&quot; began appearing in setlists in February 1977.

By March 1978, after &quot;The Sphinx&quot; was also introduced into her set, Nico titled the album &quot;Drama of Exile&quot; and attempted a new style at odds with her previous harmonium-based sound. Nico continued to write and had enough songs ready to record the album in 1981.

== Recording and release ==
In 1981, executive producer Nadette Duget, Philippe Quilichini&#x27;s girlfriend, lived with Nico in London. Duget had heroin connections and supported her own mild drug consumption, as well as Quilichini&#x27;s and Nico&#x27;s more serious addictions.

Aura Records offered to finance one album recorded in London and produced by Philippe Quilichini. Contracts were drawn up, Aura advanced the production costs, and recording began almost immediately in April or May 1981. Recorded at Gooseberry Studios in Tulse Hill, London, with a band composed of Quilichini, French-Iranian guitarist, oriental string instrument expert Muhammad Hadi, drummer Steve Cordonna, Ian Dury&#x27;s saxophone player Davey Payne, percussionist J.J. Johnson of Wayne County&#x27;s Electric Chairs, and Andy Clark who previously played keyboards on David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)&quot; album. Sessions were attended by French journalist Bruno Blum, a friend of J.J. Johnson&#x27;s, who later published the inside story in the French rock magazine &quot;Best&quot;.

The original album was plagued by suspicious circumstances. There are different versions of the story, and the truth remains ambiguous. With the album nearly finished and following a disagreement over money, Aaron Sixx, the head of Aura at the time, allegedly received a tip-off from the studio that Nadette Duget (Nico&#x27;s unofficial manager) had arranged to steal the master tapes from the studio and sell them without reimbursing Aura, but since Sixx had a signed contract with Duget and Quilichini, Sixx was able to take possession of all the multitrack, unmixed tapes. A legal battle ensued which reportedly lasted almost three years.

Duget claimed Nico had not signed the contract which was true, but since Aura had paid out considerable sums in production costs, they owned the recordings.

== Second recording and release ==
Duget, Quilichini, and photographer Antoine Giacomoni moved to a Linden Gardens basement flat in Notting Hill Gate, London. Violin player Thierry Matioszek was added to the lineup. Nico then recorded &quot;Sãeta&quot; and &quot;Vegas,&quot; also produced by Quilichini which was released on the London Flicknife Records label in 1981. Supported by Nico and the musicians, Duget and Quilichini began recording the entire &quot;Drama of Exile&quot; album again.

Meanwhile, a mix of the unfinished first recording of the &quot;Drama of Exile&quot; album was released by Aaron Sixx on the Aura Records label in late 1981, with the date written on the back cover. This was allegedly done without the consent of Nico or the musicians and producers. The album cover was reported to have illegally used an Antoine Giacomoni colour photograph. Furthermore, some of the musicians and mixing engineers were allegedly not credited, but Philippe Quilichini was still credited as producer.

Completed over the summer at Music Works studio in London, the second recording of the album was mixed by producer Quilichini and released a few months later on the Paris indie label Invisible Records. This version of the album features photographs taken by Matioszek and Giacomoni of Nico, her son Ari, and Quilichini on the inner sleeve. The album cover was a large, black &quot;N&quot; with a white background and a nod to Corsican French emperor Napoleon who ended his life in exile. According to Bruno Blum&#x27;s 1982 review, the new version was well mixed and unquestionably superior. It also included two extra tracks, &quot;Sãeta&quot; and &quot;Vegas&quot;.

False stories of the Aura label having released the only official album with Nico&#x27;s consent and of Quilichini having secretly copied the first version of the album tapes to remix later emerged:


The re-recorded album was mixed by the original producer Philippe Quilichini and issued on Invisible Records in the spring of 1982. Deeply hurt by the legal battle and the fate of his work, Philippe Quilichini became involved with heroin and died in 1983. Nadette Duget left London permanently and flew back to Corsica where she died of anorexia a few months later. This left Aaron Sixx to further release the incomplete first version in the Netherlands and Sweden only with Nico&#x27;s permission several months after the debacle with the masters. The original version of the LP was released on CD for the first time in Germany by Line Records in 1988. Shortly after, Nico died.

The album was released in the UK by Great Expectations Records in 1989 and in the US by Cleopatra Records in 1993.

The original recording received mixed reviews from critics. AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave a mostly favorable review, while &quot;Trouser Press&quot; received the album poorly.

== Musical style ==
&quot;Drama of Exile&quot; has been described as &quot;a tentative foray into post-punk&quot;. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, the author writes, &quot;&quot;Drama of Exile&quot; pairs [Nico] with a thin new wave band that wouldn&#x27;t have sounded out-of-place on, say, Rough Trade.&quot; Nico and the album were covered in Dave Thompson&#x27;s book on gothic rock, &quot;The Dark Reign of Gothic Rock&quot;.

<text>The FN F2000 is a 5.56×45mm NATO bullpup rifle, designed by FN Herstal in Belgium. Its compact bullpup design includes a telescopic sight, a non-adjustable fixed notch and front blade secondary sight. The weapon has fully ambidextrous controls, allowed by a unique ejection system, ejecting spent cartridge casings forward and to the right side of the weapon, through a tube running above the barrel. The F2000 made its debut in March 2001 at the IDEX defence exhibition held in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.

==Design details==

The F2000 is a modular weapon system; its principal component is a compact 5.56×45mm NATO-caliber assault rifle in a bullpup configuration. The F2000 is a selective fire weapon operating from a closed bolt.

The rifle consists of two main assemblies: the barreled receiver group and the frame, coupled together by means of an axis pin located above the trigger guard. The barrel group has an integral MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail used to mount optical sights. The frame or lower receiver contains the trigger group, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly, return mechanism and magazine well. A removable handguard is installed in front of the trigger which completes and encloses the trigger guard.

===Features===
The F2000 is a gas-operated, fully automatic and ambidextrous bullpup rifle. Both the safety system and trigger mechanism were adopted from the P90 personal defense weapon; the selector toggle is a rotating disc located below the trigger. The fire selector doubles as the weapon&#x27;s manual safety and secures the firearm against accidental discharge (the selector/safety disc has 3 settings: &quot;S&quot; safe, &quot;1&quot; semi-automatic mode, &quot;A&quot; fully automatic fire). The &quot;safe&quot; setting disables the trigger. The hammers, group pins, and springs are steel while all other components are nylon injection molding. The shell of the rifle is made of composite materials.

The F2000 is fed from standard NATO box magazines (STANAG 4179) with a 30-round cartridge capacity using 5.56×45mm ammunition. The magazine catch/release button is installed symmetrically in the pistol grip, in front of the magazine; the magazine catch is operated by an oversized actuator useful when wearing NBC gloves. The F2000 is not configured from the factory to have a drop-free magazine system due to the friction from the removable dust gaskets. The magazine needs to be pulled out manually.

The rifle does not have a hold-open device; the bolt does not stay back after the last round is fired. The charging handle is placed on the left side of the receiver, just above the hand guard, and can be operated by left-handed shooters. There are no access points for the possible ingress of dirt or debris; the charging handle slot is sealed.

The weapon&#x27;s primary sight is a telescopic sight with a fixed 1.6× magnification (the reticle also enables use in low-light conditions) contained in a plastic housing above the receiver (mounted on the MIL-STD-1913 rail), the secondary sight is a non-adjustable fixed notch and front blade, molded into the optical sight housing cover. The sight cover and sight module can be quickly removed to reveal the Picatinny rail.

The rifle&#x27;s chromed hammer-forged steel barrel is stated to retain accuracy after 20,000 normal (non-sustained) rounds. The barrel also features a flash suppressor with an angled cut at the tip which directs the muzzle blast upward, compensating for muzzle rise. The F2000 has an optional bayonet lug mounted near the muzzle, and an adjustable gas regulator with two settings: &quot;normal&quot; for standard ammunition meeting NATO specifications, and &quot;adverse&quot;, used to send an increased volume of gas into the system to ensure proper functioning when fouled or when using low-pressure ammunition.

===Operating mechanism===
This selective fire weapon is a gas-operated design utilizing a short-stroke piston system driven by propellant gases diverted into the gas cylinder through a port in the barrel; it fires from a closed bolt position. The weapon is locked with a rotating bolt which features 6 radial locking lugs, a spring-powered extractor and ejector. The chamber, bolt, and ejector mechanism can be accessed by flipping up a hinged inspection cover in the receiver, behind the optical sight housing.
The F2000 uses a unique ejection system, ejecting spent cartridge casings forward and to the right side of the weapon, through a tube running above the barrel. This method of ejection provides for fully ambidextrous operation; the rifle can be used without any modification by both right and left-handed shooters. This ejection pattern was achieved by using a swiveling polymer tray, which intercepts the empty casing from the bolt face immediately after disengaging from the extractor. As the empty casing is extracted it is held while the rocker assembly tilts to lift it above and clear of the feed path as the next round is stripped from the magazine by the bolt head. The casing is fed into the tray located in a cavity in the receiver wall, which then pivots the cartridge case and directs it into a chute (above the barrel); the case is discarded from the tilting tray by being impacted by a pin on the moving bolt carrier upon its forward return. Only when the ejection tube contains more than five cases is the first of them ejected forward through a port just behind and to the right of the muzzle. Any cases remaining after firing has ceased, can be cleared by tilting the rifle muzzle down.

This system is patent protected (patent number 5675924 dated 14 October 1997 by René Predazzer and patent 6389725 from February 25, 2000, author Charles Denuit). The ambidexterity provided by forward ejection is its most obvious benefit, and removes many of the tactical and user difficulties (such as lack of ambidexterity, and gas and debris released in close proximity to the shooter&#x27;s face, as in the SA80 or OC-14) that bullpup designs usually create.

===Grenade launcher===

One of the modules developed for the F2000 system is a proprietary lightweight 40 mm underslung GL1 grenade launcher (empty weight 1 kg) that uses standard low-velocity 40×46mm grenades. The launcher is a single-shot breech-loaded reverse pump-action weapon with a barrel that slides forward for loading and unloading (like the M203 grenade launcher), locked by axial rotation of the barrel.

The grenade launcher&#x27;s trigger is installed directly under the F2000&#x27;s trigger so that it can be manipulated without removing the shooting hand from the rifle&#x27;s pistol grip. The double-action trigger lets the operator &quot;try again&quot; if the grenade&#x27;s percussion type primer doesn&#x27;t ignite. The breech release button is found on the left side of the launcher body, like on the M203. The grenade launcher comes with a basic flip-up ladder sight, but it was intended to be used with a specially designed optoelectronic fire control system designated FCS, developed in cooperation with the Finnish company Noptel.

The aiming module is installed in place of the standard optical sight and becomes the weapon&#x27;s primary sight when mounted, but its main purpose is to accurately determine and indicate the range of a grenade target. The module is powered by a 9 V battery pack, installed in the stock, behind the magazine well. The power pack is also intended to power any other tactical accessories or systems that could be introduced. The FCS integrates a low-power laser rangefinder (precise to within ± 1 m), a day-time aiming channel with an electronically projected reticle, a measured range display reading and a diode elevation adjustment indicator.

The fire control system calculates a firing solution manifested by the barrel&#x27;s angle of elevation using target range information from the laser rangefinder (the rangefinder is activated by pushing a button on the pistol grip, below the trigger), corrected manually by the shooter through a push-button interface (add/subtract buttons) on the FCS top cover to take account for head or tail winds that could affect the desired range. The F2000 FCS also contains software with the ballistic properties of up to six types of 40 mm grenades and can be reprogrammed to take advantage of future munition improvements. Batteries for the FCS are located in the bottom of the buttstock.

After obtaining a range measurement, the distance to the target is displayed on a liquid crystal screen and the elevation diode flashes red. Once a correct elevation has been achieved by tilting the rifle, the diode changes color to green indicating the weapon is ready to fire

==Variants==
===F2000 Tactical===
The F2000 Tactical railed variant is similar to the standard model, but it lacks the optical sight, and comes instead with an extended top receiver MIL-STD-1913 rail with flip-up iron sights allowing for picatinny rail accessories to be fitted.

===F2000 Tactical TR===
The F2000 Tactical TR variant is similar to the F2000 Tactical model, but includes a triple rail handguard for add-on accessories.

===FS2000===
Intended for civilian ownership, the FS2000 is a semi-automatic version of the F2000 that first became available in June 2006. The FS2000 Tactical model is equipped with an extended barrel with a permanently attached muzzle brake and a 1:7 in right hand twist rifling rate; the bayonet lug was not included on the FS2000 rifles. The lower hand guard can be removed in the same manner as the F2000 to accept the same variety of accessories. It comes with a Picatinny rail optic rail along with backup iron sights. The rear flip-up National Match-sized aperture is adjustable for windage, while the removable front sight is adjustable for elevation. A small number of the early models featured a stepped barrel contour as well as a demilled bayonet lug. Measurements on the stepped barrel&#x27;s rifling were as long as the non-stepped barrel, revealing that the stepped barrel is not simply a shorter F2000 military barrel with an extended muzzle brake which is similar to the PS90.

A variant of the FS2000, called the FS2000 Standard, is equipped with the factory F2000 1.6× magnification optic and sight cover.

===F2000 S===
A version of the F2000 modified for the Slovenian Army. It incorporates an elevated upper Picatinny rail that also doubles as a carrying handle.

==Conflicts==

The FN F2000 has been used in the following conflicts:

* War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)
* Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
* Operation Astute
* Mexican Drug War
* Libyan Civil War
* Yemeni Civil War (2014-present)
* Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen
* Houthi–Saudi Arabian conflict
* Russian invasion of Ukraine

==Users==
* : Used by the Special Forces Group of the Belgian Armed Forces Land Component.
* : In use with VIP protection units and National Police of East Timor.
* : Used by the Special Protection Group and National Security Guard.
* : Purchased 367 F2000 rifles along with other assorted lethal and non-lethal weapon systems from FN Herstal in 2008, and deliveries commenced in 2009. In the 2011 Libyan Civil War, Libyan rebel forces captured a number of these weapons from forces loyal to the Gaddafi government.

<text>A tea cosy or tea warmer is a cover for a teapot, traditionally made of cloth. It insulates a teapot, keeping the contents warm. Their use predates the invention of vacuum flasks as a means of keeping hot liquids hot. 

Sometimes, if the tea is served in a restaurant or in a hotel, the teapot is covered with a tea cosy that has a metal exterior to protect the inner fabric of the cosy from wear and tear and also to further improve the insulation of the teapot. A typical cosy is easy to put over or pop off the teapot in order to pour the tea, but some are wrapped around the teapot and have holes for the spout and the handle (so called &quot;bachelor&quot; teapots). The &quot;crinoline lady&quot; cosies include a porcelain doll on the top, with her flowing skirts providing the thermal insulation.

Tea cosies may have padded inserts that can be removed and washed. Some tea cosies are hand-knitted, resembling woollen hats, some even feature a &quot;bobble&quot; (pom-pom) on top, which may also serve as a handle to remove or lift the tea cosy. A special tea cosy is the so-called tea lugger, which enables the hot teapot to be carried around easily.

Tea cosies may sometimes be made in matching sets with items such as tablecloths, place mats, egg cosies, oven gloves, or aprons. Cloth tea-cosies may be embroidered, perhaps to complement a fine set of china. Some have been made with hidden pockets to be filled with fragrant herbs or flowers, similar to a potpourri.

==History==
Although the history of the tea cosy may have begun when tea was introduced from China to Britain in the 1660s (Pettigrew suggests the origins in the 18th century), the first documented use of a tea cosy in Britain was in 1867. It is probably the Duchess of Bedford who, by establishing the activity of afternoon tea in 1840, would have brought the popularity of the tea cosy. During the Victorian era tea time was important for social interaction, and the absence of central heating made drinks cool fast, so the use of an insulation jacket for the teapot made sense. 

Tea cosies started to be used in North America in the same period. Newspapers of the time reveal that tea cosies enjoyed &quot;a sudden and unexpected rise in public favor&quot; among women who hosted tea parties. Newspapers of the time included advice columns on how to make one: &quot;Some very handsome ones are made of remnants of heavy brocade, but linen is generally used, embroidered or not, according to taste, as these covers are washable. Make the covering large enough for your teapot and provide a ring at the top to lift it off with.&quot;

Tea cosies then flourished during the late 19th century, where they appeared in many households across Britain, motivated by the obsession of decorating and covering objects characteristic of the Victorian era. The popularity continued into the 20th century, when cosy become an object of handicraft for both homemakers and craftsmen. The use of cosies dwindled by the end of the 20th century due to the reduced use of teapots (these are not required if the tea bags are used).

==Art and literature==
Tea cosy needlework art is captured by a collection of the Norfolk Museums and Archeology Service on contemporary British artists and artisans.

Tea cosies in fiction include the eponymous item in Edward Gorey&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Tea-Cosy: A Dispirited and Distasteful Diversion for Christmas&quot;.

A well known quote from Scottish comedian Billy Connolly is &quot;Never trust a man who, when left alone in a room with a tea cosy, does not try it on.&quot;

Australian author Loani Prior&#x27;s &quot;Wild Tea Cosies and Really Wild Tea Cosies&quot; made the Top Ten of the Australian National Bestseller List in 2008 and 2010 respectively. Loani&#x27;s tea cosies have been exhibited at the Powerhouse Museum.

<doc id="1134682" wikidata="Q14217100" url="?curid=1134682" title="Griffith, New South Wales">
<text>Griffith is a major regional city in the north-western Riverina region of New South Wales, known commonly as the food bowl of Australia. It is also the seat of the City of Griffith local government area. Like the Australian capital, Canberra, and extensions to the nearby town of Leeton, Griffith was designed by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin. Griffith was named after Arthur Hill Griffith, the then New South Wales Secretary for Public Works. Griffith was proclaimed a city in 1987, and at the had a population of 20,569.

It can be accessed by road from Sydney and Canberra via the Hume Highway and the Burley Griffin Way and from Melbourne, via the Newell Highway and either by using the Kidman Way or the Irrigation Way. Griffith can be accessed from other places like Adelaide, Orange, and Bathurst through the Mid-Western Highway and the Rankins Springs road from Rankins Springs and the Kidman Way from Goolgowi.

==History==
Griffith and other towns were created as part of the New South Wales State Government&#x27;s Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) project, a plan to supply irrigation from the Murrumbidgee river to open up western New South Wales for farming.

The town plan for Griffith, and nearby Leeton, was designed by Walter Burley Griffin in 1914, an unusual geometric pattern centred on a set of circular streets, with broad avenues radiating out in an octagonal arrangement. The streets were surveyed mostly according to that plan, and Griffith was declared a town in August 1916. 

The main dam of the scheme was the large Burrinjuck Dam on the Murrumbidgee between Gundagai and Canberra, but was not completed until 1928. The Berembed Weir, near Narrandera, was built in 1912, diverting water from the Murrumbidgee River into the Bundidgerry Creek then into the Main Canal of the MIA at Narrandera. The Canal, almost a river in its own right, flows through the MIA, supplying water to the entire area, then flows through Griffith as part of the geometric plan, and peters out to the northwest of the town in rice farms.

The water supply was further enhanced with the construction of the Snowy River scheme by the Australian Federal Government in the 1950s and 1960s. The Blowering Dam, a large dam near Tumut, stores a significant amount of water to be released down the Murrumbidgee for irrigation around Leeton, Griffith and the newer Coleambally area south of the river and Griffith.

From the start of the MIA, citrus and other fruit and vegetables were grown in abundance around Griffith. In the 1950s the irrigation area expanded to include large rice farms. Vineyards were established early, and wineries followed, beginning with McWilliam&#x27;s Wines at Hanwood and Yenda, two villages just outside the city.

From its earliest days, the MIA was populated by Italian workers, some of whom were initially employed by Australian farmers to run steamboats on the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Approximately 60% of today&#x27;s Griffith population claim Italian background. These include the initial settlement of Italians from the boat crews and other Italians who came out to Australia in the Depression, or from a second wave of immigrant Italians who came to Griffith in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In the 1970s, Griffith was often associated with drug distribution (particularly marijuana) and organised crime, as depicted in 2009 by . However, Griffith is now associated with good wine and food, primarily as a result of its diverse population, with notable contributions by Italian-Australians. Griffith&#x27;s multi-ethnic population is now absorbing new national groups, including a significant Sikh Indian community. The city is sister city with the Italian city of Treviso in the Veneto Region. Many Italians in Griffith are from the Veneto Region or the Calabria Region of Italy.The Italian influence expanded the range of fruit and vegetables, and also significantly increased the number of wineries and the range of wines produced by the existing wineries in the region, such as McWilliam&#x27;s. De Bortoli, Rosetto, Calabria and other wineries were established by Italian immigrants, and today they are well known around Australia. In recent times they have been joined by one of the country&#x27;s best known wine labels, Yellow Tail, produced by Casella Family Brands. Casella, DeBortoli, McWilliam&#x27;s, Warburn and Berton Vineyards are now among the top 20 wine producers in Australia.

Griffith is the cathedral city of the Anglican Diocese of Riverina. The foundation stone of the Parish Church of St Alban the Martyr was dedicated in 1954. It was proclaimed as a cathedral in 1984.

<text>Kaye Mary Darveniza (born 15 February 1955) is an Australian politician. She was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1999 to 2014, first representing Melbourne West Province. In the 2006 Victoria State election, she transferred to the Northern Victoria Region and was re-elected.

Darveniza was born in the town of Mooroopna and educated in Shepparton. She studied nursing, becoming a registered psychiatric nurse in 1975. She then left the workforce for six years, before returning in 1981. In 1986, Darveniza became involved with the trade union movement, becoming an organiser with the Health and Community Services Union. Three years later, she rose to become the union&#x27;s state secretary—a position she held for ten years, until her election to parliament. She also acted as the national president of the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia from 1990 to 1991, and as the national vice president of the Health Services Union of Australia from 1991 to 1999.

At the 1999 state election, Darveniza shifted from the union movement into politics, winning Labor preselection for the seat of Melbourne West Province. After Labor won a surprise victory, the newly elected Darveniza was given a parliamentary secretary position. In her first term in office, she also served on both the Economic Development Committee and the Legislative Council Printing Committee from 1999 to 2002.

Darveniza is the sister of South Australian Labor MP Gail Gago.

Darveniza is a member of the Labor Unity faction.

<text>The Royal Institute of Chemistry was a British scientific organisation. Founded in 1877 as the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland (ICGBI), its role was to focus on qualifications and the professional status of chemists, and its aim was to ensure that consulting and analytical chemists were properly trained and qualified. 

The society received its first Royal Charter on 13 June 1885, and King George VI awarded the society royal patronage with effect from 14 May 1943, from which date it became the Royal Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland (RICGBI). This re-designation was formally confirmed by the grant of a Supplemental Charter on 29 March 1944.

As well as insisting on thorough professional qualifications, it also laid down strict ethical standards. Its main qualifications were Licentiate (LRIC) (professional training following a course of practical study to a standard lower than an honours degree), Graduate (GRIC) (completion of study equivalent to at least second class honours degree), Associate (ARIC) (LRIC plus professional experience), Member (MRIC) (GRIC plus professional experience) and Fellow (FRIC) (more experience and standing than MRIC) of the Royal Institute of Chemistry. Following a supplemental Charter in 1975, Members and Fellows were permitted to use the letters &quot;CChem&quot; (Chartered Chemist). It published &quot;Royal Institute of Chemistry Reviews&quot; from 1968 to 1971, when it combined to form &quot;Chemical Society Reviews&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry&quot;.

At the same time, the Chemical Society had concentrated on the science of chemistry, and publishing learned journals. In 1972 these two organisations, together with the Faraday Society and the Society for Analytical Chemistry, started the process of merging, becoming the Royal Society of Chemistry on 15 May 1980.

<doc id="1134708" wikidata="Q473363" url="?curid=1134708" title="Ammonia Avenue">
<text>Ammonia Avenue is the seventh studio album by the British progressive rock band the Alan Parsons Project, released in February 1984 by Arista Records. The Phil Spector-influenced &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer Me&quot; was the album&#x27;s lead single, and reached the Top 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, as well as the fourth position on the Adult Contemporary chart. The single also reached the Top 20 in several countries and represents the last big hit for the Alan Parsons Project. &quot;Prime Time&quot; was a follow-up release that fared well in the Top 40, reaching No. 34. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Believe&quot; was the first single in November 1983, reaching #54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and &quot;Since the Last Goodbye&quot; was a minor hit.

&quot;Ammonia Avenue&quot; is one of the band&#x27;s biggest-selling albums, carrying an RIAA certification of gold and reaching the Top 10 in a number of countries.

==Background and release==
The title of the album was inspired by Eric Woolfson&#x27;s visit to Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Billingham, England, where the first thing he saw was a street with miles of pipes, no people, no trees and a sign that read &#x27;Ammonia Avenue&#x27;, whose portrait was used for the front cover. The album focuses on the possible misunderstanding of industrial scientific developments from a public perspective and a lack of understanding of the public from a scientific perspective. This album was the second of three recorded on analogue equipment and mixed directly to the digital master tape.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Believe&quot; had already been released as both a single and a new song on 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Best of the Alan Parsons Project&quot; compilation.

===Promotion===
Music videos for &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer Me&quot; and &quot;Prime Time&quot; were produced in 1984, the former with art and animation by MW Kaluta. The latter video is inspired by John Collier&#x27;s story &quot;Evening Primrose&quot; and features two mannequins, a female and a male one, coming to life and falling in love with each other. About halfway through the video, a street sign for &quot;Ammonia Ave.&quot; appears.

==Reissue==
&quot;Ammonia Avenue&quot; was remastered and reissued in 2008 with bonus tracks, and in 2020 as well, on Blu-Ray audio format, including a high-definition remaster in stereo and multichannel sound, and the two promotional videos of the album as a bonus. In 2024, the album was again completely remastered.

<doc id="1134713" wikidata="Q175123" url="?curid=1134713" title="Kroppkaka">
<text>Kroppkaka (plural &quot;kroppkakor&quot;) is a traditional Swedish boiled potato dumpling, most commonly filled with onions and meat. Potatoes, wheat flour, onion, salt and minced meat/pork are common ingredients in kroppkaka. They are very similar to the Norwegian raspeball, Lithuanian cepelinai and German klöße. And quite similar to the Swedish palt and Polish Pyzy.

Kroppkakor are served with butter (melted), lingonberry jam or heavy cream. There are some regional variations of the recipe with different proportions of boiled and raw potatoes. Spices are heavily featured in some variations. Kroppkakor are mainly eaten in the southern Swedish landskap (provinces) of Öland, Småland, Gotland and Blekinge.

The dish is very different between regions. In Blekinge, the kroppkakor are called &quot;grey kroppkakor&quot; and are made from almost only raw potatoes and only a tiny bit boiled potatoes are used. In Öland, kroppkakor are made from mostly raw potatoes and a small amount of boiled potato. In Småland, kroppkakor are made of mostly boiled potatoes and a small amount of raw potato, and in Gotland, kroppkakor are made of only boiled potatoes.

In Blekinge and Öland, there are kroppkakor with different fillings such as eel and seabirds which were historically eaten mostly by the poor. However, the most common filling is pork.

Kroppkakor comes from the southeastern area of Sweden, but in northern Sweden, there is a similar dish called palt. Palt is made in a similar way, but the ingredients differ a little and it is made from uncooked potatoes only, such as what kind of flour and what kind of potatoes are used, which makes a difference in taste from kroppkakor.

<doc id="1134714" wikidata="Q1891138" url="?curid=1134714" title="The Go-Betweens">
<text>The Go-Betweens were an Australian indie rock band formed in Brisbane, Queensland, in 1977. The band was co-founded and led by singer-songwriters and guitarists Robert Forster and Grant McLennan, who were its only constant members throughout its existence. Drummer Lindy Morrison joined the band in 1980, and its lineup would later expand to include bass guitarist Robert Vickers and multi-instrumentalist Amanda Brown. Vickers was replaced by John Willsteed in 1987, and the quintet lineup remained in place until the band split two years later. Forster and McLennan reformed the band in 2000 with a new lineup that did not include any previous personnel aside from them. McLennan died on 6 May 2006 of a heart attack and the Go-Betweens disbanded again. In 2010, a toll bridge in their native Brisbane was renamed the Go Between Bridge after them.

In 1988, &quot;Streets of Your Town&quot;, the first single from &quot;16 Lovers Lane&quot;, entered the Top 100 on both the Kent Music Report chart in Australia and the UK Singles Chart in the United Kingdom. The follow-up single &quot;Was There Anything I Could Do?&quot; was a No. 16 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. In May 2001, &quot;Cattle and Cane&quot;, from 1983&#x27;s &quot;Before Hollywood&quot;, was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2008, &quot;16 Lovers Lane&quot; was highlighted on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) TV&#x27;s &quot;The Great Australian Albums&quot; series.

==Career==
===1977–1982: early years===
Robert Forster and Grant McLennan met at the University of Queensland, where both were taking a theatre arts course. Forster provided vocals and guitar, while McLennan provided vocals, bass, and guitar; the pair shared songwriting duties. Together, they formed The Go-Betweens in December 1977 in Brisbane, Queensland. The name of the band reflects L. P. Hartley&#x27;s classic novel &quot;The Go-Between&quot;. The band made its first public appearance as the support act for The Numbers at Baroona Hall in Brisbane in early April 1978. The band, however, were still without a drummer, having borrowed Gerard Lee for their first show. They had a succession of drummers, starting with Bruce Anthon (ex–The Survivors). With a guest drummer, Dennis Cantwell (The Riptides), they recorded their debut single, &quot;Lee Remick&quot;, in May 1978. The song, an ode to the US actress Lee Remick, was released on the independent Able label in September 1978. The B-side to the single, &quot;Karen&quot;, was a love song to a librarian. The sleeve depicts Forster and McLennan alongside portraits of Bob Dylan, Che Guevara and Lee Remick. The band sent copies to record labels around the world, with interest shown by the UK arm of America&#x27;s Beserkley Records. The group&#x27;s first real drummer was Temucin &quot;Tim&quot; Mustafa, recruited after the recording of &quot;Lee Remick&quot;, although he appears on the picture sleeve of the single. The band further expanded with the addition of guitarist Peter Milton Walsh. Beserkley offered the band a contract that proposed the re-issue of &quot;Lee Remick&quot; and &quot;Karen&quot; as two singles, followed by an eight-album deal. The band recorded two more songs for Beserkley in November 1978 (including &quot;The Sound of Rain&quot;); however, when Beserkley went bust weeks later, Walsh left to form The Apartments.

The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;People Say&quot;, which was recorded in May 1979, was produced by The Go-Betweens with Mustapha on drums and Malcolm Kelly on piano and organ. The B-side, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Come Back&quot;, is a farewell to Walsh, who remained friends with Forster and McLennan. From May 1978 to May 1979, the group recorded some tracks live in Forster&#x27;s bedroom using McLennan&#x27;s two-track tape deck—they were not released until 1999 as &quot;78 &#x27;Til 79 – The Lost Album&quot;, which also includes both sides of the first two singles. These songs were simple pop tunes with a rough new wave edge, an obvious blend of pure pop influences such as The Monkees with the gritty simplicity of The Velvet Underground.

In November 1979, the duo left Australia with a plan to shop their songs from record company to record company simply by visiting their offices and playing them. In Glasgow, Scotland, on 28 April 1980, for independent label Postcard, they recorded their next single, &quot;I Need Two Heads&quot;, with Steven Daly of Scottish band Orange Juice guesting on drums and Alex Fergusson producing. Forster returned to Australia in June 1980, whilst McLennan continued to New York. They followed Australian contemporaries The Birthday Party to the busier music scene in London. &quot;I Need Two Heads&quot; peaked at No. 6 on the UK independent charts. Upon return to Brisbane they were joined by Belinda &quot;Lindy&quot; Morrison (ex-Xero) on drums in 1980. In November 1980 the band played their first Sydney show at the Paris Theatre, supporting The Birthday Party and the Laughing Clowns. The band impressed Missing Link Records label boss, Keith Glass, which had re-issued &quot;I Need Two Heads&quot; for the Australian market, and offered to release the band&#x27;s next single. Their fourth single, the first with Morrison, &quot;Your Turn My Turn&quot;, was recorded in Sydney with Tony Cohen (The Birthday Party) in April 1981. The single was released in September. They recorded ten tracks as demos in Brisbane during 1981, which were released as &quot;Very Quick on the Eye&quot; by Man Made Records in 1982, the tracks showed that Morrison&#x27;s &quot;drum abilities, always a deeply underrated part of the band&#x27;s appeal, fit hand in glove with the arrangements&quot;. By this time, Forster and Morrison were lovers and Morrison was living in Spring Hill.

The band&#x27;s first official album, &quot;Send Me a Lullaby&quot;, produced by The Go-Betweens and Tony Cohen, on Missing Link in Australia, was released as an eight-track mini-album in November 1981. Missing Link&#x27;s UK distributors, Rough Trade, released the album in the UK, three months later, with four tracks added. Morrison provided the album title, in preference to &quot;Two Wimps and a Witch&quot;, from a Zelda Fitzgerald novel &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot;. The group had developed a subtler sound consisting of dry semi-spoken vocals, complex lyrics and melodic but fractious guitar pop influenced by contemporary bands such as Television, Wire and Talking Heads. Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, described the album as &quot;tentative and clumsy [with] its brittle, rough-hewn sound&quot;. Forster and McLennan wrote all the tracks, they alternated lead vocal duties, except &quot;People Know&quot; which had Morrison on vocals and James Freud (Models) guesting on saxophone. Enticed by Rough Trade, the band relocated to London. The band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Hammer the Hammer&quot;, was released by Rough Trade, in July 1982. In 2002, UK label Circus released a 2× CD version of &quot;Send Me a Lullaby&quot; which included &quot;After the Fireworks&quot; recorded as a collaboration with The Birthday Party&#x27;s Nick Cave on vocals, Mick Harvey on piano and Rowland S. Howard on guitar. It had been released as a single under the band name, Tuff Monks in 1982 on Au Go Go Records.

===1983–1989===
The Go-Betweens returned to the UK and recorded their second album, &quot;Before Hollywood&quot; (May 1983), with John Brand producing, at the International Christian Communications studio in Eastbourne. It established them as cult favourites while &quot;Cattle and Cane&quot; was released as a single and was &quot;[a]rguably the band&#x27;s absolute highlight of its earliest years&quot;. In Australia, the song had exposure on the national broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)&#x27;s iconic pop music TV series &quot;Countdown&quot;. Their tracks were played on ABC&#x27;s alternative rock radio station Triple J—although mainly heard only in the Sydney region at that time. Despite the consistent critical acclaim their recordings garnered both in Australia and overseas, The Go-Betweens were mostly ignored by Australian commercial pop radio and never gained a broad national audience. &quot;Before Hollywood&quot; was described as &quot;more world-weary [...] full of deceptively simple yet accomplished songs&quot;.

Robert Vickers joined on bass guitar in late 1983—freeing McLennan for lead guitar work. Their next album, &quot;Spring Hill Fair&quot; (September 1984), was produced by Brand with Robert Andrews and Colin Fairley for Sire Records. The album was acclaimed as &quot;the sound was bolder and more confident&quot;, while &quot;Man O&#x27; Sand to Girl O&#x27; Sea&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Kisses&quot; and &quot;Part Company&quot; were issued as singles. In 1985, the band signed with True Tone Records distributed by PolyGram.

&quot;Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express&quot;, released in March 1986 on Beggars Banquet Records, received favourable reviews, and it showed the band gradually moving towards a smoother and more contemporary sound while retaining elements of their idiosyncratic early style. McFarlane claims &quot;[it] remains the band&#x27;s most cohesive and finely crafted statement&quot;. &quot;Spring Rain&quot; (February) and &quot;Head Full of Steam&quot; (June) were released as singles, with &quot;Spring Rain&quot; reaching the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart Top 100.

Amanda Brown on violin, oboe, guitar, keyboards and backing vocals joined later in the year. Within a few months, Brown and McLennan were lovers—many of McLennan&#x27;s new lyrics were about this relationship. &quot;Tallulah&quot; (June 1987), produced by The Go-Betweens for True Tone and Beggars Banquet contained their &quot;most winsome and hummable songs, &quot;Right Here&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Pride&quot;&quot;; while Brown&#x27;s contributions &quot;added extra lustre&quot;. LO-MAX Records released a 2× CD version of &quot;Tallulah&quot; in 2004, one of the additional tracks, &quot;Doo Wop in &#x27;A&#x27; (Bam Boom)&quot; was co-written by Morrison, Brown, McLennan and Forster. In November 1987, The Go-Betweens returned to Australia and John Willsteed (ex-Xero with Morrison) replaced Vickers on bass.

&quot;16 Lovers Lane&quot; (1988), was the group&#x27;s most commercial offering, providing the alternative radio hit &quot;Streets of Your Town&quot; (1988), which entered the chart singles both the UK and Australia peaking in the Top 100 but not higher than the number 80. The follow-up single &quot;Was There Anything I Could Do?&quot; was a No. 16 hit on US alternative Modern Rock radio stations, and Beggars Banquet, trying to encourage the band&#x27;s commercial momentum re-released &quot;Streets of Your Town&quot; in the UK in early 1989, where it charted low once again. These minimal successes were hardly the hoped-for commercial breakthrough for the band.

After recording six albums, Forster and McLennan decided in December 1989 to disband The Go-Betweens. There were tentative plans to form an acoustic duo together. When McLennan told Brown, she ended their relationship. Forster and McLennan pursued solo careers. Brown and Morrison formed Cleopatra Wong in 1991.

All official albums released in the 1980s have titles with a double L word, except &quot;16 Lovers Lane&quot;, which has two words beginning with an L. For their first few albums, this was simply a coincidence; by the end of the decade, for their own amusement the band deliberately kept to a self-imposed &#x27;tradition&#x27; of album titles that featured a double L.

===2000–2006: reformation===
Forster and McLennan pursued solo careers throughout the 1990s, and McLennan also collaborated with Steve Kilbey of The Church in the studio project band Jack Frost.

Forster and McLennan were inspired to work together again after they were invited by fans at French music magazine &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; to perform at the magazine&#x27;s 10th anniversary on 23 May 1996 in Paris. For this performance the band comprised Forster, McLennan, Adele Pickvance on bass guitar and Glenn Thompson on drums.

In 2000, Forster, McLennan and Pickvance went to Jackpot! studio in Portland, Oregon, with members of Sleater-Kinney, and recorded the album &quot;The Friends of Rachel Worth&quot; (the first album to ignore their &quot;double L&quot; titling tradition).

The 2001 Thompson rejoined the band for the Australian Big Day Out Festival. This line up of Forster, McLennan, Pickvance and Thompson went on to record &quot;Bright Yellow Bright Orange&quot; and in October 2005, The Go-Betweens finally achieved mainstream recognition, with the album &quot;Oceans Apart&quot; (produced by Mark Wallis and Dave Ruffy) winning the ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album. Grant McLennan died on 6 May 2006 of a heart attack, and Robert Forster subsequently announced that The Go-Betweens were no more. Forster has continued to perform and records as a solo artist and has also written well-received music criticism.

In August 2006, several of their album re-entered the ARIA top 500.

==Legacy==

The focal point of The Go-Betweens was the song writing skills of Forster and McLennan, described by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau as &quot;the greatest songwriting partnership working today.&quot; Each developed a distinctive but complementary style: Forster&#x27;s songs were angular and angst-ridden, making much use of irony and unusual lyrical imagery, while McLennan&#x27;s were generally softer and more sensitive, his lyrics often based on character study and reported speech. Without ever securing an Australian or UK Top 50 chart single—a fact which mystified their supporters in the press, to the point where this &quot;scandalous&quot; lack of popular success became a cliché when writing about the band. However, there were a few very minor chart successes for the band, starting with &quot;Spring Rain&quot;, which snuck into the lower rungs of the Australian charts in 1986 and became the band&#x27;s first ever Top 100 chart hit. The following year, &quot;Right Here&quot; similarly rode low on the UK Top 100 Charts. Then in 1988, &quot;Streets of Your Town&quot;, the first single from 1988&#x27;s &quot;16 Lovers Lane&quot;, reached the Top 100 in both Australia and UK.

In May 2001 &quot;Cattle and Cane&quot;, written by McLennan and Forster, was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. McLennan described writing the lyrics:

Their song, &quot;Streets of Your Town&quot;, was used by Prime Television and GWN in their station identification from 2001 to 2003. Elements from the same song were sampled in the 2003 single &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; by the Italian dance group Milky.

In the 4th Season of American TV Series &quot;24&quot; a company is named McLennan-Forster—the producer of the series and author, Evan Katz, wanted to express his veneration of the Go-Betweens by this company name.

On the eve of the first anniversary of McLennan&#x27;s death, Triple J &amp; JTV broadcast a tribute concert to The Go-Betweens, recorded in 2006 at Brisbane venue, the Tivoli Theatre. Inspired by this tribute concert, and featuring many of the same artists, a tribute album to The Go-Betweens, &quot;Write Your Adventures Down&quot;, was released in June 2007 in Australia by The Red Label.

In 2008, &quot;16 Lovers Lane&quot; was highlighted on SBS TV&#x27;s &quot;The Great Australian Albums&quot; series as a classic example of 1980s rock music.
The documentary was later released on DVD.

On 29 September 2009, Brisbane City Council announced that a four-lane traffic bridge, previously known as Hale Street Link, would be renamed as Go Between Bridge in the band&#x27;s honour, following a popularity poll.

The Go-Betweens are referenced in the Teenage Fanclub song &quot;When I Still Have Thee&quot; (2010), the Belle and Sebastian song &quot;Shoot the Sexual Athlete&quot; (2001), the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Be Grant McLennan&quot; (1991) by fellow Australians Smudge, and the song &quot;Kathy&quot; (1993) by Clouds.

Nada Surf covered their song &quot;Love Goes On!&quot; on their covers album &quot;If I Had a Hi-Fi&quot; (2010).

Robert Forster continues to perform and also contribute articles to &quot;The Monthly&quot; magazine. On the 3rd February 2023 he released his eighth studio album, &quot;The Candle and the Flame&quot; featuring Adele Pickvance on bass.

Many Australian bands and artists associated with the dolewave genre cite the Go-Betweens as a major influence, including Dick Diver and singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett.

<text>The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) is a department of the government of Kansas under the Governor of Kansas. It is responsible for providing services and expertise that promote agriculture and protect Kansas&#x27; food supply and natural resources while stimulating economic growth.

The current Secretary of Agriculture is Mike Beam, who was appointed by Governor Laura Kelly in 2019.

== History ==
The Kansas Department of Agriculture&#x27;s history traces back to the 1850s when a group of farmers in Kansas Territory created agriculture &quot;societies&quot;. Records of the earliest society, established in 1857, are sparse because they were burned when a confederate named William Quantrill raided and burned Lawrence, Kansas. The Kansas State Agricultural Society held its first public meeting in 1857, while Kansas was a territory. The Kansas Legislature officially adopted the Kansas State Agricultural Society as a state entity in 1862.

The Kansas Board of Agriculture was created in 1872, building upon the work of the Kansas State Agricultural Society, which had served as a model for departments of agriculture nationwide. The agency became the Kansas Department of Agriculture in 1995. Kansas Farmer, an agricultural publication in Kansas, was established in 1863 in Topeka by the Kansas State Board of Agriculture. Kansas State University has a collection of its magazines.

On March 5, 1862, the Kansas Legislature created the Kansas State Agricultural Society, with Floyd Perry Baker temporarily presiding, by statute to organize agricultural work statewide. In 1872, the Kansas Legislature created the State Board of Agriculture from the structure of the Agriculture Society. It became the grandfather of agricultural departments in all fifty states.

The board&#x27;s early years were spent organizing a state fair and acting as an immigration agency to attract needed settlers to homestead in Kansas. Gradually, the state lost its image as a part of the &quot;Great American Desert&quot;. Farms and towns sprang up on the fertile plains of the future wheat state. The Board of Agriculture through an annual report and various publications about Kansas served as a source of information and new techniques in farming.

Through the grasshopper invasion, droughts, blizzards, and through the invention of barbed wire, the development of combines and advances undreamed in 1872, the Kansas Board of Agriculture has served the producers and consumers of Kansas agricultural products. In 1994, a court found the selection process for choosing a Secretary of Agriculture was unconstitutional and placed the governor of Kansas in charge. Following this the Board was renamed the Kansas Department of Agriculture.

==Activities==
The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) has many divisions and programs including the Agricultural Laboratory, Agricultural Marketing, Advocacy, and Outreach Team, Dairy and Feed Safety, Division of Animal Health, Division of Conservation, Division of Water Resources, Emergency Management, Food Safety and Lodging, Grain Warehouse, Meat and Poultry Inspection, Pesticide and Fertilizer, Plant Protection and Weed Control, and Weights and Measures. The Department also provides a large variety of services including licensing guides, grants and cost-share programs, Kansas commodity commissions, export inspections (foreign or domestic), soil fumigation notifications, weed free forage inspections, export certificate applications, live plant inspection applications, and much more.

On June 16, 2014, the majority of the department&#x27;s employees were moved from Topeka to offices in Manhattan, Kansas.
===Former Secretaries===
==Leadership==
The Department is administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Under Governor Laura Kelly, Mike Beam was appointed as Secretary in January 2019.

===State Board of Agriculture===
The Kansas State Board of Agriculture serves as an advisory board to the Governor of Kansas and the Secretary of Agriculture. The Board is composed of nine members, appointed by the Governor to serve four year terms. One member is appointed from each of Kansas&#x27; four congressional districts, with the remaining five being appointed at-large. No two members can reside in the same county and no more than five members may be from the same political party. The Board is responsible for electing its own Chair and Vice Chair.

The Board assists the Governor and Secretary in the development of legislative priorities and Departmental rules and regulations, except those which relate solely to personnel matters of the Department. The Board, however, has no powers, duties or functions concerning the day-to-day operations of the Department.

The Board includes the following: Tracy Brunner (District 1), Janis Lee (District 1), Jerry C. McReynolds (District 1), William Pracht (District 2), Thad G. Geiger (District 2), Scott Thellman (District 2), Scott Strickland (District 3), Donna Pearson McClish (District 3), and Michael L. Springer (District 4).

Prior to the current system for selecting members of the board, farm interest groups would send delegates to a convention held for this purpose. The board members then selected the Secretary of Agriculture who would be confirmed by the Kansas Senate. This system was ruled unconstitutional by the courts in 1994, making way for the current system

<doc id="1134720" wikidata="Q1538832" url="?curid=1134720" title="Gothiscandza">
<text>According to a tale related by Jordanes in his &quot;Getica&quot;, Gothiscandza was the first settlement area of the Goths after their migration from Scandza during the first half of the 1st century CE. He claimed that the name was still in use in his own day (c. 551).

==Jordanes&#x27; account==
Jordanes relates that the East Germanic tribe of Goths were led from Scandza by their king Berig. As soon as they had set foot in the land, they named the area &quot;Gothiscandza&quot;. The slowest of the three ships carried the Gepids, who settled in the &quot;province of Spesis on an island surrounded by the shallow waters of the Vistula. This island they called, in the speech of their fathers, Gepedoios&quot;.

They soon moved to the settlements of the Rugians (&quot;Ulmerugi&quot;, a Germanic tribe which had arrived in the area already before the Goths), who lived on the coast, and they chased them away. Then they defeated their new neighbours, the Vandals.

After some time, when at least four generations of kings had passed after Berig, and Filimer was the king of the Goths, their numbers had multiplied. Filimer decided that everyone was to leave Gothiscandza and move to a new region named Oium (Scythia).

The reliability of Jordanes for early Gothic history has been called into question.

==Etymology==
One interpretation of Gothiscandza is that is a Latinised form of the Gothic &quot;gutisk-an[d]ja&quot;, &quot;Gothic end (or frontier)&quot;, since the Goths&#x27; territory extended to here. Another interpretation is that &quot;an[d]ja&quot; means &quot;cape&quot; so that the whole word means &quot;gothic peninsula&quot;. It is also possible that the word is a product of conflation of the words &quot;gothic&quot; and &quot;Scandinavia&quot;. Herwig Wolfram mentions &quot;Gothic coast&quot; and &quot;Gothic Scandia&quot; but prefers the latter, thinking that the former is &quot;linguistically questionable&quot;.

==Identification==
===History and linguistics===
In the 1st century AD, the mouth of the Vistula was indicated as the land of the &quot;Gutones&quot; (Pliny the Elder) or &quot;Gothones&quot; (Tacitus):

The names given by Pliny and Tacitus appear to be identical to *&quot;Gutaniz&quot;, the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form of &quot;Gutans&quot;, the Goths&#x27; and the Gotlanders&#x27; name for themselves. 

The Gothiscandza theme was revived in German scholarship by Gustav Kossinna. Several archaeologists and historians have proposed the theory that the name Gothiscandza was evolved linguistically into Kashubian and other West Slavic languages&#x27; rendition of the various historical names of Gdańsk ().

===Archaeology===

In the 1st century a new culture appeared at the mouth of the Vistula, called the Wielbark Culture replacing the local Oksywie culture. The most salient component of Scandinavian influence in the 1st century AD is the introduction of Scandinavian burial traditions such as stone circles and the stelae, showing that those who buried their dead preferred to do so according to Scandinavian traditions.

However, there is also archaeological evidence of previous Scandinavian influence in the area during the Nordic Bronze Age and the Pre-Roman Iron Age, perhaps corresponding to the arrival of Rugians and Vandals.

In the 3rd century AD, the Wielbark culture spread into Scythia, where it formed the Gothic Chernyakhov culture.

==Norse mythology==
Norse mythology presents at least two traditions that may be connected to Gothiscandza. The first one, the Gutasaga, may refer to the migration of the Goths and the second one, the legend of Dag the Wise, of raids from Scandza.

===The Gutasaga===
The Gutasaga relates that when the Gotlanders had multiplied so that the island (Gotland, i.e. &quot;Goth-land&quot;) no longer could support them, they drew lots so that one third of the island&#x27;s inhabitants had to leave and settle in the south. They eventually settled in the land of the Greeks.

:&quot;over a long time, the people descended from these three multiplied so much that the land couldn&#x27;t support them all. Then they draw lots, and every third person was picked to leave, and they could keep everything they owned and take it with them, except for their land. ... they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came to the land of the Greeks. ... they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.&quot;

===Ynglingatal===
The legend of Dag the Wise may convey traditions of attacks by the Suiones in the 2nd or 3rd century. In Scandinavian sources, the territory is called Reidgotaland, a name that followed the Goths during their migrations in the Norse sagas.

<text>Behind the Iron Curtain is a live album released by German singer Nico in 1986. It features a concert recorded at De Doelen Concertgebouw, Grote Zaal (Great Hall), in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 9 October 1985. The concert was held as part of the Pandora&#x27;s Music Box music festival.

Although the release states it was &quot;recorded live in Warsaw, Budapest and Prague between 29.9.85 and 31.10.85&quot;—thus behind the Iron Curtain—it was in fact entirely recorded at the one concert in Rotterdam. The album was released on CD in 1987 excluding the material from side three.

==Track listing==
All songs are written by Nico, except where noted.

<text>The Chemical Society was a scientific society formed in 1841 (then named the Chemical Society of London) by 77 scientists as a result of increased interest in scientific matters. Chemist Robert Warington was the driving force behind its creation.

==History==
One of the aims of the Chemical Society was to hold meetings for &quot;the communication and discussion of discoveries and observations, an account of which shall be published by the Society&quot;. In 1847, its importance was recognised by a Royal Charter, which added to its role in the advancement of science, the development of chemical applications in industry. Its members included eminent chemists from overseas including August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who became its president in 1861. Membership was open to all those interested in chemistry, but fellowship was for long restricted to men.

In 1904, Edith Humphrey, thought to be the first British woman to gain a doctorate in chemistry (at the University of Zurich), was one of nineteen women chemists to petition the Chemical Society for admission of women to fellowship. This was eventually granted in 1919, and Humphrey was subsequently elected to fellowship.

The Chemical Society of London succeeded where a number of previous chemical associations - the Lunar Society&#x27;s London branch chemical society of the 1780s, the Animal Chemical Club of 1805, the London Chemical Society of 1824 - failed. One assertion of a cause of success of the Chemical Society of London is that it was, unlike its forerunners, a &quot;fruitful amalgamation of the technological and academic chemist&quot;.

Its activities expanded over the years, including eventually becoming a major publisher in the field of chemistry. On 15 May 1980, it amalgamated with the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Faraday Society and the Society for Analytical Chemistry to become the Royal Society of Chemistry.

<text>The Broadview Anthology of Poetry () is a 1993 poetry anthology compiled by Canadian academics Herbert Rosengarten and Amanda Goldrick-Jones.

It states the aim of including a &#x27;wide range&#x27; of poetry in English, with the aim of being representative geographically and in other ways (in particular the inclusion of women). Within that brief it tries to be representative also of each of American poetry, British poetry and Canadian poetry.

<text>Casa Rocca Piccola is a 16th-century palace in Malta, and home of the noble Maltese family de Piro. It is situated in Valletta, the capital city of Malta. There are daily tours from 10am till 5pm (last admission 4pm). The palace includes a BnB with 5 rooms and a restaurant called La Giara Restaurant.

==History==
The Casa Rocca Piccola was built in 1580 an era in which the Knights of St John, having successfully fought off the invading Turks in 1565, decided to build a prestigious city to rival other European capitals such as Paris and Venice. Palaces were designed for prestige and aesthetic beauty in most of Valletta&#x27;s streets, and bastion walls fortified the new sixteenth-century city. Casa Rocca Piccola was one of two houses built in Valletta by Admiral Don Pietro la Rocca. It is referenced in maps of the time as &quot;la casa con giardino&quot; meaning, the house with the garden, as normally houses in Valletta were not allowed gardens. Changes were made in the late 18th century to divide the house into two smaller houses. Further changes were made in 1918 and before the second world war an air raid shelters was added. The Casa Rocca Piccola Family Shelter is the second air-raid shelter to be dug in Malta.

==Design and Building==
Casa Rocca Piccola was designed with long enfilades of interconnecting rooms on the first floor, while leaving the ground floor rooms for kitchens and stables. The house has over fifty rooms, including two libraries, two dining rooms, many drawing rooms, and a chapel.

==Collections==

The house is furnished with collections of furniture, silver and paintings from Malta and Europe. The de Piro family archives, Archivium de Piro, are housed in The Archive Room at Casa Rocca Piccola. They contain details records of family and state business dating from the late 16th century to the present day. These include business contracts, marriage contracts, bills, wills, and court cases. The archives have been used for research projects at the University of Malta and the University of Oxford. 

Casa Rocca Piccola houses Malta&#x27;s largest private collection of antique costumes. There is both formal and informal wear from the 18th to the 20th century. Malta has a long tradition of lace making. Casa Rocca Piccola houses the largest private collection of Maltese lace. Lace was used in different ways for different occasions, both religious and secular. Casa Rocca Piccola founded and hosts the annual HSBC Malta Lace Competition.

Casa Rocca Piccola has had tenants since the 16th century.

==Architecture==
The building saw several modifications over the years with the main design being Palladian architecture. In the early 20th century part of the garden was built, to extend the house, in the Art Deco style.

<text>Sharmba David Mitchell ( ; born August 27, 1970) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 2006. He held the WBA light welterweight title from 1998 to 2001, and the IBF interim light welterweight title in 2004.

==Professional career==
Mitchell began his professional boxing career on September 23, 1988, knocking out Eddie Colón in three rounds at Atlantic City, New Jersey.

He had a mark of 14 wins and no losses with seven knockouts - including victories over former Olympic Games bronze medalist Aristides Acevedo and over Dana Roston - when he met a former or future world champion for the first time inside a ring. On March 8, 1990, he beat the famed former world champion Rafael Limón in Atlantic City by an eight-round unanimous decision.

Mitchell kept on winning, running his record up to 27-0 with sixteen knockouts, including a victory against former world title challenger Miguel Santana. He then fought former world champion Rocky Lockridge on April 22, 1992, winning a ten-round unanimous decision.

Mitchell had recorded a 31-0 record until he lost two fights in a row to begin 1994: one against future world champion Leavander Johnson in eight rounds, then to future two-time world lightweight champion Stevie Johnston in nine rounds. He did not lose another fight in the next seven years.

After six more wins in a row, including one over future world champion Terron Millett, Mitchell fought for the WBC continental Americas light welterweight title in Dallas, Texas on April 11, 1996. He won the title by knocking out Gilberto Floes in the second round.

On May 10, 1997, Mitchell defeated Jose Rafael Barboza by a twelve-round decision in Miami, Florida to win the WBA&#x27;s Fedelatin belt in the same weight division. After two more victories, he got his first chance at winning a world title.

===WBA light welterweight champion===
On October 10, 1998, he beat Moroccan Khalid Rahilou by a twelve-round unanimous decision in Paris, France, becoming the WBA light welterweight champion.

Mitchell retained his world title four times, his last successful defense being against Puerto Rican Felix Flores on September 16, 2000, at Las Vegas. Mitchell was dropped in the first round, but he recovered and edged the challenger by two scores of 116-111 and one of 116-113.

===First fight with Tszyu===
After that fight, demand rose for a unification title bout between Mitchell and Kostya Tszyu of Australia, the WBC light welterweight champion.

The highly anticipated match took place in Las Vegas on February 3, 2001. The outcome was controversial, as Mitchell broke his knee early in the fight and he could not continue after round seven. Although Mitchell was not knocked out in a conventional way, this nevertheless counted as a knockout loss in his record.

Mitchell then fought eight bouts, winning each of them, including victories over former world champion Vince Phillips and winning the IBF super lightweight title against Lovemore N&#x27;Dou in Atlantic City New Jersey. Defending that title ounce in Manchester England. He also beat and became and the first person to have knocked down Ben Tackie.

===Rematch with Tszyu===

Negotiations for a rematch with Tszyu had been taking place long before the fights with the aforementioned rivals. Tszyu, however, had his own health problems, and the fight kept being cancelled. First scheduled for Australia and then for Moscow, the rematch finally took place on November 6, 2004, in Phoenix, Arizona. Mitchell was floored four times in the second bout with Tszyu before being stopped in round three, losing by knockout.

===Losses to Mayweather and Williams===

On November 19, 2005, Mitchell was defeated by Floyd Mayweather Jr. in their 147-lbs. non-title bout in Portland, Oregon. Mayweather dropped Mitchell in the third round with a straight right hand to the head, and again dropped him in the sixth with a hook to the body, ending the fight. During his most recent bout - against Paul Williams in Reno, Nevada, on August 19, 2006 - Mitchell was knocked down in the third round, and three times in the fourth round. Referee Richard Steele stopped the bout at 2:57 when Mitchell arose wobbly from the final knockdown. Mitchell retired for good shortly thereafter.

Mitchell finished his professional boxing career of 57 wins and 6 losses, with 30 knockout wins.

<text>The Egremont Russet is a cultivar of dessert apple, of the russet type. It has a rich, nutty flavour and crisp, firm and fairly juicy flesh.

It was first recorded in 1872, and is believed to have been raised by the Earl of Egremont at Petworth in Sussex, UK.

It was first popular in the Victorian era and has remained popular ever since. It is the third most common apple in commercial cultivation in England &amp; Wales after Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin and Bramley, although its 308ha represents just 3.7% of total apple orchards.

It is a popular garden apple in the United Kingdom (UK) and trees are widely available from UK garden centres.

<text>The Society of Public Analysts was formed in the United Kingdom in 1874 and subsequently became the Society for Analytical Chemistry. It was incorporated in 1907.

The chemical industry had grown rapidly in the 19th century, and developments in the alkali, explosive and agricultural chemical fields produced a growing need for analytical chemists. Many of these chemists had little or no training in chemistry, and their lack of expertise was a danger to the public. Shortly after the Adulteration of Food and Drink Act 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. 84) the society was formed. It established adulteration and food standards, and educated analysts in legal work.

It published &quot;The Analyst&quot;, &quot;Analytical Abstracts&quot; and the &quot;Proceedings of the Society for Analytical Chemistry&quot; (from 1964 to 1974).

In April 1966 it presented its first Gold Medal to Herbert Newton Wilson (author of An Approach To Chemical Analysis)

On 15 May 1980, it amalgamated with the Chemical Society, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, and the Faraday Society to become the Royal Society of Chemistry.

<doc id="1134759" wikidata="Q2827917" url="?curid=1134759" title="Iwama Dōjō">
<text>The Iwama Dōjō is a &quot;dōjō&quot; built by the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, who lived there from 1942 until his death in 1969. It is located in the former town of Iwama and became an important historical location for the development of aikido and &quot;a Mecca to the aikido community.&quot; This dojo is also where Morihiro Saito, one of the founder&#x27;s closest students, learned and taught aikido from 1946 until 2002 developing what is often referred to as the Iwama Style.

Iwama was a small farming village in Japan, located 100 km north-east of Tokyo and at the centre of Ibaraki prefecture. Iwama was annexed into the City of Kasama in 2006 (dissolving Nishiibaraki County, which had previously contained Iwama Town). The original Iwama aikido dojo, Aiki Shrine and the neighbouring Tanrenkan are now addressed in the Yoshioka district of Kasama city, Ibaraki.

The Iwama dojo was significantly damaged in the 2011 earthquake. The Aiki Shrine and other dojos in former Iwama Town were also affected by the disaster.

==The Ibaraki Dojo==
The Ibaraki Branch Dojo (茨城支部道場 &quot;Ibaraki Shibu Dojo&quot;), also known as the Ibaraki Dojo or the Shibu Dojo, is a small aikido dojo, run by the Aikikai Foundation.

The land on which the dojo and shrine were built was first purchased by Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido, in 1940. In 1943 he built the first part of the current Aiki Jinja and an &quot;outdoor dojo&quot; where he lived a life of &quot;Buno Ichinyo&quot; (the union of agriculture and Budō). This dojo was completed in 1945 and was originally called &quot;The Aiki Shuren Dojo&quot; (合気修練道場, lit. harmonising drill dojo). At first the dojo did not include &quot;tatami&quot; mats, and students received training directly upon the wooden floor. Eventually 24 mats were installed. The dojo was later moved to the present day location and expanded to 60 mats. When the founder formally established the Aikikai for the promotion of aikido in 1948, the dojo served as the world headquarters for the art and remained so until the opening of the new Aikikai Hombu Dojo in 1956. 

After the death of the aikido founder in 1969, Morihiro Saito became the caretaker and chief instructor at the Iwama Dojo and caretaker of the Aiki Shrine and remained so for more than thirty years. After Saito Shihan&#x27;s death in May 2002, Moriteru Ueshiba became the default Dojo Chief while Saito&#x27;s son, Hitohiro Saito, assumed the role of Acting Dojo Chief on behalf of the Dōshu. However, in November 2003, Hitohiro Sensei announced his departure from the Aikikai. Hitohiro&#x27;s organisation was formed following his formal separation from the Aikikai in November 2003. This created a split among students of Morihiro Saito with some joining Hitohira Sensei&#x27;s new organisation and others (most notably the three that Saitō had promoted to 7th dan, William Witt, Paolo Corallini, and Ulf Evenås) remaining affiliated with the Aikikai.

In December 2003, the dojo was renamed the Ibaraki Branch Dojo with Hiroshi Isoyama taking on the role of Acting Dojo Chief and Senior Instructor. Isoyama first began training in the Iwama dojo in 1949 at the age 12, as a direct student of the Morihei Ueshiba and the registration documents that he signed stated the name: &quot;Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu&quot;. Isoyama&#x27;s position was later taken over by Mitsuteru Ueshiba who then became the current Dojo Chief in place of his father in April 2015. Isoyama Shihan remains as chief instructor and Executive Advisor with support from Inagaki Shihan.

On 11 March 2011, the dojo was severely damaged by an earthquake and rendered unusable. Aikido practice continued in the Aiki Shrine from 14 March until 17 September 2011 when the newly repaired dojo reopened for training.

The Ibaraki Branch Dojo has nine regular local instructors, headed by Hiroshi Isoyama (8th dan), with the majority of the teaching (including the live-in student programme) being carried out by Shigemi Inagaki (8th Dan). Additionally, Dojo Chief Mitsuteru Ueshiba and Aikido Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba visit on Wednesdays and Saturdays respectively to teach the general class. General classes are held every day of the week for regular students while live-in students (内弟子 uchi deshi ) practise three times per day in addition to carrying out other duties such as maintaining the dojo and shrine precincts.

==Aiki Jinja==

Aiki Jinja (合気神社) is the shrine built by Morihei Ueshiba in Iwama in honor of the deities of aikido. The shrine grounds include the Ibaraki Branch dojo (training hall).

The 42 kami enshrined within the Aiki Jinja include Morihei Ueshiba&#x27;s Guardian Gods, Saruta Hiko no Ookami, Kunitsu Ryuoh Kuzuryu, Daigongen, Tajikarao no mikoto, Amenomurakumo Kukisamuhara Ryuoh, Ketsumi Miko no Ookami, Wakumusubi no Mikoto, Ryuoh, Daigongen, Ootengu, Daibosatsu, and others.

The first part of the shrine building (the &quot;Honden&quot; or &quot;Okuden&quot; housing the deities of aikido) was completed in late autumn, 1943. The second bigger part (the Haiden) was erected in front of the Honden in 1962. Both parts were renovated by care-taker Morihiro Saito in 2001-2002 with the approval of Dōshu Moriteru Ueshiba. This renovation also included a fence set up around the compound, and a stone with the carvings &quot;Aiki Jinja&quot; designed by Seiseki Abe, a master of both calligraphy and Aikido, who was also the calligraphy teacher of Morihei Ueshiba. A large statue of the founder of aikido was erected in the shrine grounds and unveiled on 8 November 2009. Surplus material from this monument was used to make a bust of the founder which was unveiled at the newly rebuilt Iwama Station on 24 July 2012.

The Torii gate and Honden were damaged during the Great Tohoku earthquake. The relatively unscathed Haiden was used for aikido training while the dojo was unusable.

When Morihei Ueshiba was alive, once a month he would preside over what was initially a small religious ceremony in the Aiki Jinja called &quot;Tsukinamisai&quot; (月並み祭), which lasted up to an hour. Food offerings of fruits, vegetables, and fish adorned the kamidana. Later, a small party with the uchi deshi (live-in students) was held inside the dojo. After Ueshiba died, caretaker Morihiro Saito took responsibility for hosting the ceremony every month on the 14th. This tradition is kept up by current Dōshu Moriteru Ueshiba.

Every year on April 29 (the start of the Japanese Golden Week holiday), the annual shrine festival &quot;Aiki Jinja Rei Taisai&quot; (合気神社例大祭　&quot;Grand Festival of the Aiki Shrine&quot;) is held by Oomoto priests in commemoration of Ueshiba&#x27;s death on April 26, 1969. Under former caretaker Morihiro Saito, the event grew to become a very big day for the small town of Iwama. The festival has continued to attract hundreds of Aikido practitioners to the small dojo and shrine under current Dojo Chief Moriteru Ueshiba.

The Aiki Shrine Festival usually starts with a &quot;shubatsu&quot;　(a Shinto ritual), &quot;taisai-shukuji&quot;　(ritual felicitations) and &quot;tamagushi-hoten&quot; (offering of sacred sprigs) by the Ueshiba family and representatives from the aikido world and local community. The attendees then take part in a ritual prayer and memorial service offered by the Ueshiba family and other dignitaries. A special Shinto prayer called the &quot;Amatsu Norito&quot; is recited before the current Dōshu makes a speech and a ritual demonstration of Aikido called a &quot;hōnō embu&quot; (奉納演武) within the haiden of the shrine. The festival usually closes with &quot;naorai&quot; (a celebratory meal) in the dojo and surrounding gardens, often with the azaleas in bloom.

==Tanrenkan==
Tanrenkan (鍛錬館) is an aikido training hall run by Hitohiro Saito, now Hitohira, who is the son of Morihiro Saito. It is the main dojo of the Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-Kai organisation. The Tanrenkan was built in 2000 on Saito family land and exists independently of the original Iwama dojo.

==Other Iwama dojo==
There are also other aikido dojos in former-Iwama:
* Shin-Shin Aiki Juku (神信合氣塾) is located 700 metres south-east from Tanrenkan. It is the old &quot;Shin Dojo&quot; built by Saito Morihiro Shihan. Uchi-deshi from Tanrenkan stay here.
* Nisshinkan is a small dojo operated by Nemoto Hiroki (Aikikai 7th dan) next to his &quot;Aiki House&quot; student accommodation.
* There is also aikido at Iwama Budokan (Martial Arts Hall). It is located at Iwama Junior High School, 1.3 km north-east from the founder&#x27;s dojo. It is used by Watahiki (Ibaraki Branch), Nemoto and ISSASK.

<text>Sir James Caird (10 July 1816 – 9 February 1892) was a Scottish agriculturist, agricultural writer and politician. His views were based on economic liberalism which led to him forming an advisory relationship to Sir Robert Peel and later under Benjamin Disraeli. He examined the Irish famine and still later served on the commission to examine the famines in India.

==Life==

Born at Stranraer, the son of James Caird and Isabella McNeil, Caird was educated at Edinburgh High School and University of Edinburgh. He was Member of Parliament for Dartmouth from 1857 to 1859 and for Stirling Burghs from 1859 to 1865.

He started as a progressive farmer at Baldoon and then became a land-owner at Kirkcudbrightshire. He grew to become a voice of the free-trade farmer and thus represented economic liberalism of the period. In 1849, he wrote &quot;High Farming as the best Substitute for Protection.&quot; The work caught the attention of the Conservative Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, who saw Caird as a well-informed commentator. Peel invited Caird to examine agriculture and the famine in Ireland. Caird subsequently represented the &quot;Peelite&quot; position on economics and famine relief. In 1850 he wrote &quot;The Plantation Scheme: Or, the West of Ireland as a Field of Investment.&quot; He toured America, and Canada.

He was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865 and President of the Royal Statistical Society in 1880-1882 and was made a Privy Counsellor in 1889. Caird travelled to India from October 1878 to join a commission of famine inspectors. He held opinions that the Indian administrators did not appreciate. He was of the opinion that famine relief should be aimed to save life and was against fitness tests and wage payment against work for Indians. He believed that Indian governance needed fundamental change with peasants receiving payment in kind with handling of harvest variability. He even considered that land revenue superstructure including the Indian Civil Services needed pruning or even abolition. He was senior member of the Land Commission in 1882. He was director of the land department of the Board of Agriculture from 1889 to 1891.

He was appointed a CB in 1869 and promoted to KCB in 1882.

He died on 9 February 1892 and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

==Family==

In 1865 he married Elizabeth Jane Dudgeon (1826-1899), daughter of Robert Dudgeon of Hastings. She is buried alongside her husband.

<doc id="1134822" wikidata="Q1276322" url="?curid=1134822" title="Mohe people">
<text>The Mohe, Malgal, Mogher, or Mojie were historical groups of people that once occupied parts of what is now Northeast Asia during late antiquity. The two most well known Mohe groups were known as the Heishui Mohe, located along the Amur River, and the Sumo Mohe, named after the Songhua River. They have been traditionally defined by the approximate use of what would have been Tungusic languages. The Heishui Mohe are commonly thought as being direct ancestors to the 12th century Jurchens. The Tang documented the Mohe as inhabiting the land of Sushen, to the northeast of the Tang, east of the Turks, and north of Goguryeo.

The Mohe constituted a major part of the population in the kingdom of Balhae in northeast Asia, which lasted from the late 7th century to early 10th century. After the fall of Balhae, few historical traces of the Mohe can be found, though they are considered to be the primary ethnic group from whom the Jurchen people descended. The Heishui Mohe in particular are considered to be the direct ancestors of the Jurchens, from whom the 17th century Manchu people and Qing dynasty founders originated. The Mohe practiced a sedentary agrarian lifestyle and were predominantly farmers who grew soybean, wheat, millet, and rice, supplemented by pig raising and hunting for meat. The Mohe were also known to have worn pig and dog skin coats.

==Name==
The Chinese exonym &quot;Mohe&quot; (靺鞨) is a graphic pejorative written with &quot;mo&quot; 靺 &quot;socks; stockings&quot; and &quot;he&quot; 鞨 &quot;shoes&quot;. &quot;Mo&quot; (靺) (Middle Chinese: ) is an adjective, a customary expression meaning &quot;barbarian&quot; or Xiongnu. Before the Five dynasties period, it was recorded as &quot;靺羯&quot;, such as on the Honglujing Stele. 

&quot;He&quot; 鞨 is &quot;gal&quot; (Middle Chinese &quot;gat&quot; or ), meaning &quot;stone&quot; by Mohe/Malgal, Jie/Gal language. The Jie ruler Shi Le (石勒) takes the surname &quot;shi&quot; (石 &quot;stone&quot;) from &quot;gal&quot;. According to the History of Jin (Jin Shi), Shi Tumen (石土門) is the prince of the Jurchen people, whose surname &quot;shi&quot; hints to a connection with the Mohe and Jie.

The ethnonym of the Mohe bears a notable resemblance to that of the later historically attested *Motgit in Middle Chinese (; Korean: 물길 [Mulgil]; Japanese: もつきつ [Motsukitsu]).

The name of the Mohe also appears as &quot;Maka&quot; in &quot;Shin-Maka&quot; (Japanese 新靺鞨, しんまか) or &quot;New Mohe,&quot; which is the name of a dance and the musical piece that accompanies it; the dance and song were introduced to the Japanese court during the Nara period or around the beginning of the Heian period from the Balhae kingdom. In modern Japanese historical texts, the name of the Mohe is annotated with the &quot;kana&quot; reading Makkatsu (まっかつ), which is probably a transliteration based on the standard Sino-Japanese readings of the Chinese characters used to transcribe the ethnonym of the Mohe.

==Tribes==

According to some records, there were seven or maybe eight Mohe tribes :

<text>Alfold is a village and civil parish in Surrey, England on the West Sussex border. Alfold is a dispersed or polyfocal village in the Green Belt, which is buffered from all other settlements. The Greensand Way runs north of the village along the Greensand Ridge and two named localities exist to the north and south of the historic village centre which features pubs, a set of stocks and a whipping post.

Alfold Crossways has a country park, recreational ground and a garden centre whereas Alfold&#x27;s centre has a village store and the Anglican parish church. The population was 1,059 in the 2011 UK census.

==Etymology==
Alfold—also recorded as Aldfold or Awfold—meant the &quot;old fold&quot; or clearing enclosure for cattle, which is apt as it was in a much-wooded area of The Weald (meaning forest in Old and Middle English) prior to being cleared for farming.

==History==
Early glass making, evidence of which can be seen in Sidney Wood, appears to provide the oldest trace of land use in the village. The glass industry in Alfold ended around 1615 when using charcoal was banned in glass production.

Alfold is not mentioned in the Domesday Book. This is probably because Alfold appears to have been an unrecorded, southern outpost in the multi-village estate of Bramley since pre-conquest times. The earliest mention of Alfold, in the 13th century, records that it was attached to Shalford Manor. A charter of William Longespee, son of the Earl of Salisbury, records that the advowson, with the Manor of Shalford, is given to John, son of Geoffrey Earl of Essex, who died in 1256.

Four manors existed, namely Wildwood now represented by Great and Little Wildwood Farms and Wildwood Copse and Moat, was formerly possessed by the lords of Albury and Stoke D&#x27;Abernon, the D&#x27;Abernons and their successors. In the 13th century they had land in Alfold and in a deed of 1313 John D&#x27;Abernon&#x27;s wood called &quot;le Wylwode&quot; is mentioned. Markwick and Monkenhook over their history have been held by Waverley Abbey, Viscount Montagu and the Earl of Onslow; and Sydney alias Hedgecourt or Rickhurst (Rykhurst) lies partly in Dunsfold held by the Sydney (then Dorrington) family.

Alfold Park, formerly with a moat (as did Wildwood Farm), belonged to the manor of Shalford and contained ; however it lost its park before John Speed&#x27;s map was made in the reign of James I.

After the invention of gunpowder, charcoal was extensively burnt in the parish for gunpowder works in Dunsfold, Cranleigh, and Sussex.

The parish comprised of which only in 1848 were common or waste, and 

A Baptist chapel was erected in 1883, and an elementary school in 1876.

Significant other homes mentioned in 1911 were Sydney Manor and Sachel Court; Sachel Court was owned by Thomas Smith Wharrie, an engineer in Scotland and director of British Mutual Banking Company Ltd.

<doc id="1134836" wikidata="Q734568" url="?curid=1134836" title="Stoolball">
<text>Stoolball is a sport that dates back to at least the 15th century, originating in Sussex, southern England. It is considered a &quot;traditional striking and fielding sport&quot; and may be an ancestor of cricket (a game it resembles in some respects), baseball, softball, and rounders. The sport has been called &quot;cricket in the air&quot;. There is evidence to suggest that it was played as a tradition by milkmaids who used their milking stools as a &quot;wicket&quot; and the bittle, or milk bowl as a bat, hence its archaic name of &quot;bittle-battle.&quot;

The sport of stoolball is strongly associated with Sussex and has been referred to as Sussex&#x27;s &#x27;national&#x27; sport and a Sussex game or pastime. The National Stoolball Association was formed in 1979 to promote and expand stoolball. The game was officially recognised as a sport by the Sports Council in early 2008. The National Stoolball Association changed its name to Stoolball England in 2010 on the advice of the Sports Council and was recognised as the national governing body for stoolball in England in 2011. The organisation is recognised by Sport England.

The game&#x27;s popularity has faded since the 1960s, but continues to be played at a local league level in Sussex, Kent, Surrey and the Midlands. Some variants are played in some schools. Teams can be ladies only or mixed. There are ladies&#x27; leagues in Sussex, Surrey and Kent and mixed leagues in Sussex.

==History==
===Medieval and Tudor references===
Stoolball is attested by name as early as 1450. Nearly all medieval references describe it as a game played during Easter celebrations, typically as a courtship pastime rather than a competitive game. The game&#x27;s associations with romance remained strong into the modern period. Written by William Shakespeare and the Sussex-born playwright John Fletcher, the comedy, &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; used the phrase &quot;playing stool ball&quot; as a euphemism for sexual behaviour.

===Early competitions and establishment of codes===
Stoolball makes an appearance in the dictionary of Samuel Johnson, where it is defined as a game played by driving a ball from stool to stool.

Stoolball seems to have been one of the earliest sports in which women participated. Activities for women before about 1870 were recreational rather than sport-specific in nature. They were typically non-competitive, informal, rule-less; they emphasised physical activity rather than competition. In contrast, stoolball allowed women to participate in competitive sport.

A &quot;fine match of stoolball&quot; is recorded as having been played in June 1747 by a total of 28 women at Warbleton. The first inter-county stoolball match took place between the women of Sussex and Kent in 1797 at Tunbridge Wells Common on the historic border between the two counties. Sussex women wore blue ribbons to represent the county while the women of Kent wore pink ribbons.

Sussex historian Andrew Lusted has argued that between 1866 and 1887 the Glynde Butterflies stoolball team were the first women in England to be considered sports stars. In 1866 the first recorded stoolball match took place between teams of named women representing villages as the Glynde Butterflies took on the Firle Blues. Other teams included the Chailey Grasshoppers, Selmeston Harvest Bugs, Waldron Bees, Eastbourne Seagulls, Danny Daisies and Westmeston.

The sport&#x27;s modern rules were codified at Glynde in 1881 where the two slightly different sets of rules in the east and the west of Sussex were brought together. In 1867 the rules in the east of the county were compiled by the Rev William de St Croix, the vicar of Glynde, and were the first rules to be established.

===20th century revival===
A Sussex Stoolball League was established in 1903. Initially played by women only, men joined in shortly afterwards. Modern stoolball is centred on Sussex where the game was revived in the early 20th century by Major William Grantham. Grantham wore a traditional Sussex round frock and beaver hat to stoolball games. In 1917, Sussex County Cricket Ground in Hove hosted a match between young men who had lost one arm in First World War action at a temporary hospital in Brighton&#x27;s Royal Pavilion, &quot;damaged by wounds&quot;, and a team of older lawyers, &quot;damaged by age&quot;. The soldiers won and were deemed to be &#x27;heroes&#x27;. In 1919 a demonstration match was held at Lord&#x27;s and the game was also played near the trenches of the battlefields of the First World War.

First played in 1923, the League Championship Challenge Cup is open to the winning teams of the five leagues of the Sussex County Stoolball Association - North, East, West, Mid and Central. By the 1930s stoolball was being played in the Midlands and the north of England. Since 1938 Sussex and Kent have competed annually for the Rose Bowl, which was presented to Sussex by Major William Grantham. This is sometimes a team representing Sussex and sometimes one of Sussex&#x27;s five leagues may represent the county against Kent. Grantham founded the Stoolball Association of Great Britain at Lord&#x27;s in 1923. By 1927 over 1,000 clubs were playing stoolball across England, however in 1942 the Stoolball Association of Great Britain ceased to function. The National Stoolball Association was founded on 3 October 1979 at Clair Hall in Haywards Heath attended by 23 people from nine different leagues. On the advice of the Sports Council the governing body was renamed Stoolball England in 2010.

In the early 20th century stoolball was also played outside England, including in France, Japan and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

==Description and rules==
Stoolball is played on grass with a diameter boundary, and the pitch is long. Each team consists of 11 players, with one team fielding and the other batting. Bowling is underarm from a bowling &quot;crease&quot; from the batter&#x27;s wicket, with the ball reaching the batter on the full as in rounders or baseball rather than bouncing from the pitch as in cricket. Each over consists of 8 balls. The &quot;wicket&quot; itself is a square piece of wood at head or shoulder height fastened to a post. Traditionally this was the seat of a stool hung from a post or tree; some versions used a tall stool placed upright on the ground.

As it is played today, a bowler attempts to hit the wicket with the ball, and a batter defends it using a bat shaped like a frying pan. The batter scores &quot;runs&quot; by running between the wickets or hitting the ball beyond the boundary in a similar way to cricket. A ball hit over the boundary counts for 4 runs if it has hit the ground before reaching the boundary, or 6 runs if it landed beyond the boundary upon first contact with the ground. Fielders attempt to catch the ball or run out the batter by hitting the wicket with the ball before the batter returns from her or his run.

Originally the batter simply had to defend her or his stool from each ball with a hand and would score a point for each delivery until the stool was hit. The game later evolved to include runs and bats.

==Confusion with the game of Stoball==
According to Alice Gomme, early records have shown that the game was called Stobball or Stoball and was a game peculiar to North Wiltshire, North Gloucestershire, and a little part of Somerset, near Bath. However, although the 17th century antiquarian John Aubrey described a game called &quot;stobball&quot; played in this area, his description of it does not appear to be stoolball. Another contemporary text from the same region characterises &quot;stoball&quot; as a game played mainly by men and boys. 

The Oxford English Dictionary considers it unlikely that &quot;stool ball&quot; could have been corrupted into &quot;stobball&quot;. Stobball could very well instead be the game Willughby called &quot;stow-ball,&quot; which resembled golf.

<text>Gerald Davis (23 February 1930 – 31 August 1991) was a British television writer, best known for his contributions to the science-fiction genre. He also wrote for the soap operas &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;United!&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
From 1966 until the following year, Davis was the story editor of the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, for which he created the character Jamie McCrimmon and co-created the popular cybernetic monsters known as the Cybermen, who continue to make appearances in the show, having been revived in the new run. His fellow co-creator of these creatures was the programme&#x27;s unofficial scientific adviser, Dr. Kit Pedler. 

Davis briefly returned to writing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1975, penning the original script for &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;, though the transmitted version was heavily rewritten by then script-editor Robert Holmes. Davis also adapted several of his scripts into novelisations for Target Books&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; range. 

===&quot;Doomwatch&quot;===
Following their work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Davis and Pedler teamed up in 1970 to create the science-fiction programme &quot;Doomwatch&quot;. &quot;Doomwatch&quot; ran for three seasons on BBC1 from 1970 to 1972 and spawned a novel written by Davis and Pedler, a subsequent cinema film and a 1999 revival on Channel 5.

With Pedler he wrote the science-fiction novels &quot;Mutant 59: The Plastic Eater&quot; (1971), expanded from their script for the first episode of &quot;Doomwatch&quot;; &quot;Brainrack&quot; (1974); and &quot;The Dynostar Menace&quot; (1975).

==Later work==
In the 1980s Davis worked in America both in television and on feature films such as &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980). In late 1989 he and Terry Nation made a joint but unsuccessful bid to take over production of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and reformat the series mainly for the American market. 

==Death==
Davis died on 31 August 1991.

<doc id="1134855" wikidata="Q632336" url="?curid=1134855" title="S3 Graphics">
<text>S3 Graphics, Ltd. was an American computer graphics company. The company sold the Trio, ViRGE, Savage, and Chrome series of graphics processors. Struggling against competition from 3dfx Interactive, ATI and Nvidia, it merged with hardware manufacturer Diamond Multimedia in 1999. The resulting company renamed itself to SONICblue Incorporated, and, two years later, the graphics portion was spun off into a new joint effort with VIA Technologies. The new company focused on the mobile graphics market. VIA Technologies&#x27; stake in S3 Graphics was purchased by HTC in 2011.

==History==

S3 was founded and incorporated in January 1989 by Dado Banatao and Ronald Yara. It was named S3 as it was Banatao&#x27;s third startup company. 

The company&#x27;s first products were among the earliest graphical user interface (GUI) accelerators. These chips were popular with video card manufacturers, and their followup designs, including the Trio64, made strong inroads with OEMs. S3 took over the high end 2D market just prior to the popularity of 3D accelerators.

S3&#x27;s first 3D accelerator chips, the ViRGE series, controlled half of the market early on but could not compete against the high end 3D accelerators from ATI, Nvidia, and 3Dfx. In some cases, the chips performed worse than software-based solutions without an accelerator. As S3 lost market share, their offerings competed in the mid-range market. Their next design, the Savage 3D, was released early and suffered from driver issues, but it introduced S3TC, which became an industry standard. S3 bought Number Nine&#x27;s assets in 1999, then merged with Diamond Multimedia. The resulting company renamed itself SONICblue, refocused on consumer electronics, and sold its graphics business to VIA Technologies. Savage-derived chips were integrated into numerous VIA motherboard chipsets. Subsequent discrete derivations carried the brand names DeltaChrome and GammaChrome.

In July 2011, HTC Corporation announced they were buying VIA Technologies&#x27; stake in S3 Graphics, thus becoming the majority owner of S3 Graphics. In November, the United States International Trade Commission ruled against S3 in a patent dispute with Apple.

==Graphics controllers==
* S3 911, 911A (June 10, 1991) - S3&#x27;s first Windows accelerators (16/256-color, high-color acceleration)
* S3 924 - 24-bit true-color acceleration
* S3 801, 805, 805i - mainstream DRAM VLB Windows accelerators (16/256-color, high-color acceleration)
* S3 928 - 24/32-bit true-color acceleration, DRAM or VRAM
* S3 805p, 928p - S3&#x27;s first PCI support
* S3 Vision864, Vision964 (1994) - 2nd generation Windows accelerators (64-bit wide framebuffer). Support MPEG-1 video acceleration.
* S3 Vision868, Vision968 - S3&#x27;s first motion video accelerator (zoom and YUV→RGB conversion)
* S3 Trio 32, 64, 64V+, 64V2 (1995) - S3&#x27;s first integrated (RAMDAC+VGA) accelerator. The 64-bit versions were S3&#x27;s most successful product range.
* ViRGE (no suffix), VX, DX, GX, GX2, Trio3D, Trio3D/2X - S3&#x27;s first Windows 3D-accelerators. Notoriously poor 3D. Sold well to OEMs mainly because of low price and excellent 2D-performance.
* Savage 3D (1998), 4 (1999), 2000 (2000) - S3&#x27;s first recognizably modern 3D hardware implementation. Poor yields meant actual clock speeds were 30% below expectations, and buggy drivers caused further problems. S3 Texture Compression went on to become an industry standard, and the Savage3D&#x27;s DVD acceleration was market leading at introduction. Savage2000 was announced as the first chip with integrated Transformation and Lighting (S3TL) co-processor.
* Aurora64V+, S3 ViRGE/MX, SuperSavage, SavageXP - Mobile chipsets
* ProSavage, Twister, UniChrome, Chrome 9 - Integrated implementations of Savage chipset for VIA motherboards
* GammaChrome, DeltaChrome, Chrome 20 series, Chrome 440 series, Chrome 500 series - Discrete cards post acquisition by VIA. 
* S3 GenDAC, SDAC - VGA RAMDAC with high/true-color bypass (SDAC had integrated PLLs, dot-clocks, and hardware Windows cursor)

=== Media chipsets ===
* Sonic/AD sound chipset - A programmable, sigma-delta audio DAC, featuring an integrated PLL, stereo 16-bit analogue output
* SonicVibes - PCI Audio Accelerator
* Scenic/MX2 - MPEG Decoder

<text>Volodymyr Mykhailovych Lytvyn (, ; born April 28, 1956) is a Ukrainian politician best known for being Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Having previously served in that position from 2002 until 2006, he was re-elected in December 2008 after his party agreed to join the former coalition of Yulia Tymoshenko in an expanded capacity and stayed Chairman until December 2012. From 1994 to 1999, Lytvyn was the aide to President Leonid Kuchma and, later, the head of his office.

==Early biography and private life==

Lytvyn was born in Sloboda-Romanivska village in the Novohrad-Volynskyi Raion of the Zhytomyr Oblast. Lytvyn graduated from the Kyiv University (Faculty of History) in 1978. In 1984, he defended his dissertation &quot;Efforts of the Communist Party of Ukraine in improving the preparation of teachers in social disciplines&quot;.

Lytvyn started his career at the Kyiv State University (1978−86), then he worked as Head of Directorate in the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Vocational Training of the Ukrainian SSR (1986−89). Between 1989 and 1991 he worked as a political analyst at the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian branch of CPSU.

Lytvyn is a correspondent member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Honored Worker of Sciences and Technology of Ukraine. However, in 2002 he was publicly and reasonably accused of plagiarizing a Western scholar when writing his article to Dzerkalo Tyzhnia newspaper.

He is married to Tetyana Kostyantynivna (born 1960), an economist. Their daughter Olena (born 1982) is a beauty industry entrepreneur, and their son Ivan (born 1989) is a student.

Lytvyn&#x27;s hobbies include reading, football, and taking care of dalmatian dogs.

==Political career==
===Head of the Presidential Administration===
In 1994, Lytvyn became the aide to the newly elected President Leonid Kuchma. In 1999, he was appointed as the head of the Presidential Administration.

====Gongadze murder====
During the Cassette Scandal audiotapes were released on which Kuchma, Lytvyn and other top-level administration officials are allegedly heard discussing the need to silence Georgiy Gongadze for his online news reports about high-level corruption. Gongadze&#x27;s decapitated body was found in the suburbs of Kyiv in November 2000. In 2000, Mykola Melnychenko released a secretly-taped recording allegedly of a conversation between Kuchma and Lytvyn in which the two discussed getting rid of Gongadze. Lytvyn is alleged to have said that Kuchma should &quot;let loose [Interior Minister] Kravchenko to use alternative methods&quot; on Gongadze. Lytvyn denied the allegation, saying that the tape was a fabrication. Independent experts who have analysed the tapes are divided as to their authenticity. Gongadze was found beheaded in a shallow grave in 2000. In 2005, Kravchenko was found dead with two bullets in his head. Official investigations concluded that he had committed suicide and that he had ordered Gongadze&#x27;s murder. Lytvyn stated &quot;The investigation confirmed my innocence in this case, despite the fact that efforts have been, are being and will be taken to make me practically the main person accused [of killing the journalist]&quot;.

During the 2011—2013 trial of Oleksiy Pukach, Pukach claimed that (former) Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Lytvyn (at the time of the murder Kuchma&#x27;s head of his Presidential Administration) had ordered the murder of Gongadze.

===Parliamentary career===
In 2002, Lytvyn was elected to Verkhovna Rada as the head of the party bloc For United Ukraine (&quot;Za edynu Ukrainu&quot;). He became the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (speaker) of the legislature as a compromising figure among the parliamentary factions.

Lytvyn refused to take part in the presidential election of 2004 despite his significant political influence.

Lytvyn&#x27;s brother, Mykola Lytvyn was the chief of Ukraine&#x27;s Border Guard.

Lytvyn is known for his ironic political expressions. One of his best-known sentences is &quot;I do not protest at forming an artificial majority in our parliament. But I want this majority to include every member of parliament.&quot;

At the parliamentary elections on March 26, 2006, his Lytvyn&#x27;s People&#x27;s Bloc won 2.44% of the popular vote and no seats since it did not meet the 3 percent threshold. Lytvyn&#x27;s allies (together with other parties) declared the voting results forged, filing a court suit and starting a public campaign. However, Lytvyn himself avoids press and shows deep disappointment since the results announced. Elected vice-chairman NAN.

In the early parliamentary election held on September 30, 2007, the Lytvyn Bloc (renamed from Lytvyn&#x27;s People&#x27;s Bloc) consisted of the People&#x27;s Party and the Labour Party. The bloc placed fifth with 20 out of 450 seats.

===2010 presidential election, and 2012–14 parliamentary elections===
On December 6, 2009, Mykola Melnychenko, former bodyguard to Kuchma, accused Lytvyn of ordering the murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze in 2000. A spokesperson for Lytvyn dismissed the claims as part of the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election campaign. During the election Lytvyn received 2,35% of the votes.

Lytvyn took part in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election as a People&#x27;s Party candidate in single-member districts number 65 (first-past-the-post wins a parliament seat) located in Narodychi Raion. He won a parliamentary seat by winning this constituency. Lytvyn did not join any parliamentary faction after taking his seat.

In the 2014 parliamentary election Lytvyn was re-elected into parliament as an independent candidate in electoral district 65 located in Zviahel with 41.48% of the votes. In parliament, he joined the parliamentary group People&#x27;s Will until he was asked to leave it on 19 October 2017.

===2019 parliamentary elections and end of political career===
In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election Lytvyn lost his parliamentary seat after losing his constituency. He gained 25.65% of the votes, while the winner Dmytro Kostiuk of the Servant of the People party scored 35.73%.

In March 2021 Lytvyn lost in the election for the rector of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, taking fourth place with a result of about 4% of the vote. The next day he resigned as chairman of the supervisory board of this university.

<doc id="1134865" wikidata="Q5297202" url="?curid=1134865" title="Door furniture">
<text>Door furniture (British and Australian English) or door hardware (North American English) refers to any of the items that are attached to a door or a drawer to enhance its functionality or appearance.


Design of door furniture is an issue to disabled persons who might have difficulty opening or using some kinds of door, and to specialists in interior design as well as those usability professionals which often take their didactic examples from door furniture design and use.

Items of door furniture fall into several categories, described below.

==Hinges==

A hinge is a component that attaches one edge of a door to the frame, while allowing the other edge to swing from it. It usually consists of a pair of plates, each with a set of open cylindrical rings (the knuckles) attached to them. The knuckles of the two plates are offset from each other and mesh together. A hinge pin is then placed through the two sets of knuckles and usually fixed, to combine the plates and make the hinge a single unit. One door usually has about three hinges, but it can vary.

==Handles==

Doors generally have at least one fixed handle, usually accompanied with a latch (see below). A typical &quot;handle set&quot; is composed of the exterior handle, escutcheon, an independent deadbolt, and the interior package (knob or lever). On some doors the latch is incorporated into a hinged handle that releases when pulled on.

See also:
* Doorknob – A knob or lever on an axle that is rotated to release the bolt;
* Crash bar or Panic bar;
* Flush pull handle for sliding glass door.

==Locks==

A lock is a device that prevents access by those without a key or combination, generally by preventing one or more latches from being operated. Often accompanied by an escutcheon. Some doors, particularly older ones, will have a keyhole accompanying the lock.

==Fasteners==
Functionally, all but swinging doors use some form of fastener to hold them closed. Typical forms of fasteners include:

* Latch – A device that allows one to fasten a door from one side (but, if designed to, open from either).
* Bolt – A (nearly always) metal shaft attached by cleats or a specific form of bracket, that slides into the jamb to fasten a door.
** Draw bolt - A form of crossbar latch where a bolt, held in place by metal bails, is slid to engage a bail fixed to a jamb or mating door. A small, typically knob, handle is affixed to the bolt to aid grip. An Aldrop is similar, but incorporates a slot through the handle which can engage a hasp for securing the bolt with a lock.
** Latch bolt – A bolt that has an angled surface that acts as a wedge to push the bolt in while the door is being closed. By the use of a latch bolt, a door can be closed without having to operate the handle.
** Deadbolt – Deadbolts usually extend deeper into the frame and are not automatically retractable the way latch bolts are. They are typically manipulated with a lock on the outside and either a lock or a latch on the inside. Deadbolts are generally used for security purposes on external doors in case somebody tries to force the door in or use tools such as a crowbar, hammer, screwdriver, etc.
===Fastener accessories===
* Strike plate – A plate with a hole in the middle made to receive a bolt. If the strike is for a latch bolt, it typically also includes a small ramped area to help the bolt move inward while the door is being closed. &quot;(Also known as just &quot;strike&quot;)&quot; It&#x27;s also available as electric strike which allows you to open the door even though the mechanical lock is locked.

<text>Thomas Sutton (1532 – 12 December 1611) was an English civil servant and businessman, born in Knaith, Lincolnshire. He is remembered as the founder of the London Charterhouse and of Charterhouse School.

==Life==
Sutton was the son of an official of the city of Lincoln, and was educated at Eton College and at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. For much of his life he held the prestigious role of Master of the Ordnance in the North, which meant that he was responsible for military supplies and fortification in the north of England. He also obtained the lease of the manors of Whickham and Gateshead, just south of Newcastle, in 1578, and so gained much of his early wealth from the coal mines in the area and from the sale of this lease five years later.

In 1582, he married Elizabeth, the daughter of John Gardiner of Chalfont St Giles, Bucks and the widow of John Dudley of Stoke Newington. Dudley was a distant cousin of the earls of Warwick and Leicester, who had amassed a considerable fortune and this marriage more than doubled Sutton&#x27;s annual rent income.

Sutton&#x27;s connections to the Dudley family were strong throughout his life. Early in his career, Sutton had held a post under the Earl of Warwick, who then helped him to the post of Master of Ordnance in the North in 1569, and the Earl of Leicester, a favourite of Elizabeth I, was instrumental in gaining Sutton the lease of Whickham and Gateshead.

Sutton bought Howard House from the Earl of Suffolk, which occupied the site of a former Carthusian Monastery on the outskirts of the City of London. Although dissolved by Henry VIII, parts of the monastery still survived. Sutton also purchased the manor of Castle Campes in Cambridgeshire, which had been in possession of the de Vere family for over five hundred years, and, among other landholdings, he also owned the manors of Haddock, Littlebury, and Balsham, all near Saffron Walden in Essex.

In 1588 Sutton contributed £100 to defend the realm against the Spanish Armada, and it has been suggested he owned, and perhaps commanded, &quot;The Sutton&quot;, a barque of seventy tons and thirty men out of Weymouth, which captured a Spanish vessel and her cargo (estimated value of £20,000).

Later in his career, Sutton became one of the chief moneylenders in England, securing loans worth as little as a few shillings and as much as thousands of pounds to everyone from farmers to some of the most prominent courtiers, businesspeople, and politicians of his era, including Lord Burghley, Sir Edward Coke, Sir Percival Willoughby, Lord Compton, and the Earl of Sussex, among others, generally at the standard rate of ten percent per annum.

Sutton died on 12 December 1611 at his house in Homerton. He was then considered one of the richest individuals in England, with an estate worth approximately £4,836 per annum; and his accounts showed that he was personally worth over £50,000, mostly in the form of outstanding obligations and recognizances from the many people in debt to him. This immense wealth earned Sutton the nicknames among his contemporaries of &quot;Croesus&quot; and &quot;Riche Sutton&quot;.

==Legacy==
Sutton left part of his fortune to be invested in establishing an almshouse for 80 impoverished gentlemen, combined with a school for 40 boys, on the site of his house off Charterhouse Square, on the outskirts of the City of London. This institution was to be named the Hospital of King James in Charterhouse, although it later became known as Sutton&#x27;s Hospital in Charterhouse. The almshouse survives on the original site; while the school, now Charterhouse School, relocated to Godalming, Surrey, in 1872. The London buildings were badly damaged by bombs during the Second World War, but were restored during the 1950s.

Sutton&#x27;s personal arms, blazoned &quot;Or, on a chevron between three annulets gules three crescents of the field&quot;, are still used by the school.

John Aubrey is responsible for the almost certainly spurious legend that Sutton was the original of Volpone the fox in Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;Volpone&quot;.

<doc id="1134871" wikidata="Q1354681" url="?curid=1134871" title="Hitohiro Saito">
<text>Hitohiro Saito (斎藤 仁弘 &quot;Saitō Hitohiro&quot;, born 12 February 1957 in Iwama) is an aikido instructor and founding headmaster of Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-kai. Hitohiro is the son of Morihiro Saito. At age seven, he started to learn aikido from Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido, who cared for him as a grandson.. After Ueshiba died in 1969, he continued his practice with his father. The younger Saito became an official instructor of the Iwama dojo in 1986 and remained so until 2004 when he separated from the Aikikai organization and formed his own group. Since 2009 he is also identified as Hitohira (仁平) Saito.

==Personal history==
Years before his father&#x27;s death, Hitohiro took over the main work at the Founder&#x27;s dojo and Shrine of Aiki, Aiki Jinja, thus relieving his aging father of the great amount of work required in running the campus. His father spent his last years taking care of the vegetable gardens and travelling abroad for seminars. The main teaching of the dojo was passed to Hitohiro&#x27;s hands and remained so until 2004. In 2000, he inaugurated his own dojo, the Tanrenkan (鍛錬館), sponsored by his father Morihiro Saito. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Hitohiro inherited his house and his dojo, then called the &quot;Shin Dojo&quot;, built in 1990.

==Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-kai==
Hitohiro Saito is the founder and leader of a traditional Iwama style aikido organization. It is named Iwama Shin-Shin Aiki Shuren-kai (岩間神信合氣修練会, abbreviated as ISSASK). It has dojo in about 20 countries.

With the passing of Morihiro Saito in May 2002, Hitohiro Saito initially continued to govern the Founder&#x27;s dojo and the Shrine of Aikido, Aikijinja. He also prepared to surrender these roles to the Aikikai, which owns those properties. However, the Dōshu also requested that Iwama Ryu grading certificates no longer be issued, and in return Hitohiro asked for the Aikikai to announce in publication that the Founder&#x27;s original style is preserved at Iwama. The latter did not occur, and Hitohiro also came under pressures within the Iwama group. In November 2003, Hitohiro separated from the Aikikai. By February 2004 he had formed his own organisation (ISSASK).

While a number of Morihiro Saito&#x27;s students preferred to remain affiliated with the Aikikai, others decided to follow Hitohiro Saito upon his break from the organization. Today he teaches full-time at his own Tanrenkan and travels constantly inside Japan and around the world, instructing at seminars attended by hundreds of aikido students each month.

==Aikido style==
Saito&#x27;s Aikido is known for being precise, austere and dynamic; he emphasizes aiki-jō and aiki-ken. As a teacher he is demanding, always insisting in the deep studies of the basis of Aikido as the only way to get to understand the Aikido of the Founder and of his father Morihiro Saito.

==Personal life==
Saito is also a professional chef, calligrapher, painter, and sculptor. In his atelier, he carves mostly traditional Japanese masks and &quot;shishigashira&quot; (獅子頭, lion masks). His wife and children also practice daily at his dojo, and in 2016 his sons began teaching Aikido seminars internationally.

It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the L&#x27;Hoest&#x27;s monkey (&quot;A. lhoesti&quot;).

Preuss&#x27;s monkey is currently classified as a member of the genus &quot;Allochrocebus&quot;. It was formerly considered a member of the genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot;.

The diet of Preuss&#x27;s monkey is primarily fruit, leaves and insects, although the species occasionally raids human crops. It is darkish in coloration with a white chin, and adult males have a blue scrotum. Preuss&#x27;s monkeys weigh up to 10 kg. Troops consist of one adult male and several females and adolescents, averaging 17 total per troop. Females give birth to a single offspring about once every three years. The young mature at 4 years and live to be an average of 31 years.

Preuss&#x27;s monkey is an endangered species, due to habitat loss and hunting. It is one of the species that live in the Guinean Forests of the West Africa Biodiversity Hotspot.

Preuss&#x27;s monkey is known to occur in captivity at the Centre for Education, Rehabilitation, and Conservation of Primates and Nature (CERCOPAN) in Cross River State, Nigeria and the Limbe Wildlife Centre in Limbe, South-West Region, Cameroon. 

There are two subspecies of Preuss&#x27;s monkey:
* Cameroon Preuss&#x27;s monkey, &quot;Cercopithecus preussi preussi&quot;
* Bioko Preuss&#x27;s monkey, &quot;Cercopithecus preussi insularis&quot;

<text>KBHT (1590 AM &quot;Kicker 99.3&quot;) is a commercial radio station, paired with an FM relay translator, broadcasting a classic country radio format. Licensed to Mexia, Texas, the station serves the Waco metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by M&amp;M Broadcasters, Ltd. Its studios are in Waco, and its transmitter is located in Mexia.

==Translator==
==History==
On May 23, 1956, the station signed on as KBUS. It was owned by Bi-Stone Broadcasting, and was a 500 watt daytimer, required to leave the air after sunset.

On February 29, 2012, the then-KLRK changed its format to adult hits, branded as &quot;101.3 Bob FM&quot;, also broadcasting on FM translator K267AI 101.3 FM in Moody, Texas.

On February 28, 2013, KLRK changed its format to Regional Mexican music, branded as &quot;La Caliente.&quot;

On April 18, 2014, KLRK changed back to dance hits, branded as &quot;101.3 Party&quot;.

On February 3, 2015, KLRK changed its format to adult contemporary music and rebranded as &quot;Mix 101.3&quot;.

On August 20, 2016, KLRK switched to a simulcast of adult contemporary-formatted KBHT 104.9 FM in Bellmead. 1590 switched again to adult hits, as &quot;Bob-FM&quot; simultaneously with 104.9 FM. Ironically, 1590 and 104.9 were reunited as a result, having once been independently programmed AM and FM sister stations, owned by the Groveton Family, and still broadcasting from Downtown Mexia.

During the summer of 2018, KLRK began airing the national Fox Sports Radio feed and reimaged as &quot;Fox Sports 1590.&quot;

The station changed its call sign to KEKR on November 28, 2019.

On January 19, 2020, KEKR changed its format from sports (which moved to KBHT-HD3) to classic country, branded as &quot;Kicker 99.3&quot;.

On July 2, 2023, KEKR began simulcasting its classic country format on KBHT 104.9 FM Bellmead/Waco and rebranded as &quot;Kicker 104.9&quot;.

On July 15, 2024, &quot;Kicker 104.9&quot; reverted to &quot;Kicker 99.3&quot;, remaining on this station and its translator, while 104.9 broke away from the simulcast to assume the format of 92.9 KRMX, after that facility was sold to new ownership.

<doc id="1134910" wikidata="Q2916012" url="?curid=1134910" title="Toilet roll holder">
<text>A toilet-roll holder, also known as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. Common models include a hinged length of wire mounted horizontally on a wall, a thicker axle either recessed into a wall or mounted on a frame, or a freestanding vertical pole on a base. In recent years, automatic toilet paper dispensers which automatically fold and cut the toilet paper are being installed in public toilets.

==Main holders==

A horizontal axle design is found in most homes, and also in many schools. It is easy to use due to its low friction and ease of refilling. This is the type of holder most commonly assumed about when toilet paper orientation is mentioned.

Whereas some have the roll mounted at a fixed distance from the surface on which it is mounted, others have an axle on a hinge or groove that allows it to move and maintain contact even as the roll shrinks from use. These designs provide additional friction to make it easier to tear off a piece of tissue. More sophisticated designs include a curved horizontal plate that covers the roll, thus removing the necessity of touching the roll, and a protruding horizontal bump that creates resistance to facilitate single-handedly pulling off slices of paper. These roll holders can be used in both under and over roll orientation, but may be difficult to use in the under orientation.

Originally intended to hold a stock of replacement rolls, the vertical pole has become the only paper holder in some households. It is particularly useful in homes where the family has mixed handedness. Its drawbacks include that there is a lot more friction than in other types of toilet roll holders, and thus not as easy to use.

==Automatic dispenser==
An automatic toilet paper dispenser can be either button or sensor-activated to fold and cut the toilet paper automatically. Automatic toilet paper dispensers can help aid disabled users, especially in large facilities. Examples are the Camitool by the Japanese company Shikoku, which uses motion sensors to dispense the toilet paper; the SCOTT by Kimberly-Clark, released in 2007, which is also motion activated, though also has a manual knob; and the OriFuji, introduced in 2015, which automatically cuts the toilet paper and folds it into a neat triangle shape.

== Public toilets ==
The holders in many public toilets are designed to make it difficult for patrons to steal the toilet rolls. Various contraptions have been devised to lock the spare rolls away, and release them only when the active roll is used up.

An increasing number of public toilets are furnished with holders that hold very large rolls of toilet paper. Others hold two large rolls with an access door that allows the user to switch between roll one and roll two when one roll is empty. These are designed to save money by reducing the frequency of janitorial services to restock the paper.

In many toilets, especially in elementary schools, a dispenser releases only a small square of toilet paper to prevent a user from intentionally clogging the toilet with large amounts of paper.

Coin-operated dispensers have also been developed.

==Orientation==


Some toilet roll holders or dispensers allow the toilet paper to hang in front of (over) or behind (under) the roll when it is placed parallel to the wall. This divides opinions about which orientation is better. Arguments range from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, ease of detaching sheets, and compatibility with pets. The US advice column Ask Ann Landers reported that the subject was the most controversial issue in the column&#x27;s history and, at 15,000 letters in 1986, provoked the highest number of responses. Some writers have proposed that preference for one orientation over the other may have connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status. 

The main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit. Some particular advantages cited for each orientation include: hanging over reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one&#x27;s knuckles, potentially transferring grime and germs; makes it easier to visually locate and to grasp the loose end; gives the option to fold over the last sheet to show that the room has been cleaned; and is generally the intended direction of viewing for the manufacturer&#x27;s branding, so patterned toilet paper looks better this way.

The under position provides a tidier appearance, in that the loose end can be more hidden from view; reduces the risk of a toddler or a house pet such as a cat unrolling the toilet paper when batting at the roll; and in a recreational vehicle may reduce unrolling during driving. Partisans have claimed that each method makes it easier to tear the toilet paper on a perforated sheet boundary. 

In various surveys, around 70% of people prefer the over position. In a survey of 1,000 Americans, Cottonelle found that &quot;overs&quot; are more likely than &quot;unders&quot; to notice a roll&#x27;s direction (74 percent), to be annoyed when the direction is incorrect (24 percent), and to have flipped the direction at a friend&#x27;s home (27 percent). According to &quot;W. C. Privy&#x27;s Original Bathroom Companion, Number 2&quot;, &quot;By more than 4 to 1, older folks prefer to have their toilet paper dispense over the front.&quot; The same claim is made by James Buckley&#x27;s &quot;The Bathroom Companion&quot; for people older than 50. Toilet paper orientation is sometimes mentioned as a hurdle for married couples. The issue may also arise in businesses and public places. At the Amundsen–Scott Research Station at the South Pole, complaints have been raised over which way to install toilet paper. It is unclear if one orientation is more economical than the other. The &quot;Centralian Advocate&quot; attributes a claim to Planet Green that &quot;over&quot; saves on paper usage.

Various toilet paper dispensers are available which avoid the question of over or under orientation; for example, single sheet dispensers, jumbo roll dispensers in which the toilet roll is perpendicular to the wall, and twin roll dispensers. Swivelling toilet paper dispensers have been developed which allow the paper to be unrolled in either direction.

<doc id="1134914" wikidata="Q321331" url="?curid=1134914" title="Novo Hamburgo">
<text>Novo Hamburgo (&#x27;New Hamburg&#x27;, ; ) is a municipality in the southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, located in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, the state capital. As of 2020, its population was 247,032. The city covers an area of , and the average temperature is , which is mild for the region. The Sinos River runs through the urban area.

Consolidated by German immigrants, the city was named after Hamburg, Germany. Novo Hamburgo&#x27;s population is still predominantly of German descent.

In the 1980s, Novo Hamburgo received the nickname of &quot;the national capital of shoes&quot;, attracting many athletes, tracks and companies connected to the sport. Nowadays, the city is the industrial centre of the Sinos River Valley, the economy of which is based mainly on the manufacture of shoes and the associated leather goods supply chain.

==History==

The area of the city was first settled by Portuguese immigrants in the mid 18th century, but it would grow to the status of village only with the arrival of the first German immigrants in 1824. At that time, Novo Hamburgo was part of São Leopoldo, the cradle of German immigration in Brazil. The Germans established a prosperous agricultural colony and eventually started to supply the state&#x27;s main urban centers at that time with food.

Some of the immigrants also brought handicraft skills, valuable for a self-sufficient, isolated economy, as the valley and the state were at that time. In Novo Hamburgo, the first urban agglomeration appeared around the Hamburger Berg, circa 1870, where there was a little commerce. The city was emancipated from São Leopoldo on 5 April 1927, and soon joined the rest of Brazil in its run to industrialization. The city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Hamburgo in 1980.

==Emancipation==

In the mid-1920s, Novo Hamburgo was a sub district of São Leopoldo. At this time, the shoe industry was in full swing and there was an intense expansion of trade and an abundance of work for the service providers in the region. In 1924 this expansion prompted a group of men to create a committee with the goal of achieving emancipation for the district. These men were: Jacob Kroeff Neto, Pedro Adams Filho, Leopodo Petry, André Klipp, Julius Kunz, José João Carlos Martins and Carlos Dienstbach.

On three occasions letters sent to the São Leopoldo council requesting emancipation were denied. Faced with this rejection the group decided to send the request to the state government. The governor at that time was Borges de Medeiros who subsequently asked the commission to submit a formal application including voter signatures requesting emancipation.

Three years later on the 5 April 1927, Borges de Medeiros signed decree number 3818, known as &quot;The order Gold&quot; creating the municipality Novo Hamburgo. On the same day decree number 3819 was signed creating an administration with a constitutional basis and allowing for the nomination of a temporary mayor. The document gave a maximum period of two months to hold an election for mayor and councillors.
Jacob Kroeff Netto was named the first Provisional Mayor of Novo Hamburgo by Borges, under decree number 3820.

==Geography==

===Hydrography===

Novo Hamburgo is part of the River Sinos basin. The city is divided into four basins, formed by Pampa creek, Cerquinho creek, Luiz Rau creek and Gauchinha creek. As well as these, there are several creeks that flow into the várzea region of the Sinos, both on the north bank of the river and in the south.

===Climate===

Novo Hamburgo has four well defined seasons. In winter, temperatures can hover around , and in some instances can reach . In the summer the temperatures get high, often above . The average temperature of Novo Hamburgo during the year is .

==Industry==
Novo Hamburgo is most famous for its footwear industry. The footwear manufacturing industry came about quite quickly, and led to Novo Hamburgo being recognized as the Capital of Brazilian Footwear. The city also has industries in the area of pharmacy, cosmetics, furniture, food, appliances, clothing, graphic art, electronics, chemical and constructions.

This industry also spread into neighboring towns, with many tanneries, chemical plants and shoe component factories being opened.
One example of this industry is the National Fair of Shoes held annually in Fenac. This fair was started locally in 1963 held in a small neighbourhood convention centre. Today, Fenac is not only home to this fair but also other related fairs such as Fimec (footwear machines exhibition), and Courovisão Ecovisão (Leather Fair).

A new Industrial District is being planned in the area of Lomba Grande, however some locals have voiced concerns that this construction may have environmental implications.

===Export===
It is estimated that about 80% of Brazilian exports of shoes come out of Rio Grande do Sul, with Novo Hamburgo being the center of these operations. Novo Hamburgo has developed a complete infrastructure for production, marketing and trading of footwear, and now has the largest movement of containers in Brazil. The export of shoes is currently worth about two billion dollars.

==Shops and services==

Novo Hamburgo is the largest commercial area of Sinos River Valley, with more than 5,500 outlets, including major Brazilian chain stores such as Magazine Luiza, Lojas Renner, C&amp;A, Lojas Americanas, Casas Bahia, Ponto Frio, Lojas Colombo and Delta Sul.

In the shopping district there are four large supermarkets (Wal-Mart, recently sold by the parent multinational and now under different ownership), Carrefour, Bourbon (Zaffari) and Hiper Rissul. There are two malls in this city: Bourbon Shopping Novo Hamburgo and i-Fashion Outlet.

Example of the service industry are cargo agents, brokers, export agents, trading companies as well as the presence of important banks.

==Theatre==

The Paschoal Charlemagne Theatre located at the Culture Department of Novo Hamburgo, has a capacity for approximately 490 people. Paranóia Productions has a school in the theatre trains local actors. The school has sent students to the biggest cities of the country to work inplays and shows.

 The Feevale University inaugurated on 20 September 2011 the largest theatre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul with a capacity to 1,805 spectators in Novo Hamburgo. The theatre was built in the campus II of the university. It is administered in partnership with Opus Promotions.

==Education==

The first school in Novo Hamburgo was founded in 1832, called Comunidade Evangélica Hamburgo Velho (Old Hamburg Evangelic Community). The school taught through the German language as that was the most common language at that time. The teaching material was poor and the provincial government was giving them little support. The central government at the time had no interest in investing in education and therefore would not release funds to the different provinces.

In 1833 there were only two public schools, in 1866 a school for girls was founded by a group of Nuns – The Engel Sisters located in the Hamburgo Velho neighborhood. which would become a &quot;Fundação Evangélica&quot; (Evangelic Foundation). The creation of this school was a big step for women&#x27;s education, although still largely focused on traditional values such as child rearing and home care.

The first Catholic school created in the town was Santa Catarina college founded on the 10 June 1900 by the Sisters Maria Romualda Flash and Maria Julitta Schwark, who were invited to come to the Hamburg Berg region (which would later become Hamburgo Velho) by several families – Czermak, Carlos Klein, José Kroeff, João Altmeyer, Zimmer and Plentz.

The Jesuit priests arrived in the Sinos River Valley region in the mid-nineteenth century and took over the Church Nossa Senhora da Piedade in Hamburgo Velho. In 1914, the Priest Benedict Meienhofer organized the opening of a Catholic school for boys, which was called St. Jacob&#x27;s college.

In 1927, the year when Novo Hamburgo was emancipated, there were seven state schools in the city, with a total of 374 students, one state school with 72 students and six private schools with 478 students. In 1930 there were eight state schools, six city run schools and eight private schools, with the student population rising to 1,477.

The Vargas Era (1930–1945) represented a significant advance in Brazilian education. This educational revolution also had an impact in Novo Hamburgo. In 1943, the city schools had grown to a total of 35, with a total of 3668 students.
The main educational institutions in Novo Hamburgo today are:

* Ceducs Centro de Educação Superior
* Colégio Marista Pio XII
* Colégio Santa Catarina
* Faculdade IENH — Instituição Evangélica do Novo Hamburgo
* Ftec Faculdades
* Fundação Escola Técnica Liberato Salzano V da Cunha
* Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul
* Universidade Feevale

==Tourism==
Novo Hamburgo is one of 13 cities on the Rota Romântica, a scenic corridor of Brazilian cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul with heavy Germanic influence. Other cities on the corridor are São Leopoldo, Estância Velha, Ivoti, Dois Irmãos, Morro Reuter, Santa Maria do Herval, Presidente Lucena, Picada Café, Nova Petrópolis, Gramado, Canela and São Francisco de Paula.

In the historical centre which is located in the Hamburgo Velho neighbourhood, there are still some half-timbered buildings constructed in the same technique, as the Community Schmitt-Presser Museum (first exemplary technique protected by IPHAN in Brazil).
There are also the works of the German architect Ernst Seubert, some of his known buildings are the Church of Reis Magos (IECLB), the Church of Our Lady of Mercy, Bakery Reiss (&quot;Padaria Reiss&quot;), Schmitt House (&quot;Casa Rosa&quot;) and Municipal Public Library Machado De Assis. Also noteworthy is the neoclassical building of the Ernesto Frederico Scheffel Foundation.

There is a &quot;historic-cultural street&quot; called Rua General Osório, along which there are dozens of historic buildings from various periods. Notable buildings along this street are the St. Catherine College, the building of the former Frohsin Society, designed by the German architect Theo Wiederspahn, the homes of the families Richter, Klein, Momberger, Snel, and Grunner, This street is recognized by the City Master Plan as an area of historical and cultural interest.

The downtown area has landmarks such as the Monument to the Shoemaker, Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis Gonzaga, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Ascension, both historical constructions of the 1950s. The latter follows the Gothic style, with pure forms of the original Gothic architecture. There are also dozens of eclectic houses distributed among this historical area, but these are not officially recognized. The city also presents some interesting examples of modernism, especially residences built in the period 1950–1960.

===Natural Attractions Lomba Grande===
It is the Rural District of Novo Hamburgo, occupied an area of 156 square kilometers, making a total of two thirds of the municipal area. It is considered environmentally protected area where the wetlands of the Sinos River is very important for the preservation of the ecosystem, both fauna as flora.

Lomba Grande also received the first German immigrants who settled in the Hemp Linen factory, then owned by the municipality of São Leopoldo.

There are restaurants offering food fresh from the colonial neighborhood itself. The neighborhood also has many cultural attractions such as churches, cemeteries and a roadmap that includes visits to artists.

==Economy and society==
The German craftsmen eventually started to manufacture shoes and machinery on a large scale and in the 1960s began to export goods, a process that transformed the city into a magnet for internal immigrants from impoverished areas around the state and the country. This caused significant demographic growth that was not accompanied by the infrastructure needed to accommodate the recently arrived population; favelas then formed.
Today&#x27;s Novo Hamburgo depends heavily upon shoe exports, although it diversified its industrial and commercial base in the early 1990s.
==Media==
===Newspapers===

In 1918 the first newspaper called the Monoclo was registered and circulated, the paper was directed by Arnaldo Mayer and distributed on Saturdays. This newspaper had a short life, lasting only nine issues. This was during the period in which Hamburguer Berg was still a district of São Leopoldo. There are reports that the Monoclo had an important role in the fight for emancipation of Novo Hamburgo city, despite having closed its activities before Novo Hamburgo was emancipated.

The &quot;5 Abril&quot; newspaper is considered the first newspaper published in the city of Novo Hamburgo. It was set up by Leopoldo Petry who decided to create the newspaper to defend the interests of the city. The &quot;5 Abril&quot; newspapers were published weekly in Portuguese, but with advertising in German. The newspaper lasted 35 years, completing 1811 editions. There were four pages per issue and 200 to 300 copies were distributed each week. These were significant numbers for the period, given that the German language was predominant among the 8,500 inhabitants. Over the next 30 to 50 years, there were several newspapers that began publishing in Novo Hamburgo such as:

* The Novo Hamburgo newspaper directed by Anthony Benfica Filho,
* The Intriga newspaper (1931).
* Pau na Nunca newspaper (1931);
* Gazeta Novo Hamburgo, led by Octavian Barreto de Borba (1934);
* Gazeta newspaper (1948);
* Evolucao newspaper (1953);
* Correio Gaucho (1955);
* Jornal NH (1960).

The development of &quot;gaúcho&quot; journalism generated opportunities for the creation of new newspapers in such as the Jornal SL in 1957 in São Leopoldo and Jornal NH, in 1960 in Novo Hamburgo. Today, with more than 250,000 inhabitants, Novo Hamburgo is the seventh most populated city in the state. Jornal NH is the largest newspaper in the region, one of the largest published in the state and the largest newspaper in Brazil outside a major metropolitan area, by number of subscribers. Jornal NH is part of Grupo Sinos, a conglomerate of regional newspapers, magazines, radio and digital content.

===Radio===

The first broadcast in Novo Hamburgo was Radio Hamburguense Progresso in 1948, directed by Milton Vergara Corrêa. The city currently has 4 radio stations, all in FM: ABC 103.3 FM, União FM 105.3, Alegria FM 92.9, 88.7 FM and Felicidade FM 90.3.

===Television===
The city has two local TV channels, both broadcast by cable by the Claro operator: Vale TV and TV Feevale. Vale TV is a community TV channel available in Novo Hamburgo and neighboring cities that airs programming produced locally in the city. TV Feevale is a TV channel belonging to Feevale University. It is a local affiliate of Futura that broadcasts primarily educational programming, in addition to local news.

==Sport==

Esporte Clube Novo Hamburgo is major football team in town. It is affectionately known as the &quot;Anilado&quot; among fans. The club disputes mainly the Campeonato Gaúcho, but it has competed regularly in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série D. The club was founded on 1 May 1911 by a group of employees of the extinct Adams shoe factory. Since then, the Hamburguenses could watch in the victories of team the Santa Rosa Stadium. The stadium was sold in 2005, and a new stadium was built in 2011, called Estádio do Vale. The team&#x27;s biggest achievement was to win the 2017 Campeonato Gaúcho, the first time since 2000 that a team that wasn&#x27;t Porto Alegre&#x27;s powerhouses Grêmio and Internacional won the championship.

In the city, it is also possible to practice or attend games and competitions in tennis, volleyball, punhobol, futsal, archery, handball, bicycle motocross, among other activities.

==Metro==
The history of the railways of Rio Grande do Sul date back to 1866 with proposals for construction in the Sinos River Valley region. On 14 April 1874, the first train track between Porto Alegre and São Leopoldo was completed. This was constructed by a British Company called &quot;The Porto Alegre &amp; New Hamburg Brazilian Railway Company Limited&quot;. Owned by Johan Mac Ginity.

The first train arrived in Novo Hamburgo on 1 January 1876. The station was named Novo Hamburgo Station. The railway did not go through the village of Hamburguer Berg, the station was built some 3 km away thus, a new urban area began to develop around the railway station. Only in 1882 the Novo Hamburgo station was connected at the village which was named as Hamburguer Berg, this line eventually was extended to Canela in 1922.

In 1919, the Novo Hamburgo station was renamed Borges de Medeiros, reflecting the anti-German sentiment caused by Great War and also Hamburg Berg was renamed Genuine Sampaio. However, Novo Hamburgo station returned to the original name in 1920 and Hamburguer Berg received its current name of Hamburgo Velho.

In 1964, the Novo Hamburgo to Taquara line was closed, leaving Novo Hamburgo station as the end point of the line. In late 1966, the rest of section, Rio dos Sinos to Novo Hamburgo stations was abolished and the station was deactivated.

In 2008 the Federal government authorized the expansion of Porto Alegre Metro train services to Novo Hamburgo. The works started in early 2009 and is expected to be completed 2013. This project includes the construction of an additional 9.3 kilometres and four new stations: Rio dos Sinos, in the municipality of São Leopoldo, Liberdade, Fenac and Novo Hamburgo, in the city of Novo Hamburgo.

<doc id="1134919" wikidata="Q83767" url="?curid=1134919" title="The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)">
<text>The Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American coming-of-age romantic survival drama film directed by Randal Kleiser from a screenplay written by Douglas Day Stewart based on the 1908 novel of the same name by Henry De Vere Stacpoole. The film stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The music score was composed by Basil Poledouris, and the cinematography was by Néstor Almendros.

The film tells the story of two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. But without either the guidance or the restrictions of society, emotional and physical changes arise as they reach puberty, go skinny dipping in the ocean, fall in love, and end up having a child.

&quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; was theatrically released on June 20, 1980, by Columbia Pictures. The film was panned by critics, who disparaged its screenplay, execution, and Shields&#x27; performance, but Almendros&#x27; cinematography received praise. In spite of the criticism, the film was a commercial success, grossing $58.8 million on a $4.5 million budget and becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1980 in North America. The film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Almendros, and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor for Atkins. Shields won the inaugural Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her work in the film.

== Plot ==

In the late Victorian period, two cousins, nine-year-old Richard and seven-year-old Emmeline Lestrange, and galley cook Paddy Button, are shipwrecked on a lush tropical island in the South Pacific. Paddy cares for the children and forbids them &quot;by law&quot; from going to the other side of the island, where he finds an altar with bloody remains from human sacrifices. He also warns them against eating any deadly scarlet berries. He dies after a drunken binge, and the children rebuild their home on a different part of the island.

Having reached puberty, the two go skinny dipping in the ocean, but Emmeline is uncomfortable with her sexual attraction to Richard and declines to share her &quot;funny&quot; thoughts with him. She is frightened by her first menstrual period and refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a wound.

Eventually, Richard recognizes his attraction to Emmeline. She ventures to the forbidden side of the island and sees the altar. Associating the blood with Christ&#x27;s crucifixion, she concludes that the altar is God and tries to persuade Richard to go to the other side of the island to pray with her. Richard is shocked at the idea of breaking the law and they argue. When Richard tries to initiate sexual contact with Emmeline, she rebuffs him. He hides from her and masturbates.

When a ship appears for the first time in years, Emmeline does not light the signal fire and the ship passes by without noticing them. When Richard confronts Emmeline about her failure, she asserts to his angry disbelief that the island is now their home and that they should remain there. Emmeline also reveals that she knows about Richard&#x27;s masturbation and threatens to tell her Uncle Arthur about this. They fight and she throws a coconut at him, hitting him in the head by chance. Richard angrily slaps her and kicks her out of their shelter.

Emmeline steps on a venomous stonefish. Weak from the poison, she pleads with Richard to &quot;take [her] to God&quot;. Richard carries her across the island and places her on the altar. Emmeline recovers and they swim naked in the lagoon. Noticing their bodies&#x27; reactions, they discover sexual intercourse and become lovers. Neither recognizes what is happening when Emmeline becomes pregnant, and they are stunned to feel the baby move inside her abdomen, assuming her stomach is causing the movements.

Months later, Richard observes indigenous people performing a human sacrifice in front of the statue. He becomes frightened and runs away to find Emmeline, whom he finds in labor. Emmeline gives birth to a baby boy, whom they name Paddy.

A ship led by Richard&#x27;s father, Arthur, approaches the island and sees the family playing on the shore. Content with their lives, Richard and Emmeline walk away instead of signaling for help. Arthur assumes the mud-covered couple are not Richard and Emmeline.

Visiting their original homesite, Richard searches for bananas while Paddy, unnoticed, brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat with Emmeline. Paddy tosses an oar out of the boat as it drifts from the shore. Richard swims after them followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard time to get into the boat. The boat drifts oarless out to sea.

After drifting for days, Richard and Emmeline wake up to find Paddy eating the scarlet berries. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, and lie down to await death. Some hours later, Arthur&#x27;s ship finds them. Arthur asks, &quot;Are they dead?&quot; The officer assures him, &quot;No, sir. They&#x27;re asleep.&quot;

== Production ==

The film was a passion project of Randal Kleiser, who had long admired the original novel. He hired Douglas Day Stewart, who had written &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; (1976), to write the script and met up with Richard Franklin, the Australian director, who was looking for work in Hollywood. This gave him the idea to use an Australian crew, which Franklin helped supervise.

===Casting===
Brooke Shields was cast as Emmeline Lestrange based on her performance in &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1978). Jodie Foster auditioned for the role of Emmeline Lestrange, but she was turned down. Kelly Preston also auditioned for the role. Diane Lane was offered the role but turned it down. Willie Aames was considered for the role of Richard Lestrange.

===Filming===

Principal photography of this film began on June 18, 1979 and it was shot at Nanuya Levu, a privately owned island in Fiji. The flora and fauna featured in the film includes an array of animals from multiple continents, including a species of iguana then unknown to Nanuya Levu. Herpetologist John Gibbons had just discovered said iguana on nearby Yadua Tabu, but word from an associate who had watched the film and spotted a strange lizard confirmed the existence of a second population. With credit to &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;, Gibbons described the Fiji crested iguana (&quot;Brachylophus vitiensis&quot;) in 1981.

Shields was 14 years of age when she appeared in the film. All of her nude scenes were performed by the film&#x27;s 32-year-old stunt coordinator, Kathy Troutt. Shields did many of her topless scenes with her hair glued to her breasts. Atkins was 18 when the movie was filmed, and he performed his own nude scenes (which included brief frontal nudity).

Underwater moving picture photography was performed by Ron Taylor and Valerie Taylor.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 12% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A piece of lovely dreck, &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; is a naughty fantasy that&#x27;s also too chaste to be truly entertaining&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Among the more common criticisms were the ludicrously idyllic portrayal of how children would develop outside of civilized society, the unfulfilled buildup of the island&#x27;s natives as a climactic threat and how the film, while teasing a prurient appeal, conspicuously obscures all sexual activities. Roger Ebert gave the film 1½ stars out of 4, claiming that it &quot;could conceivably have been made interesting, if any serious attempt had been made to explore what might really happen if two 7-year-old kids were shipwrecked on an island. But this isn&#x27;t a realistic movie. It&#x27;s a wildly idealized romance, in which the kids live in a hut that looks like a Club Med honeymoon cottage, while restless natives commit human sacrifice on the other side of the island&quot;. He also deemed the ending a blatant cop-out. He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their &quot;dogs of the year&quot; in a 1980 episode of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; commented that the film &quot;was hyped as being about &#x27;natural love&#x27;; but apart from &#x27;doing it in the open air&#x27;, there is nothing natural about two kids (unfettered by the bonds of society from their early years) subscribing to marriage and traditional role-playing&quot;.

Judith Martin of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;For some 40 minutes, it&#x27;s a charming and beautiful film&quot;, but criticized the script when the children mature into teens, particularly &quot;the dialogue, with its silly double entendres, insisting on a relentlessly filthy chuckle to accompany the children&#x27;s discovery of each other.&quot; Gary Arnold, also of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, similarly called the film &quot;a picturesque rhapsody to Learning Skills, Playing House, Going Swimming, Enjoying the Scenery and Starting to Feel Sexy in tropical seclusion&quot;. He particularly ridiculed the lead characters&#x27; persistent inability to make obvious inferences. One of the few positive reviews came from &quot;Variety&quot; which claimed it &quot;a beautifully mounted production&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the film is &quot;more serene&quot; than Kleiser’s previous effort &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;but it also has a nonsensical glaze that contributes to the inadvertent merriment&quot; and &quot;it tends to be enjoyably silly&quot;. She concluded, &quot;Nestor Almendros&#x27;s cinematography is soothingly gorgeous, and so are Miss Shields and Mr. Atkins. Both are quite adequate to the movie&#x27;s requirements, and neither has much acting to do--Miss Shields&#x27;s hardest job, for instance, is to pretend she is giving birth to a baby without ever having wondered why she&#x27;s put on so much weight. Her second hardest job is to keep the wind from ruffling her hair.&quot;

In a retrospective review for RogerEbert.com, critic Abbey Bender wrote: &quot;When it comes to the depiction of burgeoning sexuality, ″&quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;″ wants to have it both ways ... with puberty making itself known through rather obvious dialogue. Sexual discovery is here the natural outcome of the storybook situation. So yes, the soft-focus montages of teen flesh are gratuitous but the film presents it all as innocent—these kids don&#x27;t even know what sex is! They don&#x27;t even know how a baby is made! They learn it the hard way, obviously. By couching sexuality in primitive purity, ″&quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;″ gets away with perversion that would likely be even more controversial today&quot;.

=== Box office ===
The film was the twelfth-biggest box office hit of 1980 in North America according to &quot;The Numbers&quot;, grossing US$58,853,106 in the United States and Canada on a $4.5 million budget.

=== Accolades ===
== Versions and adaptations ==
&quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; was based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole&#x27;s novel of the same name, which first appeared in 1908. The first film adaptation of the book was the British silent 1923 film of that name, which is now lost. There was another British adaptation in 1949.

The sequel &quot;Return to the Blue Lagoon&quot; (1991) picks up where &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; left off, except with confirmation that Richard and Emmeline are dead when found in the boat. Their son is rescued.

A television adaptation of the novel by TV network Lifetime, &quot;Blue Lagoon: The Awakening&quot;, was released in 2012.

The Indian film &quot;Ina&quot; (1982), directed by I. V. Sasi, is inspired by &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; and &quot;The Emerald Forest&quot; (1985). The story is set in the Indian state of Kerala and explores teen lust, child marriage and the consequences. The Indian film &quot;Teri Baahon Mein&quot; (1984) and the Hindi film &quot;Jaan Ki Kasam&quot; (1991) are also inspired by it.

== Home media ==
The Special Edition DVD, with both widescreen and fullscreen versions, was released on October 5, 1999. Its special features include the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette called &quot;An Adventure in Filmmaking: The Making of The Blue Lagoon&quot;, a personal photo album by Brooke Shields, audio commentary by Randal Kleiser and Christopher Atkins, and another commentary by Kleiser, Shields, and Douglas Day Stewart. The film was re-released in 2005 as part of a two-pack with its sequel, &quot;Return to the Blue Lagoon&quot;.

A limited-edition Blu-ray disc of the film was released on December 11, 2012, by Twilight Time. The Blu-ray includes an isolated score track and three original teasers, in addition to the special features ported from the 1999 DVD release.

The 1980 movie was made available for streaming through services such as Amazon Video and Vudu.

<doc id="1134955" wikidata="Q3837498" url="?curid=1134955" title="Wrestling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's Greco-Roman 84 kg">
<text>The men&#x27;s Greco-Roman 84 kilograms at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as part of the wrestling program were held at the Ano Liosia Olympic Hall, from August 24 to August 25.

The competition was held with an elimination system of three or four wrestlers in each pool, with the winners qualifying for the quarterfinals, semifinals, and final by way of direct elimination.

Pelle Svensson, a former two-time world champion (Greco-Roman 100 kg class) and member of the board of FILA from 1990 to 2007, has described FILA as an inherently corrupt organization. During the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Svensson served as chairman of the disciplinary committee of FILA. As he was watching the final in the men&#x27;s Greco-Roman wrestling 84 kg class between Aleksey Mishin from Russia and Ara Abrahamian from Sweden, Svensson witnessed how the Russian team leader Mikhail Mamiashvili was giving signs to the referee. When Svensson approached him and informed him that this was not allowed according to the rules, Mamiashvili responded by saying: &quot;you should know that this may lead to your death&quot;. Svensson later found proof that the Romanian referee was bribed (according to Svensson the referee had received over one million Swedish krona).

<text>Mercyhurst University is a private Catholic university in Erie, Pennsylvania, United States.

== History ==
On September 20, 1926, Mercyhurst College opened its doors just a few blocks away from the city&#x27;s southern boundary. It was founded by the Sisters of Mercy of the Diocese of Erie, who were led by Borgia Egan, who became the first president of Mercyhurst College. The college received its charter on October 5, 1928.

In 1963, the college prep department separated to form Mercyhurst Preparatory School, which is located behind the university. On February 3, 1969, the board of trustees voted to make Mercyhurst a coed college. From its foundation in 1926 until 1972, members of the Sisters of Mercy had been presidents of the college. After 1972, lay presidents led the college. On March 27, 1991, Mercyhurst purchased the 100-year-old Redemptorist Seminary in North East and turned it into a branch campus, offering associate degrees and one-year certificates.

Among its five campuses, enrollment has grown to over 4,000 students instructed by 168 faculty. The endowment has increased to more than $20 million and its budget is more than $85 million.

The Mary D&#x27;Angelo Performing Arts Center opened in February 1996. Then, in fall 2002, the $7.5 million Audrey Hirt Academic Center opened on the southeast edge of campus, a building funded largely through the college&#x27;s $22.8 million capital campaign.

In August 2005, the $5 million Michele and Tom Ridge Health and Safety Building was dedicated at Mercyhurst North East. A $1.3 million residential apartment complex also opened in time for the North East campus&#x27; academic year.

Also in 2005, the board of trustees authorized the purchase of in Girard as the first step towards developing Mercyhurst West, a two-year college serving western Erie County, northwestern Crawford County and northeastern Ohio. The board of trustees elected Dr. Thomas J. Gamble as the 11th president of Mercyhurst College. Dr. Gamble, who previously served as vice president of academic affairs at the college, assumed the presidency March 1, 2006.

The construction of a $14 million freshman residence hall began in fall 2008, and the hall opened in the fall of 2009. Frances Warde Hall, a building, houses 318 students.

Opened in September 2012 is the Center for Academic Engagement, a four-story, building that will be set into the rolling hill north of Hammermill Library and feature a skywalk over East Main Drive to connect the two facilities. The building, which boasts many green technologies, houses classrooms and lab space for two of Mercyhurst&#x27;s signature programs—Intelligence Studies and Hospitality Management—as well as the Evelyn Lincoln Institute for Ethics and Society and the Mercyhurst Center for Applied Politics (MCAP). On January 25, 2012, Mercyhurst College officially became Mercyhurst University.

The Board of Trustees of Mercyhurst University appointed Michael T. Victor as the 12th president of Mercyhurst University on May 19, 2015. Victor had served as president of Lake Erie College since 2006. Victor served as dean of the Walker School of Business at Mercyhurst from 2002 to 2006. He took office on August 3, 2015.

On August 16, 2018, Mercyhurst University opened a $25 million residence hall. Ryan Hall houses more than 350 student suites. It also includes a dining hall, lounge area, convenience store, and a 150-seat banquet hall.

===Sexual assault allegations===
On October 10, 2004, the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; published a story stating that former president William Garvey molested grade school boys while serving as a basketball coach at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Erie. The article further stated that &quot;two current Erie residents told the Erie Times-News that Garvey paid them to have sex with him in the early to mid-1980s, when both men were minors.&quot; On December 17 the paper reported that Garvey &quot;abruptly announced his retirement Thursday, months before the completion of a college-ordered investigation Garvey had predicted would exonerate him.&quot; 

Several months after Garvey retired, an investigation conducted by retired Erie County Judge Michael Palmisano, at the instruction of the board of trustees, determined that the allegations against Garvey &quot;appear[ed] to have merit&quot;. The campus&#x27; central park was once named &quot;Garvey Park&quot; in honor of Garvey, but following the allegations was renamed to &quot;Trinity Green&quot;.

==Campus==
The university formerly had a branch campus located away in North East, Pennsylvania at the site of the former St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary. It offered associates degrees, but was closed at the end of the 2020-2021 academic year.

The university has also operated Mercyhurst Corry, a school offering an associate degree in business administration, for over 25 years.

The university&#x27;s fifth campus, Mercyhurst West, was located in Girard, Pennsylvania, at the site of the former Faith Lutheran Church. Classes began at this location in fall 2006. Due to low enrollment, the campus closed at the end of the 2013–2014 school year.

==Academics==
Enrollment at Mercyhurst University&#x27;s Erie campus is nearly 4,500 students. The university formerly was on a trimester calendar and moved to a 4–1–4 calendar for the 2013–2014 school year. Currently, the university is on a traditional semester calendar. It has more than 57 undergraduate degrees and almost 25 percent of the student body chooses to study abroad. Undergraduate students at Mercyhurst all complete the REACH curriculum, which stands for Reason and Faith, Expression and Creativity, Analytical Thought, Contexts and Systems, and Humans in Connection.

The university is organized into four colleges:
* The Hafenmaier College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences
* The Walker College of Business
* The Zurn College of Natural and Health Sciences
* The Ridge College of Intelligence Studies &amp; Applied Sciences

<doc id="1134964" wikidata="Q6531292" url="?curid=1134964" title="Lesnes Abbey">
<text>Lesnes Abbey is a former abbey, now ruined, in Abbey Wood, in the London Borough of Bexley, southeast London, England. It is a scheduled monument, and the abbey&#x27;s ruins are listed at Grade II by Historic England.

The adjacent Lesnes Abbey Woods are a Local Nature Reserve. Part of the wood is the Abbey Wood SSSI, a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest which is an important site for early Tertiary fossils.

==History==
After the Norman Conquest in 1066, the area of Lesnes, close to the town of Erith, passed into the possession of Bishop Odo, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Loisnes&quot; in the Hundred of &quot;Litlelai&quot;. The year 1178 saw the foundation of the Abbey of St Mary and St Thomas the Martyr at Lesnes, on a site now located in the suburbs of southeast London to the north of the ancient but long-managed Lesnes Abbey Woods that are named after it, where the land rises above what would originally have been marshland. It was the home for a small group of canons regular related to the Arroussian Order, a more relaxed version of the Augustinian canons, and subject to many reports over the years of religious, moral and administrative irregularities. 

Lesnes Abbey, as it is now known, was founded by Richard de Luci, Chief Justiciar of England, in 1178. This may have been in penance for his role in the protracted conflict between Henry II and Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, which culminated in the latter&#x27;s murder in 1170 by four of the king&#x27;s knights. In 1179, de Luci resigned his office and retired to the abbey, where he died three months later. He was buried in the chapter house on 14 July 1179. Produced for the Abbey between 1200 and 1220 in Oxford and Kent and now in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in South Kensington, London, the &#x27;Lesnes Missal&#x27; was possibly commissioned by him or a family member as it features references to the de Luci coat of arms.

In 1381 Abel Ker of Erith led a local uprising during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt, a rebellion which initially broke out in the neighbouring county of Essex. A group from Erith forced their way into nearby Lesnes Abbey and made the abbot (an important local landlord) to swear an oath to support them. They subsequently marched to Maidstone to join the main body of men led by Wat Tyler. Abbots also took a leading part in draining the marshland, but this and the cost of maintaining river embankments led to the Abbey suffering chronic financial difficulties. 

The Abbey never became a large community and was closed by Cardinal Wolsey in 1525, under a licence to suppress monasteries of less than seven inmates. The canonry buildings were all demolished except for the Abbott&#x27;s Lodging. Henry Cooke acquired the site in 1541 and it eventually passed to Sir John Hippersley who salvaged building materials, before selling the property to Thomas Hawes of London in 1632. It was then bequeathed to Christ&#x27;s Hospital in 1633. Some of the stone is said to have been used in the construction of Hall Place in nearby Bexley.

The abbey was effectively lost and the area became farmland, with the abbot&#x27;s house forming part of a farmhouse. In the late 18th or early 19th century a mulberry tree (&quot;Morus nigra&quot;) was planted on what had been the Abbey&#x27;s north side - this still stands and is now externally propped.

The site was excavated by Woolwich &amp; District Antiquarian Society in about 1909 to 1910. Archaeological finds from the Abbey&#x27;s site are held by the Royal Greenwich Heritage Trust, with some on display in Erith Library. The former London County Council purchased the site of the ruins in 1930, which were opened to the public as a park in 1931. Since 1986, the site has been the property of the London Borough of Bexley. A branch of the Green Chain Walk passes the ruins on its way from Oxleas Wood to Thamesmead riverside. In modern times the site has been restored to show some of the walls and the entire outline of the abbey is visible giving a good idea of the size and atmosphere of the original place. The ruins remain surrounded by parkland and an ornamental garden. There are also a café, a small exhibition of the abbey and toilet facilities for visitors.

==Lesnes Abbey ward==

Lesnes Abbey gives its name to one of the London Borough of Bexley&#x27;s 21 electoral wards. The ruins themselves are in the north of Lesnes Abbey ward. Woolwich Road, the A206 road, cuts through the middle of the ward spanning east to west; the A2041 road spans north to south marking the ward&#x27;s western boundary. West Heath is located within the ward to the south of Woolwich road. Lesnes Abbey ward is long north to south at its longest point, and little under at its widest point east to east. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 11,346.

<text>Synaptics, Inc. is an American neural network technologies and computer-to-human interface devices development company based in San Jose, California. It develops touchpads and fingerprint biometrics technology for computer laptops; touch, display driver, and fingerprint biometrics technology for smartphones; and touch, video and far-field voice, low-power AI processors, and wireless technology for smart home devices, wearables, and automobiles. Synaptics sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and display manufacturers.

Synaptics invented the computer touchpad, the click wheel on the classic iPod, Android phones&#x27; touch sensors, touch and display driver integrated chips (TDDI), and fingerprint sensors. Its technology is used in devices such as PCs, wearables, drones, gaming systems, media systems, cars, industrial security and monitoring equipment, and virtual reality headsets.

== History ==
===19861998: Initial years===
Federico Faggin and Carver Mead founded Synaptics in 1986. They used their research on neural networks and transistors on chips to build pattern recognition products such as the &quot;Silicon Retina&quot;, a circuit board emulating the human retina&#x27;s visual processing. In 1991, Synaptics patented a refined &quot;winner take all&quot; circuit for teaching neural networks how to recognize patterns and images. The circuit uses basic physics principles in order to select the strongest signal from the different processors.

In 1992, the company used the pattern recognition techniques it developed to build the world&#x27;s first touchpad for laptop computers that allowed users to control the cursor and click with no additional mechanical buttons. The pad was a replacement for trackballs and mice used at the time. By 1994, Twinhead and Epson America had adopted Synaptics&#x27; touchpad for their computers (Epson with the ActionNote), followed by Apple in 1995 and later by other computer manufacturers, including Compaq and Dell.

===19992010: Initial public offering and growth===
In 1999, Francis Lee took over as CEO. A year later, in 2000, Synaptics started selling touch technology for digital media players.

In 2002, Synaptics had an initial public offering. As adoption of the touchpad grew, Synaptics sought to integrate the technology with other products. In 2004, Apple debuted the iPod Mini and fourth-generation iPod, both featuring a scrolling click wheel that used Synaptics&#x27; capacitive touch technology. Synaptics also provided a similar but vertical click wheel for the Creative Zen Touch portable media player.

In 2005, Synaptics sensors were featured in the Samsung B310, the first mobile phone to use capacitive-touch technology. In October 2006, Synaptics provided a live demonstration of the Onyx, a concept smartphone with a color touchscreen enabled by its ClearPad touch controller technology. The Onyx&#x27;s touch sensor could tell the difference between a finger and a cheek, preventing accidental inputs during calls. The company&#x27;s touch technology was used in LG&#x27;s Prada phone in 2007, which was the world&#x27;s first mobile phone with a capacitive touchscreen. 

In 2008, touch sensors developed by Synaptics were used in T-Mobile&#x27;s G1 phone, one of the first Android phones. In the same year, Federico Faggin retired from the board of directors of Synaptics.

In 2009, Synaptics announced the development of the Fuse concept smartphone. It had touch sensitivity on the back of the phone, the ability to interact with the phone by squeezing, animated icons, a user interface sensitive to the phone&#x27;s orientation and tilt, and haptic gestures.

===20112019: Expansion, acquisitions, and further growth===
In 2011, Synaptics appointed Rick Bergman to succeed Francis Lee as CEO.

In 2012, Synaptics introduced the first pressure recognizing touchscreen, which allowed multi-finger and variable-force input. 

In late 2013, Synaptics acquired Validity Sensors, a fingerprint sensor vendor, adding fingerprint sensing technology to the company. In the same year, Synaptics relocated its headquarters to San Jose from Santa Clara. Six months after the move, Synaptics expanded its campus, purchasing nearby property for $10 million.

Synaptics is a founding member of the FIDO (Fast ID Online) Alliance and the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI).

Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers Inc., a Japanese company specializing in chips that manage LCD displays, in 2014. The acquisition enabled Synaptics to combine touch and display driver technologies into a single &quot;TDDI&quot; (Touch and Display Driver Integration) chip.

In 2015, the company expanded into additional markets, including automotive, wearables and PC peripherals. In July 2015, Synaptics announced a unique “match-in-sensor” fingerprint authenticator for laptops and other devices that authenticates the fingerprint within the chip.

The company introduced its first optical-based fingerprint sensor in December 2016, which would allow the sensor to be placed under smartphones&#x27; glass displays rather than under a separate button. After improving the technology, the company sent it into full production a year later. In January 2018, the Chinese company Vivo announced a smartphone featuring Synaptics&#x27; optical fingerprint sensor. This was the world’s first full-production smartphone with fingerprint authentication directly in the OLED display. 

In July 2017, Synaptics acquired Conexant Systems, an Amazon Alexa partner that creates voice and audio software and silicon products for smart homes. At the same time, Synaptics acquired Marvell Technology Group&#x27;s Multimedia Solutions unit, which creates video and audio processing technology. The two acquisitions were intended to aid Synaptics&#x27; expansion into the Internet of things (IoT) market.

In August 2019, the board of directors appointed Michael Hurlston as the new CEO. Under Hurlston&#x27;s leadership the company focused on growing its IoT business, expanding from its focus on sensors on glass towards development of low-power sensors to IoT devices.

===2020–present: Acquisitions, investments in IoT and AI technology===
In July 2020, Synaptics acquired DisplayLink, the developer of software and semiconductors that connect visual devices to computers.

In December 2020, Synaptics and Eta Compute established a co-development partnership, with Synaptics investing in Eta&#x27;s Series C funding. The partnership allows Synaptics to use Eta&#x27;s Tensai Flow software, including its AI applications and neural network tools, while Eta gains access to Synaptics&#x27; ultra-low-power Katana Edge AI SoC.

In July 2020, Synaptics acquired Broadcom&#x27;s wireless IoT business assets and manufacturing rights. In December 2021, the company acquired DSP Group for $538 million, integrating voice and vision artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into its portfolio and strengthening its wireless offerings with ultra-low-energy (ULE) enabled security applications

In February 2022, Synaptics sold its headquarters and North San Jose campus for $58 million.

In October 2022, Synaptics acquired Emza Visual Sense, an Israel-based company specializing in ultra-low-power AI for visual sensing.

In 2024, Synaptics introduced a platform based on its neural network processing technology for developers of Edge AI products. It provides hardware and software resources intended to support the creation of custom applications.

== Technology ==
Synaptics was founded as an AI-focused company to develop chips that utilize neural networks to mimic human brain functions.

In 1989, Synaptics received a patent for neural network-related circuitry designed to associate new events with previously learned ones.

In 1991, Synaptics researchers patented an enhancement of the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; circuit, originally developed by John Lazzaro at the University of Colorado. The circuit functions as a selector within a network of processors or neurons, identifying and amplifying the strongest signal based on fundamental physics principles. The patent introduced a method for dynamic recalibration of neurons, where the system self-tests against a reference pattern, adjusting biases by strengthening weaker signals and reducing overly sensitive ones. This allows for nearly instantaneous recalibrations, enabling continuous accuracy adjustments.

Synaptics also holds over 2000 patents for human technologies. Many Synaptics products are based on capacitive sensing technology, sensing the electrical properties of the finger(s) touching the sensor, as opposed to a resistive touchscreen . Synaptics also has optical sensing technology.

== Products and services ==

Synaptics originally focused on developing touch technology products and later expanded into IoT technology. In 1992, Synaptics introduced a chip designed to read magnetic characters on checks, notable for its higher accuracy and speed in handling poorly printed text compared to conventional technologies. The chip produced by Synaptics I-1000 was used in the Gemstone Onyx check reader of Verifone.

In the automotive industry, Synaptics has developed technology that enables drivers to adjust heating controls on touch screens while wearing thick gloves in freezing temperatures. In September 2018, the company began testing fingerprint technology in cars. This biometric system allows vehicle owners to personalize settings such as music preferences, seat adjustments, navigation options, and temperature settings based on fingerprint recognition. It also enables parents to implement geofencing limits to control where and how far teenage drivers can travel.

As of 2024, Synaptics develops and markets products for connectivity, sensing, and processing, as well as touch and display drivers, focused on the IoT market. In addition to developing developing enterprise workspace technology such as docking stations. Synaptics&#x27; technology is used in devices including PCs, wearables, drones, gaming systems, media systems, cars, industrial security and monitoring equipment, and virtual reality headsets.
Its connectivity products include wireless connectivity, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth products, and technology such as its wireless device communications protocol, Matter, which enables devices to operate together regardless of their different wireless interfaces. Synaptics acquired DisplayLink in 2020, adding that company&#x27;s hardware technology for docking stations and video conferencing, and software for graphics connectivity to its products. It also develops wired connection products such as converters for USB Type-C to HDMI or DisplayPort, for high resolution video display. 

Synaptics continues to develop laptop computer touchpads and fingerprint biometric technology, and other types of touch sensors and display drivers. It has also developed sensors for multiple parameters, including temperature, magnetic, capacitive, and inductive sensors that can be integrated into devices such as video game controllers, wearable devices such as earbuds. In 2016, Synaptics developed the FS9100, a fingerprint sensor that can function accurately beneath up to one millimeter of glass, making it easier to integrate under a device&#x27;s display.

Synaptics is also the developer of IronVeil, a technology that allows peripheral manufacturers to incorporate fingerprint recognition into devices such as mice, keyboards, and other peripherals compatible with Windows 10. IronVeil is a small embedded sensor measuring 0.15 by 0.39 inches, designed to authenticate users within 180 milliseconds.

Synaptics develops a variety of types of chips, including low-power edge AI processors and system-on-chip (SoC) technology for devices, such as smart home wireless devices, headsets, and for graphics connectivity for video displays. It develops and markets sound processing chips for voice recognition, used in voice controlled devices, including far-field voice DSPs.

In addition to its processors, it also develops display driver IC chips for technology such as VR headsets.

<doc id="1134974" wikidata="Q5508650" url="?curid=1134974" title="Fun Dip">
<text>Fun Dip is a candy manufactured by the Ferrara Candy Company. The candy has been on the market in the United States and Canada since the 1940s and was originally called Lik-M-Aid. It was originally manufactured by Fruzola, and then Sunline Inc., through their Sunmark Brands division. It was purchased by Nestlé in January 1989. Fun Dip was sold to Ferrero in 2018 along with other Wonka Candy Brands. It comes in many different flavors with candy sticks that are included.

Fun Dip is similar to another Wonka product Pixy Stix, but sold in small pouches, rather than paper or plastic straws. When called Lik-M-Aid, it consisted of 4 packets of flavored and colored sugar. When rebranded in the 1970s as Fun Dip, two edible candy sticks called &quot;Lik-A-Stix&quot; were added. While the original flavors consisted of lime, cherry and grape, the most common flavors are cherry, grape, and a raspberry/apple combination that turns from blue when dry to green when wet with saliva or water. It also comes in sour flavors, including sour watermelon, sour apple, and sour lemonade, as well as Tropical flavors, including watermelon sandía, mango, and strawberry fresa. There is also orange flavored Fun Dip. Since 2012, there has been an Easter edition known as Springtime Fun Dip, which includes the flavors of watermelon and strawberry. Packets with one stick and two flavors were once the standard, and packets with only one or two flavors are still available with less prominence than the now-standard three-flavor package.

<doc id="1134975" wikidata="Q1778607" url="?curid=1134975" title="Matrix management">
<text>Matrix management is an organizational structure in which some individuals report to more than one supervisor or leader—relationships described as solid line or dotted line reporting, also understood in context of vertical, horizontal &amp; diagonal communication in organisation for keeping the best output of product or services. More broadly, it may also describe the management of cross-functional, cross-business groups and other work models that do not maintain strict vertical business units or silos grouped by function and geography.

Matrix management, developed in U.S. aerospace in the 1950s, achieved wider adoption in the 1970s.

==Overview==
There are different types of matrix management, including &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;weak&quot;, and &quot;balanced&quot;, and there are hybrids between functional grouping and divisional or product structuring.
For example, by having staff in an engineering group who have marketing skills and who report to
both the engineering and the marketing hierarchy, an engineering-oriented company
produced &quot;many ground-breaking computer systems.&quot; This is an example of &quot;cross-functional&quot; matrix management, and is not the same as when, in the 1980s, a department acquired PCs and hired programmers.

Often senior employees, these employees are part of a product-oriented project manager&#x27;s team but also report to another boss in a functional department. A senior employee who may have worked previously for an advertising agency, designing ads for computers, may now be part of a marketing department at a computer company, but be working with an engineering group. This is often called cross-functional matrix management.

Companies that have multiple business units and international operations, upon closer inspection may apply matrix structures in different ways.

Even function-based organizations may apply this arrangement for limited projects.

==In practice==
Examples of using matrix management:
* Digital Equipment Corporation founder Ken Olsen spawned and popularized Matrix Management.
* ABB, formed from a 1988 merger and followed by &quot;an ambitious acquisition program.&quot; Guiding this was a corporate structure whereby &quot;local operations were organized within the framework of a two-dimensional matrix.&quot;

As for why the term is not publicly and formally affiliated with large numbers of corporations, a 2007 book about how &quot;matrix management made a big splash in the 1970s&quot; said that, &quot;for the most part... companies using matrix structures tend to keep quiet about it.&quot;

===Scaling back=== 
Two decades after pioneering in matrix management, Digital Equipment Corporation backed out, citing it as a source of &quot;sapped energy and efficiency from product-development efforts.&quot;

Regarding earlier years, when it worked, &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised &quot;consensus building that may have once helped Digital become the nation&#x27;s second-largest computer maker&quot; (after IBM). The same article noted the cutting of 20,000 jobs, and that what worked with the PC market didn&#x27;t work as well with larger systems, such as DEC Alpha.

This does not take away from what, a week earlier, the same author wrote: &quot;It fostered internal competition and resulted in many ground-breaking computer systems like the PDP and VAX lines.&quot;

====Matrix Management 2.0====
In 2004, despite matrix management having become disfavored, Nokia made an attempt at using a form of it, later described as &quot;matrix management 2.0&quot;. The focus is intended to be &quot;leading without authority&quot; so that &quot;no one functional leader is in charge.&quot;

==Academic overview==

* Christopher A. Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal writing on matrix management in the Harvard Business Review, quoted a line manager saying “The challenge is not so much to build a matrix structure as it is to create a matrix in the minds of our managers”. 
* “Designing Matrix Organizations That Actually Work” Jay R. Galbraith says “Organization structures do not fail, but management fails at implementing them successfully.” He argues that strategy, structure, processes, rewards and people all need to be aligned in a successful matrix implementation.
* “Making the Matrix Work: How Matrix Managers Engage People and Cut through Complexity”, Kevan Hall identifies a number of specific matrix management challenges in an environment where accountability without control, and influence without authority, become the norm:
** Context – ensure that people understand the reasoning behind the matrix
** Cooperation – improve cooperation across the silos, but avoid bureaucracy and having too many people involved
** Control – avoid centralization, build trust, empower people
** Community – focus on the &quot;soft structure&quot; of networks, communities, teams and groups

<doc id="1134983" wikidata="Q1665967" url="?curid=1134983" title="Interdental consonant">
<text>Interdental consonants are produced by placing the tip of the tongue between the upper and lower front teeth. That differs from typical dental consonants, which are articulated with the tongue against the &quot;back&quot; of the upper incisors. No language is known to contrast interdental and dental consonants.

Interdental consonants may be transcribed with the extIPA subscript, plus superscript bridge, as in , if precision is required, but it is more common to transcribe them as advanced alveolars, as in .

Interdental consonants are rare cross-linguistically. Interdental realisations of otherwise-dental or alveolar consonants may occur as idiosyncrasies or as coarticulatory effects of a neighbouring interdental sound. The most commonly-occurring interdental consonants are the non-sibilant fricatives (sibilants may be dental but do not appear as interdentals). Apparently, interdentals do not contrast with dental consonants in any language.

Voiced and voiceless interdental fricatives appear in American English as the initial sounds of words like &#x27;then&#x27; and &#x27;thin&#x27;. In British English, the consonants are more likely to be dental .

An interdental occurs in some varieties of Italian, and it may also occur in some varieties of English though the distribution and the usage of interdental in English are not clear.

s are found in about a dozen Philippine languages, including Kagayanen (Manobo branch), Karaga Mandaya (Mansakan branch), Kalagan (Mansakan branch), Southern Catanduanes Bicolano, and several varieties of Kalinga,
as well as in the Bauchi languages of Nigeria.

Interdental occurs in some dialects of Amis. Mapuche has interdental , , and .

In most Indigenous Australian languages, there is a series of &quot;dental&quot; consonants, written &quot;th&quot;, &quot;nh&quot;, and (in some languages) &quot;lh&quot;. They are always laminal (pronounced by touching with the blade of the tongue) but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, the speaker, and how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. They are apical interdental with the &quot;tip&quot; of the tongue visible between the teeth, as in &quot;th&quot; in American English; laminal interdental with the tip of the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the &quot;blade&quot; is visible between the teeth; and denti-alveolar , that is, with both the tip and the blade making contact with the back of the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;l&quot;.

<text>The men&#x27;s Swedish Open (sponsored by Skistar) is an ATP Tour 250 tennis tournament on the ATP Tour held in Båstad, Sweden in July.

The women&#x27;s Swedish Open (sponsored by Collector) is a tennis tournament held in Båstad, Sweden, between 2009 and 2017 as an International tournament and successor to the Nordic Light Open in Stockholm, and from 2019 onwards a challenger-level tournament. It is played on outdoor clay courts.

==History==
The Swedish Open was first held in 1948 when it was called the &quot;International Swedish Hard Court Championships&quot;. Between 1970 and 1989 the men&#x27;s event was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit.

The first three tournaments were won by Eric Sturgess from South Africa. Other famous champions include Ilie Năstase (1971), Björn Borg (1974, 1978–1979), Mats Wilander (1982–1983, 1985), and Rafael Nadal (2005).
The stadium in which the tournament is held underwent reconstruction in 2002 to accommodate the new hotel underneath the seaside bleachers.

From 1948 to 1990, there was also a women&#x27;s singles tournament. After the Nordic Light Open in Stockholm was sold, it was announced that the women&#x27;s event would return to Båstad. Since 2009 the Collector Swedish Open Women in Båstad has been an International-level tournament. In 2018 the women&#x27;s tournament license was sold and it was held in Moscow (Russia) as Moscow River Cup from 22 to 27 July 2018. However, in 2019, the tournaments was reinstated as WTA 125K series tournament.

===Title sponsors===
====ATP====
The tournament has in the latter years been named after its principal sponsor. These sponsors have changed, thus changing the name of the tournament. Title sponsors include:

*&quot;Investor Swedish Open&quot; (19??–1999), sponsored by Investor AB
*&quot;Wideyes Swedish Open&quot; (2000), sponsored by Wideyes
*&quot;Telenordia Swedish Open&quot; (2001–2002), sponsored by Telenordia
*&quot;Synsam Swedish Open&quot; (2003–2006), sponsored by Synsam
*&quot;Catella Swedish Open&quot; (2007–2009), sponsored by Catella
*&quot;SkiStar Swedish Open&quot; (2010–2019), sponsored by Skistar
* Nordea Open (2019 (cancelled) – present) sponsorer by Nordea

====WTA====
The tournament was sponsored by Ericsson until the Women&#x27;s and Men tournament shared title sponsor first with Skistar and then currently Nordea

===International Series Tournament of the Year===
Each year, the players on the ATP Tour vote for the ATP Tournament of the Year. Swedish Open has received this honor eleven consecutive years, winning the &quot;International Series Tournament of the Year&quot; in the ATP 250 category from 2002 to 2012. The Swedish Open is the only tournament to have won this award eleven times.

<doc id="1135006" wikidata="Q5378673" url="?curid=1135006" title="English terms with diacritical marks">
<text>English rarely uses diacritics, which are symbols indicating the modification of a letter&#x27;s sound when spoken. Most of the affected words are in terms imported from other languages. Certain diacritics are often called &quot;accents&quot;. The only diacritic native to Modern English is the two dots (representing a vowel hiatus): its usage has tended to fall off except in certain publications and particular cases. 

Proper nouns are not generally counted as English terms except when accepted into the language as an eponym – such as Geiger–Müller tube.

Unlike continental European languages, English orthography tends to use digraphs (like &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;oo&quot;, and &quot;ea&quot;) rather than diacritics to indicate more sounds than can be accommodated by the letters of the Latin alphabet. Unlike other systems (such as Spanish orthography) where the spelling indicates the pronunciation, English spelling is highly varied, and diacritics alone would be insufficient to make it reliably phonetic. (See .)

==Types of diacritical marks==

Though limited, the following diacritical marks in English may be encountered, particularly for marking in poetry:
* the acute accent (née) and grave accent (English poetry marking, changèd), modifying vowels or marking stresses
* the circumflex (entrepôt), borrowed from French
* the diaeresis (Zoë), indicating a second syllable in two consecutive vowels
* the macron (English poetry marking, lēad pronounced , not ), lengthening vowels, as in Māori; or indicating omitted n or m (in pre-Modern English, both in print and in handwriting).
* the breve (English poetry marking, drŏll pronounced , not ), shortening vowels
* the umlaut (über), altering Germanic vowels
* the cedilla (soupçon, façade), in French, Portuguese and Catalan it is a softening c, indicating &#x27;s-&#x27; not &#x27;k-&#x27; pronunciation
* the tilde (Señor, João), in Spanish indicating palatalised n, and Portuguese indicating nasal a and o (although in Spanish and most source languages, the tilde is not considered a diacritic over the letter n but rather as an integral part of the distinct letter ñ; in Portuguese the sound is represented by &quot;nh&quot;)

Less common diacritics are occasionally found in English-language publications to preserve the native rendering of names of people, places, and culturally significant items such as food. For example, the caron in Karel Čapek; the ring in  Åland; or &quot;phở&quot; with the Vietnamese letter Ơ (O with horn) with hook above.

===Special characters===
Some sources distinguish &quot;diacritical marks&quot; (marks upon standard letters in the A–Z 26-letter alphabet) from &quot;special characters&quot; (letters not marked but radically modified from the standard 26-letter alphabet) such as Old English and Icelandic eth (Ð, ð) and thorn (uppercase Þ, lowercase þ), and ligatures such as Latin and Anglo-Saxon Æ (minuscule: æ), and German eszett (ß; final -ß, often -ss even in German and always in Swiss Standard German).

The reverse of &quot;special characters&quot; is when foreign digraphs, such as Welsh ll in Llanelli, Dutch ij, or Croatian nj (same in Serbian and Bosnian) are simply treated as two standard A–Z characters.

==Native English words==
In some cases, the diacritic is not borrowed from any foreign language but is purely of English origin. The second of two vowels in a hiatus can be marked with a diaeresis (or &quot;tréma&quot;) – as in words such as &quot;coöperative&quot;, &quot;daïs&quot; and &quot;reëlect&quot; – but its use has become less common, sometimes being replaced by the use of a hyphen. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; under Jason Pontin have maintained such usage as house styles.

The diaeresis mark is also in rare cases used over a single vowel to show that it is pronounced separately (as in &quot;Brontë&quot;). 

The acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (rébel vs. rebél) or nonstandard for metrical reasons (caléndar); the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (warnèd, parlìament).

===In historical versions of English===

The Old English Latin alphabet began to replace the Runic alphabet in the 8th century, due to the influence of Celtic Christian missionaries to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Orthography of Old English – which was entirely handwritten in its own time – was not well standardized, though it did not use all the Latin letters, and included several letters not present in the modern alphabet. When reprinted in modern times, an overdot is occasionally used with two Latin letters to differentiate sounds for the reader:
* ċ is used for a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /t͡ʃ/
* ġ for a palatal approximant /j/ (probably a voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/ in the earliest texts)

Some modern printings also apply diacritics to vowels following the rules of Old Norse normalized spelling developed in the 19th century.

In the Late Middle English period, the shape of the English letter þ (thorn), which was derived from the Runic alphabet, evolved in some handwritten and blackletter texts to resemble the Latin letter y. The þ shape survived into the era of printing presses only as far as the press of William Caxton. In later publications, thorn was represented by &quot;y&quot;, or by ẏ to distinguish thorn from y. By the end of the Early Modern English period, thorn had been completely replaced in contemporary usage by the digraph &quot;th&quot; (reviving a practice from early Old English), and the overdot was no longer needed outside of printings of very old texts. The overdot is missing from the only surviving usage of a Y-shaped thorn, in the archaic stock phrase ye olde (from &quot;þe olde&quot;, pronounced &quot;the old&quot;, but &quot;ye olde&quot; is often misread and pronounced with the modern &quot;y&quot; sound).

== Words imported from other languages ==
Loanwords, or sometimes more precisely called borrowed words, have entered the English language from foreign languages by a process of naturalisation, or specifically anglicisation, which is carried out mostly unconsciously (a similar process occurs in all other languages). During this process, there is a tendency to adapt the original word: this includes accents and other diacritics being dropped (for example French &quot;hôtel&quot; and French &quot;rôle&quot; becoming &quot;hotel&quot; and &quot;role&quot; respectively in English, or French &quot;à propos&quot;, which lost both the accent and space to become English &quot;apropos&quot;).

In many cases, imported words can be found in print in both their accented and unaccented versions. Since modern dictionaries are mostly descriptive and no longer prescribe outdated forms, they increasingly list unaccented forms, though some dictionaries, such as the Oxford English Dictionary, do not list the unaccented variants of particular words (e.g., soupçon).

Words that retain their accents often do so to help indicate pronunciation (e.g. &quot;frappé&quot;, &quot;naïve&quot;, &quot;soufflé&quot;), or to help distinguish them from an unaccented English word (e.g. &quot;exposé&quot; vs. expose, &quot;résumé&quot; vs. resume, &quot;rosé&quot; vs. rose). Technical terms or those associated with specific fields (especially cooking or musical terms) are less likely to lose their accents (such as the French &quot;crème brûlée&quot;, &quot;étude&quot;, &quot;façade&quot;).

Some Spanish words with the Spanish letter &quot;ñ&quot; have been naturalised by substituting English &quot;ny&quot; (e.g., Spanish &quot;cañón&quot; is now usually English &quot;canyon&quot;, Spanish &quot;piñón&quot; is now usually English &quot;pinyon pine&quot;). Certain words, like &quot;piñata&quot;, &quot;jalapeño&quot; and &quot;quinceañera&quot;, are usually kept intact. In many instances the &quot;ñ&quot; is replaced with the plain letter &quot;n&quot;. In words of German origin (e.g. doppelgänger), the letters with umlauts &quot;ä, ö, ü&quot; may be written &quot;ae, oe, ue&quot;. This could be seen in many newspapers during World War II, which printed &quot;Fuehrer&quot; for &quot;Führer&quot;. However, today umlauts are usually either left out, with no &quot;e&quot; following the previous letter, or included as written in German (as in &quot;The New York Times&quot; or &quot;The Economist&quot;). Zurich is an exception since it is not a case of a &quot;dropped umlaut&quot;, but is a genuine English exonym, used also in French (from Latin &quot;Turicum&quot;)—therefore it may be seen written without the umlaut even alongside other German and Swiss names that retain the umlaut. The German letter ß is usually replaced in English by ‘ss’. This is seen in names such as Pascal Groß.

===Accent-addition and accent-removal===
As words are naturalized into English, sometimes diacritics are added to imported words that originally did not have any, often to distinguish them from common English words or to otherwise assist in proper pronunciation. In the cases of maté from Spanish &quot;mate&quot; (; ), animé from Japanese anime, and &quot;latté&quot; or even &quot;lattè&quot; from Italian &quot;latte&quot; (; ), an accent on the final &quot;e&quot; indicates that the word is pronounced with at the end, rather than the &quot;e&quot; being silent. Examples of a partial removal include resumé (from the French résumé) and haček (from the Czech háček) because of the change in pronunciation of the initial vowels. Complete naturalization stripping all diacritics also has occurred, in words such as &quot;canyon&quot;, from the Spanish &quot;cañón&quot;. For accurate readings, some speech writers use diacritics to differentiate homographs, such as &quot;lēad&quot; (pronounced like &quot;liːd&quot;) and &quot;lĕad&quot; (pronounced like &quot;lɛd&quot;).

In reverent and slightly poetic usage are commonly two -ed suffixed adjectives, if prefixed by a superlative, “learnèd” whereas rarely so “belovèd”. These are pronounced with two and three syllables respectively, unlike their related past participle versions. In courts, “my learnèd friend” is for any other specific representative at the bar, “the learnèd judge” for any cited judge and “this/the learnèd professor” or any other contributor’s title for anyone else cited who is legally highly qualified. Many wedding ceremonies begin “Dearly belovèd”, whether correctly spelt this way or not. This list expands to almost all -ed words in hymns and old rhymes if by chance helping with rhythm, emphasis or musical cadence. The, to some clerics, mildly blasphemous, quiet, polite curse “the blessèd (object)” still features in most British dialects, it being more reserved to main liturgy as the blessèd Virgin Mary, our blessèd saviour and blessèd are the poor, they who mourn and others upon whom the New Testament confirms unconditional blessing.

== Regional differences ==
===Canada===
In Canadian English, words of French origin retain their orthography more often than in other English-speaking countries, such as the usage of é (e with acute) in &quot;café, Montréal, née, Québec, and &quot;résumé&quot;. This is due to the large influence afforded by French being one of Canada&#x27;s two official languages at the federal government level as well as at the provincial level in New Brunswick and Manitoba, and the majority and sole official language in Québec.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand from the early 21st century, loan words in English that were assimilated from Māori language antecedents, have increasingly been replaced by the original Māori words, with their corresponding macrons (which indicate vowel length). This practice was adopted by the main newspaper chains in May 2018 to show respect for the official status of Maori. This shift primarily reflects changing social attitudes as part of the ongoing Māori Renaissance, and is sometimes followed in English usage outside New Zealand when writing about New Zealand topics. In some areas, such as the Waikato, use of a macron is replaced by a double vowel instead (eg. instead of ), typically in areas where local Māori dialects prefer usage of a double vowel. A diaeresis has sometimes been used (&quot;Mäori&quot;) in place of a macron where the technical capacity to apply a macron diacritic is limited.

== Regional dialects ==
Diacritics have been employed in the orthographies of some regional dialects in England.
* Grave accents and macrons are used in some orthographies of Cumbrian in words such as &quot;steàn&quot; &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;seùner&quot; &quot;sooner&quot; and &quot;pūnd&quot; &quot;pound&quot;.
* Diaereses are used in the Lincolnshire dialect, for example &quot;stoän&quot; &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;goä&quot; &quot;go&quot; and &quot;maäke&quot; &quot;make&quot;.
* Grave accents, circumflexes and diaereses are used in the Dorset dialect, in words such as &quot;mornèn&quot; &quot;morning&quot;, &quot;drîth&quot; &quot;dryness&quot; or &quot;drought&quot; and &quot;ceäkes&quot; &quot;cakes&quot;.

==Names with diacritics==
Diacritics are used in the names of some English-speaking people:
* British: Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë (and other members of the Brontë family), Noël Coward, Zoë Wanamaker, Emeli Sandé, John le Carré
* American: Beyoncé Knowles, Chloë Grace Moretz, Chloë Sevigny, Renée Fleming, Renée Zellweger, Zoë Baird, Zoë Kravitz, Donté Stallworth, John C. Frémont, Robert M. Gagné, Roxanne Shanté, Janelle Monáe, Jhené Aiko, Louise Glück
* Australian: Renée Geyer, Zoë Badwi

==Typographical limitations==
The early days of metal type printing quickly faced problems of not just simple diacritical marks for English, and accents for French and German, but also musical notation (for sheet music printing) and Greek and Hebrew alphabets (for Bible printing). However problems with representation of diacritical marks continued even in scholarly publishing and dissertations up to the word processor era. Mechanical typewriter keyboards manufactured for English-speaking countries seldom include diacritics.

The first generation of word processors also had character set limitations, and confusion due to typesetting convention was exacerbated in the character coded environment due to limitations of the ASCII character set.

<doc id="1135008" wikidata="Q1197175" url="?curid=1135008" title="Keisuke Kuwata">
<text>is a Japanese multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, and frontman for the Southern All Stars, as well of his own solo band, the Kuwata band. He has also done a significant amount of scoring music for films. He went to Aoyama Gakuin University.

In 2010, Southern All Stars was ranked No. 1, and Kuwata&#x27;s solo band, the Kuwata Band, ranked No. 12 on HMV Japan&#x27;s list of the top 100 musicians in Japan.

Kuwata has worked as a record producer, a movie director, has recorded albums as bandleader of his own band, the Kuwata Band, and has worked on projects scoring music to film.

== Biographical information ==
Keisuke Kuwata was born February 26, 1956, and raised in Chigasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

Kuwata&#x27;s wife, Yuko Hara, is also a member of the Southern All Stars. She is a vocalist and plays keyboards. The two met while in college, where they were in the same circle of musicians.　They married in 1982, after the success of the band&#x27;s single Chako no Kaiganmonogatari, and invited 3000 fans of the band to their wedding reception. They share a love of the blues and have two sons together.

On July 28, 2010, Kuwata announced that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. The operation to remove the cancer was successful and he has made several public appearances since June 2011.

== Musical style ==
Kuwata plays guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. For one album, &quot;Suteki Na Mirai Wo Mite Hoshii&quot; (素敵な未来を見て欲しい), Kuwata played every musical instrument and recorded the entire album himself.

Kuwata&#x27;s Western musical influences are varied. Along with his wife, the band&#x27;s keyboardist and backing vocalist, Yuko Hara, the couple have long been inspired by American folk music, where preferences run from Bob Dylan, the Band, Blues, and Southern rock music, to British and American influences that are arguably pure rock and Roll; with a flattering number of songs covered from the work of Eric Clapton.

Aside from Dylan, Kuwata&#x27;s work has shown emphasis on music of the American South, including that of Creedence Clearwater Revival and Little Feat. Along with the Southern All Stars, Kuwata has performed with Little Feat on several occasions, and recorded cover songs from the band. He was a participant and performer in a tribute concert to the late Lowell George, (Little Feat&#x27;s original frontman), recording a medley on video that contained his version of &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;.

In 1990, American musician Ray Charles released an English-language version of &quot;Ellie My Love&quot;, a song whose music and original Japanese lyrics were written by Kuwata, on Charles&#x27;s album &quot;Would You Believe?&quot; The song was already successful in Japan prior to the album&#x27;s release, having been used in a Japanese television commercial.

In 1991, Kuwata began a series of concerts, similar to &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performances, called the &quot;Acoustic Revolution&quot;, featuring Hirokazu Ogura on guitar, and Yoshiyuki Sahashi on mandolin, along with other musicians using acoustic instruments. Here again, Dylan&#x27;s influence shone through their work choosing standards including &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;.

Kuwata also developed a love for rock music. The influence from Eric Clapton is strong and can be heard even when Kuwata performs songs in same manner and style as those that Clapton himself covered, and did not write. In addition, other artists covered have been Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, and Sam Cooke.

In 1994, the &quot;On Air Music Fair&quot;, &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; by Bob Marley was performed by Kuwata and Ann Lewis.

== Philanthropy ==

Kuwata has performed with his band, and collaborated with several others annually to donate money towards AIDS research and treatment. To draw the largest possible audiences, Kuwata performs additional Western songs so the concerts are more inclusive. Depending upon the year of the concert, sometimes the chosen songs have a theme.

Kuwata has been joined in benefit concerts by other bands and musicians. Most notable is the frequent appearance of , a band featuring guitarists and . The band features a combination of jazz, blues, and rock, along with their own combination of ambient experimental music. Yamagen is considered a &quot;guitar support unit&quot;, in the same way Westerners would think of a horn section. Some of these concert songs included:

* 1996 Theme: Jazz Cafe
* 1997 Theme: Kayou Suspense Theater
* 1998 Theme: All Request Show
* 1999 Theme: Eric Claptoso
** &quot;Little Wing&quot;, by Jimi Hendrix, and &quot;Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?&quot;, recorded by Eric Clapton several decades earlier.

<text>Peter Adair (November 25, 1943 – June 27, 1996) was a filmmaker and artist, best known for his pioneering gay and lesbian documentary &quot;Word Is Out: Stories of Some of Our Lives&quot; (1977).

==Early life==
Adair was born in Los Angeles County in 1943. He grew up in New Mexico, where his father, John, was an anthropologist who studied the Navajo people.
He went to Antioch College (based in Yellow Springs, Ohio).

==Career==
Adair entered the film industry in the 1960s and first gained critical attention with his 1967 documentary &quot;Holy Ghost People&quot;, a film record of a Pentecostal snake handler worship service in the Appalachians. After he realised he was gay, he decided to make a film about it. From 1975 to 1977, he collaborated with his lesbian sister Nancy Adair and other members of the Mariposa Film Group to produce and direct &quot;Word Is Out: Stories of Some of Our Lives&quot;. The film, the first of its kind to present gays and lesbians in a positive light, was a critical hit nationwide. &quot;Word Is Out&quot; inspired Nancy to collaborate with Casey Adair, Peter and Nancy&#x27;s mother, on a companion book, published in 1978. Peter Adair always chose the subject matter for his film based on his current passions, and &quot;Word Is Out&quot; was as much a vital part of his own coming out process as it was an attempt to show gays and lesbians in a very human and non-sensational manner.

In 1984 Adair produced and directed &quot;Stopping History&quot;, which examined ethical questions around nuclear weapons. Then in 1984 acted as consultant and did additional camerawork on &quot;The Times of Harvey Milk&quot;, directed by his former protégé Rob Epstein. That same year he worked with the Project Read adult literacy program of the San Francisco Public Library to produce a series of tutoring videos.

In 1986, he made &quot;Modern Selling&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek industrial film, made in a mock-&#x27;40s style, that shows bank loan officers how to treat their female clients.

===Late career===
As he began to see his friends in the art and film communities succumb to the plague of AIDS, Adair co-directed, with Rob Epstein, &quot;The AIDS Show: Artists Involved in Death and Survival&quot;, one of the first films to examine AIDS&#x27; impact on the arts community, in 1986. When he became aware of his own HIV status, he wrote and directed &quot;Absolutely Positive&quot; in 1991, an examination of how asymptomatic HIV positive people live with uncertainty. The 11 interviewees are seen at different stages of the disease and how they are coping with their illnesses in different ways. Peter and his producer Janet Cole, had interviewed 120 people before selecting the 11 most interesting including; Doris, a soprano in her Baptist church choir who discovered she was HIV positive when her baby son was diagnosed with AIDS; Gregg, a gay San Francisco-based model, and Juan, a young husband and father who was infected by his late first wife, a drug addict.

In 1995, Adair and Haney Armstrong completed &quot;In the First Degree,&quot; an interactive CD-ROM featuring live actors. It was published by Broderbund Software.

In January 1996, he received The Frameline Award (Given in San Francisco to a person or entity that has made a major contribution to LGBT representation in film, television, or the media arts).

In June 1996, Adair succumbed to complications of AIDS at the age of 52 in Bernal Heights, San Francisco.

==Awards==
He won many awards, including the Columbia-Dupont Citation for Broadcast Excellence, Golden Gate Award, EMMY, James D. Phelan Award, Distinguished Documentary Achievement, Blue Ribbon, Red Ribbon, American Film Festival and the Prix l&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or.

<text>Otis Junior Nixon (born January 9, 1959) is an American former professional baseball center fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees (1983), Cleveland Indians (1984–87), Montreal Expos (1988–90), Atlanta Braves (1991–93, 1999), Boston Red Sox (1994), Texas Rangers (1995), Toronto Blue Jays (1996–97), Los Angeles Dodgers (1997), Minnesota Twins (1998), and a final return to the Atlanta Braves (1999), in a career that spanned from 1983 to 1999. Nixon stole more bases than any other player during the 1990s (478). He also has the most career stolen bases (620) for a player who never appeared in an MLB All-Star game since it began in 1933.

==Career==
In the minor leagues, Nixon led the league twice in stolen bases ( in the South Atlantic League with 67 &amp; in the International League with 94), runs scored (1980 in the South Atlantic League with 124 &amp; 1983 in the International League with 129), hits (162 in 1983 in the International League), at bats (557 in 1983 in the International League) and walks (57 in 1979 in the Appalachian League, 113 in 1980 in the South Atlantic League and 110 in 1981 in the Southern League). He started out as an infielder but was switched to outfield in 1983 due to his superior speed and frequency of errors (56 in 127 games in 1981 at shortstop for the Nashville Sounds). In 1982, Nixon stole 107 bases in a combined season between the AA level Nashville Sounds and the AAA level Columbus Clippers.

In 17 seasons Nixon played with the New York Yankees (1983), Cleveland Indians (1984–87), Montreal Expos (1988–90), Atlanta Braves (1991–93. 1999), Boston Red Sox (1994), Texas Rangers (1995), Toronto Blue Jays (1996–97), Los Angeles Dodgers (1997) and Minnesota Twins (1998).

Nixon shares the single game stolen base Major League record with 6 on June 16, 1991. He held the Atlanta Braves single season record for stolen bases with 72 in 1991; the record was broken by Ronald Acuña Jr. in 2023.

On July 25, 1992, Nixon made a catch over the wall to rob Andy Van Slyke of a home run, a catch that was replayed many times on sports news programs. Nixon made the final out of the 1992 World Series attempting to bunt for a base hit with a runner on third and 2 out in extra innings of Game 6. Nixon had successfully bunted for base hits many times for the Braves. On his previous at-bat, Nixon had singled home the tying run (swinging, not bunting) with 2 out in the bottom of the ninth to send Game 6 to extra innings. It was the second World Series in history to end on a bunt. (Lee Lacy of the Dodgers popped out on a bunt attempt to end the 1977 World Series.)

In the 1999 National League Championship Series, 40-year-old Nixon made one of the key plays to save the series for the Braves. After the Braves had blown 5–0 and 7–3 leads in Game 6 and trailed 8–7 in the 8th inning, Nixon, a pinch runner at first base with one out, changed the momentum of the game and the series by stealing second and going to third when the throw went into center field. Nixon went on to score the tying run, and the Braves eventually won the game and series in extra innings.

In his career, Nixon batted .270 with 11 home runs, 318 RBI, 878 runs, 1,379 hits, 142 doubles, 27 triples, and 620 stolen bases in 1,709 games. In his postseason career, Nixon hit .321 with a .396 on-base percentage, 13 runs and 11 stolen bases in 24 games. In eight career World Series games, Nixon hit .310 with five stolen bases.

==Personal life==
Nixon&#x27;s younger brother, Donell Nixon, is also a former Major League Baseball player, playing from 1987 until 1990.

Nixon battled a cocaine habit for much of his career. He was arrested on drug charges in 1987 while a member of the Cleveland Indians organization. Nixon failed a drug test in September 1991 and was suspended for 60 days, which caused him to miss the 1991 World Series.

In 2000, he married former R&amp;B singer Perri Reid. They divorced in 2004.

In an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on SiriusXM, Nixon discussed how he overcame his demons and conquered his drug and alcohol addiction.

Nixon married gospel artist Candi Staton in 2010. They divorced in 2012.
Nixon was arrested May 4, 2013, in Cherokee County, Georgia, after a crack rock and pipe were found in his vehicle during a traffic stop.

On April 9, 2017, Nixon was reported missing by the Woodstock Police Department in Woodstock, Georgia. He left his house that morning to go to a local golf course for a scheduled tee time, but did not arrive. On April 10, 2017, he was found safe by Woodstock Police.

<text>Richard de Lucy, Luci, Lucie, or Lusti (1089– 14 July 1179), also known as Richard the Loyal, was first noted as High Sheriff of Essex, after which he was made Chief Justiciar of England.
==Life==
The De Lucy family took its surname from Lucé in southern Normandy, then still held by the English kings. Richard inherited from his father estates in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent, and Normandy. His mother was Aveline, the niece and heiress of William Goth. In the charter for Sées Cathedral in February 1130–31 Henry I refers to Richard de Lucy and his mother, Aveline. His brother, Walter de Luci, was abbot of Battle Abbey. De Lucy&#x27;s wife, Rohese, who is named in several documents, was possibly a sister of Faramus de Boulogne. Rohese and Faramus were children of William de Boulogne who was the son of Geoffrey fitz Eustace (son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne) and Beatrice, daughter of Norman magnate Geoffrey de Mandeville.

An early reference to the family refers to the render by Henry I of the lordship of Diss, Norfolk to Richard de Lucy, Governor of Falaise, Normandy, after defending it with great valour and heroic conduct when besieged by Geoffrey, Earl of Anjou.

In 1153–4 De Lucy was granted Chipping Ongar, Essex by William, son of King Stephen and his wife, Maud of Boulogne. He may have built the motte-and-bailey Ongar Castle, although it is also attributed to Eustace II Count of Boulogne (). Richard de Lucy was appointed Sheriff of both Essex and Hertfordshire for 1156.
When Henry II came to the throne in 1154, De Lucy was made Chief Justiciar of England jointly with Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester. When de Beaumont died in 1168, De Lucy continued to hold the office in his own right. One of the members of his household was Roger fitzReinfrid, the brother of Walter de Coutances. Roger became a royal judge and later donated land to Lesnes Abbey in Kent, which had been founded by De Lucy.

He resigned his office between September 1178 and Easter of 1179, and retired to Lesnes Abbey, where, three months later on 14 July 1179, he died and was buried.

==Legacy==
Richard&#x27;s son Godfrey de Lucy entered the clergy and became bishop of Winchester (11891204). Richard&#x27;s eldest son Geoffrey de Lucy predeceased him and Geoffrey&#x27;s two sons Geoffrey and Richard died without children early in the reign of RichardI (r.11891199). This led to protracted litigation over his estate between Richard and Geoffrey&#x27;s daughters that lasted until the reign of HenryIII (r.12161272).

<text>Isaac Ellmaker Hiester (May 29, 1824 – February 6, 1871) was a nineteenth century American political leader. A member of the Hiester Family political dynasty, he was also descended from the prominent Ellmaker family. The son of William Hiester, he was also a cousin of Hiester Clymer.

A century after his death, he was memorialized by American newspapers as a &quot;distinguished Pennsylvania congressman and jurist.&quot;

==Biography==
Isaac E. Hiester was born in New Holland, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on May 29, 1824. He graduated from Yale University in 1842, and while at college helped to found the Scroll and Key Society. He then studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1845, afterwards practicing in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

In 1848, the Governor of Pennsylvania appointed Hiester as Deputy Attorney General (District Attorney) for Lancaster County; he held the post until 1851.

In 1852, he successfully ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives as a Whig. He was defeated for reelection in 1854, and ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat in 1856. Hiester then returned to his law practice.

He supported the Union during the American Civil War, was a Delegate to the 1868 Democratic National Convention, and also represented Pennsylvania on the Democratic National Committee.

==Illness, death, burial and tributes==
On January 28, 1871, Isaac E. Hiester suffered a stroke which left him paralyzed. Lingering &quot;in a semi-conscious condition, never speaking, but being able to recognize the friends who gathered around his bed in anxious solicitude,&quot; he died at his home in Lancaster on February 6, 1871.

Within a day of his death, multiple tributes were written about him by attorneys, elected officials and other civic leaders, and published in local newspapers. More than fifty attorneys also attended the Lancaster Bar Association on February 7, 1871, &quot;the largest of the kind, except that which assembled on the decease of President Buchanan, ever witnessed in Lancaster.&quot; Thomas E. Franklin, Esq., formerly Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, was the first to speak, noting:

&quot;I feel utterly incapable, sir, of performing, properly, the grave duty that I feel pressing upon me. It is a mournful task for me to rise here and announce to you, who knew him so well and esteemed him so highly, the sudden decease of Isaac E. Hiester... The unexpected blow unnerves and overpowers me... His was the highest sense of honor, his was the purest integrity... He was generous without a spark of ostentation in his charity; he could not see suffering without relieving it.&quot;

Oliver James Dickey, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, said of Hiester:

&quot;The descendant on his father&#x27;s side of one of the oldest and best German families of the State, and of another almost as old and as well-known on the part of his mother; an only son ... born to wealth and highly educated, this great country looked to see what career Isaac E. Hiester would carve out for himself... His word was as good as his bond, and no man&#x27;s bond was better. In his professional career he adopted the highest standard of professional morals, and he lived religiously up to his creed. No man&#x27;s cause was hindered, or delayed from malice, or for lucre by him. He kept his lightest promises sacred, and was especially careful to do so if they might be to the advantage of his opponent or to his own prejudice... He always brought complete preparation to the trial of his causes, and was equally distinguished for that whether he appeared before a jury or a court of the last resort... He was a worthy son of that great German race, which has given to Pennsylvania its best Governors, and which has converted this wide county, and almost the whole eastern part of this State, into a garden.&quot;

Samuel H. Reynolds, former Lancaster city solicitor, said:

&quot;I cannot remain silent beside his open coffin. He possessed a peculiar eloquence which was calculated to sway both Court and jury, was a man of the highest honor and elevated character. In private life he displayed all the finer feelings of human nature. This Bar has met with irreparable loss in the death of Mr. Hiester... He needs no eulogy. His virtues will outlive the marble which may mark his last resting place, and his memory will be preserved when the pillars of this temple of justice, in which his eloquent voice was so often heard, shall have crumbled into dust.&quot;

During the fall of 1871, a new lectern was installed in his memory at St. James Episcopal Church in Lancaster. It was described by local newspapers as &quot;one of the finest specimens in sculpture in wood yet executed in this country,&quot; and featured an &quot;eagle resting upon a massive pillar, with elaborate capital of black oak.&quot;

<doc id="1135049" wikidata="Q861530" url="?curid=1135049" title="Royal Malaysian Navy">
<text>The Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN, ; Jawi: ) is the naval arm of the Malaysian Armed Forces. RMN is the main agency responsible for the country&#x27;s maritime surveillance and defence operations. RMN&#x27;s area of operation consists of 603,210 square kilometers covering the country&#x27;s coastal areas and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). RMN also bears the responsibility of controlling the country&#x27;s main Sea Lines of Communications (SLOC) such as the Straits of Malacca and the Straits of Singapore and also monitors national interests in areas with overlapping claims such as in Spratly.

==History==
===Straits Settlement Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve===
The Royal Malaysian Navy can trace its roots to the formation of the Straits Settlement Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (SSRNVR) in Singapore on 27 April 1934 by the British colonial government in Singapore. The SSRNVR was formed to assist the Royal Navy in the defence of Singapore, upon which the defence of the Malay Peninsula was based. Also behind its formation were political developments in Asia, particularly the rise of a Japan that was increasingly assertive in Asia. In 1938, the SSRNVR was expanded with a branch in Penang. On 18 January 1935, the British Admiralty presented Singapore with an , , to serve as the Reserve&#x27;s Headquarters and drill ship. It was berthed at the Telok Ayer Basin. HMS &quot;Laburnum&quot; was sunk in February 1942, prior to the capitulation of Singapore at the beginning of Second World War activities in the Pacific.

With the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, the SSRNVR increased the recruitment of mainly indigenous personnel into the force, to beef up local defences as Royal Navy resources were required in Europe. Members of the SSRNVR were called up to active duty and the force was augmented by members of the Royal Navy Malay Section. This formed the basis of the navy in Malaya, called the Malay Navy, manned by indigenous Malay personnel. (Similarly, the Malays were recruited into the fledgling Malay Regiment formed in 1936). The Malay Navy had a strength of 400 men who received their training at HMS Pelandok, the Royal Navy training establishment in Malaya. Recruitment was increased and in 1941 at the outbreak of the war in Asia, the Malay Navy had a strength of 1,450 men. Throughout the Second World War, the Malay Navy served with the Allied Forces in the Indian and Pacific theatre of operations. When the war ended with the Japanese Surrender in 1945, only 600 personnel of the Malay Navy reported for muster. Post war economic constraints saw the disbandment of the Malay Navy in 1947.

===After world war II – Formation of the Malayan Naval Force===

The Malay Navy was reactivated on 24 December 1948 at the outbreak of the Malayan Emergency, the communist-inspired insurgent war against the British colonial government. The Malayan Naval Force (MNF) regulation was gazetted on 4 March 1949 by the colonial authorities and was based at an ex-Royal Air Force radio base station in Woodlands, Singapore. The base was called the &#x27;MNF Barracks&#x27; but was later renamed HMS &quot;Malaya&quot;. The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) was reconstituted as a joint force comprising the Singapore Division and the Federation Division, by an Ordinance passed in Singapore in 1952. The main mission of the Malayan Naval Force (MNF) was coastal patrols to stop the communists receiving supplies from the sea. In addition, the Force was tasked with guarding the approaches to Singapore and other ports. The MNF was equipped with a , HMS &quot;Test&quot;, which was used as a training ship. By 1950, the MNF fleet had expanded to include the ex-Japanese minelayer HMS &quot;Laburnum&quot;, Landing Craft Tank (LCT) HMS &quot;Pelandok&quot; (&quot;Mousedeer&quot;), motor fishing vessel HMS &quot;Panglima&quot; (&quot;Marshal&quot;), torpedo recovery vessel HMS &quot;Simbang&quot; and several seaward defence motor launches (SDML). In August 1952, Queen Elizabeth II bestowed the title &quot;Royal Malayan Navy&quot; on the Malayan Naval Force in recognition of its sterling service in action during the Malayan Emergency.

===Independence===

On 12 July 1958, soon after attaining its independence on 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya negotiated with the British government to transfer British naval assets to the newly formed Royal Malayan Navy. With the hoisting of the Federation naval ensign – the White Ensign modified by the substituting the Union Flag with the Federation flag in the canton – the Royal Malayan Navy became responsible for Malaya&#x27;s maritime self-defence. The &quot;Royal&quot; in Royal Malayan Navy was now in reference to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who became the Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces. All ships, facilities and personnel serving in the Royal Malayan Navy were inherited by the Malayan government. The new force had an operational and training base at HMMS &quot;Malaya&quot; and a small coastal fleet of one LCT, one coastal minelayer, six s and seven Ton-class minesweeper (the ex-RN 200th Patrol Squadron) on transfer from the Royal Navy.

On 16 September 1963, the naval force was renamed the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), following the formation of Malaysia. Eighteen Keris-class were ordered from Vosper and formed the mainstay of the navy for years to come. These boats were driven by Maybach diesels and capable of . The &quot;Keris&quot; patrol boats were confined to coastal patrols and had short endurance. An offensive capability was acquired with the purchase of four s also known as Perkasa-class patrol boats in RMN service. The &quot;Perkasa&quot; patrol boats were built for the RMN by Vosper Thorneycroft in 1967, powered by three Rolls-Royce Marine Proteus gas turbines as the main power plant with two diesel auxiliary engines for cruising and manoeuvring. These were armed with four torpedoes, one Bofors 40 mm gun forward and one 20 mm cannon aft. They had a maximum speed of and was driven by triple propellers. The Royal Navy transferred the to the RMN in 1964 and renamed KD (&quot;Kapal Di-Raja&quot;, &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;) &quot;Hang Tuah&quot;. In 1965, during the Indonesian confrontation, &quot;Hang Tuah&quot; took over guardship duties off Tawau from . The ship served as the flagship of the RMN until it was decommissioned in the 1970s and scrapped. The RMN also used some of the decommissioned ship as a part of navy monument. This shop can be toured at Bandar Hilir, Melaka or at the Lumut Naval Base.

===Malaysianisation===

Following the end of Indonesian confrontation in 1966, Tunku Abdul Rahman and his colleagues decided to Malaysianise the top posts in the navy and air force. They offered these posts to two senior Malaysian army generals, who declined for two main reasons. First they felt that they were not professionally qualified and second because they did not want to jeopardise their own careers in the army. Tunku and his colleagues then decided that they would select two officers, one from the navy and one from the air force, and appoint them chiefs of their respective services. They were fully aware of Rear Admiral Datuk K. Thanabalasingam&#x27;s age —he was 31 years old and a bachelor- but decided to appoint him and take the risk. Under Thanabalasingam and with Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s foresight and will, they were responsible for initiating the gradual transformation of the navy from a coastal navy (brown water force) to a sea-going navy (green water navy).

===1970s onwards===
In 1977, the RMN acquired the frigate HMS &quot;Mermaid&quot; from the Royal Navy to replace the decommissioned &quot;Hang Tuah&quot;. The ship was also named , but retained HMS &quot;Mermaid&quot;″s pennant number of F76. &quot;Hang Tuah&quot; is a 2,300 standard ton light patrol frigate armed with twin 102 mm guns. &quot;Hang Tuah&quot; gradually reverted to a training role and continues in that role for the RMN. (ex-&quot;Hang Jebat&quot;) (F24) joined the RMN in 1972. The 2,300-ton ship was a one-off Yarrow light frigate design for the RMN. The ship was originally named &quot;Hang Jebat&quot; but renamed after initial propulsion problems during pre-commissioning trials. It was the first Malaysian naval vessel equipped with a missile (Seacat) system. &quot;Rahmat&quot; was decommissioned in 2004.

The RMN purchased several types of missile boats in the 1970s and 1980s. These were four Perdana-class missile boats purchased from France and four Handalan-class missile boats purchased from Sweden. Both classes were armed with the Exocet MM38 missiles. The RMN also acquired two 1,100-ton Musytari-class offshore patrol vessels of Korean design. Sealift requirements were met by the purchases of several ex-United States Navy World War II-era LSTs. KD &quot;Sri Langkawi&quot; (A1500), ex-, KD &quot;Sri Banggi&quot; (A1501), ex- and KD &quot;Rajah Jarom&quot; (A1502), ex-, were replaced by KD &quot;Sri Indera Pura&quot; (1505), the LST ex-. Additional sealift capability is provided by two 4,300-ton, 100-metre support ships, KD &quot;Sri Indera Sakti&quot; (1503) and KD &quot;Mahawangsa&quot; (1504). Minehunting capabilities are provided by four s. These are Italian-built ships based on the Lerici-class but displacing 610 tons. Hydrographic duties are handled by KD &quot;Perantau&quot; and KD &quot;Mutiara&quot;. A Naval Air Wing was also founded with the purchase of ex-Royal Navy Westland Wasps. Some ships of the RMN that have been decommissioned was transferred to the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA). MMEA had received more than 20 vessels from the RMN fleet to equip its enforcement operations from 2000s onwards.

===Modernisation===

The modernisation of the RMN began in the late 1980s. Four s were purchased from Italy. These compact ships were originally built for Iraq, but were not delivered due to international sanctions put in place against Iraq. A prominent addition to the fleet were two s. Based on the Yarrow F2000 design, the two 2,300-ton frigates are armed with Exocet MM40 II SSM and the Sea Wolf VLS point defence SAM system with accommodation for one Westland Super Lynx helicopter. Malaysia had planned to add new batch of &quot;Lekiu&quot; frigates but this was cancelled in August 2009. Complementing the two &quot;Lekiu&quot; frigates are two German-built &quot;Kasturi&quot;-class corvettes which were delivered in the early 1980s. Two Scorpène-class submarines were ordered by the RMN on 5 June 2002 under a €1.04 billion (about RM4.78 billion) contract to form the new submarine force. RMN also purchased six s and a batch of Littoral Mission Ships namely and &quot;Ada&quot;-class corvette to strengthen the fleet. In addition, the construction of new modern also will make the RMN as a formidable power in the region.

===Anti-piracy efforts===

The Royal Malaysian Navy has been patrolling the Gulf of Aden to thwart piracy since 2009. In January 2011, the navy foiled a hijacking attempt against the Malaysian-flagged chemical tanker MT &quot;Bunga Laurel&quot; carrying lubricating oil and ethylene dichloride. The navy ship KA &quot;Bunga Mas 5&quot; responded after receiving a distress signal from the ship. A Fennec attack helicopter was used to pin down the pirate mothership as commandos boarded the tanker. The commandos injured three pirates in the battle to re-take the ship. 23 sailors were rescued and seven Somali pirates were detained. According to an 11 February 2011 online breaking news update by CNN&#x27;s Brad Lendon, the seven Somalis, including three boys under 15 years old, could face the death penalty if convicted on charges of firing on Malaysian armed forces- navy commandos- while attempting to hijack the ship. The seven was sentenced for four to seven years in prison by Malaysian High Court on 2 September 2013. The ship was rescued from the coast of Oman.

The Royal Malaysian Navy was also involved in the operation to secure the release of that was hijacked in 2015 by a group of Indonesian pirates. All of the pirates were captured with the help of Vietnam Border Guard (VNBG), Vietnam Coast Guard (VNCG), Royal Australian Air Force and the Indonesian Navy.
===Sulu militants intrusion on Sabah===

Following the Sulu militants&#x27; intrusion, a military standoff lasted from 11 February 2013 until 24 March 2013 after 235 militants, most of whom were armed, arrived by boats in Lahad Datu, Sabah, Malaysia from Simunul island, Tawi-Tawi in the southern Philippines on 11 February 2013. The group, calling themselves the &quot;Royal Security Forces of the Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo&quot;, was sent by Jamalul Kiram III, one of the claimants to the throne of the Sultanate of Sulu. Kiram stated that their objective was to assert the unresolved territorial claim of the Philippines to the eastern part of Sabah (which is the former North Borneo).

Malaysian security forces surrounded the village of Tanduo in Lahad Datu where the group had gathered and after several weeks of negotiations and broken deadlines for the intruders to withdraw, security forces moved in and routed the militants. The Royal Malaysian Navy enforced a naval blockade during and after the standoff to ensure that no more Sulu militants would be able to reach Sabah. The assets allocated for the blockade included , KD &quot;Perak&quot;, KD &quot;Todak&quot;, among many others. The RMN also provided a naval special warfare unit for joint operations with army, air force and police commandos to track down and neutralise any militants left after the standoff.

===Offshore bases===

The Royal Malaysian Navy&#x27;s five naval stations were originally built on outlying atolls, with the most developed Station Lima now expanded to a comfortably habitable naval station and also a popular diving spot in the region, in contrast with its harsh original conditions in 1983. On 21 June 1980 a claim plaque was erected on the island and three years later eighteen PASKAL men went ashore in May 1983 to build the first encampment while braving the elements. At the time, the only infrastructure available was a helipad for personnel transfer and the sailors had to camp under the open skies on the bare reef. When the naval station proper was constructed six years later with the construction of a small living-cum-operations quarters, it was also decided that the enlarged island the atoll had become would also be developed as a tourist attraction so that the tourism potential of the island could be exploited.

Thus by 1995, more buildings were added, including two air-conditioned accommodation blocks, an aircraft landing strip, two hangars, a radar station, an air traffic control tower, watchtowers and a jetty. The aviation facilities on the island allow the operation of C-130 Hercules transport planes and CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. These facilities made the island a proper island station code-named Station Lima. Patrols by navy soldiers in CB90 attack boats and larger patrol vessels such as the Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels are carried out around the island. The Royal Malaysian Air Force also operate frequently on the airstrip. Several anti-ship and anti-aircraft guns are placed on several areas on the island and the RMAF personnel operate a Starburst air defence system to prevent low-level air attacks. The rest of the stations were originally floating barge type habitat modules constructed on mainland Malaysia. Location selection and module positioning was done during high tide so that they could be more easily anchored during low tide and after found satisfactory, the modules were landed and filled in with cement and rocks to strengthen their anchorages. They are all also equipped with radar and ship docking facilities as well as water and power generation facilities. Soldiers are stationed on all stations.

==Special forces==
The special forces of the RMN is known as PASKAL (Pasukan Khas Laut or Naval Special Warfare Forces). In peacetime, the unit is tasked with responding to maritime hijacking incidents as well as protecting Malaysia&#x27;s numerous offshore oil and gas platforms. Its wartime roles include seaborne infiltration, sabotaging of enemy naval assets and installations, and the defence of RMN vessels and bases. This unit is analogous to the United States Navy SEALs. On 15 April 2009, PASKAL was renamed KD Panglima Hitam (KD being the equivalent of HMS in the Royal Navy). The ceremony was held at the RMN Lumut Naval Base to honour PASKAL&#x27;s courage and loyalty to the nation. Panglima Hitam was the name given to brave and loyal Malay warriors who served during the golden age of the Malay Rulers (Sultans and Rajas) of Perak, Selangor, Johor and Negeri Sembilan.

==Equipment==
==Present development==

The navy has sought to modernise its fleet with the procurement of new vehicles through the New Generation Patrol Vessels (NGPV) program which produced the Kedah-class offshore patrol vessel and the Second Generation Patrol Vessel (SPGV) program which produced the Maharaja Lela-class frigate. It has also purchased Keris-class littoral mission ships (patrol vessels) and ordered three Ada-class corvettes to fulfill its Littoral Mission Ship (LMS) program. Additionally, the navy has plans to procure a new class of amphibious warfare ships, Multi Role Support Ship (MRSS), for its fleet. As part of a modernisation plan launched in 2014, the navy has also launched the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) upgrade program for aging vessels.

===&quot;Kedah&quot;-class New Generation Patrol Vessel===

In 1996, the RMN planned to acquire a total of 27 New Generation Patrol Vessels (NGPV) to full fill its future requirement. The German Blohm + Voss MEKO 100 based design was selected and a contract of six NGPVs was signed in 2003. However, due to management failure of the main contractor, PSC-Naval Dockyard Sdn Bhd (PSC-ND), progression was seriously delayed and led the programme into crisis. This may also affect the initial planned total number of NGPVs to be decreased. However, under the intervention of the Malaysian Government, Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation took over the PSC-ND, thus regaining momentum for the programme. After a long wait of 18 months, the first two hulls, KD &quot;Kedah&quot; commissioned in June 2006 and KD &quot;Pahang&quot; commissioned in August 2006. As of July 2009, all six ships had been launched. Subsequently, good progression of the programme has regained interest in the Malaysian decision makers to order the second batch of six NGPVs. Navy Chief Admiral Datuk Abdul Aziz bin Jaafar had recently unveiled that the navy is interested to have the second batch of NGPV ASW configured. The ASW configured NGPV is expected to be able to co-ordinate operations with the Scorpène submarines. The ships will also be upgrade with missiles.

===Scorpène-class submarine===
Two s were ordered by the RMN on 5 June 2002 under a €1.04 billion (about RM4.78 billion) contract. The two Scorpène submarines were built jointly by the French shipbuilder, Naval Group and its Spanish partner, Navantia. They are armed with Blackshark wire-guided torpedoes and Exocet SM-39 sub-launched anti-ship missiles. The submarine programme also included the redeployment of an &quot;Agosta&quot;-class submarine retired from the French Navy, for the training of submarine crews. The training of 150 Malaysian sailors, mainly in Brest, France, represented an important aspect of the programme. In 2006, the RMN had launched a nationwide competition to select the names for the first two Malaysian submarines. On 26 July, RMN announced these vessels will be named after historic Malaysians. The first hull will be named KD &quot;Tunku Abdul Rahman&quot; and the second hull KD &quot;Tun Abdul Razak&quot;. These vessels are classified as &quot;Perdana Menteri&quot; class in service with RMN. The first vessel, KD &quot;Tunku Abdul Rahman&quot; was launched on 24 October 2007 at the Naval Group dockyard, Cherbourg, France.

On 3 September 2009, the first Scorpène submarine of Malaysia KD &quot;Tunku Abdul Rahman&quot;, arrived at a Port Klang naval base on peninsular Malaysia&#x27;s west coast after a 54-day voyage from France. Another base is also being constructed on Pulau Langkawi, Kedah to provide the RMN with readier access into the Indian Ocean. Ready access into the Pacific Ocean is available via the existing base at Semporna, Sabah. Defects and problems were found in the submarines such as the inability to submerge and faults in the coolant system of the first submarine, causing delays in the delivery of the second submarine. In October 2012, the Malaysian Navy chief Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Jaafar said that the submarines were in good condition and operational after all the defects repaired by manufacturer.

===Utility and anti-submarine helicopter===

<text>Diego Alonso Serna Lopera (born October 2, 1973) is a Colombian football player who last played for Miami Dade FC. He is the all-time leading scorer for the now-defunct Miami Fusion of Major League Soccer.

==Career==

===Early Career, Major League Soccer===
Serna began his career in his native Colombia with Cortuluá and Independiente Medellín, before moving to MLS with the expansion Fusion in 1998. He became the one constant in Miami&#x27;s lineup for the four years of the team&#x27;s existence, leading them in goals in points his first three seasons with the club. Overall, he ended up with team records of 100 games, 52 goals, 36 assists, and 140 points in the regular season, and added a goal and an assist in six playoff games. In 2001, he was named to the MLS Best XI.

The Fusion was contracted before the 2002 MLS season, so Serna was picked 4th overall in the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft by the MetroStars, who traded Mark Chung to obtain that pick. Diego only played eight games for the Metros, scoring one goal. He was traded to the New England Revolution in a six-player deal midway through the season, the other principal of which was Mamadou Diallo. Serna only scored one goal for the Revs in five games before his season was ended by an injury. He went back to Colombia to Atlético Nacional and Independiente Medellín, before returning to MLS in the middle of the 2003 season for a stint with the Los Angeles Galaxy, scoring three goals in ten games.

===Return to South America===
After spending some time playing in his native Colombia with Once Caldas and Deportes Quindío, Serna returned to MLS with the Colorado Rapids in August 2005. He then played for Macará of Ecuador in 2006, before joining Fast of Brazil in 2007 and 2008.

===USL===
Although Serna was an excellent goal-scorer in MLS, after the Miami Fusion was disbanded, he never reached his maximum potential in the league, electing to play in various leagues throughout South America, contributing to his advancement as a well-rounded, professional veteran. In 2009, he returned to Florida, signing with Miami FC scoring a goal, and providing two assists, ensuring a victory in his homecoming game.

===USL/MISL (Indoor)===
Serna signed with Syracuse Silver Knights of the American Major Indoor Soccer League on October 11, 2011.
He made his debut in a 16–15 win over the Rochester Lancers (2010). He was released from the team January 6, 2012.

===NAL===
On May 5, 2014, at age 40, Serna signed with Miami Dade FC to play the 2014 season.

<doc id="1135060" wikidata="Q5247550" url="?curid=1135060" title="Death of Yasser Arafat">
<text>Yasser Arafat, who was the President of the Palestinian National Authority and Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, died unexpectedly on 11 November 2004, 75 years of age, after a short period of illness. The cause of his death has since been debated, and several different theories concerning it have been suggested. However, official investigations by French and Russian teams did not find evidence of foul play.

==History of illness==
Arafat&#x27;s illness began on 12 October 2004 with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Soon afterward, his general health deteriorated. Following visits by other doctors, including teams from Tunisia, Jordan, and Egypt, Arafat was taken to France on a French government jet, and was admitted to the Hôpital d&#x27;instruction des armées Percy in Clamart, a suburb of Paris, on 29 October 2004. On admission, he was experiencing diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and generalised abdominal pain, along with mild liver and kidney failure linked to disseminated intravascular coagulation. His condition deteriorated with acute renal failure, and, on 3 November, he lapsed into a gradually deepening coma.

A controversy erupted between officials of the PNA and Suha Arafat when officials from the PNA traveled to France to see Yasser Arafat. French law forbids physicians from discussing the condition of their patients with anybody, with the exception, in the case of a grave prognosis, of close relatives. Accordingly, all communications concerning Arafat&#x27;s health had to be authorized by his wife. Palestinian officials expressed regret that the news about Yasser Arafat was &quot;filtered&quot; by her.

The next day, chief surgeon Christian Estripeau of Percy reported that Arafat&#x27;s condition had worsened, and that he had fallen into a deeper coma. Sheikh Taissir Tamimi, the head of the Islamic court of the Palestinian territories, who held a vigil at Arafat&#x27;s bedside, visited Arafat, and declared that it was out of the question to disconnect him from life support, since, according to him, such an action is prohibited in Islam.

== Death ==

Arafat was pronounced dead on 11 November 2004 at 03:30 UTC at the age of 75 of what French doctors called a massive haemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident. However, the underlying infection was declared unknown. The official statement announcing his death failed to determine a cause, saying only that he had a &quot;mystery blood disorder&quot;.

The &quot;Canard Enchaîné&quot; newspaper reported alleged leaks of information by unnamed medical sources at Percy hospital that had access to Arafat and his medical file. According to the newspaper, the doctors at Percy hospital suspected, from Arafat&#x27;s arrival, grave lesions of the liver responsible for an alteration of the composition of the blood; Arafat was therefore placed in a hematology service. Leukemia was &quot;soundly ruled out&quot;. According to the same source, the reason why this diagnosis of cirrhosis could not be made available was that, in the mind of the general public, cirrhosis is generally associated with the consequences of alcohol abuse. Even though the diagnosis was not of alcoholic cirrhosis and Arafat was not known for consuming any alcohol, there was a likelihood of rumors. The source explained that Arafat&#x27;s living conditions did little to improve the situation. Thus, according to the source, the probable causes of the disease were multiple; Arafat&#x27;s coma was a consequence of the worsened cirrhosis. The French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; quoted doctors as saying that he had &quot;an unusual blood disease and a liver problem&quot;.

After Arafat&#x27;s death, the French Ministry of Defence said that Arafat&#x27;s medical file would be transmitted to only his next of kin. It was determined that Arafat&#x27;s nephew and PNA envoy to the UN, Nasser al-Qudwa, was a close enough relative, thus working around Suha Arafat&#x27;s silence on her husband&#x27;s illness. Nasser al-Qudwa was given a copy of Arafat&#x27;s 558-page medical file by the French Ministry of Defence.

==Theories about the cause of death==

There are numerous theories about the cause of Arafat&#x27;s death. Initially Arafat&#x27;s records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials. In 2004, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath said after talks with Arafat&#x27;s French doctors that they had &quot;ruled out poison completely&quot;. However, Shaath stated in &quot;The Price of Kings&quot;, a documentary on Arafat&#x27;s leadership, &quot;I have no doubt that he was assassinated. The French said that whatever toxic material was in his body did not test positive in their toxicology table, saying in plain words &#x27;this was a poison we did not have in our laboratories.&#x27;&quot;

Al-Kurdi, Arafat&#x27;s personal physician for 18 years, said &quot;I would usually be summoned to attend to Arafat immediately, even when all he had was a simple cold ... But when his medical situation was really deteriorating, they chose not to call me at all&quot;, and Arafat&#x27;s wife, Suha, refused to allow him to visit Arafat in the private Paris hospital where he was being treated. Later he was denied access to Arafat&#x27;s body after his death.

Al-Kurdi also lamented that Arafat&#x27;s widow Suha had refused an autopsy, which he said would have answered many questions regarding cause of death.

Medical records released in 2005 showed that Arafat&#x27;s doctors could not agree on the cause of death, stating that he died from a stroke that stemmed from an unknown condition. Analysis based on those records suggested him dying from poisoning, AIDS, or an infection. In 2012, newly released medical records revealed that French doctors initially diagnosed Arafat with gastroenteritis.

===Poisoning===
In 2004, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath said after talks with Arafat&#x27;s French doctors that they had &quot;ruled out poison completely&quot;. A 2005 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that based on his records it was highly unlikely that Arafat died from poisoning. Meanwhile, al-Kurdi called for the creation of an independent commission to carry out investigations concerning Arafat&#x27;s suspicious death, stating, &quot;any doctor would tell you that these are the symptoms of a poisoning&quot;.

Former Knesset member, peace activist and personal friend of Arafat Uri Avnery claimed at the time of Arafat&#x27;s death that he had been poisoned, and repeated the claim in 2012. Another &quot;senior Israeli physician&quot; claimed in an article in &quot;Haaretz&quot; that it was &quot;a classic case of food poisoning&quot;, probably caused by a meal eaten four hours before he fell ill that may have contained a toxin such as ricin, rather than a standard bacterial poisoning. However, in the same week as the report in &quot;Haaretz&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a separate report, also based on access to Arafat&#x27;s medical records, which claimed that it was highly unlikely that Arafat had food poisoning.

====Poisoning with polonium====
According to Israel Radio, a former Palestinian intelligence officer, attorney Fahmi Shabana, said that Yasser Arafat&#x27;s political rivals were responsible for his death, and that he was poisoned with polonium. Shabana, who took part in the investigation into Arafat&#x27;s death in a French hospital in 2004, also said that several months after his death, the same cell murdered the head of military intelligence in Gaza, General Moussa Arafat, a relative of the PLO leader, in order to prevent a blood feud. The lawyer called on Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas to reopen the investigation into Arafat&#x27;s death.&quot;

On &quot;Newsnight&quot; on UK TV on 21 January 2016, during a feature on the 2006 assassination of Alexander Litvinienko, George Galloway claimed to have been with Yasser Arafat in Paris when he died of polonium-210 poisoning.

====Al Jazeera&#x27;s investigation====
On 4 July 2012, Al Jazeera reported that a nine-month investigation by Al Jazeera had revealed that none of the causes of Arafat&#x27;s death suggested in several rumors were true, as Arafat was in good health until he suddenly fell ill on 12 October 2004. Tests carried out by the &quot;Institut de Radiophysique&quot; (Institute of Radiation Physics) at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland found traces of polonium, a rare, highly radioactive element, on Arafat&#x27;s personal belongings, including his toothbrush, hat, surgical bouffant (headgear), and underwear, which suggested that there was a high level of polonium inside his body when he died. The investigation ruled out HIV or any other infectious disease as a cause of death. The polonium was found in quantities much higher than could occur naturally, and further, that 60%–80% of that polonium (depending on the item being tested) had not come from natural sources, but from a nuclear reactor. The quantities found on his personal items at the time of this investigation were generally consistent with quantities of polonium that would have been given to poison him when he suddenly first came down with major symptoms of illness.

In October 2010, an official press release from the Institut de Radiophysique, where those items were analyzed, had stated that:
In July 2012, a spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique stressed that the &quot;clinical symptoms described in Arafat&#x27;s medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not&quot;, and that &quot;the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat&#x27;s body to test it for polonium-210&quot;. François Bochud, who heads the Institute of Radiation Physics in Lausanne, Switzerland, stated that &quot;our results are clearly not a proof of any poisoning&quot;. Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds in England, stated: &quot;You don&#x27;t know much about the provenance of the clothing and whether it had been tampered with later on. You&#x27;d want to test the body.&quot;

In response to Al Jazeera&#x27;s report, Dr Ely Karmon, at Herzliya&#x27;s Institute for Counterterrorism, a specialist in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism, said that &quot;the half-life of the substance [i.e., slightly more than 138 days 9 hours] would make it impossible for polonium to have been discovered at such high levels if it had been used to kill Arafat eight years ago. If it had been used for poisoning, minimal levels should be seen now. Yet much higher levels were found. Someone planted the polonium much later.&quot; He went on to question why Arafat&#x27;s widow, Suha Arafat, who provided the researchers with Arafat&#x27;s belongings was not also poisoned while she was by his side at the hospital touching him and his clothing.

Israel has denied any connection to the rumours. Deputy Spokesman of Israeli Foreign Ministry Paul Hirschson was skeptical of the rumours, joking, &quot;All of a sudden, Suha&#x27;s checking her wash basket and discovered clothes that weren&#x27;t washed for eight years. Suddenly, out of nowhere a couple of garments turn up; we test them, and presto! There&#x27;s Polonium.&quot; Avi Dichter, who was in charge of the Shin Bet when Arafat died, told Army radio that &quot;Yasser Arafat had many enemies, domestically, abroad. But let them investigate. ... The Palestinians know well how to investigate what goes on in their house. Let them investigate and find out.&quot;

On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a peer-reviewed article titled &quot;Improving forensic investigation for polonium poisoning&quot;. In the article, a group of Swiss doctors suggested that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning. The team analysed 38 samples of Arafat&#x27;s clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free. Several of the Arafat samples were notably more radioactive than the controls, but not all. The team believed that an autopsy could be useful in this case. After testing Arafat&#x27;s personal belongings and samples of his body fluids, the chief of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency of Russia, Vladimir Uyba, concluded that polonium was not the cause of his death, but the Agency then denied that Uyba&#x27;s comments were official. British forensic scientist Professor David Barclay said the Swiss team&#x27;s findings were a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, and that it was &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that polonium had been the cause of his death. After the results of the French and Russian tests became public, David Barclay did not comment or communicate any more on the case.

The French tests found some polonium but stated it was from &quot;natural environmental origin&quot;. Later the Russian tests released in December 2013 found that Arafat&#x27;s death was not caused by radiation. Vladimir Uyba, the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated that Yasser had died of natural causes and they had no plans to conduct further tests.

===Gastroenteritis===
New medical records that were released in July 2012 showed that Arafat&#x27;s condition was initially diagnosed as viral gastroenteritis by his Arab doctors who took care of him in the West Bank in the Mukataa before he was airlifted to France, although his condition later improved and he even joined in the fast of Ramadan. However, there was persistent vomiting and diarrhea, Arafat began feeling weaker, and his blood platelet count dropped. On 28 October, his medical team decided to send him abroad, and he was flown to France the next morning.

Dr Joseph Zimmerman, an Israeli specialist who reviewed the Ramallah medical file said Arafat&#x27;s early symptoms were not consistent with viral gastroenteritis, and did not believe that type of viral infection would lead to death. He also said that poisoning appeared unlikely, even by a radioactive substance such as polonium-210. He reminded people that Arafat&#x27;s platelet counts dropped suddenly and stayed low, and that Arafat eventually exhibited signs of liver dysfunction, which could have been caused by a bacterial infection, but is not typical of poisoning.

===Platelet disorder===
A report by the French doctors who treated him states that a platelet disorder caused Arafat&#x27;s death. The cause of this platelet disorder is unknown, although poison is a possibility.

===AIDS===
In September 2005, based on obtained Arafat records, an Israeli AIDS expert claimed that Arafat bore all the symptoms of AIDS, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed it was highly unlikely that Arafat died from AIDS. John Loftus reported on ABC radio that Arafat had died of AIDS. According to Loftus, the CIA had knowledge of his condition, and convinced Israel not to assassinate him and wait for his inevitable death of the disease, since the subsequent widespread connotations of the disease with homosexuality would discredit him. Arafat&#x27;s personal doctor for 18 years, Dr. Ashraf Al-Kurdi, said there was HIV in his blood, but poison killed him, and al-Kurdi, a former Jordanian official said the virus had been injected into Arafat&#x27;s bloodstream.

However an article published in a number of American news publications rejected the assertion that Arafat had AIDS, stating, &quot;An Israeli infectious disease specialist said he would have performed the test, if only to be thorough and to refute the rumors that surrounded the case. He said news accounts during Arafat&#x27;s illness made him strongly suspect that Arafat had AIDS. But after studying the records, he said that was improbable, given the sudden onset of the intestinal troubles&quot;, though AIDS-associated opportunistic infections such as cryptosporidiosis can begin in this way. This same article also states that it is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that Arafat had died from poisoning, and further asserts that Arafat had died from a stroke linked to an &quot;underlying infection.&quot;

==== Call for new investigation ====
Following Al Jazeera&#x27;s investigation, Suha Arafat, Arafat&#x27;s widow, called for the exhumation of Arafat&#x27;s body for further testing. In response, Abbas ordered a committee to be formed, and stated that there were no religious or political obstacles to exhuming the body. However, Nimr Hamad, an aide to Abbas, stated that a team of experts would first be sent to Europe to learn more from the Swiss institute and from the French military hospital where Arafat died. Abbas stated that he would only order an autopsy if the family agreed, but did not define whom in the family he meant. Later, Abbas stated that they would only investigate &quot;if necessary&quot;. Tawfiq Tirawi, the head of the committee in charge of investigating Arafat&#x27;s death, stated: &quot;We are certain that there are Palestinian hands that contributed to the elimination of Yasser Arafat.&quot; With regards to those people, Tirawi stated that they &quot;will be subject to severe penalties and doomed to death&quot;. On 30 July 2012, Tirawi added, &quot;We haven&#x27;t initiated the investigation based on the hypothesis that Arafat was killed by poison, but we agreed to begin an investigation searching directly for the killer regardless of the medical reports which will eventually show the method of killing and name of the toxin.&quot;

Tunisia also requested that the Arab League convene a ministerial meeting to discuss Arafat&#x27;s death and study the circumstances in which he died.

Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby stated that a permanent representative meeting would be held to discuss Arafat&#x27;s death, and that permanent representatives would prepare a report and raise proposals over necessary action, which they would present in the soonest Arab League ministerial meeting.

===Killed by his wife===
At the end of a 2024 interview with ex-Shin Bet agent and Hamas insider Mosab Hassan Yousef, Yousef said that Arafat&#x27;s wife unplugged him from life support, to steal the USD9 billion Arafat had amassed.

==Exhumation of Arafat&#x27;s remains==
On 9 July 2012, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas approved the exhumation of Arafat&#x27;s body in response to the Al Jazeera story about polonium. On 8 August 2012, Swiss experts were invited to the West Bank to prepare for the examination of Yasser Arafat&#x27;s remains to investigate possible poisoning. The lab said that they wanted guarantees that the investigation would not be used for political purposes, saying, &quot;Meanwhile, our main concern is to guarantee the independence, the credibility and the transparency of any involvement that we may have.&quot; On 27 November 2012, three teams of international investigators collected samples from Arafat&#x27;s body and the surrounding soil in the mausoleum in Ramallah. A French, a Swiss and a Russian team independently investigated the samples.

Publication of the results of the studies was delayed, reportedly on the request of the Palestinian Authority, which feared they could have negative impact on the peace talks.

On 6 November 2013, Al Jazeera reported that the Swiss forensic team had found levels of polonium in Arafat&#x27;s ribs and pelvis 18 times higher than normal, and were 83% confident that polonium poisoning had occurred, but Professor Bochud disagreed with this interpretation by Al Jazeera and only stated that the poisoning hypothesis by polonium was &quot;moderately supported&quot;.

According to a journalist from the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps, Luis Lema, the Swiss experts had concluded that on a probability scale ranging from one to six, death by polonium poisoning was around five.

Arafat&#x27;s widow Suha stated her belief that he was a victim of a &quot;political assassination&quot; but refrained from finger-pointing and said she would await the French forensic results.

&quot;Joods Actueel&quot;, a Belgian monthly newspaper, claimed that most experts in forensics disagreed that the results were consistent with polonium poisoning and that the conclusions of the Swiss study were not in line with the results obtained.

Forensic biologist Nathan Lents of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice said the report&#x27;s results were consistent with a possible polonium poisoning, but &quot;There&#x27;s certainly not a smoking gun here.&quot;

Derek Hill, a professor in radiological science at University College London who was not involved in the investigation, said: &quot;I would say it&#x27;s clearly not overwhelming proof, and there is a risk of contamination (of the samples), but it is a pretty strong signal. ... It seems likely what they&#x27;re doing is putting a very cautious interpretation of strong data.&quot;

After the testing of Arafat&#x27;s remains by the Russian team, the Russian Medical-Biological Agency concluded that polonium was not the cause of his death. However, the government scientific body later denied that it had made any official statement about the research, saying only that it had handed its results to the Russian Foreign Ministry. However, Al Jazeera found that the Russian scientists had only investigated four out of 20 samples, being the samples that were unlikely to show the amount of radioactive exposure. The scientists also appear to have been restricted by the Russian Foreign Ministry in how to present the report. According to Al Jazeera&#x27;s source, &quot;Russia&#x27;s goal was to fulfill the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s request, not offend Israel by helping the PA, and not create a new hotbed in the Middle East&quot;.

In December 2013, an unidentified person leaked what were claimed to be the results of the French investigation to AFP, saying that &quot;the report rules out the poisoning theory and goes in the sense of a natural death&quot;. According to the leaker, the report says Arafat died of a &quot;generalised infection&quot;. On 4 December, Al Jazeera quoted Suha Arafat speaking at a press conference after having received the French report: &quot;Is it the poisoned body that would have contaminated the environment outside? Or is it the opposite? The first one is the conclusion of the Swiss. The Swiss think that the body was poisoned and contaminated the environment. And the French reach the opposite conclusion—that it&#x27;s actually the environment outside which explains the presence of polonium 210.&quot; Later that same month, a Russian investigative team from the Federal Medico-Biological Agency agreed that Arafat did not die from poisoning.

Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The French later announced that foul play was not involved.

The CHUV published in February 2016 a paper in Science Direct to justify their conclusions. They said: &quot;The evidences gathered during this expert report are not clear-cut: we cannot exclude 210Po as a cause of death, but we cannot be sure that 210Po was the cause of death.&quot;

In another document the CHUV explains &quot;...these results do not then define the probability to which Yasser Arafat would have been poisoned by polonium, but must be integrated into the larger context of the police and legal investigations in connection to this case, and which are beyond our field of expertise&quot;.

In July 2016, Joods Actueel published an updated document wherein it stated that their previous analysis was confirmed by CHUV. According to them, the conclusions that are based only on Bayesian analysis are not valid as they are not documented with figures. It also invoked errors based on such examples as the investigation into the case of Sally Clark.

==Murder inquiry==
After Al Jazeera&#x27;s presentation in July 2012 of the results of its nine-month investigation, Arafat&#x27;s widow Suha Arafat declared her intention to launch a court case in France into the death of her husband. Suha Arafat told Al Jazeera that she had long suspected that her husband was murdered, noting that both Israel and the United States regarded him as an obstacle to peace.

On 31 July 2012, Suha Arafat and her daughter Zahwa lodged a murder complaint in the Paris western suburb of Nanterre. On 28 August, French prosecutors opened a murder inquiry. In March 2015, a French prosecutor announced that Arafat&#x27;s death was from natural causes, and found that the polonium 210 and lead 210 discovered in Arafat&#x27;s grave were of an environmental nature.

Later, a French investigation by three judges unanimously concluded that &quot;it has not been demonstrated that Mr Yasser Arafat was murdered by polonium-210 poisoning&quot; and that the investigation should be dropped.

At the end of June 2016, a French Court of Appeal confirmed the previous conclusions.

==Allegation of killing of Arafat by Israel==
The Israeli government tried for decades to assassinate Arafat, including attempting to intercept and shoot down private aircraft and commercial airliners on which he was believed to be traveling. The assassination was initially assigned to Caesarea, the Mossad unit in charge of Israel&#x27;s targeted killings. Shooting down a commercial airliner in international airspace over very deep water was thought to be preferable to make recovery of the wreckage, and hence investigation, more difficult. Following Israel&#x27;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Israeli Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon created a special task force code named &quot;Salt Fish&quot; headed by special operations experts Meir Dagan and Rafi Eitan to track Arafat&#x27;s movements in Lebanon to kill him because Sharon still saw Arafat as an important symbol. The Salt Fish task force orchestrated the bombing of buildings where Arafat and senior PLO leaders were believed to be staying. Later renamed &quot;Operation Goldfish&quot;, Israeli operatives followed Israeli journalist Uri Avnery to a meeting with Arafat in an additional unsuccessful attempt to eliminate him. In 2001, Sharon, as prime minister, is believed to have made a commitment to cease attempts to assassinate Arafat. However, following Israel&#x27;s successful assassination in March 2004 of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a founder of the Hamas movement, in April 2004 Sharon stated that &quot;this commitment of mine no longer exists.&quot;

On September 11, 2003, the Security Cabinet of Israel decided that &quot;Israel will act to remove this obstacle [Arafat] in the manner, at the time, and in the ways that will be decided on separately&quot;. Israeli Cabinet members and officials hinted on Arafat&#x27;s death.

Journalist Danny Rubinstein states that Ariel Sharon&#x27;s inner circle constantly discussed how to get rid of Arafat months and weeks before his death. Israeli peace activist and former Knesset member, Uri Avnery, a personal friend of Arafat, blamed Sharon for Arafat&#x27;s death. Palestinian official and nephew of Arafat Nasser al-Qudwa said that the report of the committee that investigated the death of late Palestinian President Yasser Arafat revealed that the leader was poisoned to death, and that Israel is directly responsible for his assassination. He said &quot;Israel as a state, is a country that has access to Polonium, had the capability to assassinate the late leader, and expressed clear interest in getting rid of him&quot;.

On 11 September 2003, the Israeli security Cabinet decided to &quot;remove&quot; Arafat. In a statement it said &quot;Recent days&#x27; events have proven again that Yasser Arafat is a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation... Israel will act to remove this obstacle in the manner, at the time, and in the ways that will be decided on separately...&quot; Prime Minister Ariel Sharon refused to give a timetable for his removal, because &quot;It depends on what happens on the ground,&quot;. Sharon said: &quot;Arafat is responsible for the killing of hundreds, if not thousands, of Jews...The sword is hanging over his head, and this is a good thing.&quot; Chief of Staff Moshe Ya&#x27;alon and other Israeli officials declared that the Palestinian leader should &quot;either be killed or deported&quot;. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that Arafat impeded and undermined the peace process and urged states of the European Union to boycott Arafat. Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told Israel Radio that killing Arafat &quot;is definitely one of the options&quot; under consideration by the government. A Security Council resolution demanding that Israel desist from deporting Arafat or threatening his safety was vetoed by the United States.

In 2009, Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat&#x27;s former advisor, alleged that Mossad, the national intelligence agency of Israel, had poisoned Arafat by a lethal dose of thallium, a rare chemical whose effects are difficult to trace, via Arafat&#x27;s daily medications. Abu Sharif alleged that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had held the driver of a Palestinian ambulance that brought him his medications, for a minimum of 30 minutes while the IDF searched it. According to Abu Sharif, this incident would have allowed Israel to replace Arafat&#x27;s medications with poison. In his book &quot;Arafat and the Dream of Palestine: An Insider&#x27;s Account&quot;, Abu Sharif wrote, &quot;I was positive they were poisoning his food on a daily basis and doing it right under our very eyes.&quot;

As a result of Abu Sharif&#x27;s allegations, the delegates at the August 2009 Fatah convention in Bethlehem voted for a resolution which blamed Israel for poisoning Yasser Arafat. An editorial in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; questioned the legitimacy of Abu Sharif&#x27;s allegations, noting that &quot;nobody asked how Abu Sharif came to possess this information, whether he can back it up or why he chose to divulge it so late&quot;. A leader of Fatah and a nephew of Arafat said that an investigation indicated a &quot;high possibility of poisoning&quot; but that there was not any proof.

In 2011, Abu Sarif alleged that an investigation conducted by &quot;the most prominent forensic toxicology expert in the UK&quot; had revealed that thallium was responsible for poisoning Arafat. According to Abu Sharif, European toxicology experts are not familiar with thallium and only this forensic toxicology expert could have identified the thallium. However, Abu Sharif did not reveal the names of the expert or the institution responsible for the research.

Israeli officials denied in 2012 any connection with the recent finds. Israeli journalist Yossi Melman, who specializes in espionage stories, reported that, based on his research with Dan Raviv, Israel did not kill Arafat. Melman stated that the IDF had wanted to take harsh action against Arafat, ranging from killing him to expelling him, but Prime Minister Sharon rejected these ideas, stating that the advantages would not outweigh being accused of killing Arafat, and Arafat already seemed to be an irrelevant leader who was not trusted by the international community.

<doc id="1135065" wikidata="Q494625" url="?curid=1135065" title="Usan">
<text>Usan-guk, or the State of Usan, occupied Ulleung-do and the adjacent islands during the Korean Three Kingdoms period. According to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, it was conquered by the Silla general Kim Isabu in 512. He is said to have used wooden lions or tigers to intimidate the residents into surrendering. It has been written that the alias of Usan-guk is Ulleung-do. Usan-guk rarely entered into historical records, but appears to have continued a largely autonomous existence until its loss of independence to Goryeo in 930.

==History==
===Historical records===
Earliest records that appear in the Records of the Three Kingdoms indirectly attest the existence of the kingdom, which says &quot;When Wang Qi(王頎) (of Cao Wei) has come to Okjeo to conquer gung (Dongcheon of Goguryeo), he asked a local man whether there are people living in the east sea, and the man replied there are people living in an island that exists in the eastern seas, and they select a girl to put in the ocean every July.&quot;

In Samguk Sagi, it is said that because of general Isabu&#x27;s threats with wooden lions, Usan chose to be a vassal state to Silla in 512.

In Goryeosa, it is recorded that Usan requested to be submitted under the rule of Goryeo in 930 by sending Baekgil and Todu. In 1018, when Usan was severely affected by Jurchen invasions, the Goryeo king sent Lee Won Gu with farming equipment, and asked the locals of Usan who have fled from those invasions to return to their lands. Usan was finally abolished and fully incorporated in 1022 as all of the refugees from Usan were settled to the region of Yeju.

<text>A mythical number is a number used and accepted as deriving from scientific investigation and/or careful selection, but whose origin is unknown and whose basis is unsubstantiated. An example is the number 48 billion, which has often been accepted as the number of dollars per year of identity theft. This number &quot;has appeared in hundreds of news stories, including a New York Times piece&quot; despite the fact that it has been shown repeatedly to be highly inaccurate. The term was coined in 1971 by Max Singer, one of the founders of the Hudson Institute.

The origins of such numbers are akin to those of urban legends and may include (among others):
* misinterpretation of examples 
* extrapolation from apparently similar fields
* especially successful pranks 
* comical results
* guess-estimates by public officials 
* deliberate misinformation

<doc id="1135075" wikidata="Q2738348" url="?curid=1135075" title="Creation and evolution in public education">
<text>The status of creation and evolution in public education has been the subject of substantial debate and conflict in legal, political, and religious circles. Globally, there are a wide variety of views on the topic. Most western countries have legislation that mandates only evolutionary biology is to be taught in the appropriate scientific syllabuses.

==Overview==
While many Christian denominations do not raise theological objections to the modern evolutionary synthesis as an explanation for the present forms of life on planet Earth, various socially conservative, traditionalist, and fundamentalist religious sects and political groups within Christianity and Islam have objected vehemently to the study and teaching of biological evolution. Some adherents of these Christian and Islamic religious sects or political groups are passionately opposed to the consensus view of the scientific community. Literal interpretations of religious texts are the greatest cause of conflict with evolutionary and cosmological investigations and conclusions.

Internationally, biological evolution is taught in science courses with limited controversy, with the exception of a few areas of the United States and several Muslim-majority countries, primarily Turkey. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled the teaching of creationism as science in public schools to be unconstitutional, irrespective of how it may be purveyed in theological or religious instruction. In the United States, intelligent design (ID) has been represented as an alternative explanation to evolution in recent decades, but its &quot;demonstrably religious, cultural, and legal missions&quot; have been ruled unconstitutional by a lower court.

==By country==

===Australia===
Although creationist views are popular among religious education teachers and creationist teaching materials have been distributed by volunteers in some schools in Australia, many Australian scientists take an aggressive stance supporting the right of teachers to teach the theory of evolution, unhindered by religious restrictions.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, teaching of creationism in scientific education classes is forbidden by the Ministry of Education (MEC). Religious education is not forbidden as such, but the federal constitution states that the union can neither impose, nor promote, nor finance any religion, because by law Brazil is a secular state. In 2004 however, teachers of religious education classes in schools of the education department of Rio de Janeiro began to present creationism in their classes as scientific fact. The practice was directly initiated by politicians in power who were promoting their personal religious views, and their action moved Brazilian scientists to protest the abuse. Subsequently, in congress a &quot;religious bench,&quot; or faction, has become increasingly influential. For example, a Brazilian senator, Marcelo Crivella, the former Minister of Fishing and Aquaculture, publicly declared his religiously founded antagonism to evolution. Such prominent influences have drawn the attention of the defenders of the secular state.

===China===
Evolutionary theory is part of the public education in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. As private religious schools are rare, nearly all students receiving primary and secondary education in Mainland China receive education that includes evolutionary theory. However, one study has identified limitations with the textbooks used in Mainland China, including the absence of topics covered in other countries such as the USSR and the USA.

===Council of Europe===
On October 4, 2007, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted its Resolution 1580 titled &quot;The dangers of creationism in education&quot;. The resolution observed that &quot;The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism closely linked to extreme right-wing political movements,&quot; and urged member states &quot;firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general the presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion.&quot;

===Denmark===
On April 25, 2007, Member of Parliament Martin Henriksen (Danish People&#x27;s Party) asked Education Minister Bertel Haarder (Liberal Party of Denmark) for information about how many educational institutions had received &quot;The Atlas of Creation&quot; (2006) by Harun Yahya. The minister responded that the Ministry of Education was not in possession of information about the number of educational institutions that had received the book. Further, he stated that the choice of educational materials is decided by local school boards. Moreover, it is his view that the end goal of primary school biology instruction is to enable students to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to explain the basic elements of heredity and evolution and to address the issues related to the biological coursework.

In interview sessions during 2002, less than 10% of the interviewed Danes declared the theory of evolution as being definitely false.

=== Hungary ===
Evolution was accepted by the Hungarian education system soon after Darwin wrote about it.

=== India ===
From April 2023, content on evolution was removed from science textbooks. According to India&#x27;s National Council for Education, Research and Training (NCERT), this decision was made to lighten students&#x27; workload following the Covid-19 pandemic. In the broader sociopolitical context, some Hindu-nationalist politicians had recently been expressing skepticism about evolution, despite a longer history of compatibility between Hindu views and the theory of evolution. Many scientists and educators were critical of the deletion of evolution-related material from textbooks.

===Iran===
Iranian scientific development, especially the health-related aspects of biology, has been a goal of the Islamic government since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Since Iranian traditional practice of Shi&#x27;a religion isn&#x27;t preoccupied with Qur&#x27;anic literalism as in case of fundamentalist Wahhabism but ijtihad, many influential Iranian Shi&#x27;ite scholars, including several who were closely involved in the Iranian Revolution, are not opposed to evolutionary ideas in general, disagreeing that evolution necessarily conflicts with the Muslim mainstream. Evolution is incorporated in the science curriculum starting from the 5th grade. An emphasis is placed on empirical evidence, such as the study of fossils, rather than Islamic scripture, thus portraying geologists and other types of scientists as the authoritative voices of scientific knowledge.

===Israel===
In Israel, compulsory education is separate for secular Jews, ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs. In the ultra-Orthodox education system, theory of evolution is not being taught. It has been taught regularly in the secular education system. However, following the rise of religious right-wing parties, evolution has been gradually removed from the school curriculum.

===Japan===
The theory of evolution is taught in Japan as part of the education policy. The teaching of evolution began already under the Japanese Empire, and the first academic lecture on evolution was given at Tokyo Imperial University by American biology expert Edward Morse on September 12, 1877.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands some factions teach creationism in their own schools, besides evolution. In May 2005, a discussion on intelligent design erupted when Minister of Education Maria van der Hoeven suggested that debate about intelligent design might encourage discourse between the country&#x27;s various religious groups. She sought to &quot;stimulate an academic debate&quot; on the subject. Following strong objection from some scientists, she dropped plans of holding a conference on the matter.
After the 2007 elections, she was succeeded by Ronald Plasterk, described as a &quot;molecular geneticist, staunch atheist and opponent of intelligent design.&quot;

===Norway===
In 1986, Norway&#x27;s then-Minister of Church and Education Affairs Kjell Magne Bondevik proposed new education plans for the elementary and middle school levels which included skepticism of the theory of evolution and would hold that a final answer to the origin of mankind was unknown. The proposal was withdrawn after it had generated controversy.

===Pakistan===
Although it has been claimed that evolution is not taught in Pakistani universities; the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, which is the federal body which sets standards of course content, has knowledge and understanding of evolution as being compulsory for several courses such as microbiology, bioinformatics, zoology, botany as well as others. In 2006, the Pakistan Academy of Sciences became a signatory of the InterAcademy Panel Statement on &quot;The teaching of evolution.&quot; Many of the contemporary titles on the creation–evolution controversy, such as those by biologist Richard Dawkins, are available for general sale.

===Poland===
Poland saw a controversy over creationism in 2006 when Deputy Education Minister Mirosław Orzechowski denounced evolution as a lie taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of National Education Roman Giertych, has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, &quot;as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory.&quot; Giertych&#x27;s father, Member of the European Parliament Maciej Giertych, has however opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that &quot;in every culture there are indications that we remember dinosaurs. The Scots have Nessie; we Poles have the Wawel dragon.&quot;

===Romania===
In 1998, Ioan Moisin, a Christian Democratic senator and a Greek Catholic priest, called upon Romania&#x27;s Ministry of Education to establish a commission of Catholics who would revise biology textbooks and philosophical textbooks to not contradict Biblical creationism. Moisin disapproved of students learning from their religious teachers that God created human beings and then learning the contrary from biology and philosophy teachers that humans and apes descend from a common ancestor as a product of evolution by Darwinian natural selection. Moisin&#x27;s proposal to establish the commission also sought to form a Council of Public Morality that would feature representatives composed of teachers and clergy, to oversee public education, and to be subordinated only to the direct authority of the President of Romania. Romania&#x27;s Parliament and Ministry of Education never seriously considered the latter proposals. However, starting the year 2006 and ongoing Darwinian evolution was discontinued from newly printed school books throughout the country without being reintroduced.

===Russia===
In December 2006, a schoolgirl in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and her father took the issue of the teaching of evolution in Russian schools to court. The Russian Ministry of Education supports the theory of evolution. Representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church backed the suit. In February 2007, the first instance court, and in July, the second instance court, ruled in favour of the Ministry.

In August 2014 the Mayor of Kazan, Il&#x27;sur Metshin, expressed surprise at schools teaching the &quot;theory of Darwin&quot;.
He added that he intended to raise the question of the school curriculum at the federal level.

===Saudi Arabia===
As a religious state, Saudi Arabia has denied the theory of evolution in their science education. Science textbooks approved by the Saudi Ministry of Education have associated Darwin with Western philosophy which they reject and perceive to be &quot;problematic&quot;. Saudi&#x27;s denial of evolution originated from the lack of secularization in the nation, the continuing development of its education system, and its homogenic religious population. King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, the only co-ed university in the state, received criticism for its co-ed establishment and was called for further scrutiny in its science curriculum. Sheikh Saad al-Shithri, a religious scholar, stated that &quot;&quot;the recommendation is to set up sharia committees at this university to oversee these studies and look into what violates the sharia (Islamic law)&quot;.&quot; He further states, &quot;We are looking at some of the sciences that have included some irregular and alien ideologies, like evolution and such other ideologies&quot;&quot;.&quot;

According to a poll by Reuters News, Saudi Arabia was ranked the highest in the list of countries that favor creationist views. As an Islamist state, Saudi education policies are centered around an Islamic worldview. This is referenced in various science textbooks, such a 6th grade textbook teaching divine creation by citing a Quran verse that states &quot;we have indeed created man with the best of moulds&quot;. A 10th grade textbook includes a glossary of biological terms with religious explanation, such as the term adaptation being defined as &quot;Allah, glory to him, created for organisms those characteristics and structures that enable them to live in their different environments&quot;.

A Saudi 12th-grade textbook mentions evolution by name only where it claims that Charles Darwin has &quot;denied Allah&#x27;s creation of humanity&quot;. The rest of the textbook focuses on descriptions of the taxonomic ranks: it makes no further mention of evolution, only quoting Qur&#x27;an verses as relevant to certain groups of animals.

===Serbia===
In Serbia the teaching of evolution was suspended for one week in 2004, under Minister of Education and Sport Ljiljana Čolić, only allowing schools to reintroduce evolution into the curriculum if they also taught creationism. &quot;After a deluge of protest from scientists, teachers and opposition parties&quot; says the BBC report, Čolić&#x27;s deputy, Milan Brdar, made the statement, &quot;I have come here to confirm Charles Darwin is still alive&quot; and announced that the decision was reversed. Čolić resigned after the government said that she had caused &quot;problems that had started to reflect on the work of the entire government.&quot;

===South Korea===
The theory of evolution is part of the educational curriculum in public schools in South Korea. However, in 2012, South Korean Ministry of Education ordered to remove references to this theory from some high school textbooks.

===Turkey===
In Turkey, a country where the majority of population is Muslim, evolution is often a controversial subject. Evolution was added to the school curriculum shortly after the Turkish Revolution of the 1920s and 30s. There was some resistance to this, such as that of Said Nursî and his followers, but opposition was not particularly powerful. In fact, some prominent Turkish scholars during the first decades of the new-born Turkish republic, such as Ahmet Hamdi Akseki (d. 1951), who once served as the President of Religious Affairs of Turkey, and İzmirli İsmail Hakkı (d. 1946) thought that the theory of evolution cannot be seen as contrary to Islam because it was already to be found in the classical works of Muslim theology. In the 1980s, conservatives came into power, and used the ideas of scientific creationists in the US as a method of discrediting evolution (notwithstanding material on the age of the Earth, which Islamic creationism is less specific about).

One anti-evolutionist group in Turkey is the Istanbul based &quot;Bilim Araştırma Vakfı&quot; (BAV), or &quot;Science Research Foundation,&quot; which was founded by Adnan Oktar in 1990. Its activities include campaigns against the teaching of evolution. It has been described as one of the strongest anti-evolution organizations outside of North America. US based creationist organizations such as the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) have worked alongside them. Some scientists have protested that anti-evolution books published by this group (such as &quot;The Evolution Deceit&quot; (1999) by Harun Yahya) have become more influential than real biology textbooks. The teaching of evolution in high schools has been fought by Ali Gören, a member of parliament and professor of medicine, who believes such education has negative effects.

The situation is very fragile, and the status of evolution in education varies from one government to the next. For example, in 1985 the Minister of National Education, Youth and Sports Vehbi Dinçerler had scientific creationism added to high school texts, and also had the discredited Lamarckism presented alongside Darwinism. Only in 1998 was this changed somewhat, with texts presenting a more balanced view, though still mentioning creationism and Lamarckism. At present the moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party, which is sympathetic to creationist views, holds power. It was elected in 2002 and again with a greater majority in 2007.

In general, material that conflicts with religious beliefs is highly controversial in Turkey. For example, in November 2007 a prosecutor launched a probe into whether Richard Dawkins&#x27; book &quot;The God Delusion&quot; (2006) is &quot;an attack on religious values.&quot; If convicted, the Turkish publisher and translator, Erol Karaaslan, would have faced a prison sentence of inciting religious hatred and insulting religious values. In April 2008, the defendant was acquitted by a court and a judge ruled against banning the book due to the fact that it limited freedom of thought.

Turkish academics who have defended evolutionary theory have received death threats, for instance Turkish biologist Aykut Kence received an email telling him to enjoy his &quot;final days.&quot; Kence helped establish the Evolution Group, whose aim is to improve public understanding of evolution. However, opposition to creationism is not very powerful; Umit Sayin, a neurologist, describes academics and universities as &quot;slow and sluggish&quot; in their response. Kence maintains that &quot;if knowledgeable people keep quiet, it only helps those who spread nonsense.&quot;

In June 2017, the education ministry announced the removal of evolution from the secondary school curriculum, scheduled to take effect in 2019; as of the date of the announcement the only other Muslim majority country where evolution is challenged in the education system was Saudi Arabia, where the concept is briefly named and heavily criticized in the curricula.
===United Kingdom===

In each of the countries of the United Kingdom, there is an agreed syllabus for religious education with the right of parents to withdraw their children from these lessons. The religious education syllabus does not involve teaching creationism, but rather teaching the central tenets of major world faiths. At the same time, the teaching of evolution is compulsory in publicly funded schools. For instance, the National Curriculum for England requires that students at Key Stage 4 (14–16) be taught:
# that the fossil record is evidence for evolution
# how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction

Similar requirements exist in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

In 2003, the Emmanuel Schools Foundation (previously the Vardy Foundation after its founder, Sir Peter Vardy) sponsored a number of &quot;faith-based&quot; academies where evolution and creationist ideas would be taught side-by-side in science classes. This caused a considerable amount of controversy.

The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has expressed his view that creationism should not be taught in schools.

An organisation called Truth in Science has distributed teaching packs of creationist information to schools, and claims that fifty-nine schools are using the packs as &quot;a useful classroom resource.&quot; The government has stated that &quot;Neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories and they are not included in the science curriculum. The Truth in Science information pack is therefore not an appropriate resource to support the science curriculum.&quot; It is arranging to communicate this message directly to schools.

The teaching of creationism and intelligent design in schools in the UK is being opposed by the British Centre for Science Education (BCSE).

Some Democratic Unionist Party DUP politicians have called for creationism to be taught in schools.

===United States===

In the United States, creationists and proponents of evolution are engaged in a long-standing battle over the legal status of creation and evolution in the public school science classroom. The Edwards v. Aguillard ruling of the Supreme Court set a &quot;Lemon&quot; test that limits teaching of creationism in government run schools. However, as of 2014 at least 13 US states allow pro-creationist content to be taught either in charter schools or private schools that are at least partially supported by government funding. The 2022 Supreme Court ruling of Carson v. Makin necessitating that a school voucher program must not exclude religious private schools may prevent any state with a voucher program from preventing voucher money being provided to schools that teach creationism.

<doc id="1135081" wikidata="Q7535948" url="?curid=1135081" title="Skithouse">
<text>Skithouse (styled skitHOUSE) is an Australian sketch comedy television series that ran on Network Ten from 9 February 2003 to 28 July 2004. The series was produced by Roving Enterprises. It featured many well-known Australian comedians, including comedy-band Tripod. Reruns can now be seen on The Comedy Channel on Foxtel. In the UK, it is shown on the channel Paramount Comedy 2 and Trouble. The title name itself is a pun on the colloquialism &quot;shithouse&quot;.

The series only ran for two seasons, before being cancelled due to a combination of dwindling ratings and the withdrawal of the cable network Foxtel as co-financier of the program&#x27;s production.

== Cast ==
&quot;Skithouse&quot; was produced by Roving Enterprises, a production company formed by Rove McManus. Two key performers were Rove&#x27;s Rove Live co-hosts Peter Helliar and Corinne Grant. The show also featured Cal Wilson, Scott Brennan, Fiona Harris, Damian Callinan, Roz Hammond, Michael Chamberlin, Ingrid Bloom, Tom Gleeson, Jason Geary and Ben Anderson. Members of the comedic band Tripod also featured, not just as the band but in the actual skits as well. Tripod are Scod (Scott Edgar), Yon (Simon Hall) and Gatesy (Steven Gates).

The director was &quot;Full Frontal&quot; alumna, Daina Reid.

Since the cancellation of the series, a number of the stars have moved on to other areas in the comedy industry. Scott Brennan and Fiona Harris starred in &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; (before the show&#x27;s end) as well as Damian Callinan and Cal Wilson staying on Network Ten on &quot;The Wedge&quot; with Roz Hammond and Ben Anderson as part of the ensemble cast on &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;. Tom Gleeson has gone on to host popular ABCTV quiz show, &quot;Hard Quiz&quot; which he has been the host of since October 2016.

== The show ==
The show consisted of numerous comedic skits. The half-hour shows themselves often seemed to have themes (or at least they repeated the use of sets, costumes, characters and props). Its comedic styling was reminiscent of many classic Australian sketch comedies, like &quot;Full Frontal&quot; and &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, sharing common elements such as self-depreciating humour, low-cost props and effects. 

== Notable characters and sketches ==
Many characters recurred throughout the series, often appearing several times in a single episode, creating a semi-coherent storyline. Some more notable recurring characters and/or scenarios are listed below.

;The Australian Fast Bowler (Gleeson): A cricket fast bowler, loosely resembling Dennis Lillee, who uses his bowling skills to help people or defend against evil, superhero style.

;Bubble Wrap Man (Yon): Bubble Wrap Man is a send-up of traditional superheroes. His outfit consisted of a standard red superhero outfit, complete with underwear on the outside, and a bubble wrap cape. Bubble Wrap Man would appear in stressful situations for other unnamed characters, and say to them: &quot;Pop the bubbles on my cape!&quot; 

;The &quot;I&#x27;ll Snap Ya&quot; Guy (Callinan): A parody of an Australian &#x27;bogan&#x27; who continually narrates sketches in which he speaks of various people he has punched (or &#x27;snapped&#x27;). 

;Redheads (Gleeson, Wilson, Hammond, Yon): Stereotyped red-haired Caucasian people who have an extreme fear of sunlight. They seem incapable of natural speech, communicating in squeaks.

;Batman (Callinan): A depressed, alcoholic version of Batman. His Batmobile is a wreck, he has no work, and seems romantically attracted to Robin (Chamberlin). He is perpetually at odds with the more dynamic &quot;Captain Terrific&quot; (Helliar), who is now Robin&#x27;s partner.

;The &quot;I Love Beer&quot; Guy (Helliar): A man who, despite professing to everyone how much he loves beer, quite obviously cannot stomach the drink. Onlookers try to convince him that it is okay not to drink beer, but he refuses to acknowledge his dislike. This is a mockery of the common stereotype of the beer-drinking Australian male.

;The Ticket Lady (Harris): A perpetually cheerful parking inspector who is oblivious to how much she is hated by the general public; she often speaks highly of people while being pelted with rocks, eggs, and other heavy objects. Usually ends a sketch after having something thrown at her, by exclaiming &quot;I &quot;love&quot; this job!&quot;

;Glenn Bush (Brennan): An awkward, annoying schoolboy in his teens, with many pimples and a squeaky voice. Glenn is mostly portrayed at school camp in video diary format, or doing a school biology assignment with his &quot;friend&quot; (Chamberlin), who cannot get rid of him.

;Tripod as themselves: The three friends engaged in various strange or geeky activities, including playing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and teaching Yon how to dance.

;&quot;Nothing Suss!&quot; (Gleeson, Brennan): Two men attempt to sell odd products (normally partner exercise equipment) in the medium of an infomercial for their mail-order service. The two frequently use the exercise equipment to demonstrate and end up in sexually suggestive positions, while maintaining all the while that there is &quot;nothing &quot; about what they are doing.

The credits of each show are accompanied by a song by Tripod. While sometimes new material is used, it is sometimes a song previously featured in their &quot;Song In An Hour&quot; challenge with Triple J.

== Music and theme ==
The main title was composed by John Von Ahlen and recorded at Subterrane Recording Studio, and the end credits read &quot;Theme by John Von Ahlen for Planet J Productions&quot;. The incidental stings were also recorded at Subterrane Recording Studio. The credits of each show are accompanied by a song by Tripod. A compilation of expanded studio versions of these songs was later released as the album Middleborough Rd, which won an ARIA award in 2005 for Best Comedy Release.

==Awards and nominations==
===ARIA Music Awards===
The ARIA Music Awards are a set of annual ceremonies presented by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), which recognise excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of the music of Australia. They commenced in 1987.
