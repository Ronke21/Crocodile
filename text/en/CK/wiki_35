<text>Emery Avery John CM (born 18 June 1975) is a Trinidad and Tobago former professional footballer who played as a defender.

==Career==

===Youth and College===
John was born in Point Fortin. He attended Vessigny Government Secondary School and then Presentation College, and played college soccer for Yavapai College in Arizona and American University in Washington, DC. In his four seasons with American, John was named First Team All-Colonial Athletic Association and Second Team All-South Atlantic Region in his second year. In that same year, he helped win the CAA Championship and bring the team into the NCAA Quarterfinals.

===Professional===
In July 1998, John joined the New Orleans Storm of the USISL. In 2000, upon graduating, John played briefly in the American A-League, with the Steve Nicol-coached Boston Bulldogs. John spent much of his early professional career playing in the League of Ireland. John is perhaps best known in Ireland for playing for Bohemians, with whom he spent two spells and worked under three different managers. John was a fan favourite with Bohemians, where he became a cult figure who had several songs in his honour. John also had a brief spell with Shelbourne, and Longford Town after having been denied a work permit to sign for Colchester United following a successful preseason in 2002.

John moved to the United States to play for New England Revolution, and his old coach Steve Nicol, in Major League Soccer in 2004. John scored his first career goal in the 2004 MLS Cup Playoffs, helping New England win its first match 1-0 over the Columbus Crew in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.

With the Revolution, John was a regular member of the starting line-up in all his four years with the team, and despite with injuries, international duty, and occasional loss of form, never appeared in fewer than 10 games in a season.

On 1 May 2008, John signed with Miami FC of the USL First Division and played 15 games for the side. On 23 April 2009, he signed with D.C. United, after the team completed a trade for his rights. The Revolution, which had retained his MLS rights, traded those rights, in exchange for a conditional draft pick in either the 2010 or 2011 MLS SuperDraft. John was released by D.C. United on 20 January 2010.

===International===
John appeared in over 50 matches with the Trinidad and Tobago national team. In his first match at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he was dismissed with his second yellow card for a rash tackle on Sweden&#x27;s Christian Wilhelmsson, making John the first player to be sent off in the tournament and causing him to miss Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s high-profile game with England.

==Awards==
As a member of the Trinidad and Tobago squad that competed at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, John was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold Class), the second highest state decoration of Trinidad and Tobago.

<text>The Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST; ) is a public university in Wuhan, Hubei, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 985, Project 211, and the Double First-Class Construction.

It is a comprehensive key university directly under the Ministry of Education. Its history can be traced back to the original Huazhong Institute of Technology established in Wuhan in 1952, the Shanghai German Medical School (predecessor of Tongji University) founded by German physician Dr. Erich Paulun in 1907, and the original Central South School of Architecture and Engineering established in Mount Lu, Jiangxi province in the 1950s. The three schools merged to form Huazhong University of Science and Technology on May 26, 2000.

== History ==
After the 1949 Revolution, Wuhan was designated the leading city of the Central South region, one of six geographical divisions in China. The Huazhong Institute of Technology, established in 1953, was envisioned as a major national polytechnic institution, akin to Harbin Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Jiao Tong University, and Chongqing University within their respective regions. Under the leadership of Zhu Jiusi, the institute rapidly developed into a significant technological university during the 1950s.

In 1958, the institute expanded its scope by introducing programmes in basic and applied sciences, including mathematics, physics, and chemistry. However, these efforts were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. When Zhu Jiusi returned to the campus in 1970, he found the university largely abandoned and occupied by local farmers. He initiated efforts to rebuild the institution, recruiting scholars from top universities across China who had been sent to the countryside during the upheaval.

Following the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Deng Xiaoping’s return to power in 1978 marked a new era for higher education. That same year, Zhu Jiusi presented a report at a national meeting emphasising the dual importance of universities as centres for both research and teaching. After retiring in 1984, Zhu remained an influential figure in shaping China’s higher education.

In 1998, China launched Project 985 to develop world-class universities. Initially, the institution was not selected in the first batch. To improve its prospects, the Wuhan municipal government proposed merging the institute with Wuhan University. Following mediation by Education Minister Chen Zhili, a compromise was reached: Tongji Medical University and Wuhan Urban Construction University were merged into the institution and the institution was renamed as the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, while Wuhan University was consolidated with three other local universities. Both newly merged universities were subsequently included in Project 985.

Since the 1990s, the university has spearheaded the establishment of a state laboratory in opto-electronics, which later evolved into the Optics Valley, a prominent high-tech development zone near its campus.

<text>Kutztown University of Pennsylvania (Kutztown University or KU) is a public university in Kutztown, Pennsylvania. It is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) and is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

Founded in 1866, Kutztown University began as the Keystone Normal School based out of the presently-named Old Main Building and specializing in teacher education; in 1928, its name was changed to Kutztown State Teachers College. The school eventually expanded its programs outside education to be christened Kutztown State College in 1960 and finally, Kutztown University of Pennsylvania in 1983.

Between four undergraduate colleges and graduate studies, Kutztown University now offers programs in the liberal arts and sciences, the visual and performing arts, business, education, and certain graduate studies. Eight intercollegiate men&#x27;s sports and thirteen women&#x27;s sports compete within the NCAA Division II and the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC).

==History==

On September 15, 1866, the Keystone State Normal School was established on what is now the site of Old Main. The needs of a burgeoning industrialization in the region placed more and more demands on teacher preparation, and in 1928, the institution was designated Kutztown State Teacher&#x27;s College and authorized to confer the bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Eventually, the area&#x27;s need for liberally educated personnel to staff its industries outstripped the need for teachers. In 1960, the Pennsylvania Department of Education changed the institution&#x27;s name to Kutztown State College and diversified its goals toward &quot;A center for learning for the best possible education of the youth of Pennsylvania in the arts and sciences and preparation of able and dedicated teachers.&quot;

On July 1, 1983, the institution became Kutztown University of Pennsylvania of the State System of Higher Education.

As of Fall 2018, the university enrollment was approximately 8,300 full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate students.

==Academics==
Degrees offered included Bachelor of Arts in 24 subjects, Bachelor of Science in 30, Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in five, Bachelor of Science in Education in five, Bachelor of Social Work, Bachelor of Science in Leisure and Sport Studies, Bachelor of Science in Library Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts in three subjects.

The newly constructed Academic Forum within the north campus, opened January 2007, spans and holds seven smart classrooms for some courses, seating from between 85 and 200 students each, and features a central dining area. Approximately three percent of classes, including 70 of 2,200 sections offered at the university, are taught within the Academic Forum.

Additional renovations to academic buildings and current residence halls attempt to accommodate the rapid expansion of attendance, which has seen an increase of &quot;30 percent from 7,843 in 1996 to a record 10,193 students in the Fall of 2006.&quot; The addition to Schaeffer Auditorium is a prime example of one of the many renovation projects.

===Residence halls===

Kutztown University of Pennsylvania maintains fourteen residence halls (six coed, one single gender, 2 modified single gender), three apartment-style coed complexes, and one suite-style hall, which accommodate 4,400 students (approximately 49% of full-time undergraduates). All residence halls are wired for cable TV, telephone, and Internet and campus network access.

Cable TV, telephone, and Internet–Network access were introduced via one &quot;drop-down&quot; box in 1998. Telephone and Internet are under the Control of the Information Technology department, and Cable TV is provided by the local Service Electric company.

Due to rising growth in enrollment a new residence hall was completed in fall 2008 to accommodate the growing number of incoming freshmen. The F. Eugene Dixon residence hall, officially the &quot;largest residence hall in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education&quot; at approximately , gross, houses 857 beds and 14 efficiency apartments.

The university provides a large array of intramural and club sports programs for the student body. Leagues and tournaments are organized by the Recreational Services department every semester and range from badminton tournaments to rock climbing competitions.

===Golden Bears===
From the mid-1930s up until 1961, Kutztown&#x27;s sports teams were known as the Golden Avalanche. In 1961, Kutztown replaced the Golden Avalanche nickname with the Golden Bears as the university&#x27;s nickname. In later years, Golden Bear mascots came into play. Before 2005, Goldie and Griz served as the KU Golden Bear mascots. However, they were both &quot;graduated&quot; to make way for a new mascot. The Raymond Entertainment Group of Newark, Delaware, helped KU create the new mascot. On October 1, 2005, at Kutztown&#x27;s football game versus West Chester University, Kutztown University unveiled Avalanche as the school&#x27;s new mascot. Avalanche is so named to honor Kutztown State College during the time of the Golden Avalanche sports teams.

The Golden Bears can be seen in more places than the sports fields. Golden Bear statues are located near the basketball courts on South Campus and on North Campus near the Boehm Science Building. Along with the statues, several residential areas are named after the Golden Bear. Golden Bear Village South behind University Place and Golden Bear Village West next to Rothermel Hall are student apartments which hold the Golden Bear moniker.

<doc id="1127599" wikidata="Q1677297" url="?curid=1127599" title="Jackie Smith">
<text>Jackie Larue Smith (born February 23, 1940) is an American former professional football tight end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the St. Louis Cardinals and the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the Northwestern State Demons. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994.

==Early life==
Smith attended Kentwood High School, where he started out playing the clarinet for the school&#x27;s band. He decided to try out for the football team as a sophomore, but suffered a torn Achilles tendon that forced him to sit out the season. As a junior, he had osteomyelitis in his ankle, so he could only play in the second half of the last game of the season.

As a senior, he was named the starting tailback in the team&#x27;s single-wing formation, but suffered a serious hip injury in the fourth game and could not play the rest of the way, finishing his high school career after appearing in only 5 games.

He also lettered in track and field, competing in the mile relay, the quarter-mile, the low and high hurdles. He won a state championship in the hurdles.

==College career==
Northwestern Louisiana State College could only offer him half a scholarship for track, unless he would also agree to play football, so he could qualify for a full scholarship. &quot;They told me, &#x27;If you go out for the football team and don’t quit, we can give you a full scholarship,&#x27; &quot; Smith said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even have to play—just don&#x27;t quit.&quot;

Smith initially joined the football team to fulfill this provision, but he was good enough to become a starter. During his college career, he had few opportunities to prove his true worth in the Demons&#x27; run-oriented offense, leading the team in receiving in his last two years, but recording modest stats. In track, he competed in the hurdles.

In 1980, he was inducted into the Northwestern State Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1983, he was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==

===St. Louis Cardinals===
Smith was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the tenth round (129th overall) of the 1963 NFL draft, based on the recommendation of Jack Rockwell, then a Cardinals trainer and a part-time scout, who saw him in a spring game during his senior season, where he showed enough speed to stand out. He was a part of a group of 10 rookies that made the team that year.

He was originally projected to play flanker, but was named the starter at tight end after Taz Anderson was injured. In the fifth game of the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he posted 212 yards and 2 touchdowns on 9 receptions, while playing a key role in a 24–23 win. He would not relinquish his starter position and would become a team co-captain.

Besides being a talented receiver, Smith displayed elite conditioning and ran with great determination, not only avoiding tacklers but also running through them. He was an excellent blocker, in an era where the tight ends were expected to block more than feature their receiving skills. He was the team starting punter from 1964 to 1966, until Chuck Latourette took over the role.

His best season came in 1967, when in 14 games he registered 56 receptions for 1,295 (third on the league), 21.5 yard-average per reception and 9 touchdowns. Smith proved his durability by playing in 121 straight games, until suffering torn ligaments in the ninth game of the 1971 season.

In 1974 and 1975, he was a part of the NFC East divisional champions. In 1975, although he played in only 9 games, he contributed to the Cardinals setting an NFL record by allowing only 8 sacks in 14 games.

Injuries that included a problem with the arch in one foot and a spinal condition (his arms would go numb after being tackled) affected him in his last two years.

In 1976, he was passed on the depth chart by J. V. Cain and was relegated to a backup role. On December 4, 1977, he announced his retirement after playing 15 seasons and 198 games. In August 1978, it was reported in the media that the Cardinals contacted Smith to return, but no contract was offered.

Smith played in five straight Pro Bowls and posted more than 40 receptions in seven seasons. He is tied for the most seasons played in a Cardinals uniform with 15 and had a string of 45 straight games with at least one reception. Despite his individual accomplishments, the franchise&#x27;s success proved fleeting, as the Cardinals only made the playoffs twice in Smith&#x27;s 15 seasons with them, and were eliminated both times in their first round, with Smith catching only one pass in each game.

On January 29, 1994, Smith was officially voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, as the third tight end to ever receive this honor and recognized as one of the key players that helped revolutionize the position. In 1994, he was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. In 2001, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 2009, he was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame.

===Dallas Cowboys===
In late September 1978, the Cowboys needed to add depth at tight end after Jay Saldi fractured his arm in the fourth game of the season against the St. Louis Cardinals. Head coach Tom Landry called Smith on Monday, September 25, looking to convince him to come back from retirement and sign with the defending Super Bowl champions on September 28.

He reported to the team on Thursday, September 28, and provided depth against the Washington Redskins three days later. Although he was the oldest player (38 years old) in the Dallas Cowboys roster, not many could keep up with his running ability.

During the regular season, he was used as a blocking tight end in goal-line formations and did not record a start or a reception. He received a game ball for his blocking after a win against the Philadelphia Eagles.

In the NFC divisional playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons, the Cowboys were behind 20–13 in the third quarter and their starting quarterback Roger Staubach was out of the game with a concussion. Backup quarterback Danny White found Smith in the end zone (one of his 3 receptions) to tie the game and contribute to a 27–20 comeback win.

Smith eventually made his only trip to the Super Bowl, which would end up leaving a mark on his career. With the Cowboys trailing the Pittsburgh Steelers 21–14 in the third quarter of Super Bowl XIII, Smith dropped a third-down pass in the end zone from Staubach, so instead of tying the score, the team had to settle for a field goal. Although this wasn&#x27;t the only critical play or turning point of the game and Staubach has also stated at different times that it was a poorly thrown pass, because it was such an iconic play, Smith was singled out in the media for the 35–31 loss. ESPN ranked Smith&#x27;s dropped pass in the end zone #24 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Super Bowl Moments&quot;.

Smith retired again, even though the Cowboys still wanted him back for the 1979 season. At the time, Smith&#x27;s 7,918 career receiving yards were the most ever by an NFL tight end, until he was surpassed by Ozzie Newsome&#x27;s 7,980 yards in 1990. His 16.5 yards per catch average is currently the highest among all tight ends in the Hall of Fame.

==NFL career statistics==

<text>Shelbourne United Football Club was an Irish association football club based in Dublin. They are often confused with the similarly named current League of Ireland team Shelbourne. Both teams had their origins in the same Ringsend suburb and both teams played in the Leinster Senior League and the League of Ireland during the 1920s. However they were completely different teams. 

==History==
===Leinster Senior League===
In 1920–21 Shelbourne United won the Leinster Senior League Senior Division title. After Bohemians, Shelbourne and St James&#x27;s Gate, they became the fourth civilian team to win the league. Shelbourne United spent the 1921–22 season in the same league. Other teams in the Leinster Senior League Senior Division this season included Shamrock Rovers, Bohemians B, St James&#x27;s Gate B, Bray Unknowns, Midland Athletic, Pioneers, Brooklyn, Merrion, Glasnevin, CYMS and Richmond. During this season Shelbourne United played some home games at Beech Hill, Donnybrook. 

===League of Ireland===
The 1922–23 season saw the League of Ireland expand from eight to twelve teams. After Frankfort and YMCA dropped out, Shelbourne United became one of six new teams to join the league. The others were Shamrock Rovers, Midland Athletic, Pioneers, Athlone Town and Rathmines Athletic. Shelbourne United and Rathmines Athletic originally had their applications to join the league rejected at a meeting on 17 August 1922. They were only reconsidered after one of the original proposed expansion teams, University College Dublin, dropped out after concerns about their ability to field a team throughout the season. The League was also concerned about Shelbourne United&#x27;s plans to play their home games at Anglesea Road, on a pitch already used by Dublin United. However, after observing a friendly between the two teams, the league finally accepted Shelbourne United following another meeting on Monday, 4 September 1922. Less than two weeks later, they made their League of Ireland debut on Saturday, 16 September 1922, in a 1–0 away win against Shamrock Rovers. The 1922–23 season eventually saw Shelbourne United finish fourth behind Rovers, Shelbourne and Bohemians. In the 1922–23 FAI Cup they defeated Bohemians 2–1 in the round of sixteen and in the quarter-finals they lost over two games to the eventual winners Alton United. In their second and final season, 1923–24, they played their home games at Milltown Ground and finished sixth. They were quarter-finalists again in the 1923–24 FAI Cup, this time losing 2–1 to St James&#x27;s Gate. Shelbourne United withdrew from the League of Ireland on 7 September 1924, the day after the 1924–25 season had started. Their place in the league was awarded to Fordsons.

<doc id="1127612" wikidata="Q6170556" url="?curid=1127612" title="Jean Doumanian">
<text>Jean Doumanian ( Karabas; born July 28, 1936) is an American stage, television and film producer.

==Early life==
Doumanian was born Jeannine Karabas, the youngest of three children born to Greek immigrant parents and raised in Chicago. Her father was a restaurateur. She attended the University of Illinois but dropped out as a junior to marry John Doumanian, a promoter for Capitol Records. While out with her husband, who was scouting new talent in the clubs of Chicago, she met stand-up comedian Woody Allen, who was sharing a billing with Capitol singer Nancy Wilson. A friendship developed after Allen&#x27;s manager, Jack Rollins, asked the couple to show Allen around Chicago and her husband became Allen&#x27;s road manager.

==Career==

The Doumanians divorced and John Doumanian moved to California. Jean moved to New York at the request of up-and-coming comedian Dick Cavett as a pre-interviewer and writer for ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Dick Cavett Show;&quot; and then as an associate producer for &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot;. In 1975, she took a position with NBC as associate producer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===

Show creator Lorne Michaels resigned as producer of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the end of its fifth season and the entire cast and writing staff followed, with the exception of writer Brian Doyle-Murray. Doumanian, who had been an associate producer during the first five seasons of the show and produced a special for Michaels in 1978, was one of the few who remained. She was offered Michaels&#x27; job running &quot;SNL&quot;, much to Michaels&#x27; surprise, and took over the show for the 1980 season, hiring a completely new cast and new writers.

Doumanian&#x27;s tenure as &quot;SNL&quot; executive producer was tumultuous. She hired Denny Dillon, Gilbert Gottfried, Gail Matthius, Joe Piscopo, Ann Risley and Charles Rocket as repertory players, and Yvonne Hudson, Matthew Laurance and Patrick Weathers as featured players. Then-unknown Eddie Murphy would join the show as a featured player on the fourth episode and was upgraded to repertory status on January 24, 1981.

With its team of all-new writers and cast members, the show was plagued with problems from the start. It was deemed a commercial disappointment, and suffered from competition with ABC&#x27;s new weekend show, &quot;Fridays&quot;, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation import &quot;SCTV&quot;, which NBC aired following the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; on Fridays, as well as budget cuts.

In a cliffhanger titled &quot;Who Shot C.R.&quot; from the episode on February 21, 1981, cast member Charles Rocket was &quot;shot&quot; after cast members shared their grievances with Rocket and with one another. When that episode&#x27;s host, Charlene Tilton, asked Rocket what it felt like to be shot, he replied &quot;Oh man, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been shot in my life. I&#x27;d like to know who the fuck did it.&quot; The uncensored expletive, seemingly planned, landed the show, its producer and the network in trouble. After one further episode on March 7, 1981, the show was put on a month-long hiatus after NBC executives decided the show needed an immediate overhaul, and Doumanian was dismissed from her position at &quot;SNL&quot; and replaced by Dick Ebersol, who fired Gottfried, Risley and Rocket before the end of the hiatus. After one episode on April 11, the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike began, causing the season to end early. After the season ended, Ebersol fired Matthius and Dillon. Only Piscopo, Murphy, and writers Pam Norris, Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield remained from Doumanian&#x27;s tenure when the next season started. One of Doumanian&#x27;s writers, Terry Sweeney, would become a cast member on the show in 1985 after Lorne Michaels returned to replace Ebersol.

On February 15, 2015, Doumanian attended the &quot;SNL&quot; 40th anniversary special.

===Film===
After leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, Doumanian was a producer for several of Woody Allen&#x27;s films:
*&quot;Bullets over Broadway&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995)
*&quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; (1996)
*&quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997)
*&quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998)
*&quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999)
*&quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000)

She co-produced the 1994 made-for-television film &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; and the 1997 documentary, &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot;, a film about a tour by Woody Allen&#x27;s jazz band. During production of &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot; in 2000, however, she reportedly shocked Allen with the abrupt announcement that he had 48 hours to find alternative funding for the film. In May 2001, Allen filed a lawsuit against Doumanian and her business partner and long-time boyfriend Jacqui Safra, before Judge Ira Gammerman in the New York Supreme Court, claiming their production company had skimmed profits off of the movies. The lawsuit was settled in 2002 for an undisclosed amount.

Other films which Doumanian has produced or co-produced include &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;, &quot;All the Real Girls&quot;, and &quot;The Ox&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award (Best Foreign Language Film) in 1992. She produced the 2013 film &quot;&quot;, which garnered Academy Award nominations for its stars, Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts.

===Theater===
Doumanian has been producer on many Broadway productions, including &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;, &quot;Amour&quot;, &quot;Jumpers&quot;, &quot;Democracy&quot;, the Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;&quot;, &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;, &quot;Superior Donuts&quot;, the Tony Award-winning &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;, &quot;The Motherfucker with the Hat&quot;, &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot;, &quot;The Mountaintop&quot;, the Tony Award-winning 2012 revival of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, &quot;Nice Work If You Can Get It&quot;, and &quot;The Testament of Mary&quot;. 

Off-Broadway, she produced David Cromer&#x27;s acclaimed production of &quot;Our Town&quot;, which garnered Lucille Lortel Awards for Outstanding Production and Outstanding Direction and an Obie Award for Outstanding Director. She also produced David Cromer&#x27;s production of &quot;Tribes&quot;, which won the 2011-2012 New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Play as well as the 2012 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play. Additional Off Broadway credits include &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot;. On London&#x27;s West End, she produced &quot;The Mountaintop&quot;, winner of the 2010 Olivier Award for Best New Play, and &quot;Chimerica&quot;.

<text>Steven Bryce Valerio (born August 16, 1977) is a Costa Rican former footballer. Bryce was well known throughout his career for his versatility, playing as an attacking midfielder, winger, striker or right back, as needed; and possessing good skills, pace, and strength.

==Club career==
Bryce began his career in the Costa Rican first division on loan from Deportivo Saprissa with AD Goicoechea, making his debut on September 22, 1996 against Herediano. After that he played for Deportivo Saprissa and Liga Deportiva Alajuelense whom he joined in August 2000. In his 9 years in Costa Rica, Bryce won 6 national championships, in 1997-98, 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02, 2002–03 and 2003-04. In addition, he won a CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 2004.

After his tenure with Alajuelense, he went to play with Anorthosis of the Cypriot First Division and OFI Crete of the Greek Super League. He came back to America after a couple of unsuccessful season in Europe and was signed by Brujas, a new club in his native Costa Rica owned by a local magnate. Six months later he decided to move to Marathón in Honduras and then to F.C. Motagua. He never found his form and game in Honduras and by the end of his contract with F.C. Motagua, he suffered and injury that took him out of the fields for almost a year. He signed for Liga Deportiva Alajuelense and started his recovery but did not make it to the pitch one game and was released in summer 2008. In the 2009-2010 season, Bryce was called up by Universidad de Costa Rica a team that desperatively needed players with experience, but again, he never found his form and was released after a few months.

In January 2010, Bryce signed a 1-year deal with Brisbane Roar, but the story repeated itself and just after a few games he decided to put an end on his contract and definitively retire from football.

==International career==
At junior level, Bryce played in 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Malaysia, playing in all three of the team&#x27;s matches, scoring once against Paraguay.

He made his debut for the senior national team in a January 1998 friendly match against Honduras and collected a total of 73 caps, scoring 9 goals. He has represented his country in 18 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. and played at the 1999 and 2003 UNCAF Nations Cups as well as at the 2002, 2003 and 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cups and the 2001 and 2004 Copa América.

Most notably however, he represented Costa Rica in the 2002 World Cup, playing in all three of the team&#x27;s matches, and assisting on one goal against each of Brazil and Turkey.

He also was a non-playing squad member at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

<doc id="1127625" wikidata="Q913616" url="?curid=1127625" title="Meet the Beatles!">
<text>Meet the Beatles! is a studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, released as their second album in the United States. It was the group&#x27;s first American album to be issued by Capitol Records, on 20 January 1964 in both mono and stereo formats. It topped the popular album chart on 15 February 1964 and remained at number one for eleven weeks before being replaced by &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;. The cover featured Robert Freeman&#x27;s iconic portrait of the Beatles used in the United Kingdom for &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, with a blue tint added to the original stark black-and-white photograph.

==Background==

After EMI&#x27;s subsidiary Capitol Records repeatedly rejected requests by both Brian Epstein and George Martin to release Beatles records in the United States, EMI label head Sir Joseph Lockwood sent a deputy to Los Angeles in November 1963 ordering Capitol Records to commence promoting and releasing Beatles records in the United States. Despite the &quot;first album&quot; claim on the &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; cover, ten days prior to its release, Vee-Jay Records of Chicago beat Capitol to the punch with the release on 10 January 1964 of the Beatles&#x27; American debut album &quot;Introducing... The Beatles,&quot; which had been delayed for release for various reasons since the previous summer. Perhaps as a result of the Vee-Jay release, Liberty Music Shops advertised in the &quot;New York Times&quot; of 12 January 1964 that &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; was available for purchase, an ad not authorised by Capitol.

In 2004, the album was released for the first time on compact disc in both stereo and mono as part of &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot; box set, containing the original US stereo and mono mixes. In 2014, &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; was reissued on CD, individually and included in the Beatles boxed set &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;. Although following the running order for &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot;, the mixes featured in this reissue are the UK mono and stereo mixes.

==Music==
By November 1963, the Beatles had already recorded over 35 songs for EMI&#x27;s UK Parlophone label, while Capitol Records in the US planned to release an album and a single, and more at a later date. The US rights to the Beatles&#x27; first 14 tracks were held by Vee Jay Records along with a few others. &quot;She Loves You&quot; had been issued in America on the Swan label and also sold poorly. In Britain, Parlophone was already releasing its second Beatles album &quot;With the Beatles&quot; and had issued several singles which were not included on any UK albums with the exception of the first two (&quot;Please Please Me&quot;/&quot;Ask Me Why&quot; and &quot;Love Me Do&quot;/&quot;PS I Love You&quot;). While the Beatles&#x27; first two British albums each contained 14 tracks, in the American market albums were typically limited to 12 tracks and it was expected that albums would include the current hit single.

The first three tracks on the album include the December 1963 Capitol single &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; along with the record&#x27;s US B-side, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There,&quot; and its UK B-side, &quot;This Boy,&quot; from the original November 1963 release. Neither &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; nor &quot;This Boy&quot; had appeared on an album at the time in the UK, while &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; had been the lead-off track to the band&#x27;s debut album. The other nine tracks on &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; were duplicated from its nearest UK counterpart album, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;. Those were original Beatles songs and not cover versions of songs by other artists with the exception of &quot;Till There Was You&quot;. The remaining five tracks from &quot;With the Beatles&quot; were songs originally recorded by other artists. Capitol determined that for their first album they would only include original and fresh material. Capitol executives worried that the covers would turn Americans off the Beatles. The other five songs would appear on Capitol&#x27;s next American LP, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;, released in April 1964. The songs &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;This Boy&quot; are in a duophonic [fake] stereo, because Capitol had not been provided proper stereo mixes.

== Critical reception ==

The album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2001, the album was inducted into Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2003, the album was ranked at number 59 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, re-ranked at number 53 on the 2012 list, and re-ranked at number 197 in 2020.

==Commercial performance==

In the U.S., the album debuted at No. 92 on the album chart for the week ending 1 February 1964. Two weeks later, it peaked at #1 where it remained for eleven consecutive weeks, eventually to be replaced by &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;. It sold 4,045,174 copies by 31 December 1964, and 4,699,348 copies by the end of the decade. It was certified Gold by the RIAA on 3 February 1964, and 5× Platinum on 26 December 1991.

<text>The Cobra Killer duo of Gina V. D&#x27;Orio and Annika Trost began as part of Alec Empire&#x27;s Digital hardcore movement. Both were part of other bands signed to Empire&#x27;s Digital Hardcore Recordings label—D&#x27;Orio was in EC8OR, and Trost was in Shizuo.

When Empire&#x27;s label cut back on its bands, many of the DHR groups folded, but D&#x27;Orio and Trost kept going. They have released four albums and are currently on the Monika Enterprise label. Cobra Killer played with Sonic Youth and collaborates with many international artists. Peaches played her first gig as support act of Cobra Killer in Berlin.

<text>Cranborne Chase () is an area of central southern England, straddling the counties Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire. It is part of the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

The area is dominated by, and often considered to be synonymous with, a chalk downland plateau. Part of the English Chalk Formation, it is adjacent to Salisbury Plain and the West Wiltshire Downs in the north, and the Dorset Downs to the south west. The highest point is Win Green Down, in Wiltshire, at .

Historically a medieval hunting forest, the area is also noted for its Neolithic and Bronze age archaeology and its rural agricultural character.

==Definitions==
As an informally defined region, the boundaries of Cranborne Chase vary depending on usage. When defined as the chalk plateau, it is clearly bounded by escarpments which face the valleys of the Blackmore Vale to the west, the Vale of Wardour to the north, and the Hampshire Avon to the east. To the south the chalk gently slopes, giving way more subtly to the Dorset Heaths landscape around Verwood and Wimborne Minster.

The name is derived from its historic use as a medieval hunting forest, which at its height covered an area bounded by Salisbury, Shaftesbury, Blandford Forum, Wimborne Minster and Ringwood, incorporating a slightly larger area than just the chalk plateau. Early written records of this definition include a jury verdict at New Sarum in 1246 and the &quot;Quo Warranto&quot; of Edward I, issued in or around 1280. Over time this estate shrank, and the term has also been used to describe a smaller remnant area of around by immediately to the west of Cranborne village.

A more recent usage of the term, used since 2014 by the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs AONB Partnership of local authorities, has been to promote the much larger AONB area simply as &quot;Cranborne Chase AONB&quot;. This usage includes a large area outside of the more established landscape and historical definitions of Cranborne Chase, including the West Wiltshire Downs and an area of greensand landscape on the Somerset-Wiltshire border around Longleat and Stourhead.

==History and archaeology==

The downland has a long history with many earthworks and archaeology from the Neolithic age onwards. The dense woodland originally covering the downs would have gradually been cleared by the first farmers, but would have grown back repeatedly over the centuries as soils became exhausted and the agricultural carrying capacity of the land was exceeded several times over the course of six millennia. Much of the area therefore remained wooded from the Middle Ages until World War II.

Analysis of remains found in some of the Bronze Age burial mounds, by experts at Bournemouth University, has revealed that many of the bones had small holes drilled in then, enabling them, it is hypothesised, to have been articulated by means of wooden pegs, i.e. the skeletons were prevented from falling apart during repeated removal and re-burial.

There are many Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, including the henge monuments at Knowlton and the remains of a number of Iron Age settlements on the downs, most notably the hill fort at Badbury Rings (&quot;Vindocladia&quot;). There is a Roman villa which has been dug by archaeological television programme &quot;Time Team&quot;. During the Saxon invasion of England the Romano-British kept the invaders out of Dorset by building Bokerley Dyke, a defensive ditch, across the Roman Road that runs across the downs from Dorchester to Old Sarum.

The downs have been sparsely populated since Saxon times, largely preserving archaeology until World War II when the need for agricultural land outweighed the archaeological importance. It was here that Augustus Pitt Rivers developed modern archaeological field work in the 19th century.

The downs are named after the village Cranborne, founded by the Saxons, which had a manor house and a small monastery. The word &quot;chase&quot; comes from the hunts, frequented by royalty (including Kings John, Henry VIII and James I), which took place on the downs.

The first known owner of the chase is thought to have been Brictric. His possessions were confiscated by Queen Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror; on her death, it passed to the Crown, and was granted, with other lands forming the feudal barony of Gloucester, to Robert Fitzhamon in 1083. This passed to his son-in-law Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester. Ownership of the chase passed through successive Earls of Gloucester until the death of Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester in 1314. The chase passed to his sister Elizabeth de Clare (d. 1360), and thence to her granddaughter Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster (d. 1363). The Countess was succeeded by her daughter Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster (d. 1382), wife of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March. The chase was owned by successive Earls of March until 1461, when the last Earl was crowned as Edward IV of England. Cranborne Chase remained crown property until 1616, when it was granted to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. His great-grandson, the 3rd Earl, sold it to Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury in 1671. His son, the 2nd Earl, sold it in 1692 to Thomas Freke (d. 1701), who bequeathed it to Elizabeth Freke (the wife of his kinsman, also Thomas Freke) and her father Thomas Pile, with reversion to George Pitt should she die without children. Pitt inherited Cranborne Chase from her in 1714, and it passed from father to son in the Pitt family to his great-grandson George Pitt, 2nd Baron Rivers, after whose death it was disfranchised.

Much of the Chase is still owned by large estates such as Kingston Lacy.

Cranborne Chase School, a former boarding school for girls, was based at two locations in Cranborne Chase: at Crichel House near the village of Moor Crichel in Dorset from 1946 to 1961, and then at New Wardour Castle in the settlement of Wardour (near the village of Tisbury) in Wiltshire, until the School&#x27;s closure in 1990.

== Geography ==

=== Natural region ===
Cranborne Chase is part of a National Character Area (No. 134), &quot;Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase&quot;, designated by Natural England.

=== Hills ===
The landscape of Cranborne Chase is remarkably varied, its most dramatic scenery being near the boundary between Dorset and Wiltshire where the chalk downland rises sharply to the rounded summits of Breeze Hill (262 m), with the hairpin bends of the B3081 climbing Zig Zag Hill on its northwestern flanks, and Win Green (277 m). Nearby, another prominent top, Melbury Hill (263 m) above Melbury Abbas, &quot;appears almost like an island rising above the flat, sea-like expanses of&quot; Compton Abbas airfield.

Further south are two more summits on an outlier of the Chase that define its southern limits: Hambledon and Hod Hills.

==Biodiversity==

An area of of Cranborne Chase has been notified as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, notification initially taking place in 1975.

As some of the wooded areas in the chase are centuries old, they possess a diverse ground flora that is associated with such sites. The area is one of the richest in southern England for numbers of lichen species; over 160 have been recorded.

<text>Coluracetam (INN; development code BCI-540; formerly MKC-231) is a purported nootropic agent of the racetam family. It contains a chemical group that is a bioisostere of the 9-amino-tetrahydroacridine family. It was initially developed and tested by the Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. After the drug failed to reach endpoints in its clinical trials it was in-licensed by BrainCells Inc for investigations into major depressive disorder (MDD), which was preceded by being awarded a &quot;Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Program Grant&quot; by the state of California. Findings from phase IIa clinical trials have suggested that it would be a potential medication for comorbid MDD with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). BrainCells Inc is currently out-licensing the drug for this purpose. It may also have potential use in prevention and treatment of ischemic retinopathy and retinal and optic nerve injury.

Coluracetam has been shown to reverse the loss of choline acetyltransferase production in the medial septal nucleus of rats exposed to phencyclidine (PCP), and is considered a potential therapeutic drug for schizophrenia.

==Mechanism of action==
Coluracetam enhances high-affinity choline uptake (HACU), which is the rate-limiting step of acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. Studies have shown coluracetam to improve learning impairment on a single oral dose given to rats which have been exposed to cholinergic neurotoxins. Subsequent studies have shown that it may induce long-lasting procognitive effects in cholinergic neurotoxin-treated rats by changing the choline transporter regulation system.

== Legality ==
=== Australia ===
Coluracetam is a schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 4 substance is classified as &quot;Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription.&quot;

<doc id="1127639" wikidata="Q1549285" url="?curid=1127639" title="Mise en abyme">
<text>In Western art history, mise en abyme (; also mise en abîme) is the technique of placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the story within a story technique. 

The term is derived from heraldry and means &quot;placed into abyss&quot;. It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author André Gide. A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two mirrors and seeing an infinite reproduction of one&#x27;s image. Another is the Droste effect, in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear. The Droste effect is named after the 1904 Droste cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.

==Heraldry==

In the terminology of heraldry, the &quot;abyme&quot; or &quot;abisme&quot; is the center of a coat of arms. The term &quot;mise en abyme&quot; (also called inescutcheon) then meant “put/placed in the center”. It described a coat of arms that appears as a smaller shield in the center of a larger one (see Droste effect).

A complex example of &quot;mise en abyme&quot; is seen in the coat of arms of the United Kingdom for the period 1801–1837, as used by Kings George III, George IV and William IV. The crown of Charlemagne is placed &quot;en abyme&quot; within the escutcheon of Hanover, which in turn is &quot;en abyme&quot; within the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

==Medieval examples==

While art historians working on the early-modern period adopted this phrase and interpreted it as showing artistic &quot;self-awareness&quot;, medievalists tended not to use it. Many examples, however, can be found in the pre-modern era, as in a mosaic from the Hagia Sophia dated to the year 944. To the left, Justinian I offers the Virgin Mary the Hagia Sophia, which contains the mosaic itself. To the right, Constantine I offers the city of Constantinople (now known as Istanbul), which itself contains the Hagia Sophia.

More medieval examples can be found in the collection of articles &quot;Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself&quot;, in which Jersey Ellis conjectures that the self-references sometimes are used to strengthen the symbolism of gift-giving by documenting the act of giving on the object itself. An example of this self-referential gift-giving appears in the Stefaneschi Triptych in the Vatican Museum, which features Cardinal Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi as the giver of the altarpiece.

==Critical theory and art history==
In Western art history, &quot;mise en abyme&quot; is a formal technique in which an image contains a smaller copy of itself, in a sequence appearing to recur infinitely; &quot;recursion&quot; is another term for this. The modern meaning of the phrase originates with the author André Gide who used it to describe self-reflexive embeddings in various art forms and to describe what he sought in his work. As examples, Gide cites both paintings such as by Diego Velázquez and literary forms such as William Shakespeare&#x27;s use of the &quot;play within a play&quot; device in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, where a theatrical company presents a performance for the characters that illuminate a thematic aspect of the play itself. This use of the phrase &quot;mise en abyme&quot; was picked up by scholars and popularized in the 1977 book &quot;Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme&quot; by Lucien Dällenbach.

==In mass media==

&quot;Mise en abyme&quot; occurs in a text when there is a reduplication of images or concepts referring to the textual whole. &quot;Mise en abyme&quot; is a play of signifiers within a text, of sub-texts mirroring each other. This mirroring can attain a level where meaning may become unstable and, in this respect, may be seen as part of the process of deconstruction. The film-within-a-film, where a film contains a plot about the making of a film, is an example of &quot;mise en abyme&quot;. The film being made within the film refers, through its &quot;mise en scène&quot;, to the real film being made. The spectator sees film equipment, stars getting ready for the take, and crew sorting out the various directorial needs. The narrative of the film within the film may directly reflect the one in the real film. An example is Björk&#x27;s video Bachelorette, directed by Michel Gondry. An example is &quot;La Nuit américaine&quot; (1973) by François Truffaut.

In film, the meaning of &quot;mise en abyme&quot; is similar to the artistic definition, but also includes the idea of a &quot;dream within a dream&quot;. For example, a character awakens from a dream and later discovers that they are still dreaming. Activities similar to dreaming, such as unconsciousness and virtual reality, also are described as &quot;mise en abyme&quot;. This is seen in the film &quot;eXistenZ&quot; where the two protagonists never truly know whether or not they are out of the game. It also becomes a prominent element of Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008). More recent instances can be found in the films &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2007) and &quot;Inception&quot; (2010). Classic film examples include the snow globe in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) which provides a clue to the film&#x27;s core mystery, and the discussion of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s written works (particularly &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;) in the Jean-Luc Godard film &quot;Band of Outsiders&quot; (1964).

In literary criticism, &quot;mise en abyme&quot; is a type of frame story, in which the core narrative may be used to illuminate some aspect of the framing story. The term is used in deconstruction and deconstructive literary criticism as a paradigm of the intertextual nature of language, that is, of the way, language never quite reaches the foundation of reality because it refers in a frame-within-a-frame way, to another language, which refers to another language, and so forth.

In video games, the first chapter of the game &quot;There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension&quot; (2020) is titled &quot;Mise en abyme&quot;.

In comedy, the final act of &quot;The Inside Outtakes&quot; (2022) by Bo Burnham contains a chapter titled &quot;Mise en abyme&quot;. It shows footage being projected into a monitor that is captured by the camera, slightly delayed at each step. This effect highlights the disconnection between Burnham and the project during the artistic process.

<doc id="1127640" wikidata="Q693614" url="?curid=1127640" title="King of Jerusalem">
<text>The king or queen of Jerusalem was the supreme ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a Crusader state founded in Jerusalem by the Latin Catholic leaders of the First Crusade, when the city was conquered in 1099. Most of them were men, but there were also five queens regnant of Jerusalem, either reigning alone &quot;suo jure&quot; (&quot;in her own right&quot;), or as co-rulers of husbands who reigned as kings of Jerusalem &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (&quot;by right of his wife&quot;).

Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, refused the title of king choosing instead the title , that is Advocate or Defender of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1100 Baldwin I, Godfrey&#x27;s successor, was the first ruler crowned as king. The crusaders in Jerusalem were conquered in 1187, but their Kingdom of Jerusalem survived, moving the capital to Acre in 1191. Crusaders re-captured the city of Jerusalem in the Sixth Crusade, during 1229–1239 and 1241–1244.

The Kingdom of Jerusalem was finally dissolved with the fall of Acre and the end of the Crusades in the Holy Land in 1291.

Even after the Crusader States ceased to exist, the title of &quot;King of Jerusalem&quot; was claimed by a number of European noble houses descended from the kings of Cyprus or the kings of Naples, and is claimed by the current king of Spain.

==Kings of Jerusalem (1099–1291)==

The Kingdom of Jerusalem had its origins in the First Crusade, when proposals to govern the city as an ecclesiastical state were rejected. In 1099 Godfrey of Bouillon was elected as the first Latin ruler of Jerusalem and was inaugurated in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. He took the title of prince and &quot;Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri&quot;, meaning Advocate of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This was probably in response to the opinion that only Christ could wear a crown in Jerusalem. &quot;Advocatus&quot; was a title with which Godfrey was already familiar as the term was much used in the lands where the Crusaders originated; it referred to a layman who protected and administered Church estates. The following year, Godfrey died. His brother Baldwin I was the first to use the title of king and the first to be crowned king in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem itself.

The kingship of Jerusalem was partially elective and partially hereditary. During the height of the kingdom in the mid-12th century there was a royal family and a relatively clear line of succession. Nevertheless, the king was elected, or at least recognized, by the Haute Cour. Here the king was considered a primus inter pares (first among equals), and in his absence his duties were performed by his seneschal.

The purpose-built royal palace used from the 1160s onwards was located south of Jerusalem&#x27;s citadel. The Kingdom of Jerusalem introduced French feudal structures to the Levant. The king personally held several fiefs incorporated into the royal domain, that varied from king to king. He was also responsible for leading the kingdom into battle, although this duty could be passed to a constable.

While several contemporary European states were moving towards centralized monarchies, the king of Jerusalem was continually losing power to the strongest of his barons. This was partially due to the young age of many of the kings, and the frequency of regents from the ranks of the nobles.

After the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, the capital of the kingdom was moved to Acre, where it remained until 1291, although coronations took place in Tyre.

In this period the kingship was often simply a nominal position, held by a European ruler who never actually lived in Acre. When young Conrad III was king and living in Southern Germany, his father&#x27;s second cousin, Hugh of Brienne, claimed the regency of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and, indirectly, his place in the succession. The claim was made in 1264 as senior descendant and rightful heir of Alice of Champagne, second daughter of Queen Isabella I, Hugh being the son of their eldest daughter. But was passed over by the Haute Cour in favour of his cousin, Hugh of Antioch, the future Hugh III of Cyprus and Hugh I of Jerusalem.

After Conrad III&#x27;s execution by Charles I of Sicily in 1268, the kingship was held by the Lusignan family, who were simultaneously kings of Cyprus. However, Charles I of Sicily purchased the rights of one of the heirs of the kingdom in 1277.

In that year, he sent Roger of Sanseverino to the East as his bailiff. Roger captured Acre and obtained a forced homage from the barons. Roger was recalled in 1282 due to the Sicilian Vespers and left Odo Poilechien in his place to rule. His resources and authority was minimal, and he was ejected by Henry II of Cyprus when he arrived from Cyprus for his coronation as King of Jerusalem.

Acre was captured by the Mamluks in 1291, eliminating the crusader presence on the mainland.

===House of Boulogne (1099–1118)===
===House of Rethel (1118–1153)===
===House of Anjou (1153–1205)===
In 1127 Fulk V, Count of Anjou, received an embassy from King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter Melisende to succeed him. Baldwin II wanted to safeguard his daughter&#x27;s inheritance by marrying her to a powerful lord. Fulk was a wealthy crusader and experienced military commander, and a widower. His experience in the field would prove invaluable in a frontier state always in the grip of war.

However, Fulk held out for better terms than mere consort of the Queen; he wanted to be king alongside Melisende. Baldwin II, reflecting on Fulk&#x27;s fortune and military exploits, acquiesced. Fulk then resigned his titles to his son Geoffrey and sailed to become King of Jerusalem, where he married Melisende on 2 June 1129. Later Baldwin II bolstered Melisende&#x27;s position in the kingdom by making her sole guardian of her son by Fulk, Baldwin III, born in 1130.

Fulk and Melisende became joint rulers of Jerusalem in 1131 with Baldwin II&#x27;s death. From the start Fulk assumed sole control of the government, excluding Melisende altogether. He favored fellow countrymen from Anjou to the native nobility. The other crusader states to the north feared that Fulk would attempt to impose the suzerainty of Jerusalem over them, as Baldwin II had done; but as Fulk was far less powerful than his deceased father-in-law, the northern states rejected his authority.

In Jerusalem as well, Fulk was resented by the second generation of Jerusalem Christians who had grown up there since the First Crusade. These &quot;natives&quot; focused on Melisende&#x27;s cousin, the popular Hugh II of Le Puiset, count of Jaffa, who was devotedly loyal to the Queen. Fulk saw Hugh as a rival, and in 1134, in order to expose Hugh, accused him of infidelity with Melisende. Hugh rebelled in protest and secured himself to Jaffa, allying himself with the Muslims of Ascalon. He was able to defeat the army set against him by Fulk, but this situation could not hold. The Patriarch interceded in the conflict, perhaps at the behest of Melisende. Fulk agreed to peace and Hugh was exiled from the kingdom for three years, a lenient sentence.

However, an assassination attempt was made against Hugh. Fulk, or his supporters, were commonly believed responsible, though direct proof never surfaced. The scandal was all that was needed for the queen&#x27;s party to take over the government in what amounted to a palace coup. Author and historian Bernard Hamilton wrote that the Fulk&#x27;s supporters &quot;went in terror of their lives&quot; in the palace. Contemporary author and historian William of Tyre wrote of Fulk &quot;he never attempted to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without (Melisende&#x27;s) consent&quot;. The result was that Melisende held direct and unquestioned control over the government from 1136 onwards. Sometime before 1136 Fulk reconciled with his wife, and a second son, Amalric, was born.

In 1143, while the king and queen were on holiday in Acre, Fulk was mortally wounded in a hunting accident. His horse stumbled, fell, and Fulk&#x27;s skull was crushed by the saddle, &quot;and his brains gushed forth from both ears and nostrils&quot;, as William of Tyre describes. He was carried back to Acre, where he lay unconscious for three days before he died. He was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Though their marriage started in conflict, Melisende mourned for him privately as well as publicly. Fulk was survived by his son Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou by his first wife, and Baldwin III and Amalric I by Melisende.

Baldwin III ascended the throne with his mother as co-ruler, in 1143. His early reign was laced with squabbles with his mother over the possession of Jerusalem, till 1153, when he took personal hold of the government. He died in 1163, without heirs, and the kingdom passed to his brother, Amalric I, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Amalric&#x27;s wife Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the &quot;Haute Cour&quot; refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled. The hostility to Agnes may have been exaggerated by the chronicler William of Tyre, whom she prevented from becoming Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem decades later, as well as from William&#x27;s continuators like Ernoul, who hints at a slight on her moral character: &quot;car telle n&#x27;est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem&quot; (&quot;there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem&quot;).

Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief&#x27;s income. The church ruled that Agnes&#x27;s children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through them Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years. Almaric was succeeded by his son by Agnes, Baldwin IV.

Almaric&#x27;s first wife Agnes of Courtenay was now married to Reginald of Sidon;Maria Comnena, the dowager Queen, had married Balian of Ibelin in 1177. His daughter by Agnes, Sibylla, was already of age, the mother of a son, and was clearly in a strong position to succeed her brother, but Maria&#x27;s daughter Isabella had the support of her stepfather&#x27;s family, the Ibelins.

In 1179, Baldwin began planning to marry Sibylla to Hugh III of Burgundy, but by spring 1180 this was still unresolved. Raymond III of Tripoli attempted a coup, and began to march on Jerusalem with Bohemund III, to force the king to marry his sister to a local candidate of his own choosing, probably Baldwin of Ibelin, Balian&#x27;s older brother. To counter this, the king hastily arranged her marriage to Guy of Lusignan, younger brother of Amalric, the constable of the kingdom. A foreign match was essential to bring the possibility of external military aid to the kingdom. With the new French king Philip II a minor, Guy&#x27;s status as a vassal of the King and Sibylla&#x27;s first cousin Henry II of England – who owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage – was useful.

By 1182, Baldwin IV, increasingly incapacitated by his leprosy, named Guy as &quot;bailli&quot;. Raymond contested this, but when Guy fell out of favour with Baldwin the following year, he was re-appointed &quot;bailli&quot; and was given possession of Beirut. Baldwin came to an agreement with Raymond and the Haute Cour to make Baldwin of Montferrat, Sibylla&#x27;s son by her first marriage, his heir, before Sibylla and Guy. The child was crowned co-king as Baldwin V in 1183 in a ceremony presided by Raymond. It was agreed that, should the boy die during his minority, the regency would pass to &quot;the most rightful heirs&quot; until his kinsmen – the Kings of England and France and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor – and the Pope were able to adjudicate between the claims of Sibylla and Isabella. These &quot;most rightful heirs&quot; were not named.

Baldwin IV died in spring 1185, and was succeeded by his nephew. Raymond was &quot;bailli&quot;, but he had passed Baldwin V&#x27;s personal guardianship to Joscelin III of Edessa, his maternal great-uncle, claiming that he did not wish to attract suspicion if the child, who does not seem to have been robust, were to die. Baldwin V died during the summer of 1186, at Acre. Neither side paid any heed to Baldwin IV&#x27;s will.

After the funeral, Joscelin had Sibylla named as her brother&#x27;s successor, although she had to agree to divorce Guy, just as her father had divorced her mother, with the guarantee that she would be allowed to choose a new consort. Once crowned, she immediately crowned Guy. Meanwhile, Raymond had gone to Nablus, home of Balian and Maria, and summoned all those nobles loyal to Princess Isabella and the Ibelins. Raymond wanted instead to have her and her husband Humphrey IV of Toron crowned. However, Humphrey, whose stepfather Raynald of Châtillon was an ally of Guy, deserted him and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla.

===Houses of Aleramici and Brienne (1205–1228)===

===House of Hohenstaufen (1228–1268)===

=== House of Lusignan (1268–1291)===

===Regents===
The frequent absence or minority of monarchs required regents to be appointed many times throughout the Kingdom&#x27;s existence.

== Later claims ==

Over the years, many European rulers claimed to be the rightful heirs to the kingdom. None of these claimants, however, has actually ruled over any part of Outremer:
* Count Hugh of Brienne claimed the regency of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and indirectly, his place in the succession in 1264 as senior heir of Alice of Jerusalem, second daughter of Queen Isabella I, and Hugh I of Cyprus. Hugh, although the son of their eldest daughter, was passed over by the Haute Cour in favour of his cousin Hugh of Antioch, the future Hugh III of Cyprus and Hugh I of Jerusalem. The Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem continued, but the family had afterwards next to no part in affairs in Outremer.
* Frederick of Meissen, Landgrave of Thuringia, briefly used the title of King of Jerusalem (alongside the titles of King of Sicily and Duke of Swabia) after the death of Conradin in 1268, as grandson of Frederick II, who had crowned himself King of Jerusalem in his own right. This claim was never recognized in Outremer or elsewhere.
* After the end of the kingdom, Henry II of Cyprus continued to use the title of King of Jerusalem. After his death the title was claimed by his successors, the kings of Cyprus.
* The title was also continuously used by the Angevin kings of Naples, whose founder, Charles I of Anjou, had in 1277 bought a claim to the throne from Mary of Antioch. Thereafter, this claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem was treated as a tributary of the crown of Naples, which often changed hands by testament or conquest rather than direct inheritance. As Naples was a papal fief, the Popes often endorsed the title of King of Jerusalem as well as of Naples, and the history of these claims is that of the Neapolitan Kingdom. At the time of their dethronement, the Habsburg Emperors of Austria used the title &quot;King of Jerusalem&quot;, as did the Savoyard kings of Italy, and the title is among those claimed by Felipe VI of Spain.
* In 1948 King Abdullah I of Jordan was crowned king of Jerusalem by the Coptic bishop.

<text>The Beatles&#x27; Second Album is the second Capitol Records album by the English rock band the Beatles, and their third album released in the United States including &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;, which was issued three months earlier by Vee-Jay Records. Following its release in April 1964, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; replaced &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in the US. The album was compiled mostly from leftover tracks from the UK album &quot;With the Beatles&quot; and the forthcoming UK &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; EP, which are predominantly rock and roll and R&amp;B covers, and rounded out with several Lennon-McCartney-penned non-album b-sides and the hit single &quot;She Loves You&quot;. Among critics, it is considered the band&#x27;s purest rock and roll album and praised for its soulful takes on both contemporary black music hits and original material.

In 2004 &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; was issued for the first time on compact disc as part of &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot; boxed set. It was issued in a miniature cardboard replica of the original album sleeve containing the US mono and stereo mixes. In 2014, the album was released on CD again, individually and included in the Beatles boxed set &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;, which contained the album&#x27;s running order but with UK mixes as remastered in 2009.

An album with the same title and similar cover art but containing different songs from the US release, was issued on the EMI subsidiary label Odeon in 1964 for the Japanese market. The same cover art was used for the album &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Long Tall Sally&quot; issued by Capitol Records of Canada.

==Background and song selection==

With the massive popularity of &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; through the early part of 1964 and a desire for additional Beatles product, Capitol Records decided to compile a follow-up album as soon as possible. For this, a backlog of some 25 songs, issued by EMI in Britain and many other territories across the world from 1962 onwards, had yet to be issued by Capitol. &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; was the first album of the group&#x27;s work to be assembled by the company exclusively for the US market, &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; having been a reconfigured and shorter version of the band&#x27;s second EMI LP, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;. Despite its title, however, &quot;Second Album&quot; was in fact the third Beatles LP in the United States, since Vee-Jay Records had released &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; in January 1964. Vee-Jay had been able to issue the latter LP – which comprised most of the Beatles&#x27; EMI debut, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; – due to Capitol&#x27;s initial lack of interest in marketing the Beatles&#x27; music.

&quot;Second Album&quot; was a collection of material from various UK releases and recording sessions dating back to March 1963. Included were the five remaining tracks, all cover versions, from &quot;With the Beatles&quot;: &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;Devil in Her Heart&quot;, &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot; and &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;. Added to these were &quot;Thank You Girl&quot;, the B-side to the single &quot;From Me to You&quot;; &quot;She Loves You&quot; and its B-side, &quot;I&#x27;ll Get You&quot;; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;), from the upcoming &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; UK soundtrack; and two new songs, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; and &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;. The latter tracks would be released in June 1964 in the UK on the &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; EP.

==Mixes==

Capitol&#x27;s engineers, headed by record executive Dave Dexter, Jr., added considerable echo and reverb to the songs in order to give the album the atmosphere of a live performance. The inclusion of &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; marked the only stereo version of the song released on any album in the US or UK for over 40 years, until another stereo version was released on the 2009 remastered edition of the &quot;Past Masters&quot; compilation. The same stereo mix of &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; on &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; was included on &quot;The Beatles Beat&quot;, released in West Germany and the Netherlands, as well as the original 2004 CD issue of &quot;The Beatles Second Album&quot; as included in &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot; box set. The Capitol album mix of &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; is also unique in that it contains three additional harmonica riffs by John Lennon – two during the bridge and one at the end. For its US album debut, Capitol took this stereo version and transferred it into a two-to-one stereo-to-mono mixdown for the mono LP release, thus creating an alternative mono mix of the song. The stereo version of &quot;Money&quot; also underwent the same two-to-one stereo-to-mono mixdown, creating another alternative mono mix.

For the mono version of &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;, the cowbell comes in at the very beginning of the song; the stereo version features the cowbell after the beginning of the vocal. George Harrison&#x27;s opening 12-string guitar phrase is also different between the mono and stereo versions. On &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, reverb was added to the stereo version. The &quot;dry&quot; mono mix of &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; is noticeably different from the mono mix with a slight echo that was issued in the UK, and is unique to the &quot;Second Album&quot;. The mono version of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; is also different from the version on the UK &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; LP.

Because &quot;I&#x27;ll Get You&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; were never mixed in stereo, Duophonic/fake stereo versions were made for this album.

== Release ==
Capitol Records issued &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; on 10 April 1964 with the catalogue number Capitol ST 2080. The tagline in the advertising for the release read: &quot;It&#x27;s Here! It&#x27;s on Capitol!! and It&#x27;s ALL Beatles!!!&quot; In Canada, this record could not be called &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;, since &quot;Beatlemania! With the Beatles&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; had preceded it. A slightly different track listing was released for the Canadian market with similar cover art, under the title &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Long Tall Sally&quot;. In 1968, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;, &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; and &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; were issued in Canada, although the earlier Canadian LPs remained in print (eventually with stereo mixes) until the late 1980s, when the CD era precipitated their deletion.

In the US, the album debuted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs for the week ending April 25, 1964. It peaked at number one the following week, replacing &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot;, which had held the top spot for eleven weeks (for the last nine of which Vee-Jay&#x27;s &quot;Introducing...&quot; had placed at number two). &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; remained atop the chart for five consecutive weeks and stayed in the top 200 until May 1965. It reached 1,668,435 copies sold by 31 December 1964, and 2,051,486 copies by the end of the decade. It was certified Gold by the RIAA on 13 April 1964, and 2× Platinum on 10 January 1997.

== Critical legacy ==

&quot;Second Album&quot; was one of the first four rock albums purchased by future music critic Robert Christgau. Writing of the album in 1969, he said it disproves the fallacy among new rock scholars and listeners that the Beatles had not succeeded artistically until the more melodic period of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1965) and &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966). Instead, he argued it was their ebullient performing style, as on the &quot;Second Album&quot;″s covers of African-American rock and roll songs, which &quot;were touched with soul (compare their Money to the Beach Boys&#x27; Barbara Ann) but avoided the sodden seriousness of other white imitators.&quot; He included the album in his basic rock &quot;library&quot; of 25 albums for &quot;Stereo Review&quot; that year, and later in a more comprehensive library of essential 1950s and 1960s recordings for &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2020, Christgau voted for the album in his ballot for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s third edition of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

According to Bruce Eder of AllMusic, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot; &quot;stands as probably the best pure rock &amp; roll album ever issued of the group&#x27;s music&quot; because it &quot;avoid[s] any trace of the pop ballads favored by Paul McCartney that usually slowed down the group&#x27;s other early albums, and the result was the longest uninterrupted body of hard rock &amp; roll and R&amp;B in their entire output.&quot; In his 2014 review of the Beatles&#x27; Capitol albums, for &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Jeff Slate commented that &quot;the oomph of the over-compressed Dexter tracks&quot; had since been removed, but the album was arguably their &quot;first great rock and roll record&quot;. Referring to the assortment of tracks assembled by Capitol, Darryl Sterdan of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; wrote: &quot;The hodge-podgery begins [here] ... Surprisingly enough, it holds together OK, thanks to a strong string of rockers like Money, Roll Over Beethoven and Long Tall Sally.&quot;

<doc id="1127653" wikidata="Q1047972" url="?curid=1127653" title="Lüscher color test">
<text>The Lüscher color test is a psychological test invented by Max Lüscher in Basel, Switzerland, first published in 1947 in German and first translated to English in 1969. The simplest form of the test instructs a subject to order a series of 8 colors in order of preference. This test claims that the order of preference can reveal characteristics of the subject&#x27;s personality. The simplicity of the test has allowed it to be heavily tested.

==History==
Lüscher developed his color test during his doctoral studies at the University of Basel. He first published the idea at the first World Congress of Psychology in Lausanne in 1947 and later as his thesis in 1949, titled &quot;Color as a Psychological Means of Examination&quot;. After expanding and publishing his ideas throughout the next 2 decades, the test gained widespread popularity as it was first translated to English in the 1969 + 1971 editions.

==Methodology==
In the simple (short, or 8-color) test, as published in 1969, a subject is presented with 8 cards, each containing a color. The colors include 4 &quot;basic&quot; (blue, yellow, red, green) and &quot;auxiliary&quot; (violet, brown, grey, and black) colors. The subject is instructed to select the color that they &quot;&quot;like best&quot; or &quot;feel the most sympathy&quot;&quot; toward. This selection is performed iteratively with the remaining colors until all the colors have been ordered by preference. The order is recorded, with each color corresponding to a numerical value, 0-7.

A series of symbols are applied to the results (in pairs) to indicate the subject&#x27;s relationship to the color, where:

For each symbol, the color pair can then be analyzed individually. For example, +0+7 (a strong preference for gray and black) indicates that the subject:
Finally, a 5th pair comprising the first and last colors can be analyzed (e.g. +0-5). Each combination gives a percentage for how often it was chosen in Lüscher&#x27;s prior tests of 36,892 students. Stars are also sometimes indicated, where a high number of accumulated stars can be interpreted as a potential psychological disorder.
The test can then be repeated. If the second test run differs from the first, it is assumed that the latter is more spontaneous and therefore more authentic.

Alternatively, the full test can also be used, but this was only published by Lüscher in German and was not included as part of the initial English translations.

==Psychological basis==
Lüscher believed that sensory perception of color is objective and universally shared by all, but that color preferences are subjective, and that this distinction allows subjective states to be objectively measured by using test colors. Lüscher believed that because the color selections are guided in an unconscious manner, they reveal the person as they really are, not as they perceive themselves or would like to be perceived.

Lüscher believed that personality traits could be identified based on one&#x27;s choice of color. Therefore, subjects who select identical color combinations have similar personalities. In order to measure this, he conducted a test in which subjects were shown 8 different colored cards and asked to place them in order of preference. Colors are divided between &quot;basic&quot; (blue, yellow, red, green) and &quot;auxiliary&quot; (violet, brown, grey, and black).

After subjects placed the cards in order from most liked to least liked, they were asked to evaluate the extent to which their personalities matched the descriptive statements formed by Lüscher of each color.

The results of the Lüscher color diagnostic contain indications pertaining to personal assessment and special, professional recommendations as to how psychological stress and the resulting physical symptoms can be avoided. It also offers additional information for verbal and homeopathic therapy.

==Criticism==

The test ranks high on a published list of discredited procedures in psychology. It lacks construct validity and is considered as example of the Barnum effect, where an ostensible personality analysis (actually consisting of vague generalities applicable to the majority of people) is reported to be accurate by subjects who had completed a personality test before reviewing their &quot;results&quot;. A 1984 comparison of the Lüscher color test and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) found little agreement between the two tests, prompting the authors to urge cautious use of the former. Some still stand up for the Lüscher color test as providing high accuracy in a non-verbal test involving as few as eight colors, especially in children, even though the majority of the scientific community puts it high on discredited tests lists.

Most validation studies do not find the Lüscher color test to be meaningful, but one validation study has recommended it as a possible pre-screening for Taylor–Johnson Temperament Analysis.

The original English translation contains an extensive bibliography supporting the test. However, an analysis of the references found that many of them do not even exist.

==Applications==
The Lüscher color test has been applied to the assessment of criminality.

<text>Something New is an album by English rock band the Beatles, released in 1964 for the North American market only.

The album is the third Capitol LP release and fifth American album release overall by the band, following the United Artists release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The album includes eight songs from the original British release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, as well as the tracks &quot;Slow Down&quot; and &quot;Matchbox&quot; from the &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; EP and the German-language version of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. The mono version also featured the extended single mix of &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot;, while stereo editions included a shorter edit from the UK release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.

== Release history ==
Originally scheduled for 1 August 1964, the album was rush-released on 20 July 1964, ten days after the British release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. It was released in both mono and stereo versions. All mono mixes of the five songs duplicated from the United Artists soundtrack album are identical on both releases. &quot;Something New&quot; was the only early Capitol Beatles album to contain all tracks in true stereo. The mono release contains alternative versions of &quot;Any Time At All&quot; (a different mix during the instrumental bridge), &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot; (with the &quot;missing&quot; third verse), &quot;When I Get Home&quot; (the line &quot;Till I walk out that door again&quot; during the song&#x27;s bridge has a different vocal passage from the UK mono mix), &quot;If I Fell&quot; (Lennon&#x27;s non-double-tracked introductory vocal), and &quot;And I Love Her&quot; (McCartney&#x27;s non-double-tracked vocal).

This album was also released on the Parlophone label for sale only on American Armed Forces bases in Europe. These copies have great collector value. The album was also issued in Germany on the Odeon label. The German stereo version contains a reprocessed stereo version of &quot;Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand&quot; and an extended version of &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, repeating the closing riff six times instead of four. This mix was later released on the US version of &quot;Rarities&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;Something New&quot; was released for the first time on CD as part of &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot; box set (catalogue number CDP 7243 8 66876 2 3) containing the US mixes for both mono and stereo. In 2014, the album was released on CD again, both individually, and included in the boxed set &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;, which contained the album&#x27;s running order but with UK mixes as remastered in 2009.

== Reception ==

The album spent nine weeks at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in 1964, behind the United Artists &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; album.

&quot;Something New&quot; was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

==Track listing==

<text>Mauricio Rodrigo Solís Mora (born 13 December 1972) is a former Costa Rican professional footballer who played in the two positions of midfielder and defender. He represented Costa Rica at two FIFA World Cups.

==Club career==
Solís began his professional career with Herediano, making his debut with the club on 5 November 1990 against Limonense. He would remain with Herediano until 1996, winning the last Costa Rican championship Herediano won in the 1992–93 season.

He then moved to England, signing a contract with Derby County along with compatriot Paulo Wanchope. His stay there was short, however, and he returned to CONCACAF in 1998, playing with Comunicaciones of Guatemala for a year. Solís then moved to Major League Soccer, where he played parts of the 1999 and 2000 seasons for the San Jose Clash (later San Jose Earthquakes), registering 4 goals and 1 assist in 29 starts.

After two years in MLS, Solís returned to Costa Rica, where he signed a contract with Alajuelense. He played two seasons with the team, winning championships in 2000–01 and 2001–02, before looking overseas again, signing a contract with Greek club OFI Crete to join fellow &quot;Tico&quot; Rónald Gómez. After a year with them, Solís again returned to America, playing the 2003–04 season in Mexico for Irapuato, after being brought to the team by former coach Alexandre Guimarães, then rejoined Alajuelense and in summer 2005 returned to Comunicaciones to play alongside compatriots Rolando Fonseca, Ricardo González and Jhonny Cubero.

===Herediano return===
In 2007, he transferred to Maccabi Netanya but his contract was terminated after preseason for certain complications so he came back to Costa Rica and decide to sign up for the teams he started his career Herediano. In March 2010 he became the 7th player to reach 300 matches for &quot;Los Florenses&quot;.

In April 2010, shortly after Herediano finish its participation in Costa Rican 2010 summer Championship, he announced his retirement from football. However, he reversed that decision when he joined Ricardo González and coach Paulo Wanchope at ambitious second division side Uruguay de Coronado in February 2011. He retired 5 months later.

==International career==
Solís made his debut for Costa Rica in a September 1993 friendly match against Saudi Arabia and earned a total of 110 caps, scoring 6 goals. He represented his country in 30 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at both the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. He also played at the 1995, 1999 and 2001 UNCAF Nations Cups as well as at the 2002 and 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cups. He also played at the 1997 and 2001 Copa América.

Solís was the second Costa Rican behind Luis Marín to reach 100 caps in June 2005 against Guatemala.

His final international was a June 2006 FIFA World Cup match against Poland.

<doc id="1127664" wikidata="Q3109650" url="?curid=1127664" title="Peggy Ryan">
<text>Margaret O&#x27;Rene Ryan (August 28, 1924 – October 30, 2004) was an American dancer and actress, best known for starring in a series of movie musicals at Universal Pictures with Donald O&#x27;Connor and Gloria Jean.

== Career ==
Ryan joined her parents&#x27; vaudeville act, &quot;The Merry Dancing Ryans&quot;, before she was 3 years old, and appeared in her first film, &quot;Wedding of Jack and Jill&quot; (1929) when she was 4. She attended Hollywood Professional School.

Her singing, acting, and dancing skills were noticed by song-and-dance actor George Murphy, who helped her get a role in 1937&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Town&quot;. However, her entry in the book &quot;Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America, Volume 1&quot; notes, &quot;[B]y then she was outgrowing the kiddie parts, yet not old enough for the teenage roles.&quot;

She continued working in small roles until 1942, when she had a solo number in the feature film &quot;What&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;?&quot;. The Gloria Jean-Donald O&#x27;Connor-Peggy Ryan team were a great hit with audiences and exhibitors, and the three teens made five features together. Her screen character in these films was usually brash, wisecracking, and boy-crazy. In 1944, Ryan advanced to more elaborate productions, in support of Jack Oakie and Abbott and Costello.

She left Universal in 1945 and married James Cross that same year; they were divorced in 1952. She returned to the screen with dancer Ray McDonald for 1949&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Heart&quot; and &quot;Shamrock Hill&quot;, and 1953&#x27;s &quot;All Ashore&quot;. They wed in 1953 and toured together in a nightclub act before being divorced in 1957. Her third marriage, in 1958, was to Hawaii columnist Eddie Sherman, following which she left movies for choreography and semiretirement. Sherman adopted her two children from her previous marriages.

On television, Ryan played a recurring role as secretary Jenny Sherman in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; from 1969–76.

In later years, she trained Las Vegas showgirls in tap dancing. Her last public performance, at her 80th birthday party, was a hilarious song-and-dance routine for her former Universal studio colleagues. She continued to teach tap until two days before her death.

==Death==
Ryan died at age 80, following two strokes. Her ashes were scattered under the Hollywood sign in Hollywood, California.

<text>Edward Ralph Kienholz (October 23, 1927 – June 10, 1994) was an American installation artist and assemblage sculptor whose work was highly critical of aspects of modern life. From 1972 onwards, he assembled much of his artwork in close collaboration with his artistic partner and fifth wife, Nancy Reddin Kienholz. Throughout much of their career, the work of the Kienholzes was more appreciated in Europe than in their native United States, though American museums have featured their art more prominently since the 1990s.

Art critic Brian Sewell called Edward Kienholz &quot;the least known, most neglected and forgotten American artist of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s Beat Generation of the 1950s, a contemporary of the writers Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Norman Mailer, his visual imagery at least as grim, gritty, sordid and depressing as their literary vocabulary&quot;.

==Early life==

Edward Ralph Kienholz was born in Fairfield, Washington, in the dry eastern part of the state. He grew up on a wheat farm, learning carpentry, drafting, and mechanical skills. His father was strict, and his mother was a religious fundamentalist; the rebellious son longed to escape this constricted environment. He studied art at Eastern Washington College of Education and briefly, at Whitworth College in Spokane, but did not receive any formal degree. After a series of odd jobs, working as an orderly in a psychiatric hospital, manager of a dance band, used car salesman, caterer, decorator, and vacuum cleaner salesman, Kienholz settled in Los Angeles, where he became involved with the avant-garde art scene of the day.

==Artistic development==
In 1956, Kienholz opened the NOW Gallery, for which Michael Bowen designed the sign; that year he met grad student Walter Hopps, who owned the Syndell Gallery. They co-organized the All-City Art Festival, then in 1957, with poet Bob Alexander, they opened the Ferus Gallery on North La Cienega Boulevard. The Ferus Gallery soon became a focus of avant garde art and culture in the Los Angeles area.

Despite his lack of formal artistic training, Kienholz began to employ his mechanical and carpentry skills in making collage paintings and reliefs assembled from materials salvaged from the alleys and sidewalks of the city. In 1958 he sold his share of the Ferus Gallery to buy a Los Angeles house and studio and to concentrate on his art, creating free-standing, large-scale environmental tableaux. He continued to participate in activities at the Ferus Gallery, mounting a show of his first assemblage works in 1959.

In 1961, Kienholz completed his first large-scale installation, &quot;Roxy&#x27;s&quot;, a room-sized environment which he showed at the Ferus Gallery in 1962. Set in the year 1943, &quot;Roxy&#x27;s&quot; depicts Kienholz&#x27;s memories of his youthful encounters in a Nevada brothel complete with antique furniture, a 30s era jukebox, vintage sundries, and satirical characters assembled from castoff pieces of junk. This artwork later caused a stir at the documenta 4 exhibition in 1968.

A 1966 show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) drew considerable controversy over his assemblage, &quot;Back Seat Dodge ‘38&quot; (1964). The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors called it &quot;revolting, pornographic and blasphemous&quot;, and threatened to withhold financing for the museum unless the tableau was removed from view. A compromise was reached under which the sculpture&#x27;s car door would remain closed and guarded, to be opened only on the request of a museum patron who was over 18, and only if no children were present in the gallery. The uproar led to more than 200 people lining up to see the work the day the show opened. Ever since, &quot;Back Seat Dodge ’38&quot; has drawn crowds. LACMA did not formally acquire the work until 1986.

In 1966, Kienholz began to spend summers in Hope, Idaho, while still maintaining studio space in Los Angeles. Also around that time, he produced a series of &quot;Concept Tableaux&quot;, which consisted of framed text descriptions of artwork that did not yet exist. He would sell these works of early Conceptual Art (though the term was not in widespread use at the time) for a modest sum, giving the buyer the right (upon payment of a larger fee) to have Kienholz actually construct the artwork. He sold a number of &quot;Concept Tableaux&quot;, but only &quot;The State Hospital&quot; progressed to a completed artwork.

Kienholz&#x27;s assemblages of found objects—the detritus of modern existence, often including figures cast from life—are at times vulgar, brutal, and gruesome, confronting the viewer with questions about human existence and the inhumanity of twentieth-century society. Regarding found materials he said, in 1977, &quot;I really begin to understand any society by going through its junk stores and flea markets. It is a form of education and historical orientation for me. I can see the results of ideas in what is thrown away by a culture.&quot;

Kienholz occasionally incorporated defunct or operating radios or televisions into their works, sometimes adding sound and moving images to the overall effect. Live animals were selectively included as crucial elements in some installations, providing motion and sound that contrasted starkly with frozen tableaus of decay and degradation. For example, &quot;The Wait&quot;, a dismal scene of a lonely skeletal woman surrounded by memories and waiting for death, incorporates a cage with a live parakeet cheerfully chirping and hopping about. The bird is considered an integral part of the installation, but requires special attention to ensure that it remains healthy and active, as described in the Whitney Museum&#x27;s online catalog and video. Another well-known work, &quot;The State Hospital&quot;, incorporates a pair of black goldfish swimming in each of two glass goldfish bowls representing the head of an inmate suffering with mental illness.

Kienholz&#x27;s work commented on racism, aging, mental illness, sexual stereotypes, poverty, greed, corruption, imperialism, patriotism, religion, alienation, and most of all, moral hypocrisy. Because of their satirical and antiestablishment tones, their works have often been linked to the funk art movement based in San Francisco in the 1960s.

Although he was an atheist and despised feigned religiosity, Keinholz carefully preserved an anonymous store window shrine discovered in Spokane, Washington. Calling this found outsider artwork &quot;The Jesus Corner&quot;, Keinholz exhibited it in a Spokane museum in 1984, and then showed it at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Ten years later, Keinholz insisted on selling it at a reduced price to the Missoula Art Museum in Missoula, Montana, to ensure that it would be on view in an environment he felt comfortable with.

==Collaboration with Nancy Reddin (1972–1994)==

In 1981, Ed Kienholz officially declared that all his work from 1972 on should be retrospectively understood to be co-authored by, and co-signed by, his fifth wife and collaborator, former photojournalist Nancy Reddin Kienholz. Collectively, they are referred to as &quot;Kienholz&quot;. Their work has been widely acclaimed, particularly in Europe.

In the early 1970s, Kienholz received a grant that permitted him to work in Berlin. His most important works during this period were based on the &quot;Volksempfängers&quot; (fixed-channel radio receiving apparatus from the National Socialist period in Germany). In 1973 he was guest artist of the German Academic Exchange Service in Berlin. In 1974 Edward Kienholz performed with Jannis Kounellis, Wolf Vostell, and other artists in Berlin at the &quot;ADA - Aktionen der Avantgarde&quot;.

In 1973, Kienholz and Reddin moved from Los Angeles to Hope, Idaho, and for the next twenty years they divided their time between Berlin and Idaho. In 1976 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1977 he opened &quot;The Faith and Charity in Hope Gallery&quot; at their Idaho studio, and showed both established and emerging artists, including Francis Bacon, Jasper Johns, Peter Shelton, and Robert Helm. The Keinholzs continued to produce their own new installations and sculptures for exhibition.

==Death==
Edward Kienholz died suddenly in Idaho on June 10, 1994, from a heart attack after hiking in the mountains near their home. He was a chronic smoker who had been struggling with diabetes, which progressively impaired use of his extremities. He was buried in an authentic Kienholz installation; Robert Hughes wrote, &quot;[H]is corpulent, embalmed body was wedged into the front seat of a brown 1940 Packard coupe. There was a dollar and a deck of cards in his pocket, a bottle of 1931 Chianti beside him and the ashes of his dog Smash in the back. He was set for the afterlife. To the whine of bagpipes, the Packard, steered by his widow Nancy Reddin Kienholz, rolled like a funeral barge into the big hole.&quot;

After Edward&#x27;s death, Nancy Reddin Kienholz continued to administer their joint artistic estate, organizing shows and exhibitions, until her own death in 2019.

==Exhibitions==

Retrospectives of Kienholz&#x27;s work have been infrequent, due to the difficulty and expense of assembling fragile, literally room-sized sculptures and installations from widely dispersed collections around the world. Kienholz work has often been difficult to view, both because of its subject matter, and the logistics of displaying it.

Relatively few of the major works had been on display in the US, the Kienholzes&#x27; native land, though American museums have now started to feature their work more prominently, especially after a major retrospective () exhibition in 1996 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Bowers Museum (Santa Ana, California), the Dayton Art Institute, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art (Washington, DC), the Oakland Museum of California, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the University of Arizona Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York) are among the public collections holding work by Kienholz.

The diverse and freely improvised materials and methods used in Kienholz works pose an unusual challenge to art conservators who try to preserve the artist&#x27;s original intent and appearances. Treatment of &quot;Back Seat Dodge &#x27;38&quot; for clothes moths presented an awkward situation, which was deftly addressed by the Getty Conservation Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum in behalf of LACMA, the owner of the artwork.

In 2009, the National Gallery in London mounted an exhibition of &quot;The Hoerengracht&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Whores&#x27; Canal&quot;), a 1980s streetscape installation portraying the red light district of Amsterdam, Netherlands. From May 6 to June 19, 2010, Kienholz&#x27;s &quot;Roxy&#x27;s&quot; (1960) was meticulously reconstructed and visible through the aperture of two panoramic windows at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City.

In 2011, Kienholz&#x27;s work was visited with renewed attention in Los Angeles partly as a result of the &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot; series of exhibitions, which saw his powerful 1972 installation &quot;Five Car Stud&quot; reinstalled at LACMA. The oversized installation is framed by five vehicles parked in a circle, their headlights illuminating a stark racial hatred castration scene. It was exhibited in Los Angeles and Germany in 1972, then purchased by a Japanese collector and kept in storage for almost 40 years, known only through documentary photos from those exhibitions. In September 2011, it was re-installed at LACMA. At Art Basel 2012, it was purchased by the Prada Foundation.

Kienholz&#x27;s work entitled &quot;The Jesus Corner&quot; is now on display at the Museum of Arts and Culture in Spokane, Washington.

==Legacy==
Kienholz is acknowledged as a pioneer, as early as 1960 with &quot;Roxy&#x27;s&quot;, of what came to be known as installation art and assemblage art. He also produced early works of conceptual art with his &quot;Concept Tableau&quot; series in the mid-1960s. In 1968, Ed Kienholz&#x27;s carefully documented and self-consciously outrageous behavior in what has been called the &quot;TWA Incident&quot; revealed aspects of what would later be called &quot;performance art&quot;. In spite of his claims to be merely a rough working-class carpenter and mechanic, Kienholz was well aware of his position in the contemporary art scene, and acted assertively to shape his image and legacy.

French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard&#x27;s book &quot;Pacific Wall&quot; (&quot;Le mur du pacifique&quot;) is an extended meditation on Keinholz&#x27;s &quot;Five Card Stud&quot; installation.

<doc id="1127670" wikidata="Q3015232" url="?curid=1127670" title="T.H.E. Cat">
<text>T.H.E. Cat is an American television action drama that aired on NBC Fridays from 9:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. during the 1966–1967 television season.

Robert Loggia starred as the title character, Thomas Hewitt Edward Cat. The series preceded the 1968–1970 ABC television series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, which was also about a cat burglar who uses his skills for good. &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; in that the action is backed by a memorable music score, composed by Lalo Schifrin, who did the music for &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The series was co-sponsored by R. J. Reynolds (Winston) and Lever Brothers and was created by Harry Julian Fink.

==Synopsis==
Out of the night comes a man who saves lives at the risk of his own. Once a circus performer, an aerialist who refused the net. Once a cat burglar, a master among jewel thieves. Now a professional bodyguard. Primitive... savage... in love with danger. The Cat!

The series&#x27; hero is a reformed thief who had served a prison term. Of Romani heritage, Cat is cast in the mold of famed private eye Peter Gunn. Like Gunn&#x27;s waterfront bar Mother&#x27;s, Cat operates out of Casa Del Gato (House of the Cat) in San Francisco, of which he is part owner. Thomas is a master of martial arts who uses his skills to stop antagonists in his pursuit of justice for the downtrodden. He always works on the side of the law, occasionally using his skills to benefit the local police. His police contact is Police Capt. McAllister, a man with one hand. R. G. Armstrong played McAllister in 12 episodes of the series. Cat is also a master gymnast and acrobatic artist who uses his skills to gain entry to places from which the police are barred by law.

==Ratings and mid-season changes==
The series was test-marketed during the summer of 1966 and did well, so NBC expected it to have high ratings. However viewership was disappointing, and few teenagers watched the program. 

After sixteen episodes were completed the series took a two-week filming break so that star Robert Loggia could go on an eight-city publicity tour to explain his character, T. Hewitt Edward Cat, and the writers could make changes they hoped would appeal to more teens. Loggia stated people had told him the series was too &quot;arty&quot; and they didn’t understand the concept. He had also been told that the &quot;mysterious&quot; character was too mysterious, and viewers didn’t know enough about him. When the series resumed production the character of Captain McAllister was eliminated, as many viewers didn’t like seeing Cat being close to a policeman. The changes didn’t help viewership, and the series was cancelled after one season.

<doc id="1127684" wikidata="Q1286914" url="?curid=1127684" title="Polar ice cap">
<text>A polar ice cap or polar cap is a high-latitude region of a planet, dwarf planet, or natural satellite that is covered in ice.

There are no requirements with respect to size or composition for a body of ice to be termed a polar ice cap, nor any geological requirement for it to be over land, but only that it must be a body of solid phase matter in the polar region. This causes the term &quot;polar ice cap&quot; to be something of a misnomer, as the term ice cap itself is applied more narrowly to bodies that are over land, and cover less than 50,000 km2: larger bodies are referred to as ice sheets.

The composition of the ice will vary. For example, Earth&#x27;s polar caps are mainly water ice, whereas Mars&#x27;s polar ice caps are a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and water ice.

Polar ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy in the form of solar radiation from the Sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.

Earth&#x27;s polar caps have changed dramatically over the last 12,000 years. Seasonal variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the Sun. Additionally, in geologic time scales, the ice caps may grow or shrink due to climate change.

==Earth==

===North Polar ice cap melting===

Earth&#x27;s North Pole is covered by floating pack ice (sea ice) over the Arctic Ocean. Portions of the ice that do not melt seasonally can get very thick, up to 3–4 meters thick over large areas, with ridges up to 20 meters thick. One-year ice is usually about 1 meter thick. The area covered by sea ice ranges between 9 and 12 million km2. In addition, the Greenland ice sheet covers about 1.71 million km2 and contains about 2.6 million km3 of ice. When the ice breaks off (calves) it forms icebergs scattered around the northern Atlantic.

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, &quot;since 1979, winter Arctic ice extent has decreased about 4.2 percent per decade&quot;. Both 2008 and 2009 had a minimum Arctic sea ice extent somewhat above that of 2007. At other times of the year the ice extent is still sometimes near the 1979–2000 average, as in April 2010, by the data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Still, between these same years, the overall average ice coverage appears to have declined from 8 million km2 to 5 million km2.

===South Pole===
Earth&#x27;s south polar land mass, Antarctica, is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet. It covers an area of about 14.6 million km2 and contains between 25 and 30 million km3 of ice. Around 70% of the fresh water on Earth is contained in this ice sheet.

Data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that the sea ice coverage of Antarctica has a slightly positive trend over the last three decades (1979–2009).

===Historical cases===
Over the past several decades, Earth&#x27;s polar ice caps have gained significant attention because of the alarming decrease in land and sea ice. NASA reports that since the late 1970s, the Arctic has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometres) of sea ice per year while the Antarctic has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900 km2) of sea ice per year. At the same time, the Arctic has been losing around 50 cubic kilometres (gigatons) of land ice per year, almost entirely from Greenland&#x27;s 2.6 million gigaton sheet. On 19 September 2014, for the first time since 1979, Antarctic sea ice extent exceeded 7.72 million square miles (20 million square kilometres), according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The ice extent stayed above this benchmark extent for several days. The average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.23 million square miles (18.72 million square kilometres). The single-day maximum extent in 2014 was reached on 20 Sep, according to NSIDC data, when the sea ice covered 7.78 million square miles (20.14 million square kilometres). The 2014 five-day average maximum was reached on 22 Sep, when sea ice covered 7.76 million square miles (20.11 million square kilometres), according to NSIDC. This increase could be due to the reduction in the salinity of the Antarctic Ocean as a result of the previous melting of the ice sheet, by increasing the freezing point of the seawater.

The current rate of decline of the ice caps has caused many investigations and discoveries on glacier dynamics and their influence on the world&#x27;s climate. In the early 1950s, scientists and engineers from the US Army began drilling into polar ice caps for geological insight. These studies resulted in &quot;nearly forty years of research experience and achievements in deep polar ice core drillings... and established the fundamental drilling technology for retrieving deep ice cores for climatologic archives.&quot; Polar ice caps have been used to track current climate patterns but also patterns over the past several thousands years from the traces of and found trapped in the ice. In the past decade, polar ice caps have shown their most rapid decline in size with no true sign of recovery. Josefino Comiso, a senior research scientist at NASA, found that the &quot;rate of warming in the Arctic over the last 20 years is eight times the rate of warming over the last 100 years.&quot; In September 2012, sea ice reached its smallest size ever. Journalist John Vidal stated that sea ice is &quot;700,000 sq km below the previous minimum of 4.17m sq km set in 2007&quot;. In August 2013, Arctic sea ice extent averaged 6.09m km2, which represents 1.13 million km2 below the 1981–2010 average for that month.

==Mars==
In addition to Earth, the planet Mars also has polar ice caps. They consist of primarily water-ice with a few percent dust. Frozen carbon dioxide makes up a small permanent portion of the Planum Australe or the South Polar Layered Deposits. In both hemispheres a seasonal carbon dioxide frost deposits in the winter and sublimates during the spring.

Data collected in 2001 from NASA missions to Mars show that the southern residual ice cap undergoes sublimation inter-annually. The most widely accepted explanation is that fluctuations in the planet&#x27;s orbit are causing the changes.

==Pluto==
On 29 April 2015, NASA stated that its New Horizons missions had discovered a feature thought to be a polar ice cap on the dwarf planet Pluto. The probe&#x27;s flyby of Pluto in July 2015 allowed the &quot;Alice&quot; ultraviolet imaging spectrometer to confirm that the feature was in fact an ice cap composed of methane and nitrogen ices.

<doc id="1127688" wikidata="Q1200465" url="?curid=1127688" title="The Minister's Black Veil">
<text>&quot;The Minister&#x27;s Black Veil&quot; is a short story written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was first published in the 1836 edition of &quot;The Token and Atlantic Souvenir&quot;, edited by Samuel Goodrich. It later appeared in &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;, a collection of short stories by Hawthorne published in 1837.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with the sexton standing in front of the meeting-house, ringing the bell. He is to stop ringing the bell when the Reverend Mr. Hooper comes into sight. However, the congregation is met with an unusual sight: Mr. Hooper is wearing a black semi-transparent veil that obscures all of his face but his mouth and chin from view. This creates a stir among the townspeople, who begin to speculate about his veil and its significance.
As he takes the pulpit, Mr. Hooper&#x27;s sermon is on secret sin and is &quot;tinged, rather more darkly than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper&#x27;s temperament&quot;. This topic concerns the congregation who fear for their own secret sins as well as their minister&#x27;s new appearance. After the sermon, a funeral is held for a young lady of the town who has died. Mr. Hooper stays for the funeral and continues to wear his now more appropriate veil. It is said that if the veil were to blow away, he might be &quot;fearful of her glance&quot;. Mr. Hooper says a few prayers and the body is carried away. Two of the mourners say that they have had a fancy that &quot;the minister and the maiden&#x27;s spirit were walking hand in hand&quot;. That night another occasion arises, this time a joyous one—a wedding. However, Mr. Hooper arrives in his veil again, bringing the atmosphere of the wedding down to gloom.

By the next day, even the local children are talking of the strange change that seems to have come over their minister. Yet, no one is able to ask Mr. Hooper directly about the veil, except for his fiancée Elizabeth. Elizabeth tries to be cheerful and have him take it off. He will not do so, even when they are alone together, nor will he tell her why he wears the veil. Eventually, she gives up and tells him goodbye, breaking off the engagement.

The one positive benefit of the veil is that Mr. Hooper becomes a more efficient clergyman, gaining many converts who feel that they too are behind the black veil with him. Dying sinners call out for him alone. Mr. Hooper lives his life thus, though he is promoted to &quot;Father&quot;, until his death. According to the text, &quot;All through life the black veil had hung between him and the world: it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman&#x27;s love, and kept him in that saddest of all prisons, his own heart; and still it lay upon his face, as if to deepen the gloom of his dark-some chamber, and shade him from the sunshine of eternity&quot;.

Even though Elizabeth broke off their engagement, she never marries and still keeps track of the happenings of Hooper&#x27;s life from afar. When she finds out that he is deathly ill she comes to his death bed to be by his side. Elizabeth and the Reverend ask him once again to remove the veil, but he refuses. As he dies, those around him tremble. He tells them in anger not to tremble, not merely for him but for themselves, for they all wear black veils. Father Hooper is buried with the black veil on his face.

==Development and publication history==
Hawthorne may have been inspired by a true event. A clergyman named Joseph Moody of York, Maine, nicknamed &quot;Handkerchief Moody&quot;, accidentally killed a friend when he was a young man and wore a black veil from the man&#x27;s funeral until his own death.

The story was published as &quot;The Minister&#x27;s Black Veil, a Parable&quot; and credited &quot;by the author of Sights from a Steeple&quot; in &quot;The Token and Atlantic Souvenir&quot; for 1836; the issue also included Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The May-Pole of Merry Mount&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Knell&quot;. It was later included in the collection &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;.

==Analysis==

Like many of Hawthorne&#x27;s works, the setting of the story is a town in Puritan New England. The scene provides the backdrop for a psychological exploration of the themes of sin, repentance, and morality. Much of the story focuses on the acrimonious reaction of the congregation to the seemingly benign veil. Hawthorne uses their reaction as a critique of the Puritan image of original sin, using the veil as a representation not of &quot;secret sin&quot; but the inherent sinful nature of all people.

The story is both allegorical and didactic. The main themes are hidden sin and underlying guilt, with Hooper&#x27;s method of preaching being to wear his sin on his face in a literal way. The townspeople grow uncomfortable with him because they start to become aware of their own sin. Hawthorne keeps the motive of the veil unknown to the reader. But the interpretation of the story generally rests on some moral assessment or explanation of the minister&#x27;s symbolic self-veiling. Literary critic Edgar Allan Poe proposed that the issue of the minister&#x27;s self-veiling was a mystery conceived to be solved or inferred by the reader. While Poe proposed this, Hawthorne never lets the reader know the reasoning behind the veil. While the veil is the main symbol in the story, it is also ironic. Hooper, in his stubborn use of the veil parable of one sin, is unconsciously guilty of a greater sin: that of egotistically warping the total meaning of life. In addition to standing for a man&#x27;s concealment or hypocrisy and for Hooper&#x27;s own sin of pride with its isolating effects, it stands also for the hidden quality of second sin. Hawthorne&#x27;s use of ambiguity can be portrayed in many different ways: the manipulation of setting, manipulation of lighting and effects, and the use of an unreliable narrator to weave a shocking story that could or could not be likely. The narrator&#x27;s credibility tends to be questionable because it is not a direct source. In using a third-person narrator, the minister&#x27;s motives are never solidified, which keeps up the suspense.

&quot;Hidden nature of guilt&quot;: Hooper arouses in a sermon the notion of secret sin and the sad mysteries in which we hide from our nearest and dearest. Hooper acknowledges the problem of sin, the guilt that is admitted openly, and the guilt of sin that is repressed or hidden from the world. When the Reverend Hooper makes the people aware of the darkness within his being, he dissolves the barrier between his repugnant, repressed self and his conscious self. This barrier is characterized by the veil, which is transferred into the expression of hidden guilt. Hooper, in the story, announces to the congregation at his bedside that everyone wears a black veil; he implies that everyone has some form of secret guilt.

&quot;Communion of sinners&quot;: Hooper leads the townspeople in realizing that everyone shares sin no matter how much they try to avoid facing it. All people sin and it is up to them whether they face their sin or ignore it. Hooper tries to teach a lesson. In content, the lesson may be very much like the sermon on &quot;secret sin&quot; Hooper was scheduled to teach, but the townspeople are uncomfortable with the medium. The veil is something they have to see every day, rather than a sermon just once or twice a week.

&quot;Morality&quot;: Hawthorne&#x27;s use of Hooper&#x27;s veil teaches that whether we face it or not, we all sin and must accept what we have done, because judgment will come for everyone. Hooper decides to represent hidden sin and guilt in a literal way to reach out to his followers.

John H. Timmerman notes that because of Hawthorne&#x27;s writing style Hooper&#x27;s insistent use of the black veil, Hooper stands as one of his arch-villains. This is from Hooper&#x27;s act of separating himself from the rest of humanity and denying his love for Elizabeth in favor of the veil.

===Symbols===
The black veil is a symbol of secret sin and how terrible human nature can be. This could represent the secret sin that all people carry in their hearts, or it could be a representation of Mr. Hooper&#x27;s specific sin, which some readers think to be adultery. Hooper as Everyman bearing his lonely fate in order to portray a tragic truth; and there is the implicit one of human imbalance, with Hooper&#x27;s actions out of all proportion to need or benefit. Edgar Allan Poe speculated that Minister Hooper may have committed adultery with the lady who died at the beginning of the story, because this is the first day he begins to wear the veil, &quot;and that a crime of dark dye, (having reference to the young lady) has been committed, is a point which only minds congenial with that of the author will perceive.&quot; Minister Hooper also seems to be unable to tell his fiancée why he wears the veil due to a promise he has made, and is not willing to show his face to the lady even in death. Finally, two funeral attendees see a vision of him walking hand in hand with the girl&#x27;s spirit.

In a different view, the black veil could represent the Puritan obsession with sin and sinfulness. Puritans held beliefs of predestination and that only &quot;God&#x27;s elect&quot; will be saved when the day of judgement comes, and this weeding out process of finding the saved versus not saved was a large part of Puritan life. The reaction to the minister&#x27;s veil is one of annoyance and fear, &quot;&#x27;I don&#x27;t like it,&#x27; muttered an old woman, as she hobbled into the meetinghouse. &#x27;He has changed himself into something awful, only by hiding his face.&#x27;&quot; We are given no clues in the story up to this point as to how or why or when the minister came to have the black veil over his face, it is just there, and as far as we are told the minister is doing nothing different from his normal routine. The one and only difference is a simple veil covering his face and the way his congregation thinks about him now. This is Hawthorne criticizing the overly judgmental nature of the Puritans belief on sin, for them sin was an undeniable mistake, &quot;Hooper need not have committed any specific sin; for the hardened Puritan, his humanity was sinful enough, and he wore it the way the medieval penitent would his hair shirt. Anything less than absolute perfection was absolute corruption&quot;

On the next page following the old woman&#x27;s quote Hawthorne uses the narrator to point out what the congregation is really feeling on the inside, even though their outward reaction displays something entirely different, &quot;A subtle power was breathed in his words. Each member of the congregation, the most innocent girl, and the most hardened of breast, felt as if the preacher had crept upon them, behind his awful veil, and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought.&quot; This &quot;iniquity of deed or thought&quot; seems to hark back to the Spanish inquisition (hence the use of iniquity) and suggests the Puritan congregation is starting to realize their own faults: that being the overly harsh judgement they put on the minister and anyone else for superstitious things such as a black veil. The fear ultimately draws from the congregation&#x27;s thoughts over being saved or not being saved. They sound loud and proud in being critical of the minister for his veil, but they are clearly weak and not confident inside their own minds about their personal salvation, so the harsh judgement of others could possibly be seen as a way to relieve themselves for a people were never sure about whether they were really going to heaven.

==Critical response==
When the story was published in &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;, an anonymous reviewer in the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot; for March 10, 1837, noted that he preferred &quot;the grace and sweetness of such papers as &#x27;Little Annie&#x27;s Ramble,&#x27; or &#x27;A Rill from the Town-pump,&#x27; to those of a more ambitious cast, and in which the page glows with a wider and more fearful interest, like &#x27;The Minister&#x27;s Black Veil&#x27; and &#x27;Dr. Heidegger&#x27;s Experiment.&#x27;&quot; Edgar Allan Poe offered a few critiques of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s tales. Hawthorne received a mixed review from Poe, who writes that &quot;high imaginations gleam from every page&quot;. He notes, however, that versatility is lacking in Hawthorne&#x27;s tone and character development. Poe claims that Hawthorne is a man of &quot;truest genius&quot; but needs to work on subject areas of his writing. In his review of &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;, Poe also reveals a disdain for allegory, a tool which Hawthorne uses extensively.

==Legacy and adaptations==
Reverend Hooper&#x27;s sermon in the short story was the launching point of the dramatic work &quot;The Minister&#x27;s Black Veil&quot; by Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio (2016), directed by Romeo Castellucci, with Willem Dafoe as Reverend Hooper, text by Claudia Castellucci and original music and sound design by Scott Gibbons.

<text>Beatles &#x27;65 is an album by the English rock band the Beatles that was issued in the United States and Canada in December 1964. Released as the North American alternative to &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, it was the band&#x27;s fifth studio album culled by Capitol Records in the US from the Beatles&#x27; EMI releases. The LP was also issued in West Germany on the Odeon label.

In 2004, &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot; was released on CD for the first time as part of &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot; box set. In 2014, the album was reissued on CD, both individually and as part of the box set &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;, using the UK mixes as remastered in 2009.

==Music==
&quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot; includes eight of the fourteen songs from &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;. It also includes &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, which was cut from the US version of the &quot;Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; album, and both sides of the single &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; / &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;. The latter two songs were issued in &quot;duophonic&quot; stereo and included added reverb by Capitol Records&#x27; executive Dave Dexter, Jr. to cover up the use of the mono mixes sent from the UK. Other than &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, which was recorded on , the Beatles recorded all of its songs between 11August and at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.

Two of the three songs written by Carl Perkins and recorded by the Beatles appear on this album. The six &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; tracks omitted from the album were issued by Capitol on &quot;Beatles VI&quot; in June 1965.

==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot; jumped from number 98 straight to number 1, making the biggest jump to the top position in the history of the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts up to that time. It remained at number 1 for nine straight weeks from 9 January 1965. The album was the top selling non-soundtrack LP based on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end chart for 1965. By 31 December 1964, the album had sold 1,967,261 copies in the US; by the end of the 1960s, sales there were up to 2,327,186.

Writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; (1983), John Swenson described &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot; as the first of the band&#x27;s &quot;classic &#x27;concept&#x27; albums&quot;. He said that the LP &quot;worked as a musical whole&quot; rather than merely serving as a collection of &quot;the latest bunch of songs that could be assembled into a record in any order&quot;. Several albums were released and promoted in America during 1965 sporting a similar title to &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot;. These included &quot;Sinatra &#x27;65&quot; by Frank Sinatra and &quot;Ellington &#x27;65&quot; by Duke Ellington on Reprise Records, and &quot;Brasil &#x27;65&quot; by Sérgio Mendes on the Beatles&#x27; own Capitol label.

<doc id="1127701" wikidata="Q74317" url="?curid=1127701" title="James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran">
<text>James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran (1537–1609) was a Scottish nobleman and soldier who opposed the French-dominated regency during the Scottish Reformation. He was the eldest son of James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, sometime regent of Scotland. He was of royal descent, and at times was third or fourth in succession to the Scottish crown; several royal marriages were proposed for him, but he eventually never married. He went to France with Mary, Queen of Scots, where he commanded the Scots Guards. After returning to Scotland, he became a leader of the Protestant party against Mary and her French supporters. However, he went insane in 1562 and was confined for the rest of his life.

== Birth and origins ==
James Hamilton may have been born in 1537 or 1538, another source suggests a date in 1532. His place of birth probably was Hamilton, Lanarkshire. He was the eldest son of James Hamilton and his wife Lady Margaret Douglas. His father was the 2nd Earl of Arran and was created Duke of Châtellerault in France in 1548. His father also was the grandson of Mary, eldest daughter of James II and was at this time, after King James V, the most senior, legitimate male descendant of King James II and, so heir presumptive for much of King James V&#x27;s reign and the future 3rd Earl of Arran was next in succession after him. His father&#x27;s family descended from Walter FitzGilbert, the founder of the House of Hamilton, who had received the barony of Cadzow from Robert the Bruce.

James&#x27;s, mother, Lady Margaret Douglas, was the daughter of James Douglas, 3rd Earl of Morton. She descended from James IV through an illegitimate daughter, and Joan, daughter of James I. Both parents were Scottish. They had married in September 1532.











In 1542, James and his father were displaced in the royal succession by the birth of James V&#x27;s daughter, Mary (the future Mary, Queen of Scots) - until James V died only six days later. James&#x27;s father became regent for the baby queen.

== Regent Arran&#x27;s marriage plans ==
The Regent proposed various royal marriages for his son, who was second in line for the crown.

In March 1543, James V&#x27;s widow, Mary of Guise told the English ambassador Ralph Sadler that the Regent &quot;mindeth to marry&quot; her daughter Queen Mary to his son, something she was anxious to avoid. In December 1543, French envoys heard that the Regent wanted to marry James to Henry VIII of England&#x27;s daughter Lady Elizabeth (later Elizabeth I). This may have been offered by Henry himself as a price of the Regent&#x27;s allegiance, but nothing came of the proposal either. Henry wanted to marry the baby queen to his son Edward. The Regent was a Protestant, and initially supported this in public, despite widespread opposition in Scotland.

Then in 1543 the Regent became Catholic and joined the pro-French faction of Cardinal Beaton. Henry responded with the &quot;Rough Wooing&quot;, nine years of war to make Scotland accept the English marriage. In October 1544, James was taken to St Andrews Castle, where he was Cardinal Beaton&#x27;s guest and a pledge for the alliance of the Regent and the Cardinal.

The Regent still wanted to marry Mary to James. His half-brother, John, Abbot of Paisley, met with Lord Somerville and the Earl of Angus on 28 October 1545, to get their support. Somerville&#x27;s son John wrote to Mary of Guise that they would not be persuaded. Alexander Crichton of Brunstane and a diplomat in France, Johannes Sturm, also sent warnings of this marriage proposal to England. Sturm realised the marriage would hinder Anglo-French peace treaty negotiations. James remained in the Cardinal&#x27;s custody. In February 1546 he was sent a book of Latin exercises and a copy of &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;.

In 1546, a Protestant band seized St Andrews Castle and murdered the Cardinal. James was held prisoner and hostage. The Regent besieged St Andrews; the Protestants offered to give James to Henry VIII, in return for the help of an English fleet. Henry VIII was willing, but never actually sent the fleet. On 14 August 1546, the Parliament of Scotland excluded James from the royal succession (he was then third) for the duration of his captivity. Despite Henry&#x27;s promises, the castle was finally taken with the help of French ships.

Regent Arran now agreed to the marriage of Mary to the Dauphin Francis, son and heir of King Henry II of France, confirmed by the Treaty of Haddington. For arranging the marriage of Mary and Francis, the Regent was made Duke of Châtellerault, and James succeeded him as Earl of Arran. He would not inherit the French title, his father having forfeited it in 1559.

== In France ==
Queen Mary was sent to France in August 1548. James Hamilton went with her or shortly earlier in July. Though only a boy of 16 or younger, he was appointed captain of the royal &quot;Garde Écossaise&quot; (Scots Guard), and in 1557 distinguished himself in the defence of St. Quentin. 

James was admired in France. In 1549, the &quot;Emblemata&quot;, a collection of illustrated Latin proverbs and mottos compiled by Italian jurist Andrea Alciato appeared in a new French edition. The &quot;Emblemes D&#x27;Alciat&quot; was dedicated to him. One of Arran&#x27;s personal devices was a heart pierced with an arrow pointing down.

On 24 January 1553, the French royal armourer Bénédict Claye received an order for a suit of armour for James, to be delivered before 8 April 1553. The armour was decorated with engraved and gilded borders, and included a morion, a bourguignon, and accessories.

In April 1548, Henry II offered Françoise, daughter of the Duke of Montpensier, as a bride for Arran. Later, after Mary was betrothed to the Dauphin, a number of ladies of the court were suggested as brides for James. One was Mademoiselle de Bouillon, daughter of Henry II and his mistress Diane de Poitiers, in May 1557. Others suggested brides included Claude de Rieux, Louise de Rieux (who married René, Marquis of Elbeuf), and Jeane de Savoie. But James did not marry.

== Queen Elizabeth ==
James&#x27; father gave up the Regency of Scotland in 1554, and thereafter followed a pro-English policy. It has been suggested that James was imprisoned in France as a Protestant in 1557–1558. In 1558, Châtellerault proposed the marriage of James to Queen Elizabeth I of England to cement an Anglo-Scottish alliance. This proposal was supported by John Knox, the leading Protestant cleric in Scotland, and by John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury. The marriage project gained the support of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Bishop Jewel remained in favour of the marriage as late as June 1560, and Elizabeth&#x27;s own opinion is not known.

In 1559, Châtellerault and James openly declared themselves Protestants. James returned to Scotland escorted by English diplomat Thomas Randolph and was met by Ralph Sadler in Scotland. Both of these diplomats considered themselves his friends, and in their official correspondence during the conflicts of the Scottish Reformation, they noted signs of mental instability. On 8 December 1560, Elizabeth declared her rejection of his marriage proposal to the Scottish ambassadors William Maitland, the Earl of Morton and the Earl of Glencairn. A later chronicler, David Hume of Godscroft, believed the marriage proposal was &quot;so unprobable, and such a proposition as Morton knew would not be very acceptable to her,&quot; but it was mooted by the Parliament of Scotland.

== Journey of Monsieur de Beaufort ==
At the end of May 1559, the English ambassador in Paris, Nicholas Throckmorton, discovered that Arran had declined an invitation to join festivities and tournaments at the French court. Throckmorton knew this was important, urged secrecy, and informed Elizabeth I. When it became known, in June 1559, that his father had become a Protestant , James was at his father&#x27;s French estates at Châtellerault in Poitou, perhaps at the Chateau de la Brelandiere, and became a fugitive from the French authorities. He claimed to be harvesting timber in his woodlands. Men from the &quot;Garde Écossaise&quot; were sent to Châtellerault to search for him.

James Hamilton made his way to safety in Switzerland by July, reportedly spending 15 days hiding in a wood on the way. His escape from France was masterminded by Elizabeth&#x27;s counsellor William Cecil and the English ambassador in Paris, Nicolas Throckmorton. James Hamilton went first to Geneva, then to Zurich where he was the guest of Peter Martyr, and then to Lausanne. Hamilton met Thomas Randolph &quot;alias&quot; Barnaby in Lausanne. They travelled incognito to England via Flanders. In London, he stayed at Cecil&#x27;s Westminster home. James Hamilton had an interview with the Queen herself in the garden at Hampton Court.

At the end of June 1559, Throckmorton wrote to Cecil describing how James had been unkindly handled in France. After James had left some of his Scots Guards had brawled with some French soldiers. One of the French commissioners charged with his arrest tried to apologise to Mary, Queen of Scots, as he was her close relation. Throckmorton heard that Mary had denounced James as an &quot;arrant traitor,&quot; and he hoped that this news would advance pro-English policy in Scotland. Throckmorton hoped the Scottish bearer of the letter, Sandy Whytelaw, would do this, and though Whytelaw was not a friend of James&#x27;s father, he would raise support for the marriage of James and Elizabeth.

Although Elizabeth was personally sympathetic to James&#x27;s plight, for English policy the rescue was a step towards the objective of ending the Auld Alliance, knowing that on Arran&#x27;s return his father, as &quot;second person&quot; of the realm of Scotland, would become leader of the Lords of the Congregation. William Cecil acknowledged Chatelherault&#x27;s thanks for the rescue, writing on 24 August 1559, &quot;this one thing I covet, to have this isle well united in concord&quot;. 

The name used by James while travelling through England was &quot;Monsieur de Beaufort&quot;. His journey to Scotland was noted in the letters of Bishop Jewel to Peter Martyr and Henry Bullinger. In their correspondence, Arran was known by the codename &quot;Crito&quot;, Randolph as &quot;Pamphilus&quot; and Elizabeth as &quot;Glycerium&quot;. The English commander at Berwick, Sir James Croft was aware of the plan by 14 June, and Ralph Sadler&#x27;s servant Gregory Railton was sent to wait for James at Alnwick.

== Back in Scotland ==
James went first to the castle of Berwick and met the Scottish reformer, Henry Balnaves. After a midnight ride through the Cheviot Hills, at one or two o&#x27;clock in the morning of Sunday 10 September 1559, he arrived in Teviotdale, and was re-united with his father at Hamilton Palace. His younger brother, Lord David Hamilton, was not so fortunate. David, aged 15, was arrested on 17 July 1559. David was first imprisoned in the Château de Vincennes and transferred in March 1560 to the Château d&#x27;Amboise wrapped or &quot;muffled&quot; in a blanket.

== Lady Catherine Grey ==
In September 1560, Sarlabous, the French Captain of Dunbar Castle, tried to spread a rumour that Elizabeth&#x27;s council had proposed an alternative marriage plan for Arran, with the English royal heiress Lady Catherine Grey, daughter of the Duchess of Suffolk.

Arran was found to be enjoying the company of an Edinburgh merchant&#x27;s daughter and daughter-in-law of Cuthbert Ramsay, Alison Craig or Craik. She was described by Randolph as &quot;a good handsome wench&quot; in December 1561, and the interference of the Earl of Bothwell, Lord John Stewart, Prior of Coldingham, and René, Marquis of Elbeuf led to an armed stand-off. Bothwell and Lord John Stewart may have been visiting houses in the town as part of a masque.

== Valiant and Stout in the Cause ==
James joined the Lords of the Congregation and fought tirelessly against the French and Mary of Guise in the cause of the Scottish Reformation. With his cousin, Robert, Master of Maxwell, on his father&#x27;s orders, he attacked Crichton Castle the home of the Earl of Bothwell, on 10 October 1559 James and his friends took money and silverware from Daldowie and on 9 November 1559 raided the Palace of the Bishop of Dunblane, taking a gold necklace belonging to Janet, Lady Fleming, and removing the Bishop and his silver to Stirling Castle and Falkland Palace. The sixty-year-old Bishop was then imprisoned at Castle Campbell until Christmas and forced to pay for his lodging. In January 1560 Arran was leading the war in Fife, writing reports to Ralph Sadler and Sir James Croft from Dysart, Wemyss, Cupar and Aberdour.

The French ambassador in England, Gilles de Noailles, reported that the Scottish rebels had told Queen Elizabeth that if they were victorious Arran would become King of Scotland by consent of Scottish lords with England as its superior kingdom. Scotland would pay England an annual fee and Elizabeth would add the arms of Scotland to her heraldry. A later English document of 1583 represents the possibility that the Scottish nobility were intent on making Arran King of Scotland, because of their dissatisfaction with Mary and her French links. The nobles were &quot;fullie resolved to have deprived her of her government, and established the same in the eldest sonne of the Duke of Chatteleroy, the Erle of Arreyne, beinge then a gent of verie great hope and towardnes&quot;.

In January 1560, at the request of Scottish Protestants, Elizabeth sent a fleet to Scotland under the command of William Wynter. It consisted of 17 large ships belonging to the Queen, carrying a total of 3,000 men; part of the fleet was tasked with intercepting supplies from France to starve French troops in Scotland. At the end of January, Arran conferred with the English Admiral William Wynter at Burntisland, saying he was about to return to his father&#x27;s lands in the West. By 4 February 1560, Fife was won over to the Congregation and pacified. Later in February, Thomas Randolph posed as a Scot to gain the confidence of a French agent at Dumbarton Castle but Arran clumsily revealed his identity.

The centre of the conflict in Scotland moved to the Siege of Leith. An English army came to the rebels&#x27; support, arranged by the elder Arran in the Treaty of Berwick (1560). Before the English army arrived, the French raided Glasgow and attacked the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, Arran shadowed their return to Leith with 800 horse. He then joined the besiegers in the camp at Restalrig. On 4 March he met the Earl of Huntly, who seemed likely to join the Congregation, at Perth. He retired from the camp at Leith by 10 April, &quot;evil at ease,&quot; to rest at Holyrood. Within a week, Arran was in control of Blackness Castle, and returned to Edinburgh for the peace negotiations after the death of Mary of Guise in June, which led to the Treaty of Edinburgh. After the Protestant religion was established by the Reformation Parliament, he went with Lord James to Dalhousie Castle and burnt church books and vestments.

== Mary again ==
Following the death of Mary&#x27;s husband Francis II of France in 1560, and the apparent failure of his English marriage plan of August 1560, James&#x27;s father again tried to marry his son to Mary, as first suggested in their infancy. Mary resisted such efforts.

Mary returned to Scotland in August 1561. James was chosen a member of her council on her arrival, but took up a hostile attitude to the court in consequence of the practice of the Roman Catholic religion. George Buchanan, who was unsympathetic to Mary, suggested that in November 1561, she exploited young Arran&#x27;s real affection for her by spreading a rumour that he planned to abduct her from Holyrood Palace to his residence, Kinneil House, to justify strengthening the royal bodyguard. Though James&#x27; father disputed the rumour, and Thomas Randolph&#x27;s considering with this &quot;great horlyburly without reason&quot; the Queen &quot;had never less occasion to fear, with so many papists then in the town&quot;, physical security was tightened at Holyrood.

On 17 January 1562 Arran rode from Kinneil to Linlithgow Palace to meet with Mary, Queen of Scots, and discuss how he and his father might be remunerated for their services. The queen&#x27;s half-brother, James Stewart, now Earl of Mar, married Agnes Keith on 8 February 1562. Arran escorted Mary to the feasts on Shrove Tuesday at Holyrood Palace, but became ill before the triumphs or masques on the following days. A few days later it was said that Arran had spoken &quot;irreverently&quot; of Elizabeth, the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Majesty&quot;, and Randolph offered his opinion to the Duke that Arran had a high opinion of his own achievements, but a tendency to fail to reciprocate well-wishers, and ought to have thanked those who favoured his suite of marriage to Elizabeth. Randolph found this flaw in his behaviour &quot;strange&quot;. Arran now wondered if he had been better off in France serving in the Royal Guard, and spent eight days in bed in Edinburgh, tormented in his imaginations.

On 28 February 1562, fearing for Arran&#x27;s mental health, Randolph wrote that he &quot;is so drowned in dreams, and so feed himself with fantasies, that either men fear that he will fall into some dangerous and incurable sickness, or play one day some mad part that will bring himself to mischief&quot;.

Arran had a mistress in Edinburgh, Alison Craik, who stayed in the house of a merchant Cuthbert Ramsay on the High Street. Bothwell, John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham, and the Marquis of Elbeuf, broke into the house to annoy Arran. They were wearing masks.

== Long twilight ==
The strain of all this activity caused a mental breakdown. At Easter 1562, his father confined him to his bedchamber at Kinneil House. Arran escaped using a rope made from his bedsheets, and made his way across the Forth to Hallyards Castle and then to Falkland Palace. He accused his enemy the Earl of Bothwell of conspiring to abduct Queen Mary, and spoke strangely of witches and devils, and &quot;fearing that all men round about came to kill him&quot;. He said that Margaret Erskine, mother of the queen&#x27;s half-brother Lord James Stewart was a witch. He was judged insane and confined for the rest of his life. George Buchanan, who thought the abduction plot was real and Arran a hero, said Arran was imprisoned first at St Andrews Castle, then at Edinburgh Castle where Bothwell was also held. Randolph wrote to Arran&#x27;s old ally Throckmorton that the Earls had fallen into a &quot;cesspit of their own making.&quot; The Duke was forced to resign the keeping of Dumbarton Castle.

Arran&#x27;s expenses at Edinburgh Castle, where he was kept by the Earl of Mar, were paid by Mary, Queen of Scots, from her income known as the &quot;Thirds of Benefices&quot;. The cost was 40 shillings daily amounting to £732 Scots for a year. An account of his household expenses was kept by two of Mar&#x27;s servants, the chaplain Andrew Hagy and Jerome Bowie. Randolph described Arran in a letter to Cecil in January 1564, saying he inclined to solitariness, in dark rooms, with little company or talk, and was suspicious of all he met. He was also troubled with jaundice. He ate little, and spent most of his time in bed, without getting sound sleep. His father came to Edinburgh in January 1565 to ask Mary for his release. She visited Arran in the castle and kissed him, but he spoke few words as an apology to ask for forgiveness, and remained a prisoner. Arran was released in April 1566 and went to Hamilton, sick and without the power of speech. He was to remain within four miles of Hamilton Castle.

His father died at Hamilton on 22 January 1575. He inherited his father&#x27;s estate, but because of his insanity, he was placed under the care of his brother John. John and his other brother Claude, Abbot of Paisley kept Arran prisoner at Craignethan Castle, and though Henry Killigrew reported in August 1575 that if he were well-used and at liberty there was hope of recovery, he was never again allowed any freedom.

His mother, Margaret Douglas, and aunts Elizabeth Douglas (the wife of Regent Morton) and Janet or Beatrix Douglas wife of Lord Maxwell, his sister Anne (mother of the Earl of Huntly), and youngest brother David were all also affected by mental ill-health. Thomas Randolph wrote that Arran &quot;has twice before been in the same case,&quot; and his mother and aunts were &quot;certain times or the most part of the year distempered with an unquiet humour.&quot; Randolph&#x27;s description of Arran&#x27;s symptoms sound akin to modern diagnoses of mania and bipolar disorder although details of his psychological condition will remain unknown.

John and Claud were supporters of Mary Queen of Scots, and so in May 1579 the former Regent Morton seized Hamilton and Craignethan on the pretence of rescuing James from his imprisonment. John and Claud fled to England, but Arran, his mother, and Lord David were taken to Linlithgow, and his estates were taken over by the government. In 1581 his Earldom was taken by James Stewart (died 1595), but restored in 1585 along with his estates. Little is recorded of James in these later years: he died in 1609. and, as he was unmarried, his title passed to his nephew James, 2nd marquess.

<text>José Giral y Pereira (22 October 1879 – 23 December 1962) was a Spanish politician, who served as the 75th Prime Minister of Spain during the Second Spanish Republic.

==Life==
Giral was born in Santiago de Cuba. He had degrees in Chemistry and Pharmacy from the University of Madrid. In 1905 he became professor of chemistry in the University of Salamanca. He founded Acción Republicana with Manuel Azaña. During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera he conspired against the regime, and was imprisoned three times. When the Second Republic was declared, he was named director of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and advisor of State. Between 1931 and 1933 he served as Minister of the Navy.

After the failure of Diego Martínez Barrio to form a government to restrain the military revolt of 17 July 1936, Azaña ordered Giral to form a new government constituted exclusively by republicans. Giral&#x27;s government lasted from 19 July to 4 September 1936. Then, with the fall of Talavera de la Reina and the Army of Morocco within reach of Madrid, Giral was forced to cede power to Francisco Largo Caballero.

After the end of the Spanish Civil War he went to France, then to Mexico. In 1945 he succeeded Juan Negrín as prime minister of the Spanish Republican government in Exile until 1947.

He died in Mexico.

He married María Luisa González y de la Calle.

==Cabinet==

<text>Shannon Faulkner is an American teacher, best known for being the first female student to attend The Citadel in 1994, following a lawsuit. She currently teaches English in Greenville, South Carolina.

== Biography ==
Faulkner was born in Powdersville, South Carolina, United States, and graduated from Wren High School in January 1993. Faulkner was frustrated that The Citadel would not allow women. Faulkner became the first woman to attempt to enter the Corps of Cadets at The Citadel, which previously had a male-only admissions policy. Her application to the school was accompanied with having her gender blanked out of her high school transcripts. Faulkner enrolled after a successful lawsuit, &quot;Faulkner v. Jones et al.&quot;, against the military academy. The suit alleged that the Citadel, which received state money, was &quot;denying her equal protection under the Constitution&quot;. Her lawyer, Val Vojdik, said, &quot;We are seeking educational opportunity... We are seeking equal access to a public program we pay for.&quot;

The Citadel allowed Faulkner to attend classes in January 1994 as a civilian student, which meant she had to be off campus by the time retreat was played. She was not allowed to reside in the barracks nor wear the cadet&#x27;s uniform.

Faulkner matriculated into The Citadel with an otherwise all-male corps of cadets on August 15, 1995 under the escort of United States Marshals. The school established that only five male cadets would be authorized to speak to her; anyone else risked disciplinary action. The following day, which was the first day of &quot;Hell Week&quot;, the area was hit by 100-degree weather. A black flag was hoisted, which warned of the heat and signaled that cadets were to drink water frequently. At lunch, the cadets were forced to eat large quantities of a noodle casserole, and Faulkner began feeling ill. After vomiting, Faulkner reported that she felt nauseous to Ray Gerber, her cadreman who was one of the five cadets authorized to speak to her. Gerber escorted Faulkner and four male cadets, who were also suffering from heat-stress to the infirmary. She rejoined the corps two hours later. Concerned about the soupy weather in the 100s, the commandant&#x27;s office decreed that there were to be no outdoor activities until the heat moved on. Despite all exercises taking place inside a climate-controlled gymnasium, Faulkner still continued to be nauseated. She then returned to the infirmary, where she spent the remainder of that week before washing out, citing emotional and psychological abuse and physical exhaustion. Faulkner was one of thirty cadets to drop out. When her withdrawal from the Citadel was announced, upperclassmen celebrated their return to an all-male school, with one cadreman leading the recruits in an altered marching song of &quot;Marching down the avenue. Now we know that Faulkner&#x27;s through. I am happy and so are you!&quot;. She told Oprah Winfrey on her show that she had gained weight during the court trials due to the stress she was facing.

Two decades later, in a 2012 interview with the &quot;Post and Courier&quot; newspaper, Faulkner said that what precipitated her leaving so abruptly was a threat to kill her parents by a person present when she entered. Her parents&#x27; home was vandalized. In 1999, she told the Associated Press, &quot;I went into it knowing I may not get anything out of it. I was doing it for the next woman.&quot;

Writer Pat Conroy paid for Faulkner&#x27;s education after she left the Citadel, and she became a middle school teacher in South Carolina. Faulkner attended Furman University and later Anderson College, where she graduated in 1999 with a degree in secondary education. After graduating she was hired by Carolina High School.

==In popular culture==

*Lisa Simpson&#x27;s experience in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; 8th-season finale, &quot;The Secret War of Lisa Simpson&quot; (1997) was partly inspired by Faulkner.

<text>The Ahousaht Wildside Heritage Trail is a hiking trail on Flores Island, British Columbia, Canada in Ahousaht Traditional Territories that connects the town of Ahousat, the village of Marktosis, to several beaches and wild forest and is long one way ending in Cow Bay. The trail features signage at locations important to the Ahousat people; further information about each location of importance is shared in a guidebook published by Elder Stanley Sam. 

The trail began as a First Nations women&#x27;s ecotourism initiative to secure steady jobs and income for the people of the Ahousaht First Nation and was created by manual labour in 1993. The trail office was re-opened in 2010 as a non-profit operation dedicated to job creation within the Ahousat community, as well as ongoing stewardship by Ahousat of lands used by their people for thousands of years.

<text>South Asian English, informally Desi English or Subcontinental English, refers to English dialects spoken in most modern-day South Asian countries, inherited from British English dialect. Also known as Anglo-Indian English during the British Raj, the English language was introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the early 17th century and reinforced by the long rule of the British Empire. Today it is spoken as a second language by about 350 million people, 20% of the total population.

Although it is fairly homogeneous across the subcontinent, sharing &quot;linguistic features and tendencies at virtually all linguistic levels&quot;, there are some differences based on various regional factors.

South Asian English is sometimes just called &quot;Indian English&quot;, as British India included most of modern-day South Asia (except Afghanistan). But today, the varieties of English are officially divided according to the modern states:

* Bangladeshi English
* Indian English
* Maldivian English
* Nepalese English
* Pakistani English
* Sri Lankan English

<text>The General Electric J79 is an axial-flow turbojet engine built for use in a variety of fighter and bomber aircraft and a supersonic cruise missile. The J79 was produced by General Electric Aircraft Engines in the United States, and under license by several other companies worldwide. Among its major uses was the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, Convair B-58 Hustler, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, North American A-5 Vigilante and IAI Kfir.

A commercial version, designated the CJ805, powered the Convair 880, while an aft-turbofan derivative, the CJ805-23, powered the Convair 990 airliners and a single Sud Aviation Caravelle intended to demonstrate to the U.S. market the benefits of a bypass engine over the existing Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet.

In 1959 the gas generator of the J79 was developed as a stationary 10 MW-class () free-turbine turboshaft engine for naval power, power generation, and industrial use, called the LM1500. Its first application was in the research hydrofoil .

==Development==
===Evolution of the variable stator compressor===

By the late 1940s, jet engine design had progressed to the point where further progress was limited by the performance of its compressor, in particular the pressure ratio of the compressor had to be increased to reduce the engine fuel consumption. However, the useful operating range of the compressor was limited at that time and centered around its design condition which is at a high compressor speed for take-off or cruise. If designed for high efficiency at high speeds it was very inefficient and prone to stall at low speeds.

In 1944 the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics had tested a theory for &quot;Extending the useful operating range of axial-flow compressors by use of adjustable stator blades&quot; by running an eight-stage axial compressor with pressure ratio 3.42:1 and adjustable blade angles. Considerable improvement in efficiencies were obtained at compressor speeds appreciably below the design speed.

Departures of velocity from the design condition are most noticeable in the first stages at low rpm and become more so as the design pressure ratio is increased leading to blade stall and compressor surging as happened with the Rolls-Royce Avon compressor, with design pressure ratio of 6.3:1 in 1949. In 1947 Geoff Wilde, a Rolls-Royce compressor designer, had applied for a patent &quot;Axial flow compressor regulation&quot; &quot;to provide a compressor with a wide speed-range of operation&quot;. An experimental 12-stage compressor was built with the inlet guide vanes and first four rows of stator blades adjustable to lower the air incidence angles while running at low speed. It was very effective in overcoming the stall and surge. However, a simpler mechanical-design solution (variable inlet guide vanes and bleed) had already been shown to work with the required design pressure ratio so variable stators were not used in a Rolls-Royce engine until the 1980s (IAE V2500).

By 1950 General Electric was focussing on supersonic engines with variable stators as a result of design studies which compared them with dual-rotor types. Based on their past experience at that time, and estimation of the development effort required to prove new technologies, variable stators promised the best way of designing the compressor for the high required pressure ratio of 12:1. This pressure ratio was needed to achieve the supersonic performance, subsonic cruise performance and low weight necessary for future supersonic aircraft.

In 1951, a General Electric team led by Gerhard Neumann, at that time in charge of engine development testing, was given funding to build a test compressor with variable stators. In addition, the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division lead, C.W. &#x27;Jim&#x27; LaPierre, formed two teams to do design studies for an engine that could run for extended periods at Mach 2.0 while still giving good fuel economy while cruising at Mach 0.9. Neumann led a team using a variable stator configuration, while Chapman Walker led a parallel effort using two-spools. After a years study the engine with variable stators was chosen as it was lighter, simpler and had a smaller diameter. A demonstrator engine with variable stators, the GOL-1590, predecessor to the J79 was built. At the same time a new engine, the X-24A, was designed for a supersonic aircraft and selected by the Air Force. Development of the new engine was supported by running the GOL-1590 demonstrator engine.

===General===

GE won the Air Force contract for a new engine with approximately , with afterburning, to power a new supersonic bomber, which became the Convair B-58 Hustler. The two other engines offered by GE, an advanced version of the existing J73 and a much larger design, known as the J77, were both cancelled. The first prototype of the production version, XJ-79, ran on 8 June 1954.

The first flight of the engine was on 20 May 1955 with the engine installed in a General Electric J47-powered North American B-45C Tornado &quot;(&quot;serial 48-009&quot;)&quot;. In flight the J79 was lowered from the bomb bay into the airstream for testing. The first flight after the 50-hour qualification test, required for a new engine that is the sole source of thrust for a flying testbed, was on 8 December 1955, powering the second pre-production Douglas F4D Skyray, with the J79 in place of its original Westinghouse J40 engine as part of the General Electric development and qualification program. The YF-104 was the next airplane to fly with the J79 followed by a re-engined Grumman F11F Tiger in a Navy-sponsored program to gain experience with the engine before the first flight of the F4H (F-4).

The J79 was used on the F-104 Starfighter, B-58 Hustler, F-4 Phantom II, A-5 Vigilante, IAI Kfir aircraft and the SSM-N-9 Regulus II supersonic cruise missile. It was produced for more than 30 years. Over 17,000 J79s were built in the US, and under license in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Japan. A downgraded version of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon with a J79 was proposed as a low-cost fighter for export, and though a prototype aircraft was flown, it found no customers.

The J79 was replaced by the late 1960s in new fighter designs by afterburning turbofans such as the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 used in the F-111 and F-14, and newer generation turbofans with the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 used in the F-15 Eagle which give better cruise fuel efficiency by-passing air around the core of the engine.

For their part in designing the J79, Gerhard Neumann and Neil Burgess of General Electric Aircraft Engines were jointly awarded the Collier Trophy in 1958, also sharing the honor with Clarence Johnson (Lockheed F-104) and the US Air Force (Flight Records).

==Design==

The compressor blades and vanes are made of 403 stainless steel, except for the -3B and -7A variants, which have A286 vanes at stages 7 through 17. The compressor rotor is made of Lapelloy, B5F5 and titanium. 
The J79 makes a particular howling sound at certain throttle settings. This strange feature led to the NASA operated F-104B Starfighter, &quot;N819NA&quot;, being named &quot;Howling Howland&quot;. Early engines also produced noticeable quantities of smoke, especially at mid-throttle/cruise settings, a disadvantage in combat aircraft making them vulnerable to visual detection. Later models were redesigned to be &quot;smokeless&quot;.

The turboshaft counterpart to the J79 is the General Electric LM1500, used for land and marine applications. Many J79-derived engines have found uses as gas turbine power generators in remote locations, in applications such as powering pipelines.

The J79 has two commercial derivatives: CJ805-3 (a non-afterburning engine, fitted with thrust reverser and sound suppressor), and the CJ805-23 (with a free-wheeling aft fan and thrust reverser) fitted to the Convair CV-880 and the Convair CV-990 respectively.

J79 engines may be started using compressed air directly on the engine turbine blades or by using a turbine starter attached to the accessory gearbox. The gas used in this starter is either compressed air or from a solid propellant cartridge.

<doc id="1127749" wikidata="Q560541" url="?curid=1127749" title="Tommaso Landolfi">
<text>Tommaso Landolfi (9 August 1908 – 8 July 1979) was an Italian writer, translator and literary critic. His numerous grotesque tales and novels, sometimes on the border of speculative fiction, science fiction and realism, place him in a unique and unorthodox position among Italian writers. He won a number of awards, including the prestigious Strega Prize.

==Life==

He was born in Pico, now in the province of Frosinone (then in province of Terra di Lavoro, the roughly modern-day province of Caserta), to a noble family. In 1932, he graduated in Russian language and literature at the University of Florence. During his time in Florence, he worked on various magazines including &quot;Letteratura&quot; and &quot;Campo di Marte&quot;. He later worked on other magazines and newspapers including &quot;Oggi&quot;, &quot;Il Mondo&quot; and &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;.

He focused his translation efforts on Russian and German authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.

He spent much of his life in Rome and at the family home at Pico, as well as the gaming houses of Sanremo and Venice, where he was an avid gambler. He died in Rome.

He was an atheist.

==Writings==
Landolfi is a writer of rare stylistic power. His originality lies principally in his ability to incorporate his wide knowledge of European literature into his Italian inheritance, with a poet&#x27;s (and translator&#x27;s) close concern with language. His work reveals the clear influence of writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and Gogol. Susan Sontag saw him as something of a cross between Borges and Isak Dinesen, but thought him probably better than either. Landolfi constantly strives to enrich his own style, drawing on obscure or even archaic formulations and at times creating his own languages. In an almost Pirandellian fashion, Landolfi is constantly haunted by the unresolved conflict between art and life.

He wrote a number of short stories and novels, poetry and theatrical pieces, the early work being in general the most significant, particularly the works of his so-called &#x27;youthful maturity&#x27;, the collection of short stories &quot;Dialogo dei massimi sistemi&quot; (1937).

&quot;La pietra lunare&quot; (1939), his first novel, opens on a grotesque and almost hallucinatory scene of &#x27;provincial life&#x27; from which the main character, Giovancarlo, is possessed by Gurù, the goat-girl, who allures him through a realm of phantasmagorical horror into the bowels of the earth and an erotic initiation. The world seems divided between two opposing realities, between the misery of everyday life and another strange and marvellous world.

&quot;Racconto d&#x27;autunno&quot; (1947) is his best-known work outside Italy. Its story is, in more ways than one, a metaphor for an end to the old and the beginning of the new. While ghosts, terror and war dominate the landscape, and a gothic horror story is the main plot, there is nonetheless a sense that this book is a lamentation on an epoch that came to a violent end during World War II.

&quot;Cancroregina&quot; (1950) is a strange science-fiction story, in the form of a diary written by a man who is stuck in orbit in outer space and cannot return to Earth.

&quot;A caso&quot;, a collection of short stories, won him the Strega Prize in 1975.

In 1996 his daughter Idolina founded the &quot;Centro Studi Landolfiani&quot;.

<doc id="1127759" wikidata="Q6962831" url="?curid=1127759" title="Nancy Mace">
<text>Nancy Ruth Mace (born December 4, 1977) is an American politician who has been the U.S. representative for South Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district since 2021. She is a member of the Republican Party.

In 1999, she became the first woman to graduate from the Corps of Cadets program at the Citadel Military College of South Carolina, which was led at the time by her father, Emory Mace, the Commandant of Cadets. From 2018 to 2020, she represented the 99th district in the South Carolina House of Representatives, covering Hanahan, northeast Mount Pleasant, and Daniel Island. In 2020, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first Republican woman elected to Congress from South Carolina.

Mace worked for Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, but strongly condemned his actions surrounding the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack. She asserted that Trump&#x27;s legacy had been &quot;wiped out&quot; and that he should be held &quot;accountable&quot; for his actions. She later voted against impeaching him, and, in 2024, endorsed him in the Republican presidential primary.

==Early life, education, and career==
Mace was born at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to United States Army brigadier general James Emory Mace and schoolteacher Anne Mace. James Emory Mace was described as The Citadel&#x27;s &quot;most decorated alumnus&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. He served as commandant of cadets at The Citadel from 1997 to 2005. In 1999, she became the first woman to graduate from The Citadel&#x27;s Corps of Cadets program, receiving a degree in business administration. She wrote &quot;In the Company of Men: A Woman at The Citadel&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001) about the experience.

She earned a master&#x27;s degree in journalism and mass communication from the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia.

In 2008, she started a public relations and consulting firm called The Mace Group.

She became co-owner of the website FITSNews, which she began working for in 2007, but sold her stake in 2013. The site covers South Carolina politics and current events.

==Early political career==

In 2012, Mace volunteered for the campaign of presidential candidate Ron Paul.

In August 2013, she announced her candidacy in the 2014 election for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in South Carolina. She received 19,560 votes (6.2% of the vote) in the primary election on June 10, 2014, behind Lindsey Graham (56.4%), Lee Bright (15.4%), Richard Cash (8.3%), and Det Bowers (7.3%).

She supported Donald Trump for president in 2016 as a coalitions director and field director for the campaign.

==South Carolina House of Representatives==
===Elections===

==== 2017 special ====
On September 18, 2017, Mace filed as a Republican to run in a special election for the South Carolina State House District 99 seat being vacated by Jimmy Merrill, who resigned earlier that month after an indictment and plea deal for several ethics violations. She received 49.5% of the vote in the November 14 Republican primary, 13 votes short of winning the nomination outright. She defeated the second-place finisher, Mount Pleasant town councilman Mark Smith, in the November 28 runoff, 63–37%.

Mace defeated Democrat Cindy Boatwright in the January 16, 2018, general election, 2,066 votes to 1,587 (57–43%). She took office on January 23, 2018.

==== 2018 ====
Mace defeated the Democratic nominee, Mount Pleasant resident Jen Gibson, in the November 6, 2018, general election.

===Tenure===
In 2019, Mace successfully advocated for the inclusion of exceptions for rape and incest in a bill for a six-week abortion ban that passed the South Carolina state house. In a speech on the state house floor, Mace revealed that she had been raped at age 16. She has said she opposes abortion but does not believe the government has the right to deny the procedure to a victim of rape or incest.

Mace co-sponsored a bill to oppose offshore drilling off South Carolina&#x27;s coast. She opposed President Donald Trump&#x27;s plan to offer oil drilling leases off South Carolina beaches.

The Conservation Voters of South Carolina gave Mace a 100% Lifetime rating for her voting record against offshore drilling and seismic testing. The South Carolina Club for Growth gave Mace its 2019 Tax Payer Hero Award.

In May 2020, Governor Henry McMaster signed Mace&#x27;s prison reform bill, which ends the shackling of pregnant women in prison, into law.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===

==== 2020 ====

In June 2019, Mace announced that she would seek the Republican nomination for South Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district, centered in Charleston, and at the time represented by Democrat Joe Cunningham. Cunningham won the seat in 2018 in a surprise victory, winning a district Trump had carried by 13 percentage points two years earlier. Mace faced Mount Pleasant city councilwoman Kathy Landing and &quot;Bikers for Trump&quot; founder Chris Cox in the June 9 Republican primary. During her primary campaign, she ran an advertisement stating she would &quot;help President Trump take care of our veterans&quot;, and in which Vice President Mike Pence called her &quot;an extraordinary American with an extraordinary lifetime of accomplishments—past, present and future.&quot; She won the primary with 57.5% of the vote.

Mace focused her campaign on banning offshore drilling off South Carolina&#x27;s coast and restoring South Carolina&#x27;s low country&#x27;s economy.

Mace claimed Joe Cunningham was seeking trans equality in the Marine Corps which she claimed would shut down Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island.

In the November general election, Mace defeated Cunningham. She assumed office on January 3, 2021.

==== 2022 ====

Mace did not vote to impeach President Trump, but she criticized him for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. As a consequence, Trump endorsed former South Carolina representative Katie Arrington in the 2022 Republican primary for Mace&#x27;s congressional seat. Mace defeated Arrington.

In the November general election, Mace defeated Democratic nominee Annie Andrews by 14 percentage points.

=== Tenure ===

==== Relationship to Donald Trump ====
Mace was one of seven Republicans who publicly refused to support their colleagues&#x27; efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election on January 6, 2021. These seven signed a letter that, while giving credence to Trump&#x27;s allegations of electoral fraud, said Congress did not have the authority to influence the election&#x27;s outcome. Mace was so concerned by the hostile atmosphere Trump was generating in the District of Columbia that she sent her children home to South Carolina before the congressional vote to accept the Electoral College votes.

After the 2021 United States Capitol attack, Mace pleaded with Trump to condemn it. While locked down in her Capitol office she told CBS News&#x27; &quot;Red &amp; Blue&quot; host Elaine Quijano, &quot;I&#x27;m begging the president to get off Twitter.&quot; Ultimately Mace voted against impeaching Trump, however, stating that due process had not been properly followed. She would later come to Trump&#x27;s defense after he was indicted for mishandling classified documents.

In 2024, Mace endorsed Trump in the 2024 Republican primaries over Nikki Haley, who supported Mace in the 2022 primary.

==== Relationship to other lawmakers ====
In November 2021, Mace criticized fellow Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert for her anti-Muslim comments about Democrat Ilhan Omar.

On October 3, 2023, Mace voted in favor of removing McCarthy, a fellow Republican, from his position as speaker of the House. According to Mace, &quot;McCarthy did not follow through on pushing her legislation to address the country&#x27;s rape-kit backlog, expand access to birth control, adopt a balanced budget amendment and create an alert system that would notify people when there is a mass shooting&quot;. McCarthy, who had been a strong ally of Mace&#x27;s, denied her claims. Following his ouster, Mace took to media, describing him as &quot;a loser&quot; who was &quot;bored and doesn’t know what to do with himself.&quot; Mace stated that she had never liked McCarthy since she joined Congress, baffling district Republicans who questioned why she had turned on her ally. Berkeley County Republican Party Chair Victoria Cowart said &quot;one of the sentiments I get the most is that she&#x27;s talking out of both sides of her mouth.&quot;

During a January 2024 hearing, Mace called Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden, &quot;the epitome of White privilege.&quot;

==== Legislation ====
Mace, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

On May 18, 2021, Mace joined 61 other House Republicans to vote against the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which condemned acts of hate against Asian-Americans and streamlined data collection and reporting about such occurrences. The bill previously passed the U.S. Senate on a 94–1 vote. Mace said she opposed the bill because it did not address discrimination against Asian-Americans in higher education.

In February 2023, Mace, along with representatives Randy Weber (), Lizzie Fletcher (), Abigail Spanberger (), Don Davis (), and Anna Eshoo (), introduced the Reinvesting in Shoreline Economies and Ecosystems Act, which aims to share federal offshore wind power revenue with states for coastal protection and restoration work. The bill was also introduced in the Senate.

On October 2, 2023, the House of Representatives passed a cybersecurity bill titled the MACE Act, intended to modernize federal cybersecurity job requirements. The bill was introduced by Mace and would be the last bill passed under Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Mace&#x27;s legislative staff named the bill after her as a joke about Mace&#x27;s ego.

In April 2024, Mace introduced the Preventing Animal Abuse and Waste Act (i.e. the PAAW Act). The bill &quot;prevents the National Institute of Health (NIH) from conducting or supporting any research that causes significant pain and distress to dogs and cats.&quot; It also &quot;requires reports to Congress by the NIH and Government Accountability Office detailing NIH-funded dog and cat experiments, their cost and assessments of NIH efforts to phase them out.&quot;

==== Former staff and focus on media attention ====
Many former congressional staffers for Mace have described her approach to her office as focused on gaining media attention. Her staffers have attributed many of her political actions, such as her vote against McCarthy, to a desire to make headlines and appear on TV programs. Staffers recalled her attempting to attract attention to herself during the January 6 Capitol attack by risking her own safety and seeking to be assaulted by rioters. Mace&#x27;s former communications director described a resolution introduced by Mace to limit usage of House of Representatives bathrooms to those designated for one&#x27;s biological sex, in response to the election of a transgender member, as a ploy for media attention. Legislative staffers for Mace described her efforts to attract media attention as hampering her legislative agenda and working relationships with other members of Congress. 

An internal staff handbook written by Mace showcased an unusual focus on public image and media attention, with strenuous expectations for communications staff. Mace&#x27;s handbook required communications staffers to book her on national TV outlets at least 1-3 times a day, and on local TV channels at least 6 times per week. The handbook was conspicuously more detailed in its descriptions of communications staff compared to legislative and constituent-focused staff positions. Mace&#x27;s office experienced high levels of turnover, including a complete turnover of all staff between November 2023 and February 2024.

==== Arrest of James McIntyre ====

In December 2024, Mace said that foster youth activist and children&#x27;s advocate James McIntyre threatened and physically assaulted her during a handshake at a foster care youth advocacy event. McIntyre was subsequently arrested by U.S. Capitol Police on charges of assaulting a government official and was jailed overnight. In court documents, Mace stated that McIntyre &quot;began to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a hand shaking motion,&quot; with &quot;her arm flailing for about 3-5 seconds.&quot; According to Mace, McIntyre had said, &quot;Trans youth deserve advocacy,&quot; and Mace described herself as being &quot;in shock&quot; and &quot;intimidated&quot;. At least three witnesses disputed Mace&#x27;s description of the handshake, saying they saw nothing but a &quot;routine handshake&quot;. Another witness stated that McIntyre &quot;took her hand with both of his hands and shook her arm up and down in an exaggerated, aggressive handshaking motion&quot;. Mace refused paramedics&#x27; assistance, but stated in court documents that she felt &quot;pain in her wrists, arm and armpit/shoulder due to the incident&quot;.

=== Redistricting ===
South Carolina redrew its congressional map after the 2020 census showed significant population changes between districts. A three-judge federal panel ruled in 2023 that Mace&#x27;s congressional District 1 was redrawn in a &quot;stark racial gerrymander&quot; intended to suppress the power of Black voters. The redistricting moved 62% of Black Charleston County voters (a total of 30,000) from Mace&#x27;s District 1 to District 6, represented by Jim Clyburn, a Black Democrat who has held the seat for 30 years, and moved inland white voters into Mace&#x27;s District 1.

The NAACP challenged the map, but after hearing oral arguments in October 2023, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court&#x27;s ruling in a 6–3 decision in May 2024, finding that the legislature&#x27;s redistricting decisions were driven by partisan goals, specifically to increase District 1&#x27;s Republican vote share, rather than by race. The Court emphasized that while race and partisan preference are highly correlated in South Carolina, the use of political data for partisan aims is not constitutionally prohibited even if it results in racial disparities. The Court also noted that the plaintiff&#x27;s decision not to provide an alternative map was an &quot;implicit concession&quot; that it could not draw one that would prove racial discrimination while achieving the same partisan outcome. The dissenting justices argued that the majority&#x27;s approach would make it significantly harder to challenge racial gerrymandering in the future. In response to the ruling, Mace stated, &quot;It reaffirms everything everyone in South Carolina already knows, which is that the line wasn&#x27;t based on race.&quot;

=== Congressional oversight ===
==== Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) ====
As Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, Mace has led congressional hearings on UAPs (also known as UFOs) and government transparency. In a July 2023 hearing, Mace questioned David Grusch, a former senior intelligence official and lead UAP analyst for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, about recovered nonhuman craft and biological remains.

In a November 2024 hearing, Mace criticized the Pentagon&#x27;s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) for being &quot;unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government&#x27;s activities concerning UAPs&quot; and questioned why the government maintains such secrecy if there is &quot;no big deal and there&#x27;s nothing there.&quot;

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on Armed Services
* Committee on Oversight and Accountability
* Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs

=== Caucus memberships ===
* Congressional Blockchain Caucus
* Climate Solutions Caucus
* Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans
* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus
* Rare Disease Caucus
* Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Caucus

== Political positions ==
=== Abortion and contraception ===
Mace has supported efforts to limit access to abortion. In 2021, she cosponsored the Life at Conception Act, which would recognize a fertilized egg as a person with equal protections under the 14th Amendment and establish a nationwide abortion ban. Describing herself as &quot;staunchly pro-life&quot;, she has also criticized abortion bans enacted in some states and called for Republicans to be more moderate on the issue, and said she would only support legislation that &quot;has exceptions of rape or incest and the life of the mother&quot;. Expounding on her views, she stated: &quot;The vast majority of people want some sort of gestational limits, ... not at nine months, but somewhere in the middle. They want exceptions for rape and incest. They want women to have access to birth control. These are all very common-sense positions that we can take and still be pro-life.&quot; Mace has voiced support for gestational limits of 15 to 20 weeks.

In 2021, Mace was among a handful of Republican representatives who did not sign onto an &quot;amicus&quot; brief to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. She criticized states enacting abortion bans without exceptions in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 2022. In an interview on &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, she said she disagreed with the recently passed abortion ban in Florida, which was signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis: &quot;Signing a six-week ban that puts women who are victims of rape and girls who are victims of incest and in a hard spot isn&#x27;t the way to change hearts and minds. It&#x27;s not compassionate. The requirements [DeSantis] has for rape victims are too much, not something that I support. It&#x27;s a non-starter. I am a victim of rape. I was raped by a classmate at the age of 16. I am very wary, and the devil is always in the details, but we&#x27;ve got to show more care and concern and compassion for women who&#x27;ve been raped. I don&#x27;t like that this bill was signed in the dead of night&quot;.

In June 2021, Mace was one of 26 Republicans to vote for the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act. In January 2023, Mace introduced the Standing with Moms Act, which would create a website, life.gov, that would link women to crisis pregnancy centers (non-profits established by anti-abortion groups primarily to persuade pregnant women not to have an abortion).

===Washington, D.C. statehood===
In April 2021, Mace voiced her opposition to a Democratic proposal to grant the District of Columbia statehood. She argued that Washington, D.C. was too small to qualify as a state, saying, &quot;D.C. wouldn&#x27;t even qualify as a singular congressional district.&quot; However, D.C. has a larger population than the states of Wyoming and Vermont, both of which have a singular congressional district.

===Debt ceiling===
On May 31, 2023, Mace was among 71 House Republicans who voted against the final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 to raise the debt ceiling. Mace was one of three Republican members of the Problem Solvers Caucus who voted against raising the debt ceiling that day. Two days later she appeared on Steve Bannon&#x27;s podcast to claim, &quot;the American people were spoon-fed a bed of lies&quot; regarding the measure.

===Foreign policy===
In June 2021, Mace was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.

During the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mace wrote an article opposing military intervention in the conflict.

Mace voted for H.R. 7691, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022, which would provide $40 billion in emergency aid to the Ukrainian government. However, she voted against Ukraine aid the following year.

In 2023, Mace was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

In 2023, Mace was among 52 Republicans who voted in favor of H.Con.Res. 30, which would remove American troops from Somalia.

In 2023, Mace voted for a ban on a Center of Excellence in Ukraine that enhances NATO activities. 

In 2025, Mace supported President Trump&#x27;s proposal to send U.S. troops to take control of Gaza and remove the Gazans from the territory.

===Healthcare===
During her 2014 U.S. Senate campaign, Mace said &quot;We must use any means possible to repeal, defund, and ultimately stop Obamacare&quot; because it will &quot;suffocate individual liberty and further stifle economic growth&quot;.

=== Kamala Harris ===
On August 15, 2024, Nancy Mace received nationally circulated criticism for repeatedly mispronouncing Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris&#x27; name after initially pronouncing her name correctly. After saying &quot;Kamala&quot; correctly, Mace began to mispronounce the name and, when corrected by other &quot;CNN&quot; panelists, Mace claimed &quot;I will say Kamala&#x27;s name any way that I want to.&quot;

===Kevin McCarthy===
Mace was one of eight Republicans who voted for the removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House and the only one of those eight not considered a far-right politician by a 538 analysis of the 118th Congress. She fell in the &quot;Compromise Conservatives&quot; cluster instead, which the analysis noted tended to vote against hard-right messaging amendments but oppose bipartisan spending bills. Mace said she voted to vacate McCarthy out of distrust.

=== LGBTQ rights ===
In 2021, the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; wrote that Mace &quot;is a supporter of both religious liberty and gay marriage.&quot; Later that year, she told the &quot;Examiner&quot;, &quot;I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality. No one should be discriminated against.&quot; She opposed the Equality Act, instead co-sponsoring a Republican alternative called the Fairness for All Act.

Mace was one of 31 Republicans to vote for the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act. Mace was the lone Republican to sponsor H.R.5776 - Serving Our LGBTQ Veterans Act, legislation establishing a Center for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Veterans within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Among other functions, the center must serve as the department&#x27;s principal adviser on the adoption and implementation of policies and programs affecting veterans who are LGBTQ.

In July 2022, Mace was among 47 Republican representatives who voted in favor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which protects existing same-sex and interracial marriages under federal law. She later said, &quot;If gay couples want to be as happily or miserably married as straight couples, more power to them. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried it more than once.&quot;

At a House Oversight Committee hearing in February 2025, Mace used the slur &quot;tranny&quot; to refer to trans people; when confronted, she repeated the word three times saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t really care.&quot;

==== Protecting Women&#x27;s Private Spaces Act ====
On November 18, 2024, Mace introduced a resolution to ban transgender people from using bathrooms other than those of their sex assigned at birth at the U.S. Capitol. She specified that newly elected Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride was &quot;absolutely&quot; the target of her bathroom resolution. Mace described McBride as a &quot;biological man trying to force himself into women&#x27;s spaces&quot; and as a &quot;guy in a skirt&quot;, later following this up by saying &quot;It&#x27;s offensive that a man in a skirt thinks that he&#x27;s my equal&quot;. Mace&#x27;s 2024 House resolution would have prevented McBride from using single-sex facilities. 

On November 20, Mace announced a new national resolution to ban &quot;biological men from women&#x27;s spaces on all federal property.&quot; As some trans activists were protesting her bill, Mace referred to them as &quot;trannies&quot;, resulting in her posts on some social media being flagged for hateful content.

===Liz Cheney===
Mace opposed the first attempt to remove Liz Cheney as chair of the House Republican Conference, saying, &quot;We should not be silencing voices of dissent. That is one of the reasons we are in this today, is that we have allowed QAnon conspiracy theorists to lead us.&quot; In early May, Mace appeared at fundraiser events with Cheney. During the second attempt to remove Cheney as chair, however, Mace voted to remove her.

===Marijuana legalization===
In 2021, Mace introduced the States Reform Act to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and regulate it similarly to alcohol. She said: &quot;This bill supports veterans, law enforcement, farmers, businesses, those with serious illnesses, and it is good for criminal justice reform. ... The States Reform Act takes special care to keep Americans and their children safe while ending federal interference with state cannabis laws.&quot;

===Extraterrestrial life===
Mace has stated she believes space aliens have &quot;been interacting with humanity&quot;.

In an interview with OutKick, Mace cited the cases of Bob Lazar and David Grusch to conclude that explanations of UFO sightings that didn&#x27;t involve space aliens &quot;didn&#x27;t add up&quot;. 

During the 2024 United States drone sightings Mace said she would not rule out the purported drones were from &quot;outer space&quot; or &quot;outside the universe&quot;. A joint investigation by civilian and military agencies of the U.S. government failed to find &quot;anything anomalous&quot; and said that sightings included mistaken aircraft and other objects. State and local law enforcement as well as numerous independent experts reported similar conclusions.

===Steve Bannon===
On October 21, 2021, Mace was one of nine House Republicans who voted to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena to appear before the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. Explaining her vote, Mace said she was being &quot;consistent&quot; and wanted to retain the exercise of &quot;the power to subpoena&quot; in the event that Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives in 2022.

== Personal life ==
Mace&#x27;s first marriage was to Chris Niemiec, a lawyer and JAG Corps officer in the United States Air Force Reserve. After they divorced, Mace married Curtis Jackson, with whom she had two children. They divorced in 2019. Mace became engaged to Patrick Bryant in 2022, but the couple broke up in 2023. She reportedly broke off the engagement after finding Bryant on a dating app. In February 2025 she gave a speech in the House of Representatives where she accused Bryant and three other men of physical abuse, rape and sexual miscondunct against her and other women. 

Mace resides on Daniel Island in Charleston, South Carolina. On June 1, 2021, the Charleston Police Department opened an investigation after Mace&#x27;s home was vandalized with profanity, three anarchy symbols, and graffiti in support of the PRO Act.

Mace is non-denominational Protestant. She has attended Seacoast Church, a South Carolina-based megachurch.

<text>Brevard Zoo is a 75-acre nonprofit facility located in Melbourne, Florida, United States, that is home to more than 800 animals representing more than 170 species from Florida, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The zoo features animal feedings, kayak tours, behind-the-scenes tours, and a train ride, along with the attraction Treetop Trek. The zoo has also featured a dinosaur exhibit several times in its past, including one titled &quot;Dinosaurs are Back&quot;, which ran from November 2017 to April 2018. Brevard Zoo is a nonprofit organization accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

The zoo is divided into five loops: Expedition Africa, Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond, Wild Florida, Rainforest Revealed, and Paws On. These loops are accessed off of the main loop that encircles the flamingo pond.

==History==
In 1986, the East Coast Zoological Society of Florida, Inc. (ECZS) formed. One of their goals was to build a zoo for Brevard County to &quot;serve as a conversation hub where people could gather to learn about animals and nature. A place to escape from the manmade world and reconnect with the diversity of the life with which we share this planet.&quot; In 1992, construction of the zoo began, with over 16,000 people coming together to help build the zoo. The Brevard Zoo claims to have had &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Volunteer Community Build&quot;. Brevard Zoo celebrated its grand opening on March 26, 1994.

A record 328,973 visitors attended in 2007. This included 175,046 paid daily guests. The others included reciprocal members of other zoos, and annual members. The zoo has an annual budget of $5 million most of which is earned and not raised through fundraising or grants.

In October 2012, one of the southern white rhinos from this zoo was transferred to Alabama&#x27;s Birmingham Zoo to take part in a breeding program with its two female southern white rhinos.

In 2014, the black-throated monitor died. It was donated to the zoo when it was two years old in 2005.

In 2017, the zoo renovated their Australia and Asia exhibits and reopened them as &quot;Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond&quot;.

==Park areas==

===Expedition Africa===
The exhibit includes Masai giraffes, impalas, Grévy&#x27;s zebras, white rhinos, scimitar oryxes, dromedary camels, klipspringers, meerkats, an okapi, a common ostrich, crested guineafowl, West African crowned cranes, southern ground hornbills, and marabou storks. The area also includes red ruffed and ring-tailed lemurs and radiated tortoises.

The zoo offers Giraffe feeding on the Africa platform. Siamangs are located in-between the entrances to the Expedition Africa and Lands of Change loops. Expedition Africa also offers kayaking on the grounds of the zoo.

On November 12, 2024, a critically endangered Eastern Bongo calf was born in the zoo’s training yard.

On November 16, 2024, the zoo opened up an additional pathway and a new 15,150 square-feet habitat for their lions, who were previously housed in the Wild Florida loop.

===Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond===
This loop features animals from Australia, Oceania, Southeast Asia and South America. Visitors can find animals such as the red kangaroos, emus, dingos, North Sulawesi babirusas, Visayan warty pigs, wrinkled hornbills and black swans.

Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond also hosts the free-flight aviary where visitors have the option of feeding rainbow lorikeets. The aviary is home to: galahs, cockatiels, laughing kookaburras, Victoria crowned pigeons and radjah shelducks, among others. It is divided into two sections - the &quot;lorikeet side&quot; and the &quot;cockatiel side&quot;. Right across from the aviary is a state of the art kangaroo walkabout where guests can get up close and personal with the zoo&#x27;s kangaroos and emus. Inside the kangaroo walkabout, there are several solar panel &quot;trees&quot; that were donated to the zoo by Florida Power &amp; Light. The solar panels provide shade for the kangaroos, but their most important function is that they provide all the energy for the Komodo dragon house, where the Komodo dragons are located. Siamangs, a type of gibbon, are located in-between the entrances to the Africa and Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond.

===Rainforest Revealed===

Rainforest Revealed houses the zoo&#x27;s black howler monkeys, jaguars, cotton-top tamarins, giant anteaters, golden-headed lion tamarins, black-handed spider monkeys, Chilean flamingos, macaws, tortoises, reptiles and fishes. This loop also feature&#x27;s green iguanas, a Baird&#x27;s tapir, a family of capybara, and a Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloth. In March 2007, a newly constructed vulture exhibit opened, which houses king vultures, turkey vultures and black vultures. Vulture feedings and demonstrations are offered to visitors much the same way they are conducted within the Wild Florida loop.

===Wild Florida===
The exhibit includes American alligators, American crocodiles, bald eagles, crested caracaras, sandhill cranes, turtles, American black bears, white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, and bobcats. The loop is also home to three rescued Florida Black Bears named Cheyenne, Brody, and Betty. In 2021, two North American river otters fell ill and died unexpectedly. Their exhibit now houses an alligator snapping turtle.

Paws On provides a place for children to play in a playground, a splash pad, and a petting zoo for children to explore. The exhibit includes a shallow swimming area (splash pad); an aquarium mimicking the underwater environment of the nearby Indian River Lagoon with animals such as tarpons, stingrays, and black drums; a viewing tank with horseshoe crabs, hermit crabs, and Florida crown conchs; a pizzeria, and various other attractions aimed towards children of all ages. Exhibits from the old Paws On that were kept include the Soil Cube and the Whale Slide. The Barnyard (petting zoo) contains Nigerian dwarf goats, an African spurred tortoise, and chickens. Other animals include eastern box turtles and two female bloodhounds named Cindy Pawford and Sarah Jessica Barker.

===Caribbean Trail===
Opened in November 2013, the “Treasures of the Caribbean” trail is home to animals such as the Grand Cayman Blue Iguana and the Yellow-Naped Amazon. This exhibit also features a pirate-themed scavenger hunt.

==Operations==
The zoo received 363,426 visitors in 2011, up 5% from the previous year. This represented the second highest number of visitors on record.

<doc id="1127781" wikidata="Q4825054" url="?curid=1127781" title="Australian migration zone">
<text>The Australian migration zone is a legal device created by the Australian Government for the purpose of Australia&#x27;s visa policy and immigration policy, as the territory in which Australia&#x27;s visa policy applies. The Australian migration zone covers such Australian controlled territories as the government may determine. Prior to 2001, the Australian migration zone consisted of the mainland, as well as some external territories. Norfolk Island, for example, was not part of the Australian migration zone until 2016. Under Australia’s universal visa policy, a non-citizen must hold an Australian visa within the Australian migration zone. Without such a visa, or a bridging visa, the non-citizen is an unlawful non-citizen and treated as an &quot;unauthorised arrival&quot;. However, the main effect of the migration zone is that unauthorised arrivals outside the zone have very limited access for review by Australian courts.

In the Australian government’s strategy to stem the flow of unauthorised arrivals into Australia, in September 2001, the government passed the &quot;Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act&quot; 2001 and the &quot;Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act&quot; 2001 which removed (&quot;excised&quot;) a number of external territories from the Australian migration zone. The excised territories included Ashmore, Cartier, Christmas and Cocos Islands, which lie in the Indian Ocean between Indonesia and Australia. The effect of the change was to limit the ability of unauthorised arrivals arriving there, termed &quot;offshore entry persons&quot;, to apply for a visa on arrival. However, the Minister was still empowered to grant a visa to such persons “in the public interest”. In 2010, a landmark High Court ruled that the processing procedures on Christmas Island were unlawful and unconstitutional. 

After these territories were excised, increasing numbers of asylum seekers attempted to reach the Australian mainland by-passing those islands. To combat this tactic, on 30 October 2012, the Australian government excised the entire Australian mainland from the Australian migration zone. The objective of the change was to limit judicial review for boat arrivals. The legislation to excise the mainland itself from the migration zone was passed by Parliament on 16 May 2013. Before the excise, asylum seekers who reached the mainland by boat could not be sent for immigration processing to offshore Australian immigration detention facilities on Nauru or Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Manus Island. 

The excising of islands from the Australian migration zone was and remains a controversial aspect of Australian immigration policy. Refugee advocates argue that Australia is not meeting its obligations under international law to protect refugees. This was not accepted by the Howard government, which contended that international law obliged Australia to provide temporary protection only and not necessarily permanent settlement.

==Effect on unauthorised arrivals==

The Australian government claims that in the excised areas Australia has no obligation to grant asylum seekers a visa to settle permanently in Australia (as opposed to temporary protection). The main objective of excising areas from the Australian migration zone is to limit access of unauthorised arrivals to review by Australian courts. Asylum seekers who land in an excised area may only apply for refugee status with the UNHCR. 

The Acts also included the powers to move unauthorised arrivals to another country where their claim for protection could be considered. Under this authority, thousands of asylum seekers have been moved to off-shore immigration detention facilities on Christmas Island, Nauru, and Manus Island.

In subsequent years, the government excised other islands, sometimes attempting to do so retroactively, after asylum seekers had already landed.

However, the Rudd government abolished the temporary protection visa scheme in 2008. The practice of diverting boat-borne arrivals to Christmas Island remained, effectively disallowing judicial review. 

On 16 May 2013, the Australian Parliament passed an Act to effectively excise the entire Australian mainland from the migration zone.

==Legal implications of excision==
At times, there has been confusion over the effect on Australia&#x27;s sovereignty over the excised area. Various constitution authorities have voiced the opinion that excising territory from the migration zone does not affect Australia&#x27;s sovereignty.

The &quot;excision&quot; of areas from the migration zone has no effect on the rights of Australian citizens and permanent residents to travel to and remain in that area, and no documentation is required to travel between these areas and the rest of Australia. Nor is there any effect on the rights of those non-citizens who arrive in these territories with valid visas.

==Bringing Norfolk Island within the zone==

Norfolk Island, an Australian external territory, was brought within the Australian migration zone on 1 July 2016. From that date, anyone living on Norfolk Island needed to be an Australian citizen or hold a visa under the Australian &quot;Migration Act 1958&quot;, and all island legislation on the matter ceased to apply. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection became responsible for administering the system and non-citizen permit holders (except those holding visitor permits) or permanent residents of Norfolk Island were given comparable Australian visa categories. However, a new temporary visa, called Provisional Resident Return visa (subclass 159) was created for those persons who held a work permit for Norfolk Island, who were then only entitled to work on Norfolk Island, and not the rest of Australia.

<doc id="1127787" wikidata="Q1544817" url="?curid=1127787" title="The Feelies">
<text>The Feelies are an American rock band from Haledon, New Jersey. They formed in 1976 and disbanded in 1992 after having released four albums. The band reunited in 2008, and released new albums in 2011 and 2017.

Although not commercially successful, the Feelies had an influence on the development of American indie rock. Their first album, &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; (Stiff Records, 1980), was cited by R.E.M. as influencing their sound. The Feelies were influenced by the Beatles, the Velvet Underground and Lou Reed.

The Feelies rarely worked with outside producers, although Peter Buck of R.E.M. co-produced their second album, &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, one of their most successful albums. They frequently played at Maxwell&#x27;s, a live music venue and bar/restaurant in Hoboken, during the 1980s.

==Early history==
Glenn Mercer, Bill Million, Dave Weckerman and vocalist Richard Reilly began playing together in 1976 in Haledon, New Jersey, in a band called the Outkids. The Outkids evolved into the Feelies with the addition of Vinny DeNunzio on drums and Keith Denunzio on bass. The band&#x27;s name is taken from a fictional entertainment device described in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

In 1978, Vinny left the band and shortly after John Piccarella of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; dubbed the then-unsigned Feelies &quot;The Best Underground Band in New York&quot;. Anton Fier, who had just arrived to New York from Cleveland, joined the band through a mutual acquaintance, Charles Beasley, who was briefly a percussionist in the Feelies. With the line-up of Mercer, Million, DeNunzio and Fier on drums, the Feelies released their first single, &quot;Fa Cé-La&quot;, on Rough Trade Records in 1979.

The Feelies&#x27; debut album, &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot;, was released on Stiff Records in 1980, featuring the same line-up as on the &quot;Fa Cé-La&quot; Rough Trade single.

==First hiatus and early offshoots==
After &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot;, Fier stated his desire to leave the band and join the Lounge Lizards as their full-time drummer. Keith DeNunzio left the band. With the Feelies in limbo, Mercer and Million collaborated with other local New Jersey musicians, forming one of a number of Feelies offshoots, The Trypes, featuring some once and future Feelies members, including Brenda Sauter, Dave Weckerman and Stanley Demeski of dream pop band Luna, as well as John Baumgartner, Marc Francia and Toni Paruta. The Trypes, quieter and more psychedelic than the Feelies, played regular live gigs around the New York/Hoboken scene at clubs such as Maxwell&#x27;s and Folk City. In 1984, Coyote Records released the Trypes 12&quot; EP, &quot;Music for Neighbors&quot;, produced by Million and Mercer, &quot;The Explorers Hold&quot;, featuring three original songs (credited to Mercer alone or with other band members), plus a cover of the George Harrison song &quot;Love You To&quot;, which originally had appeared on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot;. The Trypes also contributed a Million/Mercer-produced original song, &quot;A Plan Revised&quot;, to the 1985 Coyote anthology of Hoboken acts, &quot;Luxury Condos Coming To Your Neighborhood Soon&quot;. Some members of the Trypes later formed the band Speed The Plough. Acute Records reissued the &quot;Music for Neighbors&quot; LP in 2012, which quickly sold out. Pravda Records re-reissued it in 2022 and it is also available as a digital release on Bandcamp along with their &quot;Live at Maxwell&#x27;s 1984&quot;.

Million, Mercer, Sauter, Demeski and Baumgartner also gigged around New York and Hoboken under the name Yung Wu, which was fronted by and featured the songs of Feelies&#x27; percussionist Dave Weckerman, who also sang lead. Yung Wu released one album on Coyote Records in 1986, titled &quot;Shore Leave&quot;. It featured Weckerman originals, plus covers of &quot;Big Day&quot;, &quot;Child of the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Powderfinger&quot;, a staple of their live gigs.

The Willies, also known as the Willies From Haledon, were yet another Feelies offshoot that played around the New York/Hoboken clubs in the early 1980s. The Willies shared a similar lineup as the later Feelies, but their live sets consisted mostly of cover songs, extended instrumentals and psychedelic jams, such as &quot;Third Stone From the Sun&quot; and &quot;Sedan Delivery&quot;. The Feelies&#x27; appearance in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Something Wild&quot; was credited to the Willies.

==Mid-period (1980–1992)==
The members of the Feelies never stopped playing and collaborating in the 1980s, earning them the distinction of being &quot;the New York area&#x27;s best-loved underground rockers since the late 1970s&quot;, according to Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1986. The band occasionally even performed under The Feelies name, often on holidays at Maxwell&#x27;s. At least one such gig on May Day 1983 featured a reunion of the &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; line-up of Million, Mercer, DeNunzio and Fier. By the late 1980s, the band re-emerged from their self-imposed exile with new members and their first new album in six years.

Reformed as a quintet featuring Mercer, Million, Weckerman, Sauter and Demeski, the Feelies recorded &quot;The Good Earth&quot; in 1985 with Peter Buck of R.E.M. on board as co-producer with Mercer and Million. The album was released in 1986 and featured ten original Mercer/Million compositions. The band toured in support of the album as an opening band for Lou Reed as well as R.E.M. that year.

In 1988, the Feelies signed to a major label and released the album &quot;Only Life&quot; on A&amp;M Records. The lineup was the same as &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, and Mercer and Million again handled production duties. The disc was a critical favorite, coming in at No. 27 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Pazz &amp; Jop&quot; critics&#x27; poll. Recently, the album&#x27;s title track has been used as the introductory music for the Harvard Business Review&#x27;s &quot;HBR Idea Cast&quot;.

The band&#x27;s final album before a hiatus, &quot;Time for a Witness&quot;, was released on A&amp;M in 1991. The album broke little new ground from &quot;Only Life&quot; but still earned the band critical praise.

In 1994, Weckerman and Mercer started their project, &quot;Wake Ooloo&quot;, with their first album being &quot;Hear No Evil&quot;. A European tour took place in 1995.

==Later period (2008–present)==
The band played reunion shows in the summer and fall of 2008. A performance at Battery Park in NYC with Sonic Youth followed several warm-up shows at Maxwell&#x27;s. In June 2009, the band performed an acoustic show at the Whitney Museum. They also headlined a show at Millennium Park in Chicago. In September 2009, they performed &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series.

Bar/None Records reissued &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; and &quot;The Good Earth&quot; on September 8, 2009. Domino Records reissued both albums outside of the U.S. and Canada.

In March 2011, the Feelies released their first record in 20 years, &quot;Here Before&quot;, which was produced by Bill Million and Glenn Mercer for the Bar/None record label. The band remains &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s most beloved alternative-rock bands.&quot;

The Feelies have reunited sporadically over the last two decades to play concerts at their early home at Maxwell&#x27;s. On June 10, 2016, for the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary the Feelies performed with their original line-up of Mercer, Million, and the DeNunzio brothers.

The Feelies sixth studio album, &quot;In Between&quot;, was released in February 2017, also on the Bar/None label. Reviews were generally favorable, with Metacritic calculating an average critical rating of 81%.

A reunited Feelies played at Wilco&#x27;s every-other-year festival, Solid Sound, in North Adams, MA, in June 2019.

In November 2022, the Feelies performed a tribute concert for Anton Fier, who had recently passed and were joined on-stage by Keith DeNunzio on bass.

In October 2023, the Feelies released a Velvet Underground cover album entitled &quot;Some Kinda Love: Performing The Music Of The Velvet Underground&quot;. It featured covers of 18 songs and was released on the Bar/None label. The recording itself comes from a performance at White Eagle Hall in Jersey City, New Jersey, on October 13, 2018.

==Film appearances==
The band was featured in the 1986 Jonathan Demme movie, &quot;Something Wild&quot;, playing a band at a high school reunion. Credited as &quot;The Willies&quot;, they performed bits of five songs, including &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; and &quot;Loveless Love&quot;, as well as covers of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot; and the Monkees&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; (written by Neil Diamond).

No Feelies songs appeared on the &quot;Something Wild&quot; soundtrack, but their song &quot;Too Far Gone&quot; was included on the &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; soundtrack, another Demme film. Million and Mercer were also brought together by director Susan Seidelman to create the score for her debut feature-film, &quot;Smithereens&quot;. Demme included the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; from the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Good Earth&quot;, in his 2002 film, &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot;; it is also featured on the soundtrack of Noah Baumbach&#x27;s 2005 film, &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot;, and the 2023 film &quot;Robot Dreams&quot;.

Their song &quot;When Company Comes&quot; from their &quot;Good Earth&quot; album was featured in the 2018 movie &quot;The Miseducation of Cameron Post&quot;.

==Musical style and legacy==
AllMusic referred to the Feelies as &quot;heroes of the 1980s indie underground&quot;. Their sound has been described as &quot;noisy&quot; and &quot;droning&quot; avant-garde pop. One of their greatest influences was the Velvet Underground, closing their third album, &quot;Only Life&quot;, with a cover of the band&#x27;s song &quot;What Goes On&quot;.

<doc id="1127788" wikidata="Q186330" url="?curid=1127788" title="Rafael Márquez">
<text>Rafael Márquez Álvarez (; born 13 February 1979) is a Mexican football coach and former player who played as a defender. He is currently the assistant coach of the Mexico national team. Nicknamed &quot;El Káiser&quot;, he is regarded as the best defender in Mexico&#x27;s history and one of the best Mexican players of all time.

Márquez began his career with Atlas in 1996, playing in over 70 games with the club before moving to France in 1999 with Monaco, where he won a Ligue 1 title. In 2003, Márquez joined Barcelona, becoming the first ever Mexican to represent the club. He would go on to play in over 240 games during seven seasons with the &quot;Blaugrana&quot; and win numerous honors, including four La Liga titles and two UEFA Champions League titles. In 2006, he became the first Mexican player to win the Champions League when Barcelona defeated Arsenal in the final. In 2010, Márquez joined Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls. After being released from the club in 2012, he returned to his native Mexico, this time to play for León, captaining the team to back-to-back Liga MX titles in 2013 and 2014. Márquez then transferred to Hellas Verona of the Italian Serie A. He returned to his boyhood club Atlas in 2015, and announced his retirement from football in April 2018.

Márquez is the fourth most-capped player in the history of the Mexico national football team, earning 147 caps throughout his career. In 2018, he became only the fourth player to play for his national team in five consecutive editions of the FIFA World Cup, alongside compatriot Antonio Carbajal, Lothar Matthäus, and Gianluigi Buffon, appearing in the 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 tournaments. He is also the Mexican player with the most World Cup matches played with 19. With the national team, Márquez won the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2003 and 2011 editions of the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==Club career==
===Atlas===
Márquez began his career with Atlas, making his debut in October 1996 at only 17 years of age. Márquez rose to prominence while with Atlas, making 77 appearances for the team and being runner-up in the league, losing the final against Toluca on penalties during the Verano 1999 tournament.

===Monaco===
After playing the 1999 Copa América with Mexico, Márquez joined French club Monaco for a reported US$6 million. He made his debut on 14 August against Bastia. In his first season, Monaco won the Ligue 1 (then known as the French Division 1) title, with Márquez being named in the league&#x27;s Team of the Season. He went on to play in 109 matches with Monaco over four seasons, winning the Coupe de la Ligue as well.

===Barcelona===

In the summer of 2003, Márquez signed for Spanish club Barcelona. He made his debut in La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla, the match ending in a 1–1 draw. On 9 November, he scored his first goal for Barcelona in their 2–1 victory over Real Betis. In his first season with Barcelona, Márquez made 22 league appearances (31 across all competitions) as the team finished second in the league, five points behind Valencia.

During his second season, he was moved from his natural position as a centre-back to a defensive midfield role, due to injuries to players Thiago Motta, Edmílson and Gerard. That year, Barcelona won its 17th league title on 14 May 2005 after a 1–1 tie with Levante. A month after an injury to his left knee, Márquez returned to play against A.C. Milan in the first leg of the 2006 UEFA Champions League semi-final. Barcelona, playing away at the San Siro, won 1–0. On 17 May, Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League after defeating Arsenal 2–1 in the final, with Márquez playing the entire match. He became the first Mexican to play in a Champions League final and the first to win it. Following his participation with Mexico at the 2006 World Cup, Márquez signed a four-year contract extension with Barcelona, with the buy-out clause set at €100 million.

During the 2007–08 season, Márquez formed a partnership with new signing Gabriel Milito while captain Carles Puyol was out injured. Constant injuries, however, threw off his form. Márquez&#x27;s success declined with the rest of the season, leading Barcelona to end up in third place in La Liga after a miserable second half where injuries lead to his contribution being negligible. Even so, new coach Pep Guardiola continued to rely on his contributions; with the departure of Ronaldinho, Márquez had become the last original signing of the Frank Rijkaard era to remain on the team. In October 2007, Márquez was included in the list of players nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, the only player from the CONCACAF to be nominated.
Márquez was Guardiola&#x27;s first-choice at centre-back along with captain Puyol for the 2008–09 season. On 13 December 2008, Márquez played his 200th match for Barcelona in their 2–0 win against Real Madrid. On 28 April 2009, during Barcelona&#x27;s 2008–09 Champions League semi-final match against Chelsea, Márquez sustained a knee injury which required surgery, meaning he would miss the remainder of the season. Barcelona would go on to complete a historic treble after winning the Champions League final 2–0 against Manchester United.

Prior to the 2009–10 season, Márquez received an offer from Italian Serie A club Fiorentina. Márquez, however, said he wanted to end his career at Barcelona. Márquez eventually signed a new contract with Barça in November 2009 that would keep him at the club until 2012. On 20 February 2010, he scored his first goal since his return against Racing Santander.

On 31 July 2010, Márquez was released from his contract by Barcelona. During his time with the club, he played in 242 matches and scored 13 goals, making him the most-capped non-European player in the club&#x27;s history and the eighth-most capped foreigner. In his 12-year European career, Márquez appeared in 46 UEFA Champions League matches, which was the most by a Mexican or CONCACAF player, until compatriot Javier Hernández surpassed that record in 2017. At the time, Márquez was also one of two players from CONCACAF to play in a Champions League final, the other being Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s Dwight Yorke for Manchester United in 1999.

===New York Red Bulls===

After seven years with and being released by Barcelona and participating at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, it was reported that Italian club Juventus were interested in signing Márquez as a back-up for defender Leonardo Bonucci.

On 1 August 2010, it was announced that Márquez had signed with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He was the club&#x27;s third Designated Player and was unveiled to the media at Red Bull Arena on 3 August wearing the number 4 jersey and reuniting with former Barcelona teammate Thierry Henry. On 8 August, Márquez made his MLS debut against the Chicago Fire in a scoreless draw. On 21 August, Márquez scored his first goal, an astonishing shot with his right foot, for the Red Bulls in a 4–1 win at Toronto FC. On 21 October, Márquez started for the Red Bulls in a 2–0 victory over New England Revolution which clinched the regular season Eastern Conference title.

New York released Márquez on 13 December 2012. His stint in New York was heavily criticized by many fans and journalists for his constant injuries, suspensions and perceived lack of commitment to the fans and club. Márquez later revealed in an interview with ESPN Deportes that going to play in the United States was &quot;a bad decision&quot; and called it the worst decision he ever made in his career. He said that he had misjudged the arc of his career, believing it was declining faster than it was, and that he regretted declining offers from various European clubs, including one from Italian side Juventus.

===León===
Hours after being released by the New York Red Bulls, it was announced that Márquez signed with Liga MX side León, returning to his home country after 13 years abroad. It would not be until 5 October 2013 that Márquez scored his first goal for León in the Liga MX against Puebla, scoring a penalty kick in the 17th minute.

On 15 December, León captured the Apertura 2013 title after defeating América 5–1 on aggregate. Márquez, the club captain, played in both legs as he lifted his first league title in Mexico, more than 14 years after losing the final against Toluca when he played in Atlas. The following tournament, Márquez helped León capture their second straight league title, becoming only the second team in history to win consecutive league titles in the short tournament era, the first being UNAM, who won the Clausura 2004 and Apertura 2004. He also became the first Mexican footballer to win league titles in three countries.

===Hellas Verona===
On 7 August 2014, Hellas Verona of Serie A signed Márquez on undisclosed terms. He stated that he had taken a pay cut to join the club as he was desperate to return to Europe. Márquez made his league debut on 31 August, starting as Verona played out a goalless draw at home against Atalanta.

===Return to Atlas===
On 21 December 2015, it was announced that Márquez had officially transferred to Atlas, returning to the club he debuted with. He was handed the number 4 shirt.

On 19 April 2018, Márquez announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He did, however, state his intention of representing Mexico at the World Cup. Márquez played his final match at the Estadio Jalisco on 20 April, a 1–0 victory in the Clásico Tapatío against Guadalajara. The following week, Márquez played his final club match against Pachuca at the Estadio Hidalgo, which ended in a 0–0 draw.

==International career==

Márquez made his debut with Mexico on 5 February 1997 in a friendly match against Ecuador. It was reported that his call-up was due to an error made by national team coach Bora Milutinović, who wanted to call up fellow Atlas player César Márquez. Márquez became a regular call-up for Mexico, although he was not chosen for the 1998 FIFA World Cup squad. Márquez played various tournaments with the national team, winning the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup and losing to Canada at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Márquez started all four of Mexico&#x27;s games during the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, where he was given the captain&#x27;s armband by then coach Javier Aguirre despite his young age of 23. He received a red card during Mexico&#x27;s second round 2–0 loss to the United States for a deliberate mid-air head butt on Cobi Jones in the final minutes of the match.

Márquez was selected by Ricardo La Volpe for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Márquez played in all of three of Mexico&#x27;s opening round matches, and scored the lone Mexican goal in a 2–1 loss to Argentina in the second round off a Pável Pardo free kick which was headed to the far post by Mario Méndez, allowing an unmarked Márquez to strike the ball into the back of the net. The winner was scored by Maxi Rodríguez in extra time after Hernán Crespo had equalised for Argentina.

New Mexico coach Hugo Sánchez called-up Márquez to participate in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the 2007 Copa América. Márquez joined up with the team Mexico for the Gold Cup&#x27;s championship game against the United States after the conclusion of 2006–07 La Liga; he started the match, which Mexico lost 2–1.

Márquez captained Mexico at the 2010 World Cup, scoring Mexico&#x27;s goal in the tournament&#x27;s opening match against South Africa which ended in a 1–1 draw. In Mexico&#x27;s 2–0 win against France, Márquez assisted Javier Hernández in Mexico&#x27;s first goal.

On 29 March 2011, Márquez became the eighth player in history to reach 100 caps for Mexico in a friendly match against Venezuela, where Mexico drew 1–1.

During Mexico&#x27;s opening match at the 2014 World Cup – a 1–0 win over Cameroon – Márquez became the first player to captain a team in four World Cups. On 23 June, he scored the opening goal in the 3–1 win against Croatia, thus advancing to the knockout stage. This goal made Márquez the first Mexican player to score in three consecutive World Cups, and the second Mexican player ever to score in three World Cups after Cuauhtémoc Blanco.

In May 2015, it was announced Márquez was included in the 23-man squad that would participate in the Copa América tournament in Chile. He was selected to start as captain in Mexico&#x27;s opening fixture of the tournament, a 0–0 draw with Bolivia in Viña del Mar. The following year, Márquez captained Mexico at the Copa América Centenario, scoring in their opening game a 3–1 victory over Uruguay.

On 11 November 2016, in a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Columbus, Ohio, Márquez scored the winning goal for Mexico in the 89th minute to seal a 2–1 victory over the United States.

Appearing in Mexico&#x27;s second group-stage match against New Zealand at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, Márquez – at 38 years and four months – became the second-oldest player to appear in a match in Confederations Cup history. He was also making his first appearance at the tournament since 2005, setting new record for most years between consecutive matches with twelve.

On 4 June 2018, Marquez was named in Mexico&#x27;s final 23-man squad for the World Cup. This meant he would travel to his fifth World Cup finals, becoming only the fourth player in history to do so, alongside German Lothar Matthäus, Italian Gianluigi Buffon and fellow Mexican Antonio Carbajal. He was substituted in for Andrés Guardado at the 74th minute in Mexico&#x27;s 1–0 win over defending-champions Germany, and became the third man in history to play at a fifth World Cup. On 2 July, in Mexico&#x27;s round of 16 match against Brazil, Márquez became the first player ever to play as a captain in five World Cups and was substituted off at half-time, marking his last appearance as a professional.

== Coaching career ==
Following his retirement, he was introduced as Atlas&#x27; new sporting president, succeeding Fabricio Bassa. He held the position until May 2019. In October 2021, Márquez joined the TUDN network as an analyst and commentator for national team games.

=== Alcalá ===
On 8 April 2020, Márquez was appointed as a youth coach at Alcalá, taking care of the Cadete A (under 15) squad for the 2020–21 season.

=== Barcelona Atlètic ===
On 14 July 2022, Márquez was appointed head coach of Barcelona Atlètic, signing a two-year contract. In his first season in charge, he led Barça Atlètic to a fourth place finish, qualifying for the promotional playoffs before being eliminated by Real Madrid Castilla 5–4 on aggregate. On 14 June 2023, it was announced that Márquez would continue with the team, signing an extension. On 21 July 2024, Barcelona Atlètic announced Rafael&#x27;s departure of the club.

=== Mexico === 
On 22 July 2024, the Mexican Football Federation announced Márquez to be the assistant coach of the Mexico national football team led by Javier Aguirre.

==Style of play and reception==
Capable of playing as a centre-back, sweeper, or defensive midfielder, Márquez is widely considered to be one of Mexico&#x27;s greatest-ever players. He has been described as elegant on the ball and in his tackling, possessing excellent technical ability and vision, tactical awareness, dependable in the air for both defending and attacking, and being skillful coming out of defense. Affectionately nicknamed the &quot;Kaiser of Michoacan&quot;, he also stood out for his leadership ability. In 2024, La Liga included Márquez in its Barcelona best eleven of the 21st century.

==Outside football==
===Personal life===
Márquez&#x27;s father, Rafael Márquez Esqueda, was also a professional football player in Mexico. Rafael married Mexican actress Adriana Lavat in December 2001 and had two children, Santiago Rafael and Rafaela, before separating in 2007 and divorcing. He is now married to Jaydy Michel, ex-wife of singer Alejandro Sanz. His younger cousin, Luis Alberto Márquez, is also a professional footballer. Luis developed in Atlas&#x27; rival club, Guadalajara and also played for Zacatepec.

He appeared on the North American cover of &quot;FIFA 12&quot; alongside Wayne Rooney and Landon Donovan.

In October 2017, Márquez helped found &quot;Asociación Mexicana de Futbolistas&quot; (Mexican Footballers Association).

===Kingpin Act designation===
On 9 August 2017, it was reported that Márquez was among 22 people sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the &quot;Kingpin Act&quot;) by the United States Treasury Department for alleged ties to a drug trafficking organization allegedly headed by Raúl Flores Hernández, a suspected drug trafficker with links to the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. He was placed on a Specially Designated Nationals List by the Treasury Department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Nine businesses, including a soccer school and charitable foundation, were linked to Márquez by the OFAC. All 22 people were accused of providing support to, or being under the control of Flores Hernández.

According to the OFAC, Márquez conducted money laundering by acting as a strawperson for Flores Hernández and his criminal organization. They alleged that Márquez used businessmen Mauricio Heredia Horner and Marco Antonio Fregoso González to act for or on his behalf. Márquez&#x27;s assets &quot;that are under U.S. jurisdiction or are in the control of U.S. persons&quot; would be frozen. The Mexican Attorney General&#x27;s Office said in a statement that Márquez came voluntarily to their offices to provide a statement that same day. Since 22 September 2021 he has been removed from the list and is now clear of his name from the U.S. Treasury Department.

<text>USS &quot;Blower&quot; (SS-325), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy in commission from 1944 to 1950. She was named after the blower, a type of pufferfish of the United States East Coast and West Indies. During World War II, She completed three war patrols, all in the Indian Ocean, Java Sea, and South China Sea.

&quot;Blower&quot; was transferred to Turkey in 1950 under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program, where she was recommissioned in the Turkish Naval Forces as the second TCG &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;. &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; sank after an accident off the coast of Turkey on 4 April 1953 following a joint North Atlantic Treaty Organization training exercise.

== Construction and commissioning ==

&quot;Blower&quot;′s keel was laid down on 15 July 1943 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company. She was launched on 23 April 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Richard F. J. Johnson, wife of Commander Richard F. J. Johnson, and commissioned on 10 August 1944 with Lieutenant Commander James H. Campbell in command.

==Service history==
===United States Navy===
====World War II====
=====August 1944–January 1945=====
Following shakedown training off the coast of New England and in Narragansett Bay, &quot;Blower&quot; departed Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton on 17 September 1944 for advanced training at the Sound School in Key West, Florida. She left Key West on 10 October 1944 bound for the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean. Early on the morning of 11 October, during a heavy rain squall, the submarine chaser collided with her. No one on either ship suffered any injuries, but &quot;PC-1145&quot;′s bow was smashed back to the first water-tight bulkhead. &quot;Blower&quot; suffered a hole in her bow buoyancy tank, damage to her conning tower, and a sheared blade on her starboard propeller. She returned to Key West on 12 October 1944 for repairs, but the damage proved to be so extensive that the work had to be completed at Groton.

&quot;Blower&quot; got underway from Groton again on 13 November 1944, bound via the Panama Canal for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which she reached on 16 December 1944. She spent a month training at Pearl Harbor, then proceeded to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where she topped off her fuel supply.

=====First war patrol=====
&quot;Blower&quot; departed Saipan for her first war patrol on 17 January 1945. She spent most of the 48-day patrol in the South China Sea between Hainan Island and Japanese-occupied French Indochina off Cape Tourane. She served as part of a scouting line of 15 submarines stretched out across the South China Sea between Singapore and the Formosa Strait along the most probable track for Japanese warships returning to Japan after an oil resupply mission to Singapore. On 13 February 1945 she sighted the masts of a battleship and two cruisers and, after some maneuvering, managed to fire six torpedoes from a range of . Her sound operators reported one hit on each of two targets, and she later spotted two oil slicks, but Japanese records do not indicate any damage. She also tried to attack Japanese convoys off Tourane, French Indochina, on 15, 22, and 24 February 1945 but could not get close enough, mainly owing to Japanese air patrols and large numbers of small fishing boats that impeded her efforts. Groups of floating mines often forced her to submerge at inopportune moments, further disrupting her operations.

With her diesel fuel running low, &quot;Blower&quot; headed for Fremantle, Australia, on 5 March. She arrived at Fremantle on 19 March 1945 and began a refit alongside the submarine tender , during which she received new LORAN (long-range navigation) and radio direction-finding equipment and an overhaul of both of her radars and all four of her diesel engines.

=====Second war patrol=====
&quot;Blower&quot; departed Fremantle to begin her second war patrol on 14 April 1945. After a brief stop to refuel at Exmouth Gulf on the coast of Western Australia, she proceeded through Lombok Strait on 21 April 1945 and took up a patrol station in the Java Sea. On 22 April, she received orders to form a coordinated attack group with the submarines and . The three submarines set up a scouting line at intervals across the east-west shipping routes between Makassar and Borneo and covering the north-south lanes between Borneo and Java. &quot;Blower&quot;′s only surface contact was with &quot;Besugo&quot;, with which she rendezvoused twice. &quot;Blower&quot; also was plagued by numerous Japanese patrol aircraft. Indeed, at 11:30 on 25 April 1944, her lookouts spotted two closing Imperial Japanese Navy floatplanes and she quickly dove to avoid attack. Unfortunately for &quot;Blower&quot;, the water near Solombol Island was clear and only deep, allowing the floatplanes to bomb and otherwise harass her for almost two hours as she twisted and turned along the sea bed.

Early on the morning of 26 April 1945, &quot;Blower&quot; picked up two slow-moving radar contacts at a range of about . Concluding they were what the Americans called &quot;sea trucks,&quot; a type of slow Japanese cargo ferry, &quot;Blower&quot; closed to engage them on the surface. At 03:22, however, one target turned and increased speed to , indicating that she was a warship rather than a &quot;sea truck&quot; and prompting &quot;Blower&quot; to start bearing away. Ten minutes later, at a range of , the Japanese ship opened fire with a three-gun salvo, bracketing &quot;Blower&quot;, with two shots landing within of her. &quot;Blower&quot;′s war diarist later noted &quot;On target - this boy had nice radar ranges. Submerged.&quot; &quot;Blower&quot; then maneuvered to try and launch a submerged attack, but the Japanese warship moved in a fast search pattern until heading off to the northwest toward &quot;Perch&quot;′s position at 05:30. Just over 12 hours later, &quot;Blower&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Perch&quot;, whose commanding officer, Commander Francis B. McCall, said the Japanese warship &quot;had worked him over plenty about noon and put his radar and attack periscope out of commission.&quot;

Moving to a nearby patrol position on 27 April 1945, the coordinated attack group cruised off southern Borneo for over a week. It did not find any worthwhile targets, just the ever-present fleets of small native sailboats. At one point, &quot;Blower&quot;′s diarist wrote &quot;Sailboat in sight. They are even up here. Would certainly like to practice [on them] with the 40 mm&#x27;s [i.e., &quot;Blower&quot;′s 40-millimeter guns].&quot;

Turning northwest on 6 May 1945, &quot;Blower&quot; proceeded to Cape Varella off the Malay Peninsula, arranging for a rendezvous with the submarine at 12:30 on 9 May, just after exchanging calls with &quot;Perch&quot;. The entry in &quot;Blower&quot;′s war diary reads: &quot;Received mail from &quot;Baya&quot;. What a commentary on the vaunted Jap[anese] air power in the South China Sea. Three fleet submarines within five miles [i.e., 5 nautical miles (9.3 km; 5.8 mi)] of each other; two exchanging mail and movies, and one proceeding unconcernedly on its way.&quot; Targets were no more apparent in her new patrol area than off Borneo, however, and &quot;Blower&quot; turned to providing lifeguard duties for United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress four-engine bomber strikes on Nha Trang and Saigon in French Indochina on 12 and 21 May 1945. She also conducted a submerged reconnaissance of Vân Phong Bay and Nha Trang Bay on 16 May but saw nothing other than local fishing sailboats. Perhaps the most exciting moment took place on 19 May, when &quot;Blower&quot;′s crew exchanged recognition signals by flashing light with a B-24 Liberator four-engine search plane which passed overhead, an event commemorated by the war diary entry &quot;They are damn big and look bigger when they are headed in on you.&quot;

&quot;Blower&quot; headed for the Philippine Islands on 23 May 1945, completing her patrol when she moored alongside the submarine tender in Subic Bay on the coast of Luzon on 24 May 1945.

=====Third war patrol=====

Following a two-week refit, &quot;Blower&quot;, now under the command of Lieutenant Commander Nelson P. Watkins, departed Subic Bay on 23 June 1945 to begin her third war patrol, bound for a patrol area in the Gulf of Siam She sighted Tenggol Island off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula on 28 June 1945 and began patrol operations there. She made rendezvous with the submarine on the night of 30 June 1945, and the two submarines agreed to coordinate their patrol coverage. Taking the area south of the island, &quot;Blower&quot; sighted an empty lifeboat on the morning of 1 July, sparking an impromptu target practice with the aft 40-millimeter gun. The crew fired eleven rounds, getting one hit at a range of , a result memorialized in the war diary as &quot;The practice was justified by the caliber of the shooting. Terrible.&quot; &quot;Blower&quot; then moved &quot;close aboard and let Gunnery Officer have a go at it with grenades. Result - sore arm. No damages. All in all a very sorry exhibition, so secured, leaving lifeboat bloody and sinking.&quot;

On 4 July 1945, the two submarines rendezvoused again to lay out a plan to investigate a ship sighting reported by patrol aircraft. Unfortunately, according to &quot;Blower&quot;′s war diarist, the aviators&#x27; plot &quot;of position showed ships anchored in the mountains.&quot; Just in case, the two submarines approached the coast of Japanese-occupied British Malaya and, as &quot;Blower&quot;′s war diarist reported laconically, &quot;had a good look at all possible anchorages and inasmuch as no ships were sighted zoomie [slang for &quot;aviator&quot;] position must have been correct.&quot; Later that day three of &quot;Blower&quot;′s lookouts spotted a periscope at a range of and closing. &quot;Blower&quot;′s war diarist later noted the crew were surprised no attack came as &quot;Blower&quot; dived to escape and wondered if their would-be assailant was friendly. The next day, the British submarine reported attacking a large Japanese submarine with no results, suggesting &quot;Blower&quot; had indeed made a lucky escape.

On the evening of 9 July 1945, after &quot;Blower&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Bluefish&quot;, the two submarines followed, then closed to attack two Japanese submarine chasers off the Malay coast. &quot;Bluefish&quot; sank one of them, but &quot;Blower&quot; broke off her attack run when the other submarine chaser turned away. The two submarines surfaced to try a gunnery attack, but the surviving submarine chaser fled into a minefield and escaped.

On 11 July 1945, &quot;Blower&quot; tried another night attack, this time against a medium-sized vessel she identified as either a cargo ship or an escort ship. She fired three torpedoes at a range of . Unfortunately, the first two torpedoes, according to &quot;Blower&quot;′s war diarist, &quot;leapt clear of the water and chased each other off in a direction not that of the target.&quot; The third torpedo missed ahead.

Standing eastward the following day to join a coordinated attack group led by the commanding officer of the submarine , &quot;Blower&quot; began patrolling near the Natuna Islands. On 15 July 1945, after tracking the Japanese submarine in the early hours of the morning, &quot;Blower&quot; fired four torpedoes at the zigzagging submarine from a range of . Instead of the expected &quot;blinding flash&quot; though, &quot;Blower&quot;′s war diarist wrote that ′the crew heard &quot;only a sickly thump followed shortly after by another thump, both loud enough to be heard throughout the boat. The first two had hit - duds.&quot; After a short drop down to avoid any torpedoes fired back down her torpedo track, &quot;Blower&quot; started up to fire her stern torpedo tubes but was shaken by three nearby explosions. Her sound operators reported fast screws nearby and, worried that a Japanese escort had shown up, stayed low until the presumed Japanese escort ship had moved off. Although unsure of what had happened, &quot;Blower&quot; radioed a contact report, and an hour later was rewarded by a terrific explosion over the horizon. This was followed shortly thereafter by a report from &quot;Bluefish&quot; that she had sunk .

Following this encounter, &quot;Blower&quot; shifted to the Java Sea near Batavia, but encountered only sailboats. Those contacts proved nerve-wracking nonetheless, as constant night radar contacts and poor visilibilty produced several near collisions. To make matters worse, &quot;Blower&quot; had at least one encounter with two unidentified Allied submarines, avoiding a friendly-fire incident when she flashed a recognition signal to them. Seeing that the area was overly crowded, &quot;Blower&quot; passed south through the Sunda Strait to patrol in the Indian Ocean off the south coast of Java. At 13:45, the executive officer remarked &quot;Well, the only thing we need to make the patrol complete is to get bombed.&quot; Fifteen minutes later, lookouts spotted an Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi G4M bomber (Allied reporting name &quot;Betty&quot;) that dropped two bombs near &quot;Blower&quot;.

With no targets in sight and low on fuel, &quot;Blower&quot; headed east and arrived in Fremantle, Australia, on 28 July 1945, completing her patrol. She was still at Fremantle when hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945, bringing World War II to a close.

====Post-World War II====

&quot;Blower&quot; received orders to proceed from Fremantle to Sydney, Australia, and then head for Guam in the Mariana Islands, which she reached on 16 September 1945. She remained at Guam for three months, carrying out a series of training exercises in the Mariana and Caroline Islands. On 11 January 1946, she got underway to proceed to Pearl Harbor. She then continued to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 30 January 1946.

From 1946 through 1949, &quot;Blower&quot; was attached to the Submarine Force of the United States Pacific Fleet. She operated from San Diego, conducting torpedo exercises, submerged sound school operations, and general training programs. She made a cruise to Yokosuka, Japan, that began on 14 October 1946, and participated in fleet operations near Guam and Saipan before returning to San Diego on 3 January 1947. &quot;Blower&quot; conducted local operations from San Diego for the rest of 1947, and underwent an overhaul in San Francisco, California, in early 1948. She departed Bremerton, Washington, on 2 August 1948 and, in company with the submarine , cruised to the waters of the Territory of Alaska, collecting radar and sonar tracking data along the edge of the Arctic ice pack in the Chukchi Sea for use in future submarine operations in the Arctic. Returning to San Diego on 25 September 1948, she resumed routine operations in the Pacific Ocean.

In February 1950, &quot;Blower&quot; was selected for transfer to Turkey under the terms of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. On 12 February 1950, she departed San Diego bound for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at League Island in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she arrived on 3 March 1950 to begin an overhaul. Upon completion of the shipyard work, she proceeded to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, where she arrived on 27 September 1950 and immediately began training her prospective Turkish crew. &quot;Blower&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London on 16 November 1950. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1950.

On 16 November 1950, the day of her decommissioning, &quot;Blower&quot; was transferred to Turkey, which commissioned her in the Turkish Naval Forces as the second TCG &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;, named for the Battle of Dumlupınar of 26 to 30 August 1922, and last battle of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 and the final and defining battle of the Turkish War of Independence. &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; served in the Turkish Naval Forces for almost three years.

Late on the evening on 3 April 1953, &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; and the Turkish submarine TCG &quot;Birinci İnönü&quot; (S330) (also sometimes written &quot;TCG &quot;İnönü I&quot;&quot;) started their voyage home to the Turkish Armed Forces Naval Yards in Gölcük, Turkey, after completing their participation in a regular North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) training exercise in the Mediterranean. On 4 April 1953 at 02:10, they entered the Dardanelles (also known as the Çanakkale Strait) en route Gölcük. Ninety-six men were aboard &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;, 88 of them below deck and eight on deck.

There was a heavy mist in the strait that night, which severely limited visibility. Lieutenant Hüseyin İnkaya was on deck duty when something unseen suddenly and violently struck &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; off Nara Burnu (English &quot;Cape Nara&quot;), the narrowest ( and deepest ( point of the Dardanelles, as well as the point where the currents are the strongest at up to , versus elsewhere in the strait. The force of the impact threw the eight crew members on deck overboard. &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;′s propellers killed two of them, while another drowned in the ensuing commotion.

The Swedish cargo ship had collided with &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;, ramming her on her starboard side in her bow torpedo room. &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; started to take on water in her forward compartments. The collision severed most communications and knocked out &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;′s electrical power. The 88 men below decks, seeing that &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; was taking on water from the bow, tried to reach the stern to seek shelter in the aft torpedo room, but many of them perished in the rapidly rising waters. Of the 88, only 22 were able to reach and lock themselves in the stern torpedo compartment. &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; sank within minutes due to the scale of the damage and a subsequent explosion in her central compartment. The survivors trapped in the stern torpedo room released an emergency communications buoy in the hope of signaling rescuers on the surface.

Shortly after the collision, a small motorboat that had heard the impact alerted a Turkish Government customs ship anchored nearby in the harbor at Eceabat to the incident. When the customs ship reached the site of the accident, her crew saw that &quot;Naboland&quot; had lowered her lifeboats and deployed life jackets to find and rescue survivors from &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; and was firing flares to alert rescuers and guide them to the scene. The customs ship took on board the five sailors from &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; who had survived being thrown off her deck and took them to local hospitals. Three of the hospitalized men died of their injuries on 5 April 1953.

Nobody on the surface was aware of the number of casualties at the time, and authorities called the Turkish submarine rescue ship &quot;Kurtaran&quot; to the scene. While rescuers waited for &quot;Kurtaran&quot; to arrive, the sun began to rise, the heavy mist started to clear, and the customs ship spotted the emergency communications buoy the trapped sailors had released. Selim Yoludüz, a second engineer aboard the customs ship, reached for the telephone located inside the communications buoy and read the inscription on it, which said, &quot;The submarine TCG &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;, commissioned in the Turkish Navy, has sunk here. Open the hatch to establish contact with the submarine.&quot; Following these directions, Yoludüz established contact with the sunken submarine. From &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;′s torpedo room, Lieutenant Selami Özben informed Yoludüz that &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; was listing 15 degrees to starboard after colliding with a cargo ship, and that the surviving 22 members of crew were locked away in the stern torpedo compartment with no power or supplies. Yoludüz, in turn, informed Lieutenant Özben that &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; had sunk in the Nara Bay area off Çanakkale and was lying at a depth of approximately , that the rescue ship &quot;Kurtaran&quot; was on her way, and that they would do everything they could to rescue the trapped sailors.

&quot;Kurtaran&quot; arrived at the scene at approximately 11:00 on 4 April 1953, about nine hours after the collision, with Admiral Sadık Altıncan and Governor Safaeddin Karnakçı aboard. Throughout the ensuing rescue operation, Özben kept in regular contact with Yoludüz, as well as the admiral commanding the Çanakkale Sea Forces, Zeki Adar, and the second captain of the submarine &quot;Birinci İnönü&quot;, Suat Tezcan. The rescuers implored the trapped sailors to keep their spirits up, and advised them to refrain from talking, singing, or smoking in order to preserve oxygen.

Despite numerous attempts by engineers, divers, and United States Navy and Turkish Naval Forces vessels, rescue efforts did not succeed due to the strong currents at the scene and the depth of &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;, and the morale of the trapped crewmen began to decline. By the afternoon of 4 April 1953, the voices of the 22 sailors were quieting and were being replaced by prayers. Finally, the rescue workers told the sailors, &quot;Gentlemen, now you can talk, you can sing, you can even smoke.&quot; Özben responded with a final &quot;For our country,&quot; and at approximately 15:00 on 4 April, the cable connecting the communications buoy to &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; broke, disconnecting the only means of communication between the surface and the men trapped aboard &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;.

Despite the loss of communications, rescue operations continued, attracting widespread attention from the Turkish public. On 7 April 1953, three days after the accident, it was declared that the rising carbon dioxide levels inside &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; would by then have killed any surviving crewmen, and the rescue operation was abandoned. At 15:00 on 8 April 1953, a memorial ceremony for the crew of &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; took place aboard the ship &quot;Başaran&quot;.

In all, 94 submariners died in the accident due to drowning, bodily injury, or carbon dioxide poisoning. The wreck of &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; still lies at a depth of , with the remains of 88 men still aboard.

====In culture====
The tragedy of &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; has inspired numerous songs and tributes in honor of the lost sailors. It is commemorated every year in Turkey on 4 April.

<doc id="1127824" wikidata="Q936413" url="?curid=1127824" title="Donkey Kong Jungle Beat">
<text>is a 2004 platform and score-attack game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It follows the gorilla Donkey Kong as he sets out to defeat a series of evil kings to conquer the jungle. &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; is designed for use with the DK Bongos, a bongo drum-style GameCube controller created for the &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; (2003) rhythm game. The player controls Donkey Kong through various side-scrolling levels as he collects bananas, swings on vines, chains combos, rides animals, and defeats enemies and bosses.

The debut project of the 65-member Nintendo EAD Tokyo, &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; development began around July 2003, after Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Nintendo should commission a new &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game. Development was led by director Yoshiaki Koizumi and producer Takao Shimizu, who sought to create a simple, accessible game in contrast to more complex contemporary games. Koizumi conceived a game that used the DK Bongos instead of a standard gamepad to control the player character, and applied lessons he had learned from previous projects during development. Because the tone differed from previous &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games, the team excluded most of the franchise&#x27;s existing elements and characters.

&quot;Jungle Beat&quot; was released in Japan in December 2004 and in the West in 2005 as the first major &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game since &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; (1999). It received mostly positive reviews from critics, who complimented its use of the DK Bongos, with praise for its visuals and level design, but was criticized for its short length and low difficulty level. Nintendo EAD Tokyo went on to develop the critically acclaimed &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; (2007), which refined concepts that were introduced in &quot;Jungle Beat&quot;. &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; was rereleased as part of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;New Play Control!&quot; line of GameCube ports for the Wii in 2008; the port contains reworked controls and levels. This version was released as a downloadable game for the Wii U in 2016.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; is a 2.5D platform game. Like previous &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games, the player controls the gorilla Donkey Kong through a series of side-scrolling levels. It features a simple plot: Donkey Kong sets out on a journey to defeat a series of evil kings attempting to conquer the jungle. While it is compatible with a traditional GameCube controller, &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; is designed for use with the DK Bongos, a controller that resembles a pair of bongo drums and was previously used for the &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; (2003) music game. Hitting the individual drums causes Donkey Kong to move; the player hits both drums to jump and claps in front of the DK Bongos&#x27; built-in microphone to send a shockwave. The player uses these controls to perform backflips, slap the terrain, swing on vines, and jump between walls.

As the player starts the game, they select a kingdom to explore; there are 16 kingdoms in total, which become available as the campaign progresses. Each kingdom features three levels: two main platforming stages and one boss fight. Unlike traditional platformers, &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; contains score-attack elements: the goal is not simply to get to the end of the level, but to get as many points, or &quot;beats&quot;, as possible. Beats are obtained by grabbing bananas, which are scattered throughout levels or can be summoned by defeating enemies and interacting with objects. The player performs combos in midair by grabbing bananas; a counter initiates and rises with each banana acquired before landing. Beats also serve as Donkey Kong&#x27;s health, as the player loses beats if they are damaged by enemies or hazards. If the beat count reaches zero, the player receives a game over and must restart the kingdom from the beginning.

Similar to &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994), certain levels feature rideable animals, each providing a unique attribute: squirrels allow Donkey Kong to glide slowly through the air; wildebeests charge right continuously and plow through objects that provide bananas; orcas carry Donkey Kong through water; and birds allow Donkey Kong to fly. Between most levels, there is a short minigame where the player must tap the bongos as fast as they can to earn extra bananas. The final level of each kingdom contains a boss fight against a large enemy. The game features four types of bosses, each of which must be defeated in a different manner: gorillas must be taken on in a &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;-style arena; tanks resembling elephants must be defeated by throwing back bombs that they fire; warthogs must be defeated by throwing coconuts at them; and birds must be defeated by destroying the giant egg they are carrying.

At the end of each kingdom, the total sum of beats (after deducting any damage taken during the boss fight) is tallied. The player earns a crest for completing a kingdom, with additional crests earned by obtaining more beats. Crests are required to play new kingdoms, and clearing all the kingdoms in a section unlocks the next set of kingdoms. Players can revisit earlier kingdoms to earn more beats and crests.

==Development==
&quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; was the debut project of Nintendo EAD Tokyo, a game development division of Japanese video game company Nintendo that was formed in 2003 with a 65-person team. Nintendo started planning to develop a new &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game internally when the series&#x27; developer Rare was acquired by Microsoft in September 2002, and development began for the GameCube shortly after EAD Tokyo was established in July 2003. Division heads Yoshiaki Koizumi and Takao Shimizu—who had previously led development on Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; (2002)—respectively served as director and producer. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka also served as producers, while &quot;Sunshine&quot; programmer Koichi Hayashida was the assistant director and contributed to some level design. &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; was the first major &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game since Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; (1999), although it was intended as &quot;more of a stopgap than a permanent status quo&quot; for the franchise.

The &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; concept originated at Nintendo EAD&#x27;s primary office in Kyoto, shortly before staff moved to Tokyo to form the new division, when Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Koizumi and Shimizu develop a new &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game. Koizumi and Shimizu were presented the DK Bongos during a meeting regarding &quot;Donkey Konga&quot;, and Koizumi conceived the central idea for &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; upon seeing players&#x27; reactions to using them. Koizumi explained to EAD Tokyo that he wanted to prioritize what players would experience over how functional the game would be. He said that &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; &quot;show[s] how we take experiences with our own families at home, or in places other than work, and bring those experiences back to our work&quot;. Koizumi, who had handled character controls and virtual camera systems on previous projects, had been &quot;hearing from many people&quot; that controlling characters in modern games was becoming challenging and harbored a desire to create a game with a simple control scheme that did not rely on a traditional gamepad.

Using the DK Bongos presented some challenges; since the controller restricted the player&#x27;s movements, EAD Tokyo had to conceive new game mechanics as a workaround. The developers chose to change the camera angle when Donkey Kong encounters an enemy—altering the control scheme as a result—to keep his abilities and the action varied. The automatic camera also allowed Koizumi to avoid camera problems he found in previous 3D games that he had worked on. EAD Tokyo prioritized simplicity; Shimizu said that because contemporary video games took considerable time to complete and lost appeal if an individual had to stop playing, &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; levels were designed to take between five and ten minutes without any shortcuts. He felt that the game would appeal to a busy person because it did not contain long save or load times.

The developers reflected the simplicity through the story, which only features Donkey Kong trying to be &quot;the best&quot;; they sought to narrate through the gameplay instead. Tonally, Koizumi wanted &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; to be extravagant and hoped it &quot;would make even bystanders giggle and enjoy themselves&quot;. Because the tone differed from previous &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games, EAD Tokyo excluded most of the series&#x27; recurring characters and elements, aside from Donkey Kong himself and bananas. Koizumi felt this would allow &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; to stand on its own and reflect the style of EAD Tokyo. Miyamoto supervised EAD Tokyo and reviewed &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; content throughout development, similar to the role he played during the development of Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; in 1994. Mahito Yokota composed the soundtrack, his first project as a composer after joining Nintendo in 2003. Like he did on &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot; (2002), sound programmer Masafumi Kawamura attempted to synchronize the music with the gameplay, like when Donkey Kong jumps.

Although the game is 2D, Shimizu noted development was still difficult due to technical restraints. EAD Tokyo aimed to release &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; during Japan&#x27;s 2004–2005 winter season, which presented a considerable challenge. During a showing at the Nintendo World event in November 2004, Koizumi and the team carefully observed player feedback and used it to polish the game shortly before its release. The team was ultimately able to complete the game in time for the 2004 Christmas shopping season. A two-player multiplayer game mode was planned, but did not appear in the finished product.

==Release==
Nintendo announced &quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; in May 2004 and showcased it at E3 2004 that month. Nintendo&#x27;s showing was considered &quot;[b]old, energetic, full of attitude and unexpected surprises&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot; described &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; as &quot;[t]he sleeper hit of the show&quot; and wrote that attendees did not want to stop playing its presented demo. After the showing, in July &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; won two Game Critics Awards—selected by journalists from publications such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and CNN—for &quot;Best Original Game&quot; and &quot;Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game&quot;. It was also showcased at Nintendo World, which took place in five locations across Japan in November.

&quot;Jungle Beat&quot; was released in Japan on December 16, 2004, in Europe on February 4, 2005, and in North America on March 14. It was the first video game to receive a rating of E10+ from the Entertainment Software Rating Board. It was released as both a standalone game and a bundle with the DK Bongos. The European version was released on the same day as the Game Boy Advance &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game &quot;DK: King of Swing&quot;. To promote the North American release, Nintendo sent 20 individuals dressed up as apes to participate in the 20th Los Angeles Marathon, which took place on March 6. The individuals wore &quot;Jungle Beat&quot;-branded clothing, carried DK Bongos, and chanted the game&#x27;s title as they ran. &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; was released when Donkey Kong had mostly been relegated to spin-offs and supporting roles in other Nintendo franchises, following Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Rare.

&quot;Jungle Beat&quot; did not perform well commercially. In a 2007 interview with MTV, Nintendo of America writer Nate Bihldorff said that he was &quot;still pissed that not enough people bought &quot;Jungle Beat&quot;&quot;. MTV opined that &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; &quot;required a Mario-size leap of faith. It&#x27;s one thing to ask people to control a tennis game with a controller shaped like a remote control, but to run away from a giant lizard and beat up an evil ape using bongos? It&#x27;s a hard sell and wasn&#x27;t a very successful one&quot;. MTV noted that the DK Bongos were introduced before instrument-controlled games like &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; became popular, suggesting audiences were apprehensive towards the concept. Furthermore, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; fans saw &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; as &quot;merely an aside to the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; platforming saga&quot; rather than the return to the style of Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; trilogy (1994–1996) that they wanted.

===&quot;New Play Control!&quot; version===

Nintendo rereleased &quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; as one of the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; games, a product line comprising seven updated ports of GameCube games for the Wii. The rerelease, &quot;New Play Control! Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot;, was released in Japan on December 11, 2008, as the line&#x27;s first release. This was followed by a North American release on May 4, 2009, and a European one on June 5. It was also released as a downloadable game on the Wii U&#x27;s eShop on November 3, 2016.

In lieu of the DK Bongos, the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; version of &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; is controlled using the Wii Remote, using its Nunchuk accessory to control Donkey Kong&#x27;s movement and its motion detection feature to clap. To accommodate the more traditional control scheme, the level designs were altered to include more obstacles, and players do not have to collect crests to progress. It also replaces the banana-based health meter with a more traditional life system, adds a boss rush mode, and supports widescreen television displays.

==Reception==
&quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews across both its releases. Most reviewers considered it unique and fun to play but rather short given the retail price. It was praised for its wide appeal; possessing both a simplicity targeted at new gamers, and a complex, skill-oriented combo system to attract more hardcore gamers. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the GameCube version&#x27;s graphics, saying that &quot;DK&#x27;s fur makes &quot;StarFox Adventures&quot; models look primitive&quot;. Criticisms include the game&#x27;s short length, despite the replayability offered by the score system in levels. There were also complaints of repetitive boss fights, as the same four bosses are used several times throughout the game with limited features to distinguish them. One of the primary criticisms, however, was the lack of past characters and elements from Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; games. Despite these criticisms it was rated the 95th best game made on a Nintendo System in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 Games list.

Non video-game publications also praised the GameCube version. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a favorable review and called it &quot;wildly entertaining&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; gave it four stars out of five, praising the graphics, environments and gameplay, but complained of the game&#x27;s short length. &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; gave it three stars out of four and complimented the use of bongos in the game. Common Sense Media gave the Wii version four stars out of five. Although positive to the game, they considered more as rental than purchase due to its short length.

==Legacy==
EAD Tokyo went on to develop &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; (2007) for the Wii, which was acclaimed as one of the greatest video games of all time and became one of the bestselling Wii games. &quot;Galaxy&quot; refined concepts that EAD Tokyo introduced in &quot;Jungle Beat&quot;; Koizumi reflected that &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; provided him with the experience to create engaging gameplay with a simple control scheme in &quot;Galaxy&quot;. In fact, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; said that &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; became more compelling when viewed as a &quot;Galaxy&quot; prototype, with shared sound effects and a &quot;gleeful turnover of ideas [that] reeks of &quot;Galaxy&quot; scattershot fun-bursts&quot;. &quot;Destructoid&quot; said the connections between &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; and &quot;Galaxy&quot; were obvious when considering &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; &quot;level of imagination and surrealism... [which] wasn&#x27;t present in the [&quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;] games&quot;, while &quot;Kotaku&quot; noted further parallels between level tropes in &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot; (2010).

After &quot;Jungle Beat&quot;, the DK Bongos only saw use in two &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; sequels. Support for &quot;Odama&quot; (2006) was dropped prior to release, while a planned DK Bongos-controlled racing game, &quot;DK Bongo Blast&quot;, was released on the Wii as &quot;Donkey Kong Barrel Blast&quot; in 2007 without support. The &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series did not receive another major installment until 2010, when the Retro Studios-developed &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot; was released for the Wii. Retrospectively, journalists have cited &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; as one of the best &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games. Jeremy Parish, writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, considered it the franchise&#x27;s best game behind &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1994) for the Game Boy, summarizing it as &quot;a one-of-a-kind thing that really shouldn&#x27;t work but absolutely does&quot;. &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; has been referenced in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, a series of crossover fighting games. &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008) includes a stage based on &quot;Jungle Beat&quot; Rumble Falls level, while one of Donkey Kong&#x27;s attacks in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018)—in which he rapidly punches adversaries—is a tribute to &quot;Jungle Beat&quot;.

<doc id="1127826" wikidata="Q2898163" url="?curid=1127826" title="Stanislaus National Forest">
<text>Stanislaus National Forest is a U.S. national forest which manages of land in four counties in the Sierra Nevada in Northern California. It was established on February 22, 1897, making it one of the oldest national forests. It was named after the Stanislaus River.

==Geography==
The forest is located primarily in eastern Tuolumne County, adjacent to the northwestern part of Yosemite National Park, but parts of it extend (in descending order of forestland area) into Southern Alpine County, Northern Mariposa County and Eastern Calaveras County. Forest headquarters are located in Sonora, California. There are local ranger district offices in Groveland, Hathaway Pines, and Pinecrest.

The Emigrant Wilderness is located entirely within its boundaries. Portions of the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness, including the Dardanelles Cone, and the Mokelumne Wilderness are also within the Stanislaus National Forest.

==Features==
It contains 78 lakes and of rivers and streams. It has of non-motorized trails and of roads, of which are paved.

The forest contains some of old growth, which includes Lodgepole Pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;), Jeffrey Pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;) and White Fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;).

==Recreation==
The proximity of the Stanislaus National Forest to the San Francisco Bay Area makes it a popular recreation destination. The volcanic and granite formations in the wilderness exist alongside heavy cattle grazing. Whitewater rafting and kayaking can be found in the wild and scenic Tuolumne River and Cherry Creek. Other rivers flowing out of the Stanislaus include the Clavey River, the Stanislaus River, as well as the Merced River along the southern boundary.

Two ski resorts, Dodge Ridge and Bear Valley, operate here under a special use permit.

== 2013 Rim Fire ==
The Rim Fire was ignited on the Stanislaus National Forest in August 2013, and eventually grew to become the third-largest fire in California history. The fire was named after the Rim of the World Vista on California State Route 120, where the fire was initially reported.

<doc id="1127832" wikidata="Q2609624" url="?curid=1127832" title="Angels Cry (album)">
<text>Angels Cry is the debut album of Brazilian metal band Angra. It was released in 1993 and recorded in Germany at Kai Hansen&#x27;s studios in Hamburg.

The opening track is a short rendition of the first movement of Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 8&quot;, commonly known as his &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot;. In addition, the title track features a brief arrangement of &quot;Caprice no. 24&quot; by Niccolò Paganini, whereas &quot;Evil Warning&quot; features a brief arrangement of &quot;Winter&quot; by Antonio Vivaldi. The opening of the track &quot;Never Understand&quot; features a brief arrangement of the song &quot;Asa Branca&quot; by Luiz Gonzaga. The opening section of the closing track &quot;Lasting Child&quot;, entitled &quot;The Parting Words&quot;, is an adaptation of the theme of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Variations sérieuses&quot;, Op. 54.

==Production and recording==
When commenting on the production and recording of the album, vocalist Andre Matos said that recording the album was difficult due to the inexperience of him and his bandmates, and also due to the difference of musical influences between them and the producers. He also referred to the recording as &quot;an exile&quot;:

Producer Charlie Bauerfeind was not confident that drummer and co-founder Marcos Antunes would be skillful enough for the music he expected to put in the album, so he told the band they could either fire him and hire Alex Holzwarth as a session musician or use electronic drums - or otherwise he would leave the project. The band decided to do as he said and replaced Antunes with Holzwarth, a decision Matos regards as being very difficult.

One of the songs, however, was performed by a different drummer: Kate Bush cover &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, played by then Gamma Ray drummer Thomas Nack. Matos said Nack was a big fan of Bush and &quot;could play those lines perfectly&quot;.

The inlays and photo shoots for the album display drummer Ricardo Confessori, but he would only join the band after its recording. Antunes appears on the back sleeve and inlays of the Japanese first press of the album instead of Confessori.

<text>Kurapaty (, ) is a wooded area on the outskirts of Minsk, Belarus, where a vast number of people were executed between 1937 and 1941 during the Great Purge by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD and in particular, during the Stalinist repressions in Belarus.

The exact count of victims is uncertain, as NKVD archives are classified in Belarus. According to various sources, the number of people who perished in Kurapaty is estimated to be at least 30,000 (according to the Attorney General of BSSR Tarnaŭski), up to 100,000 people (according to &quot;Belarus&quot; reference book), from 102,000 to 250,000 people (according to the article by Zianon Pazniak in the &quot;Litaratura i Mastactva&quot; newspaper), 250,000 people (according to Polish historian and professor of University of Wrocław ), and more (according to the British historian Norman Davies). Most of the victims were the Belarusian intelligentsia.

In 2004, Kurapaty mass graves were included in the register of the Cultural Properties of Belarus as a first-category cultural heritage.

==Discovery and remembrance==
The discovery by historian Zianon Paźniak and exhumation of the remains in 1988 gave added momentum to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in Belarus in the last years of the Soviet Union before it was dissolved. There have been investigations by both the Soviet, and Belarusian governments, which have been conclusive as to the perpetrators were Soviet NKVD. This is based on former NKVD members&#x27; confessions and the eyewitness testimonies of 55 villagers, from villages such as Cna, Cna-Yodkava, Drazdova, Padbaloccie and others, who gave evidence that NKVD brought people in trucks and executed them during 1937–1941.

President of the United States Bill Clinton visited Kurapaty forest in 1994, when he came to Belarus with a &quot;thank you&quot; visit after Belarus agreed to transfer their post-Soviet nuclear weapons to Russia. Clinton gifted a small granite monument &quot;To Belarusians from the American people&quot;, perhaps the first post-Soviet cultural artifact from the U.S. on the Belarusian soil. The monument was damaged three times by unidentified vandals, but subsequently restored.

In 2001, when the Kurapaty site was threatened by a planned widening of the Minsk Ring Road, youth from the Belarusian Popular Front, Zubr, and smaller organizations occupied the site and sat out a bitter winter in tents, trying to halt the road construction, however with no success.

On October 29, 2004, the Jewish community of Belarus installed a monument in memory of the Jews and other nationals who were murdered in Kurapaty forest. The brown granite stone has two inscriptions, in Yiddish and in Belarusian: &quot;To our fellow-believers—Jews, Christians and the Muslims—the victims of Stalinism from the Belarusian Jews.&quot;

Each year in November, on Dziady (the All Saints or the day when Belarusians commemorate their deceased forefathers), hundreds of people visit this site of crimes of Soviet political repression.

<text>Gerard Ross &#x27;Toys&#x27; Norton (7 September 1915 – 29 October 2004) was a South African recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Educated at Selborne College, East London (where he acquired his nickname) he was a keen sportsman excelling at cricket, rugby and tennis.
After school, he joined Barclays Bank at Umtata. After a short spell in the Johannesburg branch of the bank, he returned to East London. The hostel at Selborne College is named in his honour.

==Military career==
Norton&#x27;s peacetime military training was done with the Middelandse Regiment, but after the outbreak of the Second World War he was transferred to the Kaffrarian Rifles in East London. In 1943, he transferred in to the 1/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (later the Royal Hampshire Regiment).

On 31 August 1944 during the attack on Montegridolfo, Italy, Lieutenant Norton&#x27;s platoon was pinned down by heavy fire. On his own initiative and with complete disregard for his own safety, he advanced alone and attacked the first machine-gun emplacement, killing the crew of three. He then went on to the second position containing two machine-guns and 15 riflemen, and wiped out both machine-gun nests, killing or taking prisoner the remainder of the enemy. Throughout these attacks he was continuously under fire from a self-propelled gun, nevertheless he calmly went on to lead his platoon against the remaining enemy positions.

The award of the Victoria Cross was gazetted on 24 October 1944.

He later achieved the rank of Captain.

==Later life==
After the war he moved to Rhodesia, where he ran a large tobacco plantation and became a Rhodesian citizen.
Gerard Ross Norton died on 29 October 2004.

<doc id="1127842" wikidata="Q6691928" url="?curid=1127842" title="Love of Diagrams">
<text>Love of Diagrams are an Australian indie rock band formed in 2001. Their sound is characterised by a mix of energetic drumming, angular guitar and bass riffs, and call-and-response vocals.

== History ==

Love of Diagrams were formed in Melbourne in 2001 by Monika Fikerle on drums, Luke Horton on guitar and vocals, and Antonia Sellbach on vocals and bass guitar. The trio were described by Heather Phares of AllMusic, as providing &quot;a fiery, angular sound that recalls post-punk greats like Siouxsie and the Banshees and Pylon.&quot; Locally, they &quot;made a name for themselves with their kinetic live act and consistent touring.&quot;

In 2003, they released their debut instrumental album, &quot;The Target Is You&quot;, on local-based Unstable Ape Records, which received much critical acclaim. They then played an extensive tour throughout Europe and Japan. Whilst touring across Australia, they supported international bands including, Death Cab for Cutie, Electrelane, Les Savy Fav, Stereolab, The Rogers Sisters and Sonic Youth.

They released their first extended play, &quot;We Got Communication&quot;, in 2004 which is their first work to feature vocals. Its five tracks included three new songs and two remixes of other tracks. Amazon.com editorial reviewer opined &quot;the new vocal material certainly matches the high energy of their original instrumental work.&quot; Two tracks from the EP were also released on a 7&quot; vinyl single, &quot;No Way Out&quot;, in the UK through The Passport Label, and the band played a handful of London shows in November 2005. &quot;No Way Out&quot; was used on an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot; in season three, &quot;The Game Plan&quot;.

Their self-titled EP was released in September 2006 on Unstable Ape Records, in the United States in January 2007 via Matador Records, and the United Kingdom in February. Brian Howe of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; rated it at 6.2 out of 10 and explained, &quot;[the group] have met what seems to be their goal: to resurrect the still-awesome power of classic UK post-punk for the umpteenth time. [However, the] visceral thrills are accompanied by the nagging frustration that, out of the countless ways you can combine guitars and drums, so many bands are choosing this exact one.&quot;

Whilst in the US, they recorded their second album, &quot;Mosaic&quot;, in Chicago with producer Bob Weston, which was their first studio album for Matador Records. It was released in Australia in February 2007 and everywhere else in April. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Roque Strew rated it at 7.6 and declared, &quot;With mad scientific precision, they clone that factory-town aura of blankness and unrest, as well as the bohemian suspicions of structure and prettiness for its own sake.&quot; The band returned to the US to support tours for Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and Enon and two performances at SXSW festival in Austin, Texas which were the highlight for English disc jockey Steve Lamacq.

Their third album, &quot;Nowhere Forever&quot;, was produced by Ryan Hadlock at Bear Creek Studios in Seattle and a companion 7&quot; single, &quot;Forever&quot;, were both released in August 2009.

<text>Aquinas College is a private Roman Catholic liberal arts college in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids formed it as the Novitiate Normal School in 1886. It has also been known as Sacred Heart College, Maywood College, and Catholic Junior College. The college has more than 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students and offers 61 majors, awarding bachelor&#x27;s degrees and master&#x27;s degrees. Alicia Cordoba is the ninth and current president of the college.

==History==
The Congregation of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans), today commonly known as the &quot;Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids&quot;, led by Mother Aquinata Fiegler, OP, founded the Novitiate Normal School in Traverse City, Michigan in 1886. The school&#x27;s mission was to educate young women who had yet to make their vows in the Order (i.e., novices), to be parochial school teachers throughout Michigan. It trained and sent forth numerous sister teachers successfully. In 1911, the school was transferred to Grand Rapids, along with the motherhouse of the sisters, under an invitation of the bishop of the young Diocese of Grand Rapids.

In response to the need for their sister teachers to hold baccalaureate degrees, in 1922 the sisters reorganized the Novitiate Normal School as Sacred Heart College and also commenced admitting lay women. The State of Michigan granted a charter to award two-year degrees to women in the new college in the same year. The site of the new college was transferred to the newly erected motherhouse of the Sisters on East Fulton Street, in the margins of Grand Rapids. 

At some time between 1922 and 1931 it was renamed as Marywood College. In 1931, it was reorganized as Catholic Junior College, transferred to a site on Ransom Street adjacent to the Grand Rapids Public Library, and became the first Roman Catholic college in the United States governed by women religious to become coeducational. Bishop Joseph G. Pinten of Grand Rapids instigated the reform to admit men alongside women. At that time it awarded two-year degrees.

In 1939, Catholic Junior College added a third year to its curriculum. The college began awarding four-year baccalaureate degrees and was renamed Aquinas College in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas and its founder, Mother Aquinata Fiegler, OP, in 1940, but the articles of incorporation to legally effect the institutional change were not filed with the State of Michigan until 1941. In 1945, Mother Euphrasia Sullivan, OP executed for the college the purchase of the Holmdene Mansion, erected by Edward Lowe in 1908, and its arboreal lands, at 1607 Robinson Road, bordering East Fulton Street. The college relocated to the former Lowe estate where it is sited to this day. The North Central Association accredited it in 1946.

In 1948 students instituted a chapter of the Dominican Third (Secular) Order (tertiaries; TOP). In May 1950 the outdoor Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima was dedicated, in memory of the members of Aquinas College who sacrificed their lives in the Second World War, after a student and alumni campaign of two years.

The 1950s and 1960s were a period of great growth and construction and during them, the college abandoned and sold the original campus on Ransom Street. In 1955 the new Administration Building, now the &quot;Academic Building&quot;, was erected.

In 1974 the college became legally independent of the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids. In 1975 the name of the athletic teams was changed from the &quot;Tommies&quot; to the &quot;Saints&quot;, under a student poll, because African American members had been racially ridiculed as &quot;Toms&quot;.

In 1977 the college was accredited to award its first graduate degree, the Master of Management in business, which was distinct from the conventional Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree awarded by other institutions because it was primarily based on the humanities and not mathematics. In 1993 the college awarded its first doctorate, albeit &quot;honoris causa&quot;.

Also in 1997, the college officially named its mascot, a St. Bernard dog, &quot;Nelson&quot; in honor of President Paul Nelson, who retired that year. In 1998 the college was reorganized into three schools, each led by a dean and subdivided into departments: the School of Education, the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the School of Management.

A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected by the Michigan History Division, Department of State in 1962. The inscription reads:

Aquinas had its beginning in 1887 as the Novitiate Normal School of the Dominican Sisters of Marywood. In 1922 it became Marywood College of the Sacred Heart. When the college was moved downtown in 1931, it became the coeducational Catholic Junior College. It began operating as a four-year college in 1940 and was named in honor of the great medieval theologian and philosopher, Saint Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas is primarily a liberal arts college. It was moved to this campus, the former Lowe estate, in 1945.

==Campus==

<doc id="1127850" wikidata="Q938836" url="?curid=1127850" title="One in a Million (Aaliyah album)">
<text>One in a Million is the second studio album by American singer Aaliyah. It was released on August 13, 1996, by Blackground Records and Atlantic Records. After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with her mentor R. Kelly following the success of her debut studio album, &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot; (1994), Aaliyah severed all ties with him as Blackground ended its partnership with Jive Records and signed a new distribution deal with Atlantic. Throughout that period of turmoil, Aaliyah began recording her second studio album with Sean Combs, who soon abandoned the project, prompting Aaliyah and her management to seek new collaborators. She subsequently began recording with producers such as Jermaine Dupri, Vincent Herbert, and Craig King, before meeting the previously unknown Timbaland and Missy Elliott, who quickly became the album&#x27;s primary contributors.

&quot;One in a Million&quot; is an R&amp;B, pop, and hip hop record experimenting with genres such as trip-hop, electronica, funk, and jungle music. Its lyrical themes predominantly address relationship circumstances, such as commitment, abstinence, and heartbreak. Upon its release, the album garnered generally positive reviews from music critics, mostly directed towards the innovative production and Aaliyah&#x27;s progressed vocal performance. It debuted at number 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 40,500 copies, before reaching number 18. Internationally, &quot;One in a Million&quot; peaked within the top 40 in Canada, Japan, and the UK. In June 1997, the album was certified double platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By 2011, it had sold over three million copies domestically and eight million worldwide.

&quot;One in a Million&quot; was heavily and extensively promoted with media appearances and live performances. It produced six singles—&quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot;, &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot;, &quot;One in a Million&quot;, &quot;4 Page Letter&quot;, &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; and &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot;—with &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; becoming the highest-peaking single at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Following its 2021 reissue, the album peaked at number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Retrospectively, it has been listed among the best albums of its era and genre by numerous publications and has been credited for re-establishing Aaliyah&#x27;s image, elevating careers of Timbaland and Elliott, and influencing mainstream music trends of the decades since release.

==Background and development==
After Aaliyah&#x27;s uncle Barry Hankerson obtained a distribution deal with Jive Records, he signed her to his label Blackground Records when she was 12 years old. He introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as the sole producer for her debut studio album &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot; (1994). A commercial success, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling three million copies in the United States and six million worldwide. To promote the album, Aaliyah embarked on a 1994–1995 world tour throughout the US, Europe, Japan, and South Africa. She soon faced allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, consequently ending her partnership with Jive and severing ties with Kelly. According to Aaliyah&#x27;s cousin and Blackground executive Jomo Hankerson, the music industry &quot;villainized&quot; Aaliyah for the scandal, which caused difficulty with enlisting producers for &quot;One in a Million&quot; &quot;except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy&quot;. Aaliyah reflected on the situation, saying she faced the adversity by refusing to give up singing as it was her passion, and that she used the support from her fans as inspiration for recording &quot;One in a Million&quot;.

Following her departure from Jive, Aaliyah transferred to Atlantic Records in June 1996, as Blackground signed a new distribution deal with the label. In a press release surrounding &quot;One in a Million&quot;, Aaliyah admitted to being &quot;a little anxious&quot; over transitioning from Jive to Atlantic and reformulating her musical style. However, considering the label switch and a new team of collaborators, the album was intended to re-establish Aaliyah&#x27;s fanbase and broaden her mainstream appeal, as it featured contributions from a wider range of producers–unlike &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;, which was produced solely by Kelly. While speaking with the Associated Press, Aaliyah claimed &quot;One in a Million&quot; showcased her growth over the prior two years, especially in her vocal range. She also noted that she took artistic risks by experimenting with different styles, and felt the record showcased divergent sides of her personality.

==Recording and production==
Production for &quot;One in a Million&quot; dates back to August 1995, when &quot;Billboard&quot; reported Aaliyah was starting work on a new album; initially, it was slated for an early 1996 release and was to be produced by Sean Combs, J. Dibbs, and Dave Hall. The album was executive produced by Atlantic Records&#x27; then-executive vice president Craig Kallman, Hankerson, and Aaliyah&#x27;s father and manager Michael Haughton. While speaking with &quot;Billboard&quot; about its development, Atlantic Records&#x27; product development director Eddie Santiago mentioned: &quot;We wanted Aaliyah to keep growing, so we didn&#x27;t want to have the same suspects on her new project&quot;. In the same interview, Aaliyah discussed the record&#x27;s direction: &quot;I wanted to maintain my smooth street musical image but wanted to be funky and hot yet sophisticated&quot;. With &quot;One in a Million&quot;, Aaliyah became more involved with crafting the material by taking co-writing credits and assisting in the creative direction. Of the original producers enlisted for the album, Dibbs&#x27; songwriting and production effort &quot;Giving You More&quot; was included on the final track listing. Contributions from the likes of Hall never materialized, and she recorded songs with Combs at his studio in Trinidad for a week but their collaborative material was never finished as Aaliyah abandoned her session with Combs in favor of recording with Dupri in Atlanta. &quot;I Gotcha&#x27; Back&quot; was the sole track created during sessions with Dupri to be included on &quot;One in a Million&quot;; it was written and produced by Dupri and Carl-So-Lowe within &quot;three to four days&quot;.

Vincent Herbert and Craig King were also approached to work on &quot;One in a Million&quot;; being among the earliest collaborators, they were allowed to &quot;build a sound&quot; for the record. Aaliyah recorded approximately eight songs with the pair at the Vanguard Studios in Detroit, two of which–&quot;Choosey Lover (Old School/New School)&quot; and &quot;Never Givin&#x27; Up&quot;–made the final track listing. &quot;Never Givin&#x27; Up&quot; was written by King and Monica Payne on the floor of the house he had just moved in, which inspired the first line &quot;Sitting here in this empty room&quot;. King wrote the song to show appreciation to the Isley Brothers and the Clark Sisters. Tavarius Polk&#x27;s earlier demo impressed Aaliyah and the producers so much he was kept on the track, which was originally conceived as Aaliyah&#x27;s solo song. She recorded the song in a single session, with the lights completely turned off in the recording booth so her face could not be seen. The Herbert–King sessions also produced a cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; and &quot;No Days Go By&quot;. Aaliyah elaborated on covering &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; saying: &quot;I wanted some real party songs, so when my uncle played me that [original track], I thought of how I could make it different. Slick Rick [who had been incarcerated] was on work release at the time, so Vincent &quot;got him on the song.&quot; She co-wrote and did vocal arrangements on &quot;No Days Go By&quot;, along with King and Rheji Burrell. The song is the album&#x27;s sole track for which Aaliyah received writing credits, and was included only on the Japanese edition of &quot;One in a Million&quot;. Diane Warren became a part of the album&#x27;s production as well, after reaching out to Kallman and expressing her desire to collaborate with Aaliyah. Warren&#x27;s intention in working with Aaliyah was to have her perform a song she would not have usually performed, in order to showcase another side of her artistry, which included displays of a wider vocal range. She wrote &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot;, which was originally set to be produced by Babyface. However, he was unable to finalize the work due to unforeseen circumstances, so he enlisted Daryl Simmons as his replacement. 

Aaliyah and Kallman promptly concluded it was important to find innovative producers who were not widely known to produce &quot;One in a Million&quot;, as the ultimate goal was to find Aaliyah her individual, artistry-defining sound. Kallman therefore started meeting with numerous obscure songwriters and producers including Timbaland. Kallman said that the point of their meeting became obvious when Timbaland first played beats: &quot;This doesn&#x27;t sound like anything that&#x27;s out there and really had its own super exciting and electric, &#x27;just dynamic properties.&#x27;&quot; Previously, Atlantic had received a demo from him and Missy Elliott, titled &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;. The label felt the track was too juvenile lyrically but enjoyed its structure and melody, hence it was sent to Aaliyah, who was impressed. Consequently, Timbaland and Elliott were flown to Detroit to work with her. Prior to Aaliyah meeting Timbaland and Elliot, she spoke with them over the phone and explained the musical direction that she wanted to pursue. During her initial meeting with the duo, Aaliyah said they were skeptical about if she would like their work, ultimately she did as she thought it was &quot;different&quot; and &quot;unique&quot;. Thereupon, the trio spent a week recording at the Vanguard Studios, with the first songs recorded being the title track and &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot;, before flying to Ithaca, New York to record at the Pyramid Studios. As primary collaborators on &quot;One in a Million&quot;, Timbaland and Elliott contributed to nine out of 17 tracks on the final track listing, providing ad-libs and rap vocals on their tracks in addition to songwriting and production.

==Music and lyrics==
In critical commentaries, &quot;One in a Million&quot; is classified as predominantly an R&amp;B, pop, and hip hop record. According to Micha Frazer-Carroll from &quot;The Independent&quot;, it &quot;had a bold, expansive vision, with tracks effortlessly bouncing from trip-hop to sensual slow jams to jungle beats&quot;. BET described the album as &quot;a unique fusion of R&amp;B, hip-hop, and electronic beats that was light-years ahead of its time&quot;. The album opens with the jungle-inspired intro &quot;Beats 4 Da Streets&quot;, on which Elliott invites Aaliyah and the listeners into &quot;the new world of funk&quot;, as echoing amid bells, blippy synths, and heavy bass are heard in the background.
The trip hop track &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot; was described as a suggestive-themed &quot;panting, minimalist controlled-blaze baby-maker&quot;. On &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot;, Aaliyah makes a promise to her new lover &quot;that his patience will be rewarded&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track is an ethereal club ballad with &quot;seductive&quot; trip hop, funk, electronica, and drum and bass influences. It incorporates &quot;shimmering&quot; synths and cricket noises within its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song sees Aaliyah expressing affection and devotion to her partner.
&quot;A Girl Like You&quot; has a &quot;standard 90s boom bap beat&quot;, on which Aaliyah &quot;holds her own&quot; against featured rapper Treach from Naughty by Nature. During the chorus, Aaliyah and Treach engage in a &quot;cute back-and-forth&quot;. The fifth track &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot; is a funk, pop, and hip hop song described by Connie Johnson from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;teasingly witchy&quot;. On the track, Aaliyah &quot;chide[s] a man for hitting on her when he already has a girlfriend&quot;, against heavy keyboard and organ instrumentation interspersed with live drums and a thumping bassline. The sixth and seventh tracks &quot;Choosey Lover (Old School/New School)&quot; and &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; are both covers, of songs originally performed by the Isley Brothers and Gaye, respectively. The former &quot;mimics the 1983 original faithfully&quot; for the first four minutes before transitioning into a contemporary-styled remix outro. On the latter, Aaliyah places her falsetto &quot;toe to toe against the liquid overlapping rhyme scheme of hip hop&#x27;s ultimate storyteller Slick Rick&quot;. On &quot;4 Page Letter&quot;, Aaliyah tells her &quot;crush to keep an eye out for the mailman&quot; because she has sent him a love letter, while recalling and following her parents&#x27; advice.

Dean Van Nguyen from &quot;The Independent&quot; described the ninth track &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gonna Be Alright&quot; as a &quot;carefree anthem for the summertime block party&quot;. Subsequent tracks &quot;Giving You More&quot; and the Tavarius Polk-assisted duet &quot;Never Givin&#x27; Up&quot; lyrically see Aaliyah portraying a &quot;reassuring lover&quot;. &quot;I Gotcha&#x27; Back&quot; is a &quot;jeep-friendly&quot; mid-tempo G-funk song containing an interpolation of &quot;Lean on Me&quot; by Bill Withers. The track showcases Aaliyah promising devotion to her potential boyfriend: &quot;When no one else is there / With me you can chill&quot;. The jungle-inspired ballad &quot;Heartbroken&quot; features drums that fill out space in between the low, shifting two-tone synth hums. Like its successor &quot;Never Comin&#x27; Back&quot;, it depicts Aaliyah opposing a negligent lover. The latter features Timbaland &quot;aping the sound of a live band vamping on a laid back groove&quot; as Aaliyah performs a &quot;call-and-response harmony routine with an imaginary concert audience over canned crowd noise&quot;. &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; is a pop-R&amp;B power ballad highlighting the protagonist&#x27;s vulnerability over heartbreak and betrayal.

==Marketing==
===Imagery===
The cover artwork and overall packaging for &quot;One in a Million&quot; were photographed by Marc Baptiste, who had previously photographed Aaliyah&#x27;s cover shoot for &quot;Seventeen&quot;. After the &quot;Seventeen&quot; shoot, the two crossed paths again, after mutual friend Kidada Jones introduced them at The Mercer Hotel. A month later, they met to discuss possible concepts for the artwork and after hearing his ideas, Aaliyah decided that she wanted to work with him. The 14-hour photo shoot for &quot;One in a Million&quot; occurred at various locations throughout New York City, with the cover itself being photographed at the Canal Street station late into the session. Baptiste wanted the concept for the artwork to have a &quot;street-chic vibe&quot;, as he wanted Aaliyah to have realism and be &quot;more approachable to an audience&quot;. The finished product saw Aaliyah staring down the camera, while wearing a power jacket and silver-rimmed glasses.

Throughout the promotional cycle for &quot;One in a Million&quot;, Aaliyah adapted a more mature and feminine image as opposed to her previous tomboy style, a switch quickly noticed by the public. She incorporated slimmer garments, such as bra tops, into her style alongside her signature &quot;sweeping deep-parted bang&quot; hairstyle, which heavily contrasted the loose-fitting, baggy and masculine clothing she sported while promoting &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;. Furthermore, she became the face of Tommy Hilfiger&#x27;s Tommy Jeans advertising campaign upon the release of &quot;One in a Million&quot;, and frequently wore the label&#x27;s clothing items while promoting the album. In an April 1997 article discussing the music video for &quot;One in a Million&quot;, MTV staff felt that Aaliyah was getting &quot;all grown up and steamy in the video&quot;, to which Aaliyah responded by stating: &quot;[As] far as it being sexy, I would prefer to say sensual. Sensual is being in tune with your sensual self. Sexy, I mean that&#x27;s in the eye of the beholder, such as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&quot;

===Release===
In an effort to generate visual awareness for &quot;One in a Million&quot;, Blackground Records ran advertisements on cable channels such as BET and The Box from June 24 to August 6, 1996. The music video for &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot;, the lead single of the album, was serviced to both local and national video shows on July 8. Immediately after the video&#x27;s premiere, the label launched a vigorous print advertisement campaign, featuring Aaliyah in publications such as &quot;Hits&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;The Source&quot;, &quot;Sister 2 Sister&quot;, and &quot;YSB&quot;. Due to Aaliyah&#x27;s outstanding academic performance in high school, Blackground planned to run advertisements in &quot;React&quot;, an educational teen publication inserted in various daily and weekly papers across the US. Since Aaliyah was an advocate for breast cancer screenings and crusades against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Blackground also planned for her to do a series of public service announcements on those topics.

&quot;One in a Million&quot; was first released in France on August 13, 1996, before being released in the US two weeks later, by Blackground and Atlantic Records. In order to support it, Aaliyah embarked on an international promotional tour from August to September, touring the US, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, and Japan. Years after its release and Aaliyah&#x27;s death, the album was reissued across Europe alongside its 2001 eponymous successor, starting February 2004 in Germany and including the bonus track &quot;Come Over&quot;. In August 2021, it was reported that Aaliyah&#x27;s post-Jive recordings would be re-released on physical and digital formats–and be made available on streaming services for the first time–in a deal between Blackground (since rebranded as Blackground Records 2.0) and Empire Distribution. &quot;One in a Million&quot; was reissued on August 20, despite Aaliyah&#x27;s estate issuing a statement in response to Blackground&#x27;s announcement, denouncing the &quot;unscrupulous endeavor to release Aaliyah&#x27;s music without any transparency or full accounting to the estate&quot;. In addition, the album was reissued on vinyl on August 5, 2022.

===Live performances===
On September 14, 1996, Aaliyah made an appearance at MTV&#x27;s sixth annual &quot;Rock N&#x27; Jock&quot; event, which aired on October 26. During the event, she participated in a celebrity basketball game and performed &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot; during the halftime show. On October 11, she performed the song on &quot;Soul Train&quot;. To promote &quot;One in a Million&quot; in the UK, Aaliyah made an appearance on &quot;The O-Zone&quot; on October 24, and on Sky One&#x27;s &quot;The Hit Mix&quot; on November 2, 1996. Aaliyah made an appearance on the Fox television series &quot;New York Undercover&quot;″s as a musical guest, performing &quot;Choosey Lover (Old School/New School)&quot;. She performed &quot;One in a Million&quot; on &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; on February 14, and on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on February 18. Three days later, Aaliyah performed &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot; and &quot;One in a Million&quot; on &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;. In March, Aaliyah made an appearance at the annual &quot;MTV Spring Break&quot; event in Panama City, Florida; during the event, she performed &quot;One in a Million&quot;. Aaliyah had also planned a 1997 tour co-headlined with Az Yet and Foxy Brown.

On July 25, 1997, it was announced that Aaliyah was performing at KUBE 93 FM&#x27;s Summer Jam &#x27;97 concert at The Gorge Amphitheatre in Grant County, Washington. In August, MTV News reported that she was going on a nationwide tour with Dru Hill, Ginuwine, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, and Mary J. Blige; the tour commenced on August 28 in Buffalo, New York, and ended on October 5 in Phoenix, Arizona. Also in August, Aaliyah made a televised appearance on the short-lived talk show &quot;Vibe&quot;, where she performed &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot; and gave the show&#x27;s host a gift basket filled with promotional items. She also performed at KKBT&#x27;s annual Summer Jam concert at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre the same month. In September 1997, Aaliyah performed &quot;One in a Million&quot; on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy show &quot;All That&quot;. She performed &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; on &quot;The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show&quot; on October 6, and at Nickelodeon&#x27;s fourth annual &quot;The Big Help&quot; event in Santa Monica, California on October 19. Aaliyah additionally performed the song on the BET show &quot;Planet Groove&quot; on November 26, 1997. In December, she performed at the UNICEF Gift of Song benefit gala, which aired live on TNT on December 10. Also in December, she performed on the annual &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot; television special.

==Singles==
&quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;One in a Million&quot; on July 15, 1996. It received critical acclaim both upon its release and in retrospective commentaries, mostly directed towards the production and Aaliyah&#x27;s matured vocal performance. A commercial success, the song peaked at number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and atop the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, selling over 600,000 copies in the US by the end of the year. Internationally, it reached the top 20 in New Zealand and the UK. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, and depicts Aaliyah and her entourage arriving to a party on motorcycles, wearing dark leather outfits, and subsequent events at the party. Following the 2021 reissue of &quot;One in a Million&quot;, &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot; debuted and peaked at number 15 on the US Digital Song Sales.

&quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; was released as the second international single from &quot;One in a Million&quot; on November 4, 1996, reaching the top 40 in New Zealand and the UK. Its music video, directed by, Paul Hunter, shows Aaliyah performing the song alongside a hologram of its original performer Gaye. Simultaneously, &quot;One in a Million&quot; was released as the second US single on November 12, 1996. It peaked at number 25 on the US Radio Songs and atop the US R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay. Internationally, the song reached the top 20 in New Zealand and the UK. Its Hunter-directed music video was credited with establishing Aaliyah&#x27;s signature image through a progressively provocative styling, as compared to her previous visuals. Following the 2021 reissue of its parent album, &quot;One in a Million&quot; debuted and peaked at number seven on the US Digital Song Sales, and was certified gold by the RIAA.

&quot;4 Page Letter&quot; was released as the fourth single from &quot;One in a Million&quot; on April 8, 1997, peaking at number 59 on the US Radio Songs and at number 12 on the US R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay. Its music video was directed by Daniel Pearl and follows the song&#x27;s lyrical theme in a forest setting. A reworked, Guy Roche-produced version of &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; was released as the fifth single on August 25, 1997. It peaked at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the highest-peaking single from &quot;One in a Million&quot;, and at number seven on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. The single was certified gold by the RIAA on October 21, and had sold 900,000 copies in the US by the end of 1997. &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot; was released as a double A-side single with &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; on September 16, peaking at number 31 on the US R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay. The Darren Grant-directed music video for the former sees Aaliyah emotionally perform the song in different settings, including a rain shower, which heavily contrasts her energetically performing on a pyrotechnics-infused stage in the Lance Rivera-directed music video for the latter.

==Critical reception==

&quot;One in a Million&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. Writing for AllMusic, Leo Stanley viewed the album as a significant improvement over &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;, noting a larger variety of material and producers, and described Aaliyah&#x27;s vocal performance as &quot;smoother, more seductive, and stronger than before&quot;. Her vocal progression was also met with acclaim from MTV, whose editor noted she &quot;glides easily between vocal ranges&quot;. Peter Miro from &quot;Cash Box&quot; praised Aaliyah for her equal ability in executing different musical styles, listing &quot;A Girl Like You&quot;, &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot;, and the title track as highlights. Connie Johnson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; shared Miro&#x27;s sentiments, commending the range &quot;from the teasingly witchy &#x27;If Your Girl Only Knew&#x27; to the gently poignant &#x27;4 Page Letter&#x27;&quot;, further praising Aaliyah&#x27;s self-assurance and the record&#x27;s diverse production. An editor of &quot;People&quot; also exalted the album&#x27;s sonic heterogeneity and Aaliyah&#x27;s vocal performance, ultimately declaring she managed to live up to the album&#x27;s title. Dream Hampton agreed, writing in her review for &quot;Vibe&quot; that Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;deliciously feline&quot; voice had the same &quot;pop appeal&quot; as Janet Jackson&#x27;s and is complemented by the &quot;solid and supportive&quot; production.

Bob Waliszewski from &quot;Plugged In&quot; gave &quot;One in a Million&quot; a mixed review, as he felt its lyrical messages of loyalty and commitment got overshadowed by sexually suggestive content. J.D. Considine from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; felt the tracks rarely gave Aaliyah a chance to exhibit her vocal strengths, but praised her performance on &quot;Choosey Lover (Old School/New School)&quot;, which she &quot;handles with precisely the sort of suave assurance the song demands.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Q&quot; wrote: &quot;With her smooth, sweetly seductive vocal firmly to the fore, [Aaliyah] works through a set of predominantly slow and steamy swingbeat numbers, all clipped beats, luxurious melodies and dreamy harmonies&quot;. A staff member from &quot;The Source&quot; praised the album for being different than on sophomore album attempts. Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and cited only &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, calling it &quot;a good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money&quot;.

==Accolades==

==Impact and legacy==
Music journalists have credited &quot;One in a Million&quot; for continuously influencing R&amp;B and pop music decades after its release. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called it &quot;undoubtedly one of the most influential R&amp;B albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;. Tom Breihan from &quot;Stereogum&quot; stated that &quot;it helped introduce a whole new herky-jerk electronic take on R&amp;B that marked a near-complete break from everything that had come before&quot;. Briefly discussing the album, Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Timbaland&#x27;s &quot;computer-programmed beats fitted perfectly with her cool, breathy voice to create a new kind of electronic music&quot;.&quot; In 2016, Jordan Simon from &quot;Idolator&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s clear the album&#x27;s deft combination of electronic and R&amp;B set a precedent for the music of this decade, sitting comfortably on a shelf alongside recent releases from Kelela, FKA Twigs and Nao&quot;. Simon also considered &quot;the foresight and risk-taking&quot; on the album as a precursor to the experimentation found on &quot;Aaliyah&quot; (2001). Refinery29&#x27;s Kenneth Partridge said &quot;One in a Million&quot; had &quot;a spacey, sexy vibe that influenced a generation of soul singers and indie rockers alike&quot;. Ross Scarano from &quot;Complex&quot; noted that its influence can be found in modern R&amp;B, hip hop, and electronic dance music. &quot;Slate&quot; writer Dee Lockett stated the album &quot;was unlike anything on the radio at the time, and it inspired a major redirection throughout R&amp;B, helping to bring the genre into the spotlight once again&quot;; she further credited the album for introducing experimental R&amp;B, thus influencing artists such as Drake, Frank Ocean, SZA, and Jhené Aiko.

In retrospective commentaries, critics have emphasized the impact &quot;One in a Million&quot; had on Aaliyah&#x27;s artistry and career. Brandon Caldwell from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that she managed to create a singular identity detached from past controversies and become &quot;the face of a new generation of effortlessly cool performers&quot; with the album. Writing for the music website Albumism, Steven E. Flemming Jr. asserted &quot;One in a Million&quot; cemented Aaliyah&#x27;s status as a viable recording artist alongside peers Brandy and Monica, and called it &quot;a transitional effort that marked a move toward artistic independence and a renewed, worldly purview&quot;.&quot; Flemming, like some other critics, also compared Aaliyah&#x27;s trajectory surrounding &quot;One in a Million&quot; to that of Jackson. The album has also been credited with elevating Elliott and Timbaland&#x27;s respective careers, as they both enjoyed immense commercial success, as well as influencing mainstream music trends, in the years following the release. Cinquemani stated it established &quot;Aaliyah and the Timbo family as undeniable hip-hop forces&quot;.

<text>Payasos en la lavadora (&quot;Clowns in the Washing Machine&quot;) is a humorous novel written in Spanish by the Spanish Basque film maker Álex de la Iglesia in 1997. It tells the experiences of a bohemian writer during Bilbao&#x27;s Main Week fiestas.

==Plot summary==
Álex de la Iglesia signs only two pages of this novel. In this introduction he states he has found a laptop computer lost by the poet Juan Carlos Satrústegui. On it, he has read a file called &quot;Payasos en la lavadora&quot;. Since Satrústegui has entered a mental sanatorium, de la Iglesia talks with the writer&#x27;s mother and decides to publish the text after correcting it. It is a parody of the old literary technique of the false document found by chance, probably influenced by the fact that, in real life, de la Iglesia writes his film scripts on a laptop computer, which he has lost at least twice.

According to this introduction, the rest of the fifteen chapters are Juan Carlos Satrústegui&#x27;s autobiographical tale. Satrústegui considers himself a genius, superior to all those he comes across. But the reader soon realises his psychic problems (obsessions, deliria, paranoia, lack of empathy) become worse due to the drugs he uses in fiestas, the want of slept and the beatings he earns when dealing with the lumpen.

==Allusions/references to other works==
The novel is full of references to popular culture (the very title is about a Spanish TV commercial advertisement for machine soap) and philosophy, with strong contrasts between a literary and grandiloquent language and a rude and crude one, depending on Satrústegui&#x27;s unstable moods.</text><links>

<text>The Hunter Pirates are a defunct Australian professional men&#x27;s basketball team that competed in the National Basketball League (NBL). It was based in the city of Newcastle, New South Wales.

==Team history==
The franchise began as the Canberra Cannons, one of the foundation members of the NBL. At the end of the 2002–03 season, new owners moved the team to Newcastle and renamed the franchise the Hunter Pirates. The Pirates played at the 4,658-seat Newcastle Entertainment Centre.

In its first season, 2003–04, the team came last, winning only two games. Initial coach Bruce Palmer was fired partway into the season and was replaced by assistant coach David Simmons.

In 2004–05, former Perth Wildcats, Australian Boomers and Australian Institute of Sport coach Dr. Adrian Hurley was appointed as the head coach and led the team to eighth place with a 15–17 record. In the playoffs, the Pirates were eliminated by the Brisbane Bullets in the opening round.

In 2005–06, the Pirates made the playoffs where they were beaten by the Cairns Taipans. Following their third season, the Pirates withdrew from the NBL due to financial difficulties and being unable to find a major sponsor.

In March 2006, the Singapore Slingers took over the Pirates&#x27; licence.

<doc id="1127874" wikidata="Q478739" url="?curid=1127874" title="Aaliyah (album)">
<text>Aaliyah is the third and final studio album by American singer Aaliyah. It was released on July 7, 2001, by Blackground Records and Virgin Records. Because of its packaging design, it is also known as &quot;The Red Album&quot;. Aaliyah started to work on the album in 1998, but rescheduled its recording around her developing film career. She resumed recording in 2000 at Sing Sing Studios in Australia, where she shot her role for the 2002 film &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; during the day and recorded songs at night. Additional recording took place at Manhattan Center and Sony Music Studios in New York and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, among other locations. Through her recording contract with Blackground, the singer worked primarily with the record label&#x27;s in-house crew of writers and producers, including Bud&#x27;da, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats, as well as longtime collaborator Timbaland.

&quot;Aaliyah&quot; is described in critical commentaries as an album of R&amp;B, neo soul, and dance-pop, while drawing on an array of other genres such as funk, hip-hop, alternative rock, electronica, and Latin music. The album&#x27;s producers incorporated synthesizer melodies, fragmented beats, distorted guitar, and eccentrically manipulated vocals and song structures, while much of the lyrics were written by singer-songwriter Static Major, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah. The resulting songs deal with the complexities of romantic love and different stages in a relationship. Aaliyah viewed the album as a reflection of herself as both a young adult and a matured vocalist.

&quot;Aaliyah&quot; was critically and commercially well-received upon release, charting at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, it sold diminishingly afterwards. After the album&#x27;s first single &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot; performed moderately, Blackground and Virgin wanted a high-charting follow-up to increase the album&#x27;s sales. The labels chose &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; after it began receiving airplay as an album cut. Aaliyah shot a music video for the song in the Bahamas, but died in a plane crash during a return flight to the US on August 25. After her death, sales of the album greatly increased and led it to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eventually reaching more than 13 million copies sold worldwide. Released during a period of peak activity in R&amp;B, critics have since ranked the album as one of the genre&#x27;s best and most influential records from this era, impacting artists such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, and the Weeknd. After years of internal and legal conflicts between Blackground, the singer&#x27;s estate, and the album&#x27;s creators, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; was released to music streaming services for the first time in 2021.

== Background ==
Aaliyah recorded her second album &quot;One in a Million&quot; with producer-songwriters Timbaland and Missy Elliott, releasing it in 1996 to commercial success, and graduated from high school the following year. She gained achieved further success with songs from film soundtracks, including her 1998 single &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; Recording again with Timbaland for the song, Aaliyah experimented with more avant-garde sounds in her R&amp;B and pop music, while singing in a low-register and minimalist style distinct from her vocally-virtuosic female contemporaries. After it became the biggest success of her career at that point, the singer wanted to keep a lower profile and avoid overexposure.

A third album was planned for February 1999, but Aaliyah postponed its recording to develop an acting career, which led to a starring role in the 2000 film &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;. The film heightened her profile significantly, while the soundtrack&#x27;s single &quot;Try Again&quot; became her first number-one song on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her label Blackground Records used the film and its soundtrack to set up a distribution deal with Virgin Records America, which would distribute Blackground&#x27;s subsequent releases globally.

== Recording and production ==
Aaliyah began recording the album in 1998. She recorded a few songs, including two with Timbaland, before working on &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;. In 1999, while working on the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, but they could not coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;there were nights when I didn&#x27;t go into the studio—I was too tired. On the weekends, I always made it.&quot; Jomo Hankerson, Blackground president and Aaliyah&#x27;s cousin, said that he had to &quot;bribe the producers&quot;, who did not want to &quot;go halfway around the world!&quot; He added that they ultimately had &quot;a beautiful time ... making hot music&quot;.

Most of the album&#x27;s songs were recorded at either Sony Studios in New York City or Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne, including &quot;Loose Rap&quot;, which was done at both studios. Aaliyah recorded &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; at Manhattan Center Studios, &quot;U Got Nerve&quot; at Soundtracks Studios in New York City, &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot; at Westlake Studios, and &quot;I Care 4 U&quot; at Magic Mix Studios and Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles. She had first recorded &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;, written by Elliott, in 1996 for &quot;One in a Million&quot;, but scrapped it after that album&#x27;s completion. Aaliyah worked with Blackground Records&#x27; in-house crew of musicians, songwriters, and producers, including novice producers Bud&#x27;da, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats. Music manager Jimmy Henchman, a friend of Aaliyah&#x27;s manager Barry Hankerson, helped coordinate the record&#x27;s production and arranged for the producers and writers to work with the singer.

Most of the album&#x27;s lyrics were written by Static, from the R&amp;B band Playa. While the band was growing apart, he was invited by Blackground to be a lead writer for the album after writing &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; and &quot;Try Again&quot;. Static was a part of Aaliyah&#x27;s close group of friends, which included Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and shared an infatuation with her. He found Aaliyah to be ideal for his songwriting style, while she believed that he could accurately portray her feelings. A subtly sexual lyricist, he wrote &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; for her in 1999, but Blackground felt she was not ready for the song. Barry Hankerson said of his songwriting, &quot;We always were protective over every lyric ... But he did things where you never felt offended. You just felt like you overheard someone thinking ... he was clever ... Aaliyah depended on him [and] he depended on her.&quot; Elliott said that he was &quot;a part of that bridge of Aaliyah growing up lyrically&quot;. While she discussed the lyrics with Static, the singer consulted Bud&#x27;da about the sound and musical direction of the album. She was interested in learning about the UK garage scene at the time.

In March 2001, Aaliyah finished recording the album after having filmed her part in &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; for four months, which ultimately delayed the album&#x27;s release. &quot;MTV News&quot;″s Gideon Yago reported that she completed its last song on March 9, and the album as a whole was mastered by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles.

While in Australia, Aaliyah also did a photo shoot for the album with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. The singer handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them &quot;dangerous, but quite beautiful&quot; and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot; in April 2001 and told MTV, &quot;They live in solitude, [and] there are times in my life [when] I just want to be by myself. There are times I can&#x27;t even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [but] at the same time, they&#x27;re sexy, too. That&#x27;s why they represent &quot;Aaliyah&quot; pretty well.&quot; Ultimately, Watson&#x27;s photo of Aaliyah posing directly at the camera was chosen by artwork designer Warren Fu to be the front cover, with Watson later explaining that it especially demonstrated &quot;a symmetrical composition ... with a look of confidence and maturity.&quot; Of the album itself, Aaliyah called it &quot;a good reflection of [myself] and the person [I am] today&quot;, saying in an interview for &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, &quot;I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally.&quot;

== Music ==
An R&amp;B, neo soul, and dance-pop album, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; features midtempo funk songs, hip-hop-textured uptempo tracks, and slow jams that draw on older soul influences. Along with contemporary urban sounds, the music incorporates Middle-Eastern influences, muted alternative rock, and—particularly on Timbaland&#x27;s songs for the album—Latin timbres. &quot;Never No More&quot; mixes both older soul and modern hip hop sounds with string arrangements by producer Bud&#x27;da, while &quot;Read Between the Lines&quot; is a rhythmic, digital samba with Latin percussion. &quot;Aaliyah&quot;″s production features synthesizer melodies, vintage syndrums, distorted guitar, staccato arrangements, and layered, eccentrically manipulated vocals. John Mulvey of &quot;NME&quot; finds its sound subtle and lacking &quot;bombast and histrionics&quot;, while the magazine&#x27;s Alex Needham likens its &quot;otherworldly&quot;, high frequency production to dub reggae and the dark, spacious dance music of Dr. Dre and Massive Attack. In Stephen Thomas Erlewine&#x27;s opinion, the album is distinct from the older soul leanings of Macy Gray and Jill Scott, as its music sounds unconventional yet modern, &quot;turning out a pan-cultural array of sounds, styles, and emotions&quot;.

&quot;Aaliyah&quot;″s beats are produced in a manner that makes them sound fragmented, exhibiting techno and electro textures. Tracks such as &quot;Loose Rap&quot;, &quot;Extra Smooth&quot;, and &quot;What If&quot; feature unconventional song structures experimenting with resolution. &quot;I Can Be&quot; and &quot;What If&quot; incorporate 2-step and rock elements, although the latter song draws particularly from Detroit techno and industrial rock. On the club-influenced &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;, Aaliyah&#x27;s vocal harmonies interplay against minor key string and guitar sounds, while &quot;Loose Rap&quot; features underwater noises, low-key electronica in the style of the Neptunes, and harmonically soft vocals declaring &quot;it ain&#x27;t just rhythm and blues&quot;. Ernest Hardy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compares the album&#x27;s experimentation to the sounds on Outkast&#x27;s &quot;Stankonia&quot; (2000), Sade&#x27;s &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; (2000), and Missy Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Miss E... So Addictive&quot; (2001). According to &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani, &quot;like Elliott&#x27;s genre-bending &quot;So Addictive&quot;, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; provides a missing link between hip-hop and electronica.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===
Thematically, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; explore the intricacies of romantic love and phases in a relationship, such as frivolous infatuation, issues near the end of a relationship, and heartache. Subtle, lighthearted humor and witty sound effects, such as comical vocal manipulation, intersperse the themes of heartbreak and eroticism. According to Citysearch&#x27;s Justin Hartung, the record &quot;transforms the confusion of young adulthood into exhilarating freedom&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Rashaun Hall says that each song possess a unique emotional identity that accompanies the music&#x27;s sonic variety. 

Among the female empowerment-themed songs, Bob Waliszewski of &quot;Plugged In&quot; observes a &quot;healthy self-respect&quot; in Aaliyah, who &quot;doesn&#x27;t put up with unfaithful cads (&#x27;U Got Nerve&#x27;), mind games (&#x27;I Refuse&#x27;), self-impressed hunks (&#x27;Extra Smooth&#x27;), gossip and envy (&#x27;Loose Rap&#x27;), or physical abuse (&#x27;Never No More&#x27;)&quot;. The key-shifting, drum and bass-influenced &quot;Extra Smooth&quot; addresses an enthusiastic courtship and is inspired by a conversation between Aaliyah and Static about how men try to act suave, while &quot;Loose Rap&quot; is titled after the slang phrase of the same name and dismisses romantic admirers who use trite pick-up lines. &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; dispassionately dismisses a male lover, while &quot;What If&quot; angrily threatens an unfaithful lover and by extension similar men. On &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;, the narrator tries to console a friend who is heartbroken, but finds herself distressed by unrequited feelings she has for him.

=== Vocals ===

Aaliyah&#x27;s vocals are sung in a restrained soprano style throughout the album. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hyun Kim argues that its songs draw focus to her singing more than her previous records, &quot;bringing it to the forefront as opposed to hiding it behind the layered production&quot;. Biographer Christopher John Farley says that she &quot;emotionally detail[s] a song&quot; unlike on her previous albums and that &quot;her gentle voice now seem[s] like something elemental, a kindly wind blowing through the branches of a big tree.&quot; According to Joshua Clover, Aaliyah pushes musical notes &quot;into strange corners of syncopation&#x27;s shifty architecture&quot; on the more &quot;shape-defying&quot; tracks. Overall, &quot;she makes the sonics tell the story, creating meaning outside the lyrics, pleasure beyond the hooks.&quot;

&quot;Rock the Boat&quot; is sung with breathless vocals by Aaliyah, who instructs her lover on how to please her sexually and equates her erotic high to a drug high. Ballads such as &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;, &quot;Never No More&quot;, and &quot;I Refuse&quot; are sung more emotively, expressing melancholy qualities and hurt. On &quot;I Can Be&quot;, Aaliyah sings from the perspective of an adulterous man&#x27;s mistress who wants to be his foremost girlfriend. Alex Macpherson from &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes that &quot;Aaliyah&#x27;s blank, numbed delivery&quot; on the song &quot;makes being the other woman seem like an emotionally masochistic form of self-medication&quot;.

== Marketing and sales ==


&quot;Aaliyah&quot; was originally issued by Blackground and Virgin in Japan on July 7, 2001, before its release in the United Kingdom on July 16 and in the United States on July 17. In the US, it debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart behind &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; by Alicia Keys, selling 187,000 copies in the week of August 4. Although it was the highest sales week of Aaliyah&#x27;s career, the album sold diminishingly over the next two months. The singer planned to embark on the largest concert tour of her career to support the album, while Blackground and Virgin—heavily invested in the record&#x27;s success—wanted a single with a high chart placement to help increase sales. &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot; had been released as the lead single on April 13, but did not receive significant radio airplay and only reached number fifty-nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Aaliyah and Background were at odds as to what the second single from the album should be. She was pushing for &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; whereas the label was pushing for a Timbaland-produced track. In early August 2001, Aaliyah filmed a music video for the Timbaland-produced &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; in Los Angeles. The label opted for &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; as the album&#x27;s second single after the track began receiving airplay as an album cut, and released the song as a single on August 21, 2001. On August 22, 2001, Aaliyah traveled to the Bahamas to shoot a video for &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;. After its completion, she and several crew members who were returning to the US died in a plane crash on August 25. Blackground executives were uncertain when they would release the album&#x27;s next single and video. &quot;Aaliyah&quot; had sold more than 447,000 copies by this point.

The album&#x27;s sales increased rapidly after Aaliyah died. News of her death was reported on the last day of Nielsen SoundScan&#x27;s sales tracking week, during which &quot;Aaliyah&quot; sold 62,000 copies, a 41.5% increase from its past week&#x27;s sales. The following week, it sold 305,500 copies and ascended from number 19 to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the record&#x27;s highest sales week. It was Aaliyah&#x27;s only album to top any of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s charts and marked the first time a recording artist climbed to number one posthumously since John Lennon in 1980 with his album &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;. On September 19, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; reached more than one million copies sold. In November, &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; was released as a single and reached number two on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart that same month. In the US, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; spent 69 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching 2.06 million copies sold by February 25, 2002, and 2.6 million sold by December 2009.

Blackground, which had ended its joint deal with Virgin in November 2001, wanted to send the video for &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; (released on September 4) to domestic outlets, but it required both labels to work together. Blackground subsequently moved to Universal Records, and the video was first aired in Europe. In the UK, &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; was released as a single on January 7, 2002, and entered the singles chart at number one, while &quot;Aaliyah&quot; re-entered the albums chart at number 65; it had originally entered the chart at number 25 on July 28, 2001. Two weeks after &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; reached number one, the album jumped 17 spots to number five on January 27, 2002. &quot;Aaliyah&quot; went on to spend 36 weeks on the British charts. According to the Official Charts Company, the album sold a total of 303,000 copies in the UK. It also reached number nine on the record charts in France, Germany, and the Netherlands, where it charted for 33, 41, and 46 weeks, respectively. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the record was the 34th best-selling album in the world during 2001. In August 2012, &quot;NME&quot; writer Tom Goodwyn reported that it had sold more than 13 million copies worldwide.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Aaliyah&quot; was met with highly positive reviews from most critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Rawija Kameir, reviewers praised the singer for deviating from the &quot;candy-coated&quot; quality of contemporary pop music in favor of an approach that perfectly balanced pop, R&amp;B, and hip hop. Rashaun Hall from &quot;Billboard&quot; felt that Aaliyah was taking a different approach in comparison to her pop/R&amp;B peers, who &quot;crank out happy-go-lucky albums year after year&quot;. He deemed the album as a &quot;sonically diverse set in which each number has an emotion all its own&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in July 2001, Michael Odell called &quot;Aaliyah&quot; a flawless blend of pop and R&amp;B, &quot;as much a brochure for the current state of R&amp;B production facilities&quot; as it is a showcase for its namesake&#x27;s singing. He found the music&#x27;s textures &quot;scintillating&quot; and believed its distinguishing characteristic to be &quot;a playful and confident reworking of the [R&amp;B] canon&quot;. In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Brad Cawn wrote that Aaliyah demonstrates Sade&#x27;s grace and Missy Elliott&#x27;s daring with fashionable neo soul that is &quot;equal parts attitude and harmony, and all urban music perfection&quot;, while Russell Baillie from &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; deemed the music innovative dance-pop on what he called &quot;a cohesive, detailed and disarmingly enticing album&quot;. Simon Price, writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, wrote the record was &quot;further evidence that black pop is the avant garde&quot;. In a review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin argued that the album establishes Aaliyah as a significant artist unobscured by her collaborators, while Hardy from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a near-flawless declaration of strength and independence&quot; in which Aaliyah explores her &quot;fantasies and strengths&quot;. Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Clover viewed the record as her most profound work and said she had made &quot;art&quot; out of Timbaland and Static&#x27;s &quot;formal finesse&quot; by &quot;investing sound schemes with urgency and emotional intricacy&quot;.

Some reviewers were more qualified in their praise. Mulvey deemed &quot;Aaliyah&quot; &quot;graceful&quot; and &quot;satisfying rather than extraordinary&quot; in his review for &quot;NME&quot;. Although he said it is redeemed by Static&#x27;s consistent songwriting, Timbaland should have contributed more songs, in his opinion. Like Mulvey, &quot;Q&quot; remarked that its music is decent rather than innovative, with some filler. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Craig Seymour wrote that there are a few songs that stray from her musical strengths, but elsewhere she &quot;skillfully portrays love as part woozy thrill, part pulse-racing terror&quot;. Robert Christgau in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; named &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot; and &quot;U Got Nerve&quot; as highlights and called Aaliyah &quot;a slave to her beats, but a proud slave&quot;. Connie Johnson from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was more critical, finding the production unadventurous and the lyrics lacking the depth and &quot;personal revelation that gives music some immediacy&quot;. &quot;E! Online&quot; felt that although the album is &quot;not as immediate as some of her past mainstream work&quot;, she &quot;pushes the boundaries of her voice and her age&quot;. Ultimately the publication praised Aaliyah for &quot;slowly working her way through R&amp;B, hip-hop and even slightly techno beats&quot;. Although Luke McManus from the Irish publication RTÉ felt the album was too long, he praised it saying it was &quot;the smoothest and most seductive R&#x27;n&#x27;B album of the year, with lyrics that are appealingly upfront and assertive&quot;.

&quot;Aaliyah&quot; was named the best album of 2001 by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; and one of the ten best records of the year by &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 39 on their year-end list. The album finished 73rd in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Christgau, who created and supervised the poll, said in his accompanying essay that Aaliyah had finally &quot;developed material nobody can deny&quot; on &quot;a good album&quot;. The record also finished 37th in the annual poll run by German music magazine &quot;Spex&quot;. For the album, Aaliyah was posthumously awarded an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Female Artist. At the 2002 American Music Awards, it won in the category of Favorite R&amp;B/Soul Album. In 2002, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&amp;B Album. &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; was nominated for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; was nominated in the same category in 2003.

== Legacy ==

Along with Aaliyah&#x27;s burgeoning film career, the album was a part of her rising mainstream success in 2001. In a retrospective review, Steve Huey from AllMusic called it her most consummate record and said it &quot;completed the singer&#x27;s image overhaul into a sensual yet sensitive adult&quot;. Erlewine, the website&#x27;s senior editor, regarded the album as &quot;a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward&quot;, while BBC Music&#x27;s Daryl Easlea felt it made Aaliyah&#x27;s two previous accomplished albums &quot;look like exercises in &quot;. According to &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist Quentin B. Huff, she had never used her singing to complement her music&#x27;s innovative production before with as much variety, conviction, and success as on &quot;Aaliyah&quot;, which he said was also known as &quot;The Red Album&quot; because of its red artwork. Huff believed the record showcased the growing rapport between the singer and her collaborators while disproving questions about how she would continue recording music while broadening her profile. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Keith Harris wrote that &quot;Aaliyah had grown from studio puppet to a powerful R&amp;B archetype—a more self-aware Ronnie Spector for a time that requires more self-awareness of its young adults.&quot;

Aaliyah&#x27;s re-emergence with the album in mid-2001 coincided with a period of peak activity in contemporary R&amp;B, as well as the popularity of neo soul. According to Erlewine, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; was &quot;one of the strongest urban soul records of its time&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it the peak of R&amp;B&#x27;s golden age at the &quot;turn of the century&quot;. Alexis Petridis, the newspaper&#x27;s lead critic, believed Aaliyah had recorded her most engaging music in a year when R&amp;B and hip hop demonstrated the most creativity in popular music. In 2005, the &quot;Aaliyah&quot; album ranked 66th on &quot;GQ&quot;″s &quot;100 Coolest Albums in the World&quot;, while &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; placed it at number 47 in the &quot;Top 50 Albums of 2000–2005&quot;; the publication&#x27;s David Drake ranked it eighth on his own list. A few years later, it was named one of &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;150 Essential Albums of the Vibe Era&quot;, and at the end of the decade, it placed at number 72 on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s list of the best albums from the 2000s. Writing for &quot;Vibe&quot;″s list, Jon Caramanica believed &quot;Aaliyah&quot; &quot;may be the best soul album of the young millennium&quot; and yet &quot;redefines the category&quot; with music that is &quot;daring in construction, gorgeous from conception ... damn near post-R&amp;B&quot;. The album was ranked number 77 on NPR&#x27;s &quot;The 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women&quot; list and according to writer Stacia Irons, &quot;&quot;Aaliyah&quot; became a catalyst and bridge that created a smooth transition from &#x27;90s style R&amp;B into Modern PBR&amp;B&quot;.

&quot;Aaliyah&quot; helped establish the &quot;beat&quot;-based sound of R&amp;B during the 2000s while impacting a new wave of black progressive musicians. As &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Micha Frazer-Carroll writes, acts such as Destiny&#x27;s Child, Ashanti, Amerie, and Cassie capitalized on the success of the album&#x27;s &quot;idiosyncratic sound&quot;, while Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;pared-back vocal phrasing&quot; established an archetype for a &quot;more stoic R&amp;B singer&quot; that would influence vocalists like Ciara and Rihanna. Timbaland&#x27;s commercial success with R&amp;B-influenced singers such as Justin Timberlake and Nelly Furtado during the decade was later attributed by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Rebecca Nicholson to his experience producing &quot;Aaliyah&quot;, writing that he &quot;hasn&#x27;t come close to creating anything as sonically stunning since&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; journalist Eve Barlow credited the album in 2011 for &quot;creating a blueprint that can be heard across pop music today&quot; with acts such as R&amp;B singers Beyoncé and The Weeknd, and the indie pop band The xx. According to Kameir, Aaliyah&#x27;s characteristic multi-part harmonies on the album foreshadowed those of Solange Knowles. The Official Charts Company described the album as &quot;one of the most influential R&amp;B albums of modern times&quot;, and that it has &quot;provided inspiration for an entire generation of hip-hop superstars like Beyonce, Frank Ocean and Janelle Monáe&quot;.
The recording sessions for the &quot;Aaliyah&quot; album produced many leftover tracks that were posthumously archived by Blackground and mostly left unreleased because of internal conflicts and legal complications between the label, Aaliyah&#x27;s family, and the producers. Six of these recordings were released in 2002 on the compilation album &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;. Blackground&#x27;s subsequent decline and mismanagement of the singer&#x27;s catalog resulted in the &quot;Aaliyah&quot; album&#x27;s unavailability on streaming services in the next decade, leading Kameir to say in 2019 that, &quot;paradoxically to its significance, the legacy of &quot;Aaliyah&quot; is now diminished&quot;. That year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it number 28 on a list of the 100 best albums from the 21st century, making it the list&#x27;s only album absent from streaming services. The newspaper&#x27;s music editor, Ben Beaumont-Thomas, wrote in an accompanying blurb: &quot;This album is lauded for the three masterpieces Aaliyah made with Timbaland—Try Again, More Than a Woman and We Need a Resolution—that lend a serpentine malevolence to her voice, but there are also strong old-school jams and languorous ballads. Lesser R&amp;B stars match their voice to the beat—Aaliyah&#x27;s genius, tragically cut short when she was killed in a plane crash, was to slink through it with an almost Latin sense of rhythm.&quot;

In August 2021, it was reported that the album and Aaliyah&#x27;s other recorded work for Blackground (since rebranded as Blackground Records 2.0) would be rereleased on physical, digital, and streaming formats in a deal between the record label and Empire Distribution. However, Aaliyah&#x27;s estate issued a statement in response to Blackground 2.0&#x27;s announcement, denouncing the &quot;unscrupulous endeavor to release Aaliyah&#x27;s music without any transparency or full accounting to the estate&quot;. On September 10, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; appeared on streaming and music download services through Blackground and Empire. In the following weeks, it re-entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 13 and at number seven on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and UK Hip Hop and R&amp;B Albums charts.

<text>Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is a form of mass spectrometry that accelerates ions to extraordinarily high kinetic energies before mass analysis. The special strength of AMS among the different methods of mass spectrometry is its ability to separate a rare isotope from an abundant neighboring mass (&quot;abundance sensitivity&quot;, e.g. 14C from 12C). The method suppresses molecular isobars completely and in many cases can also separate atomic isobars (e.g. 14N from 14C). This makes possible the detection of naturally occurring, long-lived radio-isotopes such as 10Be, 36Cl, 26Al and 14C. (Their typical isotopic abundance ranges from 10−12 to 10−18.)

AMS can outperform the competing technique of decay counting for all isotopes where the half-life is long enough. Other advantages of AMS include its short measuring time as well as its ability to detect atoms in extremely small samples.

==Method==
Generally, negative ions are created (atoms are ionized) in an ion source. In fortunate cases, this already allows the suppression of an unwanted isobar, which does not form negative ions (as 14N in the case of 14C measurements). The pre-accelerated ions are usually separated by a first mass spectrometer of sector-field type and enter an electrostatic &quot;tandem accelerator&quot;. This is a large nuclear particle accelerator based on the principle of a tandem van de Graaff accelerator operating at 0.2 to many million volts with two stages operating in tandem to accelerate the particles. At the connecting point between the two stages, the ions change charge from negative to positive by passing through a thin layer of matter (&quot;stripping&quot;, either gas or a thin carbon foil). Molecules will break apart in this stripping stage. The complete suppression of molecular isobars (e.g. 13CH− in the case of 14C measurements) is one reason for the exceptional abundance sensitivity of AMS. Additionally, the impact strips off several of the ion&#x27;s electrons, converting it into a positively charged ion. In the second half of the accelerator, the now positively charged ion is accelerated away from the highly positive centre of the electrostatic accelerator which previously attracted the negative ion. When the ions leave the accelerator they are positively charged and are moving at several percent of the speed of light. In the second stage of mass spectrometer, the fragments from the molecules are separated from the ions of interest. This spectrometer may consist of magnetic or electric sectors, and so-called velocity selectors, which utilizes both electric fields and magnetic fields. After this stage, no background is left, unless a stable (atomic) isobar forming negative ions exists (e.g. 36S if measuring 36Cl), which is not suppressed at all by the setup described so far. Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these can be separated by methods borrowed from nuclear physics, like degrader foils and gas-filled magnets. Individual ions are finally detected by single-ion counting (with silicon surface-barrier detectors, ionization chambers, and/or time-of-flight telescopes). Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these detectors can provide additional identification of background isobars by nuclear-charge determination.

===Generalizations===

The above is just one example. There are other ways in which AMS is achieved; however, they all work based on improving mass selectivity and specificity by creating high kinetic energies before molecule destruction by stripping, followed by single-ion counting.

==History==
L.W. Alvarez and Robert Cornog of the United States first used an accelerator as a mass spectrometer in 1939 when they employed a cyclotron to demonstrate that 3He was stable; from this observation, they immediately and correctly concluded that the other mass-3 isotope, tritium (3H), was radioactive. In 1977, inspired by this early work, Richard A. Muller at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory recognised that modern accelerators could accelerate radioactive particles to an energy where the background interferences could be separated using particle identification techniques. He published the seminal paper in &quot;Science&quot; showing how accelerators (cyclotrons and linear) could be used for detection of tritium, radiocarbon (14C), and several other isotopes of scientific interest including 10Be; he also reported the first successful radioisotope date experimentally obtained using tritium. His paper was the direct inspiration for other groups using cyclotrons (G. Raisbeck and F. Yiou, in France) and tandem linear accelerators (D. Nelson, R. Korteling, W. Stott at McMaster). K. Purser and colleagues also published the successful detection of radiocarbon using their tandem at Rochester. Soon afterwards the Berkeley and French teams reported the successful detection of 10Be, an isotope widely used in geology. Soon the accelerator technique, since it was more sensitive by a factor of about 1,000, virtually supplanted the older &quot;decay counting&quot; methods for these and other radioisotopes. In 1982, AMS labs began processing archaeological samples for radiocarbon dating 

==Applications==

There are many applications for AMS throughout a variety of disciplines. AMS is most often employed to determine the concentration of 14C, e.g. by archaeologists for radiocarbon dating. Compared to other radiocarbon dating methods, AMS requires smaller sample sizes (about 50 mg), while yielding extensive chronologies. MS technology has expanded the scope of radiocarbon dating. Samples ranging from 50,000 years old to 100 years old can be successfully dated using AMS, as other forms of mass spectrometry provide insufficient suppression of molecular isobars to resolve 13CH and 12CH2 from 14C atoms. Because of the long half-life of 14C, decay counting requires significantly larger samples. 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl are used for surface exposure dating in geology. 3H, 14C, 36Cl, and 129I are used as hydrological tracers.

Accelerator mass spectrometry is widely used in biomedical research. In particular, 41Ca has been used to measure bone resorption in postmenopausal women.

<doc id="1127881" wikidata="Q611323" url="?curid=1127881" title="Crazy Rhythms">
<text>Crazy Rhythms is the debut studio album by American rock band the Feelies. It was released in the United Kingdom on February 29, 1980, and in the United States in April 1980, through British record label Stiff. Its fusion of post-punk and jangle pop was influential on the forthcoming alternative rock genre, with R.E.M., among others, citing the album as an influence. Although it was not commercially successful initially, it has remained critically lauded in the decades since its release.

In September 2009 the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series.

== Background ==
On the album, band member Glenn Mercer has said &quot;The sound we were after was a reaction against the punk scene [...] Being a little older, we felt it had all been done before. We wanted the guitars to be cleaner, and we started experimenting with a lot of percussion.&quot;

== Release history ==
The first release on CD was in Germany and the United States in 1986. A&amp;M Records released the album on CD in 1990 with a bonus track, a cover of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Paint It Black&quot;. The track was recorded in 1990 without Fier or DeNunzio.

Bar/None Records reissued &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; on September 8, 2009, while Domino Records reissued the album outside of the U.S. and Canada.

== Critical reception ==
Although not a commercial success, &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; was critically acclaimed on release. Paul Du Noyer of &quot;NME&quot; said that the record was &quot;a very good album. I think it might even be a great one.&quot; He observed that the band &quot;sound like Jonathan Richman trying to sound like the Velvet Underground&quot;, as well as Talking Heads, but that &quot;somehow the way they &quot;are&quot; so derivative is part of the Feelies&#x27; appeal&quot;. Du Noyer described the music as &quot;a kind of cleanly suburban rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll which is simultaneously intense and simplistic&quot; and that the band seemed like &quot;boys next door&quot; but &quot;they&#x27;re nothing of the sort&quot;. In a five-star review in &quot;Sounds&quot;, Pete Silverton observed that for him, the album only worked when he listened to it alone, not with company, and that it blended &quot;the drive of Richman&#x27;s &#x27;Roadrunner&#x27; and some of the tense meanderings of Television&quot;. He summed up the album as &quot;all light and fun over driving but muted city beats – a little jazz here, a little Latin American there and virtually no rock and roll; most every rhythmic play you can hear on New York radio, topped by cool, calm and collected vocals&quot;. David Hepworth, in &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, wrote that the band &quot;have the power to really draw you into their strange little suburban world.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s James Truman was less enthused, stating that the band&#x27;s aim was to achieve a balance of being &quot;intellectual, neurotic cissy&quot; and ironic &quot;Good American&quot;, but that at times &quot;&quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; pushes too hard to get the balance right and falls uneasily between a send-up and a put-on, a masterpiece and an attractive, disposable novelty&quot;. Truman said that the album had &quot;a fussier, more detailed sound than it needed&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Conceptualists will love the Feelies ... I just wish they&#x27;d come on a little less coy and clever.&quot;

In their retrospective review, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; &quot;one of those albums during whose course you hear the most exciting sound in music: things changing.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; branded it &quot;a landmark of jangly, guitar-driven avant-pop, and its shimmering sound can still be heard in bands like R.E.M.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that the album &quot;stands as a wildly inventive and influential record that stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the best music of the American post-punk era. With their very first album, The Feelies managed to speak directly to the zeitgeist of the American independent underground without becoming overexposed or repetitive.&quot; &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot;, released in April 1980 amongst a veritable shitstorm of like-minded groups, stands grinning madly at the top of the pile – a shining monument to new wave at its quirky best.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; was placed at number 17 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll in 1980, beating out such notable critics&#x27; favorites as David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot;, Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Closer&quot;, and The Specials&#x27; debut album.

&quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; was ranked number 49 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s, and number 69 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list.

<text>The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used. It is thus equivalent to the Hamming distance from the all-zero string of the same length. For the most typical case, a string of bits, this is the number of 1&#x27;s in the string, or the digit sum of the binary representation of a given number and the &quot;ℓ&quot;₁ norm of a bit vector. In this binary case, it is also called the population count, popcount, sideways sum, or bit summation.


== History and usage ==
The Hamming weight is named after the American mathematician Richard Hamming, although he did not originate the notion. The Hamming weight of binary numbers was already used in 1899 by James W. L. Glaisher to give a formula for the number of odd binomial coefficients in a single row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. Irving S. Reed introduced a concept, equivalent to Hamming weight in the binary case, in 1954.

Hamming weight is used in several disciplines including information theory, coding theory, and cryptography. Examples of applications of the Hamming weight include:
* In modular exponentiation by squaring, the number of modular multiplications required for an exponent &quot;e&quot; is log2 &quot;e&quot; + weight(&quot;e&quot;). This is the reason that the public key value &quot;e&quot; used in RSA is typically chosen to be a number of low Hamming weight.
* The Hamming weight determines path lengths between nodes in Chord distributed hash tables.
* IrisCode lookups in biometric databases are typically implemented by calculating the Hamming distance to each stored record.
* In computer chess programs using a bitboard representation, the Hamming weight of a bitboard gives the number of pieces of a given type remaining in the game, or the number of squares of the board controlled by one player&#x27;s pieces, and is therefore an important contributing term to the value of a position.
* Hamming weight can be used to efficiently compute find first set using the identity ffs(x) = pop(x ^ (x - 1)). This is useful on platforms such as SPARC that have hardware Hamming weight instructions but no hardware find first set instruction.
* The Hamming weight operation can be interpreted as a conversion from the unary numeral system to binary numbers.
* In implementation of some succinct data structures like bit vectors and wavelet trees.

== Efficient implementation ==
The population count of a bitstring is often needed in cryptography and other applications. The Hamming distance of two words &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; can be calculated as the Hamming weight of &quot;A&quot; xor &quot;B&quot;.

The problem of how to implement it efficiently has been widely studied. A single operation for the calculation, or parallel operations on bit vectors are available on some processors. For processors lacking those features, the best solutions known are based on adding counts in a tree pattern. For example, to count the number of 1 bits in the 16-bit binary number a = 0110 1100 1011 1010, these operations can be done:

Here, the operations are as in C programming language, so means to shift X right by Y bits, X &amp; Y means the bitwise AND of X and Y, and + is ordinary addition. The best algorithms known for this problem are based on the concept illustrated above and are given here:
//types and constants used in the functions below
//uint64_t is an unsigned 64-bit integer variable type (defined in C99 version of C language)
const uint64_t m1 = 0x5555555555555555; //binary: 0101...
const uint64_t m2 = 0x3333333333333333; //binary: 00110011..
const uint64_t m4 = 0x0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f; //binary: 4 zeros, 4 ones ...
const uint64_t m8 = 0x00ff00ff00ff00ff; //binary: 8 zeros, 8 ones ...
const uint64_t m16 = 0x0000ffff0000ffff; //binary: 16 zeros, 16 ones ...
const uint64_t m32 = 0x00000000ffffffff; //binary: 32 zeros, 32 ones
const uint64_t h01 = 0x0101010101010101; //the sum of 256 to the power of 0,1,2,3...

//This is a naive implementation, shown for comparison,
//and to help in understanding the better functions.
//This algorithm uses 24 arithmetic operations (shift, add, and).
int popcount64a(uint64_t x)
 x = (x &amp; m1 ) + ((x » 1) &amp; m1 ); //put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits 
 x = (x &amp; m2 ) + ((x » 2) &amp; m2 ); //put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits 
 x = (x &amp; m4 ) + ((x » 4) &amp; m4 ); //put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
 x = (x &amp; m8 ) + ((x » 8) &amp; m8 ); //put count of each 16 bits into those 16 bits 
 x = (x &amp; m16) + ((x » 16) &amp; m16); //put count of each 32 bits into those 32 bits 
 x = (x &amp; m32) + ((x » 32) &amp; m32); //put count of each 64 bits into those 64 bits 
 return x;

//This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known 
//implementation on machines with slow multiplication.
//This algorithm uses 17 arithmetic operations.
int popcount64b(uint64_t x)
 x -= (x » 1) &amp; m1; //put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
 x = (x &amp; m2) + ((x » 2) &amp; m2); //put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits 
 x = (x + (x » 4)) &amp; m4; //put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
 x += x » 8; //put count of each 16 bits into their lowest 8 bits
 x += x » 16; //put count of each 32 bits into their lowest 8 bits
 x += x » 32; //put count of each 64 bits into their lowest 8 bits
 return x &amp; 0x7f;

//This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known 
//implementation on machines with fast multiplication.
//This algorithm uses 12 arithmetic operations, one of which is a multiply.
int popcount64c(uint64_t x)
 x -= (x » 1) &amp; m1; //put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
 x = (x &amp; m2) + ((x » 2) &amp; m2); //put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits 
 x = (x + (x » 4)) &amp; m4; //put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
 return (x * h01) » 56; //returns left 8 bits of x + (x«8) + (x«16) + (x«24) + ... 


The above implementations have the best worst-case behavior of any known algorithm. However, when a value is expected to have few nonzero bits, it may instead be more efficient to use algorithms that count these bits one at a time. As Wegner described in 1960, the bitwise AND of &quot;x&quot; with &quot;x&quot; − 1 differs from &quot;x&quot; only in zeroing out the least significant nonzero bit: subtracting 1 changes the rightmost string of 0s to 1s, and changes the rightmost 1 to a 0. If &quot;x&quot; originally had &quot;n&quot; bits that were 1, then after only &quot;n&quot; iterations of this operation, &quot;x&quot; will be reduced to zero. The following implementation is based on this principle.
//This is better when most bits in x are 0
//This algorithm works the same for all data sizes.
//This algorithm uses 3 arithmetic operations and 1 comparison/branch per &quot;1&quot; bit in x.
int popcount64d(uint64_t x)
 int count;
 for (count=0; x; count++)
 x &amp;= x - 1;
 return count;


If greater memory usage is allowed, we can calculate the Hamming weight faster than the above methods. With unlimited memory, we could simply create a large lookup table of the Hamming weight of every 64 bit integer. If we can store a lookup table of the hamming function of every 16 bit integer, we can do the following to compute the Hamming weight of every 32 bit integer.

static uint8_t wordbits[65536] = { /* bitcounts of integers 0 through 65535, inclusive */ };
//This algorithm uses 3 arithmetic operations and 2 memory reads.
int popcount32e(uint32_t x)
 return wordbits[x &amp; 0xFFFF] + wordbits[x » 16];

//Optionally, the wordbits[] table could be filled using this function
int popcount32e_init(void)
 uint32_t i;
 uint16_t x;
 int count;
 for (i=0; i &lt;= 0xFFFF; i++)
 x = i;
 for (count=0; x; count++) // borrowed from popcount64d() above
 x &amp;= x - 1;
 wordbits[i] = count;
}
Muła et al. have shown that a vectorized version of popcount64b can run faster than dedicated instructions (e.g., popcnt on x64 processors).

==Minimum weight==
In error-correcting coding, the minimum Hamming weight, commonly referred to as the minimum weight &quot;w&quot;min of a code is the weight of the lowest-weight non-zero code word. The weight &quot;w&quot; of a code word is the number of 1s in the word. For example, the word 11001010 has a weight of 4.

In a linear block code the minimum weight is also the minimum Hamming distance (&quot;d&quot;min) and defines the error correction capability of the code. If &quot;w&quot;min = &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;d&quot;min = &quot;n&quot; and the code will correct up to &quot;d&quot;min/2 errors.

== Language support ==
Some C compilers provide intrinsic functions that provide bit counting facilities. For example, GCC (since version 3.4 in April 2004) includes a builtin function codice_1 that will use a processor instruction if available or an efficient library implementation otherwise. LLVM-GCC has included this function since version 1.5 in June 2005.

In the C++ Standard Library, the bit-array data structure codice_2 has a codice_3 method that counts the number of bits that are set. In C++20, a new header codice_4 was added, containing functions codice_5 and codice_6, taking arguments of unsigned integer types.

In Java, the growable bit-array data structure has a method that counts the number of bits that are set. In addition, there are and functions to count bits in primitive 32-bit and 64-bit integers, respectively. Also, the arbitrary-precision integer class also has a method that counts bits.

In Python, the codice_7 type has a codice_8 method to count the number of bits set. This functionality was introduced in Python 3.10, released in October 2021.

In Common Lisp, the function codice_9, given a non-negative integer, returns the number of 1 bits. (For negative integers it returns the number of 0 bits in 2&#x27;s complement notation.) In either case the integer can be a BIGNUM.

Starting in GHC 7.4, the Haskell base package has a codice_10 function available on all types that are instances of the codice_11 class (available from the codice_12 module).

MySQL version of SQL language provides codice_13 as a standard function.

Fortran 2008 has the standard, intrinsic, elemental function codice_14 returning the number of nonzero bits within an integer (or integer array).

Some programmable scientific pocket calculators feature special commands to calculate the number of set bits, e.g. codice_15 on the HP-16C and WP 43S, codice_16 or codice_17 on HP-16C emulators, and codice_18 on the WP 34S.

FreePascal implements popcnt since version 3.0.

== Processor support ==
* The IBM STRETCH computer in the 1960s calculated the number of set bits as well as the number of leading zeros as a by-product of all logical operations.
* Cray supercomputers early on featured a population count machine instruction, rumoured to have been specifically requested by the U.S. government National Security Agency for cryptanalysis applications.
* Control Data Corporation&#x27;s (CDC) 6000 and Cyber 70/170 series machines included a population count instruction; in COMPASS, this instruction was coded as codice_19.
* The 64-bit SPARC version 9 architecture defines a codice_20 instruction, but most implementations do not implement it, requiring it be emulated by the operating system.
* Donald Knuth&#x27;s model computer MMIX that is going to replace MIX in his book The Art of Computer Programming has an codice_21 instruction since 1999. codice_22 counts all bits that are 1 in b and 0 in c and writes the result to a.
* Compaq&#x27;s Alpha 21264A, released in 1999, was the first Alpha series CPU design that had the count extension (codice_23).
* Analog Devices&#x27; Blackfin processors feature the codice_24 instruction to perform a 32-bit population count.
* AMD&#x27;s Barcelona architecture introduced the advanced bit manipulation (ABM) ISA introducing the codice_25 instruction as part of the SSE4a extensions in 2007.
* Intel Core processors introduced a codice_25 instruction with the SSE4.2 instruction set extension, first available in a Nehalem-based Core i7 processor, released in November 2008.
* The ARM architecture introduced the codice_27 instruction as part of the Advanced SIMD (NEON) extensions.
* The RISC-V architecture introduced the codice_28 instruction as part of the Bit Manipulation (B) extension.

<text>A priest hole is a hiding place for a priest built in England or Wales during the period when Catholics were persecuted by law. Following the accession of Queen Elizabeth I to the throne in 1558, there were several Catholic plots designed to remove her, and severe measures, including torture and execution, were taken against Catholic priests. From the mid-1570s, hides were built into houses to conceal priests from priest hunters. Most of the hides that survive today are in country manor houses, but there is much documentary evidence, for example in the &quot;Autobiography&quot; and &quot;Narrative of the Gunpowder Plot&quot; of John Gerard, of hides in towns and cities, especially in London.

The two best-known hide builders are Jesuit lay brother Nicholas Owen, who worked in the South and the Midlands, and Jesuit priest Richard Holtby, who worked in the North. After the Gunpowder Plot, Owen was captured, taken to the Tower of London, and tortured to death on the rack. He was canonised as a martyr by Pope Paul VI in 1970. Holtby was never arrested, and he died peacefully in 1640.

==Background==
The legal restrictions on Catholic worship, promulgated shortly after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, became much harsher as a result of Catholic resistance against her, including the Rising of the North (1569), the Papal Bull Regnans In Excelsis (1570), which excommunicated Elizabeth and released Catholics from their allegiance to her, the return of the first seminary priests in the 1570s, the arrival of the Jesuits from 1580 onwards, and the Throckmorton Plot (1583). A range of increasingly draconian measures culminated in the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, which made being or sheltering a Catholic priest in England or Wales high treason, punishable by hanging, drawing and quartering.

&quot;Priest hunters&quot; had already been tasked with collecting information and locating any priests, and executions of seminary priests, starting with Cuthbert Mayne in 1577, were becoming routine. Hides had already been built before then: the first reference to one is in 1574 at a search of the Vavasours&#x27; house in York, and Edmund Campion was captured in one at Lyford Grange in 1581, but they did not become widespread until well into the 1580s, and there are reports of priests hiding in barns, haystacks and hollow trees. The 1584 Act changed everything, making it too dangerous for a priest to stay in any one place for more than a day or two, as their arrest would make their hosts liable to execution. In response to this, and following a conference and prayer meeting of the Jesuits and other seminaries held at Harleyford in July 1586 (at which the music was directed by William Byrd), a new strategy was adopted under which each priest would be stationed long-term in a single country house and such houses would be systematically equipped with hides. Previously, few if any, actual hides existed, and the priests had been largely itinerant, but this involved staying at inns, and many were arrested while travelling. Simultaneously, an &#x27;underground railroad&#x27; was set up to smuggle priests into the country and move them to holding centres (called &#x27;receptacles&#x27;) until a long term posting became available.

==Location and use==

An English country house &quot;was more than simply a family home. It combined some of the functions of a museum, a local government office, a farm and a hotel.&quot; &quot;If it was a recusant house, it was also a church, a presbytery and something of a thieves&#x27; Alsatia.&quot; The conflict between the public nature of some of these functions and the need for security, meant that priest holes and recusant chapels are almost always found on the upper floors of houses, well away from the majority of the easily-bribed estate workers and affording an extra few minutes to reach a hide when search parties arrived. Houses with thick stone walls offered many options for excavating hides, but in brick or timber-framed houses, hides are usually located in or around chimneystacks or staircases. Hides large enough to hold a person were known as &#x27;conveyances&#x27;, but there are also many examples of small hidden spaces to accommodate vestments, sacred vessels, and altar furniture, which were known as &#x27;secret corners&#x27;. The need for the hides to be close at hand was dramatically demonstrated on Maundy Thursday (17 April) 1606 when the Lord Mayor of London led a search of John Gerard&#x27;s house in London. The searchers found the congregation and the smoke of the extinguished candles, but the priest, Thomas Everard (Jesuit) made it safely into one of the three hides in the house and was not found.
The novelists&#x27; favourite entrance - a secret door in the panelling - is rather rare, but there is one example at Ripley Castle in North Yorkshire. Most were accessed from a trapdoor. A common early pattern of hide is a space under the floor of a garderobe for example at Harvington Hall in Worcestershire, which has seven priest holes throughout the house, including access through the main staircase, panelling, and a false fireplace. Such hides are on the outside walls of buildings and betray themselves as large areas of windowless brickwork, a fact that became known to the searchers. Later and more sophisticated hides tended to be deep within the buildings. Underground hides are extremely rare, although Owen converted a sewer at Baddesley Clinton and there were attested examples at Grosmont Priory and Sledwich.

===Nicholas Owen===

Many such hiding places are attributed to a Jesuit lay brother, Nicholas Owen (died 1606), who devoted the greater part of his life to constructing these places to protect the lives of persecuted priests. John Gerard (Jesuit), who knew Owen for almost 20 years and whose life was saved at least three times by Owen&#x27;s hides said this about him:
After the Gunpowder Plot, Owen was captured at Hindlip Hall, Worcestershire, taken to the Tower of London and tortured to death on the rack. He was canonised as a martyr by Pope Paul VI in 1970.

==Effectiveness==
The effectiveness of priest holes was demonstrated by their success in baffling the exhaustive searches of the &quot;pursuivants&quot; (priest-hunters), described in contemporary accounts of the searches. Search-parties would bring with them skilled carpenters and masons and try every possible expedient, from systematic measurements and soundings to the physical tearing down of panelling and pulling up of floors. Another ploy would be for the searchers to pretend to leave and see if the priest would then emerge from hiding. He might be half-starved, cramped, sore with prolonged confinement, and almost afraid to breathe lest the least sound should throw suspicion upon the particular spot where he was concealed.

Searches had mixed success: Edmund Campion was found in a hide during a search in 1581 because the searchers saw light shining through between two planks. Gerard survived a four day search in 1594 in an identifiable Owen hide (which still exists) and a nine day search in 1605 at Harrowden (which does not) and a somewhat perfunctory search which was almost certainly at Baddesley Clinton although none of the three eyewitness accounts of the search mention the name of the house. Henry Garnet and Edward Oldcorne were found in an Owen hide at Hindlip Hall on the eighth day of a search following the Gunpowder Plot. Nicholas Owen himself and Ralph Ashley were also arrested during the same search, having been forced by lack of food to attempt to escape from their hide after four days. Edward Oldcorne had previously survived a three day search at Hindlip in 1598. By and large the hides seem to have done their job: there are very few records of cases of searchers actually finding an occupied hide without help from an informant.

Partly due to the existence of these priest holes, the execution tally fell from 100 during the 1580s to around 60 in the 1590s, 30 in the 1600s, 10 in the 1610s and 3 in the 1620s, whilst the number of priests at work rose from 130 in 1586 to 400 in 1610.

<text>Bufotenin, also known as dimethylserotonin or as 5-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (5-HO-DMT), is a serotonergic psychedelic of the tryptamine family. It is a derivative of the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT). The compound is an alkaloid found in some species of mushrooms, plants, and toads. It is also found naturally in the human body in small amounts. Bufotenin, for instance derived from the trees &quot;Anadenanthera colubrina&quot; and &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot;, appears to have a long history of entheogenic use in South America.

The name bufotenin originates from the toad genus &quot;Bufo&quot;, which includes several species of psychoactive toads, most notably &quot;Incilius alvarius&quot; (formerly &quot;Bufo alvarius&quot;), that secrete bufotoxins from their parotoid glands. However, &quot;Bufo&quot; species like &quot;Incilius alvarius&quot; contain only trace amounts of bufotenin, with their major active component instead being 5-MeO-DMT. In addition to DMT and serotonin, bufotenin is similar in chemical structure to other psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DMT and psilocin (4-HO-DMT). These compounds also occur in some of the same fungus, plant, and animal species as bufotenin.

Bufotenin acts as a potent and non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors, among others. It also acts as a potent and specific serotonin releasing agent. The compound is more hydrophilic than other related tryptamines and consequently is more peripherally selective. In relation to this, bufotenin has been associated with prominent peripheral serotonergic side effects, such as cardiovascular changes.

For many decades and even into the present, bufotenin has been considered by many experts, such as David E. Nichols, to be either inactive or only weakly active as a psychedelic in humans and to produce robust toxic effects. Alexander Shulgin was also uncertain whether bufotenin was an active psychedelic. However, Jonathan Ott found in 2001 via self-experimentation that bufotenin is in fact a potent psychedelic and does not necessarily produce serious adverse effects. Hamilton Morris has further supported these findings with his own self-experimentation, although bufotenin was reported to be strongly nauseating for himself and many others. According to Morris, the psychedelic effects of bufotenin are like a cross between those of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. Morris has stated that bufotenin may in fact be the psychedelic with the longest history of human entheogenic use. Bufotenin has also been encountered as a recreational drug in forensic samples, for instance in New York City.

==Nomenclature==
Bufotenin (bufotenine) is also known by the names 5-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (5-HO-DMT), &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, dimethylserotonin, and mappine, among others.

==History==
Bufotenin was isolated from toad skin, and named by the Austrian chemist Handovsky at the University of Prague during World War I. The structure of bufotenine was confirmed in 1934 by Heinrich Wieland&#x27;s laboratory in Munich, and the first reported synthesis of bufotenine was by Toshio Hoshino and Kenya Shimodaira in 1935.

==Sources==
===Toads===
Bufotenin is found in the skin and eggs of several species of toads belonging to the genus &quot;Bufo&quot;, but is most concentrated in the Colorado River toad (formerly &quot;Bufo alvarius&quot;, now &quot;Incilius alvarius&quot;), the only toad species with enough bufotenin for a psychoactive effect. Extracts of toad toxin, containing bufotenin and other bioactive compounds, have been used in some traditional medicines such as &quot;ch&#x27;an su&quot; (probably derived from &quot;Bufo gargarizans&quot;), which has been used medicinally for centuries in China.

The toad was &quot;recurrently depicted in Mesoamerican art&quot;, which some authors have interpreted as indicating that the effects of ingesting &quot;Bufo&quot; secretions have been known in Mesoamerica for many years; however, others doubt that this art provides sufficient &quot;ethnohistorical evidence&quot; to support the claim.

In addition to bufotenin, &quot;Bufo&quot; secretions also contain digoxin-like cardiac glycosides, and ingestion of these toxins can be fatal. Ingestion of &quot;Bufo&quot; toad poison and eggs by humans has resulted in several reported cases of poisoning, some of which resulted in death. A court case in Spain, involving a physician who dosed people with smoked Mexican Toad poison, one of his customers died after inhaling three doses, instead of the usual of only one, had images of intoxicated with this smoke suffering obvious hypocalcemic hand muscular spasms.

Reports in the mid-1990s indicated that bufotenin-containing toad secretions had appeared as a street drug, supposedly but in fact &quot;not&quot; an aphrodisiac, ingested orally in the form of &quot;ch&#x27;an su&quot;, or as a psychedelic, by smoking or orally ingesting &quot;Bufo&quot; toad secretions or dried &quot;Bufo&quot; skins. The use of &quot;chan&#x27;su&quot; and &quot;love stone&quot; (a related toad skin preparation used as an aphrodisiac in the West Indies) has resulted in several cases of poisoning and at least one death. The practice of orally ingesting toad poison has been referred to in popular culture and in the scientific literature as toad licking and has drawn media attention. Albert Most, founder of the defunct Church of the Toad of Light and a proponent of spiritual use of &quot;Bufo alvarius&quot; toxin, published a booklet in 1983 titled &quot;Bufo alvarius: The Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert&quot; which explained how to extract and smoke the secretions.

Bufotenin is also present in the skin secretion of three arboreal hylid frogs of the genus &quot;Osteocephalus&quot; (&quot;Osteocephalus taurinus&quot;, &quot;Osteocephalus oophagus&quot;, and &quot;Osteocephalus langsdorfii&quot;) from the Amazon and Atlantic rain forests.

===&quot;Anadenanthera&quot; seeds===
Bufotenin is a constituent of the seeds of &quot;Anadenanthera colubrina&quot; and &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot; trees. Anadenanthera seeds have been used as an ingredient in psychedelic snuff preparations by indigenous cultures of the Caribbean, Central and South America since pre-Columbian times. The oldest archaeological evidence of use of &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; beans is over 4,000 years old.

===Other sources===
Bufotenin has been identified as a component in the latex of the takini (&quot;Brosimum acutifolium&quot;) tree, which is used as a psychedelic by South American shamans, and in the seeds of &quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot;. Bufotenin has also been identified in &quot;Amanita muscaria,&quot; &quot;Amanita citrina&quot;, &quot;A. porphyria&quot;, and &quot;A. tomentella&quot;.

===Humans===
Bufotenin occurs in trace amounts in the human body. It can be biosynthesized from serotonin by indolethylamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (INMT) enzymes.

====Association with schizophrenia and other mental disorders====
A study conducted in the late 1960s reported the detection of bufotenin in the urine of schizophrenic subjects; however, subsequent research failed to confirm these findings until 2010.

Studies have detected endogenous bufotenin in urine specimens from individuals with other psychiatric disorders, such as infant autistic patients. Another study indicated that paranoid violent offenders or those who committed violent behaviour towards family members have higher bufotenin levels in their urine than other violent offenders.

A 2010 study utilized a mass spectrometry approach to detect levels of bufotenin in the urine of individuals with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and asymptomatic subjects. Their results indicate significantly higher levels of bufotenin in the urine of the ASD and schizophrenic groups when compared to asymptomatic individuals.

==Effects==
===Fabing &amp; Hawkins (1955)===
In 1955, Fabing and Hawkins administered bufotenin intravenously at doses of up to 16mg to prison inmates at Ohio State Penitentiary. A toxic effect causing purpling of the face was seen in these tests.

A subject given 1mg reported &quot;a tight feeling in the chest&quot; and prickling &quot;as if he had been jabbed by needles.&quot; This was accompanied by a &quot;fleeting sensation of pain in both thighs and a mild nausea.&quot;

Another subject given 2mg reported &quot;tightness in his throat.&quot; He had tightness in the stomach, tingling in pretibial areas, and developed a purplish hue in the face indicating blood circulation problems. He vomited after 3 minutes.

Another subject given 4mg complained of &quot;chest oppression&quot; and that &quot;a load is pressing down from above and my body feels heavy.&quot; The subject also reported &quot;numbness of the entire body&quot; and &quot;a pleasant Martini feeling-my body is taking charge of my mind.&quot; The subject reported he saw red spots passing before his eyes and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face. Within 2 minutes these visual effects were gone, and replaced by a yellow haze, as if he were looking through a lens filter.

Fabing and Hawkins commented that bufotenin&#x27;s psychedelic effects were &quot;reminiscent of [LSD] and mescaline but develop and disappear more quickly, indicating rapid central action and rapid degradation of the drug&quot;.

===Isbell (1956)===
In 1956, Harris Isbell at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, experimented with bufotenin as a snuff. He reported &quot;no subjective or objective effects were observed after spraying with as much as 40 mg bufotenine&quot;; however, subjects who received 10–12mg by intramuscular injection reported &quot;elements of visual hallucinations consisting of a play of colors, lights, and patterns.&quot;

===Turner &amp; Merlis (1959)===
Turner and Merlis (1959) experimented with intravenous administration of bufotenin (as the water-soluble creatinine sulfate salt) to schizophrenics at a New York state hospital. They reported that when one subject received 10mg during a 50-second interval, &quot;the peripheral nervous system effects were extreme: at 17 seconds, flushing of the face, at 22 seconds, maximal inhalation, followed by maximal hyperventilation for about 2 minutes, during which the patient was unresponsive to stimuli; her face was plum-colored.&quot; Finally, Turner and Merlis reported:

After pushing doses to the morally admissible limit without producing visuals, Turner and Merlis conservatively concluded: &quot;We must reject bufotenine . . . as capable of producing the acute phase of Cohoba intoxication.&quot;

===McLeod and Sitaram (1985)===
A 1985 study by McLeod and Sitaram in humans reported that bufotenin administered intranasally at a dose of 1–16mg had no effect, other than intense local irritation. When given intravenously at low doses (2–4mg), bufotenin oxalate caused anxiety but no other effects; however, a dose of 8mg resulted in profound emotional and perceptual changes, involving extreme anxiety, a sense of imminent death, and visual disturbance associated with color reversal and distortion, and intense flushing of the cheeks and forehead.

===Ott (2001)===
In 2001, ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott published the results of a study in which he self-administered free base bufotenin via insufflation (5–100mg), sublingually (50mg), rectally (30mg), orally (100mg) and via vaporization (2–8mg). Ott reported &quot;visionary effects&quot; of intranasal bufotenin and that the &quot;visionary threshold dose&quot; by this route was 40mg, with smaller doses eliciting perceptibly psychoactive effects. He reported that &quot;intranasal bufotenine is throughout quite physically relaxing; in no case was there facial rubescence, nor any discomfort nor disesteeming side effects&quot;.

At 100mg, effects began within 5minutes, peaked at 35 to 40minutes, and lasted up to 90minutes. Higher doses produced effects that were described as psychedelic, such as &quot;swirling, colored patterns typical of tryptamines, tending toward the arabesque&quot;. Free base bufotenin taken sublingually was found to be identical to intranasal use. The potency, duration, and psychedelic action was the same. Ott found vaporized free base bufotenin active from 2 to 8mg with 8mg producing &quot;ring-like, swirling, colored patterns with eyes closed&quot;. He noted that the visual effects of insufflated bufotenin were verified by one colleague, and those of vaporized bufotenin by several volunteers.

Ott concluded that free base bufotenin taken intranasally and sublingually produced effects similar to those of Yopo without the toxic peripheral symptoms, such as facial flushing, observed in other studies in which the drug was administered intravenously.

===Morris (2020s)===
Hamilton Morris, a psychoactive drug journalist, the creator of &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s Pharmacopeia&quot;, and a pharmacologist, has experimented with bufotenin and found that it was an active psychedelic. He has claimed that its effects are like a cross between those of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, being less visual than DMT but more visual than 5-MeO-DMT. Morris has also stated that bufotenin is very nauseating and this has made it unpleasant for himself and other people. By insufflation, he has said that its duration is about 1hour and is longer than that of DMT or 5-MeO-DMT.

Morris and others have suggested use of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (Zofran) to prevent nausea and vomiting with especially nauseating or serotonin 5-HT3 receptor agonistic serotonergic psychedelics like bufotenin.

===Lethal dose===
The acute toxicity () of bufotenin in rodents has been estimated at 200 to 300mg/kg. Death occurs by respiratory arrest. In April 2017, a South Korean man died after consuming bufotenin-containing toads that had been mistaken for edible Asian bullfrogs, while in Dec. 2019, five Taiwanese men became ill and one man died after eating bufotenin-containing Central Formosa toads that they mistook for frogs.

==Side effects==
Side effects of bufotenin include nausea and vomiting, among others.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Bufotenin is an analogue of the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin. Similarly to serotonin and related compounds like dimethyltryptamine (DMT), bufotenin is an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, and 5-HT4 receptors. It is also known to bind with high affinity to other serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. Bufotenin has about 5- to 10-fold higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor than 5-MeO-DMT, about the same activational potency as 5-MeO-DMT at the receptor &quot;in vitro&quot; ( = 3.49nM and 3.87nM, respectively), and about 3-fold higher &quot;in-vivo&quot; potency than 5-MeO-DMT when they are in the brain. In contrast to many other psychedelic tryptamines, bufotenin shows high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT3 receptors, similar to or higher than that of serotonin, and this receptor is strongly associated with production of nausea and vomiting. In addition to its serotonin receptor agonism, bufotenin is a potent serotonin releasing agent (SRA) with an value of 30.5nM, whereas it is inactive as a releaser of dopamine or norepinephrine ( &gt; 10,000nM).

Bufotenin is thought to have reduced capacity to cross the blood–brain barrier due to its relatively high hydrophilicity and hence to show significant peripheral selectivity. As a result, bufotenin has a greater ratio of peripheral activity to central effect. Bufotenin produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. However, it requires doses about 10-fold higher than those of psilocybin to produce behavioral responses in rats. Studies have been mixed on the psychedelic effects of bufotenin in humans, with some finding a relative lack of psychedelic effects and pronounced toxic effects, while others have found psychedelic effects without major adverse effects. In any case, bufotenin has often been reported to produce pronounced peripheral serotonergic effects. These have included cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and other effects, among them increased respiratory rate, chest heaviness, purpling of the head and neck skin (intense skin flushing), nausea, vomiting, and retching. It is possible that in addition to its limited central permeation, the peripheral effects of bufotenin have served to mask its central and hallucinogenic effects. The adverse effects of bufotenin may be more pronounced with intravenous injection compared to other routes such as insufflation.

In contrast to peripheral administration, intracerebroventricular injection of bufotenin in animals readily produces robust psychedelic-like behavioral effects similar to those of other serotonergic psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. In addition, 5-MeO-DMT, the &quot;O&quot;-methylated analogue of bufotenin, which has greater lipophilicity, is readily able to cross the blood–brain barrier and produce psychedelic effects. Bufotenin prodrug esters, with greater lipophilicity than bufotenin itself, like &quot;O&quot;-acetylbufotenin and &quot;O&quot;-pivalylbufotenin, have also shown robust psychedelic-like effects in animals.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Bufotenin has been reported to undergo a strong first-pass effect and to not be orally active. This is in contrast to its positional isomer psilocin, which is thought to form a pseudo-ring system that limits its susceptibility to metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO). However, bufotenin actually does show oral activity if sufficiently high doses are taken. About 10-fold higher doses of bufotenin seem to be required orally compared to parenterally for effects.

In rats, subcutaneously administered bufotenin (1–100μg/kg) distributes mainly to the lungs, heart, and blood, and to a much lesser extent, the brain (hypothalamus, brain stem, striatum, and cerebral cortex), and liver. It reaches peak concentrations at one hour and is nearly eliminated within 8hours. In humans, intravenous administration of bufotenin results in excretion of (70%) of injected drug in the form of 5-HIAA, an endogenous metabolite of serotonin, while roughly 4% is eliminated unmetabolized in the urine. Orally administered bufotenin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase.

Psilocin (4-HO-DMT) is a positional isomer of bufotenin and might be expected to have similarly limited lipophilicity and blood–brain permeability. However, psilocin appears to form a tricyclic pseudo-ring system wherein its hydroxyl group and amine interact through hydrogen bonding. This in turn results in psilocin being much less polar, more lipophilic, and more able to cross the blood–brain barrier and exert central actions than it would be otherwise. In contrast, bufotenin is not able to achieve this pseudo-ring system. Accordingly, bufotenin is less lipophilic than psilocin in terms of partition coefficient. In any case, bufotenin does still appear to show significant central permeability and, like psilocybin, can produce robust hallucinogenic effects in humans.

==Chemistry==
Bufotenin, also known as 5-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (5-HO-DMT), is a substituted tryptamine and a derivative of dimethyltryptamine (DMT; &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT). It is also closely related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT) and 5-MeO-DMT.

The predicted log P of bufotenin ranges from 0.89 to 2.04. For comparison, the predicted log P of DMT is 2.06 to 2.5, of serotonin is 0.2 to 0.56, of 5-MeO-DMT is 1.5 to 2.38. and of psilocin is -0.14 to 2.1.

===Analogues and derivatives===
Some analogues and derivatives of bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), aside from serotonin and DMT, include psilocin (4-HO-DMT) (a positional isomer), 5-MeO-DMT (&quot;O&quot;-methylbufotenin), &quot;O&quot;-acetylbufotenine, &quot;O&quot;-pivalylbufotenine, bufotenidine (&quot;N&quot;-methylbufotenin), 5-HO-DiPT, and α-methylserotonin, among others.

==Society and culture==
===Recreational use===
Bufotenin has been encountered as a recreational drug in forensic samples, for instance in New York City.

===Legal status===
====Australia====
Bufotenin is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance according to the Criminal Code Regulations of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is also listed as a Schedule 9 substance under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A schedule 9 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as &quot;Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO.&quot;

Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 is determined to be enough for court of trial and is considered intent to sell and supply.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, bufotenin is a Class A drug under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act.

====United States====
Bufotenin (DEA Drug Code 7403) is regulated as a Schedule I drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration at the federal level in the United States and is therefore illegal to buy, possess, and sell.

====Sweden====
Sweden&#x27;s public health agency suggested classifying Bufotenin as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.

<text>Freeman Wills Crofts FRSA (1 June 1879 – 11 April 1957) was an Irish engineer and mystery author, remembered best for the character of Inspector Joseph French.

A railway engineer by training, Crofts introduced railway themes into many of his stories, which were notable for their intricate planning. Although Raymond Chandler, Agatha Christie, and authors of the so-called golden age of detective fiction are more famous, he was esteemed by those authors, and many of his books are still in print.

==Birth and education==
Crofts was born at 26 Waterloo Road, Dublin, Ireland. His father, also named Freeman Wills Crofts, was a surgeon-lieutenant in the Army Medical Service but he died of fever in Honduras before the young Freeman Wills Crofts was born. In 1883, Crofts&#x27; mother, née Celia Frances Wise, married the Venerable Jonathan Harding, Vicar of Gilford, County Down, later Archdeacon of Dromore, and Crofts was raised in the vicarage at Gilford. He attended Methodist College and Campbell College in Belfast. In 1912 he married Mary Bellas Canning, daughter of the manager of the Coleraine branch of the Provincial Bank.

==Engineering career==
In 1896, at the age of seventeen, Crofts was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Berkeley Deane Wise, who was chief engineer of the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway. In 1899 Crofts was appointed Junior Assistant on the construction of the Londonderry and Strabane Extension of the Donegal Railway. In 1900, he became District Engineer at Coleraine for the L.M.S. Northern Counties Committee at a salary of £100pa, living at 11 Lodge Road in the town. In 1922, Crofts was promoted to Chief Assistant Engineer of the railway, based in Belfast. He lived at &#x27;Grianon&#x27; in Jordanstown, a quiet village some six miles north of Belfast, where it was convenient for Crofts to travel by train each day to the railway&#x27;s offices at York Road. One of the projects he worked on was the design of the &#x27;Bleach Green Viaduct&#x27; in Whiteabbey, close to his Jordanstown home. This was a significant 10 arch reinforced concrete viaduct approved in 1927 and completed in 1934. It carried a new loop line which eliminated the need for trains between Belfast and the north west to reverse at Greenisland. Croft continued his engineering career until 1929. In his last task as an engineer, he was commissioned by the Government of Northern Ireland to chair an inquiry into the Bann and Lough Neagh Drainage Scheme.

==Writing career==
In 1919, during an absence from work due to a long illness, Crofts wrote his first novel, &quot;The Cask&quot; (1920), which established him as a new master of detective fiction. Crofts continued to write steadily, producing a book almost every year for thirty years, in addition to a number of short stories and plays.

He is remembered best for his fictional detective, Inspector Joseph French, who was introduced in his fifth book, &quot;Inspector French&#x27;s Greatest Case&quot; (1924). Inspector French always solved each of the mysteries presented him in a workmanlike, precise manner – this method set him apart from most other fictional sleuths.

In 1929, Crofts abandoned his railway engineering career and became a full-time writer. He settled in the village of Blackheath, near Guildford, in Surrey, and a number of his books are set in the Guildford area, including &quot;The Hog&#x27;s Back Mystery&quot; (1933) and &quot;Crime at Guildford&quot; (1935). Many of his stories have a railway theme, and his particular interest in the apparently unfalsifiable alibi often emphasized the intricacies of railway timetables. Near the end of his life, he and his wife relocated to Worthing, Sussex in 1953, where they lived until his death in 1957, the year in which his last book was published.

Crofts also wrote one religious book, &quot;The Four Gospels in One Story&quot;, several short stories, and short plays for the BBC.

==Marriage, affiliations and other interests==
In 1912 he wed Mary Bellas Canning, the daughter of John J. C. Canning of Coleraine, Ireland, bank manager. They had no children.

He was a member, with Dorothy L. Sayers and Agatha Christie, of the Detection Club which met in Gerrard Street.

In 1939 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

Crofts was not only a railway engineer and writer, but also an accomplished musician. He was organist and choirmaster in Killowen Parish Church, Coleraine, St Patrick&#x27;s Church, Jordanstown and the parish church of St Martin&#x27;s in Blackheath.

==Reputation==
Crofts was esteemed, not only by his regular readers, but also by his fellow writers of the so-called Golden Age of Detective Fiction. Agatha Christie included parodies of Inspector French alongside Sherlock Holmes and her own Hercule Poirot in &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; (1929).

Raymond Chandler described him as &quot;the soundest builder of them all when he doesn’t get too fancy&quot; (in &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot;). His attention to detail and his concentration on the mechanics of detection makes him the forerunner of the &quot;police procedural&quot; school of crime fiction.

However, it has also given rise to a suggestion of a certain lack of flair – Julian Symons describing him as of &quot;the humdrum school&quot;. This may explain why his name has not remained as familiar as other more imaginative Golden Age writers, although he had 15 books included in the Penguin Books &quot;green&quot; series of the best detective novels and 36 of his books were in print in paperback in 2000.

Based in Newcastle, New South Wales, the team played in the NBL&#x27;s inaugural season in 1979 but left the league in the late 1990s after new owners based in Albury couldn&#x27;t resolve the club&#x27;s ongoing financial problems.

==History==
The Falcons hold a special place in the history of the NBL with the club largely responsible for the formation of the league which also saw them organise the first season in 1979. The other clubs had to pay a fee of around AU$300 to the Falcons to participate in that first season and the city of Newcastle is regarded as the birthplace of the NBL.

The club&#x27;s original colours were green and white, being the city&#x27;s colours, but the club soon changed to black and red, and to red and blue, after the Newcastle Knights&#x27; admission to the New South Wales Rugby League in 1988. All the national league clubs in Newcastle took on red and blue as their colours at some stage in their existence.

The club&#x27;s downfall began in the mid-1990s when problems with sponsor, clothing and sports equipment company Topper befell them and the National Soccer League&#x27;s Newcastle Breakers. Even with the support of new sponsor EnergyAustralia and new owners, the club couldn&#x27;t get itself out of trouble, and left the league following the 1998–99 NBL season.

==Home Arenas==

After spending its first 13 seasons playing out of the 2,200 capacity Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium, the Falcons made the move to the new, 4,658 seat Newcastle Entertainment Centre located on the other side of the Newcastle Showgrounds in 1992 where they would remain until the club folded in 1999. Although the Falcons never appeared in an NBL Grand Final, the Broadmeadow Stadium hosted the 1982 NBL Grand Final between the West Adelaide Bearcats and the Geelong Supercats. West Adelaide won the Grand Final 80–74 in front of a capacity crowd.

==Post 1999==
The city of Newcastle had no NBL team until the new owners of the Canberra Cannons moved to Newcastle and established the Hunter Pirates in 2003. The Pirates in turn withdrew from the NBL at the end of the 2005–2006 season after their licence was sold to the Singapore Slingers.

In 2011, past Falcons players reunited for a charity exhibition game at the Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium to raise funds for the Cancer Council. Nathan Tinkler&#x27;s Hunter Sports Group attempted to revive the Falcons NBL team around this time but was ultimately unsuccessful in doing so.

The Falcons name was revived in 2021 when the Newcastle Hunters Waratah League basketball team announced that they would be changing their name to the Newcastle Falcons upon their admission to the NBL1 East competition in 2022.

<text>Jasim bin Jabir (), also known as Raqraqi, was a 19th-century pirate active in the Persian Gulf.

Bin Jabir had his base at Khor Al Adaid and attacked British ships in the Persian Gulf, with caravans carrying the booty inland. Khalifa bin Shabkhout, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, having received permission from the resident British authorities, attacked Khor Al Adaid in May 1836, killing 50 men and destroying its houses and fort. In the aftermath of the attack, bin Jabir took refuge in Doha in September 1836. The chief of Doha was warned not to harbor bin Jabir, but he refused to heed the warning. In the aftermath of bin Jabir&#x27;s seizure of a British vessel off of Ras al-Khaimah in February 1841, the city of Doha was bombarded by British forces as punishment for continuing to provide him with a safehaven.

<doc id="1127900" wikidata="Q529393" url="?curid=1127900" title="Miyoko Watai">
<text>is a retired Japanese chess player and widow of former world chess champion Bobby Fischer.

==Biography==
She was awarded the title of Woman International Master by FIDE in 1997. Watai is a four-time Japanese women&#x27;s champion. She lives in Kamata ward, which is now part of Ōta Ward, Tokyo.

In 1973, she met then world chess champion Bobby Fischer, and visited him several times for the next three decades. Starting in 2000 they reportedly lived together in a &quot;de facto&quot; marriage at her home. After Bobby Fischer&#x27;s detention on July 13, 2004, for trying to travel with a revoked U.S. passport, she campaigned for his release. 

They were reportedly married in August 2004. According to an attorney representing a competing claim to Fischer&#x27;s estate, the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled in December 2009 that Watai&#x27;s claim of marriage to Fischer was invalidated because of her failure to present the original of their alleged marriage certificate. However, on March 3, 2011, a district court in Iceland ruled that Miyoko Watai, as Fischer&#x27;s widow and heir, was entitled to inherit his estate. It also ruled that Watai and Fischer had legally married on September 6, 2004.

<text>Consulates were operating in Australian cities long before the Commonwealth of Australia was founded in 1901. The United States opened a consulate in Sydney in 1836, with other countries later following including Switzerland (1855), Germany (1879) and Japan (1896, in Townsville).

The diplomatic corps was first established in Canberra in 1936 when the United Kingdom appointed its first High Commissioner to Australia. Canada appointed a representative in 1939 and the United States of America established a legation in 1940. This was followed in early 1941 by Japan only for the legation to be closed in December 1941 with the entry of Japan into World War II. The period 1941-1945 saw additional legations opened by wartime allies China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, France and the Netherlands and the appointment of High Commissioners by New Zealand and India. In 1946, Australia and the United States upgraded their diplomatic relations to ambassadorial level and exchanged ambassadors in September of that year. This was followed for the other legations of permanent members of the UN Security Council, France, China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1948 and by the late 1960s all existing legations in Canberra had been upgraded to embassies.

Initially residences and chanceries were in the Canberra suburbs of Red Hill and Forrest. The majority of missions are today in the lakeside suburb of Yarralumla or the suburb of O&#x27;Malley in the Woden Valley. Many countries have built their chanceries in distinctive architectural styles reflecting national traditions or aspirations.

Some countries have chosen not to establish an embassy in Canberra but instead operate a consulate in a major city, such as Melbourne and Sydney.

As of 2024, Canberra hosts 112 embassies/high commissions.

<doc id="1127906" wikidata="Q7017412" url="?curid=1127906" title="Newcastle Entertainment Centre">
<text>Newcastle Entertainment Centre is a multi-purpose Australian arena within the Newcastle Showground. It was opened in 1992.

The venue has a seating capacity of 7,528. The centre is air-conditioned (installed as a requirement of the NBL when it moved to playing in the summer), equipped with top-grade lights, and also has scoreboards used for basketball and netball games. The venue is owned by Venues NSW and operated by ASM Global.

==Tenants==
The centre&#x27;s original tenant was the Newcastle Falcons NBL team who moved to the new venue in 1992 from their previous home at the Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium. After the Falcons folded at the end of the 1999 season its only tenant was the Hunter Jaegers netball team who played in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. The Jaegers played in the centre from 1997 until 2008. From 2003 the NEC served as the home court for another NBL team, the Hunter Pirates (formerly the Canberra Cannons before the team was moved to Singapore to become the Singapore Slingers after the 2005-06 NBL season).

The Newcastle Show uses the centre for various displays and the showbag area. The stadium has also played host to some of Kostya Tszyu&#x27;s early fights as an Australian-based fighter.

== Modes ==
The Newcastle Entertainment Centre was built as a multi-purpose facility to host concerts, sporting events, exhibitions and functions.

=== Concert ===
The centre has the following capacities in its different concert modes:
* General Admission mode - up to 7,528 patrons
* End Stage mode - up to 6,193 patrons seated
* Reduced mode - variable between 2,500 and 7,528 patrons

Curtaining allows the adapting of the venues to suit more intimate modes for performers.

The centre has played host to concerts by many nationally and internationally renowned performers including John Denver, Tina Arena, Tones and I, Cher, Celine Dion, Jason Derulo, John Farnham, Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue, Rhianna, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Pet Shop Boys, P!nk, Powderfinger, Cliff Richard, Silverchair, Taylor Swift, Lorde, Queens Of The Stone Age, Beastie Boys, Gang Of Youths, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, The Smashing Pumpkins and The Wiggles.

=== Sports ===
The centre has hosted numerous basketball, netball, boxing, bull riding, ice staking and tennis events. In sports mode, the centre can accommodate between 2,000 and 5,000 patrons.

=== Exhibition ===
The seating in the venue is fully retractable providing 4,100 square metres of clear span exhibition space.

=== Function ===
The centre is able to host functions catering up to 2,000 guests.

<text>Unstable Ape Records was an Australian independent record label. Founded in Tasmania, it functioned out of Melbourne between 2001 and 2013. Unstable Ape&#x27;s focus tended primarily towards indie rock and roll, but also expanded its interest to contemporary folk (Laura Jean, Marissa Nadler), jazz (Christopher Hale Ensemble) and world music (Zulya). In the early 2000s, the label became a home to many Melbourne indie rock bands. Albums are now all out of print although some are available to stream.
The label ceased trading in early 2013, its last release being Tales of Subliming by Zulya and the Children of the Underground.

<text>A sympagic environment is one where water exists mostly as a solid, ice, such as a polar ice cap or glacier. Solid sea ice is permeated with channels filled with salty brine. These briny channels and the sea ice itself have its ecology, referred to as &quot;sympagic ecology&quot;.

Residents of temperate or tropical climates often assume, mistakenly, that ice and snow are devoid of life. In fact, a number of varieties of algae such as diatoms engage in photosynthesis in arctic and alpine regions of Earth. Other energy sources include Aeolian dust and pollen swept in from other regions. These ecosystems also include bacteria and fungi, as well as animals like flatworms and crustaceans. A number of sympagic worm species are commonly called ice worms. 

Additionally, the ocean has abundant plankton, and prolific algal blooms occur in the polar regions each summer as well as in high mountain lakes, bringing nutrients to those parts of the ice in contact with the water. In the Arctic Ocean, ice algae accounts for close to half of the primary production during the summer months.

In the spring, krill can scrape off the green lawn of ice algae from the underside of the &quot;pack ice.&quot;

<doc id="1127927" wikidata="Q728697" url="?curid=1127927" title="Laicism">
<text>Laicism refers to the policies and principles where the state plays a more active role in excluding religious visibility from the public domain. The term &quot;laïcité&quot; was coined in 1871 by French educator and later Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ferdinand Buisson, who advocated a religion-free school curriculum.

==History==

The term &quot;laicism&quot; arose in France in the 19th century for an anticlerical stance that opposed any ecclesiastical influence on matters of the French state, but not Christianity itself. In 1894, the Dreyfus affair began in France. Domestic political upheavals, latent antisemitism and attempts by clerical-restorationist circles to exert influence led to years of social polarization in the country. In foreign policy, diplomatic relations between France and the Vatican were broken off in 1904. They were not resumed until 1921. Domestically, the 1905 law on the separation of church and state came into effect, which the then deputy and later prime minister Aristide Briand in particular had worked to have passed. This was the first concrete application of the principle created by Buisson. The term &quot;laïcité&quot; was first used in the 1946 constitution. Its Article 1 reads: &quot;La France est une République indivisible, laïque, démocratique et sociale&quot;.

<text>NOLA is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Down, released on September 19, 1995, by EastWest Records. The title is the abbreviation for New Orleans (NO), Louisiana (LA).

==Production==
===Writing and recording===
&quot;NOLA&quot; was written mainly by Phil Anselmo and Pepper Keenan between 1990 and 1995. Throughout 1991 to 1993, the band released three demos, a three-track demo (1991), a four-track demo (1992), and a ten-track demo (1993). Originally, the band made the three-track demo for underground trading. The demo featured the tracks &quot;Losing All&quot;, &quot;Temptation&#x27;s Wings&quot;, and &quot;Bury Me in Smoke&quot;. In an effort to build a fan base, the band would ask heavy metal fans if they had ever &quot;heard of this band, Down&quot; and hand them copies of the tape without telling the person that they were in the band. In 1992, the band recorded a second demo, this time featuring the same track listing as the original but with an intro. In 1993, the band made the &quot;Demo Collection 1992–1993&quot; which is a ten-track demo featuring all the songs that would make the album cut except &quot;Rehab&quot;, &quot;Pray for the Locust&quot;, and &quot;Underneath Everything&quot;. Anselmo solely wrote only three songs on the album (&quot;Hail the Leaf&quot;, &quot;Pray for the Locust&quot;, and &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot;). Eventually, the original demo tape was distributed throughout the United States and Down played a small concert in its home town. A record executive from EastWest Records was attending the show. When he found out who the members of the band were, he signed Down to a recording contract. The band began recording the album in the summer of 1994 at the Ultrasonic Studios, New Orleans, Louisiana, and completed the recording sessions by January 1995.

===Influences===
The band cites as influences 70s heavy rock bands such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, Southern rock bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd (in the song &quot;Stone the Crow&quot;) and ZZ Top (in the rhythmic style of &quot;Rehab&quot;) and Doom metal bands such as Witchfinder General, Pentagram, Trouble, Saint Vitus (especially album V) and The Obsessed.

===Artwork===
The booklet art is by Jim DeBarros and David Manteau and makes extensive use of vintage photographs by Clarence John Laughlin.

==Release and reception==
===Commercial performance===
&quot;NOLA&quot; was released in September 1995 and would peak at number 57 in October 1995 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and remain on the chart for six weeks. The album spawned four singles in &quot;Stone the Crow&quot;, &quot;Lifer&quot;, &quot;Temptation&#x27;s Wings&quot;, which were released in 1995, and &quot;Bury Me in Smoke&quot; in 1996. However, only &quot;Stone the Crow&quot; would achieve commercial success when it reached number 40 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, becoming Down&#x27;s first and only top 40 song.

===Critical reception===

The album received acclaim from critics. AllMusic reviewer David Reamer praised the songs &quot;Temptation&#x27;s Wings&quot;, &quot;Stone the Crow&quot;, and &quot;Bury Me in Smoke&quot;, stating that &quot;this is a landmark album that combines the talents of dedicated rock musicians, and should be included in any collection of heavy metal music.&quot; In 2006, Oliver Badin of &quot;Terrorizer&quot; wrote that Down &quot;succeeded where most supergroups fail: truly being the perfect sum of [its members] parts. But what makes [&quot;NOLA&quot;] so great is its forcible seizure of the Sabbathian legacy and how it soaked it in the filthy swamps of New Orleans.&quot;

&quot;Rock Hard&quot; ranked the album at number 244 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Tour==
Down supported &quot;NOLA&quot; with a 13-date concert tour. The band went on hiatus in 1996 as all members continued their main projects. They would reunite in 1999 to make a second album, &quot;Down II&quot;, released in 2002.
