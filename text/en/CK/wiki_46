<text>Xiangsheng (), also known as crosstalk or comic dialog, is a traditional performing art in Chinese comedy, and one of the most popular elements in Chinese culture. It is typically performed as a dialog between two performers, or rarely as a monologue by a solo performer (similar to most forms of stand-up comedy), or even less frequently, as a group act by multiple performers. The Xiangsheng language, rich in puns and allusions, is delivered in a rapid, bantering style, typically in the Tianjin dialect (or in Mandarin Chinese with a strong northern accent). The acts would sometimes include singing, Chinese rapping, and musical instruments.

Xiangsheng has connections with the vaudeville Double act that developed in approximately the same era. Some Westerners have studied the art of Xiangsheng. One Canadian student of Xiangsheng, Mark Rowswell, who uses the stage name of Dashan, has said that the closest English equivalent is &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;, a sketch by Abbott and Costello. However, many acts in vaudeville and radio double acts, as well as the screen comedy dialog that evolved from them, are similar to Xiangsheng in their formula.

== Format ==
Modern Xiangsheng comprises four classic skills:

* &quot;Speaking&quot; (simplified Chinese: 说; traditional Chinese: 說; pinyin: &quot;shuō&quot;): to tell a story, which is the pragmatic mechanism of humor (i.e. making jokes or using tongue-twisters).
* &quot;Imitating&quot; (simplified Chinese: 学; traditional Chinese: 學; pinyin: &quot;xué&quot;): includes Kouji, accents, dialects, and other sounds, as well as imitating the &quot;singing&quot; and actions of specific characters in traditional Chinese operas such as Peking opera, Pingxi, and Bangzi.
* &quot;Teasing&quot; (Chinese: 逗; pinyin: &quot;dòu&quot;): to make a joke—tease is the soul of Xiangsheng.
* &quot;Singing&quot; (Chinese: 唱; pinyin: &quot;chàng&quot;): only Taiping lyrics can be considered as singing in Xiangsheng.
Xiangsheng is most commonly performed by two actors. The leading actor is called Dougen (simplified Chinese: 逗哏; traditional Chinese: 逗哏; pinyin: dòugén) and the supporting actor is called Penggen (simplified Chinese: 捧哏; traditional Chinese: 捧哏; pinyin: pěnggén).

==History==

=== Origins ===
Xiangsheng is generally thought to have originated in the late Qing Dynasty, particularly during the rules of the Xianfeng Emperor and the Tongzhi Emperor in the mid-1800s, although its roots may extend as far back as the Ming Dynasty. It began as a form of street performance, incorporating joke-telling, comedic banter, imitations, or borrowing from other performance arts, such as Peking opera, all with the express purpose of making audiences laugh. By the early days of the Republic of China, Xiangsheng had evolved into a more modern format. It was performed in teahouses, theaters, and, eventually, on radio and television.

There are three major sources of Xiangsheng: Beijing Tianqiao, Tianjin Quanyechang, and the Nanjing Confucius Temple. The origins of certain modern-day Xiangsheng pieces can be traced back well over 100 years, though in many cases, the original author is unattributed. Many skits in &quot;traditional Xiangsheng&quot; have evolved through generations of performers successively revising material, retaining the general structure or &quot;heart&quot; of a piece while updating specific references with more modern material.

One of the earliest Xiangsheng pioneers is a person known by the name of Zhang Sanlu (), who performed during the mid-19th century. Originally a performer of Ba Jiao Gu (&quot;drum-song&quot;) (), Zhang eventually switched to doing imitations and telling humorous stories. Later artists considered Zhang to have been one of the first Xiangsheng performers.

=== Xiangsheng in Chinese Mainland ===
After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the popularity of Xiangsheng increased. Previously seen as relatively low-class street performing, Xiangsheng became regarded as a proletarian art form. Because it was performed in Mandarin Chinese, Xiangsheng became a useful tool for promoting the use of Mandarin Chinese throughout China.

In the 1950s, Hou Baolin led a group of Xiangsheng performers to reform Xiangsheng, removing language and content that was considered &quot;vulgar&quot; and generally making it more &quot;politically correct&quot;. Hou later became widely regarded as a master of Xiangsheng. He is often regarded as &quot;China&#x27;s Charlie Chaplin&quot;.

As with many forms of performance art, Xiangsheng was banned during the Cultural Revolution. It experienced a huge resurgence in the mid-1970s, with many skits satirizing the Gang of Four and excesses of this period. With the popularization of television in the 1980s, Xiangsheng became a standard feature of the annual New Year&#x27;s Gala of China Central Television (CCTV), as well as other popular performing arts shows in China.

Xiangsheng entered a period of decline in the 1990s, caused largely by increased official sensitivity towards political and social satire following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, as well as the lack of performance venues outside of sanitized state-run television programming. Many performers called for a return of performing Xiangsheng in teahouses and small theaters, which had traditionally been the main venues for Xiangsheng performances but were almost never used at the time. A new generation of Xiangsheng performers emerged from this movement, including Guo Degang. Guo has been credited with renewing interest among young millennial audiences, who found Xiangsheng to be boring and didactic. Guo&#x27;s rise to fame, while representing a very traditionalist movement, pitted him against more mainstream, establishment performers, such as Jiang Kun.

In recent years, to appeal to younger audiences, animators have created animated versions of various skits using audio from past broadcasts. The animated versions often use humor in a literal sense, illustrating scenes or stories described by the performers. There are some variety shows for young Xiangsheng actors to promote themselves like &quot;Xiangsheng Has New Talents&quot; (Chinese: 相声有新人) and &quot;Happy Comedian&quot; (Chinese: 欢乐喜剧人), both hosted by Guo Degang.

=== Xiangsheng in Taiwan ===
In 1949, a group of Xiangsheng performers followed the Republic of China&#x27;s retreat to Taiwan. The same year, Chen Yian (Chinese: 陳逸安), Wei Longhao (Chinese: 魏龍豪), and Wu Zhaonan met and hosted a Xiangsheng show on the Broadcasting Corporation of China and Taiwan Police Radio (Chinese: 警察廣播電台). After 1967, he began collecting data to produce &quot;Xiangsheng Collections&quot;, &quot;Xiangsheng Highlight&quot;, &quot;Xiangsheng Anecdote&quot;, and &quot;Rediscovery of Xiangsheng&quot;.

Initially, Xiangsheng&#x27;s main audience was internal immigrants, mainly from military dependents&#x27; villages. In 1985, the performance workshop Biao Fang (Chinese: 表演工作坊) launched &quot;That Night, We Speak Xiangsheng&quot; (Chinese: 那一夜，我們說相聲), a play performed by Li Liqun (Chinese: 李立群) and Li Guoxiu (Chinese: 李國修), which caused a stir.

In 1989, Biao Fang launched the stage play &quot;Tonight, Who Speaks Xiangsheng?&quot; (Chinese: 這一夜，誰來說相聲), which was performed by Li Liqun (Chinese: 李立群), Jin Shijie (Chinese: 金士傑), and Chen Lihua (Chinese: 陳立華). Numerous other plays were produced, including:

* &quot;Taiwan Bizarre Talk&quot; (1991; performed by Li Liqun),
* &quot;That Night, We Speak Xiangsheng&quot; (Chinese: 那一夜，我們說相聲; 1993; performed by Li Liqun and Feng Yugang (Chinese: 馮翊綱)),
* &quot;Another Night, They Speak Xiangsheng&quot; (1997; performed by Feng Yugang, Zhao Ziqiang (Chinese: 赵自强), and Bu Xueliang (Chinese: 卜學亮), and
* &quot;Millennium Night, We Speak Xiangsheng&quot; (2000; performed by Zhao Ziqiang, Jin Shijie, and Ni Minjan).

In 2005, &quot;This Night, Women Speak Xiangsheng&quot;—performed by Fang Fang (Chinese: 方芳), Deng Chenghui (Chinese: 鄧程慧), and Xiao Ai (Chinese: 蕭艾)—was launched. Although all these plays were claimed to be Xiangsheng, they were actually theater performances.

In April 1988, Feng Yugang and Song Shaoqing (Chinese: 宋少卿) formed Comedians Workshop, which aimed to merge theater with Xiangsheng. Huang Shiwei (Chinese: 黄士伟) joined in 2001. On July 8, 2004, Comedians Workshop assisted Dream Theater to perform &quot;Give Me a Tape.&quot;

In 1993, Liu Zengqi (Chinese: 劉增鍇) and Lin Wenbin (Chinese: 林文彬) founded the Taipei Musical Art Troupe. In addition to Xiangsheng, they also introduced many Chinese traditional Quyi (a traditional form of Chinese art), such as Shuanghuang (Chinese: 双簧), Pingshu (Chinese: 评书), Shulaibao (Chinese: 数来宝), Kuaiban (Chinese: 快板书), Jingyun drum (Chinese: 京韵大鼓), Meihua drum (Chinese: 梅花大鼓), Xihe drum (Chinese: 西河大鼓), Danxian (Chinese: 单弦), and Taiping lyrics (Chinese: 太平歌詞), which have also promoted the exchange of performances between Taiwan and Mainland China.

On August 26, 1999, Wu Zhaonan announced the establishment of Wu Zhaonan&#x27;s Xiangsheng Club. Only direct disciples of Wu Zhaonan could become official members. In addition to Xiangsheng, it also introduced Quyi, including Shuanghuang (Chinese: 双簧), Pingshu (Chinese: 评书), Shulaibao (Chinese: 数来宝), Kuaiban (Chinese: 快板书), Danxian (Chinese: 单弦), Taiping lyrics (Chinese: 太平歌詞), and Peking opera.

=== Xiangsheng in Hong Kong ===
Northern Xiangsheng has been popular in Hong Kong since the Zhongyuan period. As early as the Qing Dynasty, storytellers from China brought Xiangsheng to South Guangdong and Hong Kong.

After Hong Kong was ceded as a British colony, the development of Xiangsheng entered a unique period of localization. In the early years of the Republic of China, Hong Kong&#x27;s Xiangsheng mainly performed in the street, and most Xiangsheng artists were jugglers, such as Pingshu and Kouji. Xiangsheng performers came from all walks of life. They were knowledgeable and enjoyed chatting, thus using Xiangsheng to make a living.

In the 1940s and 50s, Hong Kong cinema began to develop rapidly, and Xiangsheng began to integrate into emerging media. In old Hong Kong movies, Xiangsheng-inspired comedy began to integrate into early Hong Kong cinema, mostly in the form of monologs and characters teasing each other.

In 1957, the first Chinese-language TV media in the world was created; it was called Rediffusion Television Limited and was the predecessor of Asia Television. Xiangsheng became a fixed performance for variety shows. In 1967, Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) was created, and the variety show &quot;Enjoy Yourself Tonight&quot; was launched. Xiangsheng began to appear in several variants in the variety show, such as the host&#x27;s speech and the show to show lines. 

=== Xiangsheng in Malaysia (Overseas Chinese) ===
After the Chinese Civil War, a number of performers from South China traveled to Malaysia for development (before Singapore&#x27;s expulsion from Malaysia). Feng Xiang (Chinese: 冯翔), Bai Yan, and Lu Ding performed Xiangsheng in this region. In the multi-language environment of Malaysia, &quot;Malaysian Xiangsheng&quot; became different from Xiangsheng in mainland China and Taiwan. Since Mandarin Chinese is not a mainstream language in Malaysia, there are few professional performers in Malaysia.

=== Xiangsheng in North America ===
In 1984, 19-year-old Canadian comedian Mark Rowswell started learning Chinese at the University of Toronto. After graduating in 1988, he went on to study Xiangsheng at Peking University with a Chinese comedian and Xiangsheng master, Jiang Kun (姜昆). He started using the Chinese name &#x27;Dashan&#x27; (大山), now a household name in China. Dashan has consistently improved his Chinese over thirty years, frequently appearing on national Chinese television. His career has consisted of a wide variety work, not just Xiangsheng, and in recent years he has gravitated more towards Western-style stand-up comedy in Chinese, with elements of Xiangsheng incorporated into the act. Dashan has served informally as a cultural ambassador, using his work to help bridge cultural gaps between Canada and China.

In 2012, American comedian Jesse Appell, known as Ai Jiexi (艾杰西) in China, started on his journey with Xiangsheng. Originally from Boston, Massachusetts, Appell went to Brandeis University where he joined the Global China Connection (GCC) and regularly performed stand-up comedy. He went to China in September 2012 to study Chinese at Tsinghua University as a Fulbright Scholar. There, he improved his Chinese and was awarded the Critical Language Enhancement Award (CLEA). As part of his Fulbright Scholarship, he studied Xiangsheng with a master of the craft, Ding Guangquan (丁广泉). Appell founded a comedy center, LaughBeijing, that hosted over 300 shows per year in Beijing from 2016 to 2020. Some of his work today also focuses on bringing the Western-style stand-up comedy to China. He sees himself as a cultural ambassador, combining his talents with the power of the Internet to help U.S.-China relations and bridge cultural gaps.

=== As social commentary ===
The small scale and popularity of Xiangsheng make it second only to word of mouth in reflecting popular concerns. Hou Baolin and others have said that Xiangsheng items are &quot;works of comic nature which use satire and humor as their principal base. The cross talks use witty speech, bitter, ridiculous ridicule, in order to achieve the purpose of arrogant &quot;big laugh&quot; and entertaining people. Its earliest form was derived from the juggling of &quot;Yuyou&quot;. In these jokes, artists often pinned their mockery and whipping against the rulers. Their satirical content strikes home at contemporary malpractices and also often includes political satire.&quot; The role of Xiangsheng in the social commentary was seen after the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976 when Xiangsheng performances provided the first open criticisms of the gang. After 1976, Xiangsheng has also satirized corrupt officials and members of the Chinese Communist Party, although criticism of the party as an entity remains off-limits.

<text>TRESS 90 (1990–1996) was a Norwegian software project meant to be the replacement for INFOTRYGD, a case-worker support system, used by the Norwegian National Insurance Service.

Due to administrative, political, organizational and technical problems, including extreme cost overruns, the project was eventually abandoned with a total pricetag of ($200m).

It is still the largest IT failure in Norwegian history.

<text>(Italian for &quot;little song&quot;) is a musical term, originally meaning a short song of simple character, without a second strain or any repetition of the air. It is now frequently applied to any simple, melodious air, as distinguished from brilliant arias or recitatives, many of which are part of a larger movement or scena in oratorio or opera.

&quot;Ecco, ridente in cielo&quot; from Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, &quot;Porgi amor&quot; and &quot;Se vuol ballare&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; are well-known &quot;cavatinas.&quot; A famous piece that bears the name, although without words, is the 5th movement of Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet in B-flat major, Opus 130. Ralph Vaughan Williams also gave the title of &quot;Cavatina&quot; to the 3rd movement of his Symphony No. 8. Camille Saint-Saëns wrote a Cavatine for trombone and piano.

In opera, the term has been described as:
a musical form appearing in operas and occasionally in cantatas and instrumental music...In opera the cavatina is an aria, generally of brilliant character, sung in one or two sections without repeats. It developed in the mid-18th century, coincident with the decline of the previously favoured &quot;da capo&quot; aria (in which the musical form is ABA, with the repeated A section given improvised variations). Examples occur in the operas of Mozart, Weber, and Rossini. In 19th-century bel canto operas of Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi the term came to refer to a principal singer’s opening aria, whether in one movement or paired with a contrasting cabaletta.

==Derivation==

In Italian, the word is the &quot;diminutive&quot; of &quot;cavata&quot;, the act of producing a sound from a musical instrument (especially string instruments), and by extension, the quality of that sound. For example, one can notice the grace of an expert violinist&#x27;s cavata or the richness of the cavata from a cello crafted by an exceptionally skilled luthier. From this meaning comes &quot;cavatina,&quot; understood as the entrance aria of a character in an opera. The Italian plural is &quot;cavatine&quot;. In French, it is the &quot;cavatine&quot; and in German &quot;Kavatine&quot;.

<text>Culbokie (&quot;An Cùil Bhàicidh&quot; in Gaelic, meaning &#x27;the haunted nook&#x27;) is a small village in Ross and Cromarty, Highland, Scotland. It is located on the north side of the Black Isle. The village is south-east of Dingwall and about north of Inverness.

==Village==

There is one school, a shop/post office, a public house (the &quot;Culbokie Inn&quot;) and Findon Hall Community Centre. Culbokie has a range of community and youth groups, including Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Badminton, Playgroup, Football and a Senior Citizens club.

It is known for its spectacular scenery and its old world ambiance including an authentic water pump from the early 19th century.

Since the mid-2000s, the village has expanded significantly and this has resulted in a mismatch of developments. It is unusual in that there is agricultural land separating the east from the west end of the village, in effect making it two entities. 

The village is a commuter location for people who work in Inverness. The new Culbokie Primary School opened at Easter 2007.

== Community Trust ==
In 2014, The Culbokie Community Trust was formed following a consultation with the villagers. The village has seen a rapid growth in population due to new housing developments. Despite this, there was no extra facilities built. A major issue that was raised was the fact that there is no health centre nearby for the village and surrounding area.

In 2015, The Trust purchased of land adjacent to the current village shop and post office. The first phase of development is planned to include the building of a new community hub. The new hub intends to house a cafe, meeting rooms and a healthcare room.

Part of the land is earmarked for affordable housing and as of late-2018 plans have been submitted to the Highland Council for consideration.

Other projects begun by the Trust include; a monthly community market, which sells everything from fresh food to art, and projects in the nearby Culbokie Woods.

<text>Klipsch Audio Technologies (also referred to as Klipsch Speakers or Klipsch Group, Inc.) is an American loudspeaker company based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Founded in Hope, Arkansas, in 1946 as &#x27;Klipsch and Associates&#x27; by Paul W. Klipsch, the company produces loudspeaker drivers and enclosures, as well as complete loudspeakers for high-end, high-fidelity sound systems, public address applications, and personal computers.

On January 6, 2011, Audiovox announced that the company had signed a &quot;term sheet to purchase all the shares of Klipsch Group Inc&quot;. The sale was completed March 1, 2011.

==Horn loading==
Since its inception, Klipsch has promoted the use of horn-loaded speakers as part of its goal to produce speakers featuring:

*High efficiency (more formally called &quot;sensitivity&quot;), meaning that they can be driven by relatively low-powered amplifiers
*Low modulation distortion, which Paul Klipsch believed was very important
*Wide dynamic range, meaning that they accurately reproduce both soft and loud sounds
*Controlled directivity, meaning that the radiation pattern is directional, rather than diffuse
*Flat frequency response, meaning that there is no unnatural emphasis in the bass, mid-range or treble.

The company advocates the superiority of horns for the aforementioned properties, but historically horns have a reputation for a coloring of the sound sometimes described as &quot;honkiness&quot;. The exact causes of this coloration are still being researched, but one cause is vibration of the horn material itself. Early Klipsch designs utilized metal-throated horns whose material could be energized by the sound within, creating a &quot;ring&quot; or &quot;buzz.&quot; Klipsch subsequently introduced horns of braced fiberglass which were said to alleviate resonances that colored the earlier, metal designs. Other causes of &quot;honkiness&quot; are acoustic resonances and reflections when the horn shape causes poor transitions in the acoustic wave expanding from the horn driver. In addition to the direct acoustic effects, these resonances and reflections transform into peaks and dips in the electrical impedance, making problems for the passive crossover network. In 1989, Klipsch introduced a midrange horn with a tractrix flare which was said to reduce &quot;honkiness&quot; and create a more open sound quality, compared to earlier designs. Klipsch also moved away from silk diaphragms to different driver-diaphragm materials like phenolic, aluminum and titanium, to inject a purer sound into the horn in the first place.
Midrange horns made entirely of formed wood were used into the 1950s.

Historically, Klipsch speakers were designed based on principles originating at Bell Labs in the 1930s. Objectives included wide soundstage and frequency range from about 30 Hz to 15 kHz, and the speakers were designed to be placed in a room with no single dimension a multiple of another. For competitors who disregarded this old research, Klipsch made a special &quot;Bullshit&quot; button, inspired by Paul Klipsch&#x27;s extensive usage of the word.

==Products==

===The Klipschorn===
The Klipschorn, or K-Horn, loudspeaker is the flagship product of Klipsch Audio Technologies. It was patented by founder Paul W. Klipsch in 1946 and has been in continuous production in the company&#x27;s Hope, Arkansas, plant since then—the longest run in speaker production history. Although the Klipschorn&#x27;s basic design is more than seventy years old, it has received periodic minor modifications. A &quot;knockoff&quot; (Model K) was offered for years in kit form through Seattle kit manufacturer SpeakerLab.

The Klipschorn&#x27;s large (51” H (129 cm) x 31” W (79 cm) x 28” D (72 cm)) enclosure houses a three-way design: separate drivers—the woofer, the squawker, and the tweeter, respectively—handle the bass, midrange, and treble portions of the sound signal.

Two rectangular horn lenses coupled to compression drivers handle the midrange and treble, while a 15” cone woofer is mounted in a folded bass bin compartment below. The folds open at the rear of the horn cabinet structure, utilizing the room walls and floor as continuations of horn structure, thereby increasing the effective length and size of the horn, thus lowering its cut-off frequency and, likewise, its lowest usable tone.

The body of the speaker cabinet forms a horn. The “K-Horn” shape is like a baseball diamond: the pointy rear is open and exposed, the flat front covered with a wood panel and the top enclosed in cloth. The speaker sits in the corner of two adjoining walls, using the walls and floor boundaries as extensions of the horn. Technically speaking, the K-Horn&#x27;s folded bass &quot;corner horn&quot; can be described as a bifurcated trihedral (floor and two walls to form the trihedral corner) exponential wave transmission line.

This design results in extremely high efficiency. One watt RMS produces a 105 decibel at 1 meter sound pressure level (SPL), which is approximately 14–20 decibels higher than conventional speakers. Such sensitivity requires less amplifier power to achieve the same loudness. (Paul Klipsch demonstrated that the Klipschorn could reproduce concert-level dynamics powered by as little as 1 watt per channel.) The K-Horn encourages the use of low-powered amplifiers. The growing popularity in the audiophile community of single-ended valve (vacuum tube) amplifiers has sparked renewed interest in the Klipschorn and other highly sensitive Klipsch models.

Utilizing the room walls and floor boundaries as extensions of the bass horn helps extend the speaker&#x27;s frequency response down into the 35 Hz range, considerably lower than would be possible otherwise. Because of the folded horn, the woofer cone moves no more than a few millimeters.

As the only speaker in the world to be in continuous production for 70 years, the Klipschorn has remained relatively unchanged since its inception. Circa 1970, diode overload protection was added across voice coils to prevent burnout from clipping produced by an overdriven amplifier. The midrange horn was originally made entirely from formed wood. Some fibreglass bells were used on the midrange horn, as well as metal, in the late 1950s. Eventually the midrange horn was changed from metal to braced fiberglass, and the tweeter was front mounted in the 1980s. Both of these changes reduced the already low distortion. In 2005, the company made some minor cosmetic and functional revisions to this legendary speaker, including the elimination of the inset collar, or spacer, between the upper and lower cabinets for a cleaner appearance. A horizontal wall seal was added to improve the low frequency horn&#x27;s connection to the wall. The crossover, which includes some equalization, was revoiced in the early 2000s.

In 2006, Klipsch offered the 60th Anniversary Klipschorn, a separate model from the standard Klipschorn.

In 2016, Klipsch released the 70th Anniversary Klipschorn with a fully enclosed horn. The release was limited to 70 pairs.

===Other legacy speakers===
Among Klipsch&#x27;s legacy models, the La Scala and the Klipsch Belle, are fully horn-loaded and have extremely high sensitivity similar to the Klipschorn, but their W-shaped folded bass horns do not require corner placement in the listening room. The La Scala II, which uses the same drivers as the Klipschorn but has a smaller bass chamber and less bass extension, was voted into &quot;Stereophile&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Recommended Components&quot; in the &quot;A&quot; class for speakers with restricted extreme low frequency. 
Other models, including the Cornwall and Heresy, use horn tweeters and midranges in conjunction with direct-radiating woofers and also have unusually high sensitivity (although not as high as the fully horn-loaded models).

All of the models cited above feature separate horn-loaded tweeter and midrange. As of 2006, the majority of current Klipsch models are two-way designs, utilizing a tractrix horn for the upper midrange and treble.

Wood finishes available were Macassar ebony, zebrawood, rosewood, teak, cherry, oak oil, oak lacquer, walnut oil, walnut lacquer, raw birch, birch lacquer, and black lacquer. Many dealerships displayed wood samples to let customers view and custom-order the veneers. The Klipsch factory would then specifically match the woodgrain on the tops and sides so pairs of speakers would be identical to each other. In a letter sent to its dealers around 1990, Klipsch cited concern over the responsible use of exotic woods from the rainforests and as a result retired the ebony, zebrawood, rosewood and teak veneers.

===Current speakers===
The Palladium line, introduced in 2007, is a line of premium speakers. These are sold through special qualified dealers only.

The three Icon Series lines (X, W, and V) are diverse products designed to satisfy a variety of tastes and budgets. X=Modern Technology, Contemporary Beauty; W=Modern Technology, Classic Beauty; V=Modern Technology, Value Driven Performance. The trademark of all three is the use of the new 90-degree by 90-degree XT Tractrix horn.

The Synergy line is sold by major mass-market retailers.

The Reference line tends to be carried by audio specialty stores and custom installers. One feature of the Reference line is the use of the trademark Cerametallic woofers. These are a combination of materials that produce a very stiff, highly controlled cone movement.

The newer (2015) Reference Premier series continues improvements with their Hybrid Tractrix Horn, Linear Travel Suspension (LTS)
Titanium Tweeter, Spun Copper Cerametallic Woofers, and an all new Tractrix Port for the cleanest, most powerful low-frequency
response on the market.

THX Ultra II series is a line of dedicated theater speakers and subwoofer.

The Klipschorn, La Scala II, Cornwall IV, Forte IV, and Heresy IV comprise the Heritage line, which is available through select authorized Klipsch dealers and Klipsch direct, often by special order.

In October 2024, Klipsch Audio Technologies announced a partnership with Devon Turnbull.

====Multi-media speakers====
The company also manufactures products for multimedia purposes; its ProMedia line of computer speakers has been sold since 1999, and it produces iPod-marketed speakers like the iGroove (with an angled form-factor).

====Klipsch used in theaters====
Klipsch also features its speaker designs in the Hard Rock Cafe line of restaurants and in several AMC and Regal theaters. Krikorian Theatres have digital sound featuring the Klipsch KMX sound system.

Theaters such as Hollywood&#x27;s BM Theater house are using Klipsch theater systems for the 18000 audience capacity movie house. On a smaller scale, cinemas like Golden Village (Singapore) used Klipsch custom speakers for their GV Grand and IMAX theaters.

===Headphones===
&quot;In Ear&quot; headphones or earphones using balanced armature technology were launched in November 2007. These headphones use patented Contour Ear Gels, invented by Mark Blanchard of Klipsch Group, which are anatomically designed to accurately fit inside the human ear canal. These oval shaped silicone tips reduce ear fatigue by minimizing pressure to any one area of the ear canal wall. The patented ear tips are designed to be inserted in the ear canal to acquire an air seal for noise isolation and a proper frequency response.

In addition to several in-ear Image models, Klipsch launched its first on-ear model, the Image ONE, in 2010.

==== Klipsch in Formula One racing ====
In 2019, McLaren Racing announced a multi-year partnership beginning from the 2020 season, where Klipsch would provide all of McLaren&#x27;s team headsets.

==Group subsidiaries and acquisitions==
Klipsch Group, Inc., the parent company of Klipsch Audio Technologies, also owns the Danish loudspeaker firm Jamo, and in 2006 acquired the brands of Mirage, Athena and Energy from Audio Products International (API) of Canada. In 2001 it acquired the company Mondial Designs, manufacturers of electronics under the Aragon and Acurus brand names, but subsequently discontinued those product lines. In 2009, electronic engineers Ted Moore and Rick Santiago left Klipsch and founded Indy Audio Labs. They purchased the Aragon and Acurus component designs and brands from Klipsch. Both Aragon and Acurus components today are designed and manufactured in Indiana.

=== Energy ===
Energy is a Canadian manufacturer of loudspeakers founded in 1973. They produce the Take, Connoisseur and Veritas product lines. The Energy Take Classic 5.1 HTIB system was named a CNET Editor&#x27;s Choice in 2011. In 2013, Klipsch sued online retailer Monoprice for patent infringement, claiming that Monoprice&#x27;s 5.1 Hi-Fi system was identical to the Take Classic, which was later settled out of court.

===Jamo===
Jamo () is a Danish manufacturer of loudspeakers. The company was founded in 1968 by Preben Jacobsen and his brother-in-law, Julius Mortensen. The company name is derived from the founders&#x27; surnames. At one point, Jamo employed more than 400 workers at its factory in Glyngøre and in 1994 it was Europe&#x27;s largest speaker manufacturer.

In 1998, the company had produced and sold more than 11.5 million units. In 2002, businessman Anders Høiris was hired as director to reverse declining sales. His efforts proved unsuccessful; a major company backer, FSN Capital, then transferred its interest in the brand to Jyske Bank. Høiris then resigned. Company production has, since 2004, been located in China. Jamo was taken over in 2005 by Klipsch Audio Technologies, which Høiris had arranged for before his departure.

<text>Nuh Ha Mim Keller (born 1954) is an American Islamic scholar, teacher and author who lives in Amman. He is a translator of a number of Islamic books.

== Life and scholarship ==
Keller studied philosophy and Arabic at the University of Chicago and the University of California, Los Angeles. Keller converted to Islam from Roman Catholicism in 1977. He has cited Islamic philosopher Seyyed Hossein Nasr&#x27;s writings as one of the reasons for his conversion to Islam.

He then began a prolonged study of the Islamic sciences with prominent scholars in Syria and Jordan and was authorized as a shaykh in 1996.

He joined the Shadhili Sufi order, becoming a disciple of the Sufi poet Sheikh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri of Damascus (from whom he received his authorization) from 1982 until his death in 2004.

His English translation of &quot;Umdat al-Salik&quot;, &quot;Reliance of the Traveller&quot;, (Sunna Books, 1991) is a Shafi&#x27;i manual of Shariah. It is the first Islamic legal work in a European language to receive the certification of Al-Azhar University. 

Keller released a translation of the Quran titled &quot;The Quran Beheld&quot; in 2022 which strives to provide readers with a unique sense of the high eloquence and beauty of the Quran while also maintaining the linguistic and rhetorical accuracy. In the translator&#x27;s own words, &quot;Seven key areas of meaning&quot; were &quot;neglected by previous translations. Such gaps result in crucial elements of the Quran’s themes, logic, arguments, message, and meanings being lost. &quot;The Quran Beheld&quot; thus uncovers matters of Arabic meaning in the Quran for the first time in English.&quot;

Keller has also written numerous articles and was a regular contributor to &quot;Islamica Magazine&quot; and the website masud.co.uk. 

Currently, Keller lives in Amman, Jordan, where he established a &quot;zawiya&quot; (seminary) in the early 2000s. At its height, the community attending the institution is believed to have amounted to around 60 families. However, following Keller&#x27;s ordering the closure of a community school in light of an internal abuse investigation, the size of the community shrank to around 20 families, according to former members. 

He is married to Besa Krasniqi, a scholar who is the daughter of Mazhar Krasniqi.

<text>Moturoa / Rabbit Island is a small island that lies across the southernmost part of Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere, on the northern coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The long narrow island runs east–west for , and covers .

It lies opposite the mouth of the Waimea River, to the west of Richmond. It was formed about 7000 years ago as several barrier islands accumulated near the mouth of the Waimea River. There is evidence of Māori occupation for over 800 years. The original vegetation comprised tussock, manuka scrub and totara forest further inland.
The Rabbit Island Recreation Reserve contains three islands, Rabbit Island, Rough Island and Bird Island, and became a public reserve in 1908. Rabbit Island, with its long, safe swimming beach, is a popular beach resort to the residents of Motueka, Wakefield, Brightwater, Richmond, Māpua, Stoke and Nelson.

A medium-sized causeway spans a tidal area and joins the mainland to Rabbit Island. There is a large grassed area after this bridge and a Fire Hazard sign (&quot;Keep it Green&quot;). Large areas of the relatively flat islands are covered in pine plantation forest. The beach proper contains vast and mountainous sand dunes topped with masses of cone-bearing pines, with exposed roots, extending for long distances along the island.

The Tasman&#x27;s Great Taste Trail, a cycleway running from Richmond to Motueka, runs through Rabbit Island. There is also a newly established equestrian area. The reserve area is closed to the public from dusk to 5 am.

In August 2014, the name of the island was officially altered to Moturoa / Rabbit Island.

<text>The Organization of Ibero-American States (, , ; abbreviated as OEI), formally the Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture, is an international organization made up of 23 members states of Iberophone nations in Europe and the Americas, as well as one member in Africa. The OEI&#x27;s membership is composed of all of the sovereign states of Ibero-America and the Iberian Peninsula, as well as Equatorial Guinea. All members are Portuguese and Spanish speaking nations, in addition to Andorra, which is predominantly Catalan speaking, though the organization does not include all the Iberophone nations of the world.

== History ==

The OEI was founded in 1949 as an international agency, the Office of Latin American Education, as a result of the first Latin American Education Congress in Madrid. In 1954 the second congress was held in Quito, where it was decided that the OEI would become an intergovernmental organization of sovereign states. On March 15, 1957, at the third Education Congress in Santo Domingo, the first statutes of the OEI became effective until 1985.

In 1979, the fourth congress met in Madrid; in 1983 the fifth congress took place in Lima. In May 1985, an extraordinary meeting of the congress was held in Bogotá, where it was decided to change the name of the OEI to its present name (keeping its acronyms and extending its objectives); the Latin American Education Congress became the General Assembly. At the December 1985 directive council meeting in Panama, its members agreed to the present statutes of the OEI, replacing the 1957 text and approving the organization&#x27;s regulations. Since the 1991 Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara, the OEI has promoted conferences of ministers of education and the execution of the educative, scientific and cultural programs delegated to it.

== Objectives ==
The purpose of the OEI is to promote intergovernmental cooperation among its member nations, primarily in the fields of education, science, technology and the arts. Its General Secretariat is located in Madrid. Financing of OEI operations and programs is derived from obligatory quotas and voluntary contributions from the governments of member nations and private cultural and educational institutions and foundations.

* To contribute to the fortification of knowledge, mutual understanding, integration, solidarity and peace among the Ibero-American peoples, and to spread education, science, technology and culture
* To encourage the development of education and culture for peace by preparing people to preserve freedom, solidarity and human rights, supporting change which make these possible
* To collaborate in the interchange of economic, political and cultural influences between Europe and Ibero-America
* To collaborate with its members ensure that their education systems are compassionate, democratic (socially fair) and productive, preparing for working life
* To collaborate in the diffusion of a common culture, respecting the uniqueness of its member states, encouraging global advances in science and technology while retaining cultural identity
* To facilitate relationships among science, technology and society in the Ibero-American countries and citizen understanding of their effects
* To promote the equitable distribution of cultural, Technological and scientific concepts
* To promote lateral cooperation among member states and between the states and other regional institutions
* To contribute to the spread of the Spanish and Portuguese languages, encouraging bilingual education while preserving the multicultural identity of the Ibero-American communities with a multilingual culture

== Structure ==

The OEI consists of three bodies: the General Assembly, the Directive Council and the General Secretariat.

===General Assembly===
The General Assembly, the supreme authority of the organization, is composed of representatives (or delegations) from member States. It establishes OEI policies, evaluates and approves the organization&#x27;s plan of activities, program and global budget, fixes annual dues and chooses the secretary-general.

===Directive Council===
The Directive Council is delegated by the General Assembly to control the OEI&#x27;s government and administration. Made up of the member states&#x27; ministers of education (or their representatives), it is governed by the education minister of the country in which the next General Assembly meeting will be held. Its primary function is to analyze and approve the report of activities, programs, the biennial budget and the OEI&#x27;s financial statement.

===General Secretariat===
The General Secretariat is delegated by the General Assembly as executive director of the OEI, representing it to governments, international organizations and other institutions. It directs, administers and executes the organization&#x27;s programs and projects. The General Secretariat has a flexible internal structure, adaptable according to policies, strategies and the plan of activities.

<doc id="1131435" wikidata="Q873217" url="?curid=1131435" title="List of Stargate comics">
<text>&quot;[[Stargate]]&quot; comics are a series of comic books based on the 1994 science-fiction film of the same name, and the TV series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (1997–2006) and the spin-off &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; (2004–2009). The initial comics were tie-ins with the film and the later output by Avatar Press has been based on the two TV series.

==Movie comic sequels==
A series of &quot;Stargate&quot; film-related comics were published by the independent publishing house Entity Comics between 1996 and 1997, under the creative direction of John Migliore and Bill Maus. Along with a four-part comic book adaptation of the &quot;Stargate&quot; motion picture and three-part adaption of Bill McCay&#x27;s &quot;StarGate: Rebellion&quot;, Entity Comics also wrote their own continuation of the &quot;Stargate&quot; film. &quot;StarGate: One Nation Under Ra&quot; and &quot;StarGate: Underworld&quot; were later published as a trade paperback titled &quot;StarGate: The New Adventures Collection&quot;.

===&quot;StarGate: Doomsday World&quot;===

*Part I - Published in November 1996
::Part I begins with introducing Dr. Joel Murphy, a scientist who was put in charge of the StarGate program on Earth. After an alien corpse is discovered in the South Pacific ocean near a mysterious island, a military team led by Dr. Murphy and Commander Alexandria Klaus is sent to investigate. Ancient ruins that could provide a link between the Aztec and Egyptian cultures are discovered on the island, but the team is attacked by an alien warrior, who manages to kill one of the team members. The alien is impervious to their weapons, and is clad in armor made from the same quartz-like material that all Ra&#x27;s technology is based upon. Dr. Murphy manages to immobilize the warrior by electrocuting it with some technology he brought with him, but the electricity reacts with the quartz mineral worn by the alien, and causes it to explode. After the battle, the team continues on, and finds a second StarGate partially buried under tons of rubble.

*Part II - Published in December 1996
::With the StarGate partially buried under tons of rock, the team decides that their primary objective of moving it is impossible as they lack the necessary excavation materials. With the alien attack, they realize that it is possible that more aliens may come through, and pose a threat to Earth and its inhabitants. Dr. Murphy is ordered to find a way to permanently seal the StarGate, or they will have to fall back on their final back-up plan, which is to drop nuclear bombs on the island. Dr. Murphy examines the StarGate, and discovers that it is different from the &#x27;Gate in Creek Mountain; it is most likely a prototype, and as such it operates differently. The team soon discovers that the island is inhabited when the natives, led by a woman named Regalia, tells them to leave the island or they will attack Dr. Murphy and Commander Klaus&#x27; team in defense of the &quot;Great Gift of Ra.&quot; Commander Klaus attempts to explain the dire nature of the Stargate and the danger that it poses, but Regalia remains unconvinced. A fight breaks out between the two groups, and Dr. Murphy goes back to the StarGate to see what he can do to shut it down for good. Upon arrival, he finds another team member already attempting to do the same, but the soldier accidentally activates the Stargate and gets sucked through. The StarGate shuts off and Dr. Murphy begins his work, until the StarGate is activated again...from the other side. Another alien warrior, identical to the original guardian, emerges from the StarGate, and Regalia breaks off her fight to greet the &quot;Herald of Ra.&quot; Her greeting is met with a blast from the alien warrior&#x27;s weapons, and Regalia decides that maybe Commander Klaus was right about the danger from the StarGate. Dr. Murphy is able to stop the warrior by sending an electronic signal to the prototype StarGate, which activates the StarGate and causes it to attract objects made from the same mineral as itself. The alien warrior is sucked back through the StarGate, but it malfunctions and closes while it is only halfway through. Commander Klaus is concerned that the half of the warrior sent back to its origin might be regarded as an act of war. They decide that the situation has escalated too far, and that the only option left is to nuke the island.

*Part III - Published in January 1997
::Commander Klaus begins the evacuation of the island&#x27;s inhabitants and the other members of her team. She, along with Dr. Murphy and several other soldiers, decide to remain behind and hold off any aliens for as long as possible; if a single alien made it through the StarGate and off the island before the nukes are dropped, it could spell doom for the rest of the planet. After the evacuation is complete and the other people are at a safe distance from the island, Commander Klaus discovers that Regalia is still with them, and is also going to help them hold out against any aliens. True to their prediction, the StarGate activates again, but this time a whole group of alien warriors emerge. A battle breaks out between them, but when the aliens detect the nukes closing in on the island, they retreat back through the StarGate. The team is left behind to face a certain death, until Dr. Murphy realizes that since the Stargate is a prototype, and operates differently from the other StarGate, he might be able to use it differently. He manages to use it to match up with the StarGate in Creek Mountain, and along with Commander Klaus, Regalia and the other surviving soldiers, he uses it to escape the island, which is destroyed seconds after their escape.

===&quot;StarGate: One Nation Under Ra&quot;===

*Part I of I - Published in April 1997
::Dr. Joel Murphy returns from Abydos, where Dr. Daniel Jackson filled in some gaps in Dr. Murphy&#x27;s data about the StarGate and the quartz-like material it&#x27;s made of. He plans on returning immediately with survival gear for Dr. Jackson. Although his new assistant Katerina Moffat advises him to wait due to the severe electrical storm outside of the StarGate facility in Creek Mountain, Dr. Murphy insists on travelling through the Stargate to Abydos. Upon reaching the other side of the StarGate, Dr. Murphy finds himself upon a platform in the middle of a large, opulent city rather than in the center of the pyramid on Abydos. The city resembles Ancient Egypt, but on a much larger, high-tech scale. Dr. Murphy deduces that the electrical storm did have an effect on the operation of the StarGate, and that he is on an entirely different planet. After noticing a large spacecraft identical to Ra&#x27;s flying palace, he hears loud voices closing on his position. As he is a stranger from the StarGate, a group of Horus Guards attempt to capture him and bring him to &quot;Ra.&quot; Dr. Murphy escapes into a crowd of people, plans on biding his time until he can use the Stargate to get back to Earth. As he dashes through the crowd, he accidentally knocks over a young woman. As he apologizes and continues to run away, a large man walks over to the woman. Her name is Shaun&#x27;tra, the leader of this world&#x27;s rebellion against this &quot;Ra,&quot; and the man is Moh-tahn, her faithful friend and confidant. Shaun&#x27;tra suspects that this &quot;Ra&quot; is an impostor, but is every bit as ruthless as the true Ra and must be deposed. Meanwhile, Dr. Murphy continues to evade capture, but is hunted by the same type of alien warrior he faced on the &quot;Doomsday&quot; island. He conjectures that this world is their home planet. Using the survival gear intended for Dr. Jackson on Abydos, Dr. Murphy attempts to hide in an approaching sandstorm. The alien warrior is able to discover him, however, and succeeds in capturing Dr. Murphy. Elsewhere, in the city, Shaun&#x27;tra decides that now is the time to organize their revolt against the impostor Ra. Back in false Ra&#x27;s palace, Dr. Murphy is brought before him. Murphy tells the impostor that he knows that the real Ra is dead, and that the ruler standing before him is a fake. The impostor admits to this charge, and says his name is Pharat-kah, Ra&#x27;s successor. When Ra never returned from Abydos, Pharat-kah knew that the world he was on would be thrown into chaos if they discovered that Ra was dead. He set himself up as Ra, claiming to have returned from Abydos. His story is interrupted, however, as the revolt led by Shaun&#x27;tra begins, and the palace is attacked. Dr. Murphy is released by Shaun&#x27;tra, and makes his way to the StarGate, escaping through it to Earth moments before it is obliterated by the sandstorm and the angry rebels.

===&quot;StarGate: Underworld&quot;===
*Part I of I - Published May 1997
::The StarGate program on Earth has been unable to contact Abydos for several weeks, and Dr. Murphy assumes that the StarGate on Abydos has been shut down from the other side. They bring in the new military advisor, Colonel Jonathan &quot;Jack&quot; O&#x27;Neil, in hope that he will have some answers. Dr. Murphy, Katerina, Commander Klaus, and Catherine Langford each brief Colonel O&#x27;Neil on the current political situation on Abydos. Last time they were in contact with Abydos, there were three separate factions: the first had embraced help from Earth, and was led by Daniel Jackson; the second blamed Earth for all their current problems and, led by a person named Rhantaa, wanted the StarGate shut down for good; and the third group, which includes Kasuf among its members, refuses to believe that Ra is dead, or at the very least expects to see the rise of a successor. The people at the StarGate program have become concerned that the current political situation is responsible for the lack of contact with Abydos. Dr. Murphy believes that he might be able to force the StarGate open for a brief period of time, but only long enough for a one-person jump. O&#x27;Neil is sent through to try to figure out what&#x27;s wrong on Abydos. Upon arrival, O&#x27;Neil is confronted by Skaara and a group of armed Abydans, who attempt to take him under custody. Daniel Jackson arrives on the scene, and when O&#x27;Neil asks him what is going on. Dr. Jackson tells him that the Abydans blame him for their troubles, and that he must be placed under protective custody, and that he must stand trial for his &quot;crimes.&quot; After O&#x27;Neil is imprisoned to await his trial, Dr. Jackson and his wife Sha&#x27;uri come to visit him and give him the answers O&#x27;Neil wants. Apparently, after the death of Ra, the Abydan people began speaking of ghosts from the underworld. Dr. Jackson had originally just thought that it was yet another superstition based on ancient Egyptian myths, until he was attacked by one himself. The &quot;ghost&quot; was actually an outlaw who had not been seen by the Abydan people for years, and was assumed to be dead. Afterwards, Daniel discovered that there was a whole group of these outlaws who were actually living underground, hiding from Ra. When they learned of Ra&#x27;s death, they decided to take over the surface world. The three political factions of Abydos temporarily joined forces to increase their chances against the outlaws, but tensions are still running high. Dr. Jackson tells O&#x27;Neil that he himself shut off the StarGate, knowing that if it had been left active the Underworlders would have destroyed it. Leaving it intact still allowed a chance that someone from Earth could get through. The next day, O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s trial is held, and he is charged with destroying the society on Abydos and for disturbing religious beliefs of the community. Daniel Jackson is able to clear his name before the Abydan people, and they are able to move on to the Underworlder problem. O&#x27;Neil discovers the entrance to the Underworlder base, and assembles a team of warriors from all three factions to attack it. The battle is fierce, but O&#x27;Neil manages to destroy several basins of oil kept near the Underworlder camp, which in turn ignites a gas deposit under the ground. The enemy camp is obliterated, and with the three Abydan factions united once more, and O&#x27;Neil returns to Earth.
==Comics based on the TV series==
Since 2003 the franchise has passed to Avatar Press. There has been no official word as to whether or not the comics are canon.

All series, including preview and special issues, feature several different, alternate limited edition covers for each issue. These usually include painted covers (featuring artists like Lucio Rubira and Ryan Drake), photo covers, wraparound covers, gold, platinum or blue foil covers, leather covers, and glow-in-the-dark covers. Preview and special issues also get special covers usually available only at comic conventions alongside the &quot;Convention Special&quot; comics.

Dynamite Entertainment announced in 2009 that they had acquired the license for the comic books based on the Stargate television franchise.

===&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;===
Based on the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; television show, these are a collection of successive limited series, each featuring a story by James Anthony and art by Jorge Correa.

In 2010 the franchise&#x27;s publisher changed to Dynamite and they published two Stargate miniseries. These series have the distinction of being the only Stargate SG-1 comic series to leave off the &quot;SG-1&quot; and are simply titled &quot;Stargate.&quot;

===&quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;===
In 2006, Avatar Press released the first comic book in a series based on the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; television show. Set in season 1, &quot;Wraithfall&quot; features story by Stuart Moore and art by Mauricio Melo. In this story, the Atlantis team meets the Karrans, a race that has made a bizarre deal with the Wraith.

In 2016, American Mythology launched the first &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; comic since 2007.

===&quot;Stargate Universe&quot;===
In June 2017, American Mythology released the first comic book in a series based on the &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; television show. It is set after the end of season two, however the original creators and writers are not involved. While Eli races against time to repair his damaged stasis pod, a new danger to the ship threatens the fragile plan meant to keep everyone alive.

<text>The Mishmi people are an ethnic group of Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh, India. The area is known as the Mishmi Hills. Only one group, called the Deng, occupy Zayu County in southern Tibet. 

==Clans==
The Mishmi consist of four tribes: Idu Mishmi (&quot;Idu Lhoba&quot;); Digaro tribe (&quot;Taraon, Darang Deng&quot;), Miju Mishmi (&quot;Kaman Deng&quot;), and the Deng Mishmi. The four sub-divisions of the tribe emerged due to the geographical distribution, but racially all the four groups are of the same stock.

The Idu are also known as Yidu Lhoba in Tibet and often referred as Chulikatas in Assam. The Idus are primarily concentrated in the Upper Dibang Valley and Lower Dibang Valley district and parts of the northern part of Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh in India. Taraon, also called Digaru Mishmis, are distributed in the hill and the foothills between the Dibang, Digaru and the Lohit rivers. Kamans are also known as the Miju Mishmis; they live between the Lohit and the Kambang rivers in the foothills and in the Mishmi Hills on both sides of the Lohit river right up to the frontiers to Rima river. There are around 30,000 of them in Arunachal Pradesh.

==Distribution==
===India===
They are located in the northeastern tip of the central Arunachal Pradesh in Upper and Lower Dibang Valley, Lohit and Anjaw Districts, all bordering southern Tibet in northeast India.

===China===
In China, the Mishmi-Idu are classified as Lhoba people.

The Deng people (or &quot;Dengba&quot;, Chinese transcription of Taraon-Kaman languages: 代巴玫; Chinese: 僜人; Hanyu pinyin: Dèng Rén) live in nine villages in Tibet&#x27;s Zayu County and virgin forest areas between the Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains at an elevation of 1,000 metres. Bradley (2007) reports 800 &#x27; (Chinese: Darang Deng) and 200 &#x27; (Chinese: Geman Deng; known as the Kaman or Miju Mishmi in India) in China, one village in Burma where they are known as &quot;Taraung&quot;, and the Taraon, Tayin, or Tain (formerly Digaru Mishmi) in northeastern India.

There is little information on this group due to the sensitivity of the region. The last coordinated effort to understand the Mishmi occurred in the year 1985, after the Chinese academy of social sciences dispatched a total of four anthropologists hailing from the institute of Ethnology and Anthropology.

The Deng Mishmi are not officially recognised by the government of People&#x27;s Republic of China. (Aiyadurai &amp; Lee, 2018) note that instead, &quot;...they are classified as an &#x27;unidentified ethnicity&#x27; or &#x27;others&#x27;, largely due to the nature of a category for characterizing only a handful of people in contemporary China.&quot; Many of them have migrated from China to India.

==History==
=== Under British rule ===
The beginning of British rule in India with regards to the hill people was generally one of non-interference due to a fear of rebellion from these groups.

However, this policy changed when the British began to realize how important the frontier region of Assam and the adjoining hills (including the Mishmi Hills) were for trade.

According to (Aiyadurai &amp; Lee, 2018), &quot;Another strategic reason to manage such an area was that the British were concerned that if they did not take interest in this region, the Mishmi people would end up becoming &#x27;Chinese&#x27; subjects. To win over the local native people, governmental representatives carried with them tea and cigarettes as &#x27;political presents&#x27;&quot;. Officially, it was not until the murder of Noel Williamson (a political officer) and Dr Gregorson (a tea planter and doctor) that the British began to clamp down on the Mishmi in a show of force and dominance.

The British perceived the Mishmi as something to be contained, and not understood. The Mishmi, in 1882, were labelled as “untouched by any civilizing influences”. The natives in general were typically viewed “as less than human and abominable”.

==Culture==
===Creation myth===

It is part of the folklore of the Deng people that their ancestor is Ajiani.

<text>Joseph Gérard Maurice Baril, (born September 22, 1943) is a retired general officer in the Canadian Forces, a Military Advisor to the United Nations Secretary-General &amp; head of the Military Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the United Nations from 1992 to 1997, and Chief of the Defence Staff in Canada from 1997 to 2001.

==Early life==
He was born in Saint-Albert, Quebec, in 1943 and studied at the University of Ottawa from 1961 to 1964, becoming an officer in the Canadian Army in 1963.

==Military career==
Baril served with the Royal 22nd Regiment from 1964 to 1968. From 1968 to 1971, he served with The Canadian Airborne Regiment in Valcartier, Quebec and Edmonton, Alberta.

He was appointed head of the Military Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) at the United Nations in June 1992, where he was military advisor to then under-secretary for peacekeeping operations Kofi Annan.

Baril was in charge of the Military Division at DPKO during the Rwandan genocide where his countryman General Roméo Dallaire was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). He went on to be Chief of Land Force Quebec Area in Montreal in July 1995 and Chief of the Land Staff in September 1996.

<text>Drużyna (&quot;Srzeniawa bez Krzyża&quot;) is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

== Description of the coat of arms ==
=== Modern description ===
In the red field a silver curve. Jewel: Lion&#x27;s head opposite, between two hunting horns with falcon bells of gold.

=== Description by Niesiecki ===
In a field of red, a silver river obliquely, that is, like an S overturned flowing. In the jewel a lion&#x27;s head of gold without a crown between two hunting trumpets, at each of which hang four bells. Some familiars wear it in such a way that they put a cross on the top of the river and call it Śreniawa, others wear the river without the cross and call it Drużyna. Others do not use the lion on the helmet, but only the trumpets themselves.

==History==

The earliest heraldic source mentioning the coat of arms is the Insignia seu clenodia Regis et Regni Poloniae dated 1464–1480 by the Polish historian Jan Długosz, who recognises it as indigenously Polish. He records information about the coat of arms among the 71 oldest Polish noble coats of arms in the passage:&quot;&quot;Druszyna a domo Srzenyawa absque cruce in campo rubeo defert Genus Polonicum in effusionem pronum sanguinis, beati Stanislai reum.&quot; (latina), &quot;Druszyna from the house of Srzenyawa without a cross in a red field brings the Polish race to the shedding of prone blood, guilty of blessed Stanislaus.&quot; (english).&quot;

The Drużyna coat of arms is considered by the some historians and heraldic experts to be an earlier version of the Szreniawa coat of arms. Bartosz Paprocki, in his work Herby Rycerstwa Polskiego, references Jan Długosz, who describes the Szreniawity in death of Bishop Stanisław in 1060. According to this account, the original depiction of the Szreniawa coat of arms featured only the river (represented by a wavy line) without the cross that later became characteristic.

The use of the Drużyna coat of arms persisted among certain noble families, particularly those associated with Jan Kmita, who served as the starosta of Ruthenia and later Cracow in 1371. These families, often related to the starosta, continued to use this simpler version of the coat of arms, emphasizing their connection to the earlier heraldic tradition.

The distinction between the Drużyna and Szreniawa coat of arms marks an evolution in heraldic symbols, reflecting changes in familial alliances, political positions, and possibly the influence of ecclesiastical or regional heraldry. The mention of Drużyna in later records suggests a recognition and perhaps a revival of this original form in certain contexts. 

The Szreniawa coat of arms is one of the traditional Polish heraldic symbols. Initially, it existed without the cross. In 1371, a version of the Szreniawa coat of arms with a cross was adopted, and the name Szreniawa was retained for this modified emblem. Those who continued using the original version of the coat of arms, which lacked the cross, adopted the name Drużyna to differentiate it from the modified version. This change highlights how heraldic symbols could evolve and be distinguished over time based on specific features, such as the inclusion or exclusion of certain elements like a cross.

<text>InstallShield is a proprietary software tool for creating installers or software packages. InstallShield is primarily used for installing software for Microsoft Windows desktop and server platforms, though it can also be used to manage software applications and packages on a variety of handheld and mobile devices.

== Features ==
InstallShield generates a .msi file which can be used on the destination computer in order to install the payloads from the source computer where it was created.
It is possible to specify questions, set prerequisites and registry settings that the user will be able to choose at the installation time.

== Development ==
InstallShield was originally developed by The Stirling Group, a company founded in 1987 by Viresh Bhatia and Rick Harold, who had first met when they were computer science students at Northwestern University. Their first office was a small room in the basement of an old library building in Roselle, Illinois. They were to market a geographic mapping software program, but it was never released.

By 1990, The Stirling Group was selling a package of six products called the SHIELD Series, including InstallShield:

In 1993, The Stirling Group moved into larger offices in Schaumburg, Illinois and changed the company&#x27;s name to Stirling Technologies, Inc. InstallShield became particularly well known after Microsoft endorsed it for use in Windows 95, and by 1997 Stirling Technologies estimated that it was being used in 85 to 90 percent of all software products written for Windows. Since 1996, the company operated under the InstallShield name until Macrovision acquired the business in 2004 for $76 million in cash plus an additional $20 million based on meeting sales targets.

Limited versions of InstallShield were at various times bundled with popular software development packages such as Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, Borland Delphi 2006, and Borland C++Builder.

On 1 April 2008, the Macrovision Software Business Unit (including the InstallShield brand) was sold to private equity firm Thoma Cressey Bravo, forming a new company called Acresso Software. In October 2009, Acresso Software changed its name to Flexera Software.

In May 2020, Flexera rebranded its software monetization division focused on selling to software publishers as Revenera.

<text>Class 252 was the classification allocated to the prototype High Speed Train (HST) unit, numbered 252001.

==History==
When originally built, in 1972, the prototype High Speed Train (HST) units were considered to be formed of two locomotives at either end of a rake of carriages. As a result, the power cars were designated Class 41 and numbered 41001/41002, while the carriages were given numbers in the new Mark 3 carriage number series.

Shortly after their introduction, it was decided to classify the unit as a Diesel Electric Multiple Unit. It was allocated Class 252, and the whole formation was renumbered into a new carriage number series for HST and Advanced Passenger Train vehicles (4xxxx). Two coaches were not included in the renumbering (one Trailer First and one Trailer Second), as these were transferred for use in the Royal Train as part of its upgrade before the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The power cars were allocated numbers in the 43xxx series, and the two prototype cars took the numbers 43000/43001. Thus, the production-run cars were numbered from 43002 onwards.

Ironically, the situation reversed again in the 1980s, and the production power cars were then considered to be class 43, as this time around no power car or carriage was renumbered. By this time, the prototype cars had been transferred into departmental (non-revenue earning) service and had taken numbers in the departmental carriage 975xxx series, so they were not involved in this redesignation, and they retained their departmental carriage numbers rather than being transferred to the departmental locomotive list.

The former 41002/43001 has now been scrapped, but the other prototype locomotive, 41001/43000, was preserved at the National Railway Museum, York. All of the passenger-carrying vehicles are still extant apart from one of the former restaurant cars, scrapped in 1993.

The 125 Group restored prototype powercar 41001 back to operational condition in 2013. This entailed a complete restoration of the vehicle and a fitment of a Paxman Valenta engine at Neville Hill TMD. The engine was successfully started in July 2013, and on 31 May 2014 the loco moved under its own power for the first time in over 30 years.

==Formation==
The vehicles that made up the prototype High Speed Train are listed below, together with their current identity and use:

<text>The Blue Pullmans were luxury trains used from 1960 to 1973 by British Rail. They were the first Pullman diesel multiple units, incorporating several novel features.

Named after their original Nanking blue livery, the trains were conceived under the 1955 Modernisation Plan to create luxury diesel express trains aimed at competing with the motor car and the emerging domestic air travel market. Although not entirely successful – they were seen as underpowered, and ultimately not economically viable – they demonstrated the possibility of fixed-formation multiple-unit inter-city train services, that a decade later was developed as the InterCity 125, which resembled them in having an integral power car at each end of the train.

There were two versions, built by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham: two first-class six-car sets for the London Midland Region (LMR), and three two-class eight-car sets for the Western Region (WR). They were initially operated by the luxury train operator the Pullman Car Company, which the British Transport Commission (BTC) had acquired in 1954. Shortly after their introduction, in 1962, the Pullman Car Company was incorporated into the British Railways network. Originally given the last Pullman vehicle numbers, towards the end of their operational life the trains gained the British Rail TOPS classification of Class 251 (motor cars) and Class 261 (kitchen and parlour cars), although they never carried these numbers.

The WR sets operated from London Paddington to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, and to Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea. The LMR sets operated the &quot;Midland Pullman&quot; between London St Pancras and via the Midland Main Line, a journey it accomplished in a record 3 hours 15 minutes with a maximum speed of . The &quot;Midland Pullman&quot; was withdrawn in 1966 following electrification of the Euston to Manchester line, which brought greatly reduced journey times with which the Midland route could not compete. The LMR sets were then transferred to the WR, where some of the first-class seating was downgraded to form two-class sets.

The sets were an advanced and luxurious design, befitting a Pullman train, although they did suffer some criticism particularly over a persistent ride quality problem. Over time it became costly to maintain such a small fleet of trains. By 1972, with the development of first-class accommodation in Mark 2 coaching stock, the surcharge for Blue Pullmans seemed uneconomical and unreliable to passengers and BR managers, and in 1973 the trains were withdrawn. None were preserved.

The sets featured in three films, one of the same name as a documentary of the design and development, and an observation of the first service. From 2006, the Blue Pullman name was revived as a charter railtour, operated by various companies.

==History==
===Inception===
In June 1954, the BTC, which operated the railways through its British Railways subsidiary, purchased the full equity of the Pullman Car Company, a private operator of luxury carriages on the otherwise nationalised passenger network.

Under the 1955 Modernisation Plan there was a push toward diesel power to replace steam locomotives, and Pullman coaching stock was ageing. The BTC and PCC formed a committee to examine the possibility of running diesel express passenger trains using new trains. Initially proposed as the &quot;Midland Pullman&quot;, it was timed to compete on the London to Manchester route against car and air travel. After being initially rejected for operational reasons, the BTC decided to make use of the reputation of the recently acquired Pullman company to operate the new service. Two six-car units, all first class, were ordered for the LMR, and three eight-car units for the WR in 1957.

===Services===
The selection of Pullman caused some initial delays due to trade union staffing problems, variances in pay and conditions of the Pullman staff compared to BR train staff. After some production delays, the first set appeared for trials in October 1959. These trials revealed that rough ride quality was a problem, and modifications were made. These mitigated the problem, but it was never entirely removed.

After a demonstration run on 24 June 1960, &quot;Midland Pullman&quot; commenced on 4 July 1960, and the WR trains on 12 September. They operated Monday to Friday only. Weekends were reserved for maintenance, and allowed their occasional use on special or charter services to events such as the Grand National.

The &quot;Midland Pullman&quot; ran from 1960 to 1966 in the morning from Manchester Central to London St Pancras calling at Cheadle Heath, a fill-in journey from St Pancras to Leicester, Loughborough, Nottingham and return, and an evening return to Manchester. With completion in 1966 of the electrification of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly, there was the opportunity for a faster electric-locomotive-hauled Pullman service than the diesel sets, and the &quot;Midland Pullman&quot; sets were transferred to the WR in March 1967. The introduction of new non-air conditioned Mark 1 Pullman cars on the East Coast Main Line in 1961 had been questioned as it was believed the ER had not waited for the completion of evaluation of the Blue Pullmans. The later introduction of 2nd-class air-conditioned Mark 2 coaches on these services hastened the perception that the Pullman supplement was not value for money.

The WR &quot;Birmingham Pullman&quot; ran in the morning Wolverhampton Low Level to London Paddington, via Birmingham Snow Hill and through High Wycombe, with a fill-in journey from Paddington to Birmingham Snow Hill and back, before the evening return to Wolverhampton. The &quot;Bristol Pullman&quot; ran from Bristol Temple Meads to London Paddington and back, twice in a day. The two morning services were booked to arrive at the same time at Paddington, giving the possibility of a side-by-side arrival.

From 1961, an additional morning train, the &quot;South Wales Pullman&quot;, operated from Paddington to Cardiff and Swansea.

With the imminent withdrawal of the &quot;Midland Pullman&quot;, in 1965 one operated a trial from London King&#x27;s Cross to Leeds via the East Coast Main Line. However they were not introduced on this route and after the &quot;Midland Pullman&quot; ceased, the sets were transferred to the WR to be used on a new non-stop service for Oxford, and on additional out-and-back services on the Bristol and Swansea routes. The Birmingham services were eventually withdrawn, with the last services being to South Wales.

===Withdrawal===

Towards the end of their operational life, the sets operated as three makeshift sets formed from various original cars to maintain a working service. With declining reliability, the last sets were withdrawn en masse in May 1973. A farewell commemorative special journey out and back from Paddington was run by the Western Region, travelling for 12 hours via High Wycombe, Banbury, Leamington Spa, Kenilworth, Coventry, Birmingham New Street, Cheltenham, Bristol Temple Meads, the Severn Tunnel, Swansea, Cardiff, Bristol Parkway, Didcot and Slough.

===After service===
Ten cars (six Midland and four Western) had been reportedly saved from the scrapyard in July 1975 for preservation, however, none have been preserved.

Some of the motor cars were retained at Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Bath Road TMD until mid-1974 as standby electricity generators during industrial action in the electricity and coal-mining industries.

The Irish national rail and bus operator Córas Iompair Éireann gave &quot;serious consideration&quot; to acquiring (and by implication, re-gauging by exchanging the standard gauge bogies with broad-gauge ones) the Blue Pullman sets but ultimately decided against it.

==Design==

The sets had a maximum speed of . The fixed couplings reduced much of the jerky movement experienced by conventionally buffered carriages and allowed smooth acceleration and stable running. The bogies had hydraulically damped helical springs, and the axles were pneumatically braked in a two-stage system, allowing highly controlled stopping.

They were air-conditioned with automatic humidity control. Motor cars had a large primary diesel engine and generator for motive power, and a secondary Rolls-Royce C8NFLH diesel engine and auxiliary 150 kVA 3-phase 400 V generator beneath the floor provided power for the air-conditioning, fridges and ancillary equipment. A single auxiliary per set was normally sufficient. An onboard Travelling Maintenance Attendant monitored the supply of services.

Seating was 2+1 armchair-type around tables with a table lamp and with steward call button. The saloons were protected from track noise by extra insulation in the bodywork and double-glazed windows with Venetian blinds between the panes.

===Livery===

To emphasise the new type of service, a Nanking blue livery and associated brand image replaced the traditional Pullman livery of brown and cream, and cars bore the word &quot;PULLMAN&quot; rather than individual names. Seating was also different from traditional first-class Pullman cars, increasing from 1+1 to 1+2.

The original livery was Nanking blue with white window surrounds and the Pullman crest on the front and sides. From mid-1966 full wrap-around yellow ends were applied to the driving cars. From October 1967 the sets were repainted in a reverse corporate blue and grey livery, similar to other Pullman coaches and the prototype Class 252, though some retained the Nanking blue livery into 1969.

===Technical details===
Power car (one at each end of set):

* Introduced: 1960
* Weight: 67 tons 10 cwt
* Engine: NBL/MAN 
* Motors: two GEC traction motors (plus two on the adjoining car)
* Maximum tractive effort: Not known
* First, second and third bogies from each end were of 9 ft 6 in wheel centres, all other inboard bogies had 8 ft 6 in centres. The four traction motors at each end were mounted on the second and third bogies.
* Driving wheel diameter: 3 ft 6 in
* Coupling code: Unknown
* Train heating: Electric, powered by Rolls-Royce underfloor engine on adjoining vehicle

===Formation===
The sets were formed from six types of car:
# 1st class motor car, 
# 2nd class motor car, 
# second class parlour car with under-floor diesel generator (see train heating engine above), 
# first class kitchen car with under-floor diesel generator, 
# first class kitchen car, and
# first class parlour car.

The cars were coupled into trains of six or eight cars. Each car was hermetically sealed for the air-conditioning, and all sets were symmetrical, with two kitchen cars serving their respective half of the train. London Midland trains were formed up as [types] 1-4-6-6-4-1, whilst Western region sets ran as 2-3-5-6-6-5-3-2. In an emergency, the buffers on the front of the sets were used in conjunction with a normally concealed coupling hook.

The LMR thus operated two sets of six first-class cars, the WR three sets of eight cars. Withdrawal of the Midland Pullman allowed operation of 12-car formations. The seating in the full length of the parlour cars was augmented by seated sections in the kitchen cars, and motor cars also had a passenger compartment. Kitchen cars and Midland Pullman power cars had one toilet, parlour cars two.

== Recreations ==

In January 2006 charter operator FM Rail revived the &quot;Blue Pullman&quot; brand, repainting two Class 47s and a set of Mark 2 carriages into the original Nanking blue livery. After FM Rail ceased trading, they were operated by Cotswold Rail from February 2007.

In 2020, an HST set operated by Locomotive Services Ltd was repainted in replica Blue Pullman livery. The train made its inaugural run on 12 December that year, from London St Pancras to Crewe and back, and (as of January 2023) offers several railtours every year as the &quot;Midland Pullman&quot;.

==In film==
The units starred in the 1960 British Transport Films &quot;Blue Pullman&quot; directed by James Ritchie, which followed their development, preparation and a journey on the train. As with earlier British Transport films, many of the personnel, scientists, engineers, crew and passengers were featured. It won several awards, including the Technical &amp; Industrial Information section of the Festival for Films for Television in 1961. It is particularly notable for its eerie score, by Clifton Parker.

The units were the subject of the British Transport Film &quot;Let&#x27;s Go To Birmingham&quot; in 1962. This was of a run from London Paddington to Birmingham Snow Hill via Leamington Spa and was largely a sped-up &quot;cab view&quot; film in the style of &quot;London to Brighton in Four Minutes&quot;. The driver in the film, Ernest Morris, was killed on 15 August 1963 in the Knowle and Dorridge rail crash when his express train collided with a freight train at . His train was a &quot;Birmingham Pullman&quot; hauled by a Class 52 &quot;Western&quot; diesel-hydraulic locomotive, a stand-in for the regular Blue Pullman set.

In the 1963 British Transport Film &quot;Snow&quot; there are very short passing shots of a set (5 min 9 sec and 6 min 23 sec), and two views of a LMR set with 6 intermediate cars, in panorama (5 min 10 sec to 5 min 26 sec) and from the cab of an approaching train (5 min 28 sec to 5 min 38 sec).

A Blue Pullman made brief appearances in the 1965 Norman Wisdom film &quot;The Early Bird&quot;, destroying Pitkin&#x27;s milk cart at a level crossing.

==Models==
Kitmaster produced an unpowered polystyrene injection-moulded model kit of car types 1, 4 and 6 at 00 scale. In late 1962, the Kitmaster brand was sold by Rosebud Dolls to Airfix and it is thought the tools were destroyed in a fire, so no further kits were produced. However, examples can still be bought on eBay and the Kitmaster Collectors Club buys and resells built and unbuilt kits.

From 1964 to 1967, Tri-ang (later Tri-ang Hornby) produced ready-to-run models of the type 2 power cars and the type 6 (first class) parlour car.

No models of car types 3 or 5 were ever produced, though brass etchings to convert the window mouldings of Triang types are available, but very rare.

In May 2010, Olivia&#x27;s trains of Sheffield announced its intention to produce a ready-to-run model in association with Heljan models of Denmark. On Bachmann&#x27;s announcement that it would be producing a model, the project was cancelled.

In July 2010, Bachmann announced two Nanking blue versions of the Midland Pullman, with and without full yellow wrap-around ends. The models were released in late 2012 correctly reproducing car types 1, 4 and 6. In December 2012, a &quot;British Railway Modelling&quot; review described the Bachmann model as having &quot;exquisite detail&quot;. In June 2016, Bachmann released a collectors&#x27; edition of the Midland Pullman, which included a book about the Midland Pullman, written by Kevin Robertson, a reproduction menu card, a print of the artwork featured on the box, as well as a set of stewards and train crew figures.

In early 2013, Graham Farish introduced a British N gauge model in Nanking blue. In January 2018, Graham Farish announced planned production of versions of the Western Pullman in grey and blue livery, which was available by the following year.

<text>Yoxall is a village and civil parish in Staffordshire, England. It is on the banks of the River Swarbourn on the A515 road north of Lichfield and south west of Burton upon Trent. South of the village, Yoxall Bridge crosses the River Trent.

The name Yoxall probably comes from Anglo-Saxon = &quot;yoke&#x27;s nook&quot; = &quot;secluded piece of land small enough to be ploughed by one team of oxen, or providing feed for a yoke of oxen&quot;.

==Primary school==
Yoxall St Peter&#x27;s Primary School was built in 1901. In the 1960s the hall, the offices and the junior department were added on to the existing infant department. The school has a licence from the government to keep historical documents, including punishment books, registers and other school documents from the past.

==Scouting==
Yoxall has an active Scout group. It was formerly called Yoxall and Kings Bromley Scout group, however after a large number of children from neighbouring villages joined, it was renamed the Foresters Scout Group. There are approximately 120 children in the three sections.

==Animal rights protest==
In October 2004, an extremist group of animal rights campaigners stole Gladys Hammond&#x27;s body from the village&#x27;s graveyard. A group called the Animal Rights Militia claimed responsibility for the act as an attempt to force the closure of the nearby Darley Oaks Farm, owned and run by family members, where guinea-pigs were bred for medical research. On 23 August 2005 the farm&#x27;s owners announced that they would be ceasing breeding of animals in the hope that Mrs Hammond&#x27;s remains would be returned. Following a police investigation, arrests were made and on 10 April 2006 three men pleaded guilty to blackmail. They were subsequently given substantial prison terms.

==Notable people==

<doc id="1131490" wikidata="Q706344" url="?curid=1131490" title="Idu script">
<text>Idu () was a writing system developed during the Three Kingdoms period of Korea (57 BC-668 AD) to write the Korean language using Chinese characters (&quot;hanja&quot;). It used Hanja to represent both native Korean words and grammatical morphemes as well as Chinese loanwords. The script, which was developed by Buddhist monks, made it possible to record Korean words through their equivalent meaning or sound in Chinese. It was used primarily to write official documents and the imperial examinations from 958 AD-1894 AD.

The term &quot;idu&quot; may refer to various systems of representing Korean phonology through hanja, which were used from the early Three Kingdoms to Joseon periods. In this sense, it includes &quot;hyangchal&quot;, the local writing system used to write vernacular poetry and &quot;gugyeol&quot; writing. Its narrow sense only refers to &quot;idu&quot; proper or the system developed in the Goryeo (918–1392), and first referred to by name in the &quot;Jewang ungi&quot;.

== History ==
The Idu script developed during the Three Kingdoms period of Korea between 57 BC-668 AD. It was used for writing official documents and the imperial examinations from 958 AD-1894 AD. The Idu script was used to write both native Korean expressions as well as Chinese characters (Hanja) that still retained their original meaning and Chinese pronunciation (loanwords). The basic words were commonly Chinese in origin, written in Hanja, and pronounced approximately in the same way as in Chinese (&quot;on&quot;). However unlike Classical Chinese, the Idu script also incorporated Korean words and Korean grammatical morphemes represented using Hanja that only retained their pronunciation but not their original meaning. They were used purely for their phonetic values to represent Korean expressions. The Idu script was written in Korean grammatical word order.

Aside from writing official documents and imperial examinations, the Idu script was also used to clarify Chinese government documents written in Classical Chinese so that they could be understood by Korean readers, to teach Koreans Classical Chinese, and to translate Chinese documents such as the Ming legal code and the &quot;Essentials of agriculture and sericulture&quot; (Nongsan jiyao) (ordered by the King Taejong in 1414).

== Example ==
The following example is from the 1415 book &quot;Yangjam Gyeongheom Chwaryo&quot; (, lit. &#x27;Collected Summary of the Experiences of Silkworm Cultivation&#x27;).

<text>Peggy Pettitt (born February 8, 1950) is an American actress, dancer, teacher, playwright, and storyteller. Pettitt is best known for her role as Billie Jean in the 1972 family–drama film &quot;Black Girl&quot;, starring alongside Brock Peters and Claudia McNeil. Pettitt is a native of St. Louis, Missouri.

==Playwright and storyteller==
The centerpiece of Pettitt&#x27;s theater career is a unique style of solo performance rooted in African-American storytelling. She developed this form to portray a spectrum of characters. Related by blood and circumstance, these characters shed light on the multifaceted history of African American men and women. And they tell &quot;stories addressing important issues of our time.&quot; In collaboration with director Remy Tissier, she has created over 10 original full-length plays. These examine issues of domestic violence, sexual abuse, cross-generational differences, voting registration, the Civil Rights Movement, identity and the world HIV/Aids crisis. Titles include &quot;Women Preachers,&quot; &quot;Caught Between the Devil and The Deep Blue Sea,&quot; &quot;Tricksters: All Over You Like White On Rice,&quot; &quot;Wrapped Up, Tied Up and Tangled,&quot; &quot;Mollie Oil BETWIXT,&quot; &quot;Wild Steps&quot; and &quot;In The Spirit For Real&quot;.

One play was the product of her 2000-01 Fulbright Fellowship to Senegal: &quot;The Spirit Factor&quot;. An original play, it&#x27;s based on the living history and the art of storytelling in West Africa. Another play, &quot;Voyage&quot;, was presented at the Avignon &quot;Off Festival&quot; in 2010. It explores American history through both the blues and a spiritual heritage that lives along the Mississippi River but originated in West Africa. Pettitt has presented her work at the Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni Les Rencontres du Bout des Mondes International Festival in 2011 (French Guiana). In addition to the Fulbright Fellowship, she has received numerous other grants and awards. These include grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts. Pearls of Wisdom is a storytelling ensemble of the Elders Share the Arts in N.Y. City. Pettitt is its founding artistic director, and with the Pearls of Wisdom, she was inducted in 2007 into City Lore&#x27;s People&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Actress==
In 1972, during the era of Blaxploitation movies, Pettitt starred in &quot;Black Girl&quot;, her first feature film. Pettitt was nominated for Best Actress by the NAACP for her role in &quot;Black Girl&quot;, written by J.E. Franklin (from her 1969 WGBH (Boston) teleplay and her 1971 play), and directed by Ossie Davis. Another of her noteworthy roles was at Lincoln Center as Miss Lindsey in &quot;Mule Bone&quot;, Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes’ historical comedy.

==Teacher==
Pettitt has professional experience and training in directing and storytelling workshops. She teaches a step-by-step process of creating, writing and performing original material. Partnering with a wide array of organizations, she has helped scores of diverse groups present their own original stories as both theater and storytelling performances. She also works extensively with drama therapists, social workers and educators in public schools.

Both in the U.S. and abroad, Pettitt has worked at numerous schools and educational institutions. Her teaching experience extends to facilities such as homeless shelters, prisons, drug treatment centers, VA hospitals, and senior and adolescent centers. Additionally she has ample experience working with the emotionally and physically disabled and their families. She currently teaches self-scripting at New York University&#x27;s Experimental Theatre Wing.

==Biography==
In 1974, after earning a BA from Antioch College, she moved to London on a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship. Pettitt now resides in New York City. She has been married since 1982 to writer, director and painter Rémy Tissier.

<doc id="1131493" wikidata="Q77802" url="?curid=1131493" title="Alfred Beit">
<text>Alfred Beit (15 February 1853 – 16 July 1906) was an Anglo-German gold and diamond magnate in South Africa, and a major donor and profiteer of infrastructure development on the African continent. He also donated much money to university education and research in several countries, and was the &quot;silent partner&quot; who structured the capital flight from post-Boer War South Africa to Rhodesia. Beit&#x27;s assets were structured around the so-called Corner House Group, which through its holdings in various companies controlled 37 per cent of the gold produced at the Witwatersrand&#x27;s goldfields in Johannesburg in 1913.

== Life and career ==

Born and brought up in Hamburg, German Confederation, he was the eldest son and second of six children of an affluent Jewish-German citizen of Hamburg. His younger siblings included Otto Beit. Alfred Beit was an unpromising scholar and was apprenticed to Jules Porgès &amp; Cie, the Amsterdam diamond firm where he developed a talent for examining stones.

Beit made his first fortune in property speculation in South Africa. Responding to a demand for business premises, he bought a piece of land and built twelve corrugated iron sheds for offices and rented eleven out monthly and kept one for himself. Twelve years later he sold the land for a considerable profit.

Beit was sent to Kimberly, Cape Colony in 1875 by his firm to buy diamonds—following the diamond strike at Kimberley. He became a business friend of Cecil Rhodes through his role in the Kimberley Central Company. Beit was captivated by Rhodes&#x27;s talk of &#x27;big schemes&#x27;. Together, they proceeded to buy out digging ventures and to eliminate opposition such as Barney Barnato. He rapidly became one of a group of financiers who gained control of the diamond-mining claims in the Central, Dutoitspan, and De Beers mines. Rhodes was the active politician and Beit provided a lot of the planning and financial backing.

Beit&#x27;s diamond interests were mainly concentrated on Kimberley mine. He focused his main attention on the Kimberley Central Company aiming to expand its interests. He had a major role in the rise of Kimberley Central Company.

In 1886 Beit extended his interests to the newly discovered goldfields of the Witwatersrand and met with great success. In his business ventures there he made use of financiers Hermann Eckstein and Sir Joseph Robinson. He founded the Robertson Syndicate and the firm of Wernher, Beit &amp; Co. He imported mining engineers from the US and was among the first to adopt deep-level mining. Rhodes purportedly was granted concessions by Lobengula, as a result of which Beit founded the British South Africa Company in 1888.

Beit became life-governor of De Beers and also a director of numerous other companies such as Rand Mines, Rhodesia Railways and the Beira Railway Company. His South-African assets formed the basis for the Corner House Group, which both controlled holding-companies like the Rand Mines and acted as an important network for several of the leading Randlords of the time.

In 1888 Beit moved to London when he felt he was better able to manage his financial empire and support Rhodes in his Southern African ambitions. Beit moved into Tewin Water, Tewin, near Welwyn, a large Regency house with Victorian additions and 7,000 acres (28 km2), and a few miles away Julius Wernher bought Luton Hoo, with 5,218 acres (21.1 km2). In the 1890s, he had a mansion built in Park Lane – Aldford House.

Inspired by Rhodes&#x27;s imperialist vision, he took part in the planning and financing of the unsuccessful Jameson Raid of late 1895 which was intended to trigger a coup in the South African Republic in the Transvaal. As a result of this debacle, Rhodes resigned as Prime Minister, and both he and Beit were found guilty by the House of Commons inquiry. Beit was obliged to resign as director of the British South Africa Company, but was elected vice-president a few years later. With the death of Rhodes in 1902, Beit, as one of the trustees, helped control the enormous estate, currently being helped by the Oppenheimer family of De Beers and Anglo-American.

Beit never married and had no children. He died at Tewin Water on 16 July 1906 after seeing a rapid deterioration in his health. He left an estate of £8,049,886 (equivalent to £ billion in ).

== The Beit Trust and other donations ==

During his lifetime, Beit made generous donations for scientific work and education. In 1905 he founded a chair of colonial history at the University of Oxford, which is now the &quot;Beit Professorship of History of the British Commonwealth&quot;. In 1906 he made the donation of two million mark to the stock capital of the &quot;Hamburgische Wissenschaftliche Stiftung&quot;, a charity dedicated to spend its interest for the benefit of a precursor of the University of Hamburg.

In his will he set up the Beit Trust through which he bequeathed large sums of money (£1,200,000) for infrastructure development in the former Northern and Southern Rhodesia, later modified to university education and research in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi.

Significant infrastructure projects financed by the Trust include the Birchenough Bridge in the former Southern Rhodesia, named after Sir Henry Birchenough, chairman of the Beit Trust from 1931 until 1937 and whose ashes are buried beneath the structure of the bridge. Ralph Freeman, the bridge&#x27;s designer, was also the structural designer on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and consequently the two bridges bear a close resemblance, although Birchenough is only two-thirds as long as the Australian bridge. It was built by Dorman Long and completed in 1935. At a length of 1,080 feet (329 m) it was the third longest single-arch suspension bridge in the world at the time.

In recognition of his bequests the Royal School of Mines, a faculty of Imperial College London, erected a large memorial to Beit flanking the entrance to its building. The Imperial College hall of residence on Prince Consort Road was named Beit Hall after him.

<text>Set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) is an image compression algorithm that exploits the inherent similarities across the subbands in a wavelet decomposition of an image. The algorithm was developed by Brazilian engineer Amir Said with William A. Pearlman in 1996.

The algorithm codes the most important wavelet transform coefficients first, and transmits the bits so that an increasingly refined copy of the original image can be obtained progressively.

<text>James Grieve is an old variety of apple. It gets its name from its breeder, James Grieve, who raised the apple from pollination of a Pott&#x27;s Seedling or a Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin apple (most likely both) in Edinburgh, Scotland some time before 1893. 

This is a savoury, juicy apple with strong acidity at first, which then mellows as the fruit matures during September, but the flesh softens soon thereafter. When picked early, it makes a sweet and delicate stewed apple, but then can be used as a dessert apple. 
James Grieve apples used to be grown all over Europe and were delivered to the city markets via train or horse-and-cart, but because they bruised easily they had to be carefully packed in laundry-type wicker baskets filled with straw. The fruit cannot sustain modern supermarket handling, and so they are now only grown in gardens and for direct sale to consumers. Nonetheless, James Grieve is considered a good apple because it is exceptionally tasty, it produces fruit every year, it is disease-resistant, and it is a good polleniser for other apples. It may drop early in warm weather. It is also a good apple for making apple juice.

<doc id="1131537" wikidata="Q842380" url="?curid=1131537" title="Second Sudanese Civil War">
<text>The Second Sudanese Civil War was a conflict from 1983 to 2005 between the central Sudanese government and the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army. It was largely a continuation of the First Sudanese Civil War of 1955 to 1972. Although it originated in southern Sudan, the civil war spread to the Nuba mountains and the Blue Nile. It lasted for almost 22 years and is one of the longest civil wars on record. The war resulted in the independence of South Sudan 6 years after the war ended.

Roughly two million people died as a result of war, famine and disease caused by the conflict. Four million people in southern Sudan were displaced at least once, normally repeatedly during the war. The civilian death toll is one of the highest of any war since World War II and was marked by numerous human rights violations, including slavery and mass killings.

==Background and causes==

Wars in Sudan are often characterized as fights between the central government expanding and dominating peoples of the periphery, raising allegations of marginalization. Kingdoms and great powers based along the Nile River have fought against the people of inland Sudan for centuries. Since at least the 18th century, central governments have attempted to regulate and exploit the undeveloped southern and inland regions of Sudan.

Some sources describe the conflict as an ethnoreligious one where the Arab-Muslim central government&#x27;s pursuits to impose Sharia law in 1983 on non-Muslim southerners led to violence, and eventually to the civil war. Douglas Johnson has pointed to exploitative governance as the root cause.

When the British governed Sudan as a colony they administered the northern and southern provinces separately. The south was held to be more similar to the other east-African colonies – Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda – while northern Sudan was more similar to Arabic-speaking Egypt. Northern Arabs were prevented from holding positions of power in the south with its African traditions, and trade was discouraged between the two areas. However, in 1946, the British gave in to northern pressure to integrate the two areas. Arabic was made the language of administration in the south, and northerners began to hold positions there. The southern elite, trained in English, resented the change as they were kept out of government. After decolonization most power was given to the northern elites based in Khartoum, causing unrest in the south. The British moved towards granting Sudan independence, but did not invite southern Sudanese leaders to participate in negotiations during the transitional period in the 1950s. In the post-colonial government of 1953, the Sudanization Committee had only six southerners in its 800 senior administrative positions.

The second war was partially about natural resources. Between the north and the south lie significant oil fields and thus significant foreign interests (the oil revenue is privatized to Western interests as in Nigeria). The northerners wanted to control these resources because they live on the edge of the Sahara desert, which is unsuitable for agricultural development. Oil revenues make up about 70% of Sudan&#x27;s export earnings. Due to the numerous tributaries of the Nile river and heavier precipitation in the south of Sudan, it has superior water access and more fertile land.

There has also been a significant amount of death from warring tribes in the south. Most of the conflict has been between Nuer and Dinka but other ethnic groups have also been involved. These tribal conflicts continued after South Sudanese independence.

The first civil war ended in 1972, with the Addis Ababa Agreement. Part of this agreement gave religious and cultural autonomy to the south. Despite this a number of mutinies by former Anyanya took place in 1974, 1975, and February 1976 with the March 1975 mutiny at Akobo seeing 200 killed, 150 soldiers executed, and 48 more sentenced to imprisonment for up to 15 years.

==Civil War==
===Before 1985===

====Addis Ababa Agreement ended====
The accords of the Addis Ababa Agreement had been incorporated in the Constitution of Sudan; the violation of the agreement led to the second civil war. 

The first violations occurred when President Gaafar Nimeiry attempted to take control of oil fields straddling the north–south border. Oil had been discovered in Bentiu in 1978, in southern Kurdufan and Upper Blue Nile in 1979, the Unity oilfields in 1980 and Adar oilfields in 1981, and in Heglig in 1982. Access to the oil fields meant significant economic benefit to whoever controlled them.

Islamic fundamentalists in the north had been discontented with the Addis Ababa Agreement, which gave relative autonomy to the non-Islamic majority Southern Sudan Autonomous Region. The fundamentalists continued to grow in power, and in 1983 President Nimeiry declared all of Sudan an Islamic state, terminating the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region and starting the Second Sudanese Civil War.

====Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA)====
In May of 1983, the 1st Division&#x27;s 105th Battalion in the Sudanese military mutinied in the towns of Bor, South Sudan and Pibor. Government soldiers moved to suppress the mutiny but were repulsed by the rebels.

The Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA) was founded in 1983 as a rebel group, to reestablish an autonomous southern Sudan by fighting against the central government. While based in southern Sudan, it identified itself as a movement for all oppressed Sudanese citizens, and was led by John Garang. Initially, the SPLA campaigned for a united Sudan, criticizing the central government for policies that were leading to national &quot;disintegration&quot;.

In September 1985 the Government of Sudan announced the end of the state of emergency and dismantled the emergency courts but soon promulgated a new judiciary act, which continued many of the practices of the emergency courts. Despite Nimeiry&#x27;s public assurances that the rights of non-Muslims would be respected, southerners and other non-Muslims remained deeply suspicious.

===1985–1991===

On 6 April 1985, senior military officers led by General Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab mounted a coup. Among the first acts of the new government was to suspend the 1983 constitution, rescind the decree declaring Sudan&#x27;s intent to become an Islamic state, and disband Nimeiry&#x27;s Sudanese Socialist Union. However, the &quot;September laws&quot; instituting Islamic Sharia law were not suspended. 

A 15-member transitional military council was named, chaired by al-Dahab, in 1985. In consultation with an informal conference of political parties, unions, and professional organizations—known as the &quot;Gathering&quot;—the military council appointed an interim civilian cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Dr. Al-Jazuli Daf&#x27;allah. Elections were held in April 1986, and the transitional military council turned over power to a civilian government as promised. The government was headed by Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi of the Umma Party. It consisted of a coalition of the Umma Party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) (formerly the National Unionist Party), the National Islamic Front (NIF) of Hassan al-Turabi, and several southern region parties. This coalition dissolved and reformed several times over the next few years, with Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and his Umma Party always in a central role.

====Negotiation and escalation====
In May 1986, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government coalition began peace negotiations with the SPLA led by Col. John Garang. In that year the SPLA and a number of Sudanese political parties met in Ethiopia and agreed to the &quot;Koka Dam&quot; declaration, which called for abolishing Islamic Sharia law and convening a constitutional conference. In 1988, the SPLA and the DUP agreed on a peace plan calling for the abolition of military pacts with Egypt and Libya, freezing of Sharia law, an end to the state of emergency, and a cease-fire. However, during this period the second civil war intensified in lethality, and the national economy continued to deteriorate. When prices of basic goods were increased in 1988, riots ensued, and the price increases were cancelled. When Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi refused to approve a peace plan reached by the DUP and the SPLA in November 1988, the DUP left the government. The new government consisted essentially of the Umma Party and the Islamic fundamentalist NIF. In February 1989, the army presented Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi with an ultimatum: he could move toward peace or be removed. He chose to form a new government with the DUP, and approved the SPLA/DUP peace plan. A constitutional conference was tentatively planned for September 1989.

====Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation====

On 30 June 1989, however, military officers under Col. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, with alleged NIF instigation and support, replaced Sadiq al-Mahdi&#x27;s government with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation (RCC), a military junta of 15 military officers (reduced to 12 in 1991) assisted by a civilian cabinet. Now a General al-Bashir became: president, chief of state, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces.

The RCC banned trade unions, political parties, and other &quot;non-religious&quot; institutions. About 78,000 members of the army, police, and civil administration were purged in order to reshape the government.

====Criminal Act of 1991====
In March 1991, a new penal code, the Criminal Act of 1991, instituted harsh punishments nationwide, including amputations and stoning. Although the southern states were officially exempt from these Islamic prohibitions and penalties, the 1991 act provided for a possible future application of Islamic Sharia law in the south. In 1993, the government transferred most non-Muslim judges from the south to the north, replacing them with Muslim judges in the south. The introduction of Public Order Police to enforce Sharia law resulted in the arrest, and treatment under Sharia penalties, of southerners and other non-Muslims living in the north.

===Conduct of the war: 1991–2001===
The Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA) was in control of large areas of Equatoria, Bahr al Ghazal, and Upper Nile provinces and also operated in the southern portions of Darfur, Kordofan, and Blue Nile provinces. The government controlled a number of the major southern towns and cities, including Juba, Wau, and Malakal. An informal cease-fire in May broke down in October 1989.

In July 1992, a government offensive seized many parts of southern Sudan, and captured the SPLA headquarters in Torit.

Both the government regular armed forces and the Popular Defense Forces (PDF) were used to attack and raid villages in the south and in the Nuba Mountains. Sudan&#x27;s governments have a long history of using proxies in southern Sudan, and the north–south border areas, to fight their wars and preserve their regular forces. These militias were recruited locally, and with covert ties to the national government. Many of the Khartoum-aligned groups were created and then armed by the NIF in a deliberate &#x27;divide and rule&#x27; strategy. The widespread activity of insurgent and pro-government militants and increasing lawlessness in southern Sudan resulted in the militarization of many communities. Ethnic violence became widespread, and all sides targeted civilians to destroy the power bases and recruitment centers of their rivals. Those who could formed self-defense groups, and these were often based on familial and tribal links as these were the only ones most southern people could still rely on. In this way, groups like the Nuer White Army and Dinka &quot;Titweng&quot; (&quot;cattle guard&quot;) militias came into existence. Even though they were originally intended to just defend civilian communities, they often became brutal gangs which targeted civilians of other ethnicities. The government and rebel groups exploited these tensions and self-defense groups, using them to destabilize their enemies.

The Sudanese Armed Forces became infamous for brutally suppressing all civil dissidents. People suspected of disloyalty or rebel sympathies were arrested and taken to prisons and barracks, where they were tortured and executed. Hundreds, perhaps even thousands of people were murdered at the infamous &quot;White House&quot; – the &quot;Giada&quot; barracks in Juba – alone. At the same time, the SPLA ruthlessly crushed all internal and external opposition as far as possible, including other rebel factions such as the Anyanya II insurgents and critics in its own ranks. Garang became infamous for his authoritarian leadership style, and ordered the torture and execution of several dissenting SPLA commanders. Over time, a growing number of SPLA members became wary of his rule, and began to conspire against him.

====SPLA infighting====
In August 1991, internal dissent among the rebels led opponents of Garang&#x27;s leadership, most importantly Riek Machar and Lam Akol, to attempt a coup against him. It failed, and the dissidents split off to form their own SPLA faction, the SPLA-Nasir. On 15 November 1991, Machar&#x27;s SPLA-Nasir alongside the Nuer White Army carried out the Bor massacre, killing an estimated 2000 Dinka civilians. In September 1992, William Nyuon Bany formed a second rebel faction, and in February 1993, Kerubino Kuanyin Bol formed a third rebel faction. On 5 April 1993, the three dissident rebel factions announced a coalition of their groups called SPLA United at a press conference in Nairobi, Kenya.

====Sudanese alignments====
During 1990 and 1991, the Sudanese government supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This changed American attitudes toward the country. Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration prohibited American investment in the country and supplied money to neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions. The US also began attempts to &quot;isolate&quot; Sudan and began referring to it as a rogue state.

Since 1993, the leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya have pursued a peace initiative for Sudan under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), but results have been mixed. Despite that record, the IGAD initiative promulgated the 1994 Declaration of Principles (DOP) that aimed to identify the essential elements necessary to a just and comprehensive peace settlement; i.e. the relationship between religion and the state, power-sharing, wealth-sharing, and the right of self-determination for the south. The Sudanese Government did not sign the DOP until 1997 after major battlefield losses to the SPLA.

====SPLA alignments====

In 1995, the opposition in the north united with parties from the south to create a coalition of opposition parties called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). This development opened a northeastern front to the civil war, making it a Sudan wide conflict rather than simply a north–south conflict. The SPLA, DUP, and Umma Parties were the key groups forming the NDA, along with several smaller parties and northern ethnic groups.

In 1995, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda stepped up their military assistance to the SPLA to the point of sending active troops into Sudan. Eritrean and Ethiopian military involvement weakened when the two countries entered a border conflict in 1998. Uganda&#x27;s support weakened when it shifted its attention to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

By 1997, seven groups in the government camp, led by former Garang lieutenant Riek Machar, signed the Khartoum Peace Agreement with the NIF, thereby forming the largely symbolic South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF) umbrella. Furthermore, the government signed the Nuba Mountains, and Fashoda agreements with rebel factions. These included the Khartoum agreements that ended military conflict between the government and significant rebel factions. Many of those leaders then moved to Khartoum where they assumed marginal roles in the central government, or collaborated with the government in military engagements against the SPLA. These three agreements paralleled the terms and conditions of the IGAD agreement, calling for a degree of autonomy for the south and the right of self-determination. Nevertheless, the SPLA made major advances in 1997 due to the success of Operation Thunderbolt, an offensive during which the southern Sudanese separatists seized most of Central and Western Equatoria from the government.

In July 2000, the Libyan/Egyptian Joint Initiative on the Sudan called for the establishment of an interim government, power-sharing, constitutional reform, and new elections. Southern critics objected to the joint initiative because it neglected to address issues of the relationship between religion and the state and failed to mention the right of self-determination. Some critics viewed it as more aimed at a resolution among northern political parties and protecting the perceived security interests of Egypt over the unity of Sudan.

===Later operations and peace agreement of 2005===
Peace talks between the southern rebels and the government made substantial progress in 2003 and early 2004, although skirmishes in parts of the south continued. A Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed on 9 January 2005 in Nairobi. The terms of the peace treaty were:

*The south had autonomy for six years, followed by a referendum on independence (the 2011 South Sudanese independence referendum).
*Both sides of the conflict would have merged portions of their armed forces into a 39,000-strong force after six years (the Joint Integrated Units), if the southern Sudanese independence referendum had turned out against secession.
*Oil revenues were divided equally between the government and SPLA during the six-year autonomy period.
*Jobs were split according to varying ratios (central administration: 70 to 30, Abyei/Blue Nile State/Nuba Mountains: 55 to 45, both in favour of the government).
*Islamic Sharia law was applied in the north, while terms of use of Sharia in the south were decided by the elected assembly.

The status of three central and eastern provinces was a point of contention in the negotiations.

According to the SPLA, about 2 million people had died in southern Sudan alone due to the war.

== Post-Civil War effects ==

=== Economy ===
The Second Sudanese Civil War destroyed many sectors of economic activity. The sector with the most damage was the agriculture sector. The conflict forced many farmers to escape the violence and abandon their farmland. Agriculture projects that were meant to improve cultivation methods, some that were funded by the United Nations, were terminated because they were destroyed or people stopped working; such projects include a pump-irrigation system. Additionally, the &quot;animal wealth&quot; of the farmers significantly decreased. Over six million cows, two million sheep, and one million goats were killed during the war.

A different sector that was affected by the conflict was the industrial sector, which consists of manufacturing and processing. Manufacturing facilities were unable to produce essential materials, including soap, textiles, sugar, and processed foods. Processed-foods facilities include the preservation of foods, such as canning fruits and vegetables, and vegetable oil production.

Poverty continued to climb and significantly impacted people in rural areas. The destroyed agriculture sector was the primary source of income for about 8 out of 10 households. Living in a rural region is also associated with a lower quality of life because residents lack access to basic services and economic opportunities and job opportunities.

=== Infrastructure ===
Before the war, Sudan did not have a comprehensive infrastructure system. It lacked roads, bridges, and communications, and led to the existing infrastructure being destroyed. Critical infrastructure, like waterways and canals, were destroyed by airstrikes.

=== Education ===

==== In Sudan ====
When Sudan entered war, education funding was reduced and reallocated to military and security forces. Sudan&#x27;s military spending increased from 10 percent to 20 percent, while reducing spending on education and in other areas. Following the war, education was less likely to be funded, less educators were available due to death or injury, and education facilities were destroyed.

==== In South Sudan ====
As of 2015 42 percent of South Sudan&#x27;s budget is allocated to military and security expenditures. In the same year, only 35 percent of the teachers in South Sudan had a primary-level of education. An additional obstacles students face is the forced recruitment into armed militias and state military. According to a United Nations report, 50 percent of South Sudanese children do not attend school. Boys and girls, who are in schools, are abducted by soldiers and forced to join the military or armed rebel groups. When they are taken, most girls are raped by their captors and those who resist are killed. Boys are &quot;castrated and sexually mutilated&quot;. According to a United Nations report, an estimated 430 children were victims of sexual violence through military recruitment in South Sudan. USAID continues to work on educational initiatives, including granting 9,000 scholarships to boys and girls. They also have over a dozen educational projects and have constructed 140 primary-level schools and four secondary schools. Over 1.4 million students attend or are involved in USAID educational programs in the region.

=== Environment ===
Historically, disputes in Sudan have been over fertile land and water. Oil became a point of dispute following its discovery in Sudan. However, despite the availability of oil, Sudan experiences the paradox of the plenty, a phenomenon that occurs when a country has plentiful natural resources—in this case, oil—but struggles to fully compete economically.

Because of displacement, refugees who fled their destroyed homes cut down forests to survive. They used the wood for fuel, building materials, and to find food.

=== People ===

==== Refugees and displacement ====
The war destroyed towns that were once centers of culture and economic activity. Much of the culture of the southern Sudanese was lost when they fled north as refugees. Tribes and groups that remained in the area fortified their claim on territory and entered into conflict with one another. In a 2019 article in &quot;Ethnopolitics&quot;, Jana Krouse goes over how violence and instability leads to the outward flow of displaced people. Specifically, Krouse&#x27;s article explains how communal violence in South Sudan is intensified and prolonged by the broader instability and regional crises.

Refugee flow continues well past 2012, when &quot;South Sudan–Sudan: State of Emergency&quot; was published. Tensions between the North Sudanese government and the SPLA continued decades after the first wave of displaced peoples fled from South Sudan. Refugees who relocated to other parts of South Sudan soon after faced threats of violence and oftentimes became displaced again.

The continuity of violence across South Sudan has defined the attitudes of South Sudanese living in Khartoum. A University of Khartoum article describes these displaced people as &quot;angry, sad, and disappointed&quot; with the status of South Sudan. The author describes the South Sudanese people as &quot;transnational&quot; and &quot;diasporic&quot;; referring to how widespread displaced people moved as a result of the Second Sudanese Civil War.

==== Women&#x27;s experience ====
During the war, women were heavily supporting the communities and people impacted by the war. Women organized food drives, cooked meals, delivered supplies, cared for the wounded, parented orphans, and assisted the elderly. While male-leaders limited the type of work women to traditional societal roles, the male-leaders promised to change the gender relations during peacetime and after the war.

When the war ended, women engaged in their own organizing, coalition-building, and advocacy—as they had done during the civil war. Women advocated for social change and issues directly impacting women, such as &quot;sexual and gender-based abuse&quot;, education, healthcare, and &quot;access to law and justice&quot;. The increased political involvement enabled the Government of South Sudan to implement an affirmative action policy, in which 25 percent of representation in all levels of government must be allocated to women. Women involved in state affairs led to the founding of multiple advocacy organizations, including the South Sudanese Women Empowerment Network and South Sudanese Women United. These groups have projects around the world, including the United States.

==Foreign interventions==
In 1999, Egypt and Libya initiated the Egypt-Libya Initiative (ELI). By this time the peace process of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) had reached a stalemate. The ELI&#x27;s main purpose had been to bring members of the non-southern opposition (especially opposition in the north) aboard the talks. However, as the ELI avoided contentious issues, such as secession, it lacked support from the SPLA, but the NDA leadership accepted it. By 2001, the ELI had been unable to bring about any agreement between the parties.

In September 2001, former U.S. Senator John Danforth was appointed Special Envoy to the Sudan. His role was to explore the prospects of the US playing a role in ending Sudan&#x27;s civil war and to enhance humanitarian services delivery that could help reduce the suffering of the Sudanese people.

In March 1989, following internal outcry, the government of Sadiq al-Mahdi agreed with the United Nations and donor nations (including the US) on a plan called Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), under which some 100,000 tons of food was moved into both government and SPLA-held areas of Sudan. The OLS helped avert widespread starvation. In 1990 Sudan faced the start of a 2-year drought and food shortage, leading to Phase II of the OLS being approved by both the Government of Sudan and the SPLA. The US, UN, and other donors attempted to mount a coordinated international relief effort in both north and south Sudan to prevent a catastrophe. However, due to Sudan&#x27;s human rights abuses and its pro-Iraqi stance during the Gulf War, many donors cut much of their aid to the Sudan. In a similar drought in 2000 and 2001, the international community again attempted to avert mass starvation in Sudan.

The US government&#x27;s Sudan Peace Act of 21 October 2002 accused Sudan of genocide for killing more than 2 million civilians in the south during the civil war since 1983.

==Arms suppliers==
Prior to the start of the war, the United States had been a major supplier of arms to Sudan but after the start of the war, American assistance dropped, and was eventually cancelled in 1987.

During the 1980s, East Germany supplied the SPLA with AK-47s.

In November 1993, Iran was reported to have financed Sudan&#x27;s purchase of some 20 Chinese ground-attack aircraft. Iran pledged $17 million in financial aid to the Sudanese government, and arranged for $300 million in Chinese arms to be delivered to the Sudanese army.

Meanwhile, the rebel SPLA was supplied weapons via Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda. The Israeli embassy in Kenya also supplied anti-tank missiles to the rebels.

==Child soldiers==
Armies from all sides enlisted children in their ranks. The 2005 agreement required that child soldiers be demobilized and sent home. The SPLA claimed to have let go 16,000 of its child soldiers between 2001 and 2004. However, international observers (UN and Global Report 2004) have found demobilized children have often been re-recruited by the SPLA. As of 2004, there were between 2,500 and 5,000 children serving in the SPLA. The SPLA promised to demobilize all children by the end of 2010.

The Nuer White Army, a minor participant in the war in the Greater Upper Nile region, consisted largely of armed Nuer youths, but it was principally self-organised and often operated autonomously of both elders&#x27; authority and the dictates of the major factions.

=== Notable literary works ===
In the late 1980s, the Second Sudanese Civil War uprooted around 20,000 South Sudanese boys. They walked thousands of miles through Ethiopia to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. Some estimates claim that nearly half of the refugees died along the way due to starvation, dehydration and disease. Once in Kenya, the South Sudanese refugees were accepted into various foreign countries, roughly 4,000 of whom came to the United States. These 4,000 young men pursued higher education and eventually became scholars and authors in their own rights. In 2004, James Disco and Susan Clark created the graphic novel &quot;Echoes of the Lost Boys&quot;, which tells the story of four South Sudanese young men as they integrate into American society.

In 2006, Dave Eggers published &quot;What Is the What&quot;, a fictional autobiography written from the perspective of Valentino Achak Deng. Valentino Achak Deng is a fictionalized South Sudanese refugee that came to the United States under the Lost Boys of Sudan Program. The book was a finalist for National Book of the Year.

These works highlight the continued struggles of people affected by the Second Sudanese Civil War as they attempt to integrate themselves in foreign societies. The main characters in both works struggled against racism, poverty and trauma as they attempted to construct new lives in the United States.

Emmanuel Jal&#x27;s autobiography &quot;War Child: A Child Soldier&#x27;s&quot; revolves around Jal&#x27;s experience as a child soldier during the civil war. It also reveals the internal conflicts of the SPLA that are overlooked. 

==Revival of slavery==

During the war the Sudanese Armed Forces revived the use of enslavement as a weapon against the south, and particularly Christian prisoners of war, on the basis that Islamic law purportedly allowed it.

Muraheleen, armed Baggara herders, were enlisted as militia by the Sudanese government as a low cost part of its counterinsurgency war against the rebel Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), which was identified with the Dinka tribe of southern Sudan. These militias often destroyed Christian villages, executed all their males and then took the women and children as slaves. The first slave raid on the Dinka took place in February 1986. Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid, in February 1987, one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between themselves and their families. The raids continued every year after.

Dinka girls kept in northern Sudanese households were used as sex slaves. Some of them were sold in Libya. Western visitors noted that at slave markets, five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989, female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds to purchase and emancipate these enslaved captives.

<text>John Glendy Sproston (14 August 1828 – 8 June 1862) was an officer in the United States Navy during the Civil War. He was killed in action in a riverine action in Florida.

==Biography==
John G. Sproston was born in Maryland. He was the eldest son of George Saxon Sproston, a U.S. naval surgeon, and Jane Glendy, a daughter of the Rev John Glendy, former Chaplain of the United States Senate. He was appointed to the Naval Academy in 1846. He subsequently served with the Pacific Squadron during the war with Mexico. In 1854, Sproston voyaged to Japan with the Perry (Matthew Calbraith Perry) Expedition.

During the Civil War, he served as commanding officer of &quot;Powhatan&quot; and as executive officer of &quot;Seneca&quot;. On 1 November 1861, during the Battle of Port Royal, Sproston personally fired many of the 11-inch guns on board &quot;Seneca&quot; as the crew was new and untrained. Lt. Sproston was killed on 8 June 1862, while on a boat expedition to destroy a Confederate privateer in the St. Johns River in Florida.

Both John Sproston and his father are buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Namesakes==
USS &quot;Sproston&quot; (DD-173) and USS &quot;Sproston&quot; (DD-577) were named for him.

<text>Václav Kliment Klicpera (23 November 1792 – 15 September 1859) was a Czech playwright, writer, and poet. He was one of the first presenters of Czech drama, and was especially influential in the foundation of comedic Czech theatre.

Klicpera was born in Chlumec nad Cidlinou. After graduating from a gymnasium (a European secondary school) in 1813, he moved to Prague. There he studied philosophy in 1816 and medicine in 1818. In June 1819 he was made a professor at a gymnasium in Hradec Králové. In 1850 he became schoolmaster of a Prague gymnasium.

He was skilled in writing chivalric plays and patriotically-themed historical dramas that became the foundation of modern Czech drama. He is also recognized for his farces (in Czech &quot;frašky&quot;), in the Plautine tradition. He also wrote historical romance stories, plays from his own era, and plays with fairy tale motifs. Klicpera supported the advancement of Czech theatre through the publication of plays in the &quot;Klicpera&#x27;s theatre&quot; edition.

He died in Prague and is buried in the city&#x27;s Olšany Cemetery.

<text>netznetz was a social platform for individuals and groups associated with net art and net culture in Vienna, Austria. The platform was dissolved around 2011 because of internal problems and loss of funding from the city authorities of Vienna.

In a 3-day convention at the Künstlerhaus in October 2004 netznetz.net activists discussed and gathered opinions on the practices, collaborations and future of digital Vienna. The motto &quot;Bring Your Own Devices&quot; was a call beyond the individual scenes to both past and future participants, and offered access to new techniques and strategies in horizontal working situations.

&quot;netznetz.net&quot; suggested a new approach for the distribution of net culture funding to Vienna&#x27;s city government.

== Funding model ==

Netznetz (also: Netznetz Mana) was a system for the distribution of municipal grants developed and run by netznetz in which the participants distributed their own funding according to certain democratically agreed rules and aided by custom software. It was run largely independent of the city government which provides the funds.

The system was striving for guaranteed and dispersed distribution of funding in the sector while the parameters of the distribution were meant to remain flexible, providing a dynamic scope. The aim was to encourage project-based collaborations by distributing various smaller grants. Therefore, everybody who was involved in the sector was subject to the principle of permanent reconfiguration of the system and the network.
The modular funding structure – developed in a drawn-out process of discourse and with the contribution of more than 30 groups – was boldly presented by the community and accepted by the municipal Commissioner for the Arts.

According to the new plan, 50% of the funding (250,000 euro, roughly US$300,000) was reserved for infrastructure (&quot;backbone projects&quot;), newbies (&quot;microgrants&quot;), and common representation (&quot;annual convention&quot;) and was to be distributed by the administration together with the community during the course of an open space conference.
The other half of the funding was to be distributed among the community by the community itself in the form of &quot;network grants&quot;, facilitating the everyday work of contributors, which is usually not supported at all in conventional arts endowment systems.

The process to come up with an ideal system of self-governance amongst the artists was challenging. Many members of the scene were skeptical. Critics feared that the system would lead to increased competition and hostilities between participants, favor well-marketed projects over substantiated ones or that too much trust is placed in as-yet-unproven software. Proponents of the idea cited its independent, democratic, open and non-bureaucratic tendencies as advantages, and stated that it was designed to reward collaboration.

In spring 2009 the City of Vienna started an external evaluation process that decided the future of the self-governed funding model. As a result, parts of the direct community voting mechanisms were replaced by a jury, which is being elected by the community.

netznetz was closed in 2011.

<text>Bo Gunnar Widerberg (; 8 June 1930 – 1 May 1997) was a Swedish film director, writer, editor and actor.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Widerberg was born in Malmö, Malmöhus County, Sweden.

===Career===
Bo Widerberg began his career as a writer. In 1952 came his first novel, &quot;Hösttermin&quot;. In the same year, his short story collection &quot;Kyssas, published by&quot; Bonnier, became a bestseller. His most successful book was the novel &quot;Erotikon&quot; (1957). The novel&#x27;s title comes from Mauritz Stiller&#x27;s silent film classic &quot;Erotikon&quot; (1920). Widerberg&#x27;s last novel is &quot;Den gröna draken&quot;, which was published in 1959 and is a satire on the advertising industry. The book was made into a film by Widerberg himself with the title &quot;Heja Roland!&quot; (1966).

In 1962, Bo Widerberg&#x27;s debate book &quot;The Vision in Swedish Film&quot; appeared. He was critical of the film that had been made in Sweden, not least of all by Ingmar Bergman whom he called &quot;Our spirit&#x27;s Dala horse in the world&quot;, and his films which he likened to &quot;... an export item filled with undisguised exoticism&quot;. The essay collection gave him a chance to direct his own film: Gustav Scheutz surprisingly offered him to make a film at Europafilm. Widerberg made his feature film debut with &quot;The Baby Carriage&quot; (1963) with colleague Jan Troell as photographer, and in the same year came &quot;Raven&#x27;s End&quot; (1963), both with Thommy Berggren in the lead role. With the latter, he made several films, including the American film &quot;Joe Hill&quot; (1971).

The film &quot;Elvira Madigan&quot; (1967) received great international attention, and the lead actress Pia Degermark was awarded Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival that year. &quot;Ådalen 31&quot; (1969), about the Ådalen shootings in 1931 when five demonstrators were shot dead by the military, also received critical acclaim. The film won the Special Grand Prize of the Jury at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association and received multiple awards in the 6th Guldbagge Awards.

The film &quot;The Man on the Roof&quot; (1976) is pioneering Swedish crime film, known among other things for a comically stilted police dialogue and a helicopter crash in central Stockholm. It is based on the 1971 novel &quot;The Abominable Man&quot; by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö. The film won two Guldbagge Awards in 1977, for Best Film and Best Actor (Håkan Serner). In 1984 came another crime film directed by Bo Widerberg, &quot;The Man from Majorca&quot; (1984), this time based on the novel &quot;The Pig Party&quot; by Leif G. W. Persson.

His last feature &quot;All Things Fair&quot; (1995), about a teacher&#x27;s forbidden love affair with a student, played by his son Johan Widerberg, was awarded the Special Jury Prize Silver Bear and the Blue Angel Award at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival, the Audience Award at Gothenburg Film Festival, and 3 Guldbagge Awards. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

Bo Widerberg has also directed theatre, including at Dramaten and Malmö Stadsteater, in addition to TV theater for SVT.

In 1996, he started the well-known Lilla film festival at Bio Scala in Båstad, which occurs annually at the beginning of August; what he called &quot;the film festival of conversation and socializing&quot; for quality film screenings and discussions in the more intimate format. In memory of the founder, the festival has been awarding the Bo Widerberg scholarship since 1997 to filmmakers who work in Widerberg&#x27;s spirit.

===Death and legacy===
Widerberg died in Ängelholm, Sweden on 1 May 1997 of stomach cancer and was buried in the New Cemetery in Båstad. He had four children: Nina, Martin, Johan, and Matilda. Johan has become an actor and his son Martin became a director. As a child, Nina Widerberg acted in five of her father&#x27;s films, including &quot;Barnvagnen&quot; and &quot;The Man on the Roof&quot;. Johan played Detective Kollberg&#x27;s son in &quot;The Man on the Roof&quot;.

In conjunction with the City Tunnel in Malmö, a small plaza around the southern entrance to the train, named Bo Widerberg place, was inaugurated in 2010. The site is located near Widerberg&#x27;s former residence in the city.

==Awards==
He won a Silver Bear prize at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;All Things Fair&quot; and a Special Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Festival for &quot;Ådalen 31&quot;. &quot;Raven&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Ådalen 31&quot; and &quot;All Things Fair&quot; all received a nominations for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. For &quot;Ådalen 31&quot; Widerberg won the Guldbagge Award for Best Director at the 6th Guldbagge Awards. For &quot;The Man on the Roof&quot; he won the award for Best Film at the 13th Guldbagge Awards.

<text>Amel-Marduk (Babylonian cuneiform: &quot;Amēl-Marduk&quot;, meaning &quot;man of Marduk&quot;), also known as Awil-Marduk, or under the biblical rendition of his name, Evil-Merodach (Biblical Hebrew: , &quot;ʾĔwīl Mərōḏaḵ&quot;), was the third emperor of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from 562 BCE until his overthrow and murder in 560 BCE. He was the successor of Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BCE). On account of the small number of surviving cuneiform sources, little is known of Amel-Marduk&#x27;s reign and actions as king.

Amel-Marduk, originally named Nabu-shum-ukin, was not Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s eldest son nor the oldest living son at his appointment as crown prince and heir. It is not clear why Amel-Marduk was appointed by his father as successor, mainly since there appear to have been altercations between the two, possibly involving an attempt by Amel-Marduk to take the throne while his father was still alive. After the conspiracy, Amel-Marduk was imprisoned, possibly together with Jeconiah, the captured king of Judah. Nabu-shum-ukin changed his name to Amel-Marduk upon his release, possibly in reverence of the god Marduk to whom he had prayed.

Amel-Marduk is remembered mainly for releasing Jeconiah after 37 years of imprisonment. Amēl-Marduk is also known to have conducted some building work in Babylon, and possibly elsewhere, though the extent of his projects is unclear. The Babylonians appear to have resented his rule, as Babylonian sources after his reign describe him as incompetent. In 560 BCE, he was overthrown and murdered by his brother-in-law Neriglissar, who thereafter ruled as king.

== Background ==

Amēl-Marduk was the successor of his father, Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC). It seems that the succession to Nebuchadnezzar was troublesome and that the king&#x27;s last years were prone to political instability. In one of the inscriptions written very late in his reign, after Nebuchadnezzar had already ruled for forty years, the king affirms that he had been chosen for kingship by the gods before he had even been born. Stressing divine legitimacy in such a fashion was usually only done by usurpers or if there were political problems with his intended successor. Given that Nebuchadnezzar had been king for several decades, and had been the legitimate heir of his predecessor, the first option seems unlikely.

Amēl-Marduk was chosen as heir during his father&#x27;s reign and is attested as crown prince in 566 BC. Amel-Marduk was not Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s oldest son—another of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s sons, Marduk-nadin-ahi, is attested in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s third year as king (602/601 BC) as an adult in charge of his own lands. Given that Amel-Marduk is attested considerably later, it is probable that Marduk-nadin-ahi was Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s eldest son and legitimate heir, making the reason for the selection of Amēl-Marduk mainly since Marduk-nadin-ahi is attested as living until as late as 563 BC. Additionally, evidence of altercations between Nebuchadnezzar and Amel-Marduk makes his selection as heir seem even more improbable. In one text, Nebuchadnezzar and Amēl-Marduk are both implicated in some conspiracy, with one of the two accused of bad conduct against the temples and people:

The inscription contains accusations, though it is unclear to whom they are directed, concerning the desecration of holy places and the exploitation of the populace—failures in the two main responsibilities of the king of Babylon. The accused is afterwards stated to have cried and prayed to Marduk, Babylon&#x27;s national deity.

Another text from late in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign contains a prayer by an imprisoned son of Nebuchadnezzar named Nabu-shum-ukin ( ), who states that he was imprisoned because of a conspiracy against him. According to the Leviticus Rabbah, a 5th–7th-century AD Midrashic text, Amel-Marduk was imprisoned by his father alongside the captured Judean king Jeconiah (also known as Jehoiachin) because some of the Babylonian officials had proclaimed him king while Nebuchadnezzar was away. The Assyriologist Irving Finkel argued in 1999 that Nabu-shum-ukin was the same person as Amel-Marduk, who changed his name to &quot;man of Marduk&quot; once he was released as reverence towards the god to whom he had prayed. Finkel&#x27;s conclusions have been accepted as convincing by other scholars, and would also explain the previous text, perhaps relating to the same incidents. The &quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel&quot;, a Hebrew work on history possibly written in the 12th century, erroneously states that Amēl-Marduk was Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s eldest son, but that his father sidelined him in favour of his brother, &#x27;Nebuchadnezzar the Younger&#x27; (a fictional figure not attested in any other source), and was thus imprisoned together with Jeconiah until the death of Nebuchadnezzar the Younger, after which Amel-Marduk was made king.

Considering the available evidence, it is possible that Nebuchadnezzar saw Amēl-Marduk as an unworthy heir and sought to replace him with another son. Why Amēl-Marduk nevertheless became king is not clear. Regardless, Amel-Marduk&#x27;s administrative duties probably began before he became king, during the last few weeks or months of his father&#x27;s reign when Nebuchadnezzar was ill and dying. The last known tablet dated to Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign, from Uruk, is dated to the same day, 7 October, as the first known tablet of Amel-Marduk, from Sippar.

== Reign ==
Very few cuneiform sources survive from Amel-Marduk&#x27;s reign, and as such, almost nothing is known of his accomplishments. Despite being the legitimate successor of Nebuchadnezzar, Amēl-Marduk was seemingly met with opposition from the very beginning of his rule, as indicated by the brevity of his tenure as king and by his negative portrayal in later sources. The later Hellenistic-era Babylonian writer and astronomer Berossus wrote that Amēl-Marduk &quot;ruled capriciously and had no regard for the laws&quot; and a cuneiform propaganda text states that he neglected his family, that officials refused to carry out his orders, and that he solely concerned himself with veneration and worship of Marduk. Whether the opposition towards Amel-Marduk resulted from his earlier attempt at conspiracy against his father, the tension between different factions of the royal family (given that he was not the oldest son), or from his mismanagement as king, is not certain. Little is known of Amēl-Marduk&#x27;s immediate family, i.e., his wife and potential children. No sons of Amēl-Marduk are known, but he had at least one daughter named Indû. The &quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel&quot; ascribes three sons to Amēl-Marduk: Regosar, Lebuzer Dukh and Nabhar, though it seems the author confused Amel-Marduk&#x27;s successors for his sons (respectively, Neriglissar, Labashi-Marduk and Nabonidus).

One of his inscriptions suggests that he renovated the Esagila in Babylon, and the Ezida in Borsippa. No concrete archaeological or textual evidence exists to confirm that work was done at these temples. Some bricks and paving stones in Babylon bear his name, indicating that some building work was completed at Babylon during his brief tenure as king.

The Bible states that Amel-Marduk freed Jeconiah, king of Judah, after 37 years of imprisonment in Babylon, the only concrete political act attributed to Amel-Marduk in any extant source. Though such acts of clemency are known from accession ceremonies, and in this case may have been connected to the celebration of the Babylonian New Year&#x27;s Festival, the specific reason for Jeconiah&#x27;s release is not known. Suggested reasons include to win favour with the population of Jewish deportees in Babylonia or that Amēl-Marduk and Jeconiah may have become friends during their imprisonment. Later Jewish tradition held that the release was a deliberate reversal of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s policy, having destroyed the Kingdom of Judah. However, there is no indication that Amel-Marduk made any attempt to restore Judah. Despite this, Jewish contemporaries of Amel-Marduk likely hoped that Jeconiah&#x27;s release was the first step in the restoration of Judah, given that Amēl-Marduk also released Baalezer, the captured king of Tyre, and restored him to his throne. The release of Jeconiah is narrated in 2 Kings 25:27–30, and in the &quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel&quot;, both sources referring to Amel-Marduk as Evil-Merodach. The &quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel&quot; narrates the release of Jeconiah as follows:
== Deposition and Death ==

Amēl-Marduk&#x27;s reign abruptly ended in August 560 BC, after barely two years as king, when he was deposed and murdered by Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, who then claimed the throne. The last document from the reign of Amel-Marduk is a contract dated to 7 August 560 BC, written in Babylon. Four days later, documents dated to Neriglissar are known from Babylon and Uruk. Based on increased economic activity attributed to him in the capital, Neriglissar was at Babylon at the time of the usurpation. The conflict between Amēl-Marduk and Neriglissar was likely a result of inter-family discord rather than some other form of rivalry. Neriglissar was married to one of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s daughters, possibly Kashshaya. As Kashshaya is attested considerably earlier in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign than Amel-Marduk (in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s fifth year, 600/599 BC) and most of the other sons, it is possible that she was older than them. Though the gap between the earliest reference to Kashshaya and those of the sons could be accidental or coincidental; it could also be interpreted as an indication that many of the sons were the progeny of a second marriage. It is therefore possible that Neriglissar&#x27;s usurpation was the result of infighting between an older, wealthier and more influential branch of the royal family represented by Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s daughters, Kashshaya in particular, and a less well-established and younger though more legitimate, branch represented by Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s sons.

== Titles ==

From one of his inscriptions, found on a pillar of one of Babylon&#x27;s bridges, Amēl-Marduk&#x27;s titles read as follows: &quot;Amēl-Marduk, king of Babylon, the one who renovates Esagil and Ezida, son of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.&quot;

Given that few inscriptions of Amēl-Marduk are known, no more elaborate versions of his titulature are known. He may also have used the title &#x27;king of Sumer and Akkad&#x27;, used by other Neo-Babylonian kings.

<text>Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die (Italian: &quot;Se tutte le donne del mondo... (Operazione Paradiso)&quot;) is a James Bond spoof film released in 1966 as an Italian-American co-production between Dino De Laurentiis&#x27; Cinematografica and Columbia Pictures. Directed by Henry Levin, with stars Mike Connors, Dorothy Provine, and as the villain, Raf Vallone, it was originally filmed from January to March 1966 under the title &quot;Operation Paradise&quot; and distributed in some parts of the English-speaking world as &quot;If All the Women in the World&quot;.

==Plot==
Financed by Red China, a Brazilian industrialist plans to sterilize the United States through massive doses of radiation courtesy of his satellite. He double crosses the Chinese by scheming to sterilize the entire Earth, then personally repopulate the planet with beautiful women he has kidnapped and is holding in suspended animation. A down-to-earth CIA agent, an aristocratic female MI-6 agent , and her chauffeur, driving a Rolls-Royce car filled with spy gadgets, team up to stop the madman.

==Background==
An example of the mod Eurospy form, then at the height of its popularity, &quot;Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die&quot; reflected that genre&#x27;s formula of exaggerated semicomic action filmed in colorful locales around the world (Rio de Janeiro in this case), frequently using average-reputation American directors (Henry Levin subsequently directed two Matt Helm films) and American leads best known for starring in television shows and appearing in occasional films. As far as the casting for this production was concerned, Michael Connors had earlier been the star of a 1959–60 crime series, &quot;Tightrope!&quot;, and the following year, after streamlining his stage name to &quot;Mike Connors&quot;, starred as the long-running private eye, &quot;Mannix&quot; (1967–75), while Dorothy Provine was one of the stars in &quot;The Alaskans&quot; (1959–60) and &quot;The Roaring 20&#x27;s&quot; (1960–62). Two years earlier, Provine and Connors played key supporting roles as second leads in the 1964 Jack Lemmon–Romy Schneider comedy vehicle &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot;. All the other &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; cast members were primarily recognizable as regular players in European films, including co-stars Raf Vallone, Margaret Lee, and comedy relief Terry-Thomas, who was given a special &quot;and&quot; billing at the end of the actors&#x27; credits.

This film was rushed into release by Columbia Pictures to avoid colliding with their better-known James Bond satire, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. The plot of &quot;Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die&quot; is similar to the James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot;, which was released 13 years later.

==Production==
Michael Connors recalled that Columbia Pictures gave him the lead after he had been a strong contender for the role of Matt Helm that Dean Martin played. Connors said that Dorothy Provine was whisked to Rome for a week, returning in a glamorous makeover. While Connors portrayed a Sean Connery-type American superspy, Dorothy Provine played her role with an upper-class British accent similar to Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward of the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; TV series. Her character rode a gadget-filled Rolls-Royce driven by an Aloysius Parker-type chauffeur played by Terry-Thomas. The movie was filmed on location in Rio de Janeiro and Rome with Dino De Laurentiis spending a lot of money on production.

Connors also recalled that he did the stuntwork of dangling from a rope ladder attached to a helicopter flying off the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio when the local stuntman refused to do it. Connors said that they were the only film company ever granted permission to film at the landmark.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; was critical of the film stating that &quot;Dino De Laurentiis has made a limp, banal spy spoof, inept in all departments. Pace is plodding, dialog pallid, direction pedestrian, acting an embarrassment, and technical composition awkward.&quot; and that it was an &quot;Unsatisfactory spy spoof for dual bills&quot;.

&quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; (2014 edition) gives &quot;Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die&quot; its lowest rating, BOMB, describing it as a &quot;[D]ull spy spoof&quot; and commenting that &quot;a satellite capable of sterilizing the world&quot; is &quot;something Bond, Flint, and Matt Helm wouldn&#x27;t mind. Awful film.&quot; &quot;Steven H. Scheuer&#x27;s Movies on TV and Videocassette&quot; (1993–1994 edition) had a barely higher opinion, allowing 1½ stars (out of 4) and dispatching it with the final line, &quot;[T]ongue-in-cheek secret-agent stuff doesn&#x27;t come off: a yawn.&quot;

&quot;The Motion Picture Guide&quot; assigned the film its lowest ranking of 1 star (out of 5), proclaiming that &quot;[T]here is little to recommend in this secret-agent spoof&quot; and pointing out that &quot;[E]verything from the sloppy special effects to the irritating music radiates an uncanny cheapness. Dubbed in English.&quot;

Two specialized guidebooks arrive at a split vote. &quot;Michael Weldon&#x27;s Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film&quot; (1983 edition, page 407) agrees with the denigrators, giving it a plot outline that ends with the words, &quot;[T]he worst Bond imitation known to man. With Terry-Thomas, Margaret Lee, Beverly Adams, Marilu Tolo, Nazi scientists, and Communist Chinese. Filmed in Rio De Janeiro. Connors did &quot;Mannix&quot; next.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;John Stanley&#x27;s Creature Features The Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Movie Guide&quot; (2000 edition) decided that &quot;[A]lthough a pale copy of 007&#x27;s exploits, it has a sparkle to its comedy, gorgeous women in figure-flattering wardrobes, and scenic action set against picturesque Rio.&quot; After describing the plot, Stanley concludes with, &quot;Michael Connors walks somnambulistic through his role as super agent Kelly who has minipistols hidden in his clothing and is always eating bananas. A standout is Terry-Thomas as a chauffeur secret agent. Directed by Henry Levin and Dino Maiuri. Dorothy Provine portrays Connors&#x27; charming, sexy contact.&quot;

The sole British cinema compiler to acknowledge the film, Leslie Halliwell in his 1985 &quot;Film and Video Guide&quot; 5th edition, gave no stars (Halliwell&#x27;s top rating is 4), dismissing it as a &quot;[P]atchy James Bond spoof.&quot;

<text>William Charles Wells (24 May 1757 – 18 September 1817) was a Scottish-American physician and printer. He lived a life of extraordinary variety, did some notable medical research, and made the first clear statement about natural selection. He applied the idea to the origin of different skin colours in human races, and from the context it seems he thought it might be applied more widely. Charles Darwin said: &quot;[Wells] distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated&quot;.

== Life ==
Wells was born in Charleston on 24 May 1757, the second son of Mary and Robert Wells, a printer. His parents were Scots who had settled in South Carolina in 1753. He is the brother of Louisa Susannah Wells and Helena Wells.

He was sent to school in Dumfries, Scotland in 1768, at the age of 11, and after completing his preparatory school studies he attended the University of Edinburgh for a year.

Wells returned to Charleston in 1771 and became a medical apprentice under Dr Alexander Garden, a naturalist and physician, who himself was a pupil of Charles Alston, Director of the Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh.

In 1775, soon after the commencement of the American War of Independence, he left Charleston suddenly, and went to London in England. He had been called upon to sign a paper the object of which was to unite the people in a resistance to the claims of the British Government. This he would not do. In 1776 he returned to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine graduating with his medical degree in 1778. In the autumn he returned to London, and attended a course of William Hunter&#x27;s lectures, took instructions in practical Anatomy, and became a surgeon&#x27;s pupil at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital.

In 1779 he went to Holland as a surgeon of the British Army attached to a Scottish regiment. There he received ill-treatment from his commanding officer, and resigned his commission. On the day on which he received his dismissal from the service, he challenged the officer to a duel: the officer refused to respond. Wells then moved to Leiden in the Netherlands and matriculated at the University of Leiden 19 Feb. 1780. On this university he prepared his dissertation. This was the Inaugural Thesis, published at Edinburgh in 1780 when he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine; the subject of his thesis was &quot;Cold&quot; (&quot;De frigore&quot;). The title description of his thesis is: Disputatio medica, inauguralis, de frigore ... - Edinburgi : Balfour et Smellie, 1780.
Early in 1781 he returned to Carolina to put his family&#x27;s affairs in order. He was &quot;at the same time an officer in a corps of volunteers; a printer, a bookseller, and a merchant, a trustee for some of his father&#x27;s friends in England for the management of affairs of considerable importance in Carolina; and on one occasion exercised, at the instance of the Colonel Commandant of the militia, the office of Judge Advocate, in conducting a prosecution in a general court martial of militia officers.&quot; When the British withdrew from Charleston in December 1782, he traveled to St. Augustine, Florida. There he published the &quot;East Florida Gazette&quot;, the first weekly newspaper printed in Florida. Other publications during the British period of Florida included the &quot;Address of the principal inhabitants of East Florida&quot;. He returned to England in 1784 to practice medicine.

In 1790 he was appointed one of the Physicians to the Finsbury Dispensary, and remained so until 1798. In 1793 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1798 he was elected Assistant Physician to St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital; and in 1800 became one of the Physicians. From about 1800, his health was uncertain, and he led a more limited life which was nevertheless fairly productive in medical research.

Wells was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1814. His proposers were William Miller, Lord Glenlee, John Playfair, and Baron Hume nephew of David Hume the philosopher. In the same year the Royal Society of London awarded him the Rumford Medal for his &quot;Essay on Dew&quot;.

He died on 18 September 1817 at Serjeant&#x27;s Inn in London, after suffering symptoms of heart malfunction (auricular fibrillation). He is buried at St Bride&#x27;s Church. His parents, Robert and Mary Wells, are buried nearby. A tablet was erected by Louisa Susannah Wells &quot;as a tribute of duty to her parents and of affection to her brother.&quot;

== Wells&#x27; recognition of natural selection ==
Wells was the elder of three British medical men who formulated evolutionary ideas in the period 1813–1819. He was, arguably, the most successful in this endeavour; the others were James Cowles Prichard and William Lawrence.

In 1813 a paper by Wells was read before the Royal Society; it was published in 1818. This was &quot;Two Essays... with some observations on the causes of the differences of colour and form between the white and negro races of men. By the Late W.C. Wells…with a Memoir of his life, written by himself.&quot;

Wells was clearly interested in how different races might have arisen. After some preliminary remarks on the different races of man, and of the selection of domesticated animals, he observes that:

:&quot;[What was done for animals artificially] seems to be done with equal efficiency, though more slowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which would occur among the first scattered inhabitants, some one would be better fitted than the others to bear the diseases of the country. This race would multiply while the others would decrease, and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the [African] climate, at length [they would] become the most prevalent, if not the only race.&quot;

Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were not aware of this work when they published their theory in 1858, but later Darwin acknowledged:

:&quot;In this paper he [Wells] distinctly recognizes the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to man, and to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and, secondly, that agriculturalists improve their domesticated animals by selection; and then he adds, but what is done in this latter case by art, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they inhabit.&quot;

Credit for the first appreciation of natural selection could therefore go to Wells rather than to Edward Blyth or Patrick Matthew. The triumph is limited to the extent of being applied only to skin colour, and not, as Darwin and Wallace did, to the whole range of life. A form of the idea had already been set out by an earlier Edinburgh author, James Hutton, but in that case the effect was limited to improvement of varieties rather than the formation of new species.

== Wells&#x27; work on dew ==
In the 1780s, Wells and a few others had the idea that dew and frost occurred when the ground was a few degrees colder than the air above. But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, not the other way around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day. Wells concluded that dew is a condensation of water vapor in the air caused by just the right combination of conditions involving especially temperature, temperature change, and heat conductivity of materials.

Wells&#x27; inquiry into the nature of dew were widely cited in the 1830s as an outstanding example of inductive scientific inquiry. Sir John Herschel used it as the primary illustration in his &quot;Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy,&quot; calling the theory, &quot;one of the most beautiful specimens we can call to mind of inductive experimental enquiry lying within a moderate compass.&quot; In 1836, the &quot;Encyclopedia Metropolitana&quot; reported, &quot;We know of no work in our day which has been more universally admired than the Treatise of Dr. Wells, certainly none that practically exemplifies in a purer and better form the admirable inductive system which it was the object of Bacon to teach.&quot; John Tyndall and William Whewell praised it similarly.

== Publications ==
*Wells W.C. 1814. &quot;An essay on dew&quot;. Taylor &amp; Hessay, London. [The basis of his Rumford Medal]
*Wells W.C. 1818. &quot;Two essays: upon a single vision with two eyes, the other on dew&quot;. Constable, London. This contains an appendix titled &quot;An account of a female of the white race of mankind, part of whose skin resembles that of a negro, with some observations on the cause of the differences in colour and form between the white and negro races of man.&quot; [It is this last part which contains the idea of natural selection. The book, which concludes with a memoir of his life, written by himself, contains the material which he had designated for publication before his death; apparently there was other material destroyed on his instructions]. 

Most of his writings on medical subjects are contained in the second and third volumes of the &quot;Transactions of a Society for the Promotion of Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge&quot; 1811-12:
*Observations on Erysipelas.
*An instance of an entire want of hair in the human body.
*Observations on the dropsy which succeeds Scarlet Fever.
*A case of Tetanus, with observations on the disease.
*A case of aneurism of the Aorta, communicating with the Pulmonary artery.
*A case of considerable enlargement of the Cœcum and Colon.
*A case of extensive Gangrene of the cellular membrane between the muscles and skin of the neck and chest.
*On rheumatism of the heart.
*On the presence of the red matter and serum of the blood in the urine of dropsy, which has not originated in Scarlet Fever.
*Observations on Pulmonary Consumption and intermittent fever, chiefly as diseases opposed to each other; with an attempt to arrange several other diseases, according to the alliance or opposition which exists between them, and one or other of the two former.

<text>The Inner London Probation Service existed until 31 March 2001 when it was succeeded by the larger London Probation Area. Its final Chief Probation Officer was John Harding, later visiting professor at the University of Hertfordshire. He succeeded Graham Smith, who went on to be the Chief Inspector of Probation in England and Wales and was knighted towards the end of his career. Seldon Charles Forrester Farmer, OBE was the longest serving Principal Probation Officer for London from 1948 - 1970 when he retired. Seldon Farmer was previously the Principal Probation Officer for the County of Berkshire and the Chair of Napo (trade union) from 1946 - 1949.

==Principal/Chief Probation Officers==
During its 64 year history were
# Guy Clutton-Brock (1937 -1940)
# Ralph Henry Beeson OBE (1941 -1948)
# Seldon Charles Forrester Farmer OBE (1948 - 1970)
# Bill Pearce OBE (1970 - 1980)
# Sir Graham William Smith (1981 - 1992)
# John Harding CBE 1993 - 2001
==Assistant/Deputy Principal/Chief Probation Officers==
&quot;Note: Because of the number of deputies it is not easily possible to give either the terms of office, chronology, nor a comprehensive list.
*Stanley Ratcliffe
* Winifred Joan Woodward (1950-72)
*E George Pratt
*Mr J P Dunphy
*Peter P Shervington OBE (1971- ?)
*Eric Knapman

==History==
At an earlier point it was known as the Inner London Probation and After Care Service.

Its boundaries were the same as ILEA (the Inner London Education Service) and it consisted of the 12 Inner London boroughs.

A book about its early years was written by a former employee. It is now called the London Probation Service and includes some of the outer London Boroughs.

<text>The Railway Procurement Agency () was a state agency of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the Ireland, charged with the development of light railway and the future metro infrastructure.

==History==
The agency was established on 28 December 2001, under the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, and dissolved on 1 August 2015, under the terms of the Roads Act 2015, when all of its functions were transferred to the National Roads Authority (NRA). In order to better reflect its expanded remit, the NRA has since 1 August 2015 described itself for operational purposes as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.

Many of the staff of the agency came from the Light Rail Project Office of Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), which was dissolved upon the RPA&#x27;s inception. The agency operated completely independently of CIÉ. This was due to a fear by the government that CIÉ&#x27;s implementation of new rail projects would be slow and inefficient, as the company is not well regarded by the country&#x27;s political leadership.

==Work==
The RPA&#x27;s main role was overseeing the operation of the Luas system, along with the planning of new Luas and Metro lines for Dublin as laid out under the Irish Government&#x27;s Capital Investment Plan. The operation of the Luas is contracted out to Transdev, and the RPA were responsible for monitoring their performance.
The agency had no role in the mainline railway system, which was and is operated by Iarnród Éireann, itself a subsidiary of CIÉ.

The RPA was also charged with developing an integrated ticketing system for all public transport modes in Dublin. This resulted in the introduction of the TFI Leap Card on 12 December 2011.

==National Transport Authority initiatives==
The RPA had a crucial role in implementing key rail elements of the Irish Government&#x27;s initiatives, administered by the National Transport Authority. It was responsible for the planning, coordination and procurement through conventional means, and through Public Private Partnership, where necessary, of the following projects:
*Dublin Metro, consisting of Metro North and Metro West- deferred indefinitely in 2011
*The RPA was also responsible for planning new Luas lines to Lucan, along with a second Green line extension to Bray

The RPA was also responsible for the following projects, all now complete:
*Connolly Station to Point Depot extension - Red Line (completed in 2009)
*Sandyford to Cherrywood/Brides Glen extension - Green Line (completed in 2010)
*Belgard to Citywest extension - Red Line (completed in 2011)
*St Stephen&#x27;s Green to Broombridge (Luas Cross City) extension - Green Line (completed in 2017)

==Controversies==
=== Luas Red Line engineering ===
In 2006, the RPA were criticised for allowing the Red Line to be opened, in the knowledge that parts of the track support of line were faulty in regards to track support. This became public through an independent report by Austrian consultants.

===Chief Executive dispute===
Early on the CIÉ project director of Luas, Donal Mangan, took legal action as he felt that he had the right to be its chief executive. For two years the agency paid his salary and gave him an office, even though the chief executive&#x27;s position had been filled by Frank Allen.

<doc id="1131611" wikidata="Q1419434" url="?curid=1131611" title="Oneirophrenia">
<text>Oneirophrenia (from the Greek words &quot;&quot; (&quot;oneiros&quot;, &quot;dream&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;phrēn&quot;, &quot;mind&quot;)) is a hallucinatory, dream-like state caused by several conditions such as prolonged sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, or drugs (such as ibogaine). Oneirophrenia is often confused with an acute case of schizophrenia due to the onset of hallucinations. The severity of this condition can range from derealization to complete hallucinations and delusions. Oneirophrenia was described for the first time in the 1950s but was studied more in the 1960s. Although it is still cited in diagnostic manuals of psychiatry, such as DSM-IV and in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), oneirophrenia as a separate entity is out of fashion nowadays.

==History==
Oneirophrenia was studied in the 1950s by the neurologist and psychiatrist Ladislas J. Meduna (1896–1964), also known as the discoverer of one of the forms of shock therapy, using the drug metrazol. Although oneirophrenia was recognized as a specific condition in the 1950s, it was not studied in depth until the 1960s. During its beginning stages oneirophrenia was studied very closely with schizophrenia as an acute form due to the relationship between their symptoms. It wasn&#x27;t until greater research that oneirophrenia became its own mental disease.

Meduna (1950) identified apperception disturbance as a core symptom of oneirophrenia, with primary impacts on sensory modalities: vision, proprioception and interoception (including body image), hearing, smell, and difficulty with central vision (e.g., foggy or hazy vision). Patients often experience a sense of unreality, which they struggle to accept for an extended period. Their reactions to the disorder are influenced by their pre-existing personality, typically beginning with fear and confusion. Oneirophrenia is characterized by &quot;exogenous hallucinations,&quot; similar to those seen in delirium or states induced by psychoactive substances, as opposed to the &quot;endogenous hallucinations&quot; associated with schizophrenia. He proposed that &quot;oneirophrenia, a primary illusionary psychosis, is the clinical result of a disturbance of the carbohydrate metabolism of the brain.&quot;

==Symptoms==
Oneirophrenia is often described as a dream-like state that can lead to hallucinations and confusion. Feelings and emotions are often disturbed but information from the senses is left intact separating it from true schizophrenia.

==Causes==
Oneirophrenia can result from long periods of sleep deprivation or extreme sensory deprivation. The hallucinations in oneirophrenia are increased or derive under decreased sensory input. Psychoanalysts, such as Claudio Naranjo, in the sixties have described the value of ibogaine-induced oneirophrenia for inducing and manipulating free fantasy and dream-like associations in patients under treatment.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===

Oneirophrenia and schizophrenia are often confused although there are distinct differences between the conditions. Oneirophrenia has some of the characteristics of schizophrenia, such as a confusional state and clouding of consciousness, but without presenting the dissociative symptoms which are typical of that disorder. Oneiophrenia often begins with the inability to focus on things while schizophrenia frequently starts with a traumatic event. Persons affected by oneirophrenia have a feeling of dream-like derealization which, in its extreme form, may progress to delusions and hallucinations. Therefore, it is considered a schizophrenia-like acute form of psychosis which remits in about 60% of cases within a period of two years. It is estimated that 50% or more of schizophrenic patients present oneirophrenia at least once.

==Treatments==
Oneirophrenic patients are resistant to insulin and when injected with glucose, these patients take 30 to 50% longer to return to normal glycemia. The meaning of this finding is not known, but it has been hypothesized that it may be due to an insulin antagonist present in the blood during psychosis. However, there is currently no known treatment for oneirophrenia.

<text>The Buffalo, Cleveland and Chicago Railway (BC&amp;C) was a proposed railroad in the United States during the late 19th century. The company was incorporated in the states of New York and Pennsylvania in January 1881 by three New York bankers: Clark, Post, and Martin.

The railroad was to be parallel to William Vanderbilt&#x27;s Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway from the east side of Cleveland to Buffalo, a distance of 185-miles (298 km). The route was surveyed during January and February 1881, but before construction could begin the BC&amp;C was acquired in March 1881 by the Seney Syndicate. Those surveys were promptly used to construct the Buffalo-Cleveland portion of the mainline for that group&#x27;s New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company (later known as the Nickel Plate Road).

<doc id="1131614" wikidata="Q5913741" url="?curid=1131614" title="House Party (radio and TV show)">
<text>House Party is an American radio daytime variety/talk show that aired on CBS Radio and on ABC Radio from January 15, 1945 to October 13, 1967. The show also had a long run on CBS Television as Art Linkletter&#x27;s House Party and, in its final season, The Linkletter Show, airing from September 1, 1952 to September 5, 1969.

The series was launched when producer John Guedel learned that an ad agency wanted to do a new daytime audience participation show, and he pitched a series that would star Art Linkletter. Asked to provide an outline, Guedel and Linkletter came up with a format that would give Linkletter great freedom and allow for spontaneity.

==Broadcast history==

===Radio===
Sponsored by General Electric, the 25-minute &quot;House Party&quot; originated from Columbia Square in Hollywood and premiered on CBS Radio on January 15, 1945. During its first run it was heard weekdays at 4 p.m., three days a week, through January 10, 1947. Following a break, it then ran weekdays at 3:30 p.m. from December 1, 1947 to December 31, 1948. It continued to be sponsored by General Electric even as it switched to ABC Radio, where it ran for 30 minutes in the same timeslot from January 3 to July 1, 1949. ABC then aired it as a 25-minute sustaining program, weekdays at noon from September 19 to December 30, 1949.

The show returned to CBS Radio only days later, making its longest continued run from January 2, 1950 to October 13, 1967 as a 30-minute show running weekdays at various times. Sponsors included Pillsbury from 1950 to 1952, and Lever Brothers from 1952 to 1956. During its first season, the soundtrack from the TV show was run immediately on radio following the telecast.

===Television===
Linkletter and Guedel first spun off the format to television with the prime-time ABC show &quot;Life with Linkletter&quot;, which ran October 6, 1950 to April 25, 1952. Under the title &quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s House Party&quot;, the show premiered on CBS Television on September 1, 1952, and had become television&#x27;s longest-running daytime variety show by the time it completed its run on September 5, 1969. The show ran first at 2:45 pm ET for only fifteen minutes, but by February 1953 it aired from 2:30 pm to 3:00 pm ET, remaining in that time slot for 15 years. From 1968 to 1969, the show aired as a morning show titled &quot;The Linkletter Show&quot;. Linkletter had a similar but unrelated prime-time TV series, &quot;The Art Linkletter Show&quot;, on NBC television from February 18 to September 16, 1963.

The CBS program originated from KNXT. Sponsors were Pillsbury, Green Giant canned vegetables, Kellogg cereals, and Lever Brothers. John Guedel was the producer, Marty Hill was the director, and Jack Slattery was the announcer.

Following CBS&#x27; cancellation of the daytime TV show, NBC Television revived the old ABC series &quot;Life With Linkletter&quot;, this time co-hosted by Linkletter and his son Jack Linkletter. This aired on weekday afternoons from December 29, 1969, to September 25, 1970.

A new, syndicated version of the show, called &quot;House Party with Steve Doocy&quot;, ran during 1990.

==Synopsis==
Hosted by Linkletter, &quot;House Party&quot; featured everything from household hints to hunts for missing heirs. A humorous monologue by Linkletter could be followed by an audience participation quiz to win prizes, musical groups, informal celebrity interviews and guest speakers from assorted walks of life. One popular long running feature of the program was &quot;Guess What&#x27;s In The House&quot;, a game in which studio audience members would be given clues to the contents of a small model of a split level home placed on a center stage podium. A similar concept was later adapted for the &quot;What&#x27;s Inside The Box&quot; segment on the game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. Ideas for the show were devised by producer John Guedel and his father, Walter, but Linkletter never used scripts or rehearsed.

The show&#x27;s best-remembered segment was &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot;, in which Linkletter interviewed schoolchildren between the ages of five and ten. During the segment&#x27;s 27-year run, Linkletter interviewed an estimated 23,000 children. The popularity of the segment led to a TV series with the same title hosted by Bill Cosby on CBS from January 1998 to June 2000, and a revival since 2019.

==Books==
The show&#x27;s popularity led to the books &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot; (Prentice-Hall, 1957) with &quot;House Party&quot; mentioned in the front cover blurb. It was followed by &quot;Kids Still Say the Darndest Things!&quot; (Bernard Geis, 1961), both illustrated by &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoonist Charles M. Schulz. The 1957 book was reissued in 2005 by Ten Speed Press (, )

On 28 August 1913, a contract for two steel freight steamships was signed by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company and the Mallory Steamship Company of the United States. &quot;The vessel will be a single screw steamship of the hurricane deck type with straight stem and elliptical stern, and with deck houses amidship and aft for the crew accommodations...&quot; The original specifications referred to the vessels as hulls No. 175 and No. 176. Hull No. 175 would eventually be named SS &quot;Neches&quot; and hull No. 176 became SS &quot;Medina&quot;. (&quot;Neches&quot; was lost in a collision with a British warship in 1918.) The full contract for the vessels filled a 186-page volume and included the fittings commonly used in a ship for her era and also provision for tropical itineraries; for example, mosquito nets for the crew quarters.

==Terrorist attack==
On 11 August 1991, during the final night of the &quot;Doulos&quot;″ stop in the southern Philippine port of Zamboanga City, two of her foreign crewmembers were killed when a grenade thrown by members of the Abu Sayyaf Islamist terrorist group exploded on stage during a performance by its Christian volunteers. Four locals were killed and 32 others were injured, including several crew members of the missionary ship.

In 1995, in order to conform to the then new SOLAS regulations, she was fitted with a sprinkler system and combustible wall panels were removed and replaced. This unfortunately meant the loss of many of the wall murals that had been installed by Costa Lines.

In 2006, while in Bahrain, a satellite communication system was installed.

==Decommissioning==
In 2009, while &quot;Doulos&quot; was in dry dock in Singapore, a survey conducted by the ship&#x27;s classification society, RINA, found numerous significant problems with the ship&#x27;s machinery, structure, and systems that would require work to have been completed by 31 December 2009 for the ship&#x27;s certificates to be reissued and allow continue sailing. The shipyard servicing the &quot;Doulos&quot; would not accept the ship for repairs until September 2010; with the cost of the work exceeding 10 million euros, and the limited ministry that the ship would have after the repairs, it was decided to end the Doulos Ministry at the end of 2009, instead of 2010 as originally planned. The ship was offered for scrap at the end of 2009 when her operational certification expired. A caretaker crew remained with &quot;Doulos&quot;, expecting to sail her to the breakers.

==New owners==
On 18 March 2010, &quot;Doulos&quot; escaped the breakers and had a new owner, Mr. Eric Saw, director and chief executive of BizNaz Resources International Pte Ltd in Singapore. She was renamed &quot;Doulos Phos&quot; (Servant of Light). In 2015, BizNaz formed a joint venture with two other companies with the intention of converting the ship into a luxury hotel. That August the ship was towed out of Singapore to Batam, Indonesia, to be refurbished before moving to Bintan Island to become part of a US$25 million hotel resort. In October 2015 she went into drydock, where her hull was refurbished. Steel reinforcement bracing was added inside her hull to support her weight on dry land. She was then towed to a location adjacent to the Bandar Bentan Telani Ferry Terminal. Using a system of pulling cables and air bags, the ship was hoisted onto the promontory point. This marked the end of her career as a floating ship.

==Hotel conversion==

In February 2016 the ship was officially renamed &quot;Doulos Phos, The Ship Hotel&quot; and began conversion into a luxury hotel. The conversion is expected to retain the ship&#x27;s bridge and engine room as part of the Maritime Heritage Museum. Decks A and B are used as the hotel. Originally scheduled to open in late 2016, workers and heavy equipment were still on the site in November 2017. The hotel opened in 2019 with 104 rooms, all with a sea view. The hotel closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and has reopened in August 2022.

<text>William Anthony (October 27, 1853 – November 24, 1899) was a soldier in the United States Army and a Marine in the United States Marine Corps, who served during the Spanish–American War.

==Biography==
Born in Albany, New York, Anthony enlisted in the Army on February 1, 1875, and served two five-year enlistments before joining the Marine Corps at Brooklyn, New York, on July 18, 1885. He served ashore (at the New York Navy Yard) and afloat (in the armored cruiser &quot;Brooklyn&quot;) before reporting for duty on May 12, 1897, in the Marine guard of the battleship &quot;Maine&quot;.

An explosion rocked &quot;Maine&quot; as she lay at anchor in Havana Harbor on the night of February 15, 1898. As she began to settle, Private Anthony, who was on watch at the time, hastened immediately forward toward the captain&#x27;s cabin to inform him of the event. In the darkness, the Marine bumped into Captain Charles D. Sigsbee as the latter groped his way toward the outer hatch of the superstructure. Anthony apologized and made his report &quot;that the ship has blown up and is sinking.&quot; The two men then proceeded together toward the quarterdeck.

&quot;The special feature in this case of service performed by Private Anthony,&quot; Sigsbee later recounted in a letter to John D. Long, the Secretary of the Navy, &quot;is that, on an occasion when a man&#x27;s instinct would lead him to safety outside the ship, he started into the superstructure and toward the cabin, irrespective of the danger. &quot;Maine&quot;″s former captain then recommended that the Marine be promoted to sergeant, which was accomplished on April 14, 1898.

Anthony had meanwhile joined the Marine guard of the cruiser &quot;Detroit&quot; on March 5, 1898, and served in that ship until transferred to duty at the Marine Barracks, New York Navy Yard, on September 10, of that year. Upon expiration of his enlistment, Anthony was honorably discharged at New York on June 26, 1899, with the rank of sergeant major.

Anthony died in New York City on November 24, 1899, and was buried at Evergreens Cemetery in Brooklyn five days later.

==Namesake==
USS &quot;Anthony&quot; (DD-172) and USS &quot;Anthony&quot; (DD-515) were named for him.

<doc id="1131624" wikidata="Q95010" url="?curid=1131624" title="Gipuzkoa">
<text>Gipuzkoa ( , ; ; ) is a province of Spain and a historical territory of the autonomous community of the Basque Country. Its capital city is Donostia-San Sebastián. Gipuzkoa shares borders with the French department of Pyrénées-Atlantiques at the northeast, with the province and autonomous community of Navarre at east, Biscay at west, Álava at southwest and the Bay of Biscay to its north. It is located at the easternmost extreme of the Cantabric Sea, in the Bay of Biscay. It has of coast land.

With a total area of , Gipuzkoa is the smallest province of Spain. The province has 89 municipalities and a population of 720,592 inhabitants (2018), from which more than half live in the Donostia-San Sebastián metropolitan area. Apart from the capital, other important cities are Irun, Errenteria, Zarautz, Mondragón, Eibar, Hondarribia, Oñati, Tolosa, Beasain and Pasaia.

Gipuzkoa is the province of the Basque Country in which the Basque language is the most extensively used since 49.1% of its population spoke Basque in 2006.

== Etymology ==
The first recorded name of the province was &quot;Ipuscoa&quot; in a document from the year 1025. During the following years, and in various documents, several similar names appear, such as &quot;Ipuzcoa&quot;, &quot;Ipuçcha&quot;, &quot;Ipuzka&quot;, among others.

The full etymology the word Gipuzkoa has not been fully ascertained, but links have been made with the Basque word , containing the root which is related to the word (north), (back) and (tale). According to this, &quot;ipuzko&quot; (one of the several first known denominations) might refer to something &quot;to the north&quot; or &quot;in the north&quot;.

== Denominations ==

=== &quot;Gipuzkoa&quot; ===
Gipuzkoa is the Basque spelling recommended by the Royal Academy of the Basque Language, and it is commonly used in official documents in that language. The Basque spelling is also mandatory in official texts from the various Spanish public administrations, even in documents written in Spanish. It is the spelling most frequently used by the Spanish-language media in the Basque Country.

It is also the spelling used in the Basque version of the Spanish constitution and in the Basque version of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country. Gipuzkoa is also the only official spelling approved for the historical territory by the Juntas Generales of the province.

=== &quot;Guipúzcoa&quot; ===
&quot;Guipúzcoa&quot; is the spelling in Spanish, and it has been determined by the Association of Spanish Language Academies as being the only correct use outside official Spanish documents in which the Basque spelling is mandatory. It is also the Spanish spelling used in the Spanish version of the Constitution and in the Spanish version of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country.

==Geography and demographics==

At Gipuzkoa is the smallest province in Spain. The province has 88 municipalities and 709,607 inhabitants (2011), a quarter of whom live in the capital, San Sebastián. Other important towns are Irun, Errenteria, Zarautz, Arrasate, Oñati with an old university, Eibar, Tolosa which was the provincial capital for a short time, Beasain, Pasaia, the main port and Hondarribia, an old fort town across from the French Atlantic coast.

Gipuzkoa is hilly and green linking mountain and sea, and heavily populated with numerous urban nuclei that dot the whole territory. The conspicuous presence of hills and rugged terrain has added to a special leaning towards hiking, nature and mountains on the part of Gipuzkoans. Some mountains have an emblematic or iconic significance in the local tradition, their summits being topped with crosses, memorials and mountaineer postboxes. In addition, pilgrimages which have gradually lost their former religious zeal and taken on a more secular slant are sometimes held to their summits. Some renowned mountains are Aiako Harria, Hernio, Txindoki, Aizkorri and Izarraitz, amongst others.
The Aralar Natural Park is a conservation area on the border of Gipuzkoa and Navarre in the Aralar Range.

The rivers of Gipuzkoa are distinctly different from other Bay of Biscay rivers. They arise in the hilly Basque inland landscape (&quot;Basque Mountains&quot;), flow in a south- north direction, forming close, narrow valleys before joining the ocean. The rivers extend for a short length with only a small fluctuation in the volume of water thanks to the stable rainfall all year round, and they show an abrupt drop between origin and mouth as far as the length of the river is concerned. From west to east the rivers are the Deba, Urola, Oria, Urumea, Oiartzun and Bidasoa. Except for a narrow strip extending east from the hamlet &quot;Otzaurte&quot; (Zegama) and the tunnel of San Adrian, the province drains its waters to the Atlantic basin.

=== Population development ===
The historical population is given in the following chart:

==Climate==
Gipuzkoa has an oceanic climate, characterized by its low variation in temperature, with cool summers, moderate winters and abundant rain throughout the year. The climate promotes the growth of lush vegetation.

The area is windy for most of the year with those from the north-northwest bringing significant moisture from the ocean. Rainfall is abundant due to the wind direction and hilly region of the province, with rainfall ranging between 1200 and 1700 mm per year. Cloud cover is also high.

The climate is oceanic, with few thermal fluctuations and abundant rainfall (1400 mm per year). The rainfall and relief have a hydrography defined by rivers of short length, although large and regular; The main ones are the Bidasoa, the Oyarzun, the Urumea, the Oria, the Urola and the Deva. Their agricultural utility, as a consequence of the rainfall, is minimal, although they have been the basis of an industry that has ended up contaminating its waters. The predominant vegetation, also conditioned by the climate, is the boreal forest, with deciduous species that alternate with meadows.

==Infrastructure==


The region&#x27;s communication layout is in step with its geographical features, with the main lines of infrastructure along a north -south axis up to recent times along the rivers heading to the ocean. Accordingly, the inland Way of St. James, i.e. the Tunnel Route penetrated the province via Irun and turned south-west along the Oria River towards the provincial limits at the tunnel of San Adrian. This stretch was in operation up to 1765 when the Royal Road moved to the western Deba Valley. A minor St. James route crossed Gipuzkoa east to west along the coast.

Currently, the main road cutting through Gipuzkoa largely follows that layout, i.e. the N-1 E-5 from Irun to Donostia and on to Altsasu all along the Oria River for the most part (gateway to Navarre through the pass of Etxegarate). Also, the major Irun-Madrid railway runs close to the river up to its very origin on the slopes of Aizkorri at train stop Otzaurte in Zegama. By 1973 engineering works for the Bilbao-Behobia A-8 E-70 motorway had been completed, with the new road cutting across the valleys east to west and turning into the main axis between Donostia and Bilbao, besides enabling heavy load traffic to access the west and south of Spain as a toll road. The regional railway network Euskotren Trena also follows along the coast from east to west, while it proves impractical for long distance on the grounds of its tortuous layout and as it serves small towns. The railway network reaches the border town Hendaia before it changes to SNCF. Within the Donostialdea region, the San Sebastián Metro provides service.

The stretch of the A-15 motorway serving Gipuzkoa and Pamplona opened in 1995 embroiled in controversy under protest and an attack campaign led by ecologists, Basque leftist nationalists and eventually ETA. Conflict resolved after a deal about the definitive layout was struck. In January 2010, following a scheme drawn up by the regional government of Gipuzkoa to improve provisions for the ever-increasing road traffic, the Maltzaga-Urbina AP-1 motorway stretch leading to Gasteiz was completed, providing likewise access to the industrial areas of Arrasate and Bergara, the gateway to Álava by village Landa. AP-1 and N-1 E-5 are connected by a highway east to west from Bergara and Beasain. European traffic to south of Spain avoids Donostia&#x27;s metropolitan area by means of the southern outer road ring.

The AVE high-speed rail is currently under construction, with an Y-type layout and links to the SNCF network in Hendaia (NE), Vitoria (SE), Bilbao (W) and Pamplona (S) to be completed by 2022. Contractors were appointed, works are in place although past schedule, while strong opposition (ecologists, Basque leftist nationalists...) and serious financial tensions made its future uncertain.

The only airport in Gipuzkoa serving just domestic flights is the San Sebastian Airport located in Hondarribia, while the air transportation needs are usually served by the nearby Bilbao and Biarritz airports.

==Cultural traits==
Gipuzkera, a dialect of the Basque language spoken in most of the region, shows a considerable vitality and holds a prominent position among other dialects. A 2021 survey found that 51.8% of the population spoke Basque.

The Basque cultural element is apparent, including traditional dances and singing, bertsolaritza, trikiti and txistu music, baserris dotting the rural landscape, town festivals, and its signature heavy sculptures (stone, steel, iron) from the industrial tradition, all blending with the latest Basque, Spanish and international pop culture events and design trends centred in major urban areas (Donostia, Tolosa, etc.).

Traditionally a Catholic province, its patron saints are the Society of Jesus&#x27; Ignatius of Loyola, a native of this province born in the neighborhood of Loyola (Azpeitia), and Our Lady of Arantzazu.

The region has produced many famous Basque athletes for example: Jose Maria Olazabal (golfer), José Ángel Iribar, Mikel Arteta and Xabi Alonso (footballers), Abraham Olano and Domingo Perurena (cyclists), Edurne Pasaban and Alberto Iñurrategi (mountaineers), Iñaki Urdangarin (handball player), Maite Zúñiga (runner) and Paulino Uzcudun (boxer). Professional tennis player Garbiñe Muguruza&#x27;s father is also a native of Gipuzkoa.

<doc id="1131625" wikidata="Q500507" url="?curid=1131625" title="Giovanni Animuccia">
<text>Giovanni Animuccia ( – March 1571) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance who was involved in the heart of Rome&#x27;s liturgical musical life. He was one of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina&#x27;s most important predecessors and possibly his mentor. As &quot; of St Philip Neri&#x27;s Oratory and the Capella Giulia at St Peter&#x27;s, he was composing music at the very center of the Roman Catholic Church, during the turbulent reforms of the Counter-Reformation and as part of the new movements that began to flourish around the middle of the century. His music reflects these changes.

==Early life: Florence==
Animuccia was born in Florence around the beginning of the 16th century. The exact date is variously given as the end of the 15th century, , , and . His brother Paolo Animuccia was also a celebrated composer. However, little is known about their training and work during this period. Giovanni&#x27;s first and second book of madrigals show similarities with, and may have been modeled on, the music of his slightly older contemporary Francesco Corteccia, court composer to Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. Animuccia and Corteccia were the only significant composers writing madrigals in Florence at the time and both composers published books of madrigals around 1547. (Animuccia&#x27;s &quot;—&quot;Madrigals and Motets for Four and Five Voices&quot;—was published at Venice in 1548.) Animuccia&#x27;s name is also mentioned in association with Florentine literary circles, suggesting that he was involved with cultural life in Florence. Animuccia&#x27;s second book of madrigals was published in 1551 after his arrival in Rome.

==Rome==
After his arrival in Rome in 1550, Animuccia was employed by Cardinal Guido Ascanio Sforza. Early on, through his association with Florentine circles (in particular the exiled Altoviti family), Animuccia met his fellow Florentine St Phillip Neri.

===Music for the oratory===
St Phillip Neri founded a religious congregation called the Oratory. The Oratory began in the early 1550s as small and informal meetings for religious discussion and prayer; these meetings soon began to attract large numbers of people. In 1558, when Phillip obtained a larger room to hold the meetings in, the practice of singing of &quot;laudi spirituali&quot; was introduced. Singing &quot;laudi&quot; was a popular practice in Florence following the legacy of Girolamo Savonarola who strongly encouraged its use, and it is natural therefore that Phillip would incorporate this practice into his meetings. Although the precise date is unknown, Animuccia was involved with music for these meetings from early on and remained &quot;&quot; of the Oratory until his death. Neri was so pleased with Animuccia that he said he had &quot;seen [his] soul... fly upwards towards heaven&quot;. The Oratory was able to attract many musicians who volunteered their services; this included the famous singer Francesco Soto de Langa from the Capella Sistina, the composer Palestrina, and probably the composer Tomás Luis de Victoria who lived in the same house as St. Phillip Neri for five years.

Animuccia published two books of &quot;laudi&quot; for use in the Oratory in 1563 and 1570. His work formed the basis of the oratorios that did not descend from the polyphonic Gregorian &quot;Passions&quot;. Animuccia&#x27;s Florentine influence is evident as some of his texts originate from Florence. Stylistically the two books are rather different. Animuccia&#x27;s first book contains simple settings of Italian &quot;laudi&quot; which are homophonic throughout, and were probably sung by amateur singers as part of Phillip Neri&#x27;s early devotional meetings. The music in Animuccia&#x27;s second book of &quot;laudi&quot; is much more madrigal-like; he uses a greater variety of textures, sonorities, and languages (Latin and Italian). His reasons for the change in style are stated in his dedication:

The oratory having increased, by the grace of God, with the coming together of prelates and of most important gentlemen, it seemed to me fitting in this second book to increase the harmony and the combination of parts, varying the music in diverse ways, now setting it to Latin words and now to the vernacular, sometimes with a greater number of voices and sometimes with fewer, with verses now of one kind and now of another, concerning myself as little as possible with imitations and complexities, in order not to obscure the understanding of the words.

By this time, the number of people attending the Oratory had increased significantly, and Animuccia wished to offer more complex music to &quot;woo influential people through music into churches.&quot;

==Effects of the Counter-Reformation on Animuccia&#x27;s music==
Animuccia was employed as the &#x27; of the Capella Giulia at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on the Vatican from January 1555, following Palestrina&#x27;s promotion by Pope Julius III to the Capella Sistina. Animuccia&#x27;s most important composition for this period was his &#x27; (; 1567). The importance of this book of Masses is due to the fact that its style of composition was directly affected by the liturgical reforms that took place at the Council of Trent through the influence of the Reform Commission in Rome. He held the office until his death at Rome in 1571, succeeded by Palestrina who was his friend and probably his pupil.

===The Council of Trent and the Reform Commission===
The final session of the Council of Trent closed in 1563. One of the primary concerns of the council in its latter stages was the reform of the liturgy, in particular the reform of ‘abuses of the Mass’. To carry out the Council&#x27;s recommendations in Rome, a Reform Commission was set up, headed up by Cardinals Carlo Borromeo and Vitellozzo Vitelli. The main issues that Cardinals Borromeo and Vitelli sought to address regarding music were ‘intelligibility’ (i.e., that Masses should be composed so words could be clearly understood) and the use of secular music in Mass settings. In 1565, the diary of the papal chapel choir recorded that Cardinal Vitelli requested that the choir assemble at his house for a private test of some Mass settings to see whether the words could be understood.

===Animuccia&#x27;s response===
Animuccia, as &#x27; of the Capella Giulia, would no doubt have been aware of this test; it is unsurprising therefore that in 1566 there is a record of him being paid &quot;for the composition of five masses [written] according to the requirements of the Council [of Trent].&quot; Animuccia&#x27;s &#x27; was published at Rome a year later. In his dedication he writes:

...I have sought to adorn these divine praises of God in such a way that the music may disturb the hearing of the text as little as possible, but nevertheless in such a way that it may not be entirely devoid of artifice and may contribute in some measure to the listener&#x27;s pleasure.

All the Masses are freely composed plainsong paraphrases - which fulfills the requirement of the eradication of secular influences. Animuccia&#x27;s presentation of an ‘intelligible’ style is only evident in the Gloria and the Credo, and even here he seems reluctant to strip all ‘artifice’ from the music. Instead he alternates homophonic phrases with polyphonic phrases. In his book of Masses Animuccia is consciously trying to compose music that reconciles, as he sees it, the two polarities in this issue of composing ‘intelligible’ music: that of making the text audible, yet at the same time sounding beautiful – therefore fulfilling the music&#x27;s most important function of drawing the listener deeper into prayer and closer to God. Other significant stylistic features of Animuccia&#x27;s composition style include variations in vocal textures and color by varying voice groupings, and instances of word painting.

Other works composed by Animuccia in this period include some &quot;madrigali spirituali&quot; (1565) and a collection of hymns, motets, Masses and Magnificats (1568).

==Legacy==
The stylistic features described in Animuccia&#x27;s masses and &quot;laudi&quot; can be seen as antecedent to the way choral music would develop from the end of the 16th century into the 17th century. In particular his use of different voice groupings can be seen as a very early example of the polychoral technique (&quot;&quot;) which became very popular in Rome shortly after Animuccia&#x27;s death. Although Animuccia&#x27;s contribution to liturgical musical at this time was soon eclipsed by choral works of his contemporaries Palestrina and Victoria, his music remains an important example as to one of the ways in which a composer sought to deal with the issues which arose after the Council of Trent. As well as this, his significant contribution to the early musical life of the Oratory set precedence for future developments of music written for this setting, which would eventually include the development of the oratorio.

<text>Ánir , also Ánirnar (Danish: Åerne) is a village in the Faroe Islands on the northern island of Borðoy. In 2007 it had a population of 16, but with the expansion of the area with the new apartments above the old settlement the population has increased to 55 in 2013.

== General ==
Ánir lies about 3 km north of the northern isles&#x27; capital Klaksvík on the west coast of Borðoy and was founded in 1840, as the increasing population demanded more land for cultivation. Facing the village is the southern tip of the island of Kunoy. The road through Ánir continues to Strond and then crosses the causeway to the island of Kunoy to continue to the villages of Haraldssund and Kunoy. High over Ánir is the entrance of a road tunnel to Árnafjørður and on to the island of Viðoy.

As of 1 January 2007 Ánir had 16 inhabitants, in 2013 it had 55 inhabitants. Its Postal Code is FO-726. It belongs to the Municipality of Klaksvík. There are two streets: the four houses of the original village are at the main road to Kunoy (Ánavegur) and 15 modern villas have been built in 2009 at a new road called Edmundstrøð (N° 1–28).

The Faroese word &quot;ánir&quot; is a rare variant of &quot;vánir&quot; and means &#x27;forecasts, prospects, hopes&#x27;.

== Swallowed by Klaksvík? ==
The old settlement of Ánir consists of just the small cluster of houses shown in the images in this article. This tranquil and more or less picturesque aspect of Ánir was lost when in 2005 the new freight harbour of Klaksvík (also called the Ánir Cargo Terminal or &quot;Norðhavnin&quot;) was built right in front of the settlement. This harbour has 200 metres of quayside, 12 m deep, with 30,000 sqm of storage area for containers, a cold storage facility and a 30 m wide roll-on/roll-off ramp. Additionally, a real estate development involving the construction of 15 modern villas on Edmundstrøð at Ánir&#x27;s entrance has affected the visual aspect of the village. It could be argued that Ánir has been sacrificed for the growth of Klaksvík and has become part of Klaksvík&#x27;s outskirts. Today the &quot;old Ánir&quot; looks half-abandoned and out of place in its current setting, with broken down cars parked haphazardly and rubbish lying around. There are no shops or other facilities.

The extension of Klaksvík&#x27;s port in recent years is a direct consequence of the opening in 2006 of a sub-sea road tunnel between Borðoy and the Faroe&#x27;s main islands. This tunnel has generated new economic opportunities for Klaksvík.
The Port of Klaksvík recently signed a contract with Smyril Line on the use of Ánir as an alternative terminal for the ferry &quot;Norröna&quot;.

<text>The is a twin-engine aircraft used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. A prototype first flew in May 1941. The first full production variant of the &quot;Gekkō&quot;, the J1N1-C was a reconnaissance aircraft, although many of these underwent field modification into night fighters; in addition, a night fighter variant, the J1N1-S was later put into production. Towards the end of the war, J1N1 pilots also undertook &quot;kamikaze&quot; anti-shipping missions. The &quot;Gekkō&quot; was given the Allied reporting name &quot;Irving&quot;.

==Design and development==
In mid-1938 the Japanese Imperial Navy requested a twin-engine fighter designed to escort the principal bomber used at the time, Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot;. The operating range of the standard Navy fighter, the Mitsubishi A5M &quot;Claude&quot;, was only 1,200 km (750 mi), insufficient compared with the 4,400 km (2,730 mi) of the G3M. Moreover, at the time, the potential of the &quot;Zero&quot;, then still under development, remained to be evaluated, stressing the need for a long-range escort fighter, much as the Luftwaffe had done with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 &quot;Zerstörer&quot;, introduced the year before.

In March 1939, Mitsubishi and Nakajima began the development of a project &quot;13-Shi&quot;. The prototype left the factory in March 1941 equipped with two 843 kW (1,130 hp) Nakajima Sakae 21/22, 14-cylinder radial engines. There was a crew of three, and the aircraft was armed with a 20 mm Type 99 cannon and six 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 97 aircraft machine guns. Four of these machine guns were mounted in two rear-mounted powered turrets. The plane was considered to be overweight, and problems developed with the gearboxes of the propellers, hydraulic system, and ailerons. The turrets were heavy and difficult to bring onto target. In addition, the plane was not considered to be maneuverable enough. These issues brought about the end of the development for a long range fighter. Instead, production was authorized for a lighter reconnaissance variant, the J1N1-C, also known by the Navy designation Navy Type 2 Reconnaissance Plane, which passed flight tests in July, 1942. The J1N1-C had all of its armament removed except for a single 13 mm Type 2 machine-gun at the rear of the cockpit, a reconfigured fuselage, reduced fuel supply (1700 liter down from 2270 liters), and the engines changed from a combination of Sakae-21 and Sakae-22 to just the Sakae-22 without a gearbox. As the need for specialized planes wasn&#x27;t as urgent as standard types, production of the J1N1-C was slow. 54 J1N1-Cs, including prototypes, were produced by Nakajima from April 1942 to March 1943. The J1N1-C was redesignated as the J1N1-R (C for carrier-based, R for reconnaissance), and a few were fitted with a 20mm Type 99 gun in a turret behind the cockpit.

One early variant, the J1N1-F, had a spherical turret with one 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannon mounted immediately behind the pilot.

==Operational history==
In early 1943, Commander Yasuna Kozono () of the 251st Kōkūtai in Rabaul came up with the idea of installing 20 mm cannons, firing upwards at a 30-degree angle in the fuselage. Against orders of central command, which was skeptical of his idea, he tested his idea on a J1N1-C as a night fighter. The field-modified J1N1-C KAI shot down two B-17s of 43rd Bomb Group attacking air bases around Rabaul on 21 May 1943.

The Navy took immediate notice and placed orders with Nakajima for the newly designated J1N1-S nightfighter design. This model was christened the Model 11 &quot;Gekkō&quot; (, &quot;Moonlight&quot;). It had a crew of two, eliminating the navigator position. Like the KAI, it had twin 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannon firing upward in a 30° upward angle, but added a second pair firing downward at a forward 30° angle, allowing attacks from above or below. Production was quickly ramped up, with 183 produced between April 1943 and March 1944, and a further 204 produced before end of production in December 1944. This arrangement was effective against B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and B-24 Liberators, which usually had Sperry ball turrets for ventral defense. The &quot;Gekkō&#x27;s&quot; existence was not quickly understood by the Allies, who assumed the Japanese did not have the technology for night fighter designs. Some planes were equipped with the Type 3 Mk. 6 Model 4 radar in the nose to detect enemy ships at night, while others were equipped with a searchlight in place of the radar. Later models, the J1N1-Sa, omitted the two downward-firing guns and added another 20 mm cannon to face upward as with the other two. Other variants without nose antennae or searchlight added a 20 mm cannon to the nose.

The J1N1-S was used against B-29 Superfortresses in Japan, though the lack of good radar and insufficient high-altitude performance handicapped it since, usually, only one pass could be made against the higher-speed B-29s. However, some skillful pilots had spectacular successes, such as Lieutenant Sachio Endo, who was credited with destroying eight B-29s and damaging another eight before he was shot down by a B-29 crew, Shigetoshi Kudo (nine victories), Shiro Kurotori (six victories), and Juzo Kuramoto (eight victories); the last two claimed five B-29s during the night of 25–26 May 1945. Another &quot;Gekkō&quot; crew shot down five B-29&#x27;s in one night, but these successes were rare. Many &quot;Gekkō&#x27;s&quot; were also shot down or destroyed on the ground.

==Variants==

* J1N1 : Three seaters long-range fighter. Two of prototypes and seven of supplementary prototypes.
* J1N1 KAI : Night Fighter converted from J1N1.
* J1N1-C : Long-range reconnaissance aircraft. Later re-designated J1N1-R.
* J1N1-C KAI : Night Fighter converted from J1N1-C.
* J1N1-R : Long-range reconnaissance aircraft.
* J1N1-F : Observation aircraft. A little number of prototypes only. Equipped G5N2 turret or G4M2 turret.
* J1N1-S : Night fighter aircraft. Armed with 2 × 20 mm forward up-firing Type 99 cannons and 2 × 20 mm forward under-firing Type 99 cannons.
* J1N1-Sa : Night Fighter same as above, armed with 3 × 20 mm forward up-firing Type 99 cannons.

==Surviving aircraft==
Only one J1N1-S &quot;Gekkō&quot; survives today. Following the occupation of the home islands, U.S. forces gathered 145 interesting Japanese aircraft and sent them to the United States aboard three aircraft carriers. Four &quot;Gekkō&#x27;s&quot; were in this group: three captured at Atsugi and one from Yokosuka. Serial Number 7334, the aircraft from Yokosuka, was given Foreign Equipment number FE 3031 (later changed to T2-N700). Records show that after arriving aboard the , air intelligence officials assigned &quot;Gekkō 7334&quot; to Langley Field, Virginia, on 8 December 1945. The airplane was moved to the Air Materiel Depot at Middletown, Pennsylvania, on 23 January 1946.

The Maintenance Division at Middletown prepared the &quot;Gekkō&quot; for flight tests, overhauling the plane&#x27;s engines (the same make/model as the Zero had used) and replacing the oxygen system, radios, and some flight instruments with American equipment. Mechanics completed this work by 9 April. The Navy transferred &quot;Gekkō 7334&quot; to the Army in early June, and an army pilot flew the &quot;Gekkō&quot; on 15 June 1946, for about 35 minutes. At least one other test flight took place before the Army Air Forces flew the fighter to an empty former Douglas C-54 factory at Park Ridge, Illinois, for storage. The remaining three &quot;Gekkōs&quot; were scrapped.

In 1949, the &quot;Gekkō&quot; was given to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air Museum, but remained in storage at Park Ridge, Illinois. The collection of museum aircraft at Park Ridge numbered more than 60 airplanes when the war in Korea forced the United States Air Force to move it to the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland. &quot;Gekkō 7334&quot; was dumped outside the restoration facility in a large shipping crate in 1953 where it remained until building space became available in 1974. In 1979, NASM staff selected &quot;Gekkō 7334&quot; for restoration.

Following restoration of the museum&#x27;s Mitsubishi Zero in 1976, the &quot;Gekkō&quot; became the second Japanese aircraft to be restored by NASM. The airframe was found to be seriously corroded from being outside for twenty years. At that time, it was the largest and most complex aircraft restoration project the NASM had undertaken. Work started on 7 September 1979, and ended 14 December 1983, following 17,000 hours of work. Today, &quot;Gekkō 7334&quot; is fully restored and on display in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, US.

<doc id="1131639" wikidata="Q7622031" url="?curid=1131639" title="Strathbungo">
<text>Strathbungo is a mainly residential area of southern Glasgow, Scotland, bordered by the neighbourhoods of Crossmyloof to the south, Govanhill to the east and Pollokshields to the north and west. The settlement grew up as a small isolated village built along the Pollokshaws Road, one of the main arteries leading southwards from the centre of Glasgow (today part of the A77 road), adjoined by the Camphill Estate, now part of Queens Park. Strathbungo lay just inside Govan parish, on its boundary with Cathcart parish, and at one time a line just north of Allison Street and Nithsdale Street formed the boundary or &#x27;march&#x27; between the counties of Lanark and Renfrew.

The feudal superiors, the Maxwells of Pollok, preferred the name Marchtown. This name is seen on some old maps, and survives in March Street.

==Etymology==
The words &#x27;Strathbungo Cross&#x27; appear on a tenement at the corner of Allison Street and Pollokshaws Road, but no satisfactory explanation has ever been given for the name Strathbungo, as &#x27;Strath&#x27; (from Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Srath&quot;) is normally a prefix for a wide river valley. However, there is no river Bungo. &quot;Bungo&quot; may represent a de-nasalisation of Mungo, the patron saint of Glasgow, from &quot;Srath Mhungain&quot;.

==Development==
Strathbungo developed as a crofters and miners village in the early 18th century. By the end of that century, over 35 families were living in the village and weaving had become the principal occupation.

1859 and 1860 are the dates of the feuing dispositions granted by Sir John Maxwell of Pollok to the builder John McIntyre and quarrier William Stevenson for the development of the new Strathbungo. 1-10 Moray Place was the first block to be built in the new Strathbungo, to the designs of Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson that set the path for Strathbungo to develop as a residential suburb of Glasgow, linked by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway. Thomson lived in the house that he designed at No 1 Moray Place and died there in 1875. The other terraces (named, as was Moray Place, after the protagonists in the Battle of Langside fought nearby), Regent Park Square, Queen Square and Princes Square (later renamed Marywood Square), were built from 1862 to 1880, to form a desirable residential suburb. In the 1890s, the first winner of the posthumous Alexander Thomson Medal, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, lived at 27 Regent Park Square. Strathbungo was later extended in 1928–9 to include the red sandstone terraces of Vennard, Thorncliffe and Carswell Gardens. Strathbungo was designated a conservation area in 1973, although the Gardens were later removed and the area extended to include Nithsdale Street and Drive.

In Alexander Thomson&#x27;s death notice published in the&quot; Glasgow Herald&quot; of 23 March 1875, his place of death is described as &quot;1, Moray Place, Regent Park&quot; with no reference to Strathbungo; the residential suburb was initially styled Regent Park, although the area was always more widely known as Strathbungo.

By the 1860s tenement buildings had started to appear, and the last of the original village buildings were lost in the 1890s. The village never achieved burgh status and was annexed to Glasgow in 1891.

Strathbungo railway station opened on 1 December 1877, and closed on 28 May 1962.

==Conservation==
The Strathbungo Society helps promote the preservation of the Strathbungo Conservation Area and organises events for local people like &#x27;Bungo at the Bells&#x27; at the New Year and the &#x27;Bungo in the Back Lanes&#x27; event in June each year which was originally set up to help get people into the lanes in Strathbungo and to highlight the need for the refurbishment of them.

<text>Argir () is a village in the Faroe Islands.

Argir most likely takes its name from Old Irish airge, which means &quot;summer pasture&quot;.; several placenames in Faroe carry the same name with this meaning. Once a village south of Tórshavn, Argir has grown and merged with Tórshavn. In 1997, it joined the municipality of Tórshavn.

In recent years, more houses have been built in Argir, and the village, or quarter, has grown upwards into the hills. This area has views over the sea and the capital.

There is a boat harbour with boathouses in Argir and a church built in 1974.

From the 16th century until 1750, there was a leprosy-hospital in Argir. Some paupers lived there, too. When the hospital closed, the building became a workhouse for the poor. On 9 May 1828, Andreas Mortensen (1794-1875) bought Argir in an auction for 1005 &quot;ríkis dálar.&quot; He moved there with his family and lived there until he died; his descendants have been a big part of the town&#x27;s history, and a memorial stone was raised on 9 May 1948 in his honour.

Argir&#x27;s football team is called AB (Argja Bóltfelag). It has a rowing club called Argja Róðrarfelag. Its boats are red and have a dragon head on the prow.

<doc id="1131644" wikidata="Q7980191" url="?curid=1131644" title="Weil pairing">
<text>In mathematics, the Weil pairing is a pairing (bilinear form, though with multiplicative notation) on the points of order dividing &quot;n&quot; of an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot;, taking values in &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity. More generally there is a similar Weil pairing between points of order &quot;n&quot; of an abelian variety and its dual. It was introduced by André Weil (1940) for Jacobians of curves, who gave an abstract algebraic definition; the corresponding results for elliptic functions were known, and can be expressed simply by use of the Weierstrass sigma function.

==Formulation==
Choose an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; defined over a field &quot;K&quot;, and an integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 (we require &quot;n&quot; to be coprime to char(&quot;K&quot;) if char(&quot;K&quot;) &gt; 0) such that &quot;K&quot; contains a primitive nth root of unity. Then the &quot;n&quot;-torsion on formula_1 is known to be a Cartesian product of two cyclic groups of order &quot;n&quot;. The Weil pairing produces an &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity

:formula_2

by means of Kummer theory, for any two points formula_3, where formula_4 and formula_5.

A down-to-earth construction of the Weil pairing is as follows. Choose a function &quot;F&quot; in the function field of &quot;E&quot; over the algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot; with divisor

:formula_6

So &quot;F&quot; has a simple zero at each point &quot;P&quot; + &quot;kQ&quot;, and a simple pole at each point &quot;kQ&quot; if these points are all distinct. Then &quot;F&quot; is well-defined up to multiplication by a constant. If &quot;G&quot; is the translation of &quot;F&quot; by &quot;Q&quot;, then by construction &quot;G&quot; has the same divisor, so the function &quot;G/F&quot; is constant.

Therefore if we define

:formula_7

we shall have an &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity (as translating &quot;n&quot; times must give 1) other than 1. With this definition it can be shown that &quot;w&quot; is alternating and bilinear, giving rise to a non-degenerate pairing on the &quot;n&quot;-torsion.

The Weil pairing does not extend to a pairing on all the torsion points (the direct limit of &quot;n&quot;-torsion points) because the pairings for different &quot;n&quot; are not the same. However
they do fit together to give a pairing &quot;T&quot;ℓ(&quot;E&quot;) × &quot;T&quot;ℓ(&quot;E&quot;) → &quot;T&quot;ℓ(μ) on the Tate module &quot;T&quot;ℓ(&quot;E&quot;) of the elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; (the inverse limit of the ℓ&quot;n&quot;-torsion points) to the Tate module &quot;T&quot;ℓ(μ) of the multiplicative group (the inverse limit of ℓ&quot;n&quot; roots of unity).

==Generalisation to abelian varieties==
For abelian varieties over an algebraically closed field &quot;K&quot;, the Weil pairing is a nondegenerate pairing

:formula_8

for all &quot;n&quot; prime to the characteristic of &quot; K&quot;. Here formula_9 denotes the dual abelian variety of &quot;A&quot;. This is the so-called &quot;Weil pairing&quot; for higher dimensions. If &quot;A&quot; is equipped with a polarisation

:formula_10,
then composition gives a (possibly degenerate) pairing

:formula_11

If &quot;C&quot; is a projective, nonsingular curve of genus ≥ 0 over &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;J&quot; its Jacobian, then the theta-divisor of &quot;J&quot; induces a principal polarisation of &quot;J&quot;, which in this particular case happens to be an isomorphism (see autoduality of Jacobians). Hence, composing the Weil pairing for &quot;J&quot; with the polarisation gives a nondegenerate pairing

:formula_12

for all &quot;n&quot; prime to the characteristic of &quot;k&quot;.

As in the case of elliptic curves, explicit formulae for this pairing can be given in terms of divisors of &quot;C&quot;.

==Applications==

The pairing is used in number theory and algebraic geometry, and has also been applied in elliptic curve cryptography and identity based encryption.

<text>Otway Burns (c. 1775 – August 25, 1850) was an American privateer during the War of 1812 and later, a North Carolina State Senator.

==Early life==
Burns was born at Queen&#x27;s Creek, near Swansboro, North Carolina. He became a seaman after learning the trade at the ports in Swansboro and Beaufort, a nearby town situated in Carteret County. After acquiring the skills needed to become a merchant captain, Burns sailed along the East Coast of the United States, all the way north up to Maine. After his voyage, he married his cousin, Joanna Grant, on July 6, 1809. The next year, the couple moved to Swansboro. There, Joanna gave birth to Owen, the couple&#x27;s only child.

Burns received financial support for his trading activities from Edward Pasteur, a physician and local political leader from New Bern. In the summer of 1812, just a month after the War of 1812 had commenced, Burns and Pasteur purchased a vessel in New York City for eight thousand US dollars, which Burns intended to use for privateering along the coast of The Carolinas. The 147-ton vessel, named &quot;Zephyr&quot;, had been constructed four years earlier on the West River in Maryland. &quot;Zephyr&quot; measured from bow (ship) to stern, had a beam of and a depth of almost . The vessel was armed with one pivot gun and between five and seven gun carriages. Also on board were a number of small arms: cutlasses, pistols, muskets, boarding pikes, pickaxes and blunderbusses. After rechristening the vessel as &quot;Snap Dragon&quot;, Burns and Pasteur obtained official letters of marque for the vessel in New York on August 27, 1812. After sailing back to New Bern, the men sold their 50 shares in the ship at a price of US$260 per share to eight other investors from New Bern, Tarboro and Edenton.

==Privateering career==
Pasteur and Burns, on &quot;Snap Dragon&quot;, headed to New Bern to recruit men to join the vessel&#x27;s crew. To their surprise, some of New Bern&#x27;s political leaders treated privateering like piracy, and they tried to complicate matters for the two privateers. The leaders convinced new recruits to borrow money, upon which, they would be arrested for their debt. Burns twice retaliated against the politicians. In one incident, the crew of &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; sank a boat with constables who were planning on boarding the ship. Subsequently, a local attorney labeled the vessel as a &quot;licensed robber&quot;. Burns responded by rowing to land and throwing the lawyer into a river.

With a 25-man crew, Burns left New Bern for Norfolk, Virginia. On October 14, 1812, &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; and another vessel, &quot;Revenge&quot;, sailed south. The vessels separated a week later.

&quot;Snap Dragon&quot; encountered success early in the cruise. In one situation, she outran a British frigate and sloop. A few days later, &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; captured its first prize, a British merchant ship armed with 14 guns. Soon after, Burns and Pasteur led the vessel to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. To fool enemy British ships, they disguised &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; as a merchant ship by putting up old, ragged sails and moving the guns out of view. &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; ran into five British men of war. One of the ships, the frigate , fired a warning shot and signaled the other ships to chase down &quot;Snap Dragon&quot;. For over two hours, Burns led &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; away from danger, toward Ship Rock passage, which unknowingly, was blocked by two British brigs. immediately launched an attack on &quot;Snap Dragon&quot;. Burns told his crew to lie down on the deck while the vessel was being fired upon. Burns was able to escape from the British ships unscathed. The next morning, Burns and his crew encountered , another British man of war, but again they successfully escaped. The crew of &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; made their way to St. Croix, where they made &quot;several small captures&quot; of coastal traders.

Burns commanded &quot;Snap Dragon&quot; on her next two cruises, during which he had several encounters with British men-of-war and took numerous prizes.

==Life after privateering==

Months before he completed his third cruise in 1814, Burns&#x27;s wife Joanna and son Owen left him to live with relatives in Jones County. In September, Joanna died, leaving her son in the custody of her family for five years before Burns obtained legal guardianship over Owen.

Three months later, Burns married Jane Hall, a 20-year-old from Beaufort, North Carolina. In April 1815, Burns purchased a property in Beaufort, on which he built a house, that would be his family&#x27;s residence for the next 20 years.

===Business===

From the wealth he gained from privateering, Burns became a shipbuilder at Swansboro, North Carolina, and made investments in local businesses. In 1818, he built &quot;Prometheus&quot; at his shipyard in Swansboro near the mouth of the White Oak River (NC Historical Marker #54), the first steamboat in North Carolina, which operated on the Cape Fear River. In 1823, he built &quot;Warrior&quot; in Beaufort, followed by the brig &quot;Henry&quot;, eight years later.

During much of the 1820s, he managed a store and taproom on his Beaufort property, and also had a partnership in a Taylor&#x27;s Creek salt distribution company. Burns possessed a number of vessels, such as a schooner, seiner, sailboat and a mullet boat. Among other things, he also co-owned brick kilns used by the federal government to build Fort Macon, in the largest public works project in the history of the area, and enslaved 11 people, whose forced labor was used for his businesses and on his plantation in Carteret County.

===Political career===
Burns&#x27;s political career started with his 1821 election to represent Carteret County in the North Carolina House of Commons and his appointment to serve as the commissioner of a local canal connecting Neuse and Newport Rivers. He served 11 terms in the legislature—seven in the House of Representatives and four in the Senate—over a course of 14 years.

===Later life===
In 1835 President Andrew Jackson appointed him keeper of the Brant Island Shoal Light, a position he held until his death. He is buried in the Old Burying Ground at Beaufort.

==Honors==
Two destroyers have been named in his honor: and , in service during World War I and II, respectively. In 1834, Burnsville, North Carolina was founded and named in his honor. A statue of him was placed in the town square in 1909. The town of Otway, in Carteret County, North Carolina, is also named for him. He has descendants living today in the areas of Beaufort, Swansboro and Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, and in the immediate area of his birth near Queens Creek, North Carolina.

Captain Burns&#x27;s life is the basis of a historical novel by Ruth P. Barbour, &quot;The Cruise of the Snap Dragon.&quot;

<doc id="1131652" wikidata="Q2595966" url="?curid=1131652" title="No pain, no gain">
<text>No pain, no gain (or &quot;No gain without pain&quot;) is a proverb, used since the 1980s as an exercise motto that promises greater value rewards for the price of hard and even painful work. Under this conception competitive professionals, such as athletes and artists, are required to endure pain (physical suffering) and stress (mental/emotional suffering) to achieve professional excellence. Medical experts agree that the proverb is mostly ineffective for exercise.

==Exercise motto==

It came into prominence after 1982 when actress Jane Fonda began to produce a series of aerobics workout videos. In these videos, Fonda would use &quot;No pain, no gain&quot; and &quot;Feel the burn&quot; as catchphrases for the concept of working out past the point of experiencing muscle aches.

It expresses the belief that solid large muscle is the result of training hard. Delayed onset muscle soreness is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of a workout.

In terms of the expression used for development, the discomfort caused may be beneficial in some instances while detrimental in others. Detrimental pain can include joint pain. Beneficial pain usually refers to that resulting from tearing microscopic muscle fibers, which will be rebuilt more densely, making a bigger muscle.

The expression has been adopted in a variety of sports and fitness activities, beginning in 1982 to present day.

David B. Morris wrote in &quot;The Scientist&quot; in 2005, &quot;&#x27;No pain, no gain&#x27; is an American modern mini-narrative: it compresses the story of a protagonist who understands that the road to achievement runs only through hardship.&quot; The concept has been described as being a modern form of Puritanism.

==Origin==
The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (c. 750-650 BC) expresses this idea in &quot;Works and Days&quot; where he wrote:

The ancient Greek playwright Sophocles (5th Century BC) expresses this idea in the play &quot;Electra&quot; (line 945). This line is translated as: &quot;nothing truly succeeds without pain&quot;, &quot;nothing succeeds without toil&quot;, &quot;there is no success without hard work&quot;, and &quot;Without labour nothing prospers (well).&quot;

A form of this expression is found in the beginning of the second century, written in &quot;The Ethics of the Fathers&quot; 5:23 (known in Hebrew as &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot;), which quotes Ben Hei Hei as saying, &quot;According to the pain is the reward.&quot; This is interpreted to be a spiritual lesson; without the pain in doing what God commands, there is no spiritual gain.
In 1577 British poet Nicholas Breton wrote: &quot;They must take pain that look for any gain.&quot;

One of the earliest attestations of the phrase comes from the poet Robert Herrick in his &quot;Hesperides&quot;. In the 1650 edition, a two-line poem was added:

A version of the phrase was crafted by Benjamin Franklin, in his persona of Poor Richard (1734), to illustrate the axiom &quot;God helps those who help themselves&quot;:

In the phrase, Franklin&#x27;s central thesis was that everyone should exercise 45 minutes each day.  

In 1853 R. C. Trench wrote in &quot;On Lessons in Proverbs&quot; iv: &quot;For the most part they courageously accept the law of labour, No pains, no gains,—No sweat, no sweet, as the appointed law and condition of man&#x27;s life.&quot;

In 1859 Samuel Smiles included “No pains no gains” in a list of proverbs about the secret to making money in Self-Help (book).

<doc id="1131655" wikidata="Q5136616" url="?curid=1131655" title="Clunch">
<text>Clunch is a traditional building material of chalky limestone rock used mainly in eastern England and Normandy. Clunch distinguishes itself from archetypal forms of limestone by being softer in character when cut, and may resemble chalk in lower density, or with minor clay-like components.

==Use==
Clunch has been used in a wide variety of shapes such as irregular lumps picked from the topsoil of certain fields, or more commonly blocks quarried by being cut from the bedrock in regular-shaped (ashlar) building blocks. If in the first form it can be bedded in a ramshackle manner (as rubble masonry); if in the second then laid in courses. In either case, mortar is often used between stones to form walls.

==Properties==
The stone is a chalk from the Lower Chalk of the Cretaceous age, the period of geological time approximately 145–66 million years ago. It is greyish-white to light beige in colour, often with a greenish tinge. The latter is caused by the presence of glauconite, the potassium and iron aluminium silicate mineral that is also found in Kentish Ragstone. The stone has a gritty texture because of the frequent presence of shell fossils. This stone has been quarried at Totternhoe Quarry in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, by H. G. Clarke &amp; Son since 1920.

It is particularly soft when quarried and subject to chemical and wind erosion as exposed material, i.e. when unrendered in paint, stucco or cement. It can be cut by a saw when in its softer state; when it has been quarried out of the ground it still contains a large amount of water. When the stone dries out it becomes harder, and is not as easy to cut.

Clunch is generically a soft limestone. It can be rich in iron-bearing clays or be very fine and white – in effect just chalk. It is used in various parts of East Anglia, where more durable stone is uncommon, and can be seen frequently in and around Thetford – mostly now for property boundary walls as it is not a long-lasting material, but it is also used for some building walls, especially in traditional agricultural buildings.

In Ely Cathedral it can be seen in some interior locations. The nearby village of Burwell has its civil parish magazine named after the building material. It is found in the village of Seale in Surrey and in Farnham.

==Inferior meaning==
The term has been sometimes used more generically, in other parts of England for any soft and aggregate-based vernacular building stone that has been used as a cheaper, inferior substitute for stronger stone.

<text>Virginia Anna Adeleid Weidler (March 21, 1927 – July 1, 1968) was an American child actress, popular in Hollywood films during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Early life and career==
Weidler was born on March 21, 1927, in the Eagle Rock area of Los Angeles, California, the youngest of six children born to German parents, Alfred Weidler, an architect, and Margaret Weidler (born Margarete Therese Louise Radon, 1890–1987), a former opera singer. She was the second Weidler child born in the United States after the family emigrated from Germany in 1923.

She made her first film appearance in 1931. Her first credited role was as Europena in &quot;Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch&quot; (1934), a role she won at age seven after having been seen in the play &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot;. Virginia made a big impression on audiences as the little girl who would &quot;hold my breath &#x27;til I am black in the face&quot; to get her way.

For the next several years, she appeared in many memorable films from George Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Laddie&quot; (1935) to a pivotal supporting role in &quot;Souls at Sea&quot; (1938) starring Gary Cooper and George Raft. Despite being under contract to Paramount, many of her roles of the period took place while on loan to RKO-Radio Pictures.

When Paramount did not extend her contract, she was signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Her first film for MGM was with its leading male star Mickey Rooney in &quot;Love Is a Headache&quot; (1938). The film was a success and Weidler was later cast in larger roles. She was one of the all-female cast of the 1939 film &quot;The Women&quot;, as the daughter of Norma Shearer&#x27;s character.
Her next major success was &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940) in which she played Dinah Lord, the witty younger sister of Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) and performed the song &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot;. Her film career ended with the 1943 film &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;.

At her retirement from the screen at age 16, she had appeared in more than 40 films, and had acted with some of the biggest stars of the day, including Clark Gable and Myrna Loy in &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;, Bette Davis in &quot;All This and Heaven Too&quot;, and Judy Garland in &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot;.
==Family==

Virginia had three brothers and two sisters. Her brothers Warner (born Werner), Walter (born Wolfgang), and George were successful musicians after some child-acting work, eventually owning their own recording studio. George was married to singer-actress Doris Day from 1946–1949 (his first marriage, her second). Her sisters, Sylvia (born Waltraud) and Renee (born Verena), also were involved in show business prior to their marriages.

Her father turned his architectural skills into a career building miniature sets for 20th Century Fox.

==Marriage==
On March 27, 1947, aged 20, Weidler married Lionel Krisel. They had two sons. Krisel&#x27;s U.S. Navy career began during WWII; he spent two years in Korea in the early 1950s, and--with his wife and children--was stationed for some time in Cuba in the late 1950s.

==Death==
After her retirement, Weidler gave no interviews for the remainder of her life. She was married to Krisel until her death at age 41 at her Los Angeles home on July 1, 1968. She had suffered from a heart ailment for many years and died of a heart attack.

==Legacy==
While not the box-office draw of Fox&#x27;s Shirley Temple or Jane Withers, Weidler still has a loyal following to this day. In 2012, the Virginia Weidler Remembrance Society was created to honor her life and career.

In late 2016, the Los Angeles City Council honored Weidler by proclaiming March 21, 2017, which would have been her 90th birthday, as A Celebration of Virginia Weidler.

<text>The Greater Manchester County Council (GMCC) was the top-tier local government administrative body for Greater Manchester from 1974 to 1986. A strategic authority, with responsibilities for roads, public transport, planning, emergency services and waste disposal, it was composed of 106 directly elected members drawn from the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester. The Greater Manchester County Council shared power with ten lower-tier district councils, each of which directed local matters. It was also known as the Greater Manchester Council (GMC) and the Greater Manchester Metropolitan County Council (GMMCC).

Established with reference to the Local Government Act 1972, elections in 1973 brought about the county council&#x27;s launch as a shadow authority, several months before Greater Manchester (its zone of influence) was officially created on 1 April 1974. The Greater Manchester County Council operated from its County Hall headquarters on Portland Street in central Manchester, until it was abolished 31 March 1986, following the Local Government Act 1985. Its powers were passed to the ten district councils of Greater Manchester, which had shared power with the GMCC. Some powers of the county council were restored when the district councils delegated strategic responsibilities (such as emergency services and public transport) to the county-wide Association of Greater Manchester Authorities and joint boards.

==History==
===Creation===

The Local Government Act 1972 reformed local government in England by creating a system of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country. The act formally established Greater Manchester as a metropolitan county on 1 April 1974. The first election for the Greater Manchester County Council (GMCC) was held in 1973, operating as a shadow authority alongside the old councils until it formally assumed its powers on 1 April 1974. The leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; on the day the Local Government Act came into effect noted that the &quot;new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively&quot;.

===Operational history===


By January 1974, a joint working party representing Greater Manchester had drawn up its county &quot;Structure Plan&quot;, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out strategic and long-term objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest priority was to increase the quality of life for its inhabitants by way of improving the county&#x27;s physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester&#x27;s basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century industrial growth, and was unsuited to modern communication systems and life-styles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in the county&#x27;s country parks to improve the region&#x27;s poor reputation on leisure and recreational facilities, and to improve the county&#x27;s transport infrastructure and journey to work patterns.

The council built County Hall on Portland Street in Manchester city centre at the cost of £4.5 million (£ as of 2025), which served as its headquarters. The building is now known as Westminster House.

Because of political objection, particularly from Cheshire, Greater Manchester covered only the inner, urban 62 of the 90 former districts that the Royal Commission had outlined as an effective administrative metropolitan area. In this capacity, GMCC found itself &quot;planning for an arbitrary metropolitan area ... abruptly truncated to the south&quot;, and so had to negotiate several land-use, transport and housing projects with its neighbouring county councils. However a &quot;major programme of environmental action&quot; by GMCC broadly succeeded in reversing social deprivation in its inner city slums. Leisure and recreational successes included the Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre (better known as the G-Mex centre and now branded Manchester Central), a converted former railway station in Manchester city centre used for cultural events, and GMCC&#x27;s creation of five new country parks within its boundaries. Greater Manchester Transport was established from the former SELNEC PTE to operate the county&#x27;s public transport.

GMCC was, however, criticised for being too Manchester-centric by representatives from the outer suburbs.

===Abolition===

A decade after they were established, the mostly Labour-controlled metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council (GLC) had several high-profile clashes with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, with regard to overspending and high rates charging. Government policy on the issue was considered throughout 1982, and the Conservative Party put a &quot;promise to scrap the metropolitan county councils&quot; and the GLC, in their manifesto for the 1983 general election. Greater Manchester County Council was abolished on 31 March 1986 under the Local Government Act 1985. That the metropolitan county councils were controlled by the Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: the general secretary of the National Association of Local Government Officers described it as a &quot;completely cynical manoeuvre&quot;. Most of the functions of GMCC were devolved to the ten Greater Manchester metropolitan district councils, though some functions such as emergency services and public transport were taken over by joint boards and continued to be run on a county-wide basis. The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) was established to continue much of the county-wide services of the county council. The metropolitan county continued to exist in law, and as a geographic frame of reference, for example as a NUTS 2 administrative division for statistical purposes within the European Union.

===Aftermath===
Although the metropolitan county council was abolished in 1986, the county area continues to exist, for Parliamentary representation, in mapping, and especially for statistical purposes. The county continues to exist today as both a legal and geographic entity, and has its own Lord Lieutenant (the Monarch&#x27;s representative in a county) and High Sheriff.

The last leader of Greater Manchester County Council, Bernard Clarke, became the manager of the YMCA&#x27;s Training for Life project and a director of Manchester Travel Services and of Manchester&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry. The county council&#x27;s last Chief executive, Tony Harrison, a solicitor, remained Clerk to the Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester after abolition and became a director of various companies. In February 1992, wrongly believing he was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, 61-year-old Harrison committed suicide.

In March 2010, following the active pursuit of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, it was agreed by the government of the United Kingdom and the ten district councils of Greater Manchester that there should be a return to a statutory, two-tiered system of local governance for Greater Manchester. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority was agreed upon to strategically govern Greater Manchester from 1 April 2011. It consists of eleven members: ten indirectly elected members, each a directly elected councillor from one of the ten metropolitan boroughs that comprise Greater Manchester and elected Mayor of Greater Manchester who chairs the Authority. The authority will derive most of its powers from the Local Government Act 2000 and Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009.

==Powers and composition==
The Greater Manchester County Council was a strategic authority running regional services such as public transport, health provision, planning and emergency services. It served to provide a strategic regional framework within which the differing plans of its ten metropolitan borough councils could be harmonised.

Bernard Clarke served as leader of the GMCC.

==Premises==

The county council had its main administrative offices at County Hall, an office building at 11 Portland Street in Manchester, built in 1974. Council meetings were held at Manchester Town Hall. After the council&#x27;s abolition, County Hall was sold to Parc Securities in 1988 for an undisclosed sum, believed to be between £5 and £6 million, and refurbished for offices. County Hall Properties bought the structure from Parc two years later and renamed it Westminster House, alluding to the government that abolished the Greater Manchester County Council; the managing director of County Hall (Manchester) Management, the former GMCC economic development chief and former Parc consultant Leslie Boardman, declined to disclose the purchase price in 1992, but press reports put it at about £22 million. The seven-storey building became used by the Halifax and Chelsea building societies, the AGF and Scottish Amicable insurance companies, and the German consulate.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1986 was held by the following parties:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council were:

===Council elections===
Elections were held to the Greater Manchester County Council three times, in 1973, 1977, and 1981.
Elections were due to be held in 1985 but these were cancelled due to the council&#x27;s impending abolition. Those councillors elected in 1981 had their terms of office extended until the council&#x27;s abolition on 31 March 1986.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms granted by the College of Arms to the Greater Manchester Council are described as:

<doc id="1131666" wikidata="Q1219385" url="?curid=1131666" title="Die schöne Galathée">
<text>(The Beautiful Galatea) is an operetta in one act by Franz von Suppé to a German libretto by the composer and &#x27;Poly Henrion&#x27; (the pseudonym of Leonhard Kohl von Kohlenegg).* 

In the early 1860s, French operettas by Jacques Offenbach were first presented in Vienna. Franz von Suppé was obliged to compete with them by taking the time-honored traditions of Vienna and combining it with the new style of Offenbach. &quot;Die schöne Galathée&quot; was Franz von Suppé&#x27;s first critical success.

==Performance history==
The first performance was at the in Berlin on 30 June 1865, with Anna Grobecker of the Vienna Carltheater as a guest star singing the role of Ganymed. It was given in London at the Opera Comique, on 6 November 1871, and in New York at the Stadt Theater on 6 September 1867.

==Roles and role creators==
*Galathée (Galatea) (soprano) Ämilie Kraft
*Ganymed (Ganymede) (mezzo-soprano) Anna Grobecker
*Mydas (Midas) (baritone) Karl Treumann
*Pygmalion (tenor) Telek

==Synopsis==

The sculptor Pygmalion has fallen madly in love with his statue of Galathée and accordingly does not want to sell it to Mydas, a patron of the arts. Instead he prays to Venus, the goddess of the love, that the statue be brought to life. The wish is granted but Galathée turns out to be a very independent-minded creature. She is unfaithful to Pygmalion with his servant Ganymed (because he is much more pleasing to her than Pygmalion) and does not reject Mydas, who offers her jewelry. When Pygmalion catches Galathée in a compromising situation, he successfully implores Venus to turn her back into stone. The jewelry offered by Mydas is also turned into stone, but the whole statue is sold to him.

<text>The Syria national football team () represents Syria in international football, and is controlled by the Syrian Arab Federation for Football, the governing body for football in Syria. Syria has never qualified for the World Cup finals, but did reach the fourth qualification round in 2018. The team was banned by FIFA from playing at home since December 2010. Internationally, Syria won the 2012 WAFF Championship, 1957 Arab Games, 1987 Mediterranean Games and the 2024 Intercontinental Cup.

== History ==
=== 1936–1969: The beginnings===
The Syrian Football Federation was founded in 1936, 10 years before independence from the French in 1946. It has been affiliated with FIFA since 1937 and has been a member of AFC since 1969. Syria played its first unofficial matches under the name of Damascus XI with Lebanon (5–4) in 1939 and with Iraq (1–2) in 1944.

Syria played their first official game against Lebanon on 19 April 1942; &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; won 2–1. Syria&#x27;s first official qualifying match was played in Ankara against Turkey, which ended in a Syrian defeat 7–0 on 20 November 1949. Thanks to that, the Syrian team participated in the 1950 World Cup European qualifiers as one of the first teams in the region to do so. One of the biggest defeats was played in Athens against Greece, on 25 November 1949, 5 days after its first official match which ended in a score of 8–0 for the Greeks. 

At the 1951 Mediterranean Games in Alexandria, on 12 October 1951, one of Syria&#x27;s biggest defeats was recorded against Egypt which ended with a score of 8–0 for the &quot;Pharaohs&quot;.
The first great success of the national team was silver at the 1953 Arab Games, when they were defeated in the final by Egypt (4–0). At the 1957 Arab Games in Beirut, they advanced to the finals after the semi-final defeat of Morocco, in which they defeated Tunisia with goals scored by Shamas and Awadis Kaoulakian 3–1. 

In the FIFA World Cup 1958 qualifiers, the Syrian football team was defeated by the Sudan in the 1st round of the playoffs. Between 1958 and 1961, the team combined with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic national football team, although the team&#x27;s records are attributed only to Egypt by FIFA. Syria reached the finals in the Arab Cup twice: in 1963 (beaten by Tunisia) and 1966 (beaten by Iraq).

In the 1966 World Cup qualifiers they were one of two teams from the Asian zone (the other being Israel) to be allocated to the European qualifying zone and were originally placed with Spain and the Republic of Ireland. However, they joined the Asian and African boycott of the 1966 qualifiers, due to the decision of FIFA to allocate just one place between Asia and Africa.

===1970s: Successes in Arab competitions===
In the 1970s, they regularly participated in the Palestine Cup, which served as a substitute for the Arab Cup. At the 1972 Palestine Cup, they placed fourth when they lost 1–3 to Algeria. At the 1973 Palestine Cup, they advanced from the group stage to the semifinals, where they eliminated Algeria after penalties (0–0, pen. 3–2). In the final of the cup, they clearly lost to Tunisia 0–4.

In the 1974 Kuneitra Cup, the &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; entered the knockout phase after the group defeat of Sudan, Libya, Palestine and North Yemen. In the semifinals of the cup, they defeated Tunisia (3–1), but in the final, they unfortunately lost to Morocco after a penalty shootout.

For the 1974 World Cup, they finished second in the group in the 1st round of the qualification, behind Iran, insufficient to advance to the next round.

At the 1975 Palestine Cup, they eliminated Libya in the group stage, but lost to Iraq in the semifinals 0: 4 and in the bronze medal match with Sudan 0–1. In 1976, Damascus hosted the Arab Games, whose football tournament was played at the Abbasiyyin Stadium, where the home Syrian team won bronze medals.

In the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualification, the &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; did not go through the first round, as despite losing one victory over Saudi Arabia (2–0) they lost both matches to Iran, finishing in third place in the group.

=== 1980–1996: Milestones and missed opportunities ===
The Syrian team made it to the 1980 Olympics thanks to Iran, as the team withdrew due to the American-led boycott of the Olympics. Despite losing 0–3 to Algeria and 0–5 to the GDR, they gained experience from big matches. However, the most valuable result in the tournament was a draw with a strong Spain 0–0.

The Syrian team took part in the three editions of the Asian Nations Cup in the 1980s. In the 1980 Asian Cup, they finished 3rd out of 5 in the group stage, behind North Korea and Iran, ahead of China and Bangladesh. 

In the 1984 Asian Nations Cup, they finished 4th out of 5 in the 1st round, ahead of South Korea, behind Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In the 1988 Asian Nations Cup, they finished 3rd out of 5 still in the 1st round, behind China and Saudi Arabia, ahead of Kuwait and Bahrain. The two Syrian scorers were with one goal each: Walid Nasser and Walid Al-Hel. They were finalists in the Arab Nations Cup in 1988 (beaten by Iraq). 

For the qualifiers of the 1982 World Cup, they finished last in the group stage behind Qatar, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. As for the qualification round of the 1986 World Cup, Syria came very close to a qualification which would have been historic, since it passed the 1st round ahead of Kuwait and North Yemen, beat Bahrain and lost in the final qualifying round to Iraq 1–3 on aggregate, with the only Syrian goal scored by Walid Abu Al-Sel.
One of the greatest successes of the &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; in the 1980s was the participation in the finals of the 1987 Mediterranean Games, which took place in Latakia, and the defeat of the France team 2–1.

In the 1990 World Cup qualifiers, the national team placed second in the first round after losing to Saudi Arabia 4–5 (goal scorers: Mahrous, Jakalan, Al-Nasser and Helou).

In 1992, the Arab Games were held in Syria, which included the Arab Cup In this tournament, the Syrian national team led by Virgil Dridea placed 4th after advancing to the semifinals (losing to Egypt 4–3 on penalties) and losing in the bronze medal match with Kuwait 1–2.

During the 1994 World Cup qualifiers, they led the qualifying group after winning over Taiwan and Oman, but due to draws with Iran (0–0 and 1–1, goal scored by Abdul Latif Helou), they did not advance to the second round.

In the 1st round of the 1996 Asian Cup, the Syrian team beat Uzbekistan (2–1), thanks to goals from Nader Joukhadar and Ali Dib, but they were beaten by Japan (1–2, goal by Nader Joukhadar) and by China (0–3). By finishing 3rd in the group, they had a chance to qualify for the quarterfinals but having a low score compared to the other two countries (Iraq and South Korea), the team finished as the worst 3rd, again missed the knockout phase.

===1996–2007: Hope and disappointment===

At the 1997 Arab Games in Beirut, they reached the final, in which Jordan defeated them 0–1.

One of Syria&#x27;s biggest victories was recorded in Tehran on 4 June 1997, against the Maldives, a match that ended with a final score of 12–0 for the Syrians. 5 days later it faces again the Maldives, still in Tehran, which ends with the same score of 12–0. These two matches were played as a part of the qualification for the 1998 World Cup, where it was eliminated in the first preliminary round, ahead of Iran.

The Syrian team was twice finalist in 2000 and 2004 of a regional competition, the West Asian Football Championship, beaten each time by Iran; as they reached the semi-finals of the West Asian Championship 2002 held at home but lost to Jordan on a golden goal scored in the last minutes of extra time (1–2), before losing to Iran on penalties during the match for the 3rd place (2–2, 2–4). 

As for the qualification of the World Cup 2002, they were overtaken by Oman at 1st, while being ahead of the Philippines and Laos.

In the qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup, they did not advance to the third stage after uncertain match performances and losses with Bahrain (1–2) and Kyrgyzstan (0–1).

During this period, the national team participated in the 2007 Nehru Cup, where after the first victory over Bangladesh (2–0) they defeated Kyrgyzstan (4–1), India (3–2) and Cambodia (5–1) and advanced to the finals. The top scorers were famous Syrian stars Zyad Chaabo (5 goals) and Maher Al-Sayed (4 goals). But the cup final for the team did not turn out well, because they lost to India 0–1.

===2007–2012: Steady progress and first major title===

In 2007, Syria advanced to the WAAF Cup under the leadership of coach Fajr Ibrahim, where they after victories over Lebanon and Jordan (both 1–0), lost in the semifinals to Iraq 0–3.

A year later, the &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; took part in the 2008 WAAF Cup, where after a 2–1 victory over Oman and a draw with Jordan, they advanced to the semifinals, where they lost to Iran (0–2).

At the 2009 Nehru Cup, Syria sovereignly won the group stage, defeating Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon and, in a close match, India (1–0). In the final of the cup, they encountered India, with which they lost 1–2 on penalties (the only Syrian scorer was Ali Diab).

In the qualifications for the World Cup 2010, the team of Syria beat Afghanistan in the 1st round, then Indonesia in the 2nd round, but narrowly failed in the 3rd round to qualify for the 4th round, due to an unfavorable goal average, behind UAE and Iran, but ahead of Kuwait. 

The Syrian team qualified for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar after a long absence from it since 1996, where it ascended to the championship without any loss in the qualifiers. They were eliminated from the group stage again after losing to Jordan and Japan and defeating Saudi Arabia. Shortly afterwards, they were disqualified from the 2014 World Cup due to the use of an ineligible player. 

In December 2012, Syria beat Iraq in the final of West Asia Cup to collect its first major trophy and Ahmad Al Saleh became the scorer of the historic winning goal (1–0). Official Syrian television interrupted its broadcasts to announce the victory and show the presentation of the cup live.

===2013–2016: Away game challenges===
In 2013, the Syrian team withdrew from the WAAF Cup due to the Syrian Civil War. In the following years, the national team faced challenges due to being unable to play in their home stadiums.

The Syrian national team missed the 2015 AFC Asian Cup after failing to qualify and occupying third place in Group A which included Jordan, Singapore and Oman. In 2016, Syria took part in the King&#x27;s Cup under national team captain Mosab Balhous and head coach Ayman Hakeem, where they lost in the semifinals after a penalty shootout with Thailand and defeated the United Arab Emirates 1–0 in third place match.

=== 2018 World Cup qualifiers: Approaching success ===
Ever since war broke out in the country, Syria have been banned from playing home games in their own country and in fact were one day away from being thrown out of the 2018 World Cup only for Malaysia to swoop in at the last minute and offer to host all of Syria&#x27;s home games.

After finishing in second place in Group E during the 2018 World Cup 2nd qualifying round, behind Japan, but ahead of Singapore, Afghanistan and Cambodia. Syria was among the top 4 (2nd) and obtained the right to play in the 3rd round, in addition to being qualified for the next Asian Cup.

They were transferred to group A, along with Iran, South Korea, Uzbekistan, China and Qatar. On 5 September 2017, Syria qualified for the first time in their history for the play-offs of a World Cup by finishing 3rd in their group with 13 points, level on points with Uzbekistan, but ahead in the standings thanks to better goal difference, following of their draw gleaned in stoppage time on the lawn of the Iran (2–2) in the last match. 

This was the best performance by &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; to date in a World Cup qualifying phase. The prospect of a historic qualification for a final phase of the World Cup has given rise to a momentary halt to the conflict which has ravaged the country for six years, as well as the installation of giant screens by the authorities in the main public squares of major cities to follow the decisive match against Iran.

====Syria v Australia ====
On 5 October 2017 in Malacca, Syria managed to draw (1–1) against Australia thanks to a converted penalty in the 85th minute by Omar Al Somah, who had already equalized in stoppage time in the last pool match against Iran, responding to the opening goal in the first half of Robbie Kruse.

In the return match played five days later in Sydney, the Syrians opened the scoring in the 6th minute of play, once again thanks to Al Somah, but Tim Cahill tied the two teams seven minutes after the opening goal. 

The two teams continued to neutralize each other and it was in extra time that Australia took a decisive advantage in the 109th minute of play thanks to a new goal from Cahill, dashing Syria&#x27;s last hopes of participating in a World Cup. Reduced to 10 at the start of extra time, Syria nevertheless bravely tried their luck, narrowly missing the equalizer and qualification for the Intercontinental play-off during stoppage time in the 2nd half of extra time on a free kick from the essential Al Somah who found the post.

===2019 Asian Cup: A missed opportunity===
At the 2019 AFC Asian Cup (Group B) in the United Arab Emirates, Syria under the leadership of then-head coach Bernd Stange, the national team drew 0–0 with Palestine in the first match of the tournament. Syria failed to advance from the group stage after losing to Australia (2–3) and Jordan (0–2). 
The Syrian coach Bernd Stange was sacked after this tournament, and replaced with former manager Fajr Ibrahim. The team&#x27;s game didn&#x27;t improve much after this intervention as they suffered an agonizing loss to Australia after an injury time goal by Tom Rogic in the second half, confirming Syria&#x27;s elimination.

===2019–2024: Qualification setbacks===
In qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, which began in the fall of 2019, they were placed second in Group A of the 2nd round after the draw. In the first matches of the group, the &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; comfortably won first over the Philippines (5–2), Maldives (2–1) and Guam (4–0). Subsequently, in an important match, they defeated China 2–1 after Osama Omari&#x27;s goal and Zhang Linpeng&#x27;s own goal. In the next match, the national team defeated the Philippines 1–0 with a decisive goal by midfielder Ward Al Salama. On 11 March 2020, Tunisian Nabil Maâloul was appointed head coach of Syria.
The last matches in the group were played in 2021 due to COVID-19 in Asia, when they first defeated the Maldives (4–0) and Guam (3–0), confirming their 1st place, advanced to the 2023 AFC Asian Cup and also to the third stage of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. With the 1st place assured, Syria then lost to China 1–3 in the final game, which was irrelevant to the final standing. 
Nabil Maâloul resigned on June 15, 2021, due to disagreements with the leadership of the football federation. Nizar Mahrous replaced him for the next qualification phase. The team started this part of the qualification with unconvincing results with Iran (0–1), UAE (1–1) and South Korea (1–2), with both Syrian goals scored by Omar Khribin and Mahmoud Al Baher. After a humiliating defeat in the Levantine derby with Lebanon (2–3, the scorers were Khrbin and Somah), a draw with Iraq (1–1 only goal was scored by Somah) and a high defeat with Iran (0–3), the head coach Mahrous was fired.

At the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, under the leadership of new coach Valeriu Tița, they showed up in good form. They played the first match in Group B against the UAE, which they lost 1–2. In the next match, Syria played well despite the previous results, as Oliver Kass Kawo and Mouhamad Anez scored 2–0 over the big favorite from Tunisia. In their last group match, the &quot;Qasioun Eagles&quot; lost very badly to Mauritania 1–2 when the equalizing goal was scored by Mahmoud Al Baher in the 52nd minute. They took the 3rd place in the group and the 9th place overall.

In the last qualifying matches, they lost first to the UAE 0–2 then to South Korea with the same score, and due to these results, Tița was dismissed. Ghassan Maatouk was appointed as the new national head coach on February 9, 2022, leading the team to victory in the derby with Lebanon (3–0) and a draw with Iraq (1–1) in the last two matches. As a result, the Syrian team finished 5th in Group A.

==== 2023 AFC Asian Cup: First knockout stage ====
Syria qualified for their seventh AFC Asian Cup in 2023, and during this tournament, they made the knockout stage for the first time in their history by ranking as one of the best ranked third place team, after being drawn into Group B alongside Australia, India and Uzbekistan. In the round of 16, Syria lost against Iran in the penalty shootouts following a 1–1 draw after extra time, despite their numerical superiority at the start of injury time following a 2nd yellow card for Mehdi Taremi.

==== 2024: Further challenges ====
Following two consecutive losses against North Korea and Japan in the last two matches of the 2026 World Cup qualifying second round, Syria finished third in their group to miss another World Cup participation and drop to compete in the Asian Cup qualifying third round.

=== 2024–present: New beginnings ===
Following the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, the Syrian Football Federation announced a change in the national team&#x27;s home kit and logo colors, shifting from red to green. The federation stated that the decision symbolized a historic transformation, marking the end of nepotism, favoritism, and corruption in Syrian football. Additionally, the team adopted a new all-green home kit, manufactured by Jako.

<doc id="1131674" wikidata="Q1410940" url="?curid=1131674" title="Muzzle energy">
<text>Muzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the muzzle of a firearm. Without consideration of factors such as aerodynamics and gravity for the sake of comparison, muzzle energy is used as a rough indication of the destructive potential of a given firearm or cartridge. The heavier the bullet and especially the faster it moves, the higher its muzzle energy and the more damage it will do.

==Kinetic energy==

The general formula for the kinetic energy is
formula_1
where &quot;v&quot; is the velocity of the bullet and &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the bullet.

Although both mass and velocity contribute to the muzzle energy, the muzzle energy is proportional to the mass while proportional to the &quot;square&quot; of the velocity. The velocity of the bullet is a more important determinant of muzzle energy. For a constant velocity, if the mass is doubled, the energy is doubled; however, for a constant mass, if the velocity is doubled, the muzzle energy increases &quot;four&quot; times. In the SI system the above &quot;E&quot;k will be in unit joules if the mass, &quot;m&quot;, is in kilograms, and the speed, &quot;v&quot;, is in metres per second.

==Typical muzzle energies of common firearms and cartridges==

Muzzle energy is dependent upon the factors previously listed, and velocity is highly variable depending upon the length of the barrel a projectile is fired from. Also the muzzle energy is only an upper limit for how much energy is transmitted to the target, and the effects of a ballistic trauma depend on several other factors as well. There is wide variation in commercial ammunition. A bullet fired from .357 Magnum handgun can achieve a muzzle energy of . A bullet fired from the same gun might only achieve of muzzle energy, depending upon the manufacturer of the cartridge. Some .45 Colt +P ammunition can produce of muzzle energy.

==Legal requirements on muzzle energy==

Many parts of the world use muzzle energy to classify guns into categories that require different categories of licence. In general guns that have the potential to be more dangerous have tighter controls, while those of minimal energy, such as small air pistols or air rifles, require little more than user registration, or in some countries have no restrictions at all. Overview of gun laws by nation indicates the various approaches taken. Firearms regulation in the United Kingdom is a complicated example, but is demarked by muzzle energy as well as barrel length and ammunition diameter.

Some jurisdictions also stipulate &quot;minimum&quot; muzzle energies for safe hunting. For example, in Denmark rifle ammunition used for hunting the largest types of game there such as red deer must have a kinetic energy &quot;E&quot;100 (i.e.: at range) of at least and a bullet mass of at least or alternatively an &quot;E&quot;100 of at least and a bullet mass of at least . Namibia specifies three levels of minimum muzzle energy for hunting depending on the size of the game, for game such as springbok, for game such as hartebeest, and for Big Five game, together with a minimum caliber of .

In Germany, airsoft guns with a muzzle energy of no more than are exempt from the gun law, while air guns with a muzzle energy of no more than may be acquired without a firearms license.

Mainland China uses a varied concept of &quot;muzzle ratio kinetic energy&quot; (), which is the quotient (ratio) of the muzzle energy divided by the bore cross sectional area, to distinguish genuine guns from &quot;imitation&quot; replicas like toy guns. The Ministry of Public Security unilaterally introduced the concept in 2008 leading up to the Beijing Olympic Games, dictating that anything over 1.8 J/cm2 to be defined as real firearms. This caused many existing toy gun products on the Chinese market (particularly airsoft) to become illegal overnight, as almost all airsoft guns shooting a standard pellet have a muzzle velocity over , which translates to more than of muzzle energy, or 2.0536 J/cm2 of &quot;ratio energy&quot;. For comparison a standard baseball changeup thrown at has 1.951 J/cm2 of &quot;ratio energy&quot; which also exceeds the 1.8 J/cm2 of a real firearm while a fastball can reach over 3.5 J/cm2 or nearly double the level of a real firearm. The subsequent crackdowns by local law enforcement led to many seizures, arrests and prosecutions of individual owners for &quot;trafficking and possession of illegal weapons&quot; over the years for weapons that were previously permitted.

<text>Wideok (525–598) (r. 554–598) was the 27th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of King Seong, and rose to the throne upon his father&#x27;s death.

==Background==
During Seong&#x27;s reign, Baekje had led an alliance with the neighboring Silla and the Gaya confederacy to attack the powerful northern kingdom of Goguryeo. In 551, Baekje successfully reclaimed from Goguryeo the present-day Seoul region, which was Baekje&#x27;s capital from its founding until 475. However, Silla betrayed the alliance and, under a secret agreement with Goguryeo, claimed the territory for itself.

As crown prince, Wideok organized the reprisal attack on Silla, despite opposition by the aristocracy. He participated in the , in which his father and nearly 30,000 men died fighting the Silla army. That disastrous campaign led to the aristocracy of Baekje taking some power away from the kings.

==Reign==
Baekje under Wideok was inimical with both Silla and Goguryeo, launching various battles and border incursions against the rival kingdoms.

To avoid isolation, and to strengthen the royal position against the power of the aristocracy, he maintained friendly relations with the Chinese dynasties of Chen, Northern Qi and Sui. Although ties had been largely broken following the cataclysmic events of the 550s, he sent missions to the Chen court in 567, 577, 584, and 586 (it fell to Sui shortly thereafter). In 567, he sent Baekje&#x27;s first mission to Northern Qi; this may have been facilitated by an improved relationship with Goguryeo. In 570, the Northern Qi granted him titles including &quot;Duke of Daifang commandery&quot;, and he sent another tribute mission in 572. After Northern Qi was conquered by Northern Zhou in 577, Baekje also sent a congratulatory mission including musicians to the Zhou court. The following year, a second and final embassy was sent to Northern Zhou, which was replaced by Sui in 581.

Wideok sent an immediate congratulatory mission to the Sui court in 581, and another in 582. In 589 Sui conquered Chen and united China. In the same year, a Sui warship happened to run aground on Jeju Island, which was ruled by the Baekje dependency of Tamna. Wideok provided the crew with an official escort (bearing tribute and congratulations) to the Chinese court. In 598 he sent an embassy offering to assist in the Sui expedition against Goguryeo that year. The expedition, however, had already been completed. Yeongyang of Goguryeo launched punitive attacks on Baekje&#x27;s northern border when he learned of this.

Continuing the legacy of his father, Wideok sent various Buddhist missions to Yamato period Japan.

==Relics==
In 1995, a stone relic box was found in a Baekje-era Buddhist temple in Buyeo County, South Chungcheong Province. Inscriptions on its face say it was made in 567 under Wideok&#x27;s order. In 1996, the South Korean government designated the box as South Korean national treasure No. 288. It is held by the Buyeo National Museum.

<text>Podolsk () is an industrial city, center of Podolsk Urban Okrug, Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Pakhra River (a tributary of the Moskva River). Population: 

==History==

The first mentions of the village of Podol, which belonged to the votchina of the Danilov Monastery, are contained in the church letopis of 1627-1628. On October 5, 1781, by the personal decree of Catherine II, the Podolsky Uyezd was formed, and the village of Podol was renamed the city of Podolsk. 

Podolsk land is directly connected with the events of the Patriotic War of 1812. After the Battle of Borodino, the troops under the leadership of Mikhail Kutuzov, passing through Podolsk, took up defensive positions near the village of Krasnaya Pakhra, Podolsk district, then approached Tarutino, setting up a camp here. The famous Tarutino maneuver determined the entire further victorious course of the war with the Napoleonic army. 

After the Patriotic War of 1812, Podolsk and Podolsk uyezd restored and expanded their economic functions, primarily trade. This, in particular, was facilitated by the construction in 1844-1847 of the Warsaw (Brest-Litovsk) highway, as well as the construction of a bridge across the Pakhra river. In the 1840s, 13 manufactories worked in the uyezd. Among the cities near Moscow, Podolsk in the second half of the 19th century stood out with the highest population growth rate. In 1900, the American company &quot;Singer&quot; founded in Podolsk a mechanical plant for the assembly of sewing machines and the production of parts for them and had become one of the city-forming enterprises of Podolsk, causing city&#x27;s economic growth at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1917 the stone buildings of a realschule, a cinema, a power plant, and a water supply were built, and the number of citizens reached 19 thousand.

In the 1930s, American communist writer Myra Page described Podolsk in her pamphlet &quot;Soviet Main Street&quot;.

In 1971, Podolsk was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. In the Soviet times, Podolsk was one of the industrial giants in Moscow Oblast. At that time, more than seventy factories were operating in the city. Most of the citizens were working at these plants. 

In January 2024, almost half of the population was left without heat after a heating main burst at a nearby ammunition plant.

Podolsk is the site of the Central Archives of the Russian Ministry of Defence.Podolsk was on the front line in the Battle of Moscow and Germany got into its Western Perimeter and suburbs.

==Administrative and municipal status==

<doc id="1131689" wikidata="Q1422268" url="?curid=1131689" title="Presbyterian Church of Wales">
<text>The Presbyterian Church of Wales (), also known as the Calvinistic Methodist Church (), is a denomination of Protestant Christianity based in Wales.

The Calvinistic Methodist movement has its origins in the 18th-century Welsh Methodist revival. The early movement was led principally by Welsh revivalist Daniel Rowland, who was influenced by the teachings of the Welsh Methodist leader Howell Harris and the theologian John Calvin. As such, Calvinistic Methodism places a strong emphasis on the sovereignty of God and the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. 

The movement had a profound impact on Welsh society and culture, and it played a significant role in the Welsh revivals of the 19th century. Calvinistic Methodism formerly also had a significant presence in England, under the spiritual leadership of George Whitefield. Today, the large majority of the Presbyterian Church of Wales&#x27; congregations are in Wales (predominantly Welsh-speaking, but some English), but it also has a few local churches in the west of England (English-speaking).

== History ==

The church was born as the Calvinistic Methodists out of the Welsh Methodist revival and the preaching of Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. Calvinistic Methodism became a major denomination in Wales, growing rapidly in the 19th century, and taking a leadership role in the Welsh Religious Revival of 1904-5. In 1823, a Confession of Faith was created and adopted, based on the standard Westminster Confession. Theological colleges for ministerial training were opened in Bala, then in Merionethshire, now Gwynedd (1837), Trefeca, then in Brecknockshire, now Powys (1842), and Aberystwyth, in Ceredigion (1906). It produces a quarterly journal &quot;Y Traethodydd&quot; and a monthly periodical &quot;The Treasury&quot;. It is distinguished from other forms of Methodism by the Calvinistic nature of its theology. In 1840, the Foreign Missionary Society was formed in Liverpool to provide missionaries to India. It held its first general assembly in 1864.

Calvinistic Methodism claims to be the only Christian denomination in Wales to be of purely Welsh origin, and is rare among Presbyterian churches, by originating in the Methodist revival rather than deriving from the Calvinist Reformation. In 18th-century England, Calvinistic Methodism was represented by the followers of George Whitefield as opposed to those of John and Charles Wesley, although all the early Methodists in England and Wales worked together, regardless of Calvinist or Arminian (or Wesleyan) theology, for many years. With Calvinistic Methodists being absorbed into Presbyterianism, Methodism became defined by its adherence to Wesleyan-Arminian theology.

===Beginnings===
The movement&#x27;s beginnings may be traced to the Rev. Griffith Jones (1684–1761), Church of England rector of Llanddowror, Carmarthenshire, whose sympathy for the poor led him to set on foot a system of circulating charity schools for the education of children. Griffith Jones&#x27;s zeal, which contrasted strikingly with the general apathy of the clergy of the period, appealed to the public imagination, and his powerful preaching exercised a widespread influence. Many travelled long distances in order to attend his ministry. There was thus a considerable number of earnest people dispersed throughout the country waiting for the rousing of the parish clergy.

===Daniel Rowland and Howell Harris===

Griffith Jones, preaching at Llanddewi Brefi, Cardiganshire, found Daniel Rowland (1713–1790), curate of Llangeitho, in his audience, and his patronising attitude in listening drew from the preacher a personal supplication on his behalf in the middle of the discourse. Rowland was deeply moved, and became an ardent apostle of the new movement. Naturally a fine orator, his new-born zeal gave an edge to his eloquence and his fame spread abroad.

In May 1735, Howell Harris (1714–1773) underwent a religious conversion after listening to a sermon at Talgarth on the necessity of partaking of Holy Communion. This led to several weeks of self-examination and reached a climax at Communion on Whitsunday, May 1735. He immediately began to hold meetings in his own home, encouraging others to seek the same assurance that he had of Christ&#x27;s forgiveness, and was soon invited to do the same at the houses of others. He became a fiery itinerant preacher, stirring to the depths every neighbourhood he visited. Harris&#x27; eldest brother sent him to Oxford in the autumn of 1735 where his friends hoped he &quot;should be effectually cured of [his] &#x27;enthusiasm&#x27;, as they called it&quot;, but he left in the following February.

In 1736, on returning home, Harris opened a school, Griffith Jones supplying him with books from his charity. He also set up societies, in accordance with the recommendations in Josiah Wedgwood&#x27;s little book on the subject; and these exercised a great influence on the religious life of the people. By far the most notable of Harris&#x27;s converts was William Williams of Pantycelyn (1717–1791), the famous hymn-writer of Wales, who while listening to the revivalist preaching on a tombstone in the graveyard of Talgarth, felt he was &quot;apprehended as by a warrant from on high&quot;. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England, 1740, but George Whitefield recommended him to leave his curacies in order to preach on highways and hedges.

Rowlands and Harris had been at work fully eighteen months before they met in 1737 at a service in Devynock church in the upper part of Breconshire. The acquaintance then formed lasted to the end of Harris&#x27;s life.

In January 1743, Whitefield chaired a meeting at Plas Watford near Caerphilly, Glamorgan, attended by Rowland, Williams, Harris, John Humphreys, John Powell — afterwards of Llanmartin – and a layman called John Cennick. They met in order to organise their societies. Seven lay exhorters were also at the meetings; they were questioned as to their spiritual experience and allotted their several spheres; other matters pertaining to the new conditions created by the revival were arranged. This is known as the first Methodist Association, held eighteen months before John Wesley&#x27;s first conference (June 25, 1744).

Monthly meetings covering smaller districts, were organised to consider local matters, the transactions of which were to be reported to the Quarterly Association, to be confirmed, modified, or rejected. Exhorters were divided into two classes — public, who were allowed to itinerate as preachers and superintend a number of societies; and private, who were confined to the charge of one or two societies. The societies were distinctly understood to be part of the Church of England and every attempt at estranging them from the Church was reproved; but persecution made their position anomalous. They did not accept the discipline of the Church of England, so the plea of conformity was a feeble defence; nor had they taken out licenses, so as to claim the protection of the Toleration Act. Harris&#x27;s ardent loyalty to the Church of England, after three refusals to ordain him, and his personal contempt for ill-treatment from persecutors, were the only things that prevented separation.

A controversy on a doctrinal point &quot;Did God die on Calvary?&quot; raged for some time, the principal disputants being Rowlands and Harris; and in 1751 it ended in an open rupture, which threw the Connexion first into confusion and then into a state of coma. The societies split up into Harrisites and Rowlandites, and it was only with the revival of 1762 that the breach was fairly repaired. This revival is a landmark in the history of the Connexion.

William Williams Pantycelyn had just published (1744) a little volume of hymns entitled &quot;Aleluia&quot;, the singing of which inflamed the people. This led the Bishop of St. David&#x27;s to suspend Rowlands&#x27;s licence, and Rowlands had to confine himself to a meeting-house at Llangeitho. Having been turned out of other churches, he had leased a plot of land in 1759, anticipating the final withdrawal of his license, in 1763, and a spacious building was erected to which the people crowded from all parts on Sacrament Sunday. Llangeitho became the centre of Welsh Methodism; and Rowland&#x27;s popularity never waned until his physical powers gave way.

===Peter Williams and Thomas Charles===
A notable event in the history of Welsh Methodism was the publication in 1770, of a 4th annotated Welsh Bible by the Rev. Peter Williams, a forceful preacher and an indefatigable worker, who had joined the Methodists in 1746 after being driven from several curacies. It gave birth to a new interest in Scripture, being the first definite commentary in the language. A powerful revival broke out at Llangeitho in the spring of 1780 and spread to the south but not to the north of Wales.

In North Wales, the Rev. Thomas Charles (1755–1814) became a major figure. Having spent five years in Somerset as curate of several parishes, Charles returned to his native North Wales to marry Sarah Jones of Bala. Failing to find employment in the established church, he joined the Methodists in 1784. His circulating charity schools and then his Sunday schools gradually made the North a new country. In 1791 a revival began at Bala, a few months after the Bala Association had been ruffled by the proceedings which led to the expulsion of Peter Williams from the Connection, in order to prevent him from selling John Canne&#x27;s Bible among the Methodists, because of some Sabellian marginal notes. 

In 1790 the Bala Association passed rules regarding the proper mode of conducting the Quarterly Association, drawn up by Charles; in 1801, Charles and Thomas Jones of Mold, published (for the association) the &quot;Rules and Objects of the Private Societies among the People called Methodists&quot;. About 1795, persecution led the Methodists to take the first step towards separation from the Church of England. Heavy fines made it impossible for preachers in poor circumstances to continue without claiming the protection of the Toleration Act, and the meeting-houses had to be registered as dissenting chapels. In a large number of cases this had only been delayed by so constructing the houses that they were used both as dwellings and as chapels at one and the same time. Until 1811 the Calvinistic Methodists had no ministers ordained by themselves; their enormous growth in numbers and the scarcity of ministers to administer the Sacrament — only three in North Wales, two of whom had joined only at the dawn of the century made the question of ordination a matter of urgency. The South Wales clergy who regularly itinerated were dying out; the majority of those remaining itinerated but irregularly, and were most of them against the change. The lay element, with the help of Charles and a few other stalwarts, carried the matter through ordaining nine at Bala in June, and thirteen at Llandilo in August. In 1823, the Confession of Faith of the Connextion of Calvinistic Methodists in Wales was published following the Association meetings in Aberystwyth and Bala that year; it is based on the Westminster Confession as Calvinistically construed, and contains 44 articles. The Connection&#x27;s Constitutional Deed was formally completed in 1826 and tied all its property to the ascension to its Confession of Faith.

===Trevecca College===
Thomas Charles had tried to arrange for taking over Trevecca College when the trustees of the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion removed their seminary to Cheshunt in 1791; but the Bala revival broke out just at the time, and, when things grew quieter, other matters pressed for attention. A college had been mooted in 1816, but the intended tutor died suddenly, and the matter was for the time dropped. Candidates for the Connexional ministry were compelled to shift for themselves until 1837, when Lewis Edwards (1809–1887) and David Charles (1812–1878) opened a school for young men at Bala. North and South alike adopted it as their college, the associations contributing a hundred guineas each towards the education of their students. In 1842, the South Wales Association opened a college at Trevecca, leaving Bala to the North; the Rev. David Charles became principal of the former, and the Rev. Lewis Edwards of the latter. After the death of Lewis Edwards, T. C. Edwards resigned the principalship of the University College at Aberystwyth to become head of Bala (1891), now a purely theological college, the students of which were sent to the university colleges for their classical training. In 1905, David Davies of Llandinam, one of the laymen in the Connection, offered a large building at Aberystwyth as a gift to the denomination for the purpose of uniting North and South in one theological college; but in the event of either association declining the proposal, the other was permitted to take possession, giving the association that should decline the option of joining at a later time. The Association of the South accepted, and that of the North declined, the offer; Trevecca College was turned into a preparatory school on the lines of a similar institution set up at Bala in 1891.

===Missions===
The missionary collections of the denomination were given to the London Missionary Society from 1798 to 1840, when a Connectional Society was formed; and no better instances of missionary enterprise are known than those of the Khasia and Jaintia Hills, Lushai Hills (Mizoram) and the Plains of Sylhet in northern India. The Presbyterian Church of India is the result of this missionary activity. There had also been a mission in Brittany since 1842.

===Constitution===
The constitution of the denomination (called in Welsh, &quot;Hen Gorff&quot;, i.e. the &quot;Old Body&quot; because, at its formation in 1811 issuing from the Anglican Church, it was an established &#x27;body&#x27; or Connexion of believers with roots hailing back to the Methodist Revival), is a mixture of Presbyterianism and Congregationalism; each particular society constituted themselves to be churches and manage its own affairs and were to report (I) to the district meeting, (2) to the monthly meeting, the nature of each report determining its destination. The monthly meetings (known now as Presbytery meetings) were, and continue to be made up of all the officers of the churches comprised in each, and are split up into districts for the purpose of a more local co-operation of the churches. The monthly meetings appointed delegates to the quarterly Associations (now bi-annually), of which all officers are members. The Associations of North and South are distinct institutions, deliberating and determining matters pertaining to them in their separate gatherings. For the purpose of a fuller cooperation in matters common to both, a general assembly, which meets once a year, was established in 1864. This is a purely deliberative conclave, worked by committees, and all its decisions have to be confirmed by the Association meeting in its three provinces before it can have any force. The annual conference of the English churches of the denomination had no decision-making power, and was meant for social and spiritual intercourse and discussion until 1944, when the Association in the East was established with equal standing, forming, together with the North and the South, one Association in three provinces.

===Turn of the century===
The Calvinistic Methodists formed in some respects the strongest church in Wales, and its Forward Movement, headed by Dr. John Pugh of Cardiff, brought thousands into its fold since its establishment in 1891. Its Connexional Book Room, opened in 1891, yielded an annual profit (at the time) of from £1,600 to £2,000, the profits being devoted to help the colleges and to establish Sunday school libraries, etc. Its chapels in 1907 numbered 1,641 (with accommodation for 488,080), manses 229; its churches numbered 1,428, ministers 921, unordained preachers 318, elders 6,179; its Sunday Schools 1,731, teachers 27,895, scholars 193,460, communicants 189,164, total collections for religious purposes 300,912. The statistics of the Indian Mission (at the time, known now as The Presbyterian Church of India) were equally good: communicants 8,027, adherents 26,787, missionaries 23, native ministers (ordained) 15, preachers (not ordained) 60, and have continued to grow ever since.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:
===Presbyterian Church in Wales===
In 1928 it officially adopted the name &quot;Presbyterian Church in Wales&quot; but still retained the name &quot;Welsh Calvinistic Methodism&quot; with equal standing. In 1933 its constitution was modified as a result of the Presbyterian Church in Wales Act of Parliament in 1933, receiving Royal assent. In 1947 the Association in the East was established for English-speaking churches. In 1978 Pamela Turner became the first woman to be ordained as a minister. In 2004 the central office moved to Whitchurch, Cardiff. In 2007 new boundaries and structures was adopted for presbyteries.

== Statistics ==

As of statistics recorded in June 2022, the Presbyterian Church of Wales has around 12,938 members who worship in around 471 churches. It is estimated, that because of continued decline, the Church of Wales may be extinct by 2033, as decline which has been taking place since 1905, is still progressing. 

Most of these churches are in Wales, but due to strong historical links between the Welsh and certain English cities, there are churches using both the English and the Welsh languages in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool.
Churches belong to one of eighteen Presbyteries, grouped into three Provinces, the Association in the South, the Association in the North (Welsh language), and the Association in the East (English language), along with a General Assembly.

The Church offices are located at the Tabernacle Church, 81, Merthyr Road, Whitchurch, Cardiff CF14 1DD.

== Social issues ==

The church is active in discussing social issues within Wales.

In 2013, the denomination responded to a consultation on blessing same-sex unions. In response, it decided not to have an official doctrine on the matter, allowing each local congregation to have its own practice regarding whether or not to bless same-sex unions. This position led to a protest from some of its members and the resignation of officials of the denomination, who saw, in this decision, the permission for the celebration of marriages between people of the same sex.

The church has ordained women as ministers since 1978.

== Presbyteries and chapels ==
== Chapel names ==
In the Welsh chapel tradition, chapels, rather than being dedicated to a particular saint, are named after places from the Bible. Because these place-names are written in Welsh orthography (in some cases based on the spellings used in the Authorised Version or William Morgan&#x27;s Bible), and because several of the place-names are quite obscure to the interested reader, the table below identifies the referents of these dedications. Welsh words used in chapel names that have a theological meaning are also included. If a chapel name cannot be identified in the below list, it probably refers to a neighbourhood or locality within the town or village in which the chapel is located, or is an adjective such as &quot;Hen&quot; (old), &quot;Hyfrydle&quot; (delightful), &quot;Newydd&quot; (new) or &quot;Unedig&quot; (united).

<text>The Malabar Coast moist forests are a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of southwestern India.

==Geography==
The ecoregion lies along India&#x27;s Konkan and Malabar coasts, in a narrow strip between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats range, which runs parallel to the coast. It has an area of , and extends from northern Maharashtra through Goa, Karnataka and Kerala to Kanniyakumari in southernmost Tamil Nadu.

The ecoregion extends from sea level to the 250 meter contour of the Western Ghats. It is bounded on the east by the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests in Maharashtra and Karnataka, and the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests in Kerala.

Much of the ecoregion is densely populated, and it includes several large cities, including Mumbai in Maharashtra, Mormugao and Margao in Goa, Mangalore in Karnataka, and Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kozhikode in Kerala.

==Climate==
The climate is tropical and humid. Rainfall varies seasonally, falling mostly with the southwest monsoon between June and September. Rainfall is generally higher in the south, decreasing and becoming more seasonal as one moves north.

==Flora==
The original vegetation in the ecoregion was tropical evergreen rainforest, with some deciduous trees particularly in drier areas. The original forests have mostly been replaced with or interspersed with teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;), a mostly deciduous tree that drops its leaves during the winter dry season.

Characteristic canopy trees include &quot;Tetrameles nudiflora, Stereospermum personatum, Dysoxylum binectariferum, Ficus nervosa, Ficus glomerata, Pterocarpus marsupium, Salmalia malabarica, Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia tomentosa, Anogeissus latifolia, Dalbergia latifolia, Lannea coromandelica, Madhuca indica, Garuga pinnata, Syzygium cumini, Olea dioica, Pouteria tomentosa, Bridelia retusa, Mangifera&quot; spp., and &quot;Actinodaphne angustifolia&quot;. There is an understorey of low trees (&quot;Erythrina variegata, Butea monosperma, Wrightia tinctoria, Bauhinia racemosa&quot;, and &quot;Zizyphus rugosa&quot;) and shrubs (&quot;Flacourtia spp., Woodfordia fruticosa, Meyna laxiflora&quot;, and &quot;Carissa congesta&quot;).

In drier areas along Karnataka&#x27;s northern coast, the deciduous trees &quot;Lagerstroemia microcarpa&quot;, teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;), and &quot;Dillenia pentagyna&quot; are predominant.

Swamp forests of &quot;Myristica&quot; spp. are found in low-lying coastal areas, but are now endangered. The Kerala Backwaters are an extensive coastal lagoon system in the southern portion of the ecoregion.

==Fauna==
There are 97 native mammal species in the ecoregion. The ecoregion&#x27;s remaining habitat is too limited and fragmented to support viable populations of most larger mammals, including Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;), tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris)&quot; sloth bear (&quot;Melursus ursinus&quot;), gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;), and dhole (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;). Wild tigers and Asian elephants are locally extinct, but still found in adjacent portions of the Western Ghats. The other large mammals are locally threatened.

Several smaller mammals are threatened by habitat loss, including the gray slender loris (&quot;Loris lydekkerianus&quot;), Jerdon&#x27;s palm civet (&quot;Paradoxurus jerdoni&quot;), and grizzled giant squirrel (&quot;Ratufa macroura&quot;).

The ecoregion has one strictly endemic species, the Kerala rat (&quot;Rattus ranjiniae&quot;). Day&#x27;s shrew (&quot;Suncus dayi&quot;) is found in both the Malabar Coast forests and the adjacent South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests. The Nilgiri langur (&quot;Semnopithecus johnii&quot;), Jerdon&#x27;s civet, and the Malabar large-spotted civet (&quot;Viverra civettina&quot;) also inhabit the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests and South Western Ghats montane forests. The Travancore flying squirrel (&quot;Petinomys fuscocapillus&quot;) is found in the ecoregion and on Sri Lanka.

There are 280 native species of birds, including the Malabar grey hornbill (&quot;Ocyceros griseus&quot;), Indian grey hornbill (&quot;Ocyceros birostris&quot;), great hornbill (&quot;Buceros bicornis&quot;), lesser florican (&quot;Sypheotides indicus&quot;), and greater flamingo (&quot;Phoenicopterus roseus&quot;).

==Conservation and threats==
Very little of the natural vegetation of the ecoregion remains; it has largely been cleared for agriculture, grazing, and teak plantations.

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that 1,251 km², or 4%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include:

* Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Maharashtra (50 km²)
* Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, Goa (150 km²)
* Peechi-Vazhani Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala (100 km²)
* Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharashtra
* Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, Kerala

* Idamalayar Reserve Forest (partly in the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests and the South Western Ghats montane rain forests)

<text>Samuel Johannesen Balto (May 5, 1861 – 1921) was a Northern Saami explorer and adventurer. Balto skied with Fridtjof Nansen across Greenland in 1888–89.
==Biography==
Samuel Johannesen Balto was born in Karasjok Municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. He had worked as a lumberjack, as well as in reindeer herding and fishing. In 1888, Balto was recruited by Fridtjof Nansen for Nansen&#x27;s Trans-Greenland Expedition. Balto participated in the first recorded crossing of the interior of Greenland, together with Nansen and four other expedition members. Balto wrote his own book after the expedition: &quot;Med Nansen over Grønlandsisen i 1888 – Min reise fra Sameland til Grønland&quot;.

In 1898, Balto moved to Alaska and signed a two-year contract as a reindeer herder. In 1900, he led a large group of Sámi hired as reindeer herdsmen during the Lapland-Yukon Relief Expedition later known as the &quot;Manitoba Expedition&quot;. Samuel Balto, together with 113 other people from Finnmark were hired by Sheldon Jackson to be involved in the introduction of reindeer in Alaska. Jackson promoted a plan to import reindeer from Russia to introduce reindeer husbandry to the Inupiaq as a solution to their loss of subsistence resources. The group was responsible for transporting goods and mail from Nome, Alaska, to gold mining workers up the Yukon River valley in the central parts of Alaska. Eventually Samuel Balto became a gold miner at Nome, Alaska, during the Klondike Gold Rush. Balto staked three claims at a site which became known as Balto Creek.

Samuel Johannesen Balto died in 1921 in Karasjok. Balto, the Alaskan sled dog made famous during the 1925 serum run to Nome, which transported diphtheria medication across the U.S. territory of Alaska to combat an epidemic, was named in his honor.

<text>Dmitrov () is a town and the administrative center of Dmitrovsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located to the north of Moscow on the Yakhroma River and the Moscow Canal. Population: 

==History==
Dmitrov is one of the oldest urban areas in Moscow Oblast. The town was originally founded by Yury Dolgoruky in 1154, where his son Vsevolod was born. Its name is explained by the fact that Vsevolod&#x27;s patron saint was St. Demetrius.

In the 13th century, the settlement marked a point where the borders of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Tver, and Pereslavl-Zalessky converged. The settlement itself belonged to the princes of Galich-Mersky, located much to the north, until 1364, when it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Both Dmitry Donskoy and his grandson Vasily II granted Dmitrov as an appanage to their younger sons, so Dmitrov was the capital of a tiny principality. In 1374, it was given town rights.

The reign of Ivan III&#x27;s son Yury Ivanovich (1503–1533) inaugurated the golden age of Dmitrov. It is during his reign that the black-domed Assumption Cathedral in the kremlin and a smaller monastery cathedral of Sts. Boris and Gleb were built. Thereafter, the town passed to Yury&#x27;s brother, Andrey of Staritsa. In 1569, it was seized from Vladimir of Staritsa, added to the Oprichnina and consequently went into a decline. The town suffered further damage during the Time of Troubles, when it was ransacked by the Poles.

In 1812, Dmitrov was briefly occupied by the Grande Armée. The Anarchist prince Peter Kropotkin spent his last years there after the Russian Revolution. In the 1930s, the local kremlin was excavated by Soviet archaeologists. In November 1941, German troops occupied the town and crossed the Moscow-Volga Canal from there.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Dmitrov serves as the administrative center of Dmitrovsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with eighty rural localities, incorporated within Dmitrovsky District as the Town of Dmitrov. As a municipal division, the Town of Dmitrov is incorporated within Dmitrovsky Municipal District as Dmitrov Urban Settlement.

==Transportation==
Dmitrov is a railway junction of the Moscow (Savyolovsky terminal)–Savyolovo branch and the Dmitrov–Alexandrov branch. The railway provides an efficient service to Moscow. Dmitrov is also a cargo port on the Moscow Canal.

Bus routes connect Dmitrov with Moscow (Altufyevo), Sergiyev Posad, Dubna, Taldom, Lobnya, Laryovo, and other destinations.

==Miscellaneous==
*Dmitrov&#x27;s altitude above sea level is .
*In a national competition in 2005, Dmitrov was recognized as the best-run town in Russia.

<doc id="1131710" wikidata="Q7316566" url="?curid=1131710" title="Resuscitator">
<text>A resuscitator is a device using positive pressure to inflate the lungs of an unconscious person who is not breathing, in order to keep them oxygenated and alive. There are three basic types: a &quot;manual&quot; version (also known as a &quot;bag valve mask&quot;) consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the &quot;expired air&quot; or breath powered resuscitator. The third type is an &quot;oxygen powered&quot; resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are time cycled, volume constant ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver more than 85% oxygen when a gas source is available.

==Mechanism and function==
===Manual resuscitators===

Manual resuscitators, also known as bag valve masks, consist of a flexible oro-nasal face-mask with non-return valves and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The mask covers the mouth and nose, and has a peripheral seal that fits most face shapes, and is generally held in place by the operator.
===Expired air resuscitators===

A pocket mask, or pocket face mask or CPR mask, is an expired air resuscitation device used to safely deliver rescue breaths during a cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest. It is a small portable device used in the pre-hospital setting to provide emergency ventilation to a patient who is either in respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. The pocket mask is designed to be placed over the lower face of the patient, creating a seal enclosing both the mouth and nose. Air is then administered to the patient by the responder who exhales through a one-way filter valve. The system is capable of delivering up to 16% oxygen with exhaled air.

Modern pocket masks have either a built in one-way valve or a disposable filter to protect the operator responder from potentially infectious bodily fluids, such as vomit or blood. Many masks also have a built-in oxygen addition tube, allowing for administration of 50-60% oxygen.

===Oxygen powered resuscitators===
== History ==

Resuscitators began in 1907 when Heinrich Dräger, owner of the Drägerwerk AG Company, produced the &quot;Pulmotor&quot; Resuscitator. Considered to be the first practical device for delivering oxygen to unconscious patients or patients in respiratory distress, the Pulmotor influenced resuscitators for many years.
When ambulance services began to form in major cities around the world, such as in London, New York and Los Angeles, Emergency medical services or EMS was developed. In these early days, perhaps the most advanced piece of equipment carried on these ambulances were devices for delivering supplemental oxygen to patients in respiratory distress. The Pulmotor and later models, such as the Emerson Resuscitator, used heavy cylinders of oxygen to power a device which forced air into the patient&#x27;s lungs. While better than no oxygen at all, these old units were problematic. Aside from often failing to sense obstructions in the airway, the Emerson, and to a lesser degree the Pulmotor, were large, bulky and heavy. The Emerson Resuscitator required two strong men to carry it from the ambulance to the victim. Perhaps the greatest defect, however, was the fact that these units &quot;cycled&quot;.

Cycling was a feature that was built into most resuscitators built before the 1960s, including the Pulmotor and Emerson models. To ensure that the victim&#x27;s lungs were not injured from being over-inflated, the resuscitator was pre-set to provide what was considered a safe pressure of oxygen. Once the unit reached this limit, it ceased to pump oxygen. For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or any form of obstructive lung disease, the delivered pressure was insufficient pressure to fill the lungs with oxygen, meaning that, for patients with any sort of obstructive lung disease, units that pressure cycled did more harm than good. Pressure cycling also meant that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was impossible to perform if a patient&#x27;s respiration was being supported by one of these units. If chest compressions were to be done, the cycle would be retarded and the resuscitator would be unable to provide oxygen as long as the chest was being compressed. For victims of smoke inhalation and drowning, however, the benefits outweighed the negatives, so these units found a home on ambulances around the world. The devices that cycled on the basis of upper and lower pressure limits are known as pressure cycled automatic resuscitators. In the UK the introduction of BS6850:1987 Ventilatory Resuscitators confirmed that &quot;...automatic pressure-cycled gas-powered resuscitators are not considered suitable for such use (closed chest cardiac compression)...&quot; and confirmed the standards required for gas powered resuscitators and operator powered resuscitators. The following year a similar ISO standard was introduced. Around this date most manufacturers supplied or introduced time - volume cycled resuscitators and pressure cycled devices were discontinued.

Both the Pulmotor and the Emerson depended to a large extent upon the patient&#x27;s ability to breathe the oxygen in order to be beneficial. Due to the limitations imposed by the cycling feature, this meant that patients in need of rescue breathing benefited little from the application of these devices. The Emerson and Pulmotor were utilized until the mid-1960s, when a breakthrough in the history of oxygen delivery was made: the demand valve.

The first appearance of the expired air resuscitator type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957.

The demand valve was a revolutionary new piece of equipment. At the push of a button, high-flow oxygen could be delivered into the lungs of the patient without the complication of the device cycling and, the associated chance of ceasing to administer oxygen. Any amount of pressure that might be required to inflate the lungs could be achieved, and the demand valve was better able to detect obstructions in the lungs and more able to &quot;work with the patient&quot; than the Emerson and Pulmotor could. The demand valve could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress. Conserving the often limited reserves of oxygen was easier with a demand valve, as oxygen was designed only to flow when either the button was depressed or the casualty inhaled. Later medical opinion decided that getting high flow oxygen into a patient&#x27;s airway was a factor in causing vomiting and aspiration. Demand valve resuscitators were introduced with restrictors to limit flow rates to 40 lpm. Use of the demand valve resuscitator in Europe was limited by the lack of pressure relief valve or audible alarm for high pressure.

One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box.

== Modern day ==
The ambu-bag was a further advancement in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve as the primary method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60 cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a &quot;pop-off&quot; valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally more common in the pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.

Newer products have been developed and are available. In 1992 the Genesis(R) II time/volume cycled resuscitator (now upgraded to meet the current, international, resuscitation guidelines and called the CAREvent(R) ALS and CA)provide the SIMV automatic ventilation mode with demand breathing for the spontaneously breathing patient. These devices work like full blown transport ventilators yet are simple enough to operate that they can be used in an emergency situation by pre-hospital healthcare providers and are small enough to be easily transportable. Having a manual override control for use during mask CPR they meet the requirements of the current resuscitation standards. The Oxylator (R) EM-100 introduced in the late 1990s and subsequently replaced by the more flexible Oxylator (R) EMX and HD are pressure cycled devices that utilize pressure, rather than time, cycling to ventilate the patient. 
More recently the microVENT resuscitator range introduced two new models, the microVENT(R) CPR and the microVENT(R)World. These two new time/volume resuscitators meet the latest requirements for resuscitation and are claimed to be lighter and smaller than most similar products. 

Most established automatic resuscitator manufacturers developed time/volume cycled resuscitators as these are acknowledged as preferable to pressure cycled resuscitators.

== Response considerations ==
A manual resuscitator should be used on a victim only in an environment where the air is unquestionably safe to breathe.

<text>Wilfred Arthur Charles Carter (December 18, 1904 – December 5, 1996), professionally known as Wilf Carter in his native Canada and also as Montana Slim in the United States, was a Canadian Country and Western singer, songwriter, guitarist, and yodeller. He wrote over 500 songs.

In 1971, Wilf Carter was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Widely acknowledged as the father of Canadian country music, Carter was Canada&#x27;s first country music star, inspiring a generation of young Canadian performers.

== Early years ==

Carter was born in Port Hilford, Nova Scotia, Canada. One of nine children, his father was Swiss. He began working odd jobs by the age of eight in Canning, Nova Scotia. He began singing after seeing a traveling Swiss performer named &quot;The Yodelling Fool&quot; in Canning. Carter left home at the age of 15 after a falling out with his father, who was a Baptist minister.

In 1923, at age 18, after working as a lumberjack and singing with hobos in boxcars, Carter moved west to Calgary, Alberta, where he became friends with Pete Knight and found work on the Davis ranch, near Brooks, as a cowboy. (In 1979, Carter was the grand marshal at the Calgary Stampede.) He made extra money singing and playing his guitar at dances, performing for tourist parties, and traveling throughout the Canadian Rockies. It was during this time that he developed his own yodelling style, sometimes called an &quot;echo yodel&quot; or a &quot;three-in-one&quot;.

== Radio years (1930–1940)==
Carter performed his first radio broadcast on CFCN Alberta in 1930. Soon after, he was heard locally on CFAC and nationally on the CRBC. Two years later, he was entertaining tourists as a trail rider for the Canadian Pacific Railway, who promoted horseback excursions into the Canadian Rockies. Carter soon became very popular in the region.

In 1933, he was hired as an entertainer on the maiden voyage of the British ship S.S. &quot;Empress&quot;. Later that year, he stopped off in Montreal and made his first recording: &quot;My Swiss Moonlight Lullaby&quot; and &quot;The Capture of Albert Johnson&quot;. After signing with the Canadian branch of RCA Victor, &quot;My Swiss Moonlight Lullaby&quot; became the first hit record ever by a Canadian country performer. That same year, Carter also wrote and recorded &quot;Pete Knight, The King of the Cowboys,&quot; which also became a hit.

For seven years (1934-1940) he hosted his own CBS country music radio program in New York City. His announcer was Bert Parks. CBS changed his the name to &quot;Montana Slim,&quot; to appeal to American audiences. In 1935, Carter also performed on WABC radio. In 1937, Carter returned to Alberta, where he purchased a ranch. He continued to appear on CBC, NBC, and CBS until CBS dropped him in 1940.

In 1940, Carter seriously injured his back in a car accident in Montana. He was unable to perform for much of the decade, but his popularity was sustained by the periodic release of new recordings.

== Recording sessions ==

He had a recording contract with RCA-Victor for five years (1947-1952) and then moved to Nashville where he recorded with Decca from 1954 to 1957.

He sold his ranch in 1949 and moved his family to a farm in New Jersey.

== Touring (1949–1985) ==

In 1949, Carter resumed live performances with tours in Canada and the United States. In 1950, he attracted over 50,000 people during a week at the Canadian National Exhibition bandstand in Toronto, Ontario.

In 1953, Wilf Carter started touring with his own show called, &#x27;The Family Show with the Folks You Know.&#x27; His daughters, Carol and Sheila, worked with him as dancers and back-up singers.

In 1964, Carter performed for the first time at the Calgary Stampede. He also became one of the most requested guests on the TV show hosted by Canadian country singer Tommy Hunter.

In the 1960s and 70s he toured with Hank Snow.

In 1980, Country Music Queen Kitty Wells and her husband Johnnie Wright encouraged Carter to tour with them, which was billed as Carter&#x27;s 80th Birthday Tour. From 1980 to 1985 he toured different parts of Canada.

In 1985, Carter toured with Slim Whitman.

== Recordings ==

Wilf Carter recorded over 40 original and compilation LP records for RCA Victor including &quot;Nuggets of the Golden West&quot;, &quot;Christmas in Canada&quot;, &quot;Songs of the Rail and Range&quot;, &quot;Songs of Australia&quot;, &quot;Wilf Carter Sings Jimmie Rogers&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Back to the Bible&quot;. In 1983, he re-recorded many of his most popular songs for &quot;Fifty Golden Years&quot;.

In 1988, Carter recorded his last album, &quot;What Ever Happened to All Those Years&quot;. In 1991, at age 86, he made his last concert tour, appropriately called &#x27;The Last Round-up Tour&#x27;, with shows throughout Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Manitoba. He retired the following year, due to his loss of hearing. Wilf Carter died in 1996 in Scottsdale, Arizona, 13 days before his 92nd birthday.

== Business ==
In 1952, he moved, this time to Orlando, Florida, where he opened the Wilf Carter Motor Lodge, a venture that lasted only two years.

== Honours and awards ==
In 1971, Wilf Carter was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

He was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1984, and the following year, he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Juno Awards Hall of Fame.

He was made an Honorary Chief of the Stony Indian tribe.

A video documentary was released in 2000, called &quot;The Last Round-up: The Wilf Carter Story&quot;, which examined Carter&#x27;s distinguished career.

== Legacy ==

He wrote hundreds of songs covering a wide range of themes, including traditional country western, cowboy, folk, and hobo songs. His recordings of &quot;Blue Canadian Rockies&quot; and &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; are among the most popular. Fellow Canadian country artist Ian Tyson considers Carter an influence on his music. Another Canadian artist, Stu Davis, acknowledged the importance of Carter&#x27;s mentorship early in his career and credited him with securing Davis&#x27;s first recording contract with Sonora Records in New York.

<text>Stanton Frederick Kalk (14 October 1894 – 6 December 1917) was an officer in the United States Navy during World War I. He received the Navy&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal for his actions after his ship was torpedoed by a German submarine.

==Biography==
Stanton Kalk was born in Mobile County, Alabama, the son of Frank Kalk and Flora &quot;Stanton&quot; Kalk. He was appointed to the Naval Academy by Nebraska Senator Norris Brown, and graduated in 1916, fifty-first in a class of 178.

After serving on the battleship , he was assigned to the destroyer on 10 September 1917. While steaming on patrol duty from Brest, France, to Queenstown, Ireland, &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; was attacked on 6 December by German submarine &quot;U-53&quot;. Although Kalk, officer-of-the-deck during the attack, &quot;took correct and especially prompt measures in maneuvering to avoid the torpedo,&quot; the destroyer could not turn in time to escape. She sank stern first in eight minutes. Though stunned by the explosion and weakened by his action after the ship went down, Kalk swam from one raft to another in an attempt to equalize weight on them. Displaying &quot;extraordinary heroism,&quot; he disregarded his own condition while endeavoring to save the lives of his men. Game to the last, Kalk overtaxed his own strength; he died from exposure and exhaustion.

For his &quot;splendid self-sacrifice&quot; Lt. (j.g.) Kalk was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

==Namesakes==
Two destroyers, and , were named for him.

<doc id="1131719" wikidata="Q4910955" url="?curid=1131719" title="Bill Speakman">
<text>William Speakman-Pitt, VC (21 September 1927 – 20 June 2018), known as Bill Speakman, was a British Army soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first person to receive an honour from Queen Elizabeth II.

==Military career==
Speakman was born and brought up in Altrincham, Cheshire, and educated at Wellington Road School, Timperley. 

He was 24 years old and a private in the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), British Army, attached to the 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers during the Korean War when the following deed took place at United Hill, for which he was awarded the VC. At dusk on 4 November 1951, during the Second Battle of Maryang-san, on the ridge known as Hill 217 in Marysang-san, the section holding the left shoulder of the company&#x27;s position had been seriously depleted by casualties and was being overrun by the enemy. Speakman, on his own initiative, filled his pockets with grenades and went forward, pelting the Chinese with them. Having thrown all of the grenades he had, he returned for more. Inspired by his actions, six men joined him in collecting a pile of grenades and followed him in a series of charges. He broke up several enemy attacks, causing heavy casualties and, despite being wounded in the leg and the shoulder, continued to lead charge after charge. When they ran low on ammunition, they had to resort to throwing stones and ration tins and, according to legend, beer bottles. The enemy was kept at bay long enough to enable his company to withdraw safely. The press nicknamed him the &#x27;beer-bottle VC,&#x27; something he disliked for fear that it suggested he and his colleagues drank beer while on duty; the beer was in fact used to cool gun barrels.

Although his award was made by King George VI, Speakman was the first VC invested by Queen Elizabeth II. 

Whilst serving in Malaya (with the Special Air Service), Borneo and Radfan, he was promoted to sergeant. In Malaya, he was involved in finding and returning the bodies of two soldiers killed in a clash with communist insurgents in the jungle.

Standing tall, he was nicknamed &quot;Big Bill&quot;.

==Later life==
Due to financial hardship, Speakman sold his original VC, using the money to put a new roof on his cottage, but later bought a replacement to wear. His Victoria Cross is displayed in the National War Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh Castle. He was interviewed for the 2006 television docudrama &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot;, which also included archive footage and dramatisations of his actions.

In a ceremony held in Seoul on 21 April 2015 for visiting veterans of the Korean War, Speakman gave a replica of his Victoria Cross and other medals to the people and government of South Korea. He became an in-pensioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, and died on 20 June 2018. His ashes were buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, South Korea on 19 February 2019.

<text>Fallopia convolvulus, the black-bindweed or wild buckwheat, is a fast-growing annual flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae native throughout Europe, Asia and northern Africa.

Synonyms include &quot;Polygonum convolvulus&quot; L. (basionym), &quot;Bilderdykia convolvulus&quot; (L.) Dumort, &quot;Fagopyrum convolvulus&quot; (L.) H.Gross, &quot;Fagopyrum carinatum&quot; Moench, &quot;Helxine convolvulus&quot; (L.) Raf., &quot;Reynoutria convolvulus&quot; (L.) Shinners, and &quot;Tiniaria convolvulus&quot; (L.) Webb &amp; Moq. Other old folk names include bear-bind, bind-corn, climbing bindweed, climbing buckwheat, corn-bind, corn bindweed, devil&#x27;s tether, and wild buckwheat.

==Description==
Black-bindweed is a herbaceous vine growing to long, with stems that twine clockwise round other plant stems. The alternate triangular leaves are 1.5–6 cm long and 0.7–3 cm broad with a 6–15 (–50) mm petiole; the basal lobes of the leaves are pointed at the petiole. The flowers are small, and greenish-pink to greenish white, clustered on short racemes. These clusters give way to small triangular achenes, with one seed in each achene. The flowers have 5 sepals, the 3 outer ones are larger and show a keel. It has 5 stamens and the fruit grows to 4 mm long.

While it superficially resemble bindweeds in the genus &quot;Convolvulus&quot; there are many notable differences; it has ocrea (stipule-sheath at nodes), which &quot;Convolvulus&quot; does not; and &quot;Convolvulus&quot; has conspicuous trumpet-shaped flowers while Black-bindweed has flowers that are unobtrusive and only about 4 mm long.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Fallopia convolvulus&quot; grows most commonly on disturbed or cultivated land, in northern Europe typically on warm, sunny, well-drained sandy or limestone soil types, but in hotter, drier areas like Pakistan, on moist shady sites. It ranges from sea level in the north of its range, up to 3600 m altitude in the south in the Himalaya.

==Cultivation and uses==
The seeds are edible, and were used in the past as a food crop, with remains found in Bronze Age middens. The seeds are too small and low-yielding to make a commercial crop, and it is now more widely considered a weed, occurring in crops, waste areas and roadsides. It can be a damaging weed when it is growing in a garden or crop, as it can not only damage the plants around which it twines, but also clog the machinery used to harvest a given crop. It is also an invasive species in North America.

<doc id="1131721" wikidata="Q239277" url="?curid=1131721" title="Neutron flux">
<text>The neutron flux is a scalar quantity used in nuclear physics and nuclear reactor physics. It is the total distance travelled by all free neutrons per unit time and volume. Equivalently, it can be defined as the number of neutrons travelling through a small sphere of radius formula_1 in a time interval, divided by a maximal cross section of the sphere (the great disk area, formula_2) and by the duration of the time interval. The dimension of neutron flux is formula_3 and the usual unit is cm−2s−1 (reciprocal square centimetre times reciprocal second).

The neutron fluence is defined as the neutron flux integrated over a certain time period. So its dimension is formula_4 and its usual unit is cm−2 (reciprocal square centimetre). An older term used instead of cm−2 was &quot;n.v.t.&quot; (neutrons, velocity, time).

==Natural neutron flux==
Neutron flux in asymptotic giant branch stars and in supernovae is responsible for most of the natural nucleosynthesis producing elements heavier than iron. In stars there is a relatively low neutron flux on the order of 105 to 1011 cm−2 s−1, resulting in nucleosynthesis by the s-process (slow neutron-capture process). By contrast, after a core-collapse supernova, there is an extremely high neutron flux, on the order of 1032 cm−2 s−1, resulting in nucleosynthesis by the r-process (rapid neutron-capture process).

Earth atmospheric neutron flux, apparently from thunderstorms, can reach levels of 3·10−2 to 9·10+1 cm−2 s−1. However, recent results (considered invalid by the original investigators) obtained with unshielded scintillation neutron detectors show a decrease in the neutron flux during thunderstorms. Recent research appears to support lightning generating 1013–1015 neutrons per discharge via photonuclear processes.

==Artificial neutron flux==
Artificial neutron flux refers to neutron flux which is man-made, either as byproducts from weapons or nuclear energy production or for a specific application such as from a research reactor or by spallation. A flow of neutrons is often used to initiate the fission of unstable large nuclei. The additional neutron(s) may cause the nucleus to become unstable, causing it to decay (split) to form more stable products. This effect is essential in fission reactors and nuclear weapons.

Within a nuclear fission reactor, the neutron flux is the primary quantity measured to control the reaction inside. The flux shape is the term applied to the density or relative strength of the flux as it moves around the reactor. Typically the strongest neutron flux occurs in the middle of the reactor core, becoming lower toward the edges. The higher the neutron flux the greater the chance of a nuclear reaction occurring as there are more neutrons going through an area per unit time.

=== Reactor vessel wall neutron fluence ===
A reactor vessel of a typical nuclear power plant (PWR) endures in 40 years (32 full reactor years) of operation approximately 6.5×1019 cm−2 (&quot;E&quot; &gt; 1 MeV) of neutron fluence. Neutron flux causes reactor vessels to suffer from neutron embrittlement and is a major problem with thermonuclear fusion like ITER and other magnetic confinement D-T reactors where fast (originally 14.06 MeV) neutrons damage equipment resulting in short equipment lifetime and huge costs and large volumes of radioactive waste streams.

<doc id="1131722" wikidata="Q7969271" url="?curid=1131722" title="Wareham Forest">
<text>Wareham Forest is an area of countryside in Dorset, England, consisting of open heathland, including Decoy Heath and Gore Heath, and plantations of conifers such as Morden Heath and Bloxworth Heath. The site is managed by Forestry England for conservation and recreation. Situated next to the A35 road between Dorchester and Poole; the forest provides a home for sika deer, the Dartford warbler and a population of sand lizards.

==History==
Wareham Forest featured in the American magazine &quot;Life&quot; on 20 October 1947.
The article describes a fire that raged for four days across Wareham Heath in the summer of that year. The fire severed the road from Wareham to Bere Regis and exploded ammunition left behind from Second World War troop manoeuvres. 
The photograph accompanying the &quot;Life&quot; piece shows fire-fighters trying to counteract the blaze, which saw flames leap to over 150 feet in height.
Thanks to these efforts, a majority of the forest was saved.
A 55-acre tourist park and campsite now makes up part of Wareham Forest. 
In 2012, a married couple walking their dog over the heath had to be rescued by the Dorset Fire and Rescue Service, after they became stuck in a freezing swamp. In May 2020, a large-scale fire, the Wareham Forest fire, was believed to have been started by a disposable barbecue or camp fire and worsened by warm, dry conditions. The fire left 550 acres (220 hectares) of the forest damaged.

==Ecosystem==
A track that passes through the site comprises part of the &#x27;Wareham Forest Way&#x27;, a walk that leads from Wareham to Sturminster Marshall. There is also a route for cyclists called the Sika Cycle Trail. 
Situated to the east of the forest is Morden Bog National Nature Reserve. 
&quot;Calluna&quot; (or heather) and grasses such as &quot;Molinia caerulea&quot; (or purple moor grass) grow readily at Wareham Forest, give grazing fodder to a population of sika. 
The nationally scarce Dartford warbler and the nightjar has been observed around here, and sand lizards may also be spotted. The iconic fly agaric (&quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;), hallucinogenic toadstool, has been recorded within the forest. In 2006 the Journal of Zoology published the results of a nine-year study that looked into the breeding frequency of the site&#x27;s smooth snakes (&quot;Coronella austriaca&quot;).

==In fiction==
The forest provides a backdrop for scenes within R. Hyslop&#x27;s &quot;Wolf&#x27;s-Head&quot; novel, set in the time of Æthelwulf of Wessex.

<text>The North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests is a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of southwestern India.

==Geography==
The North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests lies in the northern portion of the Western Ghats (Sahyadri) range. It extends from southeastern Gujarat through Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka. It covers the eastern and western slopes of the range between 250 and 1000 meters elevation, and surrounds the North Western Ghats montane rain forests ecoregion, which lies above 1000 meters elevation. The ecoregion has an area of . It is bounded on the west by the Malabar Coast moist forests ecoregion, which lies between the 250 meter elevation and the Arabian Sea. At its northern end, the ecoregion extends to the Narmada River, and borders the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests to the northwest and the Narmada Valley dry deciduous forests to the northeast. The Wayanad forests at the southern end of the ecoregion mark the transition to the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests further the south. 

To the east, in the dry rain shadow of the Ghats, are the Deccan thorn scrub forests and the South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests ecoregions, which cover the Ghats&#x27; eastern foothills and the Deccan Plateau.

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that 2,375 km2, or 5%, of the ecoregion was in protected areas. Another 15% is forested but outside protected areas. A 1997 assessment identified thirteen protected areas in the ecoregion, with a combined area of approximately 2,200 km².

* Anshi National Park, Karnataka (280 km²; also extends into the North Western Ghats montane rain forests)
* Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (330 km², also extends into the North Western Ghats montane rain forests)

<doc id="1131728" wikidata="Q6516828" url="?curid=1131728" title="Left Coast">
<text>Left Coast is a political expression that implies that the West Coast of the United States leans politically to the left. The implication is that with the exception of Alaska, the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii tend to vote for the Democratic Party, particularly in Coastal California, the Eugene and Portland metropolitan areas in Oregon, the Puget Sound region in Washington, and most of Hawaii. It also suggests that most people who live in the West Coast region have a generally more liberal or progressive attitude than the rest of the country. The phrase plays on the fact that the West Coast is on the left of the United States when viewing a map with north oriented at the top. The term also applies to British Columbia&#x27;s place in Canada, for the same reasons.

In the United States, the expression is used pejoratively by right-leaning people, but proudly by people on the left. Conservative NewsMax columnist James Hirsen writes the &quot;Left Coast Report&quot;, which puts down Hollywood celebrities and their scandals as well as providing conservative political commentary. He has also written a book, &quot;Tales from the Left Coast: True Stories of Hollywood Stars and Their Outrageous Politics&quot;. On the other side, the term is used by cartoonist Ted Rall as the name of his left-leaning political comic strip. Writer, voiceover actor, and gay rights activist Ben Patrick Johnson calls his video blog &quot;Life on the Left Coast&quot;. Fundraiser and CEO of San Francisco-based nonprofit Tides, Drummond Pike, maintains a CEO blog entitled &quot;Notes from the Left Coast&quot;.

== Definitions ==
The term is also used in a neutral or non-political sense. The left coast has by far the most workers in STEM professions and will continue to be a leading tech hub for the United States. The gross product of the left coast was approximately $1.2 trillion.

In Canada, the coastal strip of British Columbia, including Vancouver Island, is also referred to as the Left Coast. The use of the term &quot;left coast&quot; is not usually pejorative. For example, at the investiture to the Order of British Columbia of the painter Edward John Hughes by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, Iona Campagnolo, in April 2006, she stated, &quot;We have all occasionally heard of our beloved coast dismissed as the &#x27;wet coast&#x27;, the &#x27;left&#x27; coast, even the &#x27;rain coast&#x27;, yet for most of us, these are &#x27;terms of endearment&#x27;...&quot;

==History==
Since 1992, the state of California has consistently voted Democratic in presidential elections. In the case of Oregon and Washington, and Hawaii, all three have voted Democratic since the 1988 presidential election.

Virtually no Republicans have statewide office in those states. Oregon and Washington are notable for being especially consistent in electing Democratic governors, and Oregon in particular has the country&#x27;s longest streak of Democratic governors. Additionally, in the 2022 House of Representatives elections, all congressional districts directly bordering the Pacific Ocean (including Alaska and Hawaii) were won by Democrats.

Similarly in Canada, the coastal parts of British Columbia votes consistently for left leaning Members of Parliament such as Liberals and New Democrats, and for New Democrats as well as Greens provincially, though with some exceptions.

<text>The Lake View and Collamer Railroad opened on May 1, 1875, on the east side of Cleveland.

The railroad extended from near the intersection of Becker Avenue and Superior Street, where it connected to the Superior Street Railway, in Cleveland to Euclid Village, a distance of 6.86 miles. About 2.5 miles of the Lake View and Collamer Railroad was inside the city of Cleveland where it ran parallel to and a short distance north of Superior Street. The remainder of the railroad ran north-east to Euclid, parallel to Euclid Avenue.

==History==
In August 1879 the Lake View and Collamer Railroad was sold at foreclosure sale and then operated as the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (not to be confused with the older railroad of the same name). The New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Nickel Plate) acquired control in 1882, and the part parallel to Euclid Avenue became part of its main line.

<text>Andrew Hull Foote (September 12, 1806 – June 26, 1863) was an American naval officer who was noted for his service in the American Civil War and also for his contributions to several naval reforms in the years prior to the war. When the war came, he was appointed to command of the Western Gunboat Flotilla, predecessor of the Mississippi River Squadron. In that position, he led the gunboats in the Battle of Fort Henry. For his services with the Western Gunboat Flotilla, Foote was among the first naval officers to be promoted to the then-new rank of rear admiral.

==Early life==
Foote was born at New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Senator Samuel A. Foot (or Foote) and Eudocia Hull. As a child Foote was not known as a good student, but showed a keen interest in one day going to sea. His father compromised and had him entered at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Six months later in 1822, he left West Point and accepted an appointment as a midshipman in the United States Navy.

==Antebellum naval service==
Between 1822 and 1843, Foote saw service in the Caribbean, Pacific, and Mediterranean, African Coast and at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. He first began as a midshipman on . In 1830, he was commissioned a lieutenant, and was stationed in the Mediterranean. In 1837, Foote circumnavigated the globe in . After serving on sea, Foote was put in charge of the Philadelphia Naval Asylum. After serving on land he went back to sea, and organized a Temperance Society aboard . This group developed into a movement that resulted in ending the policy of supplying grog to U.S. Naval personnel.

From 1849 to 1851, Foote commanded , cruising the waters off the African coast. He was active in suppressing the slave trade there. This experience persuaded him to support the cause of abolition, and in 1854, he published a 390-page book, &quot;Africa and the American Flag.&quot; In this book, Admiral Foote described the geography of the African continent, the customs of many of the African people, the establishment of American colonies in Africa, the slave-trade and its evils and the need to protect American citizens and commerce abroad. He also became a frequent speaker on the Abolitionist circuit.

Foote was promoted to Commander in 1856, and took command of in the East India Squadron. With this command, Foote was assigned the mission of observing British operations against Canton, China, during the Second Opium War. This eventually resulted in his being attacked from Chinese shore batteries. Foote led a landing party that seized the barrier forts along the Pearl River in reprisal for the attack. This led to a short occupation by the U.S. Navy of Chinese territory.

Foote returned to the Continental United States in 1858, and took command of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, in Brooklyn, New York, a post he held until the outbreak of the hostilities of the Civil War.

==Personal life and family==

As the Civil War began, Foote wrote a letter (see image) to his three youngest children on August 31, 1861. In it he expresses his love for them and the fact that he is going to war and may be killed. He closes with the phrase &quot;God grant that you all may at last rest in heaven my dear children, is the prayer of your affectionate father.&quot; 1862 was a time of great personal loss for Foote. Seven months after this letter was written, his son William Leffingwell died March 14, 1862, at the age of 13. Later that year, his daughter Emily Frederica died at age 10 on October 14. Six days later, his youngest daughter Maria Eudocia died at age 7. Foote and his wife Caroline Augusta Street Foote had lost three children in 7 months. When Foote died in 1863, he left behind two sons, Augustus Russell Street (age 16) and John Samuel, and one adult daughter, Josephine, from his first marriage to Caroline Flagg. Caroline Augusta Street died two months after Foote on August 27, 1863. Youngest son John Samuel, nicknamed &quot;Admiral Byng&quot; by Foote, was orphaned at age four.

==Civil War and death==


When the American Civil War began in 1861, Foote was in command of the New York Navy Yard. On June 29, 1861, Foote was promoted to captain. From 1861 to 1862, Foote commanded the Mississippi River Squadron with distinction, organizing and leading the gunboat flotilla in many of the early battles of the Western Theater of the American Civil War. Even though Foote was an officer in the United States Navy, the Western Flotilla was under the jurisdiction of the Union Army. In early February 1862, now holding the rank of flag officer (equivalent to the modern commodore), he cooperated with General Ulysses S. Grant against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. Despite heavy damage to one of the gunboats, Foote was able to quickly subdue the fort. When the Confederate garrison commander, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, sent out a flag of truce asking the terms of surrender, Foote sent back a blunt reply, “No sir, your surrender will be unconditional!”

Several days later Grant, with three divisions, and Foote with his fleet of ironclads, along with the assistance of Captain Seth Ledyard Phelps and his fleet of timberclad warships, moved against Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River. Hoping for a repeat of the success at Fort Henry, General Grant urged Foote to attack the fort&#x27;s river batteries. Fort Donelson&#x27;s guns, however, were better-placed than Fort Henry&#x27;s were. Three of Foote&#x27;s gunboats were damaged including the flagship, USS &quot;St. Louis&quot;. Foote himself received a wound in his foot. For his service at Forts Henry and Donelson, Foote received the Thanks of Congress. After repairing his flotilla, Foote joined with General John Pope in a campaign against Island Number Ten on the Mississippi River. In July 1862 Foote received a second Thanks of Congress, this time for the battles of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson and Island Number Ten.

Later in 1862, Foote was promoted to rear admiral. In 1863, on his way to take command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, he suddenly died, struck down by Bright&#x27;s disease. His untimely death in New York shocked the nation. He was interred at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven.

==Namesakes==
Three ships were named USS &quot;Foote&quot; for him. Civil War Fort Foote on the Potomac, now a National Park, was named for him on September 17, 1863.

Foote Street NE (and Foote Place) in Washington, DC is named for him, part of a series of streets named for Civil War generals.

<text>William A. T. Maddox (1814 – January 1, 1889) was an officer in the United States Marine Corps.

Born in Charles County, Maryland, in 1814, commanded a volunteer company in the Creek and Seminole Wars in 1836, and was appointed 2nd lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 14, 1837.

On September 12, 1846, while serving in the Mexican–American War, Lieutenant Maddox was appointed by Commodore Robert F. Stockton (commander of all US forces in California at the time) to be Military Commandant of the Middle District of California (one of three districts set up by Stockton).

The next year, he was breveted captain for &quot;gallant and meritorious conduct&quot; during a Mexican uprising at Monterey and during the Battle of Santa Clara, California, January 3, 1847. Monterey was within the Middle District, while Santa Clara was in the Northern District.

Captain Maddox retired in 1880 and died in Washington, D.C.

== Namesake ==
Three ships, USS &quot;Maddox&quot;, have been named for him.

<doc id="1131745" wikidata="Q3410916" url="?curid=1131745" title="Purdey (The New Avengers)">
<text>Purdey is a fictional character in the British TV series &quot;The New Avengers&quot; played by Joanna Lumley from 1976 to 1977. She was a spy working for British intelligence, partnered with John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt).

==Character history==
When Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell first mapped out the characters for &quot;The New Avengers&quot; - an updating of &quot;The Avengers&quot; - the female lead character was to have been named Charlie (or Charley), but the decision was made not to use the name. Lumley is credited with suggesting the character be named Purdey, after James Purdey and Sons, a famous shotgun manufacturer. Lumley also chose the character&#x27;s distinctive short haircut.

==Character biography==
Purdey is a martial arts expert practicing savate (learned, according to her, during her time with the Royal Ballet, who let her go for being too tall) and (true to her namesake) an expert markswoman, who is often called upon to use her feminine attributes to distract villains. She is a motorcyclist and expert tap-dancer. Purdey saw Steed as an attractive, yet fatherly figure, and there was also ongoing banter and playful flirting between Purdey and Mike Gambit (although the series never indicated anything more in her relationship with either man).

During the two-year run of the series, no other name was ever given to the character and it was never revealed on screen whether Purdey was the character&#x27;s first or last name.

==Reception==
In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 1996 tribute book, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Toby Miller writes: &quot;&quot;The New Avengers&quot; made a very public and lengthy search for a leading woman. Joan Bakewell likened the eventual choice, Lumley as Purdey, to &#x27;a hockey captain attending a royal garden party&#x27;. Richard Afton went far enough to remark that &#x27;sex has taken a long holiday&#x27;, and Lumley looked back on it from the queer/libertarian-feminist credibility of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; to describe her Purdey as &#x27;a huge disappointment, sex-wise&#x27;.&quot;

Writing of Purdey&#x27;s debut, Alan Hayes in &quot;Avenger World: The Avengers in Our Lives&quot; says, &quot;Purdey was certainly no Emma Peel, and her sharp tongue and habit of intentionally making life difficult for Gambit flew in the face of the warm mutual respect between Steed and Peel, so I found that she grated somewhat (my opinion of her would eventually soften considerably).&quot;

<text>The Origins of Virtue is a 1996 popular science book by Matt Ridley, which has been recognised as a classic in its field. In the book, Ridley explores the issues surrounding the development of human morality. The book, written from a sociobiological viewpoint, explores how genetics can be used to explain certain traits of human behaviour, in particular morality and altruism.

Starting from the premise that society can, on a simplistic level, be represented as a variant of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, Ridley examines how it has been possible for a society to arise in which people choose to cooperate with others, rather than &quot;defect&quot; and act purely in their own self-interest.

Ridley examines the history of different attempts to explain the fact that humans in society do not defect, looking at various computer generated models that have been used to explain how such behaviour could arise. In particular, he looks at systems based on the idea of Tit-for-tat, a program developed by Canadian professor Anatol Rapoport, where members of the group only cooperate with those who also cooperate, and exclude those who do not. This results in the optimum solution to the dilemma being to cooperate, allowing altruistic behaviour to develop. He applies this to humans and suggests that genes that generated altruistic, tit-for-tat behaviour would be likely to be passed on and therefore give rise to the kind of behaviour we see in human society.

Ridley then examines the development of tribal mentality, group prejudice, the benefits of trade, and ineffective government regulation.

From this, Ridley argues that society operates best in groups of around 150 individuals, which he suggests is the level at which humans are capable of being sure about which members to cooperate with and which to exclude. Although he avoids drawing any specific political points, Ridley ends his book by arguing for a smaller state operating on a more local level.

<text>Marduk-apla-iddina II (Akkadian: ; in the Bible Merodach-Baladan or Berodach-Baladan, lit. &quot;Marduk has given me an heir&quot;) was a Chaldean leader from the Bit-Yakin tribe, originally established in the territory that once made the Sealand in southern Babylonia. He seized the Babylonian throne in 722 BC from Assyrian control and reigned from 722 BC to 710 BC, and from 703 BC to 702 BC. His reign is defined by some historians as an illegitimate Third Dynasty of the Sealand, inside of the IXth Dynasty of Babylon, or Assyrian Dynasty.

He was known as one of the kings who maintained Babylonian independence in the face of Assyrian military supremacy for more than a decade.

Sargon of Assyria repressed the allies of Marduk-apla-iddina II in Elam, Aram and Israel and eventually drove him from Babylon (). After the death of Sargon, Marduk-apla-iddina II briefly recaptured the throne from a native Babylonian nobleman. He reigned nine months (703–702 BC). He returned from Elam and ignited rebellion in Babylonia. He was able to enter Babylon and be declared king again. Nine months later he was defeated near Kish by Sennacherib and the Assyrians, but managed to flee to Elam. He died in exile a couple of years later.

A cylinder of Marduk-apla-iddina II from Uruk describes his rebuilding of the temple of Ningishzida built by the Ur III ruler Shulgi alongside the ziggurat of E-Anna. The cylinder also claims his victory at the Battle of Der in 720 BC, as did Assyrian king Sargon II and also Elamite king Humban-nikash I.

==In the Bible==
He is mentioned as king of Babylon in the days of King Hezekiah, both in 2 Kings 20:12 (here called Berodach-baladan) and in Isaiah 39:1. In both passages he sends Hezekiah a letter, having heard of his illness and recovery. His messengers who have delivered the letter are lavishly entertained by Hezekiah, leading the prophet Isaiah to criticise Hezekiah for his excessive openness about the wealth he had amassed.

<text>John G. Cowell (18 September 1785 – 18 April 1814) was an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

Born in Marblehead, Massachusetts, Cowell entered the Navy as a master 21 January 1809. As acting lieutenant, Cowell was severely wounded, losing a leg, in the action on 28 March 1814 between USS &quot;Essex&quot; and HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot; and HMS &quot;Cherub&quot; off Valparaíso, Chile. Refusing to be carried below, Cowell cheered his companions on through the remainder of the action. He was carried on shore, and exhibited such gallantry and courage under severe pain until his death on 18 April that the people of Valparaíso honored him with a burial place in their principal church; a most unusual honor for a foreigner.

Two destroyers have been named USS &quot;Cowell&quot; for him.</text><links>

<doc id="1131764" wikidata="Q7568909" url="?curid=1131764" title="South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests">
<text>The South Western Ghats moist deciduous forestsis an ecoregion in the Western Ghats of southern India with tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. This biome covers the Nilgiri Hills between elevation of in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states.

==Geography==
The ecoregion has an area of . It includes the southern ranges of the Western Ghats, including the Agastyamalai and Anamalai, and the eastward spurs or slopes of the Nilgiri Hills and Palani Hills. The forests of Wayanad in northern Kerala mark the transition to the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests to the north. To the west, the Malabar Coast moist forests ecoregion lies in the coastal strip between the 250 meter contour and the Malabar Coast. To the east, the ecoregion transitions to the South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests ecoregion in the drier rain shadow of the Western Ghats. It surrounds the South Western Ghats montane rain forests ecoregion, which lies above 1000 meters elevation.

==Climate==
The climate of the ecoregion is tropical, and varies with elevation and exposure.

The western slopes of the mountains intercept moisture-bearing winds during the June to September southwest monsoon, when 65% to 80% of the annual rainfall occurs. The northeast monsoon brings additional rain between October and November. Evapotranspiration from the forests and moist sea air from the Arabian Sea provide additional humidity. December to May are the driest months. Rainfall on the west side of the range averages 2,000–3,000 mm annually. The eastern slopes are on the rain shadow of the mountains, and rainfall averages 1000 to 2000 mm annually.

Average temperatures are generally cooler than in the adjacent lowlands, and decrease with increasing elevation.

==Flora==
Many forest trees lose their leaves during the dry season. Typical tree species include &quot;Adina cordifolia, Albizia odoratissima, Albizia procera, Alstonia scholaris, Bombax ceiba, Toona ciliata, Dalbergia latifolia, Grewia tiliaefolia, Holoptelea integrifolia, Hymenodictyon excelsum, Lagerstroemia lanceolata, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Lannea coromandelica, Miliusa velutina, Pterocarpus marsupium, Schleichera oleosa, Spondias pinnata, Radermachera xylocarpa, Tectona grandis, Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia paniculata, Terminalia tomentosa, Vitex altissima, Xylia xylocarpa&quot;, and &quot;Machilus macrantha&quot;.

==Fauna==
There are 89 native mammal species in the ecoregion. Larger mammals include the tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;), Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas elephas&quot;), gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;), Nilgiri langur (&quot;Semnopithecus johnii&quot;), dhole or Asian wild dog (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;), and sloth bear (&quot;Melursus ursinus&quot;). Among the smaller mammals are several threatened species, including Jerdon&#x27;s palm civet (&quot;Paradoxurus jerdoni&quot;), Gray slender loris (&quot;Loris lydekkerianus&quot;), grizzled giant squirrel (&quot;Ratufa macroura&quot;), and Indian giant squirrel (&quot;Ratufa indica&quot;). There are no strictly endemic mammals. The ranges of the Nilgiri langur, Jerdon&#x27;s civet, and Malabar large-spotted civet (&quot;Viverra civettina&quot;) extend upwards into the montane rain forests and downwards into the Malabar coastal forests. Day&#x27;s shrew (&quot;Suncus dayi&quot;) is also found in the coastal forests, and Layard&#x27;s striped squirrel (&quot;Funambulus layardi&quot;) extends into the montane rain forests.

The ecoregion has 322 native species of birds. There are nine near-endemic species, which are also found in the adjacent montane rain forests: the Nilgiri wood pigeon (&quot;Columba elphinstonii&quot;), Malabar grey hornbill (&quot;Ocyceros griseus&quot;), grey-headed bulbul (&quot;Brachypodius priocephalus&quot;), rufous babbler (&quot;Argya subrufa&quot;), white-bellied treepie (&quot;Dendrocitta leucogastra&quot;), black-and-rufous flycatcher (&quot;Ficedula nigrorufa&quot;), Nilgiri flycatcher (&quot;Eumyias albicaudata&quot;), yellow-throated bulbul (&quot;Pycnonotus xantholaemus&quot;), and Malabar parakeet (&quot;Psittacula columboides&quot;).

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that 6,645 km², or 28%, of the ecoregion was in protected areas. Another 50% is forested but outside protected areas. In 1997, the World Wildlife Fund identified fourteen protected areas in the ecoregion, with a combined area of approximately 4,960 km², that encompassed 21% of the ecoregion&#x27;s area. The adjacent protected areas of Bandipur, Nagarhole, Mudumalai, and Wyanad are home to India&#x27;s largest protected population of elephants, with over 2500 individuals.

* Bandipur National Park, Karnataka (1,110 km²)
* Bilgiriranga Swamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (370 km², partly in the South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests)
* Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala (50 km²)
* Eravikulam National Park, Kerala (90 km², partly in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests)
* Indira Gandhi National Park (Anamalai), Tamil Nadu (620 km² partly in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests)
* Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, Tamil Nadu (895 km², partly in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests)

* Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala (40 km² partly in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests)
* Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala (430 km²)

In 2000 a portion of The Nilgiris was designated a biosphere reserve under UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Programme. In 2012 a World Heritage Site was designated in the Western Ghats, covering seven groups of protected areas in the range. Four of those areas - Agasthyamalai, Periyar, Anamalai, and Nilgiri – extend through the ecoregion.

<doc id="1131768" wikidata="Q439844" url="?curid=1131768" title="Ithell Colquhoun">
<text>Ithell Colquhoun ( 9 October 1906 – 11 April 1988) was a British painter, occultist, poet and author. Stylistically her artwork was affiliated with Surrealism. In the early 1930s she met André Breton in Paris, and later started working with Surrealist automatism techniques in her writing and painting. In the late 1930s, Colquhoun was part of the British Surrealist Group before being expelled because she refused to renounce her association with occult groups, including the Ordo Templi Orientis and the Fellowship of Isis. Despite her break with the movement, Colquhoun was a lifelong adherent to Surrealism and its automatic techniques. Although initially acclaimed, art historians have noted that Colquhoun&#x27;s reputation suffered during and after World War II when British surrealists such as E. L. T. Mesens pamphleted against her former husband, Toni del Renzio.
==Biography==
Margaret Ithell Colquhoun was born in Shillong, British India, the daughter of Henry Archibald Colebrooke Colquhoun and Georgia Frances Ithell Manley. She was educated in Rodwell, near Weymouth, Dorset, before attending Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College. She became interested in occultism at the age of 17 after reading about Aleister Crowley&#x27;s Abbey of Thelema. Colquhoun studied from 1925 at Cheltenham School of Art for a year. From October 1927 she studied at the Slade School of Art in London, where she was taught by Henry Tonks and Randolph Schwabe. While at the Slade, she joined G.R.S. Mead&#x27;s Quest Society, and in 1930 published her first article, &quot;The Prose of Alchemy&quot;, in the society&#x27;s journal. In 1929, Colquhoun received the Slade&#x27;s Summer Composition Prize for her painting &quot;Judith Showing the Head of Holofernes&quot;, and in 1931 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy. Despite her studies at the Slade, Colquhoun was primarily a self-taught artist.

After leaving the Slade in 1931, Colquhoun spent several years travelling. She established a studio in Paris, where she first encountered Surrealists, including René Magritte, André Breton, Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp, and Man Ray and attended the Académie Colarossi in 1931 where she read Peter Neagoe&#x27;s 1932 essay &quot;What is Surrealism?&quot; During the 1930s she also spent time in Greece, Corsica, and Tenerife. While in Greece, Colquhoun met and became infatuated with a woman, Andromache &quot;Kyria&quot; Kazou, who was the subject of several drawings and paintings and an unpublished manuscript, &quot;Lesbian Shore&quot;. Kazou appears to have visited Colquhoun in Paris and Colquhoun later invited her to move to London so they could live together, though Kazou never did so.

Colquhoun exhibited three paintings in Paris in 1933, and one work at the Royal Society of Scotland in 1934. In 1936, she had her first solo exhibition at the Cheltenham Art Gallery, where she showed 91 works. A solo exhibition at the Fine Art Society in London followed in the same year.
Colquhoun&#x27;s interest in Surrealism deepened after seeing Salvador Dalí lecture at the 1936 &quot;International Exhibition of Surrealism&quot; in London. In 1937 she joined the Artists&#x27; International Association, and in the late 1930s she became increasingly associated with the surrealist movement in Britain. She published work in the &quot;London Bulletin&quot; in 1938 and 1939, visited André Breton in Paris in 1939, and joined the British Surrealist Group in the same year. Also in 1939, she exhibited with Roland Penrose at the Mayor Gallery, showing 14 oil paintings and two objects. After only a year as a member of the British Surrealist Group, Colquhoun was expelled in 1940, due to her refusal to comply with E.L.T. Mesens&#x27; demands that the surrealists should not be members of any other groups, which Colquhoun felt would interfere with her studies of occultism. This led to Colquhoun&#x27;s exclusion from other exhibitions organised by the British surrealists, but she continued to work with surrealist principles.

In the 1940s, Colquhoun met and began a relationship with the Russian-born Italian artist and critic Toni del Renzio. Though he criticised her art as &quot;sterile abstractions&quot; in an essay in his magazine &quot;Arson&quot; in March 1942, he soon moved in with her, and in December that year she exhibited at a show at the International Art Centre in London, organised by del Renzio. They married in 1943. This marriage further alienated her from the British surrealist movement, as del Renzio had his own rivalry with Mesens, due to del Renzio&#x27;s ambition to become the leader of that group. According to Eric Ratcliffe, their studio in Bedford Park, London, became an open house for friends, other artists and like-minded individuals. The marriage later became unhappy and they divorced – &quot;acrimoniously&quot;, according to Matthew Gale – in 1947. From 1945, Colquhoun lived and worked in Parkhill Road, Hampstead.

Colquhoun began to visit Cornwall during the Second World War. From 1947, she rented a studio near Penzance, and divided her time between there and London; in 1959 she moved to Paul, Cornwall. She remained in Cornwall for the rest of her life. After her move to Cornwall, Colquhoun increasingly focused on publishing her writing, and from the 1960s her output of visual art substantially declined in favour of her writing and her occult activities.

She had solo exhibitions in 1947 at the Mayor Gallery, in 1972 at Exeter Museum and Art Gallery, and in 1976 at the Newlyn Orion Gallery. Colquhoun continued making art until around 1983. She spent her final years in a nursing home in Lamorna, where she died in 1988.

Colquhoun left her literary works to the writer Derek Stanford, her occult work to the Tate, and the remainder of her art to the National Trust. The copyright for the works she sold (or gifted) during her lifetime was left to The Samaritans, the Noise Abatement Society, and the Sister Perpetua Wing of St Anthony&#x27;s Hospital, North Cheam. In 2019, the Tate acquired the National Trust&#x27;s holdings of Colquhoun&#x27;s works.

==Art==
Though only formally involved with the Surrealist movement in England for a few years, Colquhoun first gained her reputation as a surrealist, and identified as a surrealist for the rest of her life. She used many automatic techniques, which were described in André Breton&#x27;s first surrealist manifesto as a defining feature of surrealism, and invented several herself.

Colquhoun began to experiment with automatic techniques in 1939, and used a wide range of materials and methods, such as decalcomania, fumage, frottage and collage. She developed new techniques such as superautomatism, stillomancy, parsemage, and entopic graphomania, writing about them in her article &quot;The Mantic Stain&quot;. Automatism continued to be an important part of Colquhoun&#x27;s artistic practice for the rest of her life, and following her split from the British surrealist movement it also became a key part of her spiritual activities. In 1948 she demonstrated automatic techniques on British television, on a BBC programme called &quot;The Eye of the Artist&quot;, and in 1951 she published another article, &quot;Children of the Mantic Stain&quot;.

Colquhoun had an early interest in biology, and studies of plants and flowers were a recurring theme in her art throughout her life. Many of her early notebooks contained very detailed drawings of plants, and her early works included a series of enlarged images of flora, occupying the full canvas and painted almost photographically.

Colquhoun&#x27;s work also often explored themes of sex and gender. Her early work often depicts powerful women from myth and Bible stories, such as &quot;Judith Showing the Head of Holofernes&quot; 1929, and &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; 1930 – both of which are likely homages to Artemisia Gentileschi&#x27;s works on the same themes. Dawn Ades sees Colquhoun&#x27;s treatment of gender as responding to the masculine and patriarchal themes in the art of other surrealists – for instance, where they drew landscapes as women&#x27;s bodies. Colquhoun&#x27;s &quot;Gouffres Amers&quot; 1939 shows a male body as a landscape. Several of her works explore themes of castration and male impotence, including &quot;Gouffres Amers&quot; and &quot;The Pine Family&quot;, while she portrays female sexuality much more positively, such as in &quot;Scylla&quot;. She was also deeply interested in androgyny, particularly in the early 1940s, and produced several works on the theme.

Stylistically, some her works have been described as &quot;macabre&quot; and &quot;sinister&quot;. In 1939, she created the work &quot;Tepid Waters (Rivières Tièdes)&quot; which was displayed at her solo exhibition at the Mayor Gallery the same year. The painting, based on a church in Corsica, may allude to the Spanish Civil War.

In the 1940s, Colquhoun began to create works exploring the themes of consciousness and the subconscious. Her interest in psychology and dreams also attached her to the Surrealist movement. Three works which stand out during the 1940s are &quot;The Pine Family&quot;, which deals with dismemberment and castration, &quot;A Visitation&quot; which shows a flat heart-shape with multi-coloured beams of light and &quot;Dreaming Leaps&quot;, an homage to Sonia Araquistain, the 24-year-old daughter of the ambassador of the ex-Second Spanish Republic in London who committed suicide by jumping nude from the top of a building.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Colquhoun turned her attention towards collages rather than painting. The last retrospective of her work was held at the Newlyn Orion Gallery in 1976, which showed a large number of collages, many of which were inspired by the collages of Kurt Schwitters.

== Writing ==
Along with her visual art, Colquhoun was a prolific writer, producing works including poetry, essays, novels, and travel guides. From the 1950s, Colquhoun&#x27;s output as a visual artist decreased, and she increasingly focused on her poetry and essay writing.

Colquhoun published her first article, &quot;The Prose of Alchemy&quot;, in 1930. In 1939, she published several pieces of short fiction in the &quot;London Bulletin&quot;, along with an essay, &quot;What Do I Need to Paint a Picture?&quot;. In the 1940s she continued to publish short works in anthologies such as &quot;New Road: New Directions in Art and Writing&quot; and &quot;The Fortune Anthology&quot;, and organised surrealist poetry readings with del Renzio. During this period, her writing was influenced by the New Apocalypse literary movement, as well as the Mass Observation project. She wrote articles on automatism: &quot;The Mantic Stain&quot; – which she claimed was the first English-language essay on surrealist automatism – in 1949, &quot;Children of the Mantic Stain&quot; in 1951, and &quot;Notes on Automatism&quot; in 1980. Later in life she contributed articles to surrealist revival journals.

Colquhoun wrote three travel books: &quot;The Crying of the Wind&quot; and &quot;Living Stones&quot;, about Ireland and Cornwall respectively, were published in the 1950s; a third book on Egypt, begun in the 1960s, was never published. In 1975 she published &quot;The Sword of Wisdom&quot;, a biography of Samuel MacGregor Mathers. She also published a novel, &quot;The Goose of Hermogenes&quot;, which was largely written by automatic processes. The novel tells the story of a girl lured to an island by her uncle to help him in his search for the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. Colquhoun wrote two more surrealist gothic novels, &quot;I Saw Water&quot; and &quot;Destination Limbo&quot;, neither of which was published in her lifetime; &quot;I Saw Water&quot; was published in 2014 and &quot;Destination Limbo&quot; in 2021. She also published two volumes of poetry during her lifetime. &quot;Grimoire of the Entangled Thicket&quot; was a short poetry book inspired by the Tree of Life in 1973, and &quot;Osmazone&quot;, published in 1983, was an anthology of prose poems, many from much earlier in her life.

==Reception and legacy==
Colquhoun gained an early reputation within the British Surrealist movement, though in later years she became better known as an occultist. Although her work has largely been discussed in terms of its connection to Surrealism, Colquhoun sometimes stated her independence from the movement. In 1939, the same year she joined the English Surrealist group, she described herself as an &#x27;independent artist&#x27; in a review for the &quot;London Bulletin&quot;.

Though Colquhoun was a relatively unknown artist by her death in 1988 compared to other women surrealists such as Eileen Agar and Dorothea Tanning, more recently there has been renewed interest in her work from feminist and esoteric viewpoints. In 2012, the scholar Amy Hale noted that Colquhoun &quot;is becoming recognized as one of the most interesting and prolific esoteric thinkers and artists of the twentieth century&quot;.
Hale argued that through Colquhoun&#x27;s work &quot;we can see an interplay of themes and movements which characterizes the trajectory of certain British subcultures ranging from Surrealism to the Earth Mysteries movement and also gives us a rare insight into the thoughts and processes of a working magician&quot;.

In 2020, Colquhoun&#x27;s work featured in the &quot;British Surrealism&quot; exhibition at the Dulwich Picture Gallery. In 2021, it was featured in the &quot;Phantoms of Surrealism&quot; show at Whitechapel Art Gallery, the &quot;Unsettling Landscapes&quot; exhibition at St Barbe Museum &amp; Art Gallery, and was the focus of an exhibition at Unit London, &quot;Song of Songs&quot;.

<text>Robiquetia minimiflora, or the tiny-flowered abdominea, is a very rare monopodial epiphytic orchid species. It was previously known as the Abdominea minimiflora. It is distributed from Thailand to the Malay Peninsula, Java, and the Philippines.

The name is derived from the Latin &quot;abdomen&quot;, meaning belly. It refers to the similarity between the shape of the labellum (lip) and the shape of the abdomen of an insect.

The species produces very small flowers, about 0.45 cm wide, on a racemose, many-flowered inflorescence.

<text>Logres (among various other forms and spellings) is King Arthur&#x27;s realm in the Matter of Britain. The geographical area referred to by the name is south and eastern England. However, Arthurian writers such as Chrétien de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach have differed in their interpretations of this. 
==Etymology==
It derives from the medieval Welsh word &quot;Lloegyr&quot;, a name of uncertain origin referring to South and Eastern England (&quot;Lloegr&quot; is modern Welsh for all of England).

==Geographical area in various Arthurian works==
In Arthurian contexts, &quot;Logres&quot; is often used to describe the Brittonic territory roughly corresponding to the borders of England before the area was taken by the Anglo-Saxons. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s influential but largely fictional history &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, the realm was named after the legendary king Locrinus, the oldest son of Brutus of Troy. In his &quot;Historia&quot;, Geoffrey uses the word &quot;Loegria&quot; to describe a province containing most of England excluding Cornwall and possibly Northumberland, as in this example from section iv.20 (from the Penguin Classics translation by Lewis Thorpe):

It was described by Chrétien de Troyes as &quot;The Land of Ogres&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;Ogres&quot;) in his poem &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;. In various French works, Logres appears as the name of the land or the capital city (otherwise Camelot), its inhabitants can be known as either Loegrwys or Lloegrwys. Translating and compiling such texts for his &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Thomas Malory conflated Logres with his contemporary Kingdom of England and usually used just &quot;England&quot; instead, except for the names of some of the Knights of the Round Table. In some medieval German works, Logres is the personal domain of Gawain, as established by Wolfram von Eschenbach.
==Use in modern fiction==
The name &quot;Logres&quot; is also used in several works of modern fantasy set in Britain, for example, C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; and Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;, and Charles Williams, &quot;Taliessin through Logres&quot;.

<doc id="1131780" wikidata="Q202350" url="?curid=1131780" title="Alberto Gonzales">
<text>Alberto R. Gonzales (born August 4, 1955) is an American lawyer who served as the 80th United States Attorney General from 2005 to 2007 and was the highest-ranking Hispanic American in executive government in American history until the appointment of Marco Rubio as Secretary of State in 2025. He previously served as Secretary of State of Texas, as a Texas Supreme Court Justice, and as White House Counsel, becoming the first Hispanic to hold that office.

Gonzales&#x27;s tenure as U.S. Attorney General was marked by controversy regarding warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens and the legal authorization of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;, later generally acknowledged as constituting torture, in the U.S. government&#x27;s post-9/11 &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Gonzales had also presided over the firings of several U.S. Attorneys who had refused back-channel White House directives to prosecute political enemies, allegedly causing the office of Attorney General to become improperly politicized. Following calls for his removal, Gonzales resigned from the office &quot;in the best interests of the department&quot;, on August 27, 2007, effective September 17, 2007.

In 2008, Gonzales began a mediation and consulting practice. Additionally, he taught a political science course and served as a diversity recruiter at Texas Tech University. As of 2024, Gonzales is the dean of Belmont University College of Law in Nashville, Tennessee, where he teaches National Security Law. He was formerly Of Counsel at a Nashville-based law firm, Waller Lansden Dortch &amp; Davis, LLP, where he advised clients on special matters, government investigations and regulatory matters.

==Early life and education==
Gonzales was born in San Antonio, Texas, to a Catholic family, and raised in Humble, Texas, a town outside of Houston. Of Mexican descent, he was the second of eight children born to Maria (Rodriguez) and Pablo M. Gonzales. His father, who died in 1982, was a migrant worker and then a construction worker with a second grade education. His mother worked at home raising eight children and had a sixth grade education. Gonzales and his family of ten lived in a small, two-bedroom home built by his father and uncles with no telephone and no hot running water. According to Gonzales, he is unaware whether immigration documentation exists for three of his grandparents who were born in Mexico and may have entered and resided in the United States illegally.

An honors student at MacArthur High School in unincorporated Harris County, Gonzales enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1973, for a four-year term of enlistment. He served one year at a remote radar site with 100 other GIs at Fort Yukon, Alaska. He was then released from active duty to attend the USAFA Prep School after which he received an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. Prior to beginning his third year at the academy, which would have caused him to incur a further service obligation, he left the academy and was released from the enlistment contract. He transferred to Rice University in Houston, where he was a resident of Lovett College. He went on to be selected as the Charles Parkhill Scholar of Political Science and was awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honors in political science in 1979. He then earned a Juris Doctor (J.D:) degree from Harvard Law School in 1982.

== Private life ==

Gonzales has been married twice: he and his first wife, Diane Clemens, divorced in 1985; he and his second wife, Rebecca Turner Gonzales, have three sons.

==Early career==
Gonzales was an attorney in private practice from 1982 until 1994 with the Houston law firm Vinson and Elkins, where he became a partner—one of the first Hispanic partners in its history—and where he worked primarily with corporate clients. In 1994, he was named general counsel to then–Texas Governor George W. Bush, rising to become Secretary of State of Texas in 1997 and named to the Texas Supreme Court in 1999, both appointments made by Governor Bush. Gonzales won his election bid to remain on the court in the Republican primary in 2000, and was elected to a full six-year term on the State Supreme Court in the November 2000 general election.

==Recognition==
Gonzales has been active in the community, serving as board director or committee member for several non-profit organizations between 1985 and 1994.

In the legal sphere Gonzales provided pro bono legal services to the Host Committee for the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, acted as a board director for the State Bar of Texas from 1991 to 1994, and was board trustee of the Texas Bar Foundation from 1996 to 1999. He has received numerous professional awards, including the Presidential Citation from the State Bar of Texas in 1997 in claimed recognition of his dedication to addressing basic legal needs of the indigent. In 1999, he was named Latino Lawyer of the Year by the Hispanic National Bar Association.

Between 2002 and 2003, Gonzales was recognized as a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University and received the Harvard Law School Association Award, John Ben Shepperd Public Leadership Institute Outstanding Texas Leader Award, United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce President&#x27;s Award, League of United Latin American Citizens President&#x27;s Award, the Gary L. McPherson Distinguished Alumni Award from the American Council of Young Political Leaders, the Chairman&#x27;s Leadership Award from the Texas Association of Mexican American Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund&#x27;s Truinfador Award, the Hispanic Hero Award from the Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans, the Good Neighbor Award from the United States–Mexican Chamber of Commerce, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Travis County, Texas Republican Party. In 2004, Gonzales was given the Exemplary Leader Award by the Houston American Leadership Forum. In 2005 he was given the Hector Barreto, Sr. Award by the Latino Coalition and a President&#x27;s Award by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

As the son of former migrant workers, many believed Gonzales&#x27;s appointment as Attorney General of the United States to be an example of the American dream. He was named Hispanic American of the Year by &quot;Hispanic&quot; magazine in 2005 and one of the 25 Most Influential Hispanics in America by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Gonzales was inducted into the Class of 2005 in the American Academy of Achievement. Gonzales received the Distinguished Leadership Award in 2006 from Leadership Houston. In 2007, as he left government service, he was given the Director&#x27;s Award from the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Public Service.

On May 20, 2006, Houston Mayor Bill White proclaimed &quot;Alberto R. Gonzales Day&quot; in Houston in recognition of what was believed to be his contributions to the betterment of the City of Houston. Academic institutions have also recognized Gonzales&#x27;s achievements. He received an Honorary Doctor of Laws in 2002 from The Catholic University of America; an Honorary Degree in Arts and Letters in 2003 from Miami-Dade Community College; an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws in 2005 from the University of the District of Columbia; an Honorary Degree in Associate of Arts in 2005 from the Houston Community College System; and an Honorary Alumnus Award in 2007 from Southern Methodist University.

==Counsel to Governor Bush==
As counsel to Governor Bush, Gonzales helped advise Bush in connection with jury duty when he was called in a 1996 Travis County drunk driving case. The case led to controversy during Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign because Bush&#x27;s answers to the potential juror questionnaire did not disclose Bush&#x27;s own 1976 misdemeanor drunk driving conviction. Gonzales made no formal request for Bush to be excused from jury duty but raised a possible conflict of interest because as the Governor, Bush might be called upon to pardon the accused party. Gonzales&#x27;s work in this case has been described as &quot;canny lawyering&quot;.

As Governor Bush&#x27;s counsel in Texas, Gonzales also reviewed all clemency requests. A 2003 article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, and failed to second-guess convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales&#x27;s deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales from what he characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process under Bush. Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency even if he had wanted to do so in a case. The fact remains that only one death sentence was overturned by Governor Bush, and the state of Texas executed more prisoners during Gonzales&#x27;s term than any other state.

==White House Counsel==
As White House counsel, and later as attorney general, Gonzales served president George W. Bush through a period of escalating controversy over the legality of U.S. policies in the fight against terrorism. Gonzales approved the legal framework for the administration&#x27;s anti-terrorism efforts and was a reliable advocate for White House policy. He supported positions that enlarged the power of the executive and diminished protections for interrogation subjects. These rulings were vocally challenged by many scholars and human-rights advocates and were partly overturned by the courts. He resigned following sharp criticism of his handling of the firing of nine U.S. attorneys and subsequent testimony during congressional hearings.

===Support for use of torture===

Gonzalez was a supporter of the Bush administration&#x27;s policy of torture of detainees, internally referred to as &quot;Enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;.

In January 2002, Gonzales authored a memo that explored whether the Geneva Convention section III on the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW) applied to Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters captured in Afghanistan and held in detention facilities around the world, including Camp X-Ray in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The memo made several arguments both for and against providing GPW protection to al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. The memo concluded that certain provisions of GPW were outdated and ill-suited for dealing with captured Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters: &quot;[The war against terrorism] is not the traditional clash between nations adhering to the laws of war that formed the backdrop for GPW. The nature of the new war places a high premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly obtain information from captured terrorists and their sponsors in order to avoid further atrocities against American civilians, and the need to try terrorists for war crimes such as wantonly killing civilians.&quot;

Gonzales later explained, &quot;The old ways may not work here. That&#x27;s what the memo was intended to convey to the President. I never meant to convey to the President that the basic values in the Geneva Convention were outdated.&quot; He noted that a British parliamentary committee visiting Guantánamo, while horrified by conditions at the base, had reached a similar conclusion when it said, &quot;the Geneva Conventions are failing to provide necessary protection because they lack clarity and are out of date&quot;. He argued that existing military regulations and instructions from the President were more than adequate to ensure that the principles of the Geneva Convention would be applied. He also expressed a concern that undefined language in Common Article III of GPW, such as &quot;outrages upon personal dignity&quot; and &quot;inhuman treatment&quot; could make officials and military leaders subject to the War Crimes Act of 1996 if actions were deemed to constitute violations of the Act. Attorney General John Ashcroft made a similar argument on behalf of the Justice Department by letter to the President dated February 1, 2002, writing that a presidential determination &quot;against treaty application would provide the highest assurance that no court would subsequently entertain charges that American military officers, intelligence officials or law enforcement officials violated Geneva Convention rules relating to field conduct, detention conduct or interrogation of detainees. The War Crimes Act of 1996 makes violations of parts of the Geneva Convention a crime in the United States.&quot;

Gonzalez oversaw President Bush&#x27;s Office of Legal Counsel on August 1, 2002, at which time the OLC produced the Bybee memo, a document that provided the legal framework by which previous interpretations of the Geneva Convention and the United Nations Convention Against Torture were modified to expand Presidential authority to enable so-called &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;.

The memo was produced in response to a specific CIA request for clarification of the standards of interrogation under U.S. law, in the specific case of Abu Zabaydah, a man believed at the time to be a high-level al-Qaeda leader. In response, the Justice Department issued a classified August 1, 2002, memo to the CIA from Jay Bybee, the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, and an August 1, 2002, legal opinion to Gonzales from Jay Bybee defining torture as an act specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.

Journalists including Jane Mayer, Joby Warrick and Peter Finn, and Alex Koppelman have reported the CIA was already using these harsh tactics before the memo authorizing their use was written, and that it was used to provide after-the-fact legal support for harsh interrogation techniques. A Department of Justice 2009 report regarding prisoner abuses reportedly stated the memos were prepared one month after Abu Zubaydah had already been subjected to the specific techniques authorized in the August 1, 2002, memo. John Kiriakou stated in July 2009 that Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded in the early summer of 2002, months before the August 1, 2002, memo was written.

The memo described ten techniques that the interrogators wanted to use: &quot;(1) attention grasp, (2) walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard.&quot; Many of the techniques were, until then, generally considered illegal. Many other techniques developed by the CIA were held to constitute inhumane and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. As reported later, many of these interrogation techniques were previously considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time of Abu Zubaydah&#x27;s capture. For instance, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding. Since 1930, the United States had defined sleep deprivation as an illegal form of torture. Many other techniques developed by the CIA constitute inhuman and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture, and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

In May 2005, three months after Gonzales became attorney general, Steven G. Bradbury of the Office of Legal Counsel issued a pair of classified opinions that, for the first time, provided Central Intelligence Agency explicit authorization to apply to terror suspects a variety of painful physical and psychological interrogation methods, either alone or in combination. The approved techniques included striking a prisoner, exposure to extreme temperatures, stress positions, walling, sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours ( days), and the simulated drowning procedure known as &quot;waterboarding&quot;. These secret memos superseded a previous, unclassified legal opinion that declared torture &quot;abhorrent.&quot; Nevertheless, the classified opinions claimed that their reasoning and conclusions were based upon and fully consistent with the previous legal opinion. Gonzales reportedly approved the May 10, 2005, classified legal memoranda over the policy objections of James B. Comey, the outgoing deputy attorney general, who told colleagues at the Justice Department that they would all be &quot;ashamed&quot; when the world eventually learned of it. Patrick Leahy and John Conyers, chairmen of the respective Senate and House Judiciary Committees, requested that the Justice Department turn over documents related to the classified 2005 legal opinions to their committees for review.

In 2009, The Obama administration stated it would abide by the Geneva Convention and described some of the enhanced interrogation techniques established under Attorney General Gonzales&#x27;s tenure as torture. On January 22, 2009, President Obama signed an executive order requiring the CIA to use only the 19 interrogation methods outlined in the United States Army Field Manual on interrogations &quot;unless the Attorney General with appropriate consultation provides further guidance.&quot; Bradbury&#x27;s memoranda were publicly released by the Obama Administration on April 16, 2009.

===Objectivity===
Gonzales had a long relationship with former president George W. Bush. Gonzales served as a general counsel when Bush was the governor of Texas. Such relationship made critics question whether he would maintain independence in his administration of the U.S. Department of Justice. Gonzales has been called Bush&#x27;s &quot;.&quot; Even though the advice given by Gonzales was based and supported by other lawyers, specifically the Department of Justice, charged by statute to provide legal advice to the President, critics claim that Gonzales gave only the legal advice Bush wanted. Critics questioned Gonzales&#x27;s ethics and professional conduct.

&quot;To his backers, Gonzales is a quiet, hardworking attorney general notable for his open management style and his commitment to the administration of justice and to the war on terrorism.&quot;

One publication reported, &quot;Gonzales contends that his friendship with Bush makes him a better advocate for the rule of law within the executive branch.&quot; My responsibilities is to ensure that the laws are enforced, that everyone in the country receives justice under the law—independent of my relationship with the White House, independent of my relationship with the President of the United States,&quot; he told National Journal. Another report states that Gonzales has &quot;a long history of dogged obedience to the President, which often has come at the cost of institutional independence and adherence to the rule of law.&quot;

===Executive Order 13233===
Executive Order 13233, drafted by Gonzales and issued by President George W. Bush on November 1, 2001, shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, attempted to place limitations on the Freedom of Information Act by restricting access to the records of former presidents. The order asserted the President&#x27;s power to delay the release of presidential records longer than the congressionally mandated period of 12 years after the president leaves office. Executive Order 13233 revoked President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Executive Order 12667 on the same subject and had the effect of delaying the release of Reagan&#x27;s papers, which were due to be made public when Bush took office in 2001. While the policy was being drawn up, Gonzales as Counsel to the President issued a series of orders to the U.S. Archivist to delay the release of Reagan&#x27;s records. This order was the subject of a number of lawsuits and Congressional attempts to overturn it. In 2007, a D.C. district court ordered the Archivist not to obey this order, finding it to be &quot;arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.&quot; On January 21, 2009 (his first day in office), President Barack Obama revoked Executive Order 13233 by issuing , with wording largely matching Reagan&#x27;s Executive Order 12667.

===Energy Task Force secrecy===
Gonzales fought with Congress to keep Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s Energy Task Force documents from being reviewed. His arguments were ultimately upheld by courts. On July 2, 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Vice President, but remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit. On May 11, 2005, the D.C. Circuit threw out the lawsuit and ruled the Vice President was free to meet in private with energy industry representatives in 2001 while drawing up the President&#x27;s energy policy.

==Attorney general==

Gonzales&#x27;s name was sometimes floated as a possible nominee to the United States Supreme Court during Bush&#x27;s first presidential term. On November 10, 2004, it was announced that he would be nominated to replace United States Attorney General John Ashcroft for Bush&#x27;s second term. Gonzales was regarded as a moderate compared to Ashcroft because he was not seen as opposing abortion or affirmative action. Although he has never stated publicly his support for abortion and later as attorney general, was the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;, which reinforced the ban on late-term abortion that was previously overturned, and had stated publicly his opposition to racial quotas, some people assumed Gonzales did not oppose abortion or affirmative action. According to a Texas Monthly article, Gonzales has never said he was pro-choice and he has publicly opposed racial quotas.

The perceived departure from some conservative viewpoints elicited strong opposition to Gonzales that started during his Senate confirmation proceedings at the beginning of President Bush&#x27;s second term. &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted anonymous Republican officials as saying that Gonzales&#x27;s appointment to attorney general was a way to &quot;bolster Mr. Gonzales&#x27;s credentials&quot; en route to a later Supreme Court appointment.

Gonzales enjoyed broad bipartisan support in connection with his nomination, including the support of former Democratic HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros and Colorado Democratic Senator Ken Salazar. One writer noted, &quot;A senator from Pennsylvania said, &#x27;I have always found him [Alberto Gonzales] to be completely forthright, brutally honest—in some cases telling me things I did not want to hear but always forthright, always honest, sincere, serious. This is a serious man who takes the responsibilities that have been given to him as a great privilege and a great honor which he holds very carefully and gently in his hands.&#x27; Said another senator, this one from Kentucky, &#x27;Judge Gonzales is proof that in America, there are no artificial barriers to success. A man or woman can climb to any height that his or her talents can take them. For Judge Gonzales, that is a very high altitude indeed. And luckily for his country, he is not quite finished climbing yet.
The nomination was approved on February 3, 2005, with the confirming vote largely split along party lines 60–36 (54 Republicans and six Democrats in favor, and 36 Democrats against, along with four abstentions: three Democrats and one Republicans).
He was sworn in on February 3, 2005.

=== Right to writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. Constitution ===
Gonzales helped draft the January 2002 Presidential Order that authorized the use of military tribunals to try terrorist suspects. The order provided the President the power to hold any non-citizen who he deemed a terrorist, or accessory to a terrorist, in military detention and subject to trial before a military commission. Subsequently the United States Department of Defense (DOD) organized military tribunals to judge charges against enemy combatant detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In the early years, the camp authorities did not allow foreign detainees access to attorneys, or materials supporting their charges, and the executive branch declared them outside the reach of due process under &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. In &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; (2004), the US Supreme Court ruled that they did have rights to habeas corpus and had to be provided access to legal counsel and an opportunity to challenge their detention before an impartial tribunal. Further, in 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; that trying Guantanamo Bay detainees under the existing Guantanamo military commission (known also as Military Tribunal) was illegal under US law, including the Geneva Conventions.

The president requested and Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. The bill was controversial for continuing to authorize the President to designate certain people as &quot;unlawful enemy combatants,&quot; thus making them subject to military commissions, and depriving them of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. In &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; (2008), the US Supreme Court ruled that foreign detainees held by the United States, including those at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, did have the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; under the US constitution, as the US had sole authority at the Guantanamo Bay base. It held that the 2006 Military Commissions Act was an unconstitutional suspension of that right.

On January 18, 2007, Gonzales was invited to speak to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he shocked the committee&#x27;s ranking member, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, with statements regarding the right of habeas corpus in the United States Constitution. An excerpt of the exchange follows:

Senator Specter was referring to 2nd Clause of Section 9 of Article One of the Constitution of the United States, which reads: &quot;The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.&quot; This passage has been historically interpreted to mean that the right of habeas corpus is inherently established. Gonzales dissents from the consensus view, siding with Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who said &quot;[a]though the Constitution prohibits Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus except during times of rebellion or invasion, this provision was probably meant to keep Congress from suspending the writ and preventing state courts from releasing individuals who were wrongfully imprisoned. The constitutional provision does not create a right to habeas corpus; rather federal statutes [do so].&quot; Additionally, &quot;the Constitutional Convention prevented Congress from obstructing the states courts&#x27; ability to grant the writ, but did not try to create a federal constitutional right to habeas corpus&quot;. &quot;After all, if the suspension clause itself were an affirmative grant of procedural rights to those held in federal custody, there would have been little need for the first Congress to enact as it did, habeas corpus protections in the Judiciary Act of 1789.&quot; Chemerinsky&#x27;s argument has been denied by Justice Paul Stevens in a 2001 opinion in an immigration case involving the issue, where Stevens touches upon what he believes the &#x27;far more sensible view&#x27;:

Justice Stevens&#x27; assertion is backed up by sentiments found in the Federalist No. 84, which enshrines the right to petition for habeas corpus as fundamental:

The Constitution presupposes that courts in the United States will have the authority to issue the writ as they historically did at common law. See, e.g., Immigration and Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 666 (1996). The Suspension clause of the Constitution provides that &quot;[t]he privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.&quot; As some commentators have noted, &quot;the text does not explicitly confer a right to habeas relief, but merely sets forth when the Privilege of the Writ may be suspended&quot;.
As Robert Parry writes in the Baltimore Chronicle &amp; Sentinel:

===Dismissal of U.S. attorneys===
By law, U.S. Attorneys are appointed for a term of four years, and each U.S. Attorney serves at the pleasure of the President and is subject to removal by the President for any reason, or no reason at all, barring only illegal and improper reasons. When Gonzales became attorney general in 2005, he ordered a performance review of all U.S. Attorneys. On December 7, 2006, seven United States attorneys were notified by the United States Department of Justice that they were being dismissed, after the George W. Bush administration sought their resignation. One more, Bud Cummins, who had been informed of his dismissal in June 2006, announced his resignation on December 15, 2006, effective December 20, 2006, upon being notified of Tim Griffin&#x27;s appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. In the subsequent congressional hearings and press reports, it was disclosed that additional U.S. attorneys were controversially dismissed without explanation to the dismissee in 2005 and 2006, and that at least 26 U.S. attorneys were at various times considered for dismissal.

Although U.S. attorneys can be dismissed at the discretion of the president, critics claimed that the dismissals were either motivated by desire to install attorneys more loyal to the Republican party (&quot;loyal Bushies,&quot; in the words of Kyle Sampson, Gonzales&#x27;s former chief of staff) or as retribution for actions or inactions damaging to the Republican party. At least six of the eight had received positive performance reviews at the Department of Justice. DOJ officials Will Moschella and Monica Goodling both testified under oath that EARS evaluations are office-wide reviews, they are not reviews of the U.S. Attorneys themselves. Gonzales testified under oath that EARS evaluations do not necessarily reflect on the U.S. Attorney. In other words, these reviews were not evaluations of the performance of the fired federal prosecutors.

In a press conference given on March 13, Gonzales suggested that &quot;incomplete information, was communicated or may have been communicated to the Congress&quot; and he accepted full responsibility. Nonetheless, Gonzales avowed that his knowledge of the process to fire and select new US attorneys was limited to how the US attorneys may have been classified as &quot;strong performers, not-as-strong performers, and weak performers.&quot; Gonzales also asserted that was all he knew of the process, saying that &quot;[I] was not involved in seeing any memos, was not involved in any discussions about what was going on. That&#x27;s basically what I knew as the Attorney General.&quot;

Department of Justice records released on March 23, however, appeared to contradict some of the Attorney General&#x27;s assertions, indicating that on his Nov 27 schedule &quot;he attended an hour-long meeting at which, aides said, he approved a detailed plan for executing the purge.&quot; Despite insisting that he was not involved in the &quot;deliberations&quot; leading up to the firing of the attorneys, newly released emails also suggest that he had indeed been notified and that he had given ultimate approval.

In his prepared testimony to Congress on April 19, 2007, Gonzales insisted he left the decisions on the firings to his staff. ABC News, however, obtained an internal department email showing that Gonzales urged the ouster of Carol Lam, one of the fired attorneys, six months before she was asked to leave. During actual testimony on April 19, Gonzales stated at least 71 times that he couldn&#x27;t recall events related to the controversy. Those dubious explanations led to diminished Senate support for his continued tenure, with even conservative Republicans Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma calling for his resignation.

His responses frustrated the Democrats on the committee, as well as several Republicans. One example of such frustration came in an exchange between Sessions and Gonzales regarding a November 2006 meeting. Sessions was one of the most conservative members of the Senate, and was one of the Bush Administration&#x27;s staunchest allies. At the meeting, the attorney firings were purportedly discussed, but Gonzales did not remember such discussion. As reported by the Washington Post, the dialogue went as follows:

Another example came when Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who had been the first lawmaker to call for Gonzales&#x27;s ouster, declined to ask his last round of questions. Instead, a visibly angry Schumer said there was no point to further questioning and reiterated his call for Gonzales to resign. By Schumer&#x27;s count, Gonzales had stated &quot;over a hundred times&quot; that he didn&#x27;t know or couldn&#x27;t recall important details concerning the firings, and also didn&#x27;t seem to know about the workings of his own department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give &quot;a full, complete and convincing explanation&quot; for why the eight attorneys were fired.

Both Democrats and Republicans were critical of Gonzales&#x27;s testimony to congress, which was widely regarded as exhibiting greater loyalty to president Bush than to the truth. With increasing numbers of senators calling for him to go, Gonzales resigned as attorney general effective September 17, 2007.

The Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility commenced an investigation into the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys and issued a report in September 2008. The report cited serious issues of accountability removing a few of the U.S. Attorneys, but there was no finding that the nine U.S. Attorneys were removed for illegal or improper reasons. To the contrary, the report concluded that Margaret Chiara and Kevin Ryan were removed appropriately for management issues. Paul Charlton was removed for his action relating to a death penalty case and unilateral implementation of an interrogation policy. The report found Carol Lam was removed because of the Justice Department&#x27;s concerns about the low number of gun and immigration prosecutions in her district. The report concluded John McKay was asked to leave because of his disagreement with the Deputy Attorney General over an information-sharing program. The report could not cite to a reason Dan Bogden was asked to leave, but there was no finding that anything illegal or improper occurred with his removal. The report concluded Bud Cummins was asked to leave to make room for another political appointee that he himself conceded under oath was qualified to serve as a U.S. Attorney. These findings were consistent with testimony given by Gonzales. Politics was clearly involved.

The report also concluded Todd Graves was removed to settle a political dispute in Missouri, which was motivated by politics. The report found that it could not conclude that David Iglesias was removed for an improper reason. Because the IG had no authority to investigate Congress or the White House, the IG asked Attorney General Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Iglesias removal. This special prosecutor found no wrongdoing in the removal of Iglesias. The DOJ IG found no criminal wrongdoing in the records. As the Wall Street Journal reported &quot;the Justice Department informed Congress on Wednesday that a special investigator in the case found no evidence of wrongdoing ... the investigator&#x27;s final word is that no Administration official gave &#x27;false statements&#x27; to Congress or to the DOJ Inspector General, which carried out their own investigation.&quot; In particular, the report found no evidence that Gonzales made false or misleading statements to Congress, thus clearing him of accusations of perjury.

The IG report determined that some statements made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007, press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. The report did not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted to set the record straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007, press conference were misstatements and were overboard. Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: &quot;I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I &quot;was not involved in any discussions about what was going on.&quot; That statement was too broad. At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, &quot;I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that&#x27;s what I knew&quot;. Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. Thus, my statement about &quot;discussions&quot; was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people.&quot;

In August 2009, White House documents released showed that Rove raised concerns directly with Gonzales and that Domenici or an intermediary may have contacted the Justice Department as early as 2005 to complain. In contrast, Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007: &quot;I don&#x27;t recall ... Senator Domenici ever requesting that Mr. Iglesias be removed.&quot; In July 2010, Department of Justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firings were not criminal, saying &quot;Evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias. The investigative team also determined that the evidence did not warrant expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the removal of Iglesias.&quot;

=== NSA domestic eavesdropping program ===

Gonzales was an early advocate of the controversial USA PATRIOT Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on October 26, 2001. During Gonzales&#x27;s tenure, the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were accused of improperly, and perhaps illegally, using the USA PATRIOT Act to uncover personal information about U.S. citizens.

In a December 2005 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) was eavesdropping on U.S. citizens without warrants in cases where (i) NSA intelligence agents had reason to believe at least one party to the call was a member of al Qaeda or a group affiliated with al Qaeda, and (ii) the call was international. &quot;The New York Times&quot; acknowledged that the activities had been classified, and that it had disclosed the activities over the Administration&#x27;s objections. As such, Attorney General Gonzales threatened the &quot;Times&quot; with prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917, since knowing publication of classified information is a federal crime. Gonzales raised the possibility that &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalists could be prosecuted for publishing classified information based on the outcome of the criminal investigation underway into leaks to the &quot;Times&quot; of data about the National Security Agency&#x27;s surveillance of terrorist-related calls between the United States and abroad. He said, &quot;I understand very much the role that the press plays in our society, the protection under the First Amendment we want to protect and respect ...&quot; As for the &quot;Times&quot;, he said, &quot;As we do in every case, it&#x27;s a case-by-case evaluation about what the evidence shows us, our interpretation of the law. We have an obligation to enforce the law and to prosecute those who engage in criminal activity.&quot;

The publication led to an investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) over the role of Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers in giving legal advice to support various intelligence collection activities. OPR is responsible for investigating allegations of professional misconduct by DOJ attorneys. The objective of OPR is to ensure that DOJ attorneys perform their duties in accordance with the highest professional standards.

The Bush Administration and Attorney General Gonzales believed that OPR did not have the authority to investigate Gonzales&#x27;s role as White House Counsel in connection with certain intelligence activities authorized by the President. In response to suggestions that Gonzales blocked the investigation or that the President blocked the investigation to protect Gonzales, Assistant Attorney General Richard Hertling informed Chairman John Conyers on March 22, 2007, that &quot;the President made the decision not to grant the requested security clearances to&quot; OPR staff. Judge Gonzales &quot;was not told he was the subject or target of the OPR investigation, nor did he believe himself to be ...&quot; Judge Gonzales &quot;did not ask the President to shut down or otherwise impede the OPR investigation&quot;. Judge Gonzales &quot;recommended to the President that OPR be granted security clearance.&quot;

In a letter to the Senate dated August 1, 2007, Gonzales disclosed that shortly after the September 11 attacks, the President authorized the NSA, under a single Presidential Authorization, to engage in a number of intelligence activities, which would later be collectively described as the &quot;President&#x27;s Surveillance Program&quot; (PSP) by the DOJ Inspector General, Glenn A. Fine. Some of these authorized activities were described as the &quot;Terrorist Surveillance Program&quot; (TSP) by President Bush, in an address to the nation on December 16, 2005. As the August 1 letter indicates, the dispute between the President and James Comey that led to the hospital visit was not over TSP, it concerned other classified intelligence activities that are part of PSP and have not been disclosed. He defended his authorization of the program, asserting &quot;if you are talking with al-Qaeda, we want to know why.&quot; In his letter, Gonzales wrote the Senate Judiciary Committee that he defined TSP as the program the President publicly confirmed, a program that targets communications where one party is outside the United States, and as to which the government had reason to believe at least one party to the communication is a member of al-Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist organization. Indeed, prior to the 2007 letter, Gonzales provided the same definition of TSP in several public appearances leading up to a hearing in Congress on February 6, 2006.

In March 2004, the TSP operations, (code-named Stellar Wind,) became the focal point for a dispute between the White House and then-acting-Attorney-General James B. Comey, resulting in a dramatic, late-night meeting between Gonzales, Comey, the bedridden AG John Ashcroft, and other DOJ officials, in a George Washington University Hospital room. According to initial statements by Gonzales, the disagreement was not over TSP; rather, he claimed it concerned other classified intelligence activities that fell under the PSP, which had not been disclosed. Comey contended that the incident, (which had culminated in a heated phone conversation following the hospital visit,) had indeed been over the activities comprising the TSP. Through a spokesperson, Gonzales later denied his original assertion that the dispute was over TSP, claiming that he had misspoken. The controversy over these conflicting statements led Senator Charles Schumer to request appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate if Gonzales had committed perjury.

In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 15, 2007, former Deputy Attorney General Comey was asked to recall the events of the evening of March 10, 2004, when, (at the behest of President Bush,) Gonzales and Bush&#x27;s then-chief-of-staff Andrew H. Card Jr. sought to bypass Comey&#x27;s refusal to authorize &quot;a particular classified program,&quot; by appealing to the ailing John Ashcroft in a visit to his hospital bedside, as he recovered from surgery for pancreatitis. According to Comey, he had consulted with AG Ashcroft prior to his hospitalization and, (though Ashcroft had previously signed off on the program many times in previous years,) the two of them came to agree that there had arisen legitimate concerns, which interfered with the ability of the attorney general&#x27;s office, &quot;to certify (the program&#x27;s) legality, which was our obligation for the program to be renewed.&quot; More than a week later, Comey continued, Ashcroft had become extremely ill and his wife had forbidden any visitors to his hospital room, so when he and the other officials met at his bedside on March 10, he was very concerned about General Ashcroft&#x27;s ability to think clearly about the issue at hand.

Later testimony from Gonzales and others confirmed that Ashcroft did not seem disoriented, but in fact seemed lucid enough to describe to Card and Gonzales, in great detail, the basis of the Department&#x27;s legal arguments, and even to complain about clearance decisions by the President relative to the TSP.

Comey also testified that there was significant dissent among top law enforcement officers over the program, although he did not specifically identify it in the hearing. Moreover, in light of the incident at the hospital, &quot;top Justice Department officials were prepared to resign over it.&quot;

Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department, corroborates many of the details of Comey&#x27;s Senate testimony regarding the March 10, 2004, hospital room visit, in a preview of his book &quot;The Terror Presidency&quot;, which was to be published in Fall 2007. In the September 9, 2007, issue of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; Jeffrey Rosen reports on an extended interview he had with Goldsmith, who was also in the hospital room that night.

Comey also testified that Ashcroft &quot;expressed himself in very strong terms.&quot; Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke at length about the legal issue. &quot;Attorney General Ashcroft ... [gave] a couple of minutes&#x27; speech in which he said that he ... shared the Justice department&#x27;s concerns.&quot; Although he was not present for the conversation between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, &quot;Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed.&quot; On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft&#x27;s competency. &quot;Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft&#x27;s condition. And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn&#x27;t fully competent to make the decision.&quot; In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, &quot;Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I&#x27;ve heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.
During the July 24 hearing, Gonzales&#x27;s testimony lasted for almost four hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He appeared to contradict the earlier statements made by James Comey regarding the hospital room meeting with John Ashcroft.

Senator Chuck Schumer confronted Gonzales over this statement: &quot;That is not what Mr. Comey says; that is not what the people in the room say.&quot; Gonzales responded &quot;That&#x27;s how we clarify it.&quot; Nonetheless, the DOJ Inspector General&#x27;s report concluded that there was nothing false or intentionally misleading in Gonzales&#x27;s account.

The Inspector General also concluded that the dispute between the White House and the DOJ concerned &quot;Other Intelligence Activities,&quot; which, though they had been implemented through the same Presidential Authorization, were not the same as the communications interception activities that the President publicly identified as the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The DOJ Inspector General agreed with Gonzales noting in his report that the &quot;dispute-which resulted in the visit to Attorney General Ashcroft&#x27;s hospital room by Gonzales and Card and brought several senior DOJ and FBI officials to the brink of resignations – concerned certain of the Other Intelligence Activities that were different from the communication interception activities that the President later publicly acknowledged as the Terrorist Surveillance Program, but that had been implemented through the same Presidential Authorization. As the IG report confirms, the dispute involved Other Intelligence Activities, it was not about TSP.

Through his testimony before Congress on issues ranging from the Patriot Act to U.S. Attorney firings, he commonly admitted ignorance. The response to Gonzales&#x27;s testimony by those Senators serving on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees was one of disbelief. Russ Feingold, who is a member of both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, said, &quot;I believe your testimony is misleading at best,&quot; which Sheldon Whitehouse—also a member of both committees—concurred with, saying, &quot;I have exactly the same perception.&quot; Chuck Schumer said Gonzales was &quot;not being straightforward&quot; with the committee. Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, &quot;I just don&#x27;t trust you,&quot; and urged Gonzales to carefully review his testimony. The ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, said to Gonzales, &quot;Your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable.&quot; Leahy and Specter&#x27;s comments were interpreted as warnings that Gonzales might have been perjuring himself. After the meeting, Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller said Gonzales was being &quot;untruthful.&quot; Rockefeller&#x27;s sentiments were echoed by Jane Harman, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, who accused Gonzales of &quot;selectively declassifying information to defend his own conduct.&quot;

On July 26, 2007, the Associated Press obtained a four-page memorandum from the office of former Director of National Intelligence John D. Negroponte dated May 17, 2006, which appeared to contradict Gonzales&#x27;s testimony the previous day regarding the subject of a March 10, 2004, emergency Congressional briefing that preceded his hospital room meeting with former attorney general John Ashcroft, James B. Comey and former White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. There was no contradiction, however, as the July 1, 2009, IG report confirms. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the President authorized a number of intelligence activities reported by the IG on the President&#x27;s Surveillance Program (PSP). One set of activities were TSP, but the dispute was about certain of the Other Intelligence Activities. The IG report is clear on p. 37 that the TSP &quot;was not the subject of the hospital room confrontation or the threatened resignations.&quot; P. 36 of the Inspector General report goes on to say that the White House had a major disagreement related to PSP. The dispute that resulted in the visit to Attorney General Ashcroft&#x27;s hospital room by Gonzales and Card and brought several senior DOJ and FBI officials to the brink of resignation-concerned certain of the Other Intelligence Activities that were different from the communications interception activities that the President later publicly acknowledged as the TSP, but that had been implemented through the same President Authorizations.

On that same day, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Robert S. Mueller III also seemed to dispute the accuracy of Gonzales&#x27;s Senate Judiciary Committee testimony of the previous day regarding the events of March 10, 2004, in his own sworn testimony on that subject before the House Judiciary Committee.

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) asked Mueller &quot;Did you have an opportunity to talk to General Ashcroft, or did he discuss what was discussed in the meeting with Attorney General Gonzales and the chief of staff?&quot; He replied &quot;I did have a brief discussion with Attorney General Ashcroft.&quot; Lee went on to ask &quot;I guess we use [the phrase] TSP [Terrorist Surveillance Program], we use warrantless wiretapping. So would I be comfortable in saying that those were the items that were part of the discussion?&quot; He responded &quot;It was—the discussion was on a national—an NSA program that has been much discussed, yes.&quot;

On Thursday, August 16, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee released the heavily redacted notes of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III regarding the Justice Department and White House deliberations of March 2004, which included the March 10, 2004, hospital-room visit of Gonzales and Andrew H. Card Jr. on John Ashcroft in the presence of then-acting Attorney General James B. Comey. The notes list 26 meetings and phone conversations over three weeks—from March 1 to 23—during a debate that reportedly almost led to mass resignations at the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

On July 26, 2007, a letter to Solicitor General Paul Clement, Senators Charles Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Russ Feingold and Sheldon Whitehouse urged that an independent counsel be appointed to investigate whether Gonzales had perjured himself in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the previous day. &quot;We ask that you immediately appoint an independent special counsel from outside the Department of Justice to determine whether Attorney General Gonzales may have misled Congress or perjured himself in testimony before Congress,&quot; the letter read in part. According to the July 10, 2009, DOJ Inspector General Unclassified Report on the President&#x27;s Surveillance Program, Gonzales did not intend to mislead Congress. There was no finding of perjury or other criminal wrongdoing by Gonzales.

On Wednesday, June 27, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas to the United States Department of Justice, the White House, and Vice President Dick Cheney seeking internal documents regarding the program&#x27;s legality and details of the NSA&#x27;s cooperative agreements with private telecommunications corporations. In addition to the subpoenas, committee chairman Patrick Leahy sent Gonzales a letter about possible false statements made under oath by U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings before the committee the previous year.
In an August 17, 2007, reply letter to Leahy asking for an extension of the August 20 deadline
 for compliance, White House counsel Fred Fielding argued that the subpoenas called for the production of &quot;extraordinarily sensitive national security information,&quot; and he said much of the information—if not all—could be subject to a claim of executive privilege.
 On August 20, 2007, Fielding wrote to Leahy that the White House needed yet more time to respond to the subpoenas, which prompted Leahy to reply that the Senate might consider a contempt of Congress citation when it returned from its August recess.

On July 27, 2007, both White House Press Secretary Tony Snow and White House spokeswoman Dana Perino defended Gonzales&#x27;s Senate Judiciary Committee testimony regarding the events of March 10, 2004, saying that it did not contradict the sworn House Judiciary Committee account of FBI director Robert S. Mueller III, because Gonzales had been constrained in what he could say because there was a danger he would divulge classified material. Lee Casey, a former Justice Department lawyer during the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, told The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer that it is likely that the apparent discrepancy can be traced to the fact that there are two separate Domestic Surveillance programs. &quot;The program that was leaked in December 2005 is the Comey program. It is not the program that was discussed in the evening when they went to Attorney General Ashcroft&#x27;s hospital room. That program we know almost nothing about. We can speculate about it. ... The program about which he said there was no dispute is a program that was created after the original program died, when Mr. Comey refused to reauthorize it, in March 2004. Mr. Comey then essentially redid the program to suit his legal concerns. And about that program, there was no dispute. There was clearly a dispute about the earlier form or version of the program. The attorney general has not talked about that program. He refers to it as &quot;other intelligence activities&quot; because it is, in fact, still classified.&quot;

On Tuesday, August 28, 2007—one day after Gonzales announced his resignation as Attorney General effective September 17—Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy indicated that it would not affect ongoing investigations by his committee. &quot;I intend to get answers to these questions no matter how long it takes,&quot; Leahy said, suggesting that Gonzales could face subpoenas from the committee for testimony or evidence long after leaving the administration. &quot;You&#x27;ll notice that we&#x27;ve had people subpoenaed even though they&#x27;ve resigned from the White House,&quot; Leahy said, referring to Harriet E. Miers, the former White House counsel, and Karl Rove, who resigned in August 2007 as the president&#x27;s top political aide. &quot;They&#x27;re still under subpoena. They still face contempt if they don&#x27;t appear.&quot; Gonzales testified voluntarily to Congress and provided interviews to the Inspector General on numerous occasions. He ordered full cooperation by all Department of Justice employees with ongoing investigations.

On Thursday, August 30, 2007, Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine disclosed in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that as part of a previously ongoing investigation, his office is looking into whether Gonzales made statements to Congress that were &quot;intentionally false, misleading, or inappropriate,&quot; both about the firing of federal prosecutors and about the terrorist-surveillance program, as committee chairman Patrick Leahy had asked him to do in an August 16, 2007, letter. Fine&#x27;s letter to Leahy said that his office &quot;has ongoing investigations that relate to most of the subjects addressed by the attorney general&#x27;s testimony that you identified.&quot; Fine said that his office is conducting a particular review &quot;relating to the terrorist-surveillance program, as well as a follow-up review of the use of national security letters,&quot; which investigators use to obtain information on e-mail messages, telephone calls and other records from private companies without court approval. Fine concluded his investigation and found that Gonzales did not intend to mislead Congress.

It has been reported that a person involved in the incident of March 10, 2004, hospital room meeting with John Ashcroft has said that much of the confusion and conflicting testimony that occurred about intelligence activities was because certain programs were so classified that they were impossible to speak about clearly. The Department of Justice Inspector General recognized that Gonzales was in the difficult position of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about a highly classified program in an open forum.

On July 31, 2007, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell confirmed, in a letter to Senator Specter, that the activities publicly referred to &quot;as the TSP did not exhaust the activities subject to periodic authorization by the President.&quot; Gonzales was then able to explain publicly, on August 1, 2007, that while TSP &quot;was an extraordinary activity that presented novel and difficult issues and was, as [he understood], the subject of intense deliberations within the Department,&quot; the aspect of Mr. Comey&#x27;s advise [sic] that prompted the Gang of Eight meeting on March 10, 2004, was not about TSP, but was about another or other aspects of the intelligence activities in question, which activities remain classified. Comey himself acknowledged that the nature of the disagreement at issue on March 10, 2004, is &quot;a very complicated matter&quot;, but he declined to discuss in a public setting. Professor Jack Goldsmith appears to acknowledge that there is a difference between TSP and other classified intelligence activities that prompted the March 10, 2004, Gang of Eight meeting and visit to General Ashcroft&#x27;s hospital room.

=== Gonzales v. Carhart ===
As Attorney General, Gonzalez led the Justice Department&#x27;s defense of the 2003 Partial Birth Abortion Act when it was challenged in court and for this reason the legal case bears his name. The Supreme Court issued its opinion in this case on April 18, 2007, ruling in favor of Gonzalez and the Justice Department and upholding the 2003 Partial Birth Abortion Act as constitutional.

==Speculation on Supreme Court nomination==
Shortly before the July 1, 2005, retirement announcement of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, rumors started circulating that a memo had leaked from the White House stating that upon the retirement of either O&#x27;Connor or Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist, that Gonzales would be the first nominee for a vacancy on the Court.

Quickly, conservative stalwarts such as &quot;National Review&quot; magazine and Focus on the Family, among other socially conservative groups, stated they would oppose a Gonzales nomination.

Much of their opposition to Gonzales was based on his perceived support of abortion rights as a result of one vote on a single case before the Texas Supreme Court, In re Jane Doe 5 (43 Tex. Sup. J.910).

In a series of cases before the Texas Supreme Court in 2000, the court was asked to construe for the first time the 1999 Texas parental notification law forbidding a physician from performing an abortion on a pregnant, unaccompanied minor without giving notice to the minor&#x27;s parents at least 48 hours before the procedure. Texas legislators adopted a policy to create a judicial bypass exception in those cases where (1) the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to make the decision to have an abortion performed without notification to either of her parents; (2) notification will not be in the best interest of the minor or (3) notification may lead to physical, sexual or emotional abuse of the minor. The court was asked in these cases to discern legislative intent for the first time to these subjective standards, presumably included in the law as a matter of Texas policy and to make the law constitutional under U.S. Supreme Court precedents.

In the seven parental notification decisions rendered by the court, Gonzales voted to grant one bypass. For &quot;In re Jane Doe 5&quot; his concurring opinion began with the sentence, &quot;I fully join in the Court&#x27;s judgment and opinion.&quot; He went on, though, to address the three dissenting opinions, primarily one by Nathan L. Hecht alleging that the court majority&#x27;s members had disregarded legislative intent in favor of their personal ideologies. Gonzales&#x27;s opinion dealt mostly with how to establish legislative intent. He wrote, &quot;We take the words of the statute as the surest guide to legislative intent. Once we discern the Legislature&#x27;s intent we must put it into effect, even if we ourselves might have made different policy choices.&quot; He added, &quot;[T]o construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism,&quot; and &quot;While the ramifications of such a law and the results of the Court&#x27;s decision here may be personally troubling to me as a parent, it is my obligation as a judge to impartially apply the laws of this state without imposing my moral view on the decisions of the Legislature.&quot;

Political commentators had suggested that Bush forecast the selection of Gonzales with his comments defending the Attorney General made on July 6, 2005, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Bush stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t like it when a friend gets criticized. I&#x27;m loyal to my friends. All of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and a really fine person, is under fire. And so, do I like it? No, I don&#x27;t like it, at all.&quot; This speculation proved to be incorrect, however, as Bush nominated D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge John Roberts to the Supreme Court.

After the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 3, 2005, creating another vacancy, speculation resumed that President George W. Bush might nominate Gonzales to the Court. This again proved to be incorrect, as Bush decided to nominate Roberts to the chief justice position, and on October 3, 2005, nominated Harriet Miers as associate justice, to replace Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. On October 27, 2005, Miers withdrew her nomination, again renewing speculation about a possible Gonzales nomination. This was laid to rest when Judge Samuel Alito received the nomination and subsequent confirmation.

On September 11, 2005, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary chairman Arlen Specter was quoted as saying that it was &quot;a little too soon&quot; after Gonzales&#x27;s appointment as attorney general for him to be appointed to another position, and that such an appointment would require a new series of confirmation hearings. &quot;He [Gonzales] is attacked a lot,&quot; observes Larry Sabato, a political analyst and the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, who adds that the serious political spats &quot;virtually eliminated him from the Supreme Court chase.&quot;

==Resignation==

A number of members of both houses of Congress publicly said Gonzales should resign, or be fired by Bush. Calls for his ousting intensified after his testimony on April 19, 2007. But the President gave Gonzales a strong vote of confidence saying, &quot;This is an honest, honorable man, in whom I have confidence.&quot; The President said that Gonzales&#x27;s testimony &quot;increased my confidence&quot; in his ability to lead the Justice Department. Separately, a White House spokeswoman said, &quot;He&#x27;s staying&quot;.

On May 24, 2007, Senators Charles Schumer (D-NY), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) of the Senate Judiciary Committee announced the Democrats&#x27; proposed no-confidence resolution to vote on whether &quot;Attorney General Alberto Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate and the American People.&quot;
 (The vote would have had no legal effect, but was designed to persuade Gonzales to depart or President Bush to seek a new attorney general.) A similar resolution was introduced in the House by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA).

On June 11, 2007, a Senate vote on cloture to end debate on the resolution failed (60 votes are required for cloture). The vote was 53 to 38 with 7 not voting and 1 voting &quot;present&quot; (one senate seat was vacant). Seven Republicans, John E. Sununu, Chuck Hagel, Susan Collins, Arlen Specter, Olympia Snowe, Gordon Smith and Norm Coleman voted to end debate; Independent Democrat Joseph Lieberman voted against ending debate. No Democrat voted against the motion. Not voting: Biden (D-DE), Brownback (R-KS), Coburn (R-OK), Dodd (D-CT), Johnson (D-SD), McCain (R-AZ), Obama (D-IL). Stevens (R-AK) voted &quot;present.&quot;

On July 30, 2007, MSNBC reported that Rep. Jay Inslee announced that he would introduce a bill the following day that would require the House Judiciary Committee to begin an impeachment investigation against Gonzales.

Others wrote in support of Gonzales, including the Latino Coalition and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.

* Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Vice-Chairman of Senate Democratic Conference, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee: &quot;doesn&#x27;t accept or doesn&#x27;t understand that he is no longer just the president&#x27;s lawyer,&quot; &quot;carrying out the political wishes of the President&quot; (first member of either chamber to call for ouster)

Republicans calling for Gonzales to leave:
* Sen. John E. Sununu (R-NH), first Republican to call for ouster: &quot;If I were the president, I would fire the attorney general&quot;
* Sen. Gordon Smith (R-OR): ouster &quot;would be helpful&quot;

* Sen. John Ensign (R-NV), chairman of National Republican Senatorial Committee: &quot;incompetence,&quot; &quot;they blew it&quot;

* Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME): &quot;I do not think he has served the president well&quot;
* Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), member of House Judiciary Committee: &quot;could die by a thousand cuts&quot;

Republican Senators Trent Lott and Orrin Hatch expressed support for Gonzales, although Hatch conceded that Gonzales had &quot;bungled.&quot;

===Announcement===

On August 26, 2007, Gonzales submitted his resignation as attorney general with an effective date of September 17, 2007. In a statement on August 27, Gonzales thanked the President for the opportunity to be of service to his country, giving no indication of either the reasons for his resignation or his future plans. Later that day, President Bush praised Gonzales for his service, reciting the numerous positions in Texas government, and later, the government of the United States, to which Bush had appointed Gonzales. Bush attributed the resignation to Gonzales&#x27;s name having been &quot;dragged through the mud&quot; for &quot;political reasons&quot;. Senators Schumer (D-NY), Feinstein (D-CA), and Specter (R-PA) replied that the resignation was entirely attributable to the excessive politicization of the attorney general&#x27;s office by Gonzales, whose credibility with Congress, they asserted, was nonexistent.

===Successor===
On September 17, 2007, President Bush announced the nomination of ex-Judge Michael B. Mukasey to serve as Gonzales&#x27;s successor. Bush also announced a revised appointment for acting attorney general: Paul Clement served for 24 hours and returned to his position as solicitor general; the departing assistant attorney general of the Civil Division, Peter Keisler was persuaded to stay on, and was appointed acting attorney general effective September 18, 2007.

==Post-resignation==

On September 12, 2024, Gonzales endorsed Kamala Harris for president, calling Donald Trump &quot;perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation.&quot;

===Investigations===
Soon after departure from the DOJ in September 2007, continuing inquiries by Congress and the Justice Department led Gonzales to hire a criminal-defense lawyer George J. Terwilliger III, partner at White &amp; Case, and former deputy attorney general under former president George H. W. Bush. Terwiliger was on the Republican law team involved in Florida presidential election recount battle of 2000.

On October 19, 2007, John McKay, the former U.S. Attorney for Washington&#x27;s Western District, told &quot;The (Spokane) Spokesman-Review&quot; that Inspector General Glenn A. Fine may recommend criminal charges against Gonzales. The Inspector General did not recommend criminal charges against Gonzales. To the contrary, the Inspector General found no criminal wrongdoing and no perjury.

On November 15, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that supporters of Gonzales had created a trust fund to help pay for his legal expenses, which were mounting as the Justice Department Inspector General&#x27;s office continued to investigate whether Gonzales committed perjury or improperly tampered with a congressional witness. The Inspector General determined that Gonzales did not commit perjury or improperly tamper with a congressional witness.

In July 2008, the DOJ-OIG issued a report investigating improperly politicized hirings by the attorney general&#x27;s office.

On September 2, 2008, the Inspector General found that Gonzales had stored classified documents in an insecure fashion, at his home and insufficiently secure safes at work. The Inspector General investigation found no evidence showing that there was any unauthorized disclosure of classified information resulting from his mishandling and storage of the materials in question, and the IG did not make a referral to the National Security Division for violation of a criminal statute.

Some members of Congress criticized Gonzales for selectively declassifying some of this information for political purposes. The Justice Department declined to press criminal charges.

===Later career===

In April 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Gonzales was having difficulty securing a new job, unusual for a former attorney general. Gonzales had a mediation and consulting practice in Austin, TX and taught at Texas Tech beginning in 2009. In October 2011, Belmont University College of Law announced that Gonzales would fill the Doyle Rogers Distinguished Chair of Law. Gonzalez also joined the Nashville law firm of Waller Lansden Dortch &amp; Davis, LLP as Of Counsel.

Gonzales gave an interview to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on December 31, 2008, in which he discussed the effect that controversies in his Bush Administration roles had had on his career and public perception. He stated:

Since leaving public office he has appeared on a number of television and radio news shows, including &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer&quot;, to discuss the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court, &quot;Larry King Live&quot; to discuss the challenges of immigration, and &quot;Geraldo at Large&quot; to discuss terrorism related issues. He has given numerous radio interviews on shows such as NPR&#x27;s &quot;Tell Me More&quot;, covering such topics as Guantanamo Bay and Supreme Court nominations. Additionally, he has written opinion pieces for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;, covering issues ranging from immigration to sexual predators. He stated an intention to write a book about his roles, with the intention of publishing the book &quot;for my sons, so at least they know the story.&quot; No publishing company had agreed to promote the book at the time of the interview.

Gonzales was featured in the 2008 Academy Award-winning documentary &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side.&quot; A biography of Gonzales and his controversial public life, &quot;The President&#x27;s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales,&quot; was written in 2006 by presidential biographer and historian Bill Minutaglio.

===Texas Tech University===

In 2009, Texas Tech University System hired Gonzales. He acted as the diversity recruiter for both Texas Tech University and Angelo State University. Additionally, at Texas Tech, he taught a political science &quot;special topics&quot; course dealing with contemporary issues in the executive branch, and a graduate level course to students pursuing a master&#x27;s degree in public administration. He began the new job on August 1, 2009. After the announcement, more than 40 professors at Texas Tech signed a petition opposing the hiring. Texas Tech Chancellor Kent Hance said Gonzales has generated interest in the University by recruiting outside of Lubbock and through his reputation in the news. &quot;I had a young man come up to me Monday in a restaurant and he said, &quot;I&#x27;m in Judge Gonzales&#x27;s class, and it&#x27;s the best class I&#x27;ve ever taken. Thank you for providing him to the community.&quot; Hance said.

===Grand jury indictment===
In November 2008 Gonzales was indicted by a grand jury in Willacy County in Texas. He was accused of stopping an investigation into abuses at the Willacy Detention Center, a federal detention center. Vice President Dick Cheney and other elected officials were also indicted. A judge dismissed the indictments and chastised the Willacy County district attorney, Juan Angel Gonzales, who brought the case. The district attorney himself had been under indictment for more than a year and a half before the judge dismissed the indictment. The district attorney left office after losing in a Democratic primary in March 2008. All charges were dropped after further investigation.

===International investigation===
On November 14, 2006, invoking universal jurisdiction, legal proceedings were started in Germany against Gonzales for his alleged involvement under the command responsibility of prisoner abuse by writing the controversial legal opinions.
On April 27, 2007, Germany&#x27;s Federal Prosecutor announced she would not proceed with an investigation. In November 2007, the plaintiffs appealed the decision. On April 21, 2009, the Stuttgart Regional Appeals Court dismissed the appeal.

On March 28, 2009, a Spanish court, headed by Baltasar Garzón, the judge who ordered the arrest of former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, announced it would begin an investigation into whether or not Gonzales, and five other former Bush Justice and Defense officials violated international law by providing the Bush Administration a legal framework and basis for the torture of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Garzón said that it was &quot;highly probable&quot; the matter would go to court and that arrest warrants would be issued. Also named in the Spanish court&#x27;s investigation are John Yoo, Douglas Feith, William Haynes II, Jay Bybee, and David Addington. In April 2010, on the advice of the Spanish Attorney General Cándido Conde-Pumpido, who believes that an American tribunal should judge the case (or dismiss it) before a Spanish Court ever thinks about becoming involved, prosecutors recommended that Judge Garzon should drop his investigation. As CNN reported, Mr. Conde-Pumpido told reporters that Judge Garzon&#x27;s plan threatened to turn the court &quot;into a toy in the hands of people who are trying to do a political action&quot;.

==Texas Supreme Court opinions==
This is a list of opinions in which Alberto Gonzales wrote the majority court opinion, wrote a concurring opinion, or wrote a dissent. Cases in which he joined in an opinion written by another justice are not included. A justice &quot;writes&quot; an opinion if the justice has primary responsibility for the opinion. Justices are assisted by a law clerk who may play an important role in the actual analysis of legal issues and drafting of the opinion. The Texas Supreme Court issued 84 opinions during Gonzales&#x27;s tenure on the court, according to LexisNexis.

<text>Sándor Péter Kocsis (; ; 21 September 1929 – 22 July 1979) was a Hungarian footballer who played for Ferencvárosi TC, Budapest Honvéd, Young Fellows Zürich, FC Barcelona and Hungary as a striker. During the 1950s, along with Ferenc Puskás, Zoltán Czibor, József Bozsik and Nándor Hidegkuti, he was a member of the &quot;Mighty Magyars&quot;. After the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he moved to Spain where he became a member of the FC Barcelona team of the late 1950s.

Kocsis was a prolific goalscorer for both Budapest Honvéd and Hungary. While playing for Honvéd, he was the top goalscorer in any European league in both 1952 and 1954. He also scored 75 goals in 68 appearances for Hungary – a 1.10 goal/game average at the game&#x27;s highest level. Kocsis was the top goalscorer in the 1954 World Cup with 11 goals, a record at the time for goals in a single World Cup. That year he scored 23 goals with his national team, the most by any player during a calendar year. He was also the first player to score two hat-tricks in a World Cup. His 2.2 goal/game average in the World Cup finals is second only to that of Ernst Wilimowski (Poland) who scored four goals in his only World Cup match, and only Just Fontaine has scored more goals than Kocsis in a single World Cup. He is the joint second most prolific goalscorer in national team matches in all levels in recorded history according to the Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) with 124 goals scored. Kocsis was particularly known for scoring headers.

His 1.103 goals/game average is ranked No.1 for players past 43 caps in FIFA class-A competition, closely followed by Gerd Müller with 1.097 goals/game (68 goals in 62 games). They are the only two players in history above a +1.0 goals/game average encompassing over 43 internationals. Ferenc Puskás with .99 goals/game (84 goals in 85 matches) is currently ranked 3rd.

Sándor Kocsis registered a national record of seven hat tricks for Hungary, including a four-goal haul against West Germany at the 1954 World Cup.

==Career==

===Early years===
Kocsis was born in Budapest. He began his career as a junior with Kőbányai TC, before joining Ferencváros in 1946. There, he won his first Hungarian League title in 1949. He was then conscripted into the army and joined the army club, Honvéd. His teammates at Honvéd included Ferenc Puskás, Zoltán Czibor and József Bozsik. During his time at the club he won three more Hungarian League titles in 1952, 1954 and 1955. He finished as top goalscorer in the league on three occasions in 1951, 1952 and 1954 scoring 30, 36 and 33 goals respectively. On the latter two occasions he was also the top goalscorer in any European league.

During the 1952 season at Honvéd, Kocsis was the world&#x27;s top goalscorer in world 1st division football with 36 goals. He repeated that feat in 1954 with 33 goals.

===1952 Olympics &amp; 1948–53 Central European International Cup===
Kocsis made his debut for the senior Hungary team in 1948. Together with Ferenc Puskás, Zoltán Czibor, József Bozsik and Nándor Hidegkuti, he formed the offensive nucleus of the Golden Team that went unbeaten for 32 consecutive games. The Hungarian national team suffered no defeats in Class-A international matches between 4 June 1950 and 4 July 1954, in the 1954 FIFA World Cup Final.

Kocsis scored his first international hat trick in a game against Sweden on 20 November 1949, and he scored a further one on 22 June 1952 against Finland. Kocsis also scored six goals at the Olympics in Helsinki as Hungary became Olympic Champions in 1952. On 19 October 1952, he scored his third international hat trick in a game against Czechoslovakia.

In 1953, Hungary defeated England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium and then in 1954 by 7–1 in Budapest. During the latter game, Kocsis added a further two goals. Hungary also won the 1948–53 Central European International Cup with Ferenc Puskás as top scorer.

===1954 World Cup &amp; 1955–60 Central European International Cup===

He finished the 1954 World Cup as top goalscorer, scoring 11 goals including two hat tricks, the first of the three players that achieved this. In the opening game he scored his first hat trick of the tournament against South Korea as Hungary cruised to a 9–0 win. In the next game against Germany, he went one further and scored four of the goals in an 8–3 win against the understrength team of coach Sepp Herberger. In the quarter-finals Hungary played Brazil in a game referred to as the &quot;Battle of Berne&quot;: Kocsis scored twice in an encounter which saw Hungary win 4–2. Hungary then reached the final after they defeated reigning World champions Uruguay in the semi-finals. The game was 2–2 in extra time until Kocsis scored twice to seal another 4–2 win. In the final they met Germany once again. However, for the first time in the competition Kocsis failed to score and the Germans won 3–2.

On 24 October 1954, he scored his sixth international hat trick and second against Czechoslovakia. He completed his seventh and last hat trick for Hungary on 5 November 1955 in a game against the same opponents, Sweden, that he had scored his first.

Ending the Golden years with a silver medal at the 1955-60 Central European International Cup, making it a grand total of 2 gold/titles and 2 silver for the Mighty Magyars.

===Honvéd World Tour===
In 1956 Honvéd entered the European Cup and in the first round they were drawn against Athletic Bilbao. Honvéd lost the away leg 3–2, but before the home leg could be played, the Hungarian Revolution had erupted back in Budapest. The players decided against going back to Hungary and arranged for the return with Athletic to be played at the &quot;Heysel Stadium&quot; in Brussels. Despite drawing 3–3 they went out on 6–5 on aggregate.

Elimination left Honvéd in limbo. The players summoned their families from Budapest and, despite opposition from FIFA and the Hungarian football authorities, they organised a fundraising tour of Italy, Portugal, Spain and Brazil. After returning to Europe, the players parted ways. Some, including Bozsik, returned to Hungary while others, including Czibor, Kocsis and Puskás, found new clubs in Western Europe.

===FC Barcelona and coaching career===
Kocsis spent one season with Young Fellows Zürich before another Hungarian refugee, László Kubala, persuaded him and Zoltán Czibor to join him at FC Barcelona where he became a vital member of the team. He subsequently scored on his La Liga debut in a 4–1 win over Real Betis and as part of a team that also included Ramallets, Evaristo and Luis Suárez, Kocsis won a Copa del Generalísimo and La Liga double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. FC Barcelona also reached the final of the European Cup in 1961 and this saw Czibor and Kocsis return to the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, where in 1954, while playing for Hungary, they had lost the World Cup Final and where, on 23 February 1958, Kocsis had lost 5–1 to BSC Young Boys while playing for Young Fellows Zürich. Despite both Kocsis and Czibor scoring, they finished on the losing side once again. They also lost by the same 3–2 score again, this time to S.L. Benfica.

He scored twice in the 1959 Copa del Generalísimo final as FC Barcelona defeated Granada CF 4–1. In the 1960 European Cup he scored four of the goals in a 5–2 quarter-final win over Wolves. He also scored a hat trick against Real Sociedad in a La Liga game in 1961 and scored all three goals in the 1962 Fairs Cup final that they lost to Valencia CF 7–3 on aggregate. In 1961, he also played as a guest for Valencia CF and helped them win their own summer trophy, the &quot;Trofeo Naranja&quot;. He scored in both games as Valencia beat Botafogo and FC Barcelona. Kocsis also scored in the 1963 Copa del Generalísimo final held at the Camp Nou. FC Barcelona beat Real Zaragoza 3–1.

===Later life and death===
Kocsis retired as a player in 1966 and opened a restaurant in Barcelona called &quot;Tete D’ Or&quot;. He also worked as a coach with FC Barcelona and managed Hércules CF between 1972 and 1974. However his coaching career was cut short when he was diagnosed with leukemia and then stomach cancer. On 22 July 1979, aged 49, he fell to his death from the fourth floor of a hospital in Barcelona. It has been alleged that he died of suicide, though it may have been only an accident.

<doc id="1131783" wikidata="Q7057349" url="?curid=1131783" title="North Western Ghats montane rain forests">
<text>The North Western Ghats montane rain forests is a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of southwestern Indian peninsula. It covers an area of , extending down the spine of the Western Ghauts range, from southernmost Gujarat through Damaon, Maharashtra, Goa &amp; Karnataka. The montane rain forests are found above 1000 meters elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests.

==Flora==
Unlike the lowland forests, which are composed largely of deciduous trees, the montane rain forests are predominantly evergreen laurel forest, dominated by trees of the laurel family (Lauraceae), including &quot;Litsea&quot;, &quot;Phoebe&quot;, and &quot;Cinnamomum&quot;.

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that 5,331 km2, or 17%, of the ecoregion was in protected areas. Another 39% is forested but outside protected areas. As of 1997, 13 protected areas had been designated, covering an area of 3,990 km2, 13% of the ecoregion&#x27;s area.

* Anshi National Park, Karnataka (80 km2, partly in the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests)
* Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (200 km2, partly in the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests)
* Chandoli National Park, Maharashtra (80 km2, partly in the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests)
* Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (1,060 km2)
* Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharashtra (160 km2, partly in the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests)
* Kudremukh National Park, Karnataka (820 km2)
* Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (160 km2, partly in the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests)
* Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (70 km2, partly in the South Western Ghats montane rain forests)
* Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharashtra (350 km2)
* Sharavati Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (370 km2, partly in the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests)
* Shettihalli Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (470 km2)
* Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka (40 km2)
* Tansa Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharashtra (130 km2, partly in the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests)

A chain of reserved forests – Kiribag, Subrahmanya, Bisle, Bhagimaldi, Kagneri, Kanchankumari, Kempuhole, Moorkannugudda, Kabbinale, Shiradi Shisla, and Miyar – extend along the spine of the Western Ghats, connecting Kudremukh National Park to Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary. On 15 December 2012, the Karnataka Wildlife Board recommended that Bisle, Kaginahare, and Kanchankumari reserve forests north of Pushpagiri be included in Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary. The Ministry of Environment and Forests also supported the proposal. In May 2014 wildlife biologist Sanjay Gubbi reiterated the call to include these reserve forests in the protected area, and said that &quot;a conspiracy to make money in the name of mini-hydel projects&quot; was the reason for the Karnataka state government&#x27;s refusal to redesignate these reserve forests as a wildlife sanctuary or national park.

<text>The Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak (, &quot;Kazanlǎška grobnica&quot;) is a vaulted-brickwork &quot;beehive&quot; (tholos) tomb that is located near the town of Kazanlak in central Bulgaria.

The tomb is part of a large royal Thracian necropolis in the Valley of the Thracian Rulers near their ancient capital of Seuthopolis in a region where more than a thousand tombs of royalty and members of the Thracian aristocracy can be found.

The monument dates back to the fourth century BC and has been on the UNESCO protected World Heritage Site list since 1979. The paintings in this small tomb are Bulgaria&#x27;s best-preserved artistic masterpieces from the Hellenistic period.

The site consists of a narrow corridor leading to a round, domed chamber of the size required for the burial. Both are painted and decorated with murals representing a Thracian couple at a ritual funeral feast. The murals were created in fresco. The walls were painted with a sanguine or dark reddish color.

The dome mural in this tomb shows a seated couple grasping each other&#x27;s wrists as others approach in a procession with trays and various items as well as attendees. The couple is seated separately on differing ornate chairs. Bulgarian art historian Lyudmila Zhivkova interprets the shared gesture between the central figures as indicative of a moment of tenderness and equality, but that interpretation is not shared by all specialists. Horn musicians are shown playing their instruments as they walk in the procession. The mural shows horses in several situations: saddled horses are being led or held without riders, an attendant holds the team of horses drawing an awaiting chariot, and a chariot race in progress is depicted at the top of the dome. The main border at the foundation of this dome ceiling mural features cattle skulls that are draped with scarfs of material across their horns that alternates with images of an equilateral-cross design interpreted as a flower. Among other borders that are dividing the dome mural, one band of ornamentation contains an egg-and-dart pattern of Hellenistic style while others display stripes, dentation, and imagery that may have had specific cultural or familial significance.

To preserve the delicate paintings, the tomb is not open to the public, however, a full-size and exact replica was built nearby for public access.

== In contemporary culture ==
The seated woman of the tomb mural is depicted on the reverse of the Bulgarian 50 stotinki coin that was issued in 2005.
