<doc id="1139763" wikidata="Q814334" url="?curid=1139763" title="The Hunger (1983 film)">
<text>The Hunger is a 1983 erotic horror film directed by Tony Scott in his directorial debut, starring Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie and Susan Sarandon. An international co-production of the United Kingdom and United States, the film is a loose adaptation of the 1981 novel of the same name by Whitley Strieber, with a screenplay by Ivan Davis and Michael Thomas. Its plot concerns a love triangle between a doctor who specialises in sleep and ageing research (Sarandon) and a vampire couple (Deneuve and Bowie). The film&#x27;s special effects were handled by make-up effects artist Dick Smith.

After premiering at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;The Hunger&quot; was released in the spring of 1983 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Though it received a mixed critical response, the film has accrued a cult following within the goth subculture in the years since its release.

== Plot ==
Miriam Blaylock is a vampire, seen in flashbacks drinking from victims in Ancient Egypt, promising specially chosen humans eternal life as her vampire lovers. Her current companion is John, a talented cellist whom she met in 18th-century France. In a nightclub in New York City, they connect with a young couple whom they bring home and feed upon by slashing their throats with bladed ankh pendants. The victims&#x27; bodies are disposed of in an incinerator in the basement of Miriam and John&#x27;s elegant New York townhouse, where they pose as a wealthy couple who teach classical music.

Now, 200 years after he was turned, John begins suffering insomnia and ages years in only a few days. John realises Miriam&#x27;s promise – that killing and feeding upon human victims would give him immortality – was only partially true; he will have eternal life, but not eternal youth. He seeks Dr. Sarah Roberts, a research gerontologist who, with her colleagues Charlie and Tom (also Sarah&#x27;s boyfriend), are studying the effects of rapid ageing in primates, hoping she can reverse his accelerating decrepitude. Sarah assumes that John is delusional and ignores his plea for help. As the angered John leaves the clinic, Sarah is horrified to see how rapidly he is ageing and offers her help, but John rebuffs her.

One of the Blaylocks&#x27; students, Alice Cavender, drops by their townhouse to say that she cannot attend the next day&#x27;s lesson. In a last attempt to regain his youth, John murders and feeds upon Alice, whom Miriam was grooming to be her next consort when she came of age. However, her blood does nothing to restore him, so John begs Miriam to kill him and release him from the agony of his decrepit body. Weeping, Miriam tells him there is no release. After John collapses in the basement, Miriam carries him into the attic, which is filled with coffins and places him in one. Like John, Miriam&#x27;s former vampire lovers suffer an eternal living death, helplessly moaning and trapped in their coffins. Sarah comes looking for John at his home, and Miriam claims that her husband is in Switzerland. Sarah asks to be updated on John&#x27;s condition. Later, a police official comes to the residence, looking for the missing Alice. Miriam feigns ignorance.

Sarah returns to Miriam&#x27;s home to again inquire about John. Miriam, who feels alone after losing both John and Alice, initiates a sexual encounter with Sarah, during which Miriam bites her arm and some of Miriam&#x27;s blood enters Sarah&#x27;s body. Miriam attempts to initiate Sarah in the necessities of life as a vampire, but Sarah is repulsed by the thought of subsisting on human blood.

Sarah returns home and goes out to dinner with Tom, who becomes argumentative when she rejects food and is not forthcoming about her three-and-a half-hour disappearance to the Blaylock residence. The next day at the lab, the team investigates Sarah&#x27;s blood and reveal she has some kind of infection, in the form of a foreign and inhuman type of blood, that is taking over her own. Confused, Sarah returns to confront Miriam. Still reeling from the effects of her vampiric transformation, Sarah allows Miriam to put her to bed in a guest room.

Tom arrives at Miriam&#x27;s home, looking for Sarah. Miriam shows him to the upstairs bedroom, where Sarah, starving and desperate, kills and feeds upon him. Miriam assures her that she will soon forget her old life. As the two kiss, Sarah drives Miriam&#x27;s ankh knife into her own throat and holds her mouth over Miriam&#x27;s, forcing Miriam to ingest her blood. Miriam carries Sarah upstairs, intending to place her with her other boxed lovers. A rumbling occurs and the mummies of Miriam&#x27;s previous lovers, including John, emerge from their coffins, driving her over the edge of the balcony. As she rapidly ages, the mummies become dust.

The police investigator returns to find a real estate agent showing the townhouse to prospective buyers. Sarah is now in London with two new companions, standing on the balcony of a flat in the Barbican Estate&#x27;s Cromwell Tower, admiring the view as dusk falls. From a draped coffin in a storage room, Miriam continually cries Sarah&#x27;s name.

== Cast ==

* Catherine Deneuve as Miriam Blaylock 
* David Bowie as John Blaylock 
* Susan Sarandon as Sarah Roberts
* Cliff De Young as Tom Haver
* Dan Hedaya as Lieutenant Allegrezza
* Beth Ehlers as Alice Cavender
* Rufus Collins as Charlie Humphries

Willem Dafoe and John Pankow have brief appearances as two youths harassing John Blaylock at a phone booth. John Stephen Hill and Ann Magnuson play a wild young couple whom Miriam and John pick up at a nightclub to consume at the start of the film. James Aubrey plays a man whom Miriam brings to Sarah as her potential first victim.

English gothic rock band Bauhaus appear during the film&#x27;s opening credits as a group performing at the nightclub, with Peter Murphy onscreen, where they play their single &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead.&quot; Silent film star Bessie Love makes her final film appearance as an elderly fan at Sarah&#x27;s book signing.

== Production ==
The final scene of Sarah on the balcony was added at the studio&#x27;s behest, with a view to leaving the film open-ended and allowing for possible sequels. Sarandon later expressed regret that this sequence seemed to make no sense in the context of the rest of the film: &quot;The thing that made the film interesting to me was this question of, &#x27;Would you want to live forever if you were an addict?&#x27; But as the film progressed, the powers that be rewrote the ending and decided that I wouldn&#x27;t die, so what was the point? All the rules that we&#x27;d spent the entire film delineating, that Miriam lived forever and was indestructible, and all the people that she transformed [eventually] died, and that I killed myself rather than be an addict [were ignored]. Suddenly I was kind of living, she was kind of half dying... Nobody knew what was going on, and I thought that was a shame.&quot;

Bowie was excited to work on the film but was concerned about the final product. He said &quot;I must say, there&#x27;s nothing that &quot;looks&quot; like it on the market. But I&#x27;m a bit worried that it&#x27;s just perversely bloody at some points.&quot;

== Music ==
Howard Blake was musical director on &quot;The Hunger&quot;. Although a soundtrack album accompanied the film&#x27;s release (Varèse Sarabande VSD 47261), this issue omits much of the music used in the film.

Blake noted on working with director Tony Scott, &quot;Tony wanted to create a score largely using classical music and I researched this, many days going to his home in Wimbledon with stacks of recordings to play to him. One of these was the duet for two sopranos from Delibes&#x27; &quot;Lakmé&quot;, which I recorded specially with Elaine Barry and Judith Rees, conducting my orchestra The Sinfonia of London. Howard Shelley joined with Ralph Holmes and Raphael Wallfisch to record the second movement of Schubert&#x27;s Piano Trio in E flat. Ralph recorded the Gigue from Bach&#x27;s Violin Partita in E and Raphael the Prelude to Bach&#x27;s Solo Cello Sonata in G, to which Bowie mimed. I was persuaded to appear in one scene as a pianist, for which I wrote a &#x27;Dolphin Square Blues&#x27;. Tony wanted to add a synthesizer score and I introduced him to Hans Zimmer, then working at The Snake Ranch Studio in Fulham but Tony eventually used a score by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger with electronics by David Lawson. It is hard however to exactly separate these elements.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;The Hunger&quot; was nominated for two Saturn Awards for Best Costume and Best Make-up, while receiving mixed reviews upon its release: its pacing and plot were felt to be unsatisfactory, with more emphasis seemingly being placed on cinematography and atmosphere. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described the film as &quot;an agonizingly bad vampire movie,&quot; remarking that the sex scene between Deneuve and Sarandon is effective, but that the film is so heavy on set design and scene cuts that any sense of a story is lost. In a brief review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Michael Sragow similarly called it &quot;A minor horror movie with a major modern-movie problem: director Tony Scott develops so many ingenious ways to illustrate his premise that there&#x27;s no time left to tell a story.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;The Hunger&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #15 and commented that &quot;Beautifully filmed, but boringly void of substance, &quot;The Hunger&quot; is (was) a film to be avoided like the plague.&quot;

Camille Paglia wrote in &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990) that while &quot;The Hunger&quot; comes close to being a masterpiece of a &quot;classy genre of vampire film&quot;, it is &quot;ruined by horrendous errors, as when the regal Catherine Deneuve is made to crawl around on all fours, slavering over cut throats&quot;, which Paglia considered an inappropriate focus on violence rather than sex. Critic Elaine Showalter called &quot;The Hunger&quot; a &quot;post-modernist vampire film&quot; that &quot;casts vampirism in bisexual terms, drawing on the tradition of the lesbian vampire...Contemporary and stylish, [it] is also disquieting in its suggestion that men and women in the 1980s have the same desires, the same appetites, and the same needs for power, money, and sex.&quot; David Bowie later commented about the film that &quot;the first twenty minutes rattle along like hell – it really is a great opening.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Hunger&quot; holds a 59% approval rating based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The consensus reads: &quot;Stylish yet hollow, &quot;The Hunger&quot; is a well-cast vampire thriller that mistakes erotic moments for a satisfying story.&quot;

The film grossed $6 million in the United States and Canada and $12.3 million worldwide.

== Legacy ==

&quot;The Hunger&quot; has been listed as a cult film. A retrospective review of the film by Film at Lincoln Center concluded: &quot;With its famously bold visual aesthetic—featuring high-intensity lighting, expressionistic production design, and thrillingly intimate perspectives—and the melodramatic intensity of the three lead performances, the film is an ultra-stylish time capsule, an archetype of the high-gloss, high-concept storytelling mode that prevailed in early 1980s Hollywood.&quot; The film is popular with some segments of the goth subculture and inspired a short-lived TV series of the same name, although the series has no direct plot or character connection to it.

The film has been cited by publisher Fred Berger as an influence on the creation and direction of his gothic subculture zine &quot;Propaganda&quot;, and by showrunner Bryan Fuller on his television series &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

=== Remake ===
On 23 September 2009, Warner Bros. announced it planned a remake of the film, with the screenplay written by Whitley Strieber. Warner Bros, after years of silence, shared news about the remake in 2021 with a new screenplay by Jessica Sharzer and it being produced by Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Mike McGrath.

<doc id="1139766" wikidata="Q739789" url="?curid=1139766" title="Santo Amaro, Bahia">
<text>Santo Amaro, also known as Santo Amaro da Purificação (), is a municipality in the state of Bahia in Brazil. The population is 60,131 (2020 est.) in an area of . It is located in the metropolitan area of Salvador. Santo Amaro is located approximately from the city of Salvador. Santo Amaro was home to numerous indigenous peoples until the arrival of the Portuguese, who developed the region for sugarcane production. Santo Amaro is now noted for its numerous historic structures. The city is also a center of Candomblé, having more than 60 &quot;terreiros&quot;, or temples of the religion.

==History==

Santo Amaro was home to Caeté, Pitiguaras, and Carijós peoples prior to the Portuguese colonization of Brazil. The region became an early center of sugarcane production under the Portuguese, with settlements primarily along the Subaé River. It, along with Cachoeira and Nazaré, became early regional urban and economic centers of the Recôncavo region. Santo Amaro was part of the municipality of São Francisco do Conde until 1727.

The city has numerous historic structures as a result of its colonial past, most notably the Parish Church of Our Lady of Purification (&quot;Igreja Matriz Santo Amaro da Purificação&quot;). Other historic structures include the remains of the mansions of former sugar barons and a municipal palace built in 1769. The area is noted for its nearby beaches, the Falls of Vitória, and the grotto of Bom Jesus dos Pobres. The town features prominently in the novel &quot;The War of the Saints&quot; by Jorge Amado.

===Epidemic of 1855===
A cholera epidemic occurred in 1855, killing approximately 50,000 in Santo Amaro and in Salvador. Half of the population of Santo Amaro was lost. Doctor Cypriano Barbosa Bettâmio died leading efforts to combat the disease.

==Geography==

Santo Amaro covers and borders the municipalities of Conceição do Jacuípe, Amélia Rodrigues, Feira de Santana, São Sebastião do Passé, São Francisco do Conde, Saubara, Cachoeira, and São Gonçalo dos Campos.

===Subaé River===

The Subaé River runs through much of the municipality to the Bay of All Saints. Scientists discovered large-scale lead, cadmium, and zinc pollution in the river in 1975, caused by industrial output from a factory owned by the Brazilian Lead Company (Cobrac). The factory operated from 1960 to 1993, but high levels of lead exposure remain among many segments of the population of the municipality.

==Religion==

According to the Brazilian Census of 2010, Santo Amaro is 77% Roman Catholic, 22% Evangelical, and 1% Spiritist. The statistics do not take into account Candomblé practitioners. Santo Amaro has both a large number of Candomblé terreiros (60) and a long tradition of religious syncretism between Candomblé and Roman Catholicism.

==Historic structures==

Santo Amaro is home to numerous colonial-period historic structures, many designated as Brazilian national and Bahian state monuments.

*Church of Our Lady of Protection (&quot;Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Amparo&quot;)
*Parish Church of Our Lady of Purification (&quot;Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Purificação&quot;)
*Retreat and Church of Our Lady of Humility (&quot;Recolhimento e Igreja de Nossa Senhora dos Humildes&quot;)
*Town Hall and Prison (&quot;Casa de Câmara e Cadeia&quot;)
*Santa Casa de Misericórdia of Santo Amaro
*Igreja de Nossa Senhora de Oliveira dos Campinhos
*Solar do Conde de Subaé
*Solar Paraíso
*House at Rua da Matriz, no. 9 (&quot;Sobrado à Rua da Purificação, nº 9&quot;)
*Bembé do Mercado

==Notable residents==

* Siblings Caetano Veloso (1942-) and Maria Bethânia (1946-), both singers and songwriters, were born in Santo Amaro and lived there until moving to Rio de Janeiro at the ages of 13 and 17 respectively.

<text>The Murinsel (German, literally &quot;Mur island&quot;) in Graz, Austria, is an artificial floating &quot;island&quot; in the middle of the river Mur and links the two banks on both sides. At night the blue navigation lights that surround the structure light up. This landmark of Graz was designed by New York City artist Vito Acconci on the occasion of Graz becoming the 2003 European Capital of Culture.

Described by the artist as &quot;A bowl that morphs into a dome that morphs into a bowl…&quot; Mur Island is in the form of a giant sea shell and measures in length. Two footbridges connect it with both banks of the Mur. The center of the platform forms an amphitheatre. Below a twisted round dome there is a café and a playground.

<text>Blood for Blood is an American hardcore punk band from Boston, Massachusetts. It was formed in 1994 by Erick &quot;Buddha&quot; Medina and &quot;White Trash&quot; Rob Lind, drawing inspiration from the hardcore scene in Boston and New York. In 1997, they were signed to Victory Records. The band describes its sound as influenced by Sheer Terror, Breakdown, Carnivore and Killing Time.

After their 2004 album was released, the band went on hiatus until 2010. Guitarist and songwriter Rob Lind decided touring with the band would be detrimental to his newfound sobriety, having been a heroin addict and alcoholic for many years, and feared a relapse. As a tour replacement, the band called upon Billy Graziadei from Biohazard to fill in on guitar duties in Lind&#x27;s absence.

In 2011, the band mentioned Lind&#x27;s possible return for another full-length album; however, in June 2012, vocalist Erick Medina was kicked out of the band due to being charged with raping a minor. The band has since been resurrected with Lind on vocals.

<text>Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Rummerfield (born September 7,1953) is the first spinal cord injury (SCI) quadriplegic in history to recover full physical mobility. He has numerous athletic accomplishments, and works as a motivational speaker.

==Early life==
Rummerfield was born in Vallejo, California in 1953. At an early age, Rummerfield was separated from his siblings and raised in an Idaho orphanage. He was adopted at age seven. Shortly afterwards, Rummerfield&#x27;s adoptive father enrolled him at YMCA, where he participated in athletics.

==Injury and rehabilitation==
On September 20, 1974, at age 21, Rummerfield and a friend were in a near fatal car accident while traveling at . He has admitted he had been drinking before the accident. He was paralyzed and given less than 72 hours to live. While surviving despite his doctor&#x27;s expectations, he had fractured all his ribs, broken his neck in four places, shattered his collar bone, suffered massive head injuries, and had one of his eyes placed back into its socket. As he was unable to move from the neck down, his chances of long-term survival were not good, and doctors recommended he be sent to a convalescent home. He decided not to follow the doctors&#x27; orders, and chose intensive rehabilitation. While learning to operate a wheelchair with his mouth he experienced his first rehabilitative breakthrough. He recalls, &quot;I was lying in bed one night, thinking how much I loved to play basketball and dreamed of driving a race car one day when my big toe moved.&quot; He spent the next three years learning to walk and to use his hands again.

Over the next fourteen years, he struggled with balance and coordination problems caused by the accident. He eventually regained the ability to jog and ride a bicycle without falling down. He went through six knee surgeries and total reconstruction of his right ankle and right wrist. To this day, nerve damage to the right side of his body has left him with an off-kilter gait.

Doctors have partially credited his recovery to his commitment to a then daily regimen of intensive physical therapy, including weightlifting, jump rope, and stationary bicycle. However, this level of recovery from quadriplegia was at that time unknown.

After seventeen years of intensive rehabilitation, he is now capable of essentially normal walking, despite having over 85% of his spinal cord destroyed at C-4.

Rummerfield is sometimes described as &quot;the world&#x27;s only fully recovered quadriplegic&quot;. While his physical mobility is essentially normal, Rummerfield still experiences loss of sensation in his lower legs, impaired bowel and bladder function, reduced strength in his hands, and difficulty regulating body temperature.

==Achievements==
In 1991, he began to compete in triathlons. In 1992, he participated in the IronMan Triathlon in Hawaii – a swim, bicycle ride and marathon. He became the first SCI quadriplegic to participate in and complete the Hawaii IronMan.

In 1997, he ran the Antarctica Marathon – one of only 82 people to complete the course which crosses glaciers, icy streams, rock beds and soggy beaches in sub-zero temperatures and 45 mph winds. Pat became the first SCI quadriplegic to participate and complete a marathon.

Rummerfield is the holder of the FIA World Land Speed Record for a Class III electric vehicle (over 1000 kg), at , in White Lightning, set October 22, 1999.

He is the recipient of the 2000 ESPN&#x27;s Aréte Amateur Athlete of The Year Award, the United States Marines Corps &quot;Lead By Example Medallion&quot; and the distinguished Human Spirit Award at the 2000 Christopher Reeve/Gateway To A Cure Awards Ceremonies. He has thrown out the first pitch at a Chicago Cubs baseball game. He completed the Los Angeles Marathon. He was chosen by the Coca-Cola Company to be part of the 2004 Summer Olympics torch relay, and was the national spokesman for all the runners in the relay.

He began attending racing schools, including the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving, and in October 2009 he accomplished another first by becoming the first SCI quadriplegic to participate in a professional motorsport, racing a dragster during the 2009 ADRL World Finals.

He was the first physically disabled athlete to participate and finish a stage in an adventure race, a particularly challenging athletic event.

==Motivational work and public appearances==
Rummerfield has said about his initial injury from drunk driving, &quot;I made a huge mistake and take full responsibility for my irresponsible actions.&quot;

His athletic endeavors raise money for a number of charities. He is co-founder of the NextSteps Foundation and of &quot;Adventures on Wheels&quot;.

As a lecturer, Rummerfield travels nationwide to share his story and to encourage others to set goals and to &quot;Never Give Up&quot;. Rummerfield has said, &quot;Whenever I meet someone in a wheelchair, I make a point of letting them know that there truly is nothing special about me. I am no more deserving of a miracle than anyone else.&quot;

He has appeared on Ty Pennington&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; in support of a fellow paraplegic&#x27;s recovery efforts at the Kennedy Krieger Institute.

Rummerfield was on the team at Washington University in St. Louis credited with helping Christopher Reeve regain function. He has been featured on the Discovery Channel and &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot;, among other media.

<text>Urzelina is a civil parish in the municipality of Velas in the Portuguese islands of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 902, in an area of 13.69 km². It is situated near the south coast of the island of São Jorge. It is alternately known as São Mateus, to which the parish was named after its patron saint.

==History==

The first settlers reached this coast in the 15th century, but were isolated from Faial. Many of the early homes were built along the coast, on lowlands and flanks of the interior mountain range, interspersed in the forests.

The parish received its name owing to the abundance of &quot;urzela&quot; (Roccella tinctoria) found by the first explorers and settlers, along its coastal clifftops and which later became a source of an export market, because it was used in dying. Urzela, a species of fungus, was harvested and exported to Flanders and England in the early 15th-16th centuries, thereby supporting the economies of the island, in addition to many of the islands of the Azores.

Urzelina was once a place within the parish of Manadas and elevated to parish around 1647. At the time, a decision was made to construct a port, in order to support and enhance its transitory exchange between the island and continental Portugal. It was important for the epoch, since it was one of the first ports constructed on the island at the time.

The history of Urzelina has been shaped by the events of 1 May 1808, when a volcanic eruption destroyed a great part of the settlement, and caused fear and panic in its populous. It also resulted in the destruction of most of the arable lands, and plunged the island into a period of famine. Lava reached as far as the local parochial church, which was inundated with basaltic flows and brought into ruin. The bell-tower and belfry are the only remnants of the event.

==Geography==
Urzelina is located from the town of Velas, and its centre from the islands airport. It contains the localities Canada da Bica, Canada da Feteira, Casteletes, Canada do Cruzeiro, Canada do Leitão, Maratecas, Ponta das Casteletes and Ronqueiro.

==Economy==
The region is primarily associated with agricultural activities, that include orchards, vineyards and the raising of dairy or meat cattle.

==Architecture==

<doc id="1139784" wikidata="Q5865820" url="?curid=1139784" title="History of Oxfordshire">
<text>The county of [[Oxfordshire]] in England is broadly situated in the land between the River Thames to the south, the Cotswolds to the west, the Chilterns to the east and The Midlands to the north, with spurs running south to Henley-on-Thames and north to Banbury.

Historically the area has always had some importance, containing valuable agricultural land in the centre of the country and the prestigious university in the county town of Oxford (whose name came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Oxenaford&quot; = &quot;ford for oxen&quot;). Ignored by the Romans, it was not until the formation of a settlement at Oxford in the 8th century that the area grew in importance. Alfred the Great was born across the Thames in Wantage, then in Berkshire. The University of Oxford was founded in 1096, though its collegiate structure did not develop until later on. The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century, generating much wealth, particularly in the western portions of the county in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds. Morris Motors was founded in Oxford in 1912, bringing heavy industry to an otherwise agricultural county. The importance of agriculture as an employer has declined rapidly in the 20th century though; currently under one percent of the county&#x27;s population are involved due to high mechanisation.

There are fourteen hundreds in Oxfordshire, among them being five of the Chiltern hundreds. The jurisdiction over these five belonged to the manor of Benson, and in 1199 to Robert de Harecourt, a name which is still to be found in the county in the Harcourts of Stanton Harcourt and Nuneham. The county includes small portions formerly of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, which lie in the hundreds of Bampton and Ploughley respectively.

Throughout most of its history the county was divided into fourteen hundreds, namely Bampton, Banbury, Binfield, Bloxham, Bullingdon, Chadlington, Dorchester, Ewelme, Langtree, Lewknor, Pyrton, Ploughley, Thame and Wootton.

There has been little change in the county boundary; but acts of William IV and Victoria slightly increased its area.

==Anglo-Saxon England==
The origin of the county of Oxford is somewhat uncertain; like other divisions of the Mercian kingdom, the
older boundaries were entirely wiped out, and the district was renamed after the principal town. The boundaries, except for the southern one, which is formed by the Thames, are artificial.

The district was overrun in the 6th century by the victorious West Saxons, who took Benson and Eynsham, as may be seen in the Saxon Chronicle for 571. In the 7th century the Mercians held all the northern border of the Thames, and during the 8th century this district twice changed hands, falling to Wessex after the battle of Burford, and to Mercia after a battle at Bensington.

As part of the Mercian kingdom it was included in the diocese of Lincoln. A bishopric had been established at Dorchester as early as 634, when Birinus, the apostle of Wessex, was given an episcopal seat there, but when a bishop was established at Winchester this bishopric seems to have come to an end. Before the Mercian conquest in 777, Oxfordshire was in the diocese of Sherborne. In 873 the jurisdiction of Dorchester reached to the Humber, and when the Danes were converted it extended over Leicestershire and Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire forming about an eighth of the diocese.

The Danes overran the county during the 10th century; Thorkell&#x27;s army burnt Oxford in 1010, and the combined armies of Sweyn and Olaf crossed Watling Street and ravaged the district, Oxford and Winchester submitting to them. In 1018 Danes and Englishmen chose Eadgar&#x27;s law at an assembly in Oxford, and in 1036, on Canute&#x27;s death, his son Harold Harefoot was chosen king. Here also took place the stormy meeting following the assembly (gemot) at Northampton, in which Harold Godwinson allowed his brother Tostig to be outlawed and Morkere to be chosen earl in his place, thus preparing the way for his own downfall and for the Norman Conquest.

==Norman Conquest==
The destruction of houses in Oxford recorded in the Domesday Book may possibly be accounted for by the ravages of the rebel army of Eadwine and Morkcre on this occasion, there being no undisputed mention of a siege by William the Conqueror. Large possessions in the county fell to the Conqueror, and also to his rapacious kinsman, Odo, Bishop of Winchester.

At the Norman Conquest Oxfordshire remained in the diocese of Sherborne, but in 1092 the seat of the diocese was transferred to Lincoln. The bishop of Lincoln also had extensive lands therein, while the abbeys of Abingdon, Osney and Godstow, with other religious houses, held much land in the county. Among lay tenants in chief, Robert D&#x27;Oili, heir of Wigod of Walhngford, held many manors and houses in Oxford, of which town he was governor.

By the time of the conquest the importance of Oxford was already well established; the shire moot there is mentioned in Canute&#x27;s Oxford laws, and it was undoubtedly the seat of the county court from the first, the castle being the county gaol. The principal historical events between this period and the Civil War belong less to the history of the county than to that of the city of Oxford.

==13th to 16th centuries==
The county was represented in parliament in 1289 by two members. The pestilence of 1349, the conversion of arable into pasture land caused a steady decline in prosperity from the early 14th century, when it had been second in prosperity in the kingdom, owing its wealth largely to its well-watered pastures, which bred sheep whose wool was famous all over England, and to its good supply of water power. Salt is mentioned as a product of the county in Domesday Book. Various small industries grew up, such as plush-making at Banbury, leather works at Bampton and Burford, gloves at Woodstock, and malt at Henley. Glass was made at Benson and Stokenchurch in the reign of Henry VI, and the wool trade continued, though not in so flourishing a state, Witney retaining its fame in blanket making.

The dissolution of the monasteries, though it affected the county greatly, caused no general disturbance, but the enclosure of common land in the early 16th century led to agricultural depression and discontent.

In 1542 a bishopric of Osney and Thame was established, taking its title from Oxford, the last abbot of Osney being appointed to it. In 1546 the existing bishopric of Oxford was established. The ecclesiastical boundaries remain as they were when archdeacons were first appointed — the county and archdeaconry being conterminous — and the county being almost entirely in the diocese of Oxford.

==17th century==
===English Civil War===
When King Charles I won the Battle of Edgehill (23 October 1642)—the first battle of the English Civil War—Oxford at once became the material and moral stronghold of the royalist cause. Every manor house in the district became an advanced work, and from Banbury in the north to Marlborough in the west and Reading in the south the walled towns formed an outer line of defence.

For the campaign of 1643 the role of this strong position was to be the detention of the main parliamentary army until the royalists from the north and the west could come into line on either hand, after which the united royal forces were to close upon London on all sides, and in the operations of that year Oxfordshire successfully performed its allotted functions. No serious breach was made in the line of defence, and more than once, notably at the Battle of Chalgrove Field (18 June 1643), Prince Rupert&#x27;s cavalry struck hard and successfully.

In the campaign of Newbury
which followed, the parliamentary troops under the Essex passed through north Oxfordshire on their way to the relief of Gloucester, and many confused skirmishes took place between them and Rupert&#x27;s men. When the campaign closed with the virtual defeat of the Royalists, the fortresses of the county offered them a refuge which Essex was powerless to disturb.

The following campaign witnessed a change in Charles&#x27; strategy. Realizing his numerical weakness he abandoned the idea of an envelopment, and decided to use Oxfordshire as the stronghold from which he could strike in all directions. The commanding situation of the city itself prevented any serious attempt at investment by dividing the enemy&#x27;s forces, but material wants made it impossible for Charles to maintain permanently his central position. Plans were continually resolved upon and cancelled on both sides, and eventually Essex headed for the south-west, leaving Sir William Waller to face the king alone. The Battle of Cropredy Bridge followed (29 June 1644), and the victorious king turned south to pursue and capture Essex at Lostwithiel in Cornwall.

In the remaining operations of 1644 Oxfordshire again served as a refuge and as a base (Newbury and Donnington). With the appearance on the scene of Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army a fresh interest arose. Having started from Windsor on the 20 April 1645, the future Protector carried out a daring cavalry raid. He caught and scattered the royalists unawares at Islip; then he pursued the fugitives to Bletchington and terrified the governor into surrendering. He swept right round Oxford, fought again at Bampton, and finally rejoined his chief, Fairfax, in Berkshire.

A few days later Charles again marched away northwards, while Fairfax was ordered to besiege Oxford. In spite of the difficulties of the besiegers Charles was compelled to turn back to relieve the city, and the consequent delay led to the campaign and disaster of Naseby (14 June 1645). Yet even after Naseby the actual position of Oxfordshire was practically unshaken.

It is true that Abingdon with its parliamentary garrison was a standing menace, but the districts east of the Cherwell and Thames, and the triangle bounded by Oxford, Faringdon and Banbury, still retained its importance, until early in 1646 the enemy closed from all sides on the last stronghold of royalism. The Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold witnessed the final battle of the First English Civil War. On the 9 May Banbury surrendered, and two days later Oxford itself was closely invested. On the 24 June 16e46 the city capitulated, and three days later Wallingford, the last place to give in, followed its example. The war left the county in an exceedingly impoverished condition.

==18th and 19th centuries==

In 1830 the enclosure of Otmoor led to serious riots, in which the people gathered in Oxford at St Giles&#x27; fair joined.

==20th and 21st centuries==
The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, the main army unit in the area, was based at Cowley Barracks on Bullingdon Green, Cowley.

The Vale of the White Horse district and parts of the South Oxfordshire administrative district south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire, but were added to the administrative county of Oxfordshire in 1974. Conversely, the Caversham area of Reading now belongs to Berkshire but was historically part of Oxfordshire as was the parish of Stokenchurch, now in administrative Buckinghamshire.

2007 marked the county&#x27;s 1000th birthday. Two canoes imported from Sylhet in Bangladesh were brought to Oxfordshire to host the United Kingdom&#x27;s first Nowka Bais competition. The sport became an annual cultural event of Oxfordshire, attracting thousands such as the likes of the High Commissioner of Bangladesh.

==Antiquities==
===Castles===
The remains of castles are scanty. The majority of them were probably built for defence in the Anarchy of Stephen&#x27;s reign (1100–1135), and were not maintained after
order was restored. Considerable portions of the Norman Oxford Castle survive, however, while there are slighter remains of the castle at Bampton, the seat of Aylmer de Valence in 1313.

===Mansions===
Among remains of former mansions there may be noted the 14th century Greys Court near Henley-on-Thames, Minster Lovell, on the Windrush above Witney, and Rycote, between Thame and Oxford. Minster Lovell, the extensive ruins of which make an exquisite picture by the river-side, was the seat of Francis, Lord Lovel, who, being the son of a Lancastrian father, incurred the hatred of that party by serving Richard III, and afterwards assisted the cause of Lambert Simnel, mysteriously disappearing after the Battle of Stoke. The remains of Rycote (partly incorporated with a farmhouse) are of fine Elizabethan brick, and in the chapel attached to the manor there is remarkable Jacobean woodwork, the entire fittings of the church, including the canopied pews and altar-table, being of this period. Here Princess [Elizabeth was kept in 1554, before her accession, and afterwards resided as Queen.

Of ancient mansions still inhabited at the start of the 20th century, the finest is Broughton Castle near Banbury, dating from 1301. Others are Shirburn Castle, begun in 1377, but mainly Perpendicular of the next century; Stanton Harcourt, dating from 1450, with a gatehouse of 1540, a vast kitchen, and Pope&#x27;s Tower, named from the poet, who stayed here more than once. Mapledurham, on the Thames above Reading, is a fine Tudor mansion of brick; and Water Eaton, on the Cherwell above Oxford, is a singularly perfect Jacobean house of stone, with a chapel of the same period resembling pure Perpendicular.

Other mansions in the county include Blenheim Palace, near Woodstock; the former Holton House (now replaced by a Georgian building), near Wheatley, was the scene in 1646 of the wedding of the Parliamentary Major General Henry Ireton and Bridget daughter of Oliver Cromwell.

===Ecclesiastical===
The university had a significant influence upon the ecclesiastical history of Oxfordshire. A large number of monastic foundations arose, such as those of Augustinian canons at Bicester, Caversham, Cold Norton, Dorchester, Osney (a foundation just outside the walls of Oxford) and Wroxton; of Cistercians, at Bruern and Thame; of Benedictines, at Cogges, Eynsham, Milton; of Mathurins, at NuflSeld; of Gilbertines, at Clattercote; of Templars, at Sandford-on-Thames. There was at Gosford one of the only two preceptories of female Templars in England. Of all these, excepting the abbey church at Dorchester, remains are scanty. A few domestic buildings remain at Studley; the boundary walls still stand of Godstow Nunnery on the Thames, the retreat and burial-place of Rosamund Clifford or &quot;Fair Rosamund,&quot; the object of Henry II&#x27;s famous courtship; and there are traces of Rewley Abbey within Oxford.

In ecclesiastical architecture Oxfordshire, apart from Oxford itself, is rich, but there is no dominant style, nearly all the churches being of mixed dates. In fact, of the most important churches only Iffley, Adderbury and Minster Lovell need be taken as types of a single style. Iffley, south of Oxford, is one of the finer examples of pure Norman in England, with an ornate west front. Adderbury, south of Banbury, has a massive central tower and spire. The parish church of Minster Lovell is pure Perpendicular style; its central tower is supported on four detached piers.

One feature common to several churches in the county are spires. The short ungainly spire of Oxford cathedral was among the earliest, if not the first, constructed in England, and served as a model from which were probably developed the splendid central spires of the great churches at Witney, Bampton, Shipton-under-Wychwood and Bradwell. There are also three fine spires in the north: Bloxham, Adderbury and
King&#x27;s Sutton (across the border in Northamptonshire), which are locally proverbial as typifying length, strength and beauty. Bloxham church, mainly decorated with Norman portions and an Early English west front, is one of the largest in the county. In the west, Burford (Norman and later) is noteworthy, and in the porch of the Norman church of Langford is seen the rare feature of a crucifix with the figure cloaked.

At South Leigh, there are mural paintings of the 15th century. About north of Oxford there are Kidlington with a needle-like Perpendicular spire, and Islip, which, as the birthplace of Edward the Confessor, retains a connection with his Abbey of Westminster (the Dean and Chapter of which are lords of the manor and patrons of the living). In the south-east, Dorchester Abbey, with its nave of transitional Norman, has a curious decorated Jesse window, the tracery representing the genealogical tree of the patriarch.

At Cuddcsdon there is another large cruciform church, Norman and later. Ewelme church (Perpendicular) is
remarkable for the tomb of Alice, Duchess of Suffolk (1475), with tracery and gilded canopy, and that of Sir Thomas Chaucer (1434), ornamented with enamelled coats of arms. Here William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, founded in 1436 the picturesque hospital and free school still standing.

<text>Alfred Einstein (December 30, 1880February 13, 1952) was a German-American musicologist and music editor. He was born in Munich, and fled Nazi Germany after Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;, arriving in the United States by 1939. He is best known for being the editor of the first major revision of the Köchel catalogue, which was published in 1936. The Köchel catalogue is the extensive catalogue of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

==Biography==
Einstein was born in Munich. Though he originally studied law, he quickly realized his principal love was music, and he acquired a doctorate at Munich University, focusing on instrumental music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, in particular music for the viola da gamba. In 1918 he became the first editor of the &quot;Zeitschrift für Musikwissenschaft&quot;; slightly later he became music critic for the &quot;Münchner Post&quot;; and in 1927 became music critic for the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;. In this period he was also a friend of the composer Heinrich Kaspar Schmid in Munich and Augsburg. In 1933, after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, he left Nazi Germany, moving first to London, then to Italy, and finally to the United States in 1939, where he held a succession of teaching posts at universities including Smith College, Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Michigan, and the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Connecticut.

Einstein not only researched and wrote detailed works on specific topics, but wrote popular histories of music, including the &quot;Short History of Music&quot; (1917), and &quot;Greatness in Music&quot; (1941). In particular, due to his depth of familiarity with Mozart, he published an important and extensive revision of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart&#x27;s music (1936). It is this work for which Einstein is most well known. Einstein also published a comprehensive, three-volume set &quot;The Italian Madrigal&quot; (1949) on the secular Italian form, the first detailed study of the subject. His 1945 volume &quot;Mozart: His Character, His Work&quot; was an influential study of Mozart and is perhaps his best known book.

==Relationship to Albert Einstein==
While one source (1980) lists Alfred as a cousin of the scientist Albert Einstein, another claims (1993) that no relationship has been verified. Some websites claim they were both descended from a Moyses Einstein seven generations back, hence they were sixth cousins. In 1991, Alfred&#x27;s daughter Eva stated that they were not related. On the other hand, she wrote in 2003 that they were fifth cousins on one side, and fifth cousins once removed on the other, according to research by George Arnstein. They were photographed together in 1947 when Albert Einstein received an honorary doctorate from Princeton, but they did not know that they were distantly related.

<doc id="1139793" wikidata="Q312945" url="?curid=1139793" title="Dámaso Alonso">
<text>Dámaso Alonso y Fernández de las Redondas (22 October 1898 – 25 January 1990) was a Spanish poet, philologist and literary critic. Though a member of the Generation of &#x27;27, his best-known work dates from the 1940s onwards.

==Early life and education==
Born in Madrid on 22 October 1898, Alonso studied Law, Philosophy and Literature before undertaking research at Madrid&#x27;s Centro de Estudios Históricos. An enthusiastic participant in the cultural and literary life at the famous Residencia de estudiantes (which at this time counted among its residents Federico García Lorca, Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí, amongst others), Alonso also wrote for the literary magazines &quot;Revista de Occidente&quot; (&#x27;Western Review&#x27;) and &quot;Los Cuatro Vientos&quot; (&#x27;The Four Winds&#x27;).

==Academic career==
Alonso was to become an academic of great renown: he taught Spanish language and literature at several foreign universities, including the University of Oxford and took up a chair at the University of Valencia between 1933 and 1939 before moving to the University of Madrid. He was elected to the Real Academia Española in 1945 and served as its director between 1968 and 1982, when he was named director emeritus.

==Literary career==
Alonso&#x27;s literary career can essentially be split into two convenient blocks. As a poet his early work (such as 1921&#x27;s &quot;Poemas puros; Poemillas de la ciudad&quot; and 1925&#x27;s &quot;El viento y el verso&quot;) is widely considered inferior to that of his fellow poets in the Generation of &#x27;27, and he himself acknowledged his limitations by referring to himself as a &#x27;poeta de rachas&#x27; or &#x27;part-time poet&#x27;. His mature work, however, particularly &quot;Hijos de la ira&quot; (&#x27;Children of Wrath&#x27;, 1944, 2nd ed. 1946), is recognised as fundamental in the literature of the post-Civil War years.

Alonso&#x27;s later poetry is also full of agnostic anguish—of a man in search of God, yet fearful of the implications were this God not to exist.

As a literary critic Alonso&#x27;s impact was substantial; in particular he is credited with revolutionizing the study of Spanish Baroque poetry, particularly the work of Góngora, and his critical work was praised for its intellectual rigour. Highlights include &quot;Poesía de San Juan de la Cruz&quot; (1942), &quot;Poesía española: Ensayo de métodos y límites estilísticos&quot; (1950) and &quot;Estudios y ensayos gongorinos&quot; (1955).

==Awards and honors==
Alonso was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1962. In 1978, he was awarded the Premio Cervantes, the Spanish literary world&#x27;s highest honour.

<text>The Michael Tuck Medal was awarded to the best-and-fairest player in the AFL Pre-season Cup Final. The award was presented annually between 1992 and 2013; since 2014, the award has not been presented due to the preseason being structured without a final. It is named after Michael Tuck, who played 426 senior matches for between 1972 and 1991 and was the VFL/AFL games record holder until being surpassed by Brent Harvey in Round 19, 2016.

==Recipients==
&quot;Italics&quot; - denotes winner from losing team of that Grand Final.

==Trivia==
*Adelaide&#x27;s Simon Goodwin is the only player to win the medal despite playing in the losing side when they were defeated by Geelong in 2006.
*Nick Stevens is the only player to win two Michael Tuck medals. He won the award in 2002 with , and in 2007 with .
*Tuck committed an amusing &quot;faux pas&quot; in 2005, when he himself accidentally referred to the medal as the Norm Smith Medal while presenting it (the Norm Smith Medal is awarded to the best-and-fairest player in the &quot;premiership season grand final&quot;). He has alluded to this mistake prior to awarding the medal in future seasons by emphasising his name; in 2009 his words were &quot;my name is &quot;Michael Tuck&quot;, and the winner of the &quot;Michael Tuck Medal&quot; is Joel Selwood.&quot;

<text>Leonard William Barden (born 20 August 1929, in South Croydon, London) is an English chess master, writer, broadcaster, journalist, organizer and promoter. The son of a dustman, he was educated at Whitgift School, South Croydon, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read modern history. Barden learned to play chess at age 11 while in a school shelter during a World War II German air raid. Within a few years he became one of the country&#x27;s leading juniors. Barden represented England in four Chess Olympiads. He played a major role in the rise of English chess from the 1970s. Barden is a chess columnist for various newspapers. His column in London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; was the world&#x27;s longest-running daily chess column by the same author.

==Early life==
Barden was born in South Croydon on 20 August 1929. His father ran a business which collapsed during the Great Depression, and eventually found employment as a dustman. Leonard attended Whitgift School when it was a grammar school, before it reverted to independent status in 1946.

==Playing career==

===Junior results===
In 1946, Barden won the British Junior Correspondence Chess Championship, and tied for first place in the London Boys&#x27; Championship. The following year he tied for first with Jonathan Penrose in the British Boys&#x27; Championship, but lost the playoff.

===British results===
Barden finished fourth at Hastings in 1951–52. In 1952, he won the Paignton tournament ahead of the Canadian future grandmaster Daniel Yanofsky. Barden captained the Oxfordshire team which won the English Counties championship in 1951 and 1952. In the latter year, he captained the University of Oxford team which won the National Club Championship, and he represented the university in the annual team match against the University of Cambridge during his years there. In 1953, Barden won the individual British Lightning Championship (ten seconds a move). The following year, he tied for first with the Belgian grandmaster Albéric O&#x27;Kelly de Galway at Bognor Regis; was joint British champion, with Alan Phillips; and won the Southern Counties Championship. Barden finished fourth at Hastings 1957–58, which Chessmetrics ranks as his best statistical performance. In the 1958 British Chess Championship, Barden again tied for first, but lost the playoff match to Penrose 1½–3½.

===Chess Olympiads===
Barden represented England in the Chess Olympiads at Helsinki 1952 (playing , scoring 2 wins, 5 draws, and 4 losses), Amsterdam 1954 (playing first reserve, scoring 1 win, 2 draws, and 4 losses), Leipzig 1960 (first reserve; 4 wins, 4 draws, 2 losses), and Varna 1962 (first reserve; 7 wins, 2 draws, 3 losses). The latter was his best performance by far.

===Morphy number===
Barden has a Morphy number of 3 by six different routes. He drew with Jacques Mieses in the Premier Reserves at Hastings 1948–49. Mieses drew with Henry Bird in the last round of Hastings 1895, and Bird played a number of games with Paul Morphy in 1858 and 1859. Mieses also beat Louis Paulsen at Breslau 1889. Morphy and Paulsen played at least 11 games against each other in 1857. Barden also played four opponents of James Mortimer: Edward Sergeant, Savielly Tartakower, Sir George Thomas, and Eugene Znosko-Borovsky. Mortimer reportedly played Morphy many games in Paris during the 1850s and 1860s.

==Chess organisation, broadcasting, writing==
In 1964, Barden gave up most competitive chess to devote his time to chess organisation, broadcasting, and writing about the game. He has made invaluable contributions to English chess as a populariser, writer, organiser, fundraiser, and broadcaster.

He was controller of the British Chess Federation Grand Prix for many years, having found its first sponsor, Cutty Sark whisky. He was a regular contributor to the BBC&#x27;s Network Three weekly radio chess programme from 1958 to 1963. His best-known contribution was a consultation game, recorded in 1960 and broadcast in 1961, where he partnered Bobby Fischer against the English masters Jonathan Penrose and Peter Clarke. This was the only recorded consultation game of Fischer&#x27;s career. The game, unfinished after eight hours of play, was adjudicated a draw by former world champion Max Euwe. Barden gave BBC television commentaries on all the games in the 1972 world championship. From 1973 to 1978 he was co-presenter of BBC2&#x27;s annual Master Game televised programme.

===Chess columns===
Barden&#x27;s weekly column has been published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; since September 1955 (for 69 years and 3 months as of December 2024) and in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; since March 1974 (for 50 years and 7 months as of December 2024). A typical Barden column not only contains a readable tournament report, but is geared toward promoting the game. His &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; column began in June 1956, and was published daily, firstly in print and subsequently online, until January 31, 2020. It is by far the world&#x27;s longest running daily chess column by the same author, the previous record having been set by George Koltanowski in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;: 51 years, 9 months, and 18 days, including posthumous articles. Barden&#x27;s column ran for 63 years, 7 months and 27 days, which exceeds the world record of 45 years and 240 days (as of 28 February 2019) that Guinness World Records recognizes for Lam Shan Muk of Hong Kong, a daily commentator for the &quot;Hong Kong Economic Journal&quot;.

In 2024, FIDE, the world chess federation, gave Barden a &quot;FIDE 100 Award&quot; for &quot;Best Journalist&quot;.

==Role in &quot;English Chess Explosion&quot;==
Barden played a key role in the rapid advance of English chess in the 1970s and 1980s from also-rans to Olympiad silver medal winners. His involvement began in 1971 when he noticed that Tony Miles and Michael Stean were both likely contenders for the 1973 world junior (under-20) championship, but that the only way for a country to have two representatives was to host the event. Barden knew the financier Jim Slater, who offered to co-sponsor the event, which was staged at Teesside. Miles and Stean won the silver and bronze medals there. Miles won the championship the following year. Slater also agreed to Barden&#x27;s proposal that he should finance special coaching by Bob Wade for the five best teenage prospects. They all became grandmasters.

In 1972, after Slater had saved the world championship match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky from collapse by doubling the prize fund, he offered £5,000 to the first English grandmaster (who wound up being Miles), and £2,500 to each of the next four players to qualify. Barden worked out the detailed terms, and wrote the speech at Hastings where Slater announced the awards. Encouraged by success, Barden and Slater then agreed on a wider programme to stimulate talent at much younger ages, aiming to produce a generation which could compete with the Soviet Union, the world&#x27;s leading chess nation.

Barden organised weekend junior invitation events at which the best prospects played a tournament and had coaching from masters between games. They were also introduced to top master chess at the annual Evening Standard weekend open and via grandmaster simultaneous exhibitions. The model was the USSR&#x27;s own programme in the 1930s, when future masters scored impressively in exhibitions against world-class masters José Raúl Capablanca and Salo Flohr during the 1935 and 1936 Moscow tournaments. Very few juniors in the 1970s had international ratings, so Barden compiled his own world ranking lists for every age group from under-18 to under-10, updating the figures at monthly or weekly intervals and posting the results at the invitation events.

Barden read much Soviet chess literature, and in 1974 decided that an 11-year-old then named Gary Wainstein was a likely future world champion. His &quot;Guardian&quot; column of 24 February 1975, headlined &quot;World Champ 1990&quot;, made this a specific forecast. It was, by more than a year, the first such prediction by anyone for the future Garry Kasparov, who beat Barden&#x27;s forecast by five years when he won the title in 1985.

By summer 1975 Barden believed that Nigel Short, then aged 9, also had world title potential. The simultaneous programme was intensified for Short, who in the next few years played three world champions and several other top grandmasters. Barden also used his columns to promote his juniors, whom some called &quot;the Barden babes&quot;. When Short defeated Viktor Korchnoi, the world&#x27;s second strongest active player, in a 1976 Evening Standard simultaneous the result was announced on that evening&#x27;s ITN news bulletin.

One purpose of the publicity was to attract more sponsorship, and in summer 1976 Barden secured backing from Lloyds Bank. The bank&#x27;s chairman, Sir Jeremy Morse, was an eminent chess problemist, and its sponsorship manager, Pat Bowman, liked the concept of the bank financing a serious challenge to Soviet chess supremacy.

The first Lloyds Bank event was a pilot, a London vs. New York City telex match, to celebrate the United States Bicentennial, in which the American captain agreed to Barden&#x27;s proposal to include extra under-11 boards, on one of which Short (who lived near Manchester) beat the future US champion Joel Benjamin. By then many juniors were advancing towards master strength, but lacked official FIDE international ratings and titles. So in 1977 the annual Lloyds Bank Masters in London was launched, modelled on a successful US event at Lone Pine where the best US juniors competed against grandmasters. This legendary Open lasted until 1994 (18th edition, won by Alexander Morozevich). Barden also organised an all-play-all tournament, the Lord John Cup in London, where three young and promising English masters – John Nunn, Michael Stean and Jonathan Mestel – met such grandmasters as tournament-winner Vlastimil Hort,Miguel Quinteros, Eugenio Torre, and the legendary Alexander Kotov.

By 1978, when England won the World Student Team Chess Championship at Mexico City ahead of the USSR, and a group financed by Lloyds Bank performed strongly at Lone Pine, the golden generation was on the way to the Olympiad silver medals achieved in 1984, 1986 and 1988. Barden continued to seek new primary school talent, and in 1980 recognised the exceptional promise of the then 8-year-old Michael Adams. Adams lived in Cornwall, far from the major chess centres, so Barden arranged for a Devon organiser, Ken Butt, to stage an annual Lloyds Bank under-18 international tournament in Plymouth. Adams first played there at age 10, and by 12 missed an international master result by only half a point in his Lloyds Bank Masters debut where, in line with Barden&#x27;s policy of matching the best talents against top grandmasters, he also performed well in a blitz game against Spassky.

By the 1980s the &quot;English Chess Explosion&quot; was in full swing, but Barden took a lesser role due to having to care for his mother, who suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He still spotted talents early, notably Matthew Sadler, who debuted in the Lloyds Bank tournament at 11 and became a leading grandmaster in the 1990s. In 1992 when the British Chess Federation was reluctant to send Luke McShane, then 8, to the 1992 world under-10 championship in Duisburg, Barden campaigned for a positive outcome which was rewarded when McShane won the gold medal. In 1988–90, he managed the early programme for David Howell, then 8, who at 16 became the United Kingdom&#x27;s youngest grandmaster.

In recognition of his efforts, Barden was offered an OBE, but declined it.

==Chess strength==
According to Chessmetrics, Barden&#x27;s best single performance was at Hastings 1957–58, where he finished fourth behind Paul Keres, Svetozar Gligorić and Miroslav Filip, scoring 5/9 (56%). At his peak, he was likely at or close to International Master strength, but never formally received this title from FIDE. Chessmetrics assigned Barden a peak retrospective rating of 2497 for January 1958, number 187 in the world. FIDE did not introduce international ratings until 1970, after Barden had virtually stopped competing.

==Notable games==

* Barden considers his best game to be his win against Čeněk Kottnauer (Black) at Ilford Premier 1960: 

* Barden called his win against Weaver Adams (Black) at Hastings 1950–51 &quot;my favourite game&quot;:

* Here Barden annihilates Jonathan Penrose, who won a famous game against reigning World Champion Mikhail Tal the following year, and ultimately won the British Chess Championship a record ten times:

<doc id="1139804" wikidata="Q5742772" url="?curid=1139804" title="Hero and Leander (poem)">
<text>Hero and Leander is a poem by Christopher Marlowe that retells the Greek myth of Hero and Leander. After Marlowe&#x27;s untimely death, it was completed by George Chapman. The minor poet Henry Petowe published an alternative completion to the poem. The poem was first published five years after Marlowe&#x27;s demise.

==Publication==
Two editions of the poem were issued in quarto in 1598 (see 1598 in poetry); one, printed by Adam Islip for the bookseller Edward Blount, contained only Marlowe&#x27;s original, while the other, printed by Felix Kingston for Paul Linley, included both the original and Chapman&#x27;s continuation. A third edition in 1600, published by John Flasket, printed a title-page advertising the addition of Marlowe&#x27;s translation of Book I of Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; to the original poem, though the book itself merely adds Chapman&#x27;s portion. The fourth edition of 1606, again from Flasket, abandoned any pretence of including the Lucan and once again joined Marlowe&#x27;s and Chapman&#x27;s poems together; this was the format followed in subsequent 17th-century editions (1609, 1613, 1629, 1637 and after).

==Story==

Marlowe&#x27;s poem relates the Greek legend of Hero and Leander, young lovers living in cities on opposite sides of the Hellespont, a narrow stretch of the sea in what is now northwestern Turkey, and which separates Europe and Asia. Hero is a priestess or devotee of Venus (goddess of love and beauty) in Sestos, who lives in chastity despite being devoted to the goddess of love. At a festival in honour of her deity, Venus and Adonis, she is seen by Leander, a youth from Abydos on the opposite side of the Hellespont. Leander falls in love with her, and she reciprocates, although cautiously, as she has made a vow of chastity to Venus.

Leander convinces her to abandon her fears. Hero lives in a high tower overlooking the water; he asks her to light a lamp in her window, and he promises to swim the Hellespont each night to be with her. She complies. On his first night&#x27;s swim, Leander is spotted by Neptune (Roman god of the sea), who confuses him with Ganymede and carries him to the bottom of the ocean. Discovering his mistake, the god returns him to shore with a bracelet supposed to keep him safe from drowning. Leander emerges from the Hellespont, finds Hero&#x27;s tower and knocks on the door, which Hero then opens to find him standing stark naked. She lets him &quot;whisper in her ear, / Flatter, entreat, promise, protest, and swear,&quot; and after a series of coy, half-hearted attempts to &quot;defend the fort&quot; she yields to bliss. The poem breaks off as dawn is breaking.

No critical consensus exists on the issue of how Marlowe, had he lived, would have finished the poem, or indeed if he would have finished it at all.

==Genre, source, and style==

The poem may be called an epyllion, that is, a &quot;little epic&quot;: it is longer than a lyric or elegy, but concerned with love rather than with traditional epic subjects, and it has a lengthy digression – in this case, Marlowe&#x27;s invented story of how scholars became poor. Marlowe certainly knew the story as told by both Ovid and by the Byzantine poet Musæus Grammaticus; Musaeus appears to have been his chief source.

Yet if Musaeus and Ovid gave it impetus, the poem is marked by Marlowe&#x27;s unique style of extravagant fancy and violent emotion. Perhaps the most famous instance of these qualities in the poem is the opening description of Hero&#x27;s costume, which includes a blue skirt stained with the blood of &quot;wretched lovers slain&quot; and a veil woven with flowers so realistic that she is continually forced to swat away bees. The final encounter of the two lovers is even more frenzied, with the two at times appearing closer to blows than to embraces.

==Adaptation==
In &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot;, Ben Jonson lampoons the poem in the fair&#x27;s puppet show; his Hellespont is the River Thames, and his Leander is a dyer&#x27;s son in Puddle-wharf. A poem based to some extent on Marlowe&#x27;s text was set to music around 1628 by the composer Nicholas Lanier; this may have been one of the earliest works in recitative in English. King Charles I was fond of the work, and had Lanier perform it repeatedly; Samuel Pepys also admired it, and had it transcribed by his &quot;domestic musician&quot;, Cesare Morelli. &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; is also the only identifiable work of a contemporary writer quoted in any of the plays of William Shakespeare, specifically in &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

<text>is a civil parish along the southwestern coast of the municipality of Madalena on the island Portuguese island of Pico, in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 772, in an area of 17.37 km².

==History==

It is known, from oral investigations, that one of the first civil parishes created on the island of Pico was dedicated to the apostle Mathew, and which extended along the southern coast in an area considerably larger than today&#x27;s limits. It was, then, part of the locality of &quot;Arruda&quot;, its centre from Lajes, and whose name was derived from a medicinal plant discovered in the region.

==Geography==

Connected to the two principal centers (Madalena on the west coast and Lajes on the south coast) by the Regional E.R.1-1ª roadway, the parish is wedged between the parishes of São Caetano and Candelária. The pie-shaped parish extends from the southern coast to the interior, sloping from rugged cliffs to the mountainous summit of Ponta do Pico. While farmlands and settlements occupy most of the areas along the roadways, the dense forest occupies the majority of its territory.

In addition to the parish center of São Mateus (location of the primary school, commercial businesses and civil government), located near the São Caetano border, the coastal village of Areeiro in the southwest corner and the interior hamlet of Ginjeira, are the predominant rural agglomerations. Other localities are Badgaço, Canada Nova, Grotas, Grotas de Cima, Mata, Paço, Ponta da Calheta, Porto Novo, Porto de São Mateus, Pontinha, Relvas and Rua dos Caldeirões.

==Architecture==

* Chapel of the São Mateus Cemetery (), located on the &quot;Rua da Boa Vista&quot; and constructed in the 19th century (1890), the cemetery consists of a Baroque-style facade with arched doorway, flanked by two rounded windows, preceded by the long wall corridors of the cemetery and Gothic-like entrance gate.
* Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (), constructed in 1753, consisting of a single nave buildings with simple triangular frontspeice surmounted by cross. Alongside is a complementary simple bell-tower with two rounded-arch bellrey over rectangular doorway.
* Church of Bom Jesus Milagroso (), often believed to be dedicated to Saint Mathew, the parochial church in this parish is actually dedicated to the &quot;Miraculous Jesus Christ&#x27;, its present facade completed in 1842.

<text>The history of the English county of Rutland, located in the East Midlands. It was reconstituted as a district of Leicestershire in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. This district was given unitary authority status on 1 April 1997.

==Early history==
The north-western part of the county of Rutland was recorded as Rutland, a detached part of Nottinghamshire, in the Domesday Book; the south-eastern part as the wapentake of &quot;Wicelsea&quot; in Northamptonshire. It was first mentioned as a separate county in 1159, but as late as the 14th century it was referred to as the &#x27;Soke of Rutland&#x27;.

In 1584 Uppingham School and Oakham School, two of the earliest public schools of England, were founded in Rutland with a hospital, or almshouse, by Archdeacon Robert Johnson. Both of the original school buildings remain standing.

Earl of Rutland and Duke of Rutland are titles in the peerage of England held in the Manners family, derived from the traditional county of Rutland. The Earl of Rutland was elevated to the status of Duke in 1703 and the titles were merged. The family seat is at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire.

==Modern history==

By the time of the 19th century it had been divided into the hundreds of Alstoe, East, Martinsley, Oakham and Wrandike.

Rutland covered parts of three poor law unions and rural sanitary districts (RSDs): those of Oakham, Uppingham and Stamford. The registration county of Rutland contained the entirety of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs, which included several parishes in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire – the eastern part in Stamford RSD was included in the Lincolnshire registration county. Rutland gained its own county council by virtue of the Local Government Act 1888

In 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894 the rural sanitary districts were partitioned along county boundaries to form three rural districts. The part of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs in Rutland formed the Oakham Rural District and Uppingham Rural District, with the two parishes from Oakham RSD in Leicestershire becoming part of the Melton Mowbray Rural District, the 9 parishes of Uppingham RSD in Leicestershire becoming the Hallaton Rural District, and the 6 parishes of Uppingham RSD in Northamptonshire becoming Gretton Rural District. Meanwhile, that part of Stamford RSD in Rutland became the Ketton Rural District. Oakham was split out from Oakham Rural District in 1911 as an urban district.

In the Second World War, the county became home to three Royal Air Force stations, opened at Cottesmore, North Luffenham and Woolfox Lodge. While the latter closed in 1966, the others retained a major defence function in the hands of the British Army when Cottesmore became home of Kendrew Barracks in 2012, and North Luffenham of St George&#x27;s Barracks in 1998.

The Local Government Boundary Commission (1945–1949) recommended merger with Leicestershire. Rutland was included in the &quot;East Midlands General Review Area&quot; of the 1958–1967 Local Government Commission for England. Draft recommendations would have seen Rutland split, with Ketton Rural District going along with Stamford to a new administrative county of Cambridgeshire, and the western part be added to Leicestershire. The final proposals were less radical and instead proposed that Rutland become a single rural district within the administrative county of Leicestershire. This victory was to prove only temporary, with Rutland being included in the new non-metropolitan county of Leicestershire under the Local Government Act 1972, from 1 April 1974. Under proposals for non-metropolitan districts Rutland would have been paired with what now constitutes the Melton district – the revised and implemented proposals made Rutland a standalone non-metropolitan district (breaking the 40,000 minimum population barrier).

In 1994, the Local Government Commission for England, which was conducting a structural review of English local government, recommended that Rutland become a unitary authority. This was implemented on 1 April 1997, with Rutland regaining a separate Lieutenancy as well as its council regaining control of county functions such as education and social services. The council remained formally a non-metropolitan district council, with wards rather than electoral divisions, but has renamed the district to &#x27;Rutland County Council&#x27; to allow it to use that name. This means the full legal name of the council is Rutland County Council District Council.

<text>The National Union of Ship&#x27;s Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers was the principal trade union for service personnel serving aboard British merchant ships between 1909 and 1921.

It was formed in Liverpool in 1909 by Joe Cotter, a former Cunard steward. Over the years which followed it developed a strong following in the liner ports of Southampton, Glasgow, London, Bristol and Hull. In 1911 the union supported the seamen&#x27;s strikes which broke out in all major British ports.

In 1921, the National Maritime Board imposed wage reductions for marine workers with the support and assistance of the principal seamen&#x27;s union, the National Sailors&#x27; and Firemen&#x27;s Union. The National Union of Ship&#x27;s Stewards refused to endorse this move and instead supported attempts to resist the reductions. Much weakened by these efforts, the Stewards&#x27; Union amalgamated at the end of 1921 with the British Seafarers&#x27; Union to form the Amalgamated Marine Workers&#x27; Union.

<text>Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini (10 August 1797 – 18 February 1848) was a German botanist, Professor of Botany at the University of Munich. He worked extensively with Philipp Franz von Siebold, assisting in describing his collections from Japan, but also described plants discovered in other areas, including Mexico. Siebold wrote his &quot;Flora Japonica&quot; in collaboration with Zuccarini. It first appeared in 1835, but the work was not completed until after his death, finished in 1870 by F. A. W.

<text>Asymmetric Publications is a video game developer and publisher. It made the web-based role-playing game &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;.

Asymmetric is run by Zack Johnson (known as Jick in-game). Employees of the company are known as the Asymmetric Team. As a result of the popularity of the game, Asymmetric currently supports Johnson and a few other individuals as full-time employees.

In the past, Asymmetric Publications hosted various games and other attractions, including &quot;Infinity Plus One&quot;, an online fortune teller, &quot;Bee On Drugs&quot;, a bee who rambles, and &quot;Krakrox the Barbarian&quot;, a game noted as the precursor to &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;.

A running gag was that the Asymmetric Publications&#x27; website was not updated for almost six years after the announcement of a &quot;fun new game,&quot; &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;. In late 2008, it began to be updated again.

The employees of Asymmetric Publications formerly produced several weekly podcasts. One of them was related to Kingdom of Loathing, while the others were general shows about video games, pop culture, advice, and parenting. These latter podcasts were collected under an umbrella called the &quot;Hot Dog Network&quot;.

A second game, &quot;Word Realms&quot; was developed between 2008 and 2012, and was released on May 21, 2013.

In 2016, a third game, &quot;West of Loathing&quot;, was announced on Steam Greenlight. It was released in August 2017.

In 2019, Johnson was accused of &quot;physical and emotional&quot; abuse by his ex-wife, U.C. Santa Cruz professor A.M. Darke, towards her and &quot;West of Loathing&quot; designer Kevin Simmons. She also alleged that he had removed part of the game to avoid crediting her for its development. Johnson denied the allegations of physical abuse, although admitting to &quot;emotional immaturity and anger and cruelty&quot; in a written apology. He later added Darke to the game&#x27;s credits, claiming she had only provided feedback to the game and did not work on it in a design capacity. An ex-girlfriend of Johnson&#x27;s, Bonnie Mattson, also alleged similar abusive behavior during a 2005 relationship.

In 2022, a fourth game, &quot;Shadows Over Loathing&quot;, was released on Steam.

<text>The University of Lynchburg, formerly Lynchburg College, is a private university associated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and located in Lynchburg, Virginia, United States. It has approximately 2,800 undergraduate and graduate students. The university&#x27;s campus spans 264 acres.

==History==
The University of Lynchburg was founded in 1903 by Josephus Hopwood as Virginia Christian College. Hopwood was president of Milligan College in Tennessee when a group of ministers and businessmen approached him about establishing a college in Lynchburg. He agreed to serve as president, after which the group purchased the failed Westover Hotel resort for $13,500, securing Lynchburg&#x27;s current campus. Hopwood worked with his wife Sarah Eleanor LaRue Hopwood to establish the college based on their shared vision.

The University of Lynchburg was the first institution in the United States to train nuclear physicists and engineers for the NS &quot;Savannah&quot; project under the order of President Eisenhower, to aid in the development and operation of the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered ship.

The institution officially changed its name to Lynchburg College in 1919, citing a constituency that had expanded beyond Virginia.

Beginning with 11 faculty and 55 students, the institution has grown to 159 full-time faculty and 2,800 undergraduate and graduate students. For undergraduate students, the university offers 39 majors, 49 minors, two dual-degree programs, and the Westover Honors Program. It also confers the Master of Arts, Master of Business Administration, Master of Education, and Master of Science in Nursing as well as doctoral degrees in physical therapy, physician assistants, and educational leadership.

The University of Lynchburg hymn was written by alumnus Paul E. Waters. Its melody is derived from J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden&quot;.

In fall 1994, a few months after Intel introduced its Pentium microprocessor, Thomas R. Nicely, from the University of Lynchburg, was performing computations related to the distribution of prime numbers and discovered the Pentium FDIV bug. Nicely left Lynchburg College in 2000.

In July 2018, the university changed its name from Lynchburg College to the University of Lynchburg.

In May 2024, university administrators announced significant cuts to the university&#x27;s academic programs, staff, and faculty. They planned to close 12 undergraduate majors, 25 undergraduate minors, and five graduate programs. They also planned to eliminate 40 staff and 40 faculty positions. University leaders described this as a &quot;strategic transformation&quot; that was necessary in light of declining enrollments and growing debt. From 2017 to 2022, enrollment decreased by nearly 15% to about 2,400 students. In 2023, the university experienced a deficit of $8.6 million.

==Campus==
The University of Lynchburg is located in Lynchburg, Virginia, about 180 miles southwest of Washington D.C., in the Central Virginia foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It occupies in Lynchburg and has a separate environmental research center on , the Claytor Nature Study Center, located about 40 minutes from campus. Most students live on campus and in nearby university-owned houses.

==Student life==

The University of Lynchburg has over 40 clubs and organizations for students to participate in. Examples of organization types are Greek life, student government, spiritual life, volunteer organizations, leadership programs, and publications.

===Greek life===
Fraternity life began on the University of Lynchburg campus in 1962, but disbanded in the mid-1980s. Fraternities and sororities appeared on campus again in 1992. All official Greek houses are located on Vernon Street and are currently owned by the university.

==Athletics==
The University of Lynchburg Hornets participate in NCAA Division III and the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC). The Hornets program offers 24 intercollegiate athletics programs, 23 which compete in Division III, along with equestrian, which competes in both the Intercollegiate Horse Shows Association and National Collegiate Equestrian Association formats. Since joining the ODAC as a charter member in 1976, the Hornets have recorded 205 conference titles.

In recent years, Lynchburg athletics has competed for four team national championships. The women&#x27;s soccer program won Lynchburg&#x27;s first-ever team national championship in 2014, defeating Williams College in penalty kicks to take the crown. In 2010, the Hornets men&#x27;s soccer program reached the Division III national championship match, where they fell in overtime to Messiah College. In 2015, the men&#x27;s lacrosse team made its own run to the national title game, losing to Tufts University in the championship game, 19–11. In the 2023 NCAA DIII baseball tournament final, Lynchburg defeated Johns Hopkins in 3 games to capture its first national championship.

Multiple men&#x27;s cross country, indoor, and outdoor track &amp; field athletes have captured NCAA Division III titles over the years as well. In 2009, Ricky Flynn won the Division III men&#x27;s cross country championship.

<text>The History of the Great War Based on Official Documents by Direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence (abbreviated to History of the Great War or British Official History) is a series of concerning the war effort of the British state during the First World War. It was produced by the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence from 1915 to 1949; after 1919 Brigadier-General Sir James Edmonds was Director. Edmonds wrote many of the army volumes and influenced the choice of historians for the navy, air force, medical and veterinary volumes. Work had begun on the series in 1915 and in 1920, the first volumes of &quot;Naval Operations&quot; and &quot;Seaborne Trade&quot;, were published. The first &quot;army&quot; publication, &quot;Military Operations: France and Belgium 1914&quot; Part I and a separate map case were published in 1922 and the final volume, &quot;The Occupation of Constantinople&quot; was published in 2010.

The &quot;History of the Great War&quot; Military Operations volumes were originally intended as a technical history for military staff. Single-volume popular histories of military operations and naval operations written by civilian writers were to be produced for the general public but Sir John Fortescue was dismissed for slow work on the military volume and his draft was not published. Edmonds preferred to appoint half-pay and retired officers, who were cheaper than civilian writers and wrote that occasionally &quot;the &#x27;War House&#x27; foisted elderly officers on him, because they were not going to be promoted or offered employment but was afraid to tell them so&quot;.

In the 1987 introduction to &quot;Operations in Persia 1914–1919&quot;, G. M. Bayliss wrote that the guides issued by Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO) were incomplete. &quot;Sectional List number 60&quot; of 1976 omitted the &quot;Gallipoli&quot; volumes but contained &quot;The Blockade of the Central Empires&quot; (1937), that had been &quot;Confidential&quot; and retained &quot;For Official Use Only&quot; until 1961. The twelve volume &quot;History of the Ministry of Munitions&quot;, the &quot;Occupation of the Rhineland&quot; (1929) and &quot;Operations in Persia 1914–1919&quot; (1929) were included. The Imperial War Museum Department of Printed Books and the Battery Press republished the official history in the 1990s with black and white maps. The Imperial War Museum Department of Printed Books and the Naval &amp; Military Press republished the set in paperback with colour maps in the 2000s and on DVD-ROM in the 2010s.

==Background==

===Official history===

The modern form of official military history began in the mid-nineteenth century with reports written as guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, were not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that its official histories should be written for the public, since it had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could be expected to have experience of military service and knowledge of the war to inform their writing. The contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also to be suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing explicit lessons from their successes and failures.

None of the points of view to be served by the production of official history is immune to error, because work by a military historian can be fraudulent, distorting the record for personal or political reasons. Populist history can dilute the story to the point of worthlessness and civilian academics can be prone to select facts and interpretations according to their ideals, ideology and preconceived ideas. Military histories written as textbooks might be expected to have a basis in truth, necessary to teach useful lessons to students and the British &quot;Report of the Committee on the Lessons of the Great War&quot; (Kirk Report, 1931) drew on the published volumes of the British official history; conclusions in the report were incorporated into a new edition of &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;. Operations might again be conducted in Iraq and Iran and official history volumes were produced against the objections of the Foreign Office. Military histories concentrated on the doings of national contingents, rarely referring to those of allied and opposing armies; comparative analysis is absent and national bias, due to ulterior motives like the temptation to myth-make, can also be found. The Australian &quot;Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918&quot; edited by Charles Bean contains exaggerations of the significance of the Australian contribution, the prowess of Australian soldiers and disparagements of soldiers from Britain and its allies. Australian failures and casualties are sometimes blamed on British higher commanders, when high-ranking Australian officers could justly be criticised.

After the First World War, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was at risk of abolition and needed to justify its existence with a function that could not be fulfilled by the army or navy. The parts of &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1922–1937) written by H. A. Jones gave undue emphasis to strategic bombing, unbalancing the work. Embarrassing events could be disguised by underwriting and in the French official history , the French Army Mutinies of 1917 were passed over in a few paragraphs, despite occurring in of the French Army. Many of the historians, editors and contributors to the &quot;History of the Great War&quot; (1915–1949) had been senior officers during the war, which had the advantage of bringing first-hand knowledge of events and experience of military art to the work but risked allowing loyalty and an understandable desire to protect reputations leading to unfair blaming, particularly on outsiders.

The narrative of the Battle of Jutland (1916) is described in Volume III of the Royal Navy history &quot;Naval Operations&quot; (1923). The draft text was revised at the request of some serving officers present at the battle to remove critical remarks about them. Many of these officers were retired or dead when a revised edition was published in 1940 but the excised passages were not restored. The British Army &quot;Military Operations...&quot; volumes have been criticised for dishonesty, in not blaming GHQ for the extent of British casualties. The authors have been accused of exculpating Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from December 1915 to the end of the war, by default. In 2011, Neil Wells wrote that as the history is a description of events, rather than an analytical work with criticism and conclusions, Haig and other commanders escape explicit blame for failures, yet the reader is left free to form conclusions.

===British official history===

In 1906, official histories were being written by three departments at the War Office and one in the Admiralty. Lord Esher, a member of the Committee of Imperial Defence, suggested that a subcommittee be established as the Historical Section, to centralise the collection of army and navy archives, as a repository of the lessons of war for strategists. Esher thought that the lessons of the South African War (11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902) could not be shown unless the naval, military and political aspects of the war were treated as one. In January 1907, the subcommittee was established with Sir George Clarke as chairman, charged with the completion of an official history of the Boer War. The original account was begun by Colonel George Henderson (1854–1903), before ill health forced him to retire. Before he died, Henderson had completed a narrative up to the beginning of the war but it was not published. A later version, (&quot;History of the war in South Africa&quot; 1899–1902, four volumes, 1906–1910) by Major-General Frederick Maurice reached publication but had needed a large number of assistants which increased the price of the book; it was favourably received but did not sell well.

===Histories of the Great War===
In August 1914, the Historical Section was busy on a history of the Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904 – 5 September 1905) and work was suspended on the outbreak of the First World War. The section began to collect material being returned from France and Lieutenant-Colonel E. Y. Daniel was appointed as full-time Secretary. Experience of writing the history of the South African war showed that delay made the task impossible and that the collection of material for the work should begin at once. In May 1915, Captain Christopher Atkinson was sent to France to collect unit diaries. Atkinson reported that the diaries were inadequate, because of the difficulty of writing them during events like the Great Retreat of 1914, when few were kept and those that were had big gaps. Although the diaries would not show &quot;why&quot; events occurred, Atkinson recommended that they should be indexed and grouped by unit, subject and chronology for later scrutiny to identify discrepancies caused by the organisation of the material.

A formal decision to write an official history was taken in a Cabinet meeting on 26 August 1915, when Maurice Hankey (1 April 1877 – 26 January 1963) the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of the War Council, advocated a series of histories to provide

Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener (24 June 1850 – 5 June 1916) the Secretary of State for War wanted work begun on a single-volume popular history, to be published soon after the war. This would maintain public interest in the main series and put the case of the government at the same time as accounts by participants and popular authors. The Treasury objected over the cost but Hankey considered that it would be a work of education and reference, not a commercial proposition and that if scientific works were judged only on commercial criteria, research would be abolished.

The Treasury gave way and agreed to finance an official history series and popular single-volume works, written by civilian authors, to ensure public appeal. Sir Julian Corbett (12 November 1854 – 21 September 1922) was appointed to write the navy volume and Sir John Fortescue (28 December 1859 – 22 October 1933) was chosen for the army volume. Work on the military histories was slow and in 1917, Daniel reported that Atkinson and an assistant had examined only diaries and that the Fortescue narrative had only reached as far as November 1914. The war precluded a big increase in manpower and for the Fortescue volume to be adequate, Daniel reported that confidential staff correspondence would be needed. With the huge increase in the size of the British army, it would only be practical to use some unit diaries and care would be needed to avoid skewing their selection. In March 1919, Winston Churchill (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) received a draft copy of the Corbett popular history of the navy and objected to certain passages. Churchill wanted official records to be published with the volume so that readers could judge for themselves. Hankey claimed that Churchill&#x27;s objections made the publication of an official history series questionable, since they would inevitably reflect on leaders, many of whom were still in public life.
Hankey wrote that an official history should &quot;not&quot; be written, because it would attract parliamentary and public criticism, the length of time taken to publish would mean that each volume would be examined and that the history would be produced at a loss. The experience of producing the navy volume also showed that each publication would

but the objections were not enough to cancel the project, given the benefits of publication. The public knew little of the early stages of the war and it had a right to benefit from the state monopoly on official information, presented in a readable manner. An official history would also serve to educate professional officers, considerations that mattered more than cost and that criticism was unavoidable. Publication would rebut unofficial histories that blamed the government or individual officers and for this, the histories could not evade controversy or be inoffensive to individual sensibilities. The Cabinet agreed for publication to continue, subject to vetting by the War Office and the Cabinet, with the proviso that the decision might be reversed if the Corbett volume was badly received; the volume was published in 1920 to extremely good press reviews. Work on the military histories in 1919 was hampered by paucity of resources and bad management, until Brigadier-General James Edmonds (25 December 1861 – 2 August 1956), who had joined the Historical Section in February 1919, was appointed Director on 1 April. Edmonds found documents in un-catalogued bundles on the floor, from which historians had abstracted items and not replaced them.

The Fortescue volume was to have covered the war but he wrote so slowly that it was decided to end his volume at May 1915 and only cover France. Edmonds also came to doubt the quality of the work, judging Fortescue to be ignorant of the workings of a contemporary army, apparently being behind the times; Fortescue had excluded dates and times and used obsolete language; he agreed to revise his draft but then took no notice, his second draft being confused, containing nothing about the general situation and hardly referring to the Germans. Senior officers were ridiculed, the government blamed for not stopping the war and the French effort was &quot;slurred over in less than one typewritten page&quot;. Edmonds blamed Fortescue for lack of interest, lethargy and ignoring the records made available, bungling the chance to write an exciting story of the BEF by delivering a patchwork of unit diaries. At the end of the year, Edmonds decided to rewrite the work because of Fortescue&#x27;s prevarication and &quot;grossly inaccurate and misleading&quot; writing; Fortescue was sacked and Edmonds even wanted him to be made to pay back his salary. After the unfortunate experience with Fortescue, Edmonds decided that an account must be enhanced by statements, private records of officers and by German material, to counter &quot;garbled&quot; accounts by the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle and John Buchan. Soundings with publishers and authors convinced Edmonds that a work based on dispatches would fail to engage the public. An educational work needed a foundation on which to base teaching, conclusions which were similar to those of Hankey; a work must be readable enough for the public to buy, be a credible educational work for the military student and rebut inaccurate commercial accounts by civilian authors.

==Prelude==

===Finance===
The cost of producing the official history was raised in the House of Commons on 13 June 1922, during a proposal to farm out the work to private enterprise. Some MPs claimed to have heard nothing of the &quot;History... &quot; in spite of five volumes having been published to a very good press. Daniel was called before H. A. L. Fisher, the President of the Board of Education and pointed out that working on the &quot;History...&quot; would never pay a living wage and that for educational reasons the government must foot the bill, because of the exceptional value of the work. He calculated that the cost of the &quot;&quot;History...&quot; from 1916 to 1922 was about £42,000, the military histories costing £16,800 and the naval works £11,800, while the annual cost of producing Hansard was £44,000&quot;. Daniel also showed that the cost of the war from 3 August 1914 to 31 March 1920 was £11,196,927,000 or £3,500 per minute, a vast cost, against which the price of making the experience available for education was about four minutes of war expenditure per year for the Historical Section. The next meeting of the Historical Section subcommittee on 31 July 1922 endorsed the continuation of the project.

Finance remained the dominant influence on the production of the volumes, rather than literary or academic concerns about the work of the Historical Section. The subcommittee met six times in 1923 and on 9 August, Hankey managed to obtain a permanent Cabinet Subcommittee of Control of the Official Histories, chaired by the President of the Board of Education and meeting annually. There were twelve meetings between 1924 and 1946, with representatives from the Treasury, War Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry and the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Daniel and Edmonds usually attended; other official historians and members of the Colonial and India offices were present for particular discussions; where the committee failed to agree, a ruling was made by the Cabinet. Edmonds submitted an annual report, other historians added summaries of their work, progress reports, staff and personnel matters and publications by foreign official historians. Meetings considered costs and the progress of publication, the number of volumes, their scope and size. On rare occasions the committee made a ruling on content, after complaints by a department; in 1928, the War Office strenuously objected to some of the content of the first Gallipoli volume by Cecil Aspinall-Oglander.

Money determined the speed of publication, the size and number of volumes and the choice of author, Edmonds preferring to employ officers on half-pay or retired on £500 per year, about half the price of a civilian author; officers were usually willing to work longer hours and do unpaid work. The Treasury managed to obtain the removal of Lieutenant-General Launcelot Kiggell, former Chief of the General Staff of the British Armies in France (late 1915 to early 1918) from 1918 Part I for reasons of cost. In 1923, it had been decided to prepare the volume out of sequence because of the importance of the failure of the German spring offensive (21 March – 18 July 1918) but by 1926, Kiggell had failed to prepare even a draft narrative for circulation to participants and thought that it would take him another four years to complete the work. At the Committee for Control meeting in January 1926, the Treasury recommended Kiggell&#x27;s dismissal and Edmonds agreed, because his work was &quot;lacking in colour and atmosphere&quot;.

===Commerce===
The price of the early volumes was set at 21 Shillings (21s) and another 21s for accompanying map cases but this was considered too costly for professional officers. In 1923, the price was cut to 12s 6d but this left no surplus for advertising and no incentive for booksellers to display them prominently; publishers also set a maximum number of pages per volume, a constraint that led the Committee for Control in 1924 to advise a price increase to 15s. In March 1933, Edmonds showed copies of French, German and Austrian histories to demonstrate their &quot;elaborate and voluminous&quot; nature. The comprehensive nature of the project was also determined by finance and proposals made by government departments from 1922 to 1939, for histories beyond the Western Front. In 1931, the War Office asked for a volume on the East African Campaign, because of lessons offered by a campaign in such a climate, at such a distance from Britain. The Treasury refused and suggested that the Colonial Office pay, as it had done for the West African volume. East Africa Part I was eventually published in 1941 with Colonial Office money. At the same meeting, the Foreign Office asked for a volume on the Blockade of Germany at their expense, because of the lessons that could be learned and its utility in conferences on international law; by being labelled &quot;Confidential&quot; it could be written frankly. Several volumes were financed by interested departments but Edmonds retained supervision and maintained the same editorial control as for the other volumes.

Parsimony affected the organisation of the Historical Section and the speed it could publish the &quot;History... &quot; Premises, visits to battlefields and the number of historians and administrators were limited and in 1922, Edmonds threatened to resign if denied more help. Along with Daniel and Edmonds, the section had only three or four full-time officers, who had to write the volumes, prepare them for publication, maintain the library, study prisoner of war (POW) records and foreign official and non-official publications (in their native language) and provide help for the War Office, War Graves Commission, Staff College, educational establishments and government departments. The section had about a year to its cramped offices in Cavendish Square, until it moved to the Audit Office in 1922. By 1924, Edmonds had five administrators and eight writers, when the French and German equivalents had about the British staff were also underpaid, Archibald Becke being refused a salary increase from £500 per annum. Edmonds got the money instead, from £560 to £800 per annum and then £1,000 per annum in 1924, when he was writing most of the histories, managing the section and working a seven-day-week for three months, then taking ten days off (Edmonds worked like this for much of the of the project). A 1927 proposal for Cyril Falls (2 March 1888 – 23 April 1971) to visit Mesopotamia for £200 was vetoed by the Treasury but £50 was allowed for Aspinall-Oglander to visit Gallipoli.

===Official documents===

The British Expeditionary Forces were the largest army the British state had raised and by 1924 it had generated more than documents; Edmonds thought they would take nine years to sort. When he took up his duties, Edmonds found the papers in heaps in the floor and apparently summarily sacked the Chief Clerk, for refusing to climb a ladder to retrieve a bundle. Edmonds complained that his predecessor, Christopher Atkinson, had let historians plunder the packets of documents and not return items, it had taken until June 1923 to catalogue the records. The first draft of a volume was prepared by a &quot;narrator&quot;, who sorted, read and analysed the documents. The result was revised by the &quot;historian&quot; who added comments and a conclusion. The draft was then sent to participants down to battalion commanders, other senior military officers, politicians and government departments. The draft for 1916 Part I (including the First Day on the Somme) was sent to who, by 1931, had sent Comments on the first chapter created a pile high and Edmonds complained that his staff was insufficient, considering that he had briefed them that all names, initials, ranks and numbers had to be checked and then cross-checked with the French and German accounts; the small number of staff slowed production. In 1922, Edmonds had calculated that it would take twenty years to write ten volumes, a feat that the French had achieved in three years. It took (excluding 1939–1945) to produce Front volumes and on other theatres.

===Content===
While finance determined the speed of the writing of volumes, Edmonds, as the Director, had the greater influence on the literary and academic integrity of the work. In the first volume, published in 1922, Edmonds wrote in the preface, that &quot;no deviation from the truth nor misrepresentation will be found in the official histories on which my name appeared&quot;. Edmonds&#x27; claim has been challenged ever since, leading to a common assumption that the work is vapid at best and at worst fraudulent, a partial, misleading and exculpatory account of the military establishment. In 1934, Liddell Hart questioned the integrity of the writers, calling 1918 Part I &quot;patriotic&quot; and &quot;parochial&quot;. Norman Brook, one of the official historians, claimed in 1945, that Edmonds could not be trusted to revise 1916 Part I, because he had succumbed to the temptation to interpolate his views. In 1976, John Keegan (15 May 1934 – 2 August 2012) wrote

In 1985, David French wrote that Edmonds &quot;...has a private purpose to conceal the truth about the high command in France from the lay public...&quot; and that Edmonds had become concerned to rebut claims by politicians that Haig wasted lives on futile offensives; Edmonds&#x27; subjects were heroes and beyond criticism. Tim Travers wrote that Edmonds eschewed direct criticism of senior officers, was obliged to Haig and protected his reputation, rigged facts and drew false conclusions in the volumes on the Somme (1916 Part I), Passchendaele (1917 Part II) and 1918 Part I. In 1996, Paddy Griffith (4 February 1947 – 25 June 2010) called it an &quot;...encyclopaedic work, transparently individualistic in tone, lucidly organised, wide in scope and by far the best book on the Western Front.&quot;. Griffith called the quantity of writing on the Great War &quot;prodigious&quot; and that despite Edmonds being unstable, insecure and having never held a field appointment, he was conscientious, intelligent and rarely allowed his devious and opinionated nature to distort his work on the official history.

Edmonds determined the presentation of information, which imposed constraints on the authors. All but implied criticism was to be avoided and the author was to resist the temptation to be &quot;wise after the event&quot;. Disclosure of facts about opponents was to be kept to small-type footnotes or in notes at the end of chapters, because introducing facts not known at the time was hindsight, which was unfair and un-scholarly. A conclusion could be written for reflection and comment but not for fault-finding. For Edmonds, the constraints were necessary for some facts innocuously to be shown to the lay reader, yet be significant to experts reading between the lines. After Henry FitzMaurice Stacke, the first author of &quot;Military Operations: East Africa, Volume I&quot; died and Charles Hordern was appointed as replacement, Hordern wrote that Stacke had been frustrated by being obliged to

The avoidance of hindsight was consistent with the education Edmonds received at the Staff College on the teaching of Carl von Clausewitz (1 June 1780 – 16 November 1831), that the critic must only use the information available to a commander and his motives, rather than what the commander did not and could not know. Using knowledge after the event could show arrogance and a lack of critical judgement. In writing the first Gallipoli volume (1929), Cecil Aspinall-Oglander ignored the convention and on the draft copy, Edmonds called his account biased and lacking in the objective judgement necessary for an official historian. When Aspinall-Oglander refused to revise his text, Edmonds criticised him for

a complaint which had been occasionally levelled at Edmonds by the War Office and several participants in the war. Despite the constraints that Edmonds imposed on the form of the official histories, Andrew Green called his accounts accurate and comprehensive. Edmonds&#x27;s correspondence with Basil Liddell Hart shows that Hart valued the official history and offered constructive criticism. Green wrote that when David French called the work &quot;official but not history&quot;, he had used Hart&#x27;s words out of context, Liddell Hart meaning that by leaving potentially controversial details to be read between the lines, Edmonds created the risk that later historians might use the phrase &quot;official but not history&quot;, to describe the volumes.

==Publishing==

===&quot;Persia&quot;, 1914–1919===

In October 1920, the Government of India provided money for a record of the Indian contribution to the world war and chose Brigadier-General F. J. Moberly (15 September 1867 – 6 April 1952) to write the official account of the Mesopotamian Campaign (6 November 1914 – 14 November 1918). Moberly published four volumes from 1923 to 1927 and in 1926 the Government of India requested an additional volume on the Persian Campaign (December 1914 – 30 October 1918). The work was nearly finished by September 1927, when the Government of India had doubts about publication on political grounds, because it would be dangerous to disclose intrigues with Iranian governments and individuals. The most helpful Iranian factions would come badly out of a volume that denigrated their assistance and &quot;...the less we bring Afghanistan into the narrative the better for us&quot;. Sir Denys Bray of the Foreign and Political Department (Army Headquarters, India) supported the &quot;excellent written&quot; history but wanted it lodged in the &quot;Confidential&quot; records. Stephen Gaslee of the Foreign Office wrote to Daniel in October 1927, about his concern that the government of the Soviet Union (USSR) might publish information from the Russian Empire on Iran.

Gaslee felt that Soviet disclosures might put the British government at a disadvantage, if a censored version of British involvement in Iran had already been published; instead he preferred a comprehensive history kept &quot;Confidential&quot;. General George Kirkpatrick (Chief of the General Staff [India] from 1916 to 1920), took the view that discussion of the Seistan Strategy might upset Iranian sensibilities. Sir Percy Cox (20 November 1864 – 20 February 1937) who had been Chief Political Officer of Indian Expeditionary Force D, told Moberly that it was a fine piece of work, free from bias. Moberly wrote to Cox that avoiding controversy would render the volume valueless, making it impossible to justify British involvement in Iran to the public. Moberly referred to sensitivity over the &quot;corrupt and self-interested attitude&quot; of most Iranian politicians during the war and British fears of unrest in Afghanistan. Cox agreed that a bowdlerised account would be worthless and that Moberly should write without fear or favour, if necessary securing a commercial publisher. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 9 March 1928, the volume was limited &quot;For Official Use Only&quot; and since this would increase the cost of the volume, His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO) agreed to pay for it.

Moberly finished the work in May 1928, then in September, after the Foreign Office and the Government of India had approved the text, Lord Peel, Secretary of State for India, insisted that the politics of the military operations be removed and the last three chapters re-written, because even in a volume restricted &quot;For Official Use Only&quot;, the disclosure of secrets was most objectionable. Moberly wrote that if officers were to benefit from the experience of wartime events in Iran, the exceptional nature of political factors there and in neighbouring countries could not be ignored. Moberly wrote that he understood the need for care in writing the history and that the chapters had been vetted informally by the Foreign Office and approved by Cox, who as an expert in the field, was well qualified to balance secrecy with the needs of army students. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 26 March 1929, it was ruled that the volume would be marked &quot;Confidential&quot; in Britain and &quot;Secret&quot; in India. Edmonds had objected to the &quot;Confidential&quot; label, since it would be withheld from young officers but was over-ruled. A limited edition of copies was printed by HMSO in late 1929, with marked &quot;Secret&quot; and sent to the Government of India. In March 1930, copies of the &quot;Confidential&quot; volume were supplied to the Imperial War Museum (IWM) library among others and in February 1933, HMSO destroyed the last copies; in 1987 the IWM published a facsimile copy of the volume at £24 net.

===&quot;Rhineland&quot;, 1918–1929===
In 1930, Edmonds proposed a volume on the occupation in the Rhine Province by British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), to counter a recent German book but the Treasury refused to pay. Edmonds hoped that the War Office would find the money, began to collect information from former commanders and staffs of the BAOR and ensured the storage of BAOR records. By 1939, poor offices, lack of promotions and government parsimony, led him to complain that the official history, a national memorial, was being neglected. When Daniel retired in late 1939, Edmonds took on the duties of Secretary as well as Director and on 15 November, the Historical Section was evacuated to St. Anne&#x27;s on Sea, Lancashire and thence to the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth in April 1942. In February, the Committee for the Control of Official Histories decided to let Edmonds write the volume. R. A. Butler, President of the Board of Education, said that the volume would be useful as a historical background for the Armistice and disarmament terms to be imposed on Germany. In 1987, Bayliss wrote that utility was the main criterion but that it also kept Edmonds busy, having been passed over for the writing of the official histories of the Second World War. Edmonds was pleased because he saw it as the final volume of his Western Front campaign history.

Edmonds felt qualified to write the volume, having visited the Rhineland during the occupation, having gained specialist knowledge of the law of military government working with Professor L. F. L. Oppenheim (30 March 1858 – 7 October 1919) in 1912 on &quot;The Laws and Usages of War&quot; and being on good terms with many of the senior officers involved. Edmonds was hampered by a 1942 air raid, that burnt many of the records stored at Walworth in London. At Aberystwyth, Edmonds was isolated from metropolitan libraries and short of researchers. Requests for help from the Director of the Imperial War Museum had little effect, since his books had been moved to Barnstaple in Devon and because coverage of the occupation and inter-war period was sparse, owing to the usual lack of money. Edmonds was still able to glean plenty of details and gossip from senior officers in the occupation. General Charles Fergusson (17 January 1865 – 20 February 1951), a former military governor of Cologne, said that he disliked Field Marshal William Robertson (29 January 1860 – 12 February 1933) and that the enmity had led him to resign, despite being on good terms with General Herbert Plumer (13 March 1857 – 16 July 1932).

Major-General Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd, Chief of Staff of the BAOR, criticised Robertson for being too fussy, Fergusson for pro-German sympathies and told Plumer that Fergusson was too much of a gentleman for the job. Plumer had asked if it were possible to be too much of a gentleman and Massingberd reminisced that he had said

Due to the hostilities, Edmonds was unable to correspond and exchange material with German researchers and was allowed only a galley proof and one page proof. In October 1943, Edmonds complained that speed and economy mattered more than respect for military history. Edmonds hoped that the volume would have educational use, in the event that Britain would again occupy foreign lands and that

Edmonds struggled to produce an impartial history of the occupation and draft copies sent to the War Office and Foreign Office, led Brigadier W. L. van Cutsen for the War Office to complain that the volume should have been more broadly written and that administrative and other details were overly detailed but he found the chapter on the operations of the British Upper Silesia Force helpful. Far worse criticism came from the Foreign Office on 3 January 1944, the text being called often misleading and incomplete, without the inclusion of much controversial material. It was suggested that the value of the volume would be enhanced by the reduction of political references to mere facts and dates. Examples included a desire to describe the murder of Kurt von Schleicher (7 April 1882 – 30 June 1934) &quot;in the purge of 30 June 1934&quot; rather than &quot;by Hitler&quot; in Edmonds&#x27; draft. Unemployment pay should never be referred to as a &quot;dole&quot; as this implied that British men had enlisted in the pre-1914 army to avoid starvation and Lloyd George (17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945) might resent being portrayed as &quot;less well-disposed&quot; to Germany, than Bonar Law (16 September 1858 – 30 October 1923). More examples were quoted and ended on Edmonds&#x27; description of the Locarno Treaties (5–16 October 1925) with &quot;...it is most improper for an official historian to describe a treaty concluded by His Majesty&#x27;s Government as &#x27;verbiage&#x27;&quot;.

Edmonds retorted that he would ignore the criticisms as they were &quot;trifling or silly&quot;, except for a request to cut a comment that Viscount D&#x27;Abernon, Ambassador to Germany (1920–1925) was pro-German. Edmonds pointed out that the views were his, not officially endorsed and that the official history should not be determined by the War Office, Admiralty or Foreign Office. The volume had been based on official documents and he stood by it. The source of the criticism was Charles Webster (25 July 1886 – August 1961), who had written memoranda analysing the Armistice and military occupation, ready for the anticipated re-occupation of Germany. Edmonds was most critical of one of the documents and wrote to Webster defending Haig. Obstacles were placed between him and his detractors, with the intention of protecting his feelings, because the Foreign Office harboured another critic, Llewellyn Woodward (1890–1971), who called the book episodic, with slurred chronology and a narrative of the controversy over provisioning the occupied territories, that was misleading; criticism of civilian authorities lacked evidence and was &quot;dogmatic and prejudiced&quot;. Woodward, less critical than Webster, asked him to spare Edmonds&#x27; feelings but Webster found the book lacking in analytical rigour, refused to devote more time to it and R. A. Butler, Chairman of the Committee on the Control of Official Histories, got the job of rejecting the book for publication. In July 1944, over Edmonds&#x27; objections, it was decided to print a hundred copies &quot;For Official Use Only&quot; but only after many Foreign Office demands had been conceded, including cuts to the preface.

Work on the volume had begun in 1930, resumed in September 1942 and was completed in draft in July 1943. Ready to print in May 1944, the order came on 31 July for a limited edition by HMSO, because the small print run made it impossible for Macmillan to realise a profit. Edmonds later tried to have the small issue made public but in November 1947, HMSO was ordered to destroy the type of the book. (The volume remained unseen, until the Fifty-year Rule was amended to the Thirty-year rule in 1967, that allowed the public to view the surviving copies.) The failings of the volume raised questions as to the suitability of Edmonds continuing as Director of the Historical Section for the rest of the series but given that it was beyond his normal area of expertise, he was allowed to carry on and produced a short account of the Occupation of Constantinople, saw the remaining volumes on the Western Front through to publication and retired in July 1949, just before the publication of the final volume &quot;Military Operations: Italy, 1915–1919&quot; (1949), ended thirty years&#x27; work. Edmonds was somewhat chagrined when the War Office ordered 800 copies of &quot;Assize of Arms&quot; (1946) by Brigadier-General J. H. Morgan (20 March 1876 – 8 April 1955), that he called far more outspoken on the occupation.

===France and Belgium 1917 Part II===

====James Edmonds====
In the second volume of &quot;Military Operations France and Belgium, 1917&quot; (1917 Part II) Edmonds, wrote that Haig and General Hubert Gough (12 August 1870 – 18 March 1963) the Fifth Army commander (30 October 1916 – 27 March 1918), were at cross purposes before and during the early part of the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917). Edmonds described meetings between Gough and his corps commanders on at which deeper objectives than those of the &quot;GHQ 1917 plan&quot; were decided on and that an extra objective was added, to be attempted at the discretion of divisional commanders and only against weak opposition. This fourth objective (red line) was beyond the range of most of the Fifth Army field artillery and all heavy artillery was to be on call to put a defensive barrage beyond advanced posts along it.

Brigadier-General John Davidson, head of the Operations Branch at General Headquarters, questioned the Fifth Army plan in a memorandum of 26 June, recommending that the objectives be less ambitious and that the provision for an advance of to the red line be abandoned. A Fifth Army order of 27 June summarised the conclusions of a meeting by Gough and the corps commanders the previous day and laid down the green line as the main objective, an advance of in the south, in the centre and in the north, at the junction with the French First Army (General François Anthoine). Patrols were to be sent forward to probe the German defences and occupy vacant ground but it was more important to avoid a ragged front line. In reply to Davidson, Gough wrote that the green line should be attempted and that opportunities to take ground up to the red line &quot;without much opposition&quot;, should be taken.

On 28 June, Haig discussed the Davidson memo at a meeting with Gough and General Herbert Plumer, the commander of the Second Army on the right flank of the Fifth Army and emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds wrote that the Fifth Army plan did not conform to Haig&#x27;s requirement that the main battle would be fought for the plateau. Gough had spread the Fifth Army divisions evenly along the front, when he could have increased the size of II Corps (Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob), opposite the plateau. In a footnote, Edmonds described Fifth Army intelligence summaries in July, that stressed the strength of the German defences on the plateau, that the Germans were building more defences there than on the rest of the front and that the assembly areas of the German (specialist counter-attack divisions) were behind the plateau and the Broodseinde–Passchendaele ridge. The summaries predicted that the Germans would try to hold the plateau, even if driven back across the Steenbeek further north.

The description of the apparent misunderstanding between Haig and Gough is contradicted by an account on the following pages of a visit made on 27 June by Haig to the headquarters of II Corps. Jacob asked that his southern flank be extended to allow an attack on the Bassevillebeek Spur beyond the Bassevillebeek Stream, to deny the German army a jumping-off place for counter-attacks against the right flank of the corps from Tower Hamlets, a cluster of pill-boxes at the top of the spur. Haig emphasised to Jacob the importance of the capture of the plateau and arranged with the Fifth Army headquarters &quot;at once&quot;, for II Corps to take command of the 24th Division (Major-General Major-General Louis Bols) to the south, the northernmost division of the Second Army. The Fifth Army–Second Army boundary was moved south on 4 July, to the Klein Zillebeke–Zandvoorde road. In a footnote Edmonds described the transfer of the artillery of the 23rd Division (Major-General James Babington), the 24th Division artillery, thirteen medium (60-pounder gun), 25 heavy (fifteen 6-inch gun, five 8-inch and five 9.2-inch howitzer) batteries from the Second Army to II Corps.

Edmonds wrote that the Fifth Army had and medium guns, and medium howitzers, 1,098 field guns and 324 field howitzers, a total of 2,174 artillery pieces or 2,299 pieces &quot;on the Fifth Army front&quot;. In footnotes, Edmonds added that II Corps had an &quot;extra division&quot;, three heavy counter-battery and three heavy bombardment double groups; (a single group had heavy or medium batteries) while each of the three British corps to the north had two heavy counter-battery double groups and three heavy bombardment groups. The II Corps divisions had eight or nine field artillery brigades each, rather than the six in the divisions of the other corps. II Corps had of the Fifth Army artillery and had five divisions, attacking on 31 July, compared to four divisions with two attacking, in each of the other corps. The green line for II Corps varied, from a depth of on the southern flank at Klein Zillibeke, to on the northern flank, along the Ypres–Roulers railway; the green line from the southern flank of XIX Corps to the northern flank of XIV Corps required an advance of . An advance of to the red line was not fundamental to the plan and discretion to attempt it was left with the divisional commanders, based on the extent of local German resistance, a provision which conformed to the manual SS 135. Had the German defence collapsed and the red line been reached, the German I, II and III lines would still have been east of the new front line, except for of south of Broodseinde.

====Tim Travers====
In &quot;The Killing Ground...&quot; (1987), Tim Travers wrote that on the planning and conduct of the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July – 2 August) and the Battle of Langemarck described in 1917 Part II, the volume reflected three controversies. Travers wrote that Gough believed that Haig had ordered him to plan a breakthrough offensive, particularly at the meeting on 28 June, yet a few days later, Haig changed his mind and wanted a step-by-step attack. Travers wrote that it was illogical to give the principal command of a bite and hold attack to a &quot;thruster&quot; like Gough, when Plumer had a reputation for thoroughness. Travers wrote that Haig wavered in his thinking about what he wanted but left Gough under the impression that he was to plan a breakthrough attack.

Travers wrote that Haig had emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, particularly at the meeting of 28 June and that on 30 June, Haig wrote, &quot;Capture the Passchendaele–Staden Ridge&quot;, on his copy of the Fifth Army plan. The importance of the Gheluvelt plateau is also found in GHQ orders of 5 July and Fifth Army orders on 8 July. Travers wrote that the Fifth Army failed to give adequate emphasis to this and that a structural obstacle constrained the army, since the southern edge of the Gheluvelt plateau was inside the Second Army boundary. Travers concluded that Haig and GHQ chose the time, place and strategy of the campaign and that Gough and the Fifth Army staff decided the tactics. Travers called Wynne&#x27;s first draft of 1917 Part II (1943) as &quot;anti-Haig&quot;, the second draft (1944) as &quot;anti-Gough&quot; and the third draft (1945) as &quot;anti-Haig and anti-Gough&quot;. Edmonds&#x27;s fourth draft (published 1948) was &quot;pro-Haig and anti-Gough&quot; and Wynne declined to be named as an author. Travers wrote that Edmonds was willing to accept criticism and made amendments for interested parties, to whom drafts were circulated but became increasingly protective of Haig&#x27;s reputation and noticeably autocratic towards the other historians.

Travers described a leadership vacuum in the BEF caused by delegation, that was &quot;scandalous&quot; and that Edmonds failed to stress this. Gough had attempted a breakthrough offensive, conforming to the decisions laid down by Haig, was at fault for overlooking the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau and for ignoring a suggestion by the XIV Corps commander (Lieutenant-General Rudolph Cavan), to add weight to the attack there. Travers wrote that 1917 Part II omitted a request made by Gough in August for a conference, to discuss a remedy for the lack of weight being brought against the Gheluvelt plateau, a matter that Haig and the staff at GHQ should have settled long before the attack commenced, along with the awkward placement of the Second Army-Fifth Army boundary. In the published version of 1917 Part II, most of the blame for the decisions on the type of offensive, the width and direction of attacks and responsibility for planning was put on Gough and the Fifth Army staff, rather than on Haig and GHQ for selecting the Ypres Salient at all.

====Andrew Green====
In 2003, Green described the writing of 1917 Part II by Wynne and the circulation of the first draft to participants. Gough found the first draft highly objectionable and since so many other participants in the battle had died, his views were given considerable attention by Edmonds, during Wynne&#x27;s absence on war work in 1943. Gough held that the draft exaggerated his intention to break through the German defences at Ypres. Gough described the meeting of 28 June 1917 by Haig, Gough and Plumer, as evidence of Haig&#x27;s understanding and acceptance of the Fifth Army plan. Gough noted that General Headquarters had caused a road to be built and kept clear for the use of cavalry and that Haig had rejected Rawlinson&#x27;s and Plumer&#x27;s plans as too limited. Gough stressed that his plan was not limited by specific objectives, which had hampered attacks at Loos and Gallipoli in 1915 and the Somme in 1916. Wynne had referred to the Davidson memo of 26 June but Gough pointed out that reserves were available close by, to exploit advantages that emerged, rather than the first attacking troops were to advance indefinitely.

Green wrote that Edmonds told Wynne to include the points made by Gough but that Wynne objected, because Davidson had related how Haig revised his views after a 25 June meeting with the Cabinet in London and wrote &quot;wear down the enemy but have an objective&quot; on the Fifth Army plan. Wynne claimed that Gough had misunderstood Haig&#x27;s intentions and that was the source of Gough&#x27;s objections to the draft; Edmonds supported Wynne but later changed his mind. Green wrote that Haig had intended Gough to conduct a breakthrough attempt and that Edmonds had included this in the draft, as well as describing the changes in Haig&#x27;s outlook during 1917, as the prospect of significant French support varied. Gough had added the red line to meet Haig&#x27;s requirements but overlooked the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, spreading his forces equally across the attack front. Green noted that Prior and Wilson had found this in their 1998 study and that in 2001 Simpson noted Prior and Wilson&#x27;s emphasis on artillery and lack of analysis of infantry operations. Green also wrote that Edmonds referred to the continuity of Haig&#x27;s optimism about the possibility of a deep advance on 4 August, 21 September and in early October, long after the likelihood had ended.

Edmonds changed the draft in Gough&#x27;s favour, by showing that the weather in August was unusually wet, with extracts from a French study &quot;Le Climat de La France&quot; (Guillaume Bigourdan) that contradicted the 1929 book by Haig&#x27;s Chief Intelligence Officer Brigadier-General John Charteris (1915–1918). Edmonds wrote that the worst of the weather occurred from 12 October to 10 November, yet vividly described the wet and muddy conditions in August and their morale-sapping effect on British troops. Wynne had written extensively on the difficulties of the French Army after the Nivelle Offensive and its effect on British strategy but Edmonds cut much of this. Edmonds left much of the remainder of Wynne&#x27;s draft, despite Gough&#x27;s objection that it implied that Haig had abrogated his authority by delegating so much to Gough and not imposing changes, to allay his doubts about the Fifth Army plan for the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds noted the persistence with which Haig pursued objectives and that he advocated attacks regardless of their geographical progress, to keep pressure on the German army.

Green related an estrangement between Wynne and Edmonds, over Edmonds&#x27; willingness to accept Gough&#x27;s objections. Edmonds sent Wynne to meet Gough, which led to a substantial change in Wynne&#x27;s point of view. Wynne revised the draft to remove much of the blame from Gough, writing that Haig bore principal responsibility for the Fifth Army plan in the third (1945) draft. Edmonds then found this draft objectionable and quarrelled with Wynne, who declined to be named as an author. Green wrote that Edmonds and Wynne had changed their views about Gough and made the narrative of his role in the events of 1917 much more accurate, it being noticeably less defensive of Haig. Wynne&#x27;s conclusion had been that the strategy of retaining the initiative to protect the French Army had worked and that the tactical intention to clear the Belgian coast had failed, due to an underestimation of German resilience and the mistaken attempt at a breakthrough.

Earlier plans had been for short advances and an emphasis on the Gheluvelt plateau. Haig was responsible for accepting Gough&#x27;s plan for 31 July, despite his cautious reminder to Gough on 6 July, giving the Passchendaele–Staden Ridge and the Belgian coast as geographical objectives. Wynne removed these details from his draft but concluded that the &quot;GHQ 1917 plan&quot; might have been as successful as the Battle of Messines (7–14 June). Edmonds had also accepted the logic of an offensive in Flanders but not that of appointing Gough; if Haig had wanted a cautious attack he was wrong to have relegated Plumer. Green showed that Edmonds acknowledged the constraints affecting Haig but that he had wanted a breakthrough attack, chose Gough who known as a &quot;thruster&quot; and encouraged his optimism; Haig had kept any misgivings to himself.

Green referred to Tim Travers and wrote that he had taken the same view as Edmonds, on the questions of the intended breakthrough and the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds had written that Haig had accepted Gough&#x27;s wishes and Green wrote that this did not mean that Gough was aware of Haig&#x27;s doubts. Edmonds thought that Haig wanted a decisive success and the capture of distant objectives on the first day, &quot;despite&quot; doubts that he kept to himself. Travers had written that the Edmonds draft was wrong, yet had formed the same conclusions as Edmonds. Travers had criticised the published draft for failing to record that Haig had not resolved disagreements and problems among his subordinates, long before the offensive began; Green wrote that Edmonds had made the same criticism. Green wrote that judging the drafts of the volume &quot;pro-&quot; or &quot;anti-&quot; Haig or Gough was facile and led to inconsistent conclusions. If the published draft was &quot;anti-&quot; Gough that it was surprising that he had called it a great improvement.

Green compared the volume with later studies and wrote that the narrative did not support an explanation of the delay from 7 June to 31 July, being caused by a need to divert the Germans from the French Army. On 7 May, Haig had decided to begin the Messines operation in early June but he had not been informed until 2 June of the state of French Army. Edmonds had written that the attack on Messines Ridge began on 7 June because of the difficulty of mounting three simultaneous attacks at Ypres. Edmonds ascribed the apparent delay from 7 June to 31 July, to Haig&#x27;s decision to give principal responsibility to Gough. Wynne had claimed that Edmonds failed to reveal the superiority of German tactics but in 1998, Prior and Wilson had shown that British tactics had evolved in 1917, although their application was inconsistent. Edmonds had demonstrated that the attack on Messines ridge was a cautious advance for . The plan incorporated progressive elements like those used at Arras on 9 April, particularly its emphases on counter-battery fire and a carefully controlled creeping barrage.

The Second Army had and howitzers, that fired of ammunition, times more than that available for the First Day on the Somme (1 July 1916), to counter the deep German defence zones and . Strongpoints were destroyed, wire was cut and German artillery suppressed. Three layers of creeping barrage deep preceded the infantry, who had been trained in the pillbox fighting methods used at Vimy Ridge. The infantry were followed by mopping-up parties, who captured by-passed German positions. Use of such techniques had been possible because the artillery had become more accurate. The gunners also had more ammunition to use and had been able to suppress German defences as the British advanced; objectives had been limited to the range of the artillery and had led to a great victory. Prior and Wilson wrote that these methods were not used on 31 July, because Haig had over-ruled Rawlinson, Plumer and Davidson; Gough over-reached and left the British infantry vulnerable to German counter-attacks. Edmonds had written that on 31 July, excessive demands had been placed on the artillery that spread its fire too thin.

Green wrote that at the end of August, Haig had turned to Plumer and bite-and-hold tactics and that Edmonds called this a radical revision. The greatest weight of artillery-fire possible was to be massed against the Gheluvelt plateau, for a succession of strictly limited attacks. Plumer planned four steps at six-day intervals, to give time to move artillery and supplies forward. The steps were limited to a depth of and a large increase in medium and heavy artillery was to be used to smash pillboxes and to add to the counter-battery effort. The Battle of the Menin Road Ridge (20–26 September) had double the number of guns on half the depth of attack, making four times the weight of shell compared to 31 July. Infantry tactics also emphasised systematic consolidation of captured ground and strongpoints. With the new battle drill and unprecedented artillery support, the attack was a great success. Green noted that Prior and Wilson described the battle as a triumph of reduced expectations and that Passchendaele Ridge was still away. Haig had then insisted on preparations for a breakthrough after the successes of the Battle of Polygon Wood (26–27 September) and the Battle of Broodseinde (4 October) but inadequate artillery preparation led to the failures at the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October) and the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October).

Green concluded that the publication of 1917 Part II in 1948 had much to awaken controversy, particularly the contrast between flawed tactics and the methods used with success earlier in 1917. Green wrote that the volume mostly accorded with modern writing and contained little bias regarding Haig. Edmonds had referred to the external constraints of lack of manpower and the state of the French Army, yet his narrative had made the military errors manifest; Haig&#x27;s desire for a breakthrough had led to a failure to relate strategy to tactics. Haig had failed to communicate with Plumer and Gough and had prolonged the offensive into the period of bad weather in early October. Green concluded that Edmonds had produced a work of lasting authority, in a series of substantial historical, military and literary value. Green wrote that later scholars who have accused Edmonds of bias, have had to acknowledge that his assessments and conclusions are largely accurate.

:::The Historical Section wanted quick publication to rebut recriminations and criticism of individuals in unofficial histories. George Gordon, commissioned in 1919, wrote three chapters and resigned before he was sacked. In 1923, Lieutenant-General Gerald Ellison, a staff officer at Gallipoli with confirmed views, took over and expanded first volume to nine chapters; criticised inefficiency and bungling, named culprits, including Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty (1911–1915). In 1924, the Committee for Control wanted redrafts to remove blame and references to politicians; Ellison refused and was asked to resign; Brigadier-General C. F. Aspinall-Oglander, another staff officer at Gallipoli with similar views, took over in 1925, retained much offending material, adding more using forms of words retaining the sense of criticisms, moving passages to different chapters or volumes, satisfying the committee but not Edmonds. A serial abridged edition was published in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1932. IWM-BP b/w maps published in 1992.

<doc id="1139835" wikidata="Q6562701" url="?curid=1139835" title="List of VFL/AFL pre-season and night series premiers">
<text>This page is a complete chronological listing of the pre-season and night series premiers of the Australian Football League (AFL), known as the Victorian Football League (VFL) until 1990. Although it spans three different competitions, the premierships are considered historically equivalent.

From 1956 to 1971, the first VFL Night Series was a consolation knock-out competition held in September at the Lake Oval in Albert Park amongst the eight teams who failed to reach the finals in the VFL premiership season – apart from 1957, when all twelve teams competed.

There were no official VFL night series held during the 1972 to 1976 seasons, although in 1976 the National Football League (the national governing body at the time) held its own night series mid-week during the season, known as the NFL Wills Cup. This led to the VFL reviving its own night series, now also held mid-week during the season among all clubs, and televised on Channel 7 to rival the NFL series that was shown on Channel 10. While the 1977 series only featured the twelve VFL teams, between 1978 and 1986 a selection of teams from the SANFL, WAFL and representative teams from Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania also competed. This became known as the Australian Football Championships Night Series and ran until 1987.

With the national expansion of the VFL to include teams from Western Australia and Queensland the 1987 series was restricted to only the 14 VFL teams and commenced during the pre-season period, but was completed mid-week between rounds 5 and 6 of the 1987 VFL season.

From 1988 until 2013, the competition was played in its entirety before the premiership season began and is competed for by only the VFL or AFL teams (the VFL was renamed the AFL in 1990), and became the Australian Football League pre-season competition. The preseason competition was abandoned in 2014, and replaced with discrete practice matches.

==Pre-season cup winners (1988–2013)==
^The Australian Football League was called the Victorian Football League prior to 1990.

From 2003 onwards, the pre-season cup competition has had a modified scoring system (not the usual scoring system that is used in the premiership season), that includes awarding 9 points for &quot;Super Goals&quot; that are kicked from outside the 50m arc and 3 points for rushed behinds.

The last pre-season premiership was awarded in 2013, as subsequent pre-season tournaments had no declared winner.

===Most pre-season cup competition wins (1988–2013)===

==Total pre-season and night series wins==
==Back-to-back night/pre-season winners==
==Double premiership teams==
The double premiership of winning both the night/pre-season and main premiership competitions has been achieved on seven occasions, by three clubs. In 2007, the AFL announced that if a club won both titles, they would win a $1 million bonus. The offer was not extended past that season, so neither St Kilda, who won the 2008 NAB Cup and made the preliminary final of the 2008 AFL season, nor Geelong, who achieved the double in 2009, were eligible for the extra prize money.

Four teams have won the pre-season premiership immediately after winning the main-season premiership. Carlton won the main VFL Premiership in 1982 and backed it up with a night premiership in 1983. Hawthorn won the AFL Premiership in 1991; they then backed it up the following year to win the pre-season competition in 1992. Essendon won the 1993 AFL Grand Final and then also won the 1994 Foster&#x27;s Cup. Collingwood won the 2010 AFL Grand Final and then also won the 2011 NAB Cup.

<doc id="1139843" wikidata="Q743362" url="?curid=1139843" title="São Jorge Island">
<text>São Jorge () is an island in the central group of the Azores archipelago and part of the autonomous region of Portugal. Separated from its nearest neighbours (Pico and Faial islands) by the Pico-São Jorge Channel, the central group is often referred colloquially as part of the &quot;Triângulo&quot; (&quot;Triangle&quot;) group or just &quot;The Triangle&quot;. São Jorge is a relatively long thin island with tall cliffs, whose 8,381 inhabitants are concentrated on various geological debris fields (&quot;fajãs&quot;) along the north and south coasts; from east to west, the island is long and, north to south, wide: its area is .

== History ==

It is unclear when the first explorers discovered the island of São Jorge; as part of the politics of human occupation, the Azores were populated after 1430 (probably 1439) through the initiative of Prince Henry the Navigator. 23 April, known as the feast day of Saint George, has been cited by historians as the reason for the island&#x27;s name, although this is likely conjecture. Genovese and Catalan maps of the 14th century originally designated the long, slender island &quot;São Jorge&quot;, a designation that was maintained by Infante D. Henrique when settlers from northern Europe began to colonize the island (around 1460, or twenty years after it was first sighted).

Although unclear, Azorean chroniclers believe that settlement on the island concentrated around the two communities of Velas and Calheta, and developed into the interior. It was in 1460 that the construction of the first church dedicated to São Jorge occurred in the area of Velas, from the testaments of Infante D. Henrique. What is certain is that the island was populated by the time that João Vaz Corte Real, the Donatary-Captain of Angra do Heroísmo (Terceira) obtained the captaincy of the island, by contract on 4 May 1483. By 1500, the settlement of Velas was elevated from villa to municipality (giving rise to the supposition that Velas was the first center on the island). By 1659, the parochial church had already undergone public restoration, that gave origin to the present church in that municipality.

After an unsuccessful adventure to the island of Flores, the Flemish nobleman Willem van der Haegen (later known as Guilherme da Silveira) moved to the area of Topo where he established and founded a local community, in 1480. After living there for several years he died and was buried in the chapel of the Casa dos Tiagos. Topo was eventually elevated to capital of the municipality by 1510, but lost this title to Calheta on June 3, 1534. During this period, the island was wild and many of the roads difficult or non-existent between the communities, resulting in isolated villages located along the coast. Connections between these communities developed by sea, and the better provisioned ports were likely to develop economically. This was the case with Calheta, Urzelina and Velas; the sites, although farther from the Terceira (the towns are located on the opposite coast), were preferred way-points due to secure and sheltered ports, with good anchorage and providing many goods and services. The growth of the population was rapid, and by the mid-17th century, São Jorge had approximately 3000 inhabitants and three towns: Velas, Topo and Calheta. The island demonstrated a strong economic vitality: in addition to wine, corn, and yam, it was also an important exporter of woad to Flanders and other countries in Europe.

The dynastic crisis (1580) caused by the ascension of King Philip II of Spain (King Philip I of Portugal) had consequences on the island, since gentry supported (along with those on Terceira) the pretender to the throne, António, Prior of Crato. King António reigned on the continent for about twenty days, until he was defeated at the Battle of Alcântra, whereupon he moved his court to Terceira Island and governed in opposition until 1583. The Habsburg-supported King Phillip finally defeated his forces at sea at the Battle of Ponta Delgada between July 25–26, 1582, and the garrisons in São Jorge only capitulated to the forces of Castillo after the fall of Terceira in 1583.

Following 1583, the island experienced a period of relative isolation, partially due to the poor quality of its ports and its limited economic importance. After the Spanish occupation, it was largely abandoned and its inhabitants were left to survive a meager existence. The island did not escape Atlantic piracy: the islanders were subject to attacks by English and French privateers in 1589 and 1590, raiders after 1590 (from the Barbary coast and lands occupied by the Turks) and during the 17th and 18th centuries (mostly around Calheta). In 1625, the inhabitants of Fajã de São João were captured by pirates and likely sold into slavery. The tranquillity around the island was also broken on September 20, 1708, when the town of Velas was attacked by French pirates under the command of René Duguay-Trouin. The population of the community resisted for twenty-four hours, but eventually the pirates made shore where they disembarked. The resistance, commanded by Sergeant-major Amaro Soares de Sousa, occurred around the village of Banquetas saving the other villages from occupation and pillaging.

During the Portuguese Civil War, Liberalist forces were stationed on the island after May 10, 1831. Generally, the island&#x27;s residents have lived for many years in isolation, interrupted by rare visits from the authorities, commercial boats from the local islands, and the occasional nobleman who has come to contemplate the local scenery.

With the inauguration of its ports, and the airport/aerodrome (April 23, 1982) commercial ventures have grown (especially the export of the local cheese), the expansion of animal husbandry, the fisheries and a small crafts industry.

== Geography ==
=== Physical geography ===
Unique among the islands of Azores, São Jorge is uncharacteristically long and slender and susceptible to ocean erosion. The island was built on fissural volcanism associated with the plate tectonics of the mid-Atlantic Ridge and a transform fault that extends from the Ridge to the island of São Miguel (referred to as the São Jorge Fault). Through successive fissural eruptions the island was built up: the only remnants of these forces are the line of volcanic cones that extend along the central ridge (approximately 700 metres in altitude).

The island was built up from successive morphological structures of progressively younger materials, these include:

* Topo Volcanic Complex - predominantly built of basalt, hawaiite, and mugearite lavas and pyroclastic deposits and Strombolian cinder cones. Materials in this formation were produced are about 600,000 years in age.
* Rosais Volcanic Complex - consisting of the northeastern portion of the island, with a similar composition to those materials in Topo.
* Manadas Volcanic Complex - most recent formation composed of Strombolian cones and two Surtseyan cones (Morro de Lemos and Morro Velho), as well as craters and tuff rings resulting from Phreatomagmatic activity.
The island is 55 km in length from the Ponta dos Rosais until the Topo Islet and a maximum width between Fajã das Pontas and Portinho da Calheta (approximately 7 km). The highest point is Pico da Esperança at 1,053 meters. The island has an area of 246 km2, with an obvious difference in the relief between the western and eastern portions of the island: the western coast is ringed with cliffs, while the eastern coast is morphologically smoother. Similarly, the contrast between the northern and southern coasts are obvious; apart from several deltas (fajãs) on both coasts, the northern coast has sharp cliffs, while the southern coast is less inclined. The majority of the cliffs in the northeast are between 300 and 400 m with severe slopes (between 45° and 55°). In this area, many of the fajãs, some composed of lavas (Fajã do Ouvidor, Fajã das Pontas and Fajã da Ribeira da Areia) and others dendritic (Fajã de João Dias and Fajã da Penedia), are visible. In the southwest the cliffs are approximately 100m in height and most settlements are located along the lava deltas, such as the Fajã das Velas, Fajã da Queimada, Fajã Grande and Fajã da Calheta.

===Eruption history===
Periods of local prosperity or misery occurred in the following years; there were several bad growing seasons and natural catastrophes (such as the earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tornados in 1580, 1757, 1808 and 1899) that created famines and hardships. The most famous of these eruptions began in the early morning of May 1, 1808 (Urzelina eruption). Suffocating gases, as well as carboxylic acid, were emitted from a vent along the Manadas ridge and thick greenish vaporous clouds (of chloric and sulfuric acids) rapidly spread to the plants. Eight major tremors were recorded per hour that caused widespread panic. Many of the homes, buildings and cultivatable lands were destroyed. Between 1580 and 1907, at least six significant eruptions occurred; ten people were killed during the 1580 eruption and eight in 1808. In 1850, the island&#x27;s vineyards were devastated by the phylloxera plague, which had a terrible effect on the economy until the development of the orange industry (about 1860). The island&#x27;s isolation ended after the completion of the ports of Velas and Calheta.

The last terrestrial volcanic eruption on the island of São Jorge was the eruption of “Vulcão da Urzelina” in 1808.

====2022 São Jorge Seismovolcanic crisis ====
From March 2022, São Jorge Island had been the location of a serious seismovolcanic crisis. The Instituto de Investigação em Vulcanologia e Avaliação de Riscos is following the crisis with a special webpage called &quot;&quot;. The alarm level on 26 March was 4, “this means that according to the alarm scale in force in the Azores archipelago we are in the pre-eruptive volcanic phase”.

=== Climate ===
Owing to its position in the mid-North Atlantic Ocean, influenced by the Gulf Stream, São Jorge has a humid subtropical climate with very mild winters and warm summers, although, being a generally elevated island, temperatures tend to be cooler on the hilly center and warmer downslope of the many fajãs that characterize the island. Water temperatures vary between while the average temperature varies between .

=== Human geography ===

The geomorphology of the island (its high cliffs, rough central plateaus and scattered fajãs) resulted in the concentration of human settlements along the coast. Historically these communities were linked by coastal ports since the trails in the interior were barely transitable. Consequently, communities were isolated from one another necessitating local solutions to common problems and building local ties between families. Velas, Calheta and Topo developed partially due to well developed ports and local economies, in addition to administrative necessity and central positions. The settlements developed with immigration from Spain and Flanders, principally by settlers brought by the Ávilas and by Willem van de Hagen.

Administratively, São Jorge is divided into two municipalities: Calheta in the east with five parishes and Velas in the west with six parishes. The rural population is basically aligned along the lines of communication divided by areas of unpopulated pastureland between localities.

== Economy ==

After a period of small subsistence agriculture, the local economy began to concentrate on a few chief exports: initially, lichen (Roccella tinctoria) and woad (Isatis tinctoria), later the introduction of wheat and corn crops. Woad was one of the most important exports from São Jorge and the Azores; it was initially introduced by Willem van der Hagen around 1490, and exported primarily to his countrymen in Flanders. Both woad and lichen were very popular in central Europe as a dye.

These exports were later superseded by grapes and wine after 1571 and endured for the next three centuries. It was first disseminated along the southern coast, owing to the fertile soils, and adapted well to many of the fajãs of Calheta (including Fajã dos Vimes, Fajã de São João, Fajã do Ouvidor, and Fajã Grande), as well as the areas between Ribeira do Almeirda and the parish of Queimadas (in Velas). These were generally considered lands that were not adequate for cereal cultivation, but where vineyards flourished. The majority of the wine production was located in the area between Queimada, Urzelina and Manadas, with grapes of the Verdelho and Terrantez castes, as well as some Bastardo, Moscatel and Alicante produced in an area that became lucrative and highly prized. Unlike the other islands, where grape vines grew on the rocky hedge-rows or around protective volcanic rocks, the grapes of São Jorge were grown between many of the natural species of bush and trees. Over the centuries many barrels of wine were produced in this method, and about 10,000 barrels were regularly exported or consumed locally. São Jorge wines were so highly esteemed that the Count of Almada, then Captain General of the Azores, created the &quot;São Jorge&quot; brand in order to mitigate fraudulent sales. The wine was also appreciated during the World Exposition of 1867 (in Paris, France) where it rivaled Porto wine. Unfortunately, the Oidium tukeri grape/vine disease reached the island in late 1854 and destroyed the prosperous industry. Various attempts were made to restart the wine industry, such as Francisco José de Bettencourt e Ávila, the Baron Ribeiro in the area of Urzelina, and later Miguel Teixeira Soares de Sousa and Marta Pereira da Silveira, who produced wine from the Izabela caste. Meanwhile, the phylloxera disease continued to destroy many of the vineyards in the municipality of Calheta during the second half of the 18th century, and throughout the island the disease would bring many producers to bankruptcy. The remnants of the viticulture of the island banded together around Casteletes, in Urzelina, which include João Inácio de Bettencourt Noronha, producing a new caste of wines around Urzelina and Fajã de São João.

Orange cultivation spread in the Azores around the 17th Century owing to the environmental conditions and the fertility of the lands. The export of oranges to the United Kingdom and North America was an important phase in the island&#x27;s economy; about six shipments per port were annually exported, which included about 7 million (or about 994,000 kilograms) oranges. Orange orchards were located primarily in the communities of Santo Amaro, Urzelina, Ribeira Seca and in Fajã de São Joãos.

Another crop to form a part of the culture of the Azores is the yam. It is widely popular and cultivated in any plot of land, and was used as an important subsistence food during the island&#x27;s formative years although never becoming a major export product. It was so important that it was included in the Coat-of-Arms of Calheta, since 1694.

Long before whale-watching became important, whaling was an important industry between the end of the 19th century and middle of the 20th century, where a majority of the inhabitants were tied exclusively to this economy. In strategic locations along the coast, small huts were built to watch-out for whales and give an alarm to the local hunters, who would sail out and harpoon the mammals. Later, when this hunt was prohibited, the islanders began to &quot;hunt&quot; Albacor and Bonito Tuna resulting in the creation of two processing plants in Calheta. Fishing continues to be an important part of the local economy, although whale-watching has turned into a part of local tourism.

While cereals, vineyards and local vegetables are still grown sporadically around the island (much like the other islands of the Azores) the economy of São Jorge is currently dependent on the dairy industry. The local São Jorge cheese has been the most important part of the local economy, resulting in the establishment of an order, the Confraria do Queijo de São Jorge, to promote the consumption and sale of this popular cheese. In addition, Uniqueijo &quot;União de Cooperativeas Agrícolas de Lacticínios de São Jorge&quot; (&quot;Cooperative Agricultural Union of São Jorge Dairy Producers&quot;) is the principal dairy-producer on the island. A union of eight cooperatives, Uniqueijo is dedicated to the commercialization of the traditional São Jorge cheese, including new products classified under the DOP &quot;Denominação de Origem Protegida&quot; (&quot;Denomination of Protected Origin&quot;) status.

==Culture, tradition and tourism==

===Festivities===
The principal festivals popular on the island are not dissimilar to those celebrated on the islands of the archipelago. There are the festivals of Espírito Santo that concentrate on the many impérios around the island, and are an important manifestation of the religious character of the islands. These festivals occur every Sunday during the seven weeks after Easter, and culminate on the seventh Sunday, Pentecosts, although some traditions vary from place-to-place. Generally, there are processions to the church and masses associated with this festival, but also include alms for the poor, the serving of a meat-soup-like broth (whose methods of preparation and serving vary from community to community) and gathering of the local citizens for conversation and/or dancing.

Velas&#x27; Semana Cultural (Culture Week) is also another festivity that mixes local traditions and cultural influences from abroad. During this week expositions and presentations of local Azorean culture are mixed with local concerts, bullfights, and finally a regata between Velas and Horta, Faial during the first week of July. Meanwhile, in the village of Calheta the Festival de Julho (the July Festival) highlights four days of festivities that brings together ethnic processions, musical comedies, theatrical presentations and local sports competitions.

The Romarias (religious pilgrimages) are a tradition of the island&#x27;s Catholic communities, and strongly linked to catastrophes associated with historical earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The Romaria de Nossa Senhora de Carmo, which occurs annually in the Fajã dos Vimes (July 16), and the Romaria do Santo Cristo in the Fajã da Caldeira de Santo Cristo, are popular processions where many faithful walk between religious sanctuaries in prayer and contemplation, usually stopping for Mass at local churches.

===Tradition===
The local gastronomy includes many Azorean basics, but includes local plates of fish and pork with an abundance of spices, typical of the communities visited by far eastern caravels during the Age of Exploration. Clam dishes are fairly common in São Jorge, being the only location in the archipelago where clams are discovered (usually in the Fajã da Caldeira de Santo Cristo). Generally there is an abundance of locals’ sweets for tourists, including coscorões, roquilhas de aguardente, espécies, suspiros, olvidados, bolos de véspera, cavacos, queijadas de leite, and açucareura branca. In addition, the traditional cornbread (made from white or yellow cornmeal) is still very popular, since wheat-based breads were generally for the privileged classes of the island. The Azorean yam was also an important base of the local diet, as well as an export product.

<text>Staffordshire is a landlocked county in the West Midlands of England. It adjoins Cheshire to the north west, Derbyshire and Leicestershire to the east, Warwickshire to the south east, West Midlands and Worcestershire to the south, and Shropshire to the west. The historic county of Staffordshire includes Wolverhampton, Walsall, and West Bromwich, these three being removed for administrative purposes in 1974 to the new West Midlands authority. The resulting administrative area of Staffordshire has a narrow southwards protrusion that runs west of West Midlands to the border of Worcestershire. The city of Stoke-on-Trent was removed from the admin area in the 1990s to form a unitary authority, but is still part of Staffordshire for ceremonial and traditional purposes.

The historic county has an area of 781,000 acres (1,250 sq. miles) and at the first census in 1801 had a population of 239,153.

==Iron Age and Roman==
Early British remains exist in various parts of the county; and a large number of barrows have been opened in which human bones, urns, fibulae, stone hammers, armlets, pins, pottery and other articles have been found. In the neighbourhood of Wetton, near Dovedale, on the site called Borough Holes, no fewer than twenty-three barrows were opened, and British ornaments have been found in Needwood Forest, the district between the lower Dove and the angle of the Trent to the south. Several Roman camps also remain, as at Knave&#x27;s Castle on Watling Street, near Brownhills.

==Anglo-Saxon==
The county symbol, the Staffordshire Knot, is seen on an Anglian stone cross that dates from around the year 805. The cross still stands in Stoke churchyard. Thus the Knot is either i) an ancient Mercian symbol or ii) a symbol adopted from the Irish Christianity, Christianity having been brought to Staffordshire by Irish monks from Lindisfarne about AD 650.

The district which is now Staffordshire was invaded in the 6th century by a tribe of Angles who settled about Tamworth, afterwards famous as a residence of the Mercian kings, and later made their way beyond Cannock Chase, through the passages afforded by the Sow valley in the north and Watling Street in the south. The district was frequently overrun by the Danes, who in 910 were defeated at Tettenhall, and again at Wednesfield, and it was after Edward the Elder had finally expelled the Northmen from Mercia that the land of the south Mercians was formed into a shire around the fortified burgh which he had made in 914 at Stafford.

The county probably first came into being in the decade after the year 913; that being the date at which Stafford – the strategic military fording-point for an army to cross the Trent – became a secure fortified stronghold and the new capital of Mercia under Queen Æthelflæd.

The county is first mentioned by name in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 1016 when it was harried by Canute.

==Norman Conquest==
The resistance which Staffordshire opposed William the Conqueror was punished by ruthless harrying and confiscation, and the Domesday Survey supplies evidence of the depopulated and impoverished condition of the county, which at this period contained but 64 mills, whereas Dorset, a smaller county, contained 272. No Englishman was allowed to retain estates of any importance after the Conquest, and the chief lay proprietors at the time of the survey were Earl Roger of Montgomery; Earl Hugh of Chester; Henry de Ferrers, who held Burton and Tutbury Castles; Robert de Stafford; William Fitz-Ansculf, afterwards created first Baron Dudley; Richard Forester; Rainald Bailgiol; Ralph Fitz Hubert and Nigel de Stafford. The Ferrers and Staffords long continued to play a leading part in Staffordshire history, and Turstin, who held Drayton under William Fitz Ansculf, was the ancestor of the Bassets of Drayton. At the time of the survey Burton was the only monastery in Staffordshire, but foundations of canons existed at Stafford, Wolverhampton, Tettenhall, Lichfield, Penkridge and Tamworth, while others at Hanbury, Stone, Strensall and Trentham had been either destroyed or absorbed before the Conquest.

==Later middle ages==
In the 13th century Staffordshire formed the archdeaconry of Stafford, including the deaneries of Stafford, Newcastle, Alton and Leek, Tamworth and Tutbury, Lapley and Creigull. In 1535 the deanery of Newcastle was combined with that of Stone, the deaneries remaining otherwise unaltered until 1866, when they were increased to twenty. The archdeaconry of Stoke-on-Trent was formed in 1878, and in 1896 the deaneries were brought to their present number; the archdeaconry of Stafford comprising Handsworth, Himley, Lichfield, Penkridge, Rugeley, Stafford, Tamworth, Trysull, Tutbury, Walsall, Wednesbury, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton; the archdeaconry of Stoke-on-Trent comprising Alstonfield, Cheadle, Eccleshall, Hanley, Leek, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stoke-on- Trent, Trentham and Uttoxeter.
In the wars of the reign of Henry III. most of the great families of Staffordshire, including the Bassets and the Ferrers, supported Simon de Montfort, and in 1263 Prince Edward ravaged all the lands of Earl Robert Ferrers in this county and destroyed Tutbury Castle. During the Wars of the Roses, Eccleshall was for a time the headquarters of Queen Margaret, and in 1459 the Lancastrians were defeated at Blore Heath.

==Hundreds of Staffordshire==
The five hundreds of Staffordshire existed since the Domesday Survey, and the boundaries have remained practically unchanged until the twentieth century. Edingale, however, was then included under Derbyshire, and Tyrley under Shropshire, while Cheswardine, Chipnall and part of Bobbington, now in Shropshire, were assessed under Staffordshire. The hundreds of Offlow and Totmonslow had their names from sepulchral monuments of Saxon commanders. The shire court for Staffordshire was held at Stafford, and the assizes at Wolverhampton, Stafford and Lichfield, until by act of parliament of 1558 the assizes and sessions were fixed at Stafford, where they are still held.

The origin of the hundred dates from the division of his kingdom by King Alfred the Great into counties, hundreds and tithings. From the beginning, Staffordshire was divided into the hundreds of Totmonslow, Pirehill, Offlow, Cuttleston and Seisdon. 
The hundredal division of Staffordshire differs markedly from that of the counties to the south and west in showing far greater stability. All the Domesday hundreds are kept practically unchanged down to modern times. Also in the size of the hundreds. The Staffordshire hundreds, five in number, are on the whole far larger than any in the adjacent counties; more especially as regards northern Staffordshire. The two hundreds in the south-west are of more normal extent. It seems to be due chiefly to the nature of the county. Northern Staffordshire is to a large extent moorland, which must have been unattractive to early settlers. It is noteworthy, as showing where the centres of these hundreds lay, that the meeting-places of the two northern hundreds (Pirehill and Totmonslow) are in the extreme south of the respective hundreds. Southern Staffordshire was largely a forest-district. The southern part of Seisdon hundred was covered by Kinver Forest, and large parts of the two hundreds in the central part of the county, those of Cuttleston and Offlow, must have been occupied by Cannock Forest. The cultivated areas of these hundreds must in early days have been considerably smaller than at present.

==Civil War==
In the English Civil War of the 17th century Staffordshire supported the parliamentary cause and was placed under Lord Brooke. Tamworth, Lichfield and Stafford, however, were garrisoned for King Charles, and Lichfield Cathedral withstood a siege in 1643, in which year the Royalists were victorious at Hopton Heath, but lost their leader, the Earl of Northampton. In 1745 the Young Pretender advanced as far as Leek in this county.

==Industrial history==
A large proportion of Staffordshire in Norman times was waste and uncultivated ground, but the moorlands of the north afforded excellent pasturage for sheep, and in the 14th century Wolverhampton was a staple town for wool. In the 13th century mines of coal and iron are mentioned at Walsall, and ironstone was procured at Sedgley and Eccleshall. In the 15th century both coal and iron were extensively worked. Thus in the 17th century the north of the county yielded coal, lead, copper, marble and millstones, while the rich meadows maintained great dairies; the woodlands of the south supplied timber, salt, black marble and alabaster; the clothing trade flourished about Tamworth, Burton, and Newcastle-under-Lyme; and hemp and flax were grown all over the county. The potteries are of remote origin, but were improved in the 17th century by two brothers, the Elers, from Amsterdam, who introduced the method of salt glazing, and in the 18th century they were rendered famous by the achievements of Josiah Wedgwood.

==Parliament==
Staffordshire was represented by two members in the parliament of 1290, and in 1295 the borough of Stafford also returned two members. Lichfield was represented by two members in 1304, and Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1355. Tamworth returned two members in 1562. Under the Reform Act 1832 the county returned four members in four divisions, and the boroughs of Stoke-upon-Trent and Wolverhampton were represented by two members each, and Walsall by one member. Under the Reform Act 1867 the county returned six members in three divisions and Wednesbury returned one member.

==Antiquities==
The most noteworthy churches in the county are found in the large towns, and are described under their respective headings. Such are the beautiful cathedral of Lichfield, and the churches of Eccleshall, Leek, Penkridge St Mary&#x27;s at Stafford, Tamworth, Tutbury, and St Peter&#x27;s at Wolverhampton. Checkley, 4 miles south of Cheadle, shows good Norman and Early English details, and there are carved stones of pre-Norman date in the churchyard. Armitage, south-east of Rugeley, has a church showing good Norman work. Brewood church, 4 miles south-west of Penkridge, is Early English. This village gives name to an ancient forest. Audley church, north-west of Newcastle-under-Lyme, is a good example of Early Decorated work. Remains of ecclesiastical foundations are generally slight, but those of the Cistercian abbey of Croxden, north-west of Uttoxeter, are fine Early English, and at Ranton, west of Stafford, the Perpendicular tower and other portions of an Augustinian foundation remain. Among medieval domestic remains may be mentioned the castles of Stafford, Tamworth and Tutbury, with that of Chartley, north-east of Stafford, which dates from the 13th century. Here is also a timbered hall, in the park of which a breed of wild cattle is maintained. Beaudesert, south of Rugeley, is a fine Elizabethan mansion in a beautiful undulating demesne. In the south-west, near Stourbridge, are Enville, a Tudor mansion with grounds laid out by the poet Shenstone, and Stourton Castle, embodying portions of the 15th century, where Reginald, Cardinal Pole, was born in 1500. Among numerous modern seats may be named Ingestre, Ilam Hall, Alton Towers, Shugborough, Patteshull, Keele Hall, and Trentham.

<text>Calheta () is a municipality on the island of São Jorge, in the Portuguese autonomous region of Azores. The municipality includes the eastern portion of the island of São Jorge and borders the municipality of Velas. The population in 2011 was 3,773, in an area of 126.26 km2.

==History==

The first reference to São Jorge was in 1439, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1470, when colonial nuclei dotted the southern and western coast: the first of these colonists were believed to have come from northern Europe. The municipality of Calheta, whose first settlers arrived around the 1480s (principally in the area of Topo, but later into the sheltered coves and fajãs) along the southern coast of the island). The island of São Jorge was ceded to João Vaz Corte-Real on 4 May 1483, becoming the first Captain-Donatario, thus initiating the primary settlement of the island. This phase of development is notable for the settlement of Willem van der Haegen, a Flemish pioneer of Azorean colonization who traveled and settled in Faial, Corvo and Terceira). His final resting place was in the settlement of Topo, which he founded with other Flemish settlers; he died in 1500, and was buried in the chapel-annex to the &quot;Solar dos Tiagos&quot;. Topo was later elevated to municipality and its village the municipal seat, on 12 September 1510.

Calheta was elevated to the status of town on 3 June 1534 by regal decree, issued by King D. John III.

Meanwhile, other settlements developed rapidly due to a number of sheltered anchorages and the fertility of the small fajãs where colonists established homes. Fajã de São João, one of this settlements along the southern coast, had settlers as early as 1550 (this is conjecture established from the Chapel of São João. In Topo, the community established a port in order to establish trade with Terceira (at that time the largest municipal and commercial center in the Azores). Other settlements radiated from the coastal beachheads and the growth of the number of colonists justified the de-annexation of the parish of Calheta from the municipality of Velas. Demonstrating an economic vitality (based on its vineyards, cereal crops, yams and the exploration of lichen roccella which was being exported to Flanders for use in the dye industry), it was elevated to the status of on 3 June 1534, by decree of King John III of Portugal.

Other calamities have affected the early inhabitants: several dry seasons, numerous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions (1580–1757, 1808 and 1980), and on 21 July 1694 there occurred another tragic conflict that would later be known as the &quot;Motim dos Inhames&quot; (&quot;The Taro Revolt&quot;). It was a peasant uprising against an imposed tax or tithe on taro production. Taro was a staple of the peasant class, and tax on these tuberculosis generated a large revenue for the administrative government. After three years of leniency, in 1692, Francisco Lopes Beirão (the local sheriff) ordered his agents to pressure the locals to pay their &quot;tax&quot;. This created tensions between the political and peasants classes, exploding into hostility in the community of Ribeira da Areia between citizens in the northern half of Calheta and tax-collectors from the village of Velas. Although this conflict was settled by the local vicar, Francisco Lopes Beirão petitioned the King, and he sent João de Soveral e Barbuda to São Jorge to determine and imprison the responsible parties. In the end many peasants, their supporters from the Council in Calheta and residents of Topo were interrogated, imprisoned and required to pay outstanding taxes. Many became penniless, died of famine, or were imprisoned in the Castle of São João Baptista, the prison in Angra do Heroísmo or the jail across the Canal in Horta. Future Calhetenses would use the leaves of the taro on their rifles in honour of the events.

The parochial Church of Santa Catarina was constructed following a fire that destroyed the original chapel (8 January 1639), that dated back to the early 16th century. As a convent was ordered constructed, on 12 May 1718, the church was also remodeled.

The Calhetense settlers did not escape the attacks and destruction caused by pirates in the waters of the archipelago. English and French privateers, in addition to Turkish and Algerian (Barbary Coast) pirates in the Canal between Pico and São Jorge, persisted during the 16-17th Centuries. In 1597, a section of the squadron commanded by the Count of Essex, attacked the village of Calheta. To repel the invaders, the inhabitants, hurled rocks (their only defense) from the cliffs at the English privateers attempting to reach the shore. During the battle, one Portuguese soldier, Simão Gote was able to rob the ensign of their flag, and escape with it victoriously. In the 18th century, the French corsair René Duguay-Trouin pillaged the settlements in São Jorge, and in 1816 an Algerian pirate, while attempting to hunt and capture a merchant clipper was shelled by the cannons in the local fort in Calheta.

The sheltered cove was elaborated in 1755, and a lighthouse constructed in 1873 to improve navigation and shipping.

In addition to the parochial church, the Church of Santo António was completed in 1816, along the Rua de Baixo which connects Calheta and Ribeira Seca.

The village was destroyed by the 9 July 1757 earthquake, which became known as &quot;Mandado de Deus&quot; (&quot;Sent by God&quot;); the earthquake (which was located off the northern coast of Calheta) was responsible for the complete destruction of the homes in the municipality and the death of 1200 people on the island.

The local philharmonic band was one of the earliest organizations to develop, and dates back to 1868.

A water network was completed in the principal urbanized area around 1878, with the completion of the local fountain.

==Geography==

The five parishes of Calheta are:
* Calheta
* Norte Pequeno
* Ribeira Seca
* Santo Antão
* Topo - it was the first municipality established on the island of São Jorge (currently fewer than 500 inhabitants), pioneered by a group of Flemish settlers, captained by Willem van der Haegen.

==Economy==
The base of economic activities in the region are cattle-raising, agriculture and the processing of fish. Two tuna-processing factories exist in this municipalities: one in Fajã Grande and the other in proximity to the port of Calheta. Due to overfishing, activities in these factories have been suspended. Consequently, plans to convert the factory into a tourist hotel have progressed for the factory in Calheta. Yet, it is the collection and transformation of milk to produce the famous Queijo de São Jorge that drives local activities.

Similarly, the Port of Calheta used to be a center for the construction of trans-Atlantic ships, but has since been used for local fishing and trans-shipment services.

As the central place in the southern eastern part of the island, the area includes various banks, commercial establishments, as well as the location of the Volunteer Fire Department and the home of the island&#x27;s Santa Casa da Misericórdia (home and support for the elderly). Over time, the influx of tourists has helped to transform the communities of the municipality, primarily due to the geological predominance of the fajãs in the region and the relatively unspoilt natural conditions in the interior. This has had the corollary effect of expanding the production and sale of local handicraft and traditional artisanal pastries/cookies.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
* Building of the Calheta Finance Office ()
* Lighthouse of Ponta do Topo ()
* Manor of the Noronhas (), the manorhouse was named for the rural landed-gentry of the period, and conveys an importance and wealth associated with the 16th century family who had ties with the Royal Household of Queen Catherine;
* Manor of the Tiagos (), displaying signeurial architecture of the period, this 18th- to 19th-century L-shaped building was constructed by the last Captain-major of Topo, Tiago Gregório Homem da Costa Noronha.

===Religious===
* Church of Santa Catarina (), construction began on 8 January 1639 after the original 16th century building was destroyed by fire, a legend grew up around it and annual processions were instituted to commemorate the religiosity of the events;
* Church of Nossa Senhora do Rosário (), one of the earliest temples constructed in the municipality, the church was built in the 16th century, by summarily destroyed in the often cited &quot;Mandado de Deus&quot; (&quot;Sent from God&quot;) earthquake and only completed in 1761;
* Church of São Lázaro ()
* Church of São Tiago ()
* Church of Santo Antão ()
* Sanctuary of Santo Cristo da Caldeira ()

==Culture==
The largest manifestation of local culture is exemplified in the popular activities associated with local philharmonic bands, the religiosity of its population and its association with the Cult of the Holy Spirit.

For many years, the Jorgense culture has been recognized in the local region for its musical abilities. The number of philharmonic bands at one time was greater than the number of civil parishes. Musical interest also extended to the traditional dances, where many played or danced to a folkloric style that included &quot;Chamarrita&quot;, &quot;Saudade&quot;, &quot;Samacaio&quot;, &quot;Pézinho&quot;, &quot;Lira&quot;, and &quot;Pêssegos&quot;. Many of the ethnographic groups that were formed in the 20th century were an attempt to protect and maintain these traditional dance forms and melodies, in addition to the typically rural dress associated a bygone age. Of note, the &quot;Grupo Etnográfico da Calheta&quot; (&quot;Ethnographic Group of Calheta&quot;) was recognized for its research and investigations into traditional music and dress.

==Notable citizens==
* Francisco de Lacerda, (Wiki PT) (Riberia Seca, 11 May 1869 — Lisbon, 18 July 1934) composer, musicologist and folklorist, was considered one of the best musical directors in 19th century Europe. Leaving his home Fajã da Fragueira for the world, he passed through various cities on the continent (Porto and Lisbon in particular), before settling in France, where he continued his roles in music, abdicating a promising course in medicine.

<doc id="1139878" wikidata="Q17016455" url="?curid=1139878" title="History of Warwickshire">
<text>This is about the history of the County of Warwick situated in the English Midlands. Historically, bounded to the north-west by Staffordshire, by Leicestershire to the north-east, Northamptonshire to the east, Worcestershire to the west, Oxfordshire to the south, Gloucestershire to the south-west, an exclave of Derbyshire to the far north, and less than 400 yards from the border with Shropshire in the far west.

Areas historically part of Warwickshire include Coventry, Solihull, Sutton Coldfield, much of central Birmingham (including the city centre, Aston, Edgbaston and Erdington), Meriden, Knowle, Dorridge, Balsall Common, Berkswell and Hampton-in-Arden, which all became part of the metropolitan county of West Midlands (Sutton Coldfield becoming part of Birmingham) following local government re-organisation in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. The county also included the eastern half of Tamworth (including the castle) and its suburbs, and the parish of Ipsley which nowadays comprises roughly half of suburban Redditch, which were ceded to Staffordshire in 1888 and Worcestershire in 1931, respectively, as well as the Tutnall and Cobley exclave, which was ceded to Worcestershire as part of the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.

Much of northwestern Warwickshire, including that area now forming part of Coventry, Solihull and Birmingham, was covered by the ancient Forest of Arden which was still the case at the time of the Domesday Book but much of which was later cut down to provide fuel for industrialisation. Thus the names of a number of places in the northwestern part of Warwickshire end with either the Old English &quot;ley&quot; or &quot;leah&quot; meaning a clearing in a forest or latterly the phrase &quot;-in-Arden&quot;, such as Henley-in-Arden, Hampton-in-Arden and Tanworth-in-Arden. Historically, the &quot;-in-Arden&quot; suffix has also been used variously for many other places in the area, primarily for parochial purposes. Stoneleigh-in-Arden is perhaps the most notable example, while other examples such as Coleshill-in-Arden, Kenilworth-in-Arden and Knowle-in-Arden were seldom used. Even at the time of the Domesday Book the forested area has been calculated to be a quarter of the whole county or half of the northern area, the &quot;Arden&quot;. The remaining southern area, not part of the forest, was called the Felden – from &quot;fielden&quot;. Historically, two towns dominate the county, Warwick, the county town and Coventry an important medieval city.

==Prehistoric==
The Warwickshire area has almost certainly been inhabited since Prehistoric times, with the arrival of the first people half a million years ago during the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. Small family groups roamed the thickly wooded landscape in search of food using simple stone tools such as hand-axes and scrapers. The total population of the area in those days may have been as low as 40. There is evidence of a temporary camp site at Waverley Wood Farm Pit, near Leamington Spa, whilst elsewhere, particularly in north Warwickshire, large numbers of hand-axes have been found suggesting repeated visits. This early phase came to an end with the onset of the Ice Age during which there is no evidence of a human presence in Warwickshire. Between 100,000 and 20,000 years ago, most of Warwickshire would have been submerged beneath Lake Harrison.

Human groups returned to the area around 10,500 years ago at the beginning of the Mesolithic period or Middle Stone Age. As the climate became warmer and the ice sheets retreated, the habitat changed and the forest was re-established. These people were hunter-gatherers who used bows and arrows and had domesticated dogs to help them in the chase. This period is characterised by the use of microliths, small delicately worked points set into arrowshafts. Other flint tools were used for working wood and bone and for cleaning skins. Some 20 sites are known in Warwickshire of which the most important is Blacklow Hill, near Warwick. Excavations here have revealed a substantial tool-making site. Other sites are known in the Avon valley and intensive fieldwork around Nuneaton has produced a large number of finds and evidence of several settlement sites.

Around 6,000 years ago the hunter-gatherer way of life was gradually being replaced by a simple farming economy, thus further modifying their habitat.
These Neolithic or New Stone Age people raised sheep, pigs and cattle, and grew cereal crops. They used fire and stone axes to make clearings in the woodland where they could build farms and lay out fields. A flint arrowhead from this period has been recovered from Wolston.

The Bronze Age was a time of change, the scattered farming communities were coming together into tribal groups with powerful leaders. Metal was now in use and objects were being made out of copper and bronze. There are a number of weapons such as swords and spearheads cast in bronze found in Warwickshire. There is also evidence of people taking care of their appearance, two bronze razors have been recorded recently in South Warwickshire. Warwickshire being a rich agricultural area farming continued to expand and by 1500 BC much of the woodland had been cleared and settled.

In the Iron Age, the area contained small farmsteads such as the settlement at Wasperton, near Warwick. The main building was a thatched round house where the family and some of the livestock lived and around it workshops, storehouses and stock pens. The whole settlement was surrounded by a deep ditch which kept out wild animals. During times of trouble the population may have taken refuge in one of a number of hillforts such as Meon Hill near Stratford or Oldbury near Nuneaton. The remains of around twelve Iron Age hill forts have been found in the Warwickshire area.

==Roman period==
For the first few decades following the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43, the Warwickshire area found itself at the frontier of Roman rule. The Watling Street and Fosse Way Roman roads were constructed, the Fosse Way marking the western frontier of Roman rule in Britain for several decades. The area was heavily fortified during this period and several military settlements were founded to defend the roads. Ryknild Street was constructed across the Warwickshire area and a fort was established in what is now the grounds of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The fort was built in about 48 AD by the Roman army as a base camp for its conquest of the Birmingham area and part of a network of forts across the Midlands linked by roads. It stood by Birmingham&#x27;s earliest known road junction at the point where Icknield Street was met by Roman roads coming in from Droitwich and Penkridge. From here the road runs north to another fort over the county border into Staffordshire at Wall, Roman Etocetum near Lichfield.

Following the revolt in AD60/1 of the Iceni under their Queen Boudica most scholars have assumed that, after the burning of Colchester and London, Boudica followed Suetonius up Watling Street as he headed for his supply bases and lines of communication near to the milItary frontier. Suetonius offered battle in a strong defensive position described by Tacitus and many fruitless attempts have been made to be more precise regarding the site of the Battle of Watling Street, the last battle of Boudica. The historian, Dr Graham Webster has suggested it took place near Manduessedum (&quot;the place of the war chariots&quot;), modern day Mancetter and military finds of armour and military coinage relating to the 14th Legion, whom Tacitus records formed part of Suetonius&#x27; army, have been found in the region, giving weight to Webster&#x27;s hypothesis. Another possible site put forward by Jack Lucas is the area east of Rugby, and whilst other theories exist for locations outside of Warwickshire, the exact location is unknown. After the defeat of the Iceni reinforcements were sent by the Romans from Germany and a great supply base was set up at a place called the Lunt in Baginton near Coventry which has the unique feature of a circular arena or gyrus for the breaking in of horses and which could have been a collecting point for Iceni horses after the battle.

Of Roman settlements in Warwickshire one of significant size was &quot;Alauna&quot; (modern day Alcester). Alcester was an important Roman settlement of around eighteen hectares laying bestride Ryknild Street in a loop of the River Arrow to the west of its confluence with the River Alne, underlying the modern town. Town defences have been confirmed only on the east side of the settlement&#x27;s circuit, where they consist of a clay rampart dated to the &quot;second century or later&quot;, fronted by a 2.75-metre wide wall which was probably not contemporary with the bank. There is also a suspected Roman fort around one kilometre to the south-east of the known Roman settlement located on Primrose Hill which overlooks both the confluence of the River Arrow with the River Alne and the junction of Ryknield Street with the road south from the Roman settlement at Salinae Droitwich Spa, known as the Salt Way after the main export from the area in Roman times. Items of bronze were recovered include a harness ring with a masked loop typical of those used by auxiliary cavalry. The earliest occupation date based on these findings appears to be Flavian. Other significant Roman settlements included Tripontium near Rugby and Manduessedum near Atherstone. The area around Manduessedum is known to have had an extensive pottery industry, which extended to near what is now Nuneaton, the remains of up to thirty pottery kilns having been found in this area.

==Anglo-Saxon period==

Covering the period from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Norman Invasion of 1066.

After the Romans left Britain in the 5th century, the Warwickshire area was settled by Anglo Saxon tribes with the southern half initially belonging to the Hwicce and the northern half a core part of the Kingdom of Mercia. While its earliest boundaries will never be known, there is general agreement that the territory that was called &quot;the first of the Mercians&quot; in the Tribal Hidage covered much of south Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and Northern Warwickshire.

Following the decline of the Mercian kingdom during the early 9th century, large parts of Mercia to the east of Warwickshire were ceded in 878 to Danish (Viking) invaders by King Alfred&#x27;s Treaty of Wedmore with the Danish leader Guthrum. Watling Street, on the north-eastern edge of Warwickshire, became the boundary between the Danelaw to the east and the much reduced Mercia to the west.

Owing to its location at the frontier between two kingdoms, what is now Warwickshire needed to establish defences against the threat of Danish invasion. Between, 911 and 918 this task was undertaken by the &quot;Lady of the Mercians&quot; Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred, who was responsible for defences against the Danes at Tamworth (&quot;see&quot; Tamworth Castle) in 914 and the building of the first parts of Warwick Castle in 916. Periodic fighting between Danes and Saxons occurred until the 11th century. The establishment of the burh by Æthelflæd in 914 and Warwick&#x27;s subsequent status as a shire town must have given some impetus to economic development. The town was, at any rate, sufficiently important to have had one of the two royal mints set up in Warwickshire (the other was at Tamworth). Coins are first known to have been issued in the reign of Athelstan (925-39). In the early 11th century, new internal boundaries within the Mercian kingdom were drawn and Warwickshire came into being as the lands administered from Warwick. The county was initially divided into ten hundreds, their names as given in the Domesday Book, were &#x27;Berricestone&#x27;, &#x27;Bomelau&#x27;, &#x27;Coleshelle&#x27;, &#x27;Fernecumbe&#x27;, &#x27;Fexhole&#x27;, &#x27;Honesberie&#x27;, &#x27;Meretone&#x27;, &#x27;Patelau&#x27;, &#x27;Stanlei&#x27;, and &#x27;Tremelau&#x27;, they were reduced to four &#x27;sipesochae&#x27; — an early term which appears to be used exclusively in Warwickshire — in the 12th century and were named Barlichway, Hemlingford, Kineton or Kington, and Knightlow. The first recorded use of the name Warwickshire being in the year 1001, named after Warwick (meaning &quot;dwellings by the weir&quot;). Warwickshire was invaded in 1016 during the Christmas period by Cnut as part of his ultimately successful invasion against Æthelred the Unready and his son Edmund Ironside, destroying Coventry and massacring the local saint, Osberg, virgin and martyr.

==Middle Ages==

From the Norman invasion of 1066 to the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

The Norman conquest in 1066 brought with it the most active and notable period of military architecture resulting in the building of much of Warwick Castle and others at Kenilworth Maxstoke and Tamworth. Others existed at Allesley, Ansley, Aston Cantlow, Baginton, Beaudesert, Bickenhill, Birmingham, Brandon, Brinklow, Caludon at Wyken, Castle Bromwich, Coleshill, Coventry, Fillongley, Fulbrooke, Hartshill, Rugby and Studley, but in many cases only the earthworks can now be seen.

Many of the main settlements of Warwickshire were established in the Middle Ages as market towns, including Birmingham, Bedworth, Nuneaton, Rugby and Stratford-upon-Avon amongst others.

The county was dominated throughout the medieval period by Coventry which became one of the most important cities in England and an important centre of wool and textiles trades. The city has held the title of episcopal see, Lichfield and Coventry, from the time of Earl Leofric early in the 11th century arising from the monastery he and his wife, Godiva, founded in 1043. Henry VI and his queen Margaret of Anjou made several visits to Coventry, and in 1451, as a mark of favour, Coventry and certain hamlets and villages adjacent became an entire and separate county, the County of the City of Coventry and the Bailiffs raised to the rank of Sheriffs. The Parliamentum Diabolicum assembled in Coventry in 1459 to pass bills of attainder for high treason against the Duke of York and other Yorkist nobles at the start of a new stage of the Wars of the Roses. The citizens remained loyal to Henry, and the Lancastrian cause, in his struggle with Edward IV and when Edward reached the city in 1470, the gates were closed against him. However, when Edward was safely seated on the throne, he withdrew the privileges of the city, only restoring them on payment of a fine of 500 marks

==Tudor and Stuart==

From the accession of Henry VII in 1485 till the accession of the Hanoverian dynasty under George I in 1714.

Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned at Coventry in 1566, where she lodged in the house of the mayor and again in 1569 where she was confined in the Bull Inn.

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a Warwickshire conspiracy. The conspirators&#x27; principal aim was to kill King James, however another important objective was the kidnapping of the King&#x27;s daughter, third in the line of succession, Princess Elizabeth. Housed at Coombe Abbey near Coventry, the Princess lived only ten miles north of Warwick, convenient for the plotters, most of whom lived in the Midlands. Once the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen. Robert Catesby, the prime mover in the conspiratory, was a Warwickshire man, born probably at Bushwood, near Lapworth and John Grant, whose house at Northbrook, Snitterfield, was the rendezvous and powder magazine of the conspirators, was of the gentry of the county. Other conspirators rented houses in the neighbourhood, Ambrose Rokewood rented Clopton House, near Stratford, Everard Digby, to whom the task of rousing the Catholic gentry of the Midlands was assigned rented Coughton Court the home of the Throckmortons under the guise of a &quot;hunting party&quot;. The Wrights moved to Lapworth and the rooms in London were rented by Thomas Percy from Henry Ferrers whose home of Baddesley Clinton was in turn rented to the Vaux sisters, relatives of Catesby. After the discovery of the plot and the arrest of Guy Fawkes was known, the conspirators rode from London to Warwickshire, meeting Digby&#x27;s hunting party at the Red Lion at Dunchurch to discuss their plans. 
The final flight took place on 6 November, the fugitives raided Warwick Castle for supplies and continued to Norbrook to collect weapons. From there they continued their journey to Huddington. Thomas Bates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army. Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their &quot;wicked actions&quot;, before himself fleeing. The closing events now take place out of Warwickshire as they continued on to Holbeche House near Kingswinford in Staffordshire where they were captured.

During the English Civil War in the 17th century the county was generally on the Parliamentarian side, Lord Brooke of Warwick Castle being one of the fiercest enemies of the king. The Battle of Edgehill (1642) was fought in Warwickshire, near the Oxfordshire border. Prince Rupert, who was in charge of the Royalist forces, marched his soldiers through Henley in Arden in 1643 on his way to Birmingham and pillaged the neighbourhood. Charles II was assisted in his escape following his defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651 by Jane Lane who, disguising the king as her man-servant accompanied him across the county, passing through Wooton Wawen, Stratford-upon-Avon and Long Marston. The footpath the Monarch&#x27;s Way commemorates the events and approximates the route of his escape where the modern landscape permits.

==Modern period==

From the accession of George I to the present day.

During the 18th and 19th centuries Warwickshire became one of Britain&#x27;s foremost industrial counties. The coalfields of northern Warwickshire were amongst the most productive in the country, and greatly enhanced the industrial growth of Coventry and Birmingham. One notable exception was the town of Leamington Spa which grew from a small village to a medium-sized town during the 19th century on the back of the fashionable spa water tourist movement of the time.

Warwickshire became a centre of the national canal system, with major arterial routes such as the Oxford Canal the Coventry Canal and later, what is now the Grand Union Canal being constructed through the county.

One of the first intercity railway lines: the London and Birmingham Railway ran through Warwickshire. And during the 19th century, the county developed a dense railway network.

Towns like Nuneaton, Bedworth, and Rugby also became industrialised. The siting of a major railway junction in the town was the key factor in the industrial growth of Rugby.

Towards the end of the 19th century Birmingham and Coventry had become large industrial cities in their own right, and so administrative boundaries had to change. In 1889 the administrative county of Warwickshire was created, and both Coventry and Birmingham became county boroughs which made them administratively separate from the rest of Warwickshire. Solihull later followed as a county borough. These boroughs remained part of the ceremonial county of Warwickshire, which expanded into Worcestershire and Staffordshire as Birmingham annexed surrounding villages.

This situation lasted until 1974, when the two cities along with Solihull were removed from Warwickshire altogether, and along with parts of Staffordshire and Worcestershire became a part of the new West Midlands metropolitan county.

The remaining post-1974 county of Warwickshire was left with a rather odd shape, which looks as if a large chunk has been bitten out of it where Coventry, Solihull and Birmingham used to be.

<doc id="1139882" wikidata="Q4739355" url="?curid=1139882" title="Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union">
<text>The Amalgamated Marine Workers&#x27; Union (AMWU) was a trade union of sailors, firemen and ship-board service personnel which existed in the United Kingdom between 1922 and 1927.

It was a merger of the British Seafarers&#x27; Union and the National Union of Ship&#x27;s Stewards, both of which were opposed to the principal trade union in the shipping industry, the National Sailors&#x27; and Firemen&#x27;s Union.

At the outset, the AMWU expressed an ambition to replace the NSFU and ultimately to become part of the recently established Transport and General Workers Union. But several factors limited the union&#x27;s effectiveness. It faced resistance from both the NSFU and the Shipping Federation, which collaborated through the National Maritime Board to control access to employment in the shipping industry. The AMWU also suffered from severe internal divisions.

In 1923 and 1925, the AMWU once again found itself unsuccessfully resisting wage reductions. In the latter instance, its effectiveness was limited by the refusal of its general secretary (Joe Cotter) to sign cheques, and the consequent impossibility of accessing union funds. The union also lost ground at this time to the Seamen&#x27;s Section of the National Minority Movement (formed 1924), which attracted many of those seafarers who were most determined to resist the reductions. The Minority Movement, which was sponsored by the Communist Party and included black activist seafarers in this xenophobic period, was suspicious of the AMWU. Such activists regarded the AMWU as a sectional organisation.

In 1926, a former member of the National Union of Ship&#x27;s Stewards launched a legal challenge to the union&#x27;s status, alleging that the ballot which brought about the merger of the two organisations had not been properly conducted. The AMWU lost this challenge and, as a result, was unable to access its funds. Despite the efforts of its National Organiser, Manny Shinwell, the AMWU was wound up in early 1927.

<text>The West Midlands region straddles the historic borders between the counties of Warwickshire (Birmingham and Coventry), Staffordshire in the north, and Worcestershire in the south.

==Economic history==
Coventry was one of England&#x27;s most important cities during the Middle Ages, its prosperity built upon wool and cloth manufacture. Birmingham and Wolverhampton have a tradition of industry dating back to the 16th century when small metal-working industries developed. Birmingham was known for its manufacture of small arms, whereas Wolverhampton became a centre for lock manufacture and brass working.

Birmingham and Coventry became important centres of the car industry from the early 20th century. The Austin car plant was built in 1905 at Longbridge, to the south of Birmingham, and gradually expanded over the next 75 years, but closed down in 2005 on the bankruptcy of MG Rover. Since 2007, part of the former Longbridge plant has been retained by new owners Nanjing Automobile for the production of MG Cars. Cars produced at the Longbridge plant included the Austin Seven (launched in 1922), the Mini (1959), BMC/BL 1100/1300 saloons and estates (1962) and Austin Metro (1980).

Coventry became the centre of the British car industry, dominated by the Jaguar plant near Coundon, the Triumph plant at Canley, and the Rootes Group&#x27;s Ryton plant just beyond the city&#x27;s eastern boundary. However, the Canley plant was closed by British Leyland in 1980, followed more than 20 years later by the Jaguar plant, and finally the former Rootes plant (taken over by Peugeot at the end of the 1970s), meaning that there was virtually no vehicle production remaining in Coventry by 2007.

Castle Bromwich Assembly was built in the late 1930s for the manufacture of Spitfire aircraft, which continued throughout World War II. Aircraft manufacturing at the plant continued until 1977, when it was sold to Jaguar for car production. The factory remains in use four decades later. Around the same time that the Castle Bromwich Assembly was built, the government built a shadow factory at Solihull, which produced aircraft for the war effort. After the war, the plant was taken over by Rover cars, who relocated from their Lode Lane plant in Coventry. The Land Rover, Britain&#x27;s first four-wheel drive off-road vehicle, was first produced at the Solihull factory in 1948. The factory expanded and increased in productivity over the subsequent decades to allow for the production of Rover, Land Rover and more recently Jaguar cars.

The coal and iron ore deposits of the Black Country area provided a ready source of raw material. The area grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, and by the 20th century had grown into one large conurbation. However, the Black Country&#x27;s coal mining industry was in decline by the early 20th century and the last coal pit in the area, Baggeridge Colliery at Sedgley, closed in 1968. Heavy industry began to decline in the 1970s and 1980s, with towns including Bilston, Darlaston, Wednesbury, Tipton and Brierley Hill being hit particularly hard by factory closures. However, new lighter industry began to develop in some of these areas, with a large retail park developing in the north of Wednesbury during the 1990s and a light industrial estate being built in the south of the town. Brierley Hill became home to the Merry Hill Shopping Centre, which developed between 1985 and 1990. Many of the former industrial sites in Tipton, however, have been mostly developed for new housing. Oldbury has retained a significant amount of manufacturing while also enjoying a significant growth in the retail sector, with a string of retail developments having appeared around the town since 1980.

Coventry was slower to develop, but by the early 20th century had become an important centre for bicycle and car manufacture, soon becoming Britain&#x27;s most important area for car manufacturing. The city&#x27;s population soared during the interwar years as a result, and expansion continued after World War II, along with rebuilding following the city&#x27;s severe wartime bomb damage. A number of factories were built in the city for the wartime effort, including a Daimler shadow plant in the north-west of the city, which was taken over by Jaguar in 1951 and remained the carmaker&#x27;s main site until 2005, when the factory was closed and the company concentrated on its factories at Castle Bromwich near Birmingham and the Halewood plant (originally a Ford facility) near Liverpool. The Rootes Group, whose brands including Hillman, Singer and Sunbeam, opened a factory at Ryton to the east of the city at the start of World War II, and in peacetime it was converted for car production. Such was the success of the company in the postwar era that it opened another factory at Linwood in Scotland in 1963, just before its takeover by American carmaking giant Chrysler, but financial difficulties saw the company being taken over by French carmaker Peugeot in 1978. From 1986, the plant was used by Peugeot for production of its own cars after it discontinued the Talbot brand, but in December 2006 the plant was closed down, leaving the city with virtually no car industry remaining.

The growth of the area in the 19th century, which attracted thousands of families from rural communities, led to extensive building of houses across the region. Many villages grew into towns, while others swallowed up neighbouring communities. However, this led to overpopulation in many areas, with a large percentage of the region&#x27;s population living in unfit housing by the early 20th century. This led to the extensive construction of council housing, mostly on new suburban housing estates. Notable developments in the region during this era include Weoley Castle in Birmingham, Low Hill in Wolverhampton, the Priory Estate in Dudley, Friar Park in West Bromwich and Blakenall Heath in Walsall.

The region suffered significant air raid damage by the Luftwaffe during World War II, with thousands of buildings damaged and people killed or seriously injured in Birmingham and Coventry, while there was a lesser degree of bomb damage in towns including Dudley, Tipton and West Bromwich. Several of the less densely populated areas, including Sedgley, Stourbridge and Halesowen, suffered little or no bomb damage.

The rebuilding of the region continued after World War II. The region&#x27;s first multi-storey flats were built in the 1950s, although these were mostly built in the larger towns where space for housebuilding was already very limited. Some of the region&#x27;s population was rehoused in the new town of Telford in Shropshire which was developed mostly in the 1960s and 1970s, or in expanded towns like Redditch in Worcestershire. The largest housing development in the Midlands during the postwar era was the Castle Vale estate in Birmingham, which was dominated by multi-storey flats, with 34 blocks being built. Many inner city areas and town centres became less densely populated as a result of this continued regeneration of housing.

The area also became connected to the new motorway network in the 1960s, with the M5 motorway terminating between Walsall and West Bromwich, and when completed it gave the region a direct link to areas in the south of England including Bristol and Exeter. The M6 motorway joined up with the M1 motorway to the south, giving the area a direct motorway link to London, and gave a direct motorway link to Liverpool and Manchester in the north. The M42 motorway was developed around the south of Birmingham to serve Birmingham Airport as well as nearby towns including Redditch, Bromsgrove and Tamworth, during the 1970s and 1980s. The M54 motorway, linking the area with Telford, was built around the same time. The M40 motorway was completed in January 1991, giving the area its second motorway link with London, as well as improving its links with the South Coast seaports of Southampton and Portsmouth, along with the university city of Oxford.

In 2003, Britain&#x27;s first toll motorway, the M6 Toll, opened, bypassing the West Midlands to the north.

==Sport==

The West Midlands also has a strong association with professional sport.

Warwickshire CC, the highly successful county cricket team, is based at Edgbaston, Birmingham.

Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers were all founder members of the Football League in 1888, and were joined within a few years by Birmingham City and later a fifth team, Walsall. Aston Villa were the English league&#x27;s most successful teams during its first 25 years, winning the league title and FA Cup on many occasions, as well as being the first winners of the Football League Cup in 1961, and one of several English teams to have won the European Cup when they lifted it in 1982. West Bromwich Albion were league champions in 1920 and had won the FA Cup five times by 1968, as well as the League Cup in 1966. Wolverhampton Wanderers enjoyed their most successful era during the 1950s, when they were league champions three times, and have also won a total of four FA Cups and two League Cups. Birmingham City have been less successful, their only two major trophies being two victories in the Football League Cup, while Walsall have yet to reach the top division of English football or win a major trophy.

==Civic history==

During the 20th century a number of attempts were made to improve the local government of the area.

The West Midlands was one of five &quot;Special Review Areas&quot; named in the Local Government Act 1958. The Local Government Commission for England established by the Act was charged with: 
:&quot;the duty of reviewing the organisation of local government... and of making such proposals as are hereinafter authorised for effecting changes appearing... desirable in the interests of effective and convenient local government.&quot;

The West Midlands Special Review Area was almost identical to the metropolitan county as created in 1974 (with the exception of the Meriden Gap and Coventry).
The commission&#x27;s report lead to a substantial reform in the local government of the area in 1966 as the patchwork of county boroughs with municipal boroughs and urban districts in between was replaced by a core of county boroughs covering a contiguous area. The former Royal Borough of Sutton Coldfield was absorbed into Birmingham, while an expanded Wolverhampton borough took in Bilston, Wednesfield and Tettenhall as well as a large section of Coseley and smaller sections of areas including Sedgley. The Borough of Dudley was also expanded, taking in most of Sedgley and Brierley Hill as well as the southern section of Coseley. An expanded West Bromwich borough took in the bulk of Tipton and Wednesbury, while the Walsall borough was expanded to take in Darlaston and Willenhall. The County Borough of Warley was also created, centred on the former boroughs of Oldbury, Smethwick and Rowley Regis.

On 1 October 1969, West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority was established, which covered the county boroughs, the urban districts bordering these, as well as Cannock, Redditch and some surrounding rural districts.

The Redcliffe-Maud Report commissioned by Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party government recommended that a large &quot;metropolitan area&quot; be created around the Birmingham/Black Country conurbation, also including its rural hinterland. This was to have been divided into seven districts: Mid-Staffordshire (Tamworth, Rugeley, Lichfield, Cannock, Stafford), Wolverhampton, Walsall, Dudley, West Bromwich-Warley (later Sandwell), Birmingham/Solihull, North Worcestershire (Bewdley, Kidderminster, Bromsgrove, Redditch).

In the event the Conservative government of Edward Heath was elected in 1970 and the original plans for local government reform were radically altered. The West Midlands county was created in 1974, under the Local Government Act of 1972.

This area was based on the seven county boroughs and four other non-county boroughs and urban districts around the fringe of the conurbation – Aldridge-Brownhills, Halesowen, Stourbridge, and Sutton Coldfield. The area was divided into seven new metropolitan boroughs – Aldridge-Brownhills was added to Walsall; Halesowen and Stourbridge to Dudley and Sutton Coldfield to Birmingham. A new borough of Sandwell was formed by the merger of West Bromwich and Warley, Solihull took in much of the suburban fringe to the east of Birmingham and the gap between Solihull and Coventry, whilst Wolverhampton and Coventry were also included, with their boundaries very much the same as they had been since the 1966 reorganisation.

This led to (apart from in the east, with Coventry and the Meriden Gap) quite a tightly defined metropolitan border, excluding such places as Burntwood, Bromsgrove, Cannock, Kidderminster, Lichfield and Wombourne which had been considered for inclusion in the West Midlands metropolitan area by the Redcliffe-Maud Report, but excluding only a small amount that was considered part of the contiguous built-up area of the West Midlands conurbation in 2001.

The inclusion of Coventry into the new county was at the time highly controversial, as many people felt that Coventry had more in common with the surrounding Warwickshire area then with the Birmingham conurbation. There have been calls for Coventry to be more integrated with the surrounding Warwickshire area – which to some extent have been heeded with the creation of a Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust and a C&amp;W chamber of commerce.

The 1974 reform created a West Midlands County Council that covered the entire area and dealt with strategic issues. A new West Midlands Police service was formed covering the entire area, with the West Midlands Constabulary and Birmingham City Police abolished, and also taking over responsibility from the county forces.

Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government abolished the metropolitan county councils with the Local Government Act 1985, in 1986, causing the seven metropolitan boroughs to become de facto unitary authorities. This move also saw the abolition of the Greater London Council as well as the metropolitan councils for Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Tyne and Wear, Humberside and Avon.

<text>[[Sussex]] , from the Old English &#x27;Sūþseaxe&#x27; (&#x27;South Saxons&#x27;), is a historic county in South East England.

Evidence from a fossil of Boxgrove Man (&quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;) shows that Sussex has been inhabited for at least 500,000 years. It is thought to be the oldest human fossil ever discovered in Britain.

Near Pulborough, tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last Neanderthals in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans. On the South Downs lie Neolithic flint mines that date to around 4000BC, some of the earliest in Europe. The county is also rich in remains from the Bronze Age and Iron Age.

Prior to Roman invasions it was occupied by a Belgic tribe called the Atrebates. Togidubnus ruled over much of Sussex when the Roman conquest of Britain began and formed most of the Roman canton of the Regni.

The retreat of Roman forces in the 5th century facilitated the landing of migrants from what is now Germany and created the kingdom of the South Saxons under King Ælle, who is recorded as having held overlordship over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and as being the first bretwalda, or &#x27;Britain ruler&#x27;. Under St Wilfrid, Sussex became the last of the seven traditional kingdoms of the heptarchy to undergo Christianisation. By the 8th century the kingdom had expanded to include the territory of the Haestingas. Around 827 in the aftermath of the battle of Ellandun, Sussex was annexed by the kingdom of Wessex, a kingdom that with further expansion became the kingdom of England.

In 1066 Norman forces arrived in Sussex, the heartland of King Harold Godwinson. Defeating Harold at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror established five (later six) semi-independent territories known as rapes within Sussex. The South Saxon see was transferred from Selsey Abbey to a new cathedral in the city of Chichester. Castles were built, many the subject of sieges in the High Middle Ages. Sussex was of strategic importance on the most direct route between Angevin lands in England and Normandy. Many Sussex ports, including the Cinque Ports, provided ships for military use.

A succession crisis in the kingdom of France led to the Hundred Years War in which Sussex found itself on the frontline. Various rebellions followed in the late medieval period, including the Peasants’ Revolt, Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion and the rebellion of the Merfold brothers.

Under Henry VIII, the church in England split from Roman Catholicism. Mary I returned England to Catholicism and in Sussex 41 Protestants were burned to death. Under Elizabeth intolerance continued on a lesser scale as many Catholics in Sussex died at this time. In Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, Sussex was open to the older Protestant forms practised in the Weald as well as the newer Protestant forms coming from Continental Europe; combined with a significant Catholic presence, Sussex was in many ways out of step with the rest of southern England. Sussex escaped most of the ravages of the Civil War with two sieges and one battle.

As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the Wealden iron industry collapsed. The growth of the seaside resorts in the 18th century was especially significant in Sussex. Sussex men played a significant role in the first world war Battle of the Boar&#x27;s Head. At the war&#x27;s end terms of the Armistice were agreed at Danny House. In World War Two the county was a base for the Dieppe Raid and D-Day landings.

In 1974, the Lord-Lieutenant of Sussex was replaced with one each for East and West Sussex, which became separate ceremonial counties. In the 21st century a county day and a county flag were created for Sussex and a National Park was established for the South Downs.

==Prehistoric Sussex==
===Stone Age===
In 1993 a human-like tibia was found at Boxgrove near Chichester. Then in 1996 further hominid remains were found: two incisor teeth from a single individual recovered from the lower freshwater deposits at the site. The remains came to be known as &quot;Boxgrove man&quot; and are thought to be a species known as &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;. Boxgrove man apparently lived in a temperate stage immediately prior to the Anglian glaciation, in the Lower Paleolithic period between 524,000 and 478,000 years ago.
In 1900 Upper Palaeolithic flintwork was found at a site in the Beedings. Then in 2007–08 Early Upper Palaeolithic archaeology was found at the same site. The archaeology at the Beedings spans a crucial cultural transition in the European Palaeolithic and therefore provides an important new dataset for the analysis of late Neanderthal groups in northern Europe and their replacement by modern human populations.

It is believed that during the Mesolithic Age nomadic hunters arrived in Sussex from Europe. At the time (8000 BC), Britain was still connected to the continent, however the ice sheets over northern Europe were melting rapidly and causing the gradual rising of sea levels, which eventually led to the forming of the Straits of Dover, effectively cutting off the Mesolithic people of Sussex from the continent. There have been archaeological finds from these people, mostly in the central wealden area to the north of the Downs. Large amounts of knives, scrapers, arrow heads and other tools have been found.
Close to the River Ouse near Sharpsbridge, a polished axe, polished axe fragments, a chisel and other examples of Neolithic flintwork have been found. The fact that these implements were found close to the River Ouse suggests that some land clearance may have taken place in the river valley during the Neolithic period.

From about 4300 BC to about 3400 BC the mining of flint for use locally and also for wider trade was a major activity in Neolithic Sussex. There was also a Neolithic pottery industry, with styles of pot reminiscent of finds elsewhere, such as Hembury and Grimston/Lyle Hill.

===Bronze Age===

From the Bronze Age (about 1400-1100BC) settlements and burial sites have left their mark throughout Sussex. The transition from the late neolithic to the Early Bronze Age in Sussex is marked by the appearance of Beaker pottery. There have been several finds including some in Beaker settlements; a significant settlement was one discovered near Beachy Head in 1909. The site was partially excavated in 1970 and the finds included pottery, flints, post settings, shallow pits and a midden.

The presence of Beaker pottery provides the first evidence of the migration of people from northern Europe since the early Neolithic period. In the 1980s some pre-historians doubted the existence of the Beaker people as migrants and suggest that it was possible that the Beaker culture may have just been a new development of the local neolithic people. However more recently, the analysis of ancient human DNA, has enabled scientists to establish that the British Beaker populations were in fact more closely related to those originating from central Europe and that the presence of Beaker people in Britain was just part of the continuing east-to-west expansion that had brought Steppe-related ancestry into central and northern Europe.

===Iron Age===
There are over fifty Iron Age sites that are known throughout the Sussex Downs. Probably the best known are the hill-forts such as Cissbury Ring. A small number of agricultural settlements, or farmsteads, have been excavated on a large scale.

The results of these excavations have provided a picture of the economy, based on mixed farming. Artefacts such as iron ploughshares and sickles were excavated. The presence of animal bones, particularly cattle and sheep, attests to the pastoral element to their economy. Various items have been found that indicate that they used to spin and weave the wool they produced. The Sussex Iron Age dwellers supplemented their diet with marine shellfish, the remains of which have been found on several sites.

Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75BC, people from the Atrebates, one of the tribes of the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and German stock, started invading and occupying southern Britain. This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under Julius Caesar that temporarily occupied the south-east in 55BC. Then, soon after the first Roman invasion had ended, the Celtic Regni tribe under their leader Commius occupied the Manhood Peninsula.

Tincomarus and then Cogidubnus followed Commius as rulers of the Regni.
At the time of the Roman conquest in AD 43 there was an &quot;oppidum&quot; in the southern part of their territory, probably in the Chichester region.

==Roman Sussex==
After the Roman invasion Cogidubnus was installed or confirmed by the Romans as ruler of the Regni and he took the name Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus and claimed to be ‘&#x27;rex magnus Britanniae&#x27;’. His name is mentioned in two exceptionally early Roman inscriptions in his capital of Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester).

There are a variety of remains in the county from Roman times, coin hoards and decorated pottery have been found.

There are examples of Roman roads such as:
* Chichester to Silchester Way
* Chichester to London Stane Street

Also a variety of buildings, the best known being:
* Bignor Roman Villa
* Fishbourne Roman Palace
* Anderitum (Pevensey Castle)

The coast of Roman Britain had a series of defensive forts on them, and towards the end of the Roman occupation the coast was subject to raids by Saxons. Additional forts were built against the Saxon threat, an example in Sussex being Anderitum (Pevensey Castle). The coastal defences were supervised by the Count of the Saxon Shore.

There is some suggestion that around the beginning of the fourth century the Roman authorities recruited mercenaries from the German homelands to defend the southern and eastern coasts of Britain. The area they defended was known as the &quot;Saxon Shore&quot;. It is possible that these mercenaries remained after the departure of the Roman army and merged with the eventual Anglo-Saxon invaders.

==Kingdom of Sussex==


The foundation of the Kingdom of Sussex is recorded by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the year AD 477, saying that Ælle arrived at a place called Cymenshore in three ships with his three sons and killed or put to flight the local inhabitants.

The foundation story is regarded as somewhat of a myth by most historians, although the archaeology suggests that Saxons did start to settle in the area in the late 5th century. The Kingdom of Sussex became the county of Sussex; then, after the coming of Christianity, the see founded in Selsey was moved to Chichester in the 11th century. The See of Chichester was coterminous with the county borders. In the 12th century the see was split into two archdeaconries centred at Chichester and Lewes.

Having fought on the banks of the Mearcredesburna, it seems Ælle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty. After Ælle&#x27;s forces seized the Saxon Shore fort of Anderida, the South Saxons were able to gradually colonise free of Romano-British control and extend their territory westwards to link with the Saxon settlement at Highdown Hill. Ælle was recognised as the first &#x27;Bretwalda&#x27; or overlord of southern Britain.

It has been conjectured that, as Saxon war leader, Ælle may have met his death in the disastrous battle of Mount Badon, where the Britons halted Saxon expansion. The Britons were thought to have been led by Ambrosius Aurelianus, although there is no evidence for him being present at the battle. 

For much of the 7th and 8th centuries, Sussex was engaged in conflict with the kingdom of Wessex to its west. King Æðelwealh formed an alliance with Christian Mercia against Wessex, becoming Sussex&#x27;s first Christian king. With support from St Wilfrid, Sussex became the last major Anglo Saxon kingdom to become Christian. South Saxon and Mercian forces took control of what is now east Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

In about 685 Eadric of Kent revolted against his uncle (Hlothhere of Kent) and with help from Æðelwealh raised a South Saxon army that defeated Hlothhere in battle. Eadric then became sole ruler of Kent. 

Also in 685, a warband led by the West Saxon prince Cædwalla killed Æðelwealh and &quot;ravaged Sussex by fierce slaughter and devastation&quot;. Cædwalla was subsequently driven out of Sussex by two of Æðelwealh&#x27;s ealdormen, Berhthun and Andhun. William of Malmesbury suggests that Eadric became king of the South Saxon kingdom at that time. It is also possible that Sussex could have re-emerged as a regional power. When Cædwalla eventually became king of Wessex, he returned to Sussex, killing its king and oppressing its people, putting them in what Bede called &quot;a worse state of slavery&quot;.
After the departure of Wilfrid, the South Saxon Diocese was absorbed by the Diocese of the West Saxons, at Winchester. However, by AD 705 the West Saxon Diocese had grown to such a size that it became unwieldy to manage, so Ine of Wessex, Cædwalla&#x27;s successor, resolved with his witan to divide the great diocese. Accordingly, a new see was created at Sherborne and four years later the See of South Saxons was reinstated.

Following a period of rule by King Offa of Mercia, Sussex regained its independence but was annexed by Wessex around 827. In 860, following the death of Æthelbald king of Wessex, Sussex was fully absorbed into the realm of Wessex.

==Late Saxon Sussex==
Viking raids took place on Sussex in the following years. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in 895 the people of Chichester fought off a large force of raiders, slaying many hundreds of them, and took some of their ships. After the Battle of Edington, in Wessex, Alfred the Great constructed an integrated network of fortifications and defence with a system of fortresses, known as &quot;burhs&quot;, at its centre. Alfred was able to make it difficult for the Vikings to seize strategically important towns and ports. In Sussex &quot;burhs&quot; were built at Chichester, Burpham, Lewes, Hastings and &quot;Eorpeburnan&quot;.

&quot;Burhs&quot; also had secondary roles as economic centres, safe havens in which trade and production could take place. Some of the &quot;burhs&quot; became the administrative centres of their districts, headed by &quot;thegns&quot;, or chieftains. The fortifications seem to have protected Sussex well from attack.

By the ninth century, of the many Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, only four remained, namely Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia. Of those four kingdoms, Wessex became dominant and eventually, by Æthelstan&#x27;s reign (927 to 939), had absorbed the other kingdoms into the one Kingdom of England. 

During the reign of Æthelred the Unready there was renewed conflict with the Danes. In 998 the Vikings established a base on the Isle of Wight from which they could launch attacks and in 1000 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported that &quot;everywhere in Sussex they plundered and burnt as is their custom&quot;.

After the Danish king Cnut the Great took the English throne in 1016, there was a brief flowering of Saxon culture in Sussex, as peace returned. Churches were built and wall paintings were created across Sussex, including at Bosham, Sompting, Worth, Jevington, Sullington and Clayton.

Under Cnut&#x27;s kingship, Godwin, Earl of Wessex rose to prominence. A son of Wulfnoth Cild, a South Saxon &quot;thegn&quot;, Godwin was also popular in Sussex. When Godwin refused an order from Edward the Confessor to punish the people of Dover following a violent clash between the people of Dover and Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, King Edward sent Godwin and his family into exile. On his return from exile in 1052 Godwin received a hero&#x27;s welcome in Sussex. After Cnut&#x27;s death, Godwin&#x27;s daughter, Edith married Edward the Confessor and Godwin&#x27;s son Harold became the last Saxon king of England. Godwin and Harold used Bosham and Pevensey as naval bases from which they protected the coast from pirate raids.

Norman influence was already strong in Sussex before the Conquest: the abbey of Fécamp had interest in the harbours of Hastings, Rye, Winchelsea and Steyning; while the estate of Bosham was held by a Norman chaplain to Edward the Confessor.

==Norman Sussex==

On Friday, 13 October 1066, Harold Godwinson and his English army arrived at Senlac Hill, just outside Hastings, to face William of Normandy and his invading army. On 14 October 1066, during the ensuing battle, Harold was killed and the English defeated. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county&#x27;s thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. The Normans buried their dead in mass graves. There were reports that the bones of some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside some years later.

Harold held troops in key strategic locations, such as Hastings, Pevensey and Bosham. Bosham was probably Harold&#x27;s military headquarters, close to his naval headquarters on the Isle of Wight, and from where he could send messages to London.

William built Battle Abbey at the site of the battle of Hastings, and the exact spot where Harold fell was marked by the high altar. After the Norman conquest the 387 manors that had been in Saxon hands were replaced by just 16 heads of manors.

The 16 people, in charge of the manors, were known as the &quot;Tenentes in capite&quot; in other words the chief tenants who held their land directly from the crown. The list includes nine ecclesiasticals, although the portion of their landholding is quite small and was virtually no different from that under Edward the Confessor. Two of the lords were Englishmen, Ode (also known as Odo of Winchester), who had been a pre-Conquest treasurer, and his brother Eldred. This means that 353 of the 387 manors in Sussex would have been wrested from their Saxon owners and given to Norman Lords by William the Conqueror.

The county was of great importance to the Normans, Hastings and Pevensey being on the most direct route for Normandy. Because of this the county was divided into five new baronies, called rapes, each with at least one town and a castle. This enabled the ruling group of Normans to control the manorial revenues and thus the greater part of the county&#x27;s wealth.

William the Conqueror gave these rapes to five of his most trusted Barons:
* Roger of Montgomery - the combined Rapes of Chichester and Arundel.
* William de Braose - Rape of Bramber.
* William de Warenne - Rape of Lewes
* Robert, Count of Mortain - Rape of Pevensey
* Robert, Count of Eu - Rape of Hastings

Historically the land holdings of each Saxon lord had been scattered, but now the lords&#x27; lands were determined by the borders of the rape. The unit of land, known as the hide, in Sussex had eight instead of the usual four virgates,(a virgate being equal to the amount of land two oxen can plough in a season).

The county boundary was long and somewhat indeterminate on the north, owing to the dense forest of Andredsweald. Evidence of this is seen in the Domesday Book by the survey of Worth and Lodsworth under Surrey, and also by the fact that as late as 1834 the present parishes of North and South Ambersham in Sussex were part of Hampshire.

==Sussex under the Plantagenets==
During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Sussex found itself on the frontline, convenient both for intended invasions and retaliatory expeditions by licensed French pirates. Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea were all burnt during this period and all three towns became part of the Cinque Ports, a loose federation for supplying ships for the country&#x27;s security. Also at this time, Amberley and Bodiam castles were built to defend the upper reaches of navigable rivers.

==Early modern Sussex==
Like the rest of the country, Sussex felt the effects of the Church of England&#x27;s split with Rome during the reign of Henry VIII. In 1538 there was a royal order for the demolition of the shrine of Saint Richard in Chichester Cathedral, with Thomas Cromwell saying that there was &quot;a certain kind of idolatry about the shrine&quot;. In the reign of Queen Mary, 41 people in Sussex were burnt at the stake for their Protestant beliefs. Elizabeth re-established the break with Rome when she passed the 1559 Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity. Under Elizabeth I, religious intolerance continued, albeit on a lesser scale, with several people being executed for their Catholic beliefs.

Sussex escaped the worst ravages of the English Civil War, although in 1642 there were sieges at Arundel and Chichester, and a skirmish at Haywards Heath when Royalists marching towards Lewes were intercepted by local Parliamentarians. The Royalists were routed with around 200 killed or taken prisoner. Despite Sussex being under Parliamentarian control, a heavily disguised Charles II was able to evade capture on his journey through the county after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 and make his escape to France from the port of Shoreham.

==Late modern and contemporary Sussex==
The Sussex women are very nice in their dress and in their houses. The men and boys wear smock-frocks more than they do in some counties.
The Sussex coast was greatly modified by the social movement of sea bathing for health, which became fashionable among the wealthy in the second half of the 18th century. Resorts developed all along the coast, including at Brighton, Hastings, Worthing, and Bognor.

At the beginning of the 19th century, agricultural labourers&#x27; conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing number of them becoming unemployed, while those still working faced their wages being forced down. Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the House of Lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers (seasonal workers) had been found dead of starvation.

The deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots, first in neighbouring Kent, and then in Sussex, where they lasted for several weeks, although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the Swing Riots.

During World War I, on the eve of the Battle of the Somme on 30 June 1916, the Royal Sussex Regiment took part in the Battle of the Boar&#x27;s Head at Richebourg-l&#x27;Avoué. Over a period of less than five hours 17 officers and 349 men were killed. Twelve sets of brothers were amongst the dead, including three from one family. A further 1,000 men were wounded or taken prisoner. The day subsequently became known as &quot;The Day Sussex Died&quot;.

With the outbreak of World War II, Sussex found itself part of the country&#x27;s frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the Battle of Britain and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed. As the Sussex regiments served overseas, the defence of the county was undertaken by units of the Home Guard with help from the First Canadian Army. During the lead up to the D-Day landings, the people of Sussex were witness to the build-up of military personnel and materials, including the assembly of landing crafts and construction of Mulberry harbours off the county&#x27;s coast.

==Governance==
Since its creation in the fifth century, Sussex has been subject to periodic reform of its local governance. After the Reform Act 1832 Sussex was divided into the eastern division and the western division. These divisions were coterminous with the two original archdeaconries of Chichester and Lewes. In 1889, following the Local Government Act 1888, Sussex was divided into two administrative counties, East Sussex and West Sussex, using those same boundaries, together with three self-governing county boroughs, Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings.

In the post-war era, the New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of a new town.

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the county boundaries were revised with the mid-Sussex area of East Grinstead, Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and Hassocks being transferred from East Sussex into West Sussex. The Gatwick area that was formerly part of Surrey was transferred to West Sussex. As part of the Local Government Act 1972, the eastern and western divisions of Sussex were made into the ceremonial counties of East and West Sussex in 1974. Boundaries were changed and a large part of the rape of Lewes was transferred from the eastern division into West Sussex, along with Gatwick Airport, which was historically part of the county of Surrey. The county boroughs were returned to the control of the two county councils but in 1997 the towns of Brighton and Hove were amalgamated as a unitary local authority and in 2000, Brighton and Hove was given city status.

Although it is administered as the two ceremonial counties of East and West Sussex, there continue to be a range of organisations that operate throughout the ancient borders of Sussex, such as the Diocese of Chichester, Sussex Police, the Sussex Archaeological Society, the Sussex History Society, and the Sussex Wildlife Trust. In 2007, Sussex Day was created to celebrate Sussex&#x27;s rich culture and history. Based on the traditional emblem of Sussex, a blue shield with six gold martlets, the flag of Sussex was recognised by the Flag Institute in 2011. In 2013, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of England&#x27;s 39 historic counties, including Sussex.

==Jurisdiction==

The system of hundreds had been introduced during the time of the Saxons. In the 7th century Sussex has been estimated to have contained 7,000 families or hides. The creation of the rapes by the Normans introduced boundaries that divided some of the hundreds (and also some of the manors) causing a certain amount of fragmentation. The Arundel Rape covered nearly all of what is now West Sussex until about 1250 when it was split into two rapes, the Arundel Rape and the Chichester Rape. Ultimately Sussex was divided into six rapes; Chichester, Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings.
At the time of the Domesday Survey, Sussex contained fifty nine hundreds. This eventually increased to sixty-three hundreds and remained unchanged till the 19th century, with thirty eight retaining their original names. The reason why the remainder had their names changed was probably due to the meeting-place of the hundred court being altered. These courts were in private hands in Sussex, held by either the Church or the great barons and local lords.

Independent from the hundreds were the boroughs.

The county court had been held at Lewes and Shoreham until 1086, when it was moved to Chichester. A petition to Parliament of 1336 from the &#x27;community of Sussex&#x27; asked to have a place assigned for the holding of the county court. After several changes the (19 Hen. 7. c. 24), during the reign of Henry VII, arranged for it to be held alternately at Lewes and Chichester.

In 1107–1109 there was construction of a county gaol, in Chichester Castle. The castle was demolished in around 1217 and another gaol built on the same site. That gaol is known to have been used until 1269, when the site of the prison was given to the Greyfriars to build a priory. In 1242 the counties of Surrey and Sussex were formerly united, and a sharing of prison accommodation resulted almost immediately. Sussex men were imprisoned in Guildford gaol. There were requests for the provision of a county gaol in both Chichester and Lewes at various times to no avail. However the national gaol system became overloaded during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, and the earl of Arundel was obliged to imprison people in his castles at Arundel and Lewes. Thus Sussex managed to get a county gaol again at Lewes in 1487 and there it remained until it was moved to Horsham in 1541 for a period.

In the middle of the 16th century, the assizes were usually held at Horsham or East Grinstead. In the middle of the 17th century, a gaol was built in Horsham, then in 1775 a new gaol was built to replace it. In 1788 an additional gaol was built at Petworth, known as the &quot;Petworth House of Correction&quot;. There were further &quot;Houses of Correction&quot; built at Lewes and Battle.

It is believed that the last case of someone being executed by being pressed to death (peine forte et dure), in the country, was carried out in 1735 at Horsham. At the assizes a man who pretended to be dumb and lame was indicted for murder and robbery. When he was brought to the bar, he would not speak or plead. Witnesses told the court that they had heard him speak so he was taken back to Horsham gaol. As he would not plead they laid weight on him, then as he still would not plead, they added more, and a further making a total of weight, still he would not speak; so more was added, when he was nearly dead, the executioner, who weighed about or , laid down upon the board which was over him, and killed him in an instant.

In 1824 there were 109 prisoners in Horsham Gaol, 233 in Petworth House of Correction, 591 in Lewes House of Correction and 91 in Battle House of Correction. The last public hanging in Sussex was at Horsham in 1844, a year before the gaol finally closed.

The sheriff&#x27;s function was to be responsible for the civil justice within the county. Surrey and Sussex shared one sheriff until 1567 when the function was split. Then in 1571 the two counties again shared one sheriff, finally each county was given their own sheriff in 1636. The office of High Sheriff for Sussex then continued until 1974 when it was ended by the local government re-organisation that split Sussex into the two counties of East and West Sussex.

During time of internal unrest or foreign invasions it was usual for the monarch to appoint a lieutenant of the county. The policy of appointing temporary lieutenants continued until the reign of Henry VIII, when Lords Lieutenant were introduced as standing representatives of the crown. The first &quot;Lord Lieutenant&quot; of the County of Sussex was Sir Richard Sackville in 1550; the Lord Lieutenant was usually also the custos rotulorum of the county and Sackville had been given that the year before. The main duties of the Lords Lieutenant was to oversee the military in the county; in Sussex this was the Militia and the Sussex Yeomanry.

As with the Sheriff, the post of Lord Lieutenant of Sussex was ended, in 1974, by the local government re-organisation. There are now separate Sheriffs and Lords Lieutenant for East and West Sussex and the modern day role is largely ceremonial.

Private jurisdictions, both ecclesiastical and lay, played a large part in the county. The chief ecclesiastical franchises were those of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of Chichester and also that of Battle Abbey, which was founded by William the Conqueror. The main lay franchises were those of the Cinque Ports and the Honour of Pevensey. The Cinque Ports were a group of coastal towns in Kent and Sussex that were given ancient rights and privileges. The main rights were the exemption of taxes and duties and the right to enforce the laws in their jurisdiction. In return for these privileges they were duty bound to provide ships and men in the time of war for the crown.

Traditionally when a collection of lands owned by the Crown is held in tenancy then the tenant is known as the tenant-in-chief and the lands held in such a way was called an &quot;honour&quot;. The Honour of Pevensey was a collection of estates in Sussex. The Honour of Pevensey was also known as the &quot;Lordship of Pevensey Castle&quot; or the &quot;Honour of The Eagle&quot; after the lords of L&#x27;Aigle who invariably were the tenant-in-chief. The name L&#x27;Aigle (French for eagle) is supposedly derived from a town in Normandy, named after an eagle that had built its nest in the area.

==Borough English in Sussex==

Borough-English was the custom that lands should descend to the youngest son or daughter, or, in default of issue, to the youngest brother of the deceased. The name originated from a case in Nottingham in 1327 when the English borough, or part of the town, held to ultimogeniture and the French (Norman) part to primogeniture. In Sussex, inheritance by Borough-English could still be found on 134 manors after 1750.

Gavelkind was the practice of partible or equal inheritance, as opposed to primogeniture. It was predominant in Kent but was also found, across the county border, in Sussex. It existed in Rye, in the large manor of Brede, and in Coustard manor (in Brede parish).

Borough-English and gavelkind were finally abolished in England and Wales by the Administration of Estates Act 1925.

==Religion==
Several polytheistic religions, including Celtic polytheism and Roman religion, were practised in Sussex before Christianity was firmly established there in the 7th century. Christianity was practised during part of the Romano-British period, but was replaced in the 5th century by the polytheistic religion of the South Saxons. According to Bede, it was the last area of what was to become England to be converted. After the Council of London of 1075 decreed that sees should be centred in cities rather than vills, the South Saxon diocese, with its see at Selsey was transferred to Chichester.

As was the case in the rest of the country, the Church of England&#x27;s split with Rome during the reign of Henry VIII was felt in Sussex. There had been twenty years of religious reform, when the Catholic, Mary Tudor succeeded to the throne of England in 1553. Mary&#x27;s persecution of Protestants earned her the nickname &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;. The number of Protestants burnt at the stake during her reign was around 288 nationwide and included 41 in Sussex. Most of the executions in Sussex were at Lewes.

In 1851 the authorities organised a census of places of worship in England and Wales. The figures for Sussex indicated that there were more Anglican than non-conformist places of worship. In the neighbouring counties of Hampshire and Kent, there were more non-conformist places than Anglican.

==Parliamentary history==


The parliamentary history of the county began in the 13th century. In 1290, the first year for which a return of knights of the shire is available, Henry Hussey and William de Etchingham were elected.

In 1801 the Members of Parliament (MPs) for the counties on the south coast of England were elected to a third of all the seats in Parliament, although they represented only about 15% of the nation&#x27;s population. The design of the country&#x27;s electoral system had changed little since the first parliament in 1295. The counties each returned two MPs and each borough designated by royal charter also returned two MPs. This produced the situation where some of the towns of the north that had grown large during the Industrial Revolution had no representation whereas smaller towns in the south that had been important in medieval times were still able to have two MPs.

Although there had been various proposals to reform the system since 1770, it was not until 1830 that a series of factors saw the Reform Act 1832 introduced. The larger industrial towns of the north were enfranchised for the first time and smaller English boroughs (known as rotten boroughs) were disenfranchised, including Bramber, East Grinstead, Seaford, Steyning and Winchelsea in Sussex. The Representation of the People Act 1884 and the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 (together known as the Third Reform Act) were responsible for redistributing 160 seats and extending suffrage.

After the Reform Act 1832 Sussex was divided into the &quot;eastern division&quot; and the &quot;western division&quot; and two representatives were elected for each division. In June 1832 the Honorable C.C. Cavendish and H.B. Curteis Esquire were elected in the eastern division and the Earl of Surrey and Lord John George Lennox were elected for the western division. There was a total of 3478 votes cast in the eastern division and 2365 votes in the western division.

Before the 1832 reform two members each had been returned by Arundel, Chichester, Hastings, Horsham, Lewes, Midhurst, New Shoreham (with the Rape of Bramber) and Rye. Arundel, Horsham, Midhurst and Rye were each deprived of a member in 1832, Chichester and Lewes in 1867, and Hastings in 1885. Arundel was disfranchised in 1868, and Chichester, Horsham, Midhurst, New Shoreham and Rye in 1885.
Under the new system the constituencies were based on unit numbers rather than historic towns. The reforms of the 19th century made the electoral system more representative, but it was not till 1928 there was universal suffrage for men and women over 21.

==Rebellions, riots and unrest==

Sussex, from its position, was constantly the scene of preparations for invasion, and was often involved in rebellions.

In 1264 a group of barons led by Simon de Montfort, launched a civil war against Prince Edward, in the name of Henry III, known as the Second Barons&#x27; War. On 12 May 1264, Simon de Montfort&#x27;s forces occupied a hill known as &#x27;Offam Hill&#x27; outside Lewes. Royalist forces tried to storm the hill for over five hours but ultimately were defeated by the barons&#x27;. The actual site of what became known as the Battle of Lewes is somewhere between the town and the hill. During the 19th century, Victorian road builders constructing the Brighton-Lewes turnpike in the area of the battle discovered mass graves with around 2000 bodies in them.

During the Middle Ages the Wealden peasants rose up in revolt on two occasions, the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381 under Wat Tyler, and in Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion of 1450. Cade&#x27;s rebellion was not just supported by the peasant class, but many gentlemen, craftspeople and artisans, as well as the Abbot of Battle and Prior of Lewes, flocked to his standard in revolt against the corrupt government of Henry VI. Jack Cade was fatally wounded in a skirmish at Heathfield in 1450.

At the time of the English Civil War the county&#x27;s sympathies were divided: Arundel supported the King, while Chichester, Lewes and the Cinque Ports were for Parliament. Most of the west of the county were for the King and included a powerful group with the bishop of Chichester and Sir Edward Ford, sheriff of Sussex, in their number. Exceptionally, Chichester was for Parliament, largely due to an influential brewer named William Cawley. However the group of royalists led by Edward Ford managed to get a force together to capture Chichester in 1642 for the King and imprisoned 200 parliamentarians.

The roundhead army under Sir William Waller besieged Arundel and after its fall marched on Chichester and restored it to Parliament. A military governor, Algernon Sidney was appointed in 1645. Chichester was then demilitarised in 1647–1648 and remained in Parliament&#x27;s hands for the rest of the civil war. The brewer William Cawley became an MP for Chichester in 1647 and was one of the signatories on King Charles I&#x27;s death warrant.
At the beginning of the 19th century, agricultural labourers&#x27; conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed, while those remaining employed faced their wages being forced down. Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the House of Lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers (seasonal workers) had been found dead of starvation. The deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots in Kent during the summer of 1830. Similar action spread across the county border to Sussex where the riots lasted for several weeks, although the unrest continued until 1832 and were known as the Swing Riots.

The Swing riots were accompanied by action against local farmers and land owners. Typically, a threatening letter would be sent to a local farmer or leader demanding that automated equipment such as threshing machines should be withdrawn from service, wages should be increased and there would be a threat of consequences if this did not happen. The letter would be signed by a mythical Captain Swing. This would be followed up by the destruction of farm equipment and occasionally arson.

Eventually the army was mobilised to contain the situation in the eastern part of the county, whereas in the west the Duke of Richmond took action against the protesters by the use of the yeomanry and special constables. The Sussex Yeomanry were subsequently disparagingly nicknamed the &quot;workhouse guards&quot;. The protesters faced charges of arson, robbery, riot, machine breaking and assault. Those convicted faced imprisonment, transportation or ultimately execution. The grievances continued encouraging a wider demand for political reform, culminating in the introduction of the Reform Act 1832.

One of the main grievances of the Swing protesters had been what they saw as inadequate Poor Law benefits, Sussex had the highest poor-relief costs during the agricultural depression of 1815 to the 1830s and its workhouses were full. The general unrest, particularly about the state of the workhouses, was instrumental in the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.

==Wars==
During the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars (1793–1815), a European coalition was formed that included Britain, with the intention of crushing the newly founded French Republic. This led to defensive measures being taken in Sussex.

In 1793 at Brighton two batteries were built on the town&#x27;s east and west cliffs (replacing older installations). The Sussex Yeomanry was founded in 1794, and numbers of gentlemen and yeomen volunteered to join the part-time cavalry regiment to serve in case of invasion by Bonaparte. Between 1805 and 1808 a series of defensive towers known as Martello towers were erected along the Sussex and Kent coasts, and later on the east coast. The Admiralty commissioned a visual signalling system to allow communications between ships and the shore and from there to the Admiralty in London; Sussex had a total of 16 signalling stations on its coast. A central fort and supply base for the towers, the Eastbourne Redoubt at Eastbourne was constructed between 1804 and 1810. It is now home to the Royal Sussex Regiment Museum. In the 1860s, possible wars with France prompted more defence building, including the fort at Newhaven.

At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the landowners of the county employed their local leadership roles to recruit volunteers for the nation&#x27;s forces. The owner of Herstmonceux Castle, Claude Lowther, recruited enough men for three Southdown Battalions that were known as &quot;Lowther&#x27;s Lambs&quot;. The Royal Sussex Regiment fielded a total of 23 battalions in the Great War. After the war, St George&#x27;s Chapel, in Chichester Cathedral, was restored and furnished as a memorial to the fallen of the Royal Sussex Regiment. Nearly 7,000 of the regiment died in the First World War, and their names are recorded on the panels that are attached to the walls of the chapel.
On the Sussex boys are stirring
In the wood-land and the Downs
We are moving in the hamlet
We are rising in the town;
For the call is King and Country
Since the foe has asked for war,
And when danger calls, or duty
We are always to the fore.

With the declaration of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, Sussex found itself part of the country&#x27;s frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the Battle of Britain and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed. The first line of defence was the &quot;coastal crust&quot; consisting of pillboxes, machine-gun posts, trenches, rifle posts, anti-tank obstacles plus scaffolding, mines and barbed wire. As the Sussex regiments were serving overseas for large parts of the war, the defence of the county was undertaken by units of the Home Guard with help between 1941 and early 1944 from the First Canadian Army.

During the war every part of Sussex was affected. Army camps of both the tented and also the more permanent variety sprang up everywhere. Sussex played host to many servicemen and women, including the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, the 4th Armoured Brigade, the 30th US Division, the 27th Armoured Brigade and the 15th Scottish Division. Besides airmen and women from the British Commonwealth, fighter squadrons from the Free Belgian, Free French, Free Czechs, Free Polish were regularly based at airfields around Sussex.

During the lead-up to the D-Day landings, the people of Sussex were witness to the build-up of military personnel and materials, including the assembly of landing crafts and construction of Mulberry harbours off the county&#x27;s coast. Five new airfields were built to provide additional support for the D-Day landings, four near Chichester and one near Billingshurst.

A legacy of the D-Day landings are the sections of Mulberry harbour that lay broken and abandoned on the sea floor off the coast, of Selsey Bill, having missed the invasion.

==Economy of Sussex==
Sussex was an industrial county from the Stone Age, with the early production of flint implements until when the use of coal and steam power moved industry nearer the coalfields of the north and midlands. The county also has been known for its agriculture.

===Agriculture===
Sussex has retained much of its rural nature: apart from the coastal strip, it has few large towns. Although in 1841 over 40% of the population were employed in agriculture (including fishing), today less than 2% are so employed. The wide range of soil types in the county leads to great variations in the patterns of farming. The Wealden parts are mostly wet sticky clays or drought-prone acid sands and often broken up into small irregular fields and woods by the topography, making it unsuitable for intensive arable farming. Pastoral or mixed farming has always been the pattern here, with field boundaries often little changed since the medieval period.

Sussex cattle are the descendants of the draught oxen, which continued to be used in the Weald longer than in other parts of England. Agriculturalist Arthur Young commented in the early 18th century that the cattle of the Weald &quot;must be unquestionably ranked among the best of the kingdom.&quot; William Cobbett, riding through Ashdown Forest, said he had seen some of the finest cattle in the country on some of the poorest farms.

Areas of cereals grown on the Weald have risen and declined with the price of grain. The chalk downlands were traditionally grazed by large numbers of small Southdown sheep, suited to the low fertility of the pasture, until the coming of artificial fertiliser made cereal growing worthwhile. Yields are still limited by the alkalinity of the soil. Apart from a few areas of alluvial loam soil in the river valleys, the best and most intensively farmed soils are on the coastal plain, where large-scale vegetable growing is commonplace. Glasshouse production is also concentrated along the coast where hours of sunshine are greater than inland.

There are still fishing fleets, notably at Rye and Hastings, but the number of boats is much reduced. Historically, the fisheries were of great importance, including cod, herring, mackerel, sprats, plaice, sole, turbot, shrimps, crabs, lobsters, oysters, mussels, cockles, whelks and periwinkles. Bede records that St Wilfrid, when he visited the county in 681, taught the people the art of net-fishing. At the time of the Domesday survey, the fisheries were extensive and no fewer than 285 salinae (saltworks) existed. The customs of the Brighton fishermen were documented in 1579.

===Iron working===
Iron Age wrought iron was produced by means of a bloomery followed by reheating and hammering. With the type that was common in Sussex a round shallow hearth was dug out, clay hard-packed to line it, then layers of hammered ore and charcoal were put down and the whole lot covered by a clay &quot;beehive&quot; structure, with holes at the side for the insertion of foot or hand bellows. The material inside the &quot;beehive furnace&quot; was then ignited and it took two to three days for the process to complete, leaving semi-molten lumps of iron, known as &quot;blooms&quot; on the hearth. The output from these types of furnace was very small as everything had to cool down before the iron could be retrieved. The iron so retrieved could then be &quot;worked&quot; by using the &quot;heat and beat&quot; technique to form wrought iron implements such as weapons or tools. Around a dozen pre-Roman sites have been found in eastern Sussex, the westernmost being at Crawley.

The Romans made full use of this resource, continuing and intensifying native methods, and iron slag was widely used as paving material on the Roman roads of the area. The Roman iron industry was mainly in East Sussex with the largest sites in the Hastings area. The industry is thought to have been organised by the &quot;Classis Britannica&quot;, the Roman navy.

Little evidence has been found of iron production after the Romans left until the ninth century, when a primitive bloomery, of a continental style, was built at Millbrook on Ashdown Forest, with a small hearth for reheating the blooms nearby. Production based on bloomeries then continued until the end of the 15th century, when a new technique was imported from northern France that allowed the production of cast iron. A permanent blast furnace was constructed; into the furnace chamber was inserted a pipe fed by bellows that could be operated by a wheel; the wheel was rotated by the use of water power, oxen or horses. Pairs of bellows continuously forced air into the furnace chamber, producing higher temperatures such that the iron completely melted and could be run off from the base of the chamber and into moulds. This allowed a continuous process that usually ran during the winter and spring seasons, ceasing when water supplies to drive the bellows dwindled in the summer.

&quot;Full of iron mines it is in sundry places, where for the making and fining whereof there bee furnaces on every side, and a huge deale of wood is yearely spent...&quot;
Henry VIII urgently needed cannon for his new coastal forts, but casting these in the traditional bronze would have been very expensive. Previously iron cannons had been made by building up bands of iron bound together with iron hoops; such cannons had been used at Bannockburn in 1314. There had also been some cast cannons made in the Weald but with separate barrels and breeches.

In Buxted the local vicar, the Reverend William Levett, was also a gun-founder. He recruited a Ralf Hogge to help him produce cannon and in 1543 his employee cast an iron muzzle-loading cannon. It was cast in one piece, using a pattern based on the latest bronze ordnance. The navy complained that the new guns were too heavy but bronze was ten times more costly, so in fortifications and for arming merchant ships iron guns were preferred. Gradually, owing to their &quot;toughness and validiti&quot;, an important export trade in wealden guns built up and they remained dominant internationally until displaced by Swedish guns around 1620. Both men made a lot of money out of the trade, and Hogge built a house on the road to Levetts church. Hogge put a rebus on his house, with a hog on it as a pun for his name.

The large supply of wood in the county made it a favourable centre for the industry, all smelting being done with charcoal till the middle of the 18th century.

===Glass making===

The glass making industry started on the Sussex/Surrey border in the early 13th century and flourished until the 17th century. The industry in Sussex spread during the 16th century to Wisborough Green, then to Alfold, Ewhurst, Billingshurst and Lurgashall. Many of the artisans in the industry were immigrants from France and Germany. The manufacturing process used timber for fuel, sand and potash (which served as flux).

Glass production in the English midlands using coal for the smelting process, plus opposition to the use of timber in Sussex, led to the collapse of the Sussex glass-making industry in 1612.

===Forestry===

When the Romans arrived in Sussex around AD 43, they would have found remote bands of people smelting iron in the forest of Andresweald. Timber was used to produce charcoal to fuel the smelting process. There is evidence that the Roman engineers improved the road system in the area, by first metalling the old cart tracks and then putting in new roads. This was so they could produce and distribute the wrought iron more efficiently.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, commissioned in the 9th century by Alfred the Great, provides a description of the forest that covered the Sussex Weald. It says that the forest was wide and deep (although probably closer to wide). The forest was so dense that even the Domesday Book did not record some of its settlements.

The Weald was not the only area of Sussex that was forested in Saxon times: for example at the western end of Sussex is the Manhood Peninsula, which these days is largely deforested. The name is probably derived from the Old English &quot;maene-wudu&quot; meaning &quot;men&#x27;s wood&quot; or &quot;common wood&quot; indicating that it was once woodland.

During and before the reign of Henry VIII, England imported much of the wood for its naval ships from the Hanseatic league. Henry wanted to source the materials for his army and navy domestically. So it was largely the forests of Sussex that met this demand for wood, Sussex oak being considered the finest shipbuilding timber. Vast amounts of wood were consumed to build ships and produce charcoal for the foundry furnaces. Faced with diminishing stocks of wood due to the large consumption from the ship, iron and glass making industries, Parliament introduced bills to manage the stocks more efficiently. However the parliamentary bills were never passed, with the result that the county&#x27;s forests were decimated. The poet Michael Drayton in his poem Poly-Olbion, published in the early 17th century, made the trees denounce the iron trade:

Jove&#x27;s oak, the war-like ash, veined elm, the softer beech 
Short hazel, maple plain, light asp and bending wych 
Tough holly and smooth birch, must altogether burn. 
What should the builder serve, the forger&#x27;s turn 
When under publick good, base private gain takes hold.
And we, poor woeful woods, to ruin lastly sold.

Despite parliamentary efforts the forests of Sussex continued to be consumed. However, in 1760 Abraham Darby discovered how to replace charcoal with coke in his blast furnaces, which resulted in production being moved nearer the coal mines. By that time the forests had been completely devastated and the roads ruined by the transport of ore and pig iron.
The High Weald still has about of woodland, including areas of ancient woodland equivalent to about 7% of the stock for all England. When the &quot;Anglo Saxon Chronicle&quot; was compiled in the 9th century, there was thought to be about of forest in the Sussex Weald.

===Wool===
In 1340-1341 there were about 110,000 sheep in Sussex. Edward III commanded that his Chancellor should sit on the woolsack in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade at the time. In 1341 the greatest wool production in Sussex was in the eastern part of the county, and in the west of the county the port of Chichester was extended along the whole coast from Southampton to Seaford for the collection of customs on wool. Also Chichester, despite its geographical disadvantages ranked as the seventh port in the kingdom and was one of the wool ports named in the Statute of the Staple of 1353.

In the early 15th century, most production of wool was within of Lewes.
In the 16th century weavers were to be found in nearly every parish, as were fullers and dyers. Chichester was an early centre for the weaving of cloth and also for the spinning of linen.

In 1566 an act that prohibited the export of &quot;unwrought or unfinished cloths&quot; led to the demise of the industry in Sussex, and by the beginning of the 18th century it had virtually collapsed; Daniel Defoe commented, in 1724, that the &quot;..whole counties of Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire, are not employ&#x27;d in any considerable Woolen Manufacture;&quot;.

===Clay working (pottery, tiles, bricks)===
As much of the Mid Sussex area has clay not far under the surface, clay has in the past been a focus of industry in central Sussex, in particular in the Burgess Hill area. In the first quarter of the 20th century, Burgess Hill and the Hassocks and Hurstpierpoint areas had many kilns, clay pits and similar infrastructure to support the clay industry; nowadays the majority of this form of industry has left the area, although it still can be seen in place names such as &quot;Potters Lane&quot;, &quot;Meeds Road&quot;, &quot;The Kiln&quot;; Meeds Pottery was once a significant pottery in the centre of Burgess Hill. At the height of the success of this industry, tiles and bricks from Sussex were used to build landmarks such as Manchester&#x27;s G-Mex. In 2007 the local district council produced plans to close the only remaining tile works in the area and use the site for residential development. Then in 2015 the last tile works moved to a new home in Surrey.

==Communications==

===Roads===

After the Romans left, roads in the country fell into disrepair and in Sussex the damage was compounded by the transport of material for the iron industry. A government report described the condition of a road between Surrey and Sussex in the 17th century as &quot;very ruinous and almost impassable.&quot; In 1749 Horace Walpole wrote to a friend complaining that if he desired good roads &quot;never to go into Sussex&quot; and another writer said that the &quot;Sussex road is an almost insuperable evil&quot;. Because of the state of the county&#x27;s roads the major transport network for Sussex had been by way of sea and river, but this had become increasingly unreliable as well.

Roads had been maintained by the parishes, in a system established in 1555, a system that had proved increasingly ineffective given the relentless increase in traffic. Consequently, in 1696, during the reign of William III, the first Turnpike Act was passed and was for the repair of the highway between Reigate in Surrey and Crawley in Sussex. The act made provision to erect turnpikes, and appoint toll collectors; also to appoint surveyors, who were authorised by order of the Justices to borrow money at 5 per cent, on security of the tolls.

Other turnpike acts followed with the roads being built and maintained by local trusts and parishes. The majority of the roads were maintained by a toll levied on each passenger (who usually would have been transported by stage coach). A few roads were still maintained by the parishes with no toll levied. There were 152 Acts of Parliament by the mid-19th century for the formation, renewal and amendment of the turnpikes in the county. A report on the county&#x27;s turnpike trusts, published in 1857, said that there were fifty-one trusts covering of road, with 238 toll gates or bars, giving an average of one toll gate every .

The last turnpike to be constructed in the county was between Cripps Corner and Hawkhurst in 1841.
The system of turnpikes, coaches and coaching inns collapsed in the face of competition from the railways. By 1870 most of the county&#x27;s Turnpike Trusts were wound up, putting hundreds of coachmen and coachbuilders out of business. The conditions of the county&#x27;s roads then deteriorated until the creation of the new county council in 1889, who assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the county&#x27;s roads.

At the beginning of the 20th century, nearly all the first class roads had been turnpikes in 1850. During the course of the 20th century, the car and the lorry challenged the supremacy of the railways.

The two counties of East and West Sussex only have a total of of motorway and relatively small amounts of dual carriageway. Two of the &quot;A&quot; roads that traverse Sussex from east to west are the A27 and the A259. These two roads provide the major routes across Sussex. The route is only dual-carriageway for part of its length; both roads run parallel to the Sussex coast.

The main north–south road, which connects the coast to the London orbital M25, is the M23/A23. According to the &quot;Highways Agency&quot; the removal of most of the east/west bottlenecks, for example improvements to the Chichester bypass, will not occur for some time to come.

===Canals and navigations===

The first canals that were constructed in Sussex can be described as navigations, in that their purpose was to make the lower reaches of the county&#x27;s rivers navigable. The rivers had suffered from centuries of neglect, which had made navigation, even for small craft, difficult.

Examples of navigations in Sussex are:
* Arun Navigation
* Rother Valley Navigation

Eventually, true canals were also built, examples being:
* Wey and Arun Canal
* Portsmouth and Arundel Canal
* Hythe Military Canal

When the railways arrived in Sussex, they provided an alternative to the canals and waterways. The canal companies&#x27; revenue quickly dropped, resulting in most of them closing for business by the beginning of World War I.

===Railways===

In 1804 Richard Trevithick, a Cornish engineer, built the first steam locomotive for a railway. His seven-tonne locomotive hauled 10 tonnes of iron and 70 passengers on a journey of from the Penydarren Ironworks near Merthyr Tydfil to the Glamorganshire Canal at Abercynon, reaching a top speed of almost .

George Stephenson built the engine Locomotion for the Stockton &amp; Darlington railway, which was opened in 1825 for both passenger and goods traffic; Locomotion pulled thirty-six wagons containing coal, grain and 500 passengers a distance of at a top speed of .
The Manchester to Liverpool railway of 1830 was the first to convey passengers and goods entirely by mechanical traction. Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket, which won the famous Rainhill Trials in 1829, was the first steam locomotive designed to pull passenger traffic quickly.

Brighton&#x27;s proximity to London made it an ideal place to provide short holidays for Londoners. In the 1830s, during the summer the London-Brighton road would see around 40 coaches a day plus a number of private carriages taking visitors to the coast. The road was in a poor condition so proposals to build a railway were suggested as early as 1806. However, it was not till 1823 that a serious scheme was mooted. There followed years of discussion and argument with various groups proposing different routes; then finally in 1837 the London and Brighton Railway Bill with branches to Shoreham and Newhaven received Royal assent. In 1838 the directors of the London &amp; Brighton Railway (L&amp;BR) stated that the railway would be different from the rest of the country in that it would be a passenger-only railway.

In the 18th century Brighton had been a town in terminal decline. It was described by Daniel Defoe as &#x27;a poor fishing town, old built&#x27;, fast eaten away by an &#x27;unkind&#x27; sea. This changed after two things happened:
# In 1750 a &quot;Dr Richard Russell&quot; recommended Brighton for a seawater cure.
# From 1783 the Prince of Wales started visiting Brighton on a regular basis making it a fashionable destination.
These two events increased the number of visitors to the town. However, in 1841 when the L&amp;BR opened for business, of Brighton&#x27;s 8,137 stock of houses, some 1,095 stood empty. But within 40 years of the railway&#x27;s arrival, Brighton&#x27;s resident population had doubled.
After the opening of the Brighton line, within a few years branches were made to Chichester to the west and Hastings and Eastbourne to the east. In 1846 the L&amp;BR merged with the London &amp; Croydon Railway, the Brighton &amp; Chichester Railway and the Brighton, Lewes &amp; Hastings Railway to form the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR). The LB&amp;SCR continued as an independent entity until the Railways Act 1921, which saw the merger of various rail companies in the south and south east into the Southern Railway Company (SR); formed on 1 January 1923. Two railway companies in the county that were not absorbed by the SR, were Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway the world&#x27;s first electric railway, that runs along the front at Brighton and opened in 1883, and the West Sussex Railway, a light railway between Chichester and Selsey, opened in 1897 (and closed in 1935).

SR was the smallest of four groups that were brought together by the Railways Act 1921. The LB&amp;SCR had partly electrified their network before World War I, though that had been an overhead system. SR decided to electrify their network using the third rail DC system.
During World War II the SR was heavily involved with transporting armed services traffic and was bombed on many occasions. After the war SR was nationalised in 1948 and became the Southern Region of British Railways.

Following John Major&#x27;s victory in the 1992 General Election, the conservative government published a white paper, indicating their intention to privatise the railways. The government went ahead with their plans and franchises were awarded to train operating companies (TOC).

Most services in Sussex are operated by the Thameslink, Southern &amp; Great Northern franchise, operated by Govia Thameslink Railway since September 2014 including the Gatwick Express service between Victoria and Gatwick Airport. Southern Railway who manage the south coast and services to Victoria and London Bridge. Also Thameslink for services between Brighton and Bedford, and from Brighton to Cambridge and Horsham to Peterborough.

In September 2021, the government announced that Southeastern would take over the South Eastern franchise from Govia that operates between eastern Sussex and London.

===Ports===
The two major ports in Sussex are at Newhaven, opened in 1579, and at Shoreham opened in 1760. Other ports such as Pevensey, Winchelsea, and the original medieval port of Rye now lie stranded from the current coastline. In addition, for smaller craft, there are working harbours at Rye Harbour and Hastings, with Brighton Marina, Pagham and Chichester harbours catering for leisure craft. Other harbours that existed such as Fishbourne, Steyning, Old Shoreham, Meeching and Bulverhythe are long since silted up and have been built over.

<text>BBC News is an operational business division of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) responsible for the gathering and broadcasting of news and current affairs in the UK and around the world. The department is the world&#x27;s largest broadcast news organisation and generates about 120 hours of radio and television output each day, as well as online news coverage. The service has over 5,500 journalists working across its output including in 50 foreign news bureaus where more than 250 foreign correspondents are stationed. Deborah Turness has been the CEO of news and current affairs since September 2022.

In 2019, it was reported in an Ofcom report that the BBC spent £136m on news during the period April 2018 to March 2019. BBC News&#x27; domestic, global and online news divisions are housed within the largest live newsroom in Europe, in Broadcasting House in central London. Parliamentary coverage is produced and broadcast from studios in London. Through BBC English Regions, the BBC also has regional centres across England and national news centres in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. All nations and English regions produce their own local news programmes and other current affairs and sport programmes.

The BBC is a quasi-autonomous corporation authorised by royal charter, making it operationally independent of the government.

==History==

===Early years===

The British Broadcasting Company broadcast its first radio bulletin from radio station 2LO on 14 November 1922. Wishing to avoid competition, newspaper publishers persuaded the government to ban the BBC from broadcasting news before 7 p.m., and to force it to use wire service copy instead of reporting on its own. The BBC gradually gained the right to edit the copy and, in 1934, created its own news operation. However, it could not broadcast news before 6 p.m. until World War II. In addition to news, Gaumont British and Movietone cinema newsreels had been broadcast on the TV service since 1936, with the BBC producing its own equivalent &quot;Television Newsreel&quot; programme from January 1948. A weekly &quot;Children&#x27;s Newsreel&quot; was inaugurated on 23 April 1950, to around 350,000 receivers. The network began simulcasting its radio news on television in 1946, with a still picture of Big Ben. Televised bulletins began on 5 July 1954, broadcast from leased studios within Alexandra Palace in London.

The public&#x27;s interest in television and live events was stimulated by Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation in 1953. It is estimated that up to 27 million people viewed the programme in the UK, overtaking radio&#x27;s audience of 12 million for the first time. Those live pictures were fed from 21 cameras in central London to Alexandra Palace for transmission, and then on to other UK transmitters opened in time for the event. That year, there were around two million TV Licences held in the UK, rising to over three million the following year, and four and a half million by 1955.

===1950s===
Television news, although physically separate from its radio counterpart, was still firmly under radio news&#x27; control in the 1950s. Correspondents provided reports for both outlets, and the first televised bulletin, shown on 5 July 1954 on the then BBC television service and presented by Richard Baker, involved his providing narration off-screen while stills were shown. This was then followed by the customary &quot;Television Newsreel&quot; with a recorded commentary by John Snagge (and on other occasions by Andrew Timothy).

On-screen newsreaders were introduced a year later in 1955 Kenneth Kendall (the first to appear in vision), Robert Dougall, and Richard Baker—three weeks before ITN&#x27;s launch on 21 September 1955.

Mainstream television production had started to move out of Alexandra Palace in 1950 to larger premises mainly at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, west London taking Current Affairs (then known as Talks Department) with it. It was from here that the first &quot;Panorama&quot;, a new documentary programme, was transmitted on 11 November 1953, with Richard Dimbleby becoming anchor in 1955.

In 1958, Hugh Carleton Greene became head of News and Current Affairs.

===1960s===
On 1 January 1960, Greene became Director-General. Greene made changes that were aimed at making BBC reporting more similar to its competitor ITN, which had been highly rated by study groups held by Greene.

A newsroom was created at Alexandra Palace, television reporters were recruited and given the opportunity to write and voice their own scripts–without having to cover stories for radio too.

On 20 June 1960, Nan Winton, the first female BBC network newsreader, appeared in vision. 19 September 1960 saw the start of the radio news and current affairs programme &quot;The Ten O&#x27;clock News&quot;.

BBC2 started transmission on 20 April 1964 and began broadcasting a new show, &quot;Newsroom&quot;.

&quot;The World at One&quot;, a lunchtime news programme, began on 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, and the year before &quot;News Review&quot; had started on television. &quot;News Review&quot; was a summary of the week&#x27;s news, first broadcast on Sunday, 26 April 1964 on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly &quot;Newsreel Review of the Week&quot;, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition (&quot;super&quot;) had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news footage, committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at Alexandra Palace. The programme ran until the 1980s by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor to be superseded by Ceefax subtitling (a similar Teletext format), and the signing of such programmes as &quot;See Hear&quot; (from 1981).

On Sunday 17 September 1967, &quot;The World This Weekend&quot;, a weekly news and current affairs programme, launched on what was then Home Service, but soon-to-be Radio 4.

Preparations for colour began in the autumn of 1967 and on Thursday 7 March 1968 &quot;Newsroom&quot; on BBC2 moved to an early evening slot, becoming the first UK news programme to be transmitted in colour from Studio A at Alexandra Palace. &quot;News Review&quot; and &quot;Westminster&quot; (the latter a weekly review of Parliamentary happenings) were &quot;colourised&quot; shortly after.

However, much of the insert material was still in black and white, as initially only a part of the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour reversal film stock, and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white. Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one RCA colour Quadruplex videotape machine and, eventually two Pye plumbicon colour telecines–although the news colour service started with just one.

Black and white national bulletins on BBC 1 continued to originate from Studio B on weekdays, along with &quot;Town and Around&quot;, the London regional &quot;opt out&quot; programme broadcast throughout the 1960s (and the BBC&#x27;s first regional news programme for the South East), until it started to be replaced by &quot;Nationwide&quot; on Tuesday to Thursday from Lime Grove Studios early in September 1969. &quot;Town and Around&quot; was never to make the move to Television Centre instead it became &quot;London This Week&quot; which aired on Mondays and Fridays only, from the new TVC studios.

The BBC moved production out of Alexandra Palace in 1969. BBC Television News resumed operations the next day with a lunchtime bulletin on BBC1 in black and white from Television Centre, where it remained until March 2013.

This move to a smaller studio with better technical facilities allowed &quot;Newsroom&quot; and &quot;News Review&quot; to replace back projection with colour-separation overlay. During the 1960s, satellite communication had become possible; however, it was some years before digital line-store conversion was able to undertake the process seamlessly.

===1970s===
On 14 September 1970, the first &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; was broadcast on television. Robert Dougall presented the first week from studio N1 described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a sort of polystyrene padded cell&quot;—the bulletin having been moved from the earlier time of 20.50 as a response to the ratings achieved by ITN&#x27;s &quot;News at Ten&quot;, introduced three years earlier on the rival ITV. Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall presented subsequent weeks, thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid-1950s.

Angela Rippon became the first female news presenter of the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show&quot; in 1976 singing and dancing.

The first edition of &quot;John Craven&#x27;s Newsround&quot;, initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just &quot;Newsround&quot;, came from studio N3 on 4 April 1972.

Afternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.

Also in the mid-1970s, the late night news on BBC2 was briefly renamed &quot;Newsnight&quot;, but this was not to last, or be the same programme as we know today that would be launched in 1980 and it soon reverted to being just a news summary with the early evening BBC2 news expanded to become &quot;Newsday&quot;.

News on radio was to change in the 1970s, and on Radio 4 in particular, brought about by the arrival of new editor Peter Woon from television news and the implementation of the &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies &quot; report. These included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present, as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process. New programmes were also added to the daily schedule, &quot;PM&quot; and &quot;The World Tonight&quot; as part of the plan for the station to become a &quot;wholly speech network&quot;. &quot;Newsbeat&quot; launched as the news service on Radio 1 on 10 September 1973.

On 23 September 1974, a teletext system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.

By the end of the decade, the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining, with the introduction of ENG technology into the UK. The equipment would gradually become less cumbersome the BBC&#x27;s first attempts had been using a Philips colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable Sony U-matic recorder in the latter half of the decade.

===1980s===
In 1980, the Iranian Embassy Siege had been shot electronically by the BBC Television News Outside broadcasting team, and the work of reporter Kate Adie, broadcasting live from Prince&#x27;s Gate, was nominated for BAFTA actuality coverage, but this time beaten by ITN for the 1980 award.

&quot;Newsnight&quot;, the news and current affairs programme, was due to go on air on 23 January 1980, although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from Lime Grove was postponed by a week. On 27 August 1981 Moira Stuart became the first African Caribbean female newsreader to appear on British television.

By 1982, ENG technology had become sufficiently reliable for Bernard Hesketh to use an Ikegami camera to cover the Falklands War, coverage for which he won the &quot;Royal Television Society Cameraman of the Year&quot; award and a BAFTA nomination – the first time that BBC News had relied upon an electronic camera, rather than film, in a conflict zone. BBC News won the BAFTA for its actuality coverage, however the event has become remembered in television terms for Brian Hanrahan&#x27;s reporting where he coined the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back&quot; to circumvent restrictions, and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure.

The first BBC breakfast television programme, &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; also launched during the 1980s, on 17 January 1983 from Lime Grove Studio E and two weeks before its ITV rival TV-am. Frank Bough, Selina Scott, and Nick Ross helped to wake viewers with a relaxed style of presenting.

The &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; first aired on 3 September 1984, eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the UK (however, since 2006 it has been overtaken by the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;). In October 1984, images of millions of people starving to death in the Ethiopian famine were shown in Michael Buerk&#x27;s &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; reports. The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk&#x27;s report on 23 October describing it as &quot;a biblical famine in the 20th century&quot; and &quot;the closest thing to hell on Earth&quot;. The BBC News report shocked Britain, motivating its citizens to inundate relief agencies, such as Save the Children, with donations, and to bring global attention to the crisis in Ethiopia. The news report was also watched by Bob Geldof, who would organise the charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; to raise money for famine relief followed by the Live Aid concert in July 1985.

Starting in 1981, the BBC gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles–a set of computer-animated &quot;stripes&quot; forming a circle on a red background with a &quot;BBC News&quot; typescript appearing below the circle graphics, and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards. The &quot;Nine&quot; used a similar (striped) number 9. The red background was replaced by a blue from 1985 until 1987.

By 1987, the BBC had decided to re-brand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music, the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the &quot;Nine&quot;, although the &quot;stripes&quot; introduction continued to be used until 1989 on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule.

In 1987, John Birt resurrected the practice of correspondents working for both TV and radio with the introduction of bi-media journalism.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, a wider range of services began to be offered by BBC News, with the split of BBC World Service Television to become BBC World (news and current affairs), and BBC Prime (light entertainment). Content for a 24-hour news channel was thus required, followed in 1997 with the launch of domestic equivalent BBC News 24. Rather than set bulletins, ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary. In 1998, after 66 years at Broadcasting House, the BBC Radio News operation moved to BBC Television Centre.

New technology, provided by Silicon Graphics, came into use in 1993 for a re-launch of the main BBC 1 bulletins, creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically. The relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring, titles, and music to differentiate each. A computer generated cut-glass sculpture of the BBC coat of arms was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in 1999.

In November 1997, BBC News Online was launched, following individual webpages for major news events such as the 1996 Olympic Games, 1997 general election, and the death of Princess Diana.

In 1999, the biggest relaunch occurred, with BBC One bulletins, BBC World, BBC News 24, and BBC News Online all adopting a common style. One of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the BBC regional news programmes, giving a common style across local, national and international BBC television news. This also included &quot;Newyddion&quot;, the main news programme of Welsh language channel S4C, produced by BBC News Wales.

===2000s===
Following the relaunch of BBC News in 1999, regional headlines were included at the start of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000. The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55. 2000 also saw the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; moved to the later time of 22:00. This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular &quot;News at Ten&quot; programme to 23:00. ITN briefly returned &quot;News at Ten&quot; but following poor ratings when head-to-head against the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008.

The retirement in 2009 of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; led to changes in the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the &quot;Ten&quot;. A new set design featuring a projected fictional newsroom backdrop was introduced, followed on 16 February 2004 by new programme titles to match those of BBC News 24.

BBC News 24 and BBC World introduced a new style of presentation in December 2003, that was slightly altered on 5 July 2004 to mark 50 years of BBC Television News. The individual positions of editor of the &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while Craig Oliver was later named editor of the &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. The bulletins also began to be simulcast with News 24, as a way of pooling resources.

Bulletins received new titles and a new set design in May 2006, to allow for &quot;Breakfast&quot; to move into the main studio for the first time since 1997. The new set featured Barco videowall screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for &quot;Breakfast&quot;. This was later replaced following viewer criticism. The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced ITV News in 2004, though ITN uses a CSO Virtual studio rather than the actual screens at BBC News. Also, May saw the launch of &quot;World News Today&quot; the first domestic bulletin focused principally on international news.

BBC News became part of a new BBC Journalism group in November 2006 as part of a restructuring of the BBC. The then-Director of BBC News, Helen Boaden reported to the then-Deputy Director-General and head of the journalism group, Mark Byford until he was made redundant in 2010.

On 18 October 2007, Mark Thompson announced a six-year plan, &quot;Delivering Creative Future&quot;, merging the television current affairs department into a new &quot;News Programmes&quot; division. Thompson&#x27;s announcement, in response to a £2 billion shortfall in funding, would, he said, deliver &quot;a smaller but fitter BBC&quot; in the digital age, by cutting its payroll and, in 2013, selling Television Centre.

The various separate newsrooms for television, radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom. Programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department. BBC World Service director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would be fewer ways to broadcast them.

A new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in January 2007. This coincided with a new structure to BBC World News bulletins, editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on.

The first new BBC News bulletin since the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; was announced in July 2007 following a successful trial in the Midlands. The summary, lasting 90 seconds, has been broadcast at 20:00 on weekdays since December 2007 and bears similarities with &quot;60 Seconds&quot; on BBC Three, but also includes headlines from the various BBC regions and a weather summary.

As part of a long-term cost cutting programme, bulletins were renamed the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;, &quot;Six&quot; and &quot;Ten&quot; respectively in April 2008 while BBC News 24 was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre. BBC World was renamed &quot;BBC World News&quot; and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style, designed by Lambie-Nairn.

2008 also saw tri-media introduced across TV, radio, and online.

The studio moves also meant that Studio N9, previously used for BBC World, was closed, and operations moved to the previous studio of BBC News 24. Studio N9 was later refitted to match the new branding, and was used for the BBC&#x27;s UK local elections and European elections coverage in early June 2009.

===2010s===
A strategy review of the BBC in March 2010, confirmed that having &quot;the best journalism in the world&quot; would form one of five key editorial policies, as part of changes subject to public consultation and BBC Trust approval.

After a period of suspension in late 2012, Helen Boaden ceased to be the Director of BBC News. On 16 April 2013, incoming BBC Director-General Tony Hall named James Harding, a former editor of &quot;The Times&quot; of London newspaper as Director of News and Current Affairs.

From August 2012 to March 2013, all news operations moved from Television Centre to new facilities in the refurbished and extended Broadcasting House, in Portland Place. The move began in October 2012, and also included the BBC World Service, which moved from Bush House following the expiry of the BBC&#x27;s lease. This new extension to the north and east, referred to as &quot;New Broadcasting House&quot;, includes several new state-of-the-art radio and television studios centred around an 11-storey atrium. The move began with the domestic programme &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; on 2 September 2012, and concluded with the move of the BBC News channel and domestic news bulletins on 18 March 2013. The newsroom houses all domestic bulletins and programmes on both television and radio, as well as the BBC World Service international radio networks and the BBC World News international television channel.

BBC News and CBS News established an editorial and newsgathering partnership in 2017, replacing an earlier long-standing partnership between BBC News and ABC News.

In an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of 38 news organizations, BBC News was ranked the fourth most trusted news organization by Americans, behind CBS News, ABC News and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

===2020s===

In January 2020 the BBC announced a BBC News savings target of £80 million per year by 2022, involving about 450 staff reductions from the current 6,000. BBC director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth said there would be further moves toward digital broadcasting, in part to attract back a youth audience, and more pooling of reporters to stop separate teams covering the same news. A further 70 staff reductions were announced in July 2020.

BBC Three began airing the news programme &quot;The Catch Up&quot; in February 2022. It is presented by Levi Jouavel, Kirsty Grant, and Callum Tulley and aims to get the channel&#x27;s target audience (16 to 34 year olds) to make sense of the world around them whilst also highlighting optimistic stories. Compared to its predecessor &quot;60 Seconds&quot;, &quot;The Catch Up&quot; is three times longer and runs for about three minutes and doesn&#x27;t air at weekends.

According to its annual report , India has the largest number of people using BBC services in the world.

==Programming and reporting==
In November 2023, BBC News joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the &#x27;Cyprus Confidential&#x27; report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation&#x27;s findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.

===Television===
BBC News is responsible for the news programmes and documentary content on the BBC&#x27;s general television channels, as well as the news coverage on the BBC News Channel in the UK, and 22 hours of programming for the corporation&#x27;s international BBC World News channel. Coverage for BBC Parliament is carried out on behalf of the BBC at Millbank Studios, though BBC News provides editorial and journalistic content. BBC News content is also output onto the BBC&#x27;s digital interactive television services under the BBC Red Button brand, and until 2012, on the Ceefax teletext system.

The music on all BBC television news programmes was introduced in 1999 and composed by David Lowe. It was part of the re-branding which commenced in 1999 and features &#x27;BBC Pips&#x27;. The general theme was used on bulletins on BBC One, News 24, BBC World and local news programmes in the BBC&#x27;s Nations and Regions. Lowe was also responsible for the music on Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Newsbeat&quot;. The theme has had several changes since 1999, the latest in March 2013.

The BBC Arabic Television news channel launched on 11 March 2008, a Persian-language channel followed on 14 January 2009, broadcasting from the Peel wing of Broadcasting House; both include news, analysis, interviews, sports and highly cultural programmes and are run by the BBC World Service and funded from a grant-in-aid from the British Foreign Office (and not the television licence).

===Radio===
BBC Radio News produces bulletins for the BBC&#x27;s national radio stations and provides content for local BBC radio stations via the General News Service (GNS), a BBC-internal news distribution service. BBC News does not produce the BBC&#x27;s regional news bulletins, which are produced individually by the BBC nations and regions themselves. The BBC World Service broadcasts to some 150 million people in English as well as 27 languages across the globe. BBC Radio News is a patron of the Radio Academy.

===Online===

BBC News Online is the BBC&#x27;s news website. Launched in November 1997, it is one of the most popular news websites, with 1.2 billion website visits in April 2021, as well as being used by 60% of the UK&#x27;s internet users for news. The website contains international news coverage as well as entertainment, sport, science, and political news.

Mobile apps for Android, iOS and Windows Phone systems have been provided since 2010. Many television and radio programmes are also available to view on the BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds services. The BBC News channel is also available to view 24 hours a day, while video and radio clips are also available within online news articles.

In October 2019, BBC News Online launched a mirror on the dark web anonymity network Tor in an effort to circumvent censorship.

==Criticism==
===Political and commercial independence===
The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners. This political objectivity is sometimes questioned. For instance, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (3 August 2005) carried a letter from the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky, referring to it as &quot;The Red Service&quot;. Books have been written on the subject, including anti-BBC works like &quot;Truth Betrayed&quot; by W J West and &quot;The Truth Twisters&quot; by Richard Deacon. The BBC has been accused of bias by Conservative MPs.

The BBC&#x27;s Editorial Guidelines on Politics and Public Policy state that whilst &quot;the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged&quot;, &quot;the government of the day will often be the primary source of news&quot;.

The BBC is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and, by the opposition, of bias in favour of the government. Similarly, during times of war, the BBC is often accused by the UK government, or by strong supporters of British military campaigns, of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy. An edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot; at the start of the Falklands War in 1982 was described as &quot;almost treasonable&quot; by John Page, MP, who objected to Peter Snow saying &quot;if we believe the British&quot;.

During the first Gulf War, critics of the BBC took to using the satirical name &quot;Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation&quot;. During the Kosovo War, the BBC were labelled the &quot;Belgrade Broadcasting Corporation&quot; (suggesting favouritism towards the FR Yugoslavia government over ethnic Albanian rebels) by British ministers, although Slobodan Milosević (then FRY president) claimed that the BBC&#x27;s coverage had been biased &quot;against&quot; his nation.

Conversely, some of those who style themselves anti-establishment in the United Kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the BBC of pro-establishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to &quot;anti-war&quot; voices. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a study by the Cardiff University School of Journalism of the reporting of the war found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them, and only one in 10 questioned this assumption. It also found that, out of the main British broadcasters covering the war, the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source. It was also the least likely to use independent sources, like the Red Cross, who were more critical of the war. When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties, the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels. The report&#x27;s author, Justin Lewis, wrote &quot;Far from revealing an anti-war BBC, our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage. Either way, it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti-war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis.&quot;

Prominent BBC appointments are constantly assessed by the British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of Greg Dyke as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, as well as a friend of Tony Blair. The BBC&#x27;s former Political Editor, Nick Robinson, was some years ago a chairman of the Young Conservatives and did, as a result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor Andrew Marr faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000.

Mark Thompson, former Director-General of the BBC, admitted the organisation has been biased &quot;towards the left&quot; in the past. He said, &quot;In the BBC I joined 30 years ago, there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people&#x27;s personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left&quot;. He then added, &quot;The organization did struggle then with impartiality. Now it is a completely different generation. There is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the BBC.&quot;

Following the EU referendum in 2016, some critics suggested that the BBC was biased in favour of leaving the EU. For instance, in 2018, the BBC received complaints from people who took issue that the BBC was not sufficiently covering anti-Brexit marches whilst giving smaller-scale events hosted by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage more airtime. On the other hand, a poll released by YouGov showed that 45% of people who voted to leave the EU thought that the BBC was &#x27;actively anti-Brexit&#x27; compared to 13% of the same kinds of voters who think the BBC is pro-Brexit.

===India===
In 2008, the BBC Hindi was criticised by some Indian outlets for referring to the terrorists who carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks as &quot;gunmen&quot;. The response to this added to prior criticism from some Indian commentators suggesting that the BBC may have an Indophobic bias. In March 2015, the BBC was criticised for a BBC &quot;Storyville&quot; documentary interviewing one of the rapists in India. In spite of a ban ordered by the Indian High court, the BBC still aired the documentary &quot;India&#x27;s Daughter&quot; outside India.

===Hutton Inquiry===
BBC News was at the centre of a political controversy following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Three BBC News reports (Andrew Gilligan&#x27;s on &quot;Today&quot;, Gavin Hewitt&#x27;s on &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and another on &quot;Newsnight&quot;) quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government (particularly the Prime Minister&#x27;s office) had embellished the September Dossier with misleading exaggerations of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction capabilities. The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism.

In subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report, saying that it had a reliable source. Following intense media speculation, David Kelly was named in the press as the source for Gilligan&#x27;s story on 9 July 2003. Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by Lord Hutton was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly&#x27;s death, concluding that &quot;Dr. Kelly took his own life.&quot;

In his report on 28 January 2004, Lord Hutton concluded that Gilligan&#x27;s original accusation was &quot;unfounded&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s editorial and management processes were &quot;defective&quot;. In particular, it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story. The BBC Director of News, Richard Sambrook, the report said, had accepted Gilligan&#x27;s word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete. Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place. The Board of Governors, under the chairman&#x27;s, Gavyn Davies, guidance, accepted that further investigation of the Government&#x27;s complaints were unnecessary.

Because of the criticism in the Hutton report, Davies resigned on the day of publication. BBC News faced an important test, reporting on itself with the publication of the report, but by common consent (of the Board of Governors) managed this &quot;independently, impartially and honestly&quot;. Davies&#x27; resignation was followed by the resignation of Director General, Greg Dyke, the following day, and the resignation of Gilligan on 30 January. While undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation, an ICM poll in April 2003 indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===

The BBC has faced accusations of holding both anti-Israel and anti-Palestine bias.

Douglas Davis, the London correspondent of &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, has described the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict as &quot;a relentless, one-dimensional portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors [which] bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that, wittingly or not, has the effect of delegitimising the Jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old European hatred that dared not speak its name for the past half-century.&quot;. However two large independent studies, one conducted by Loughborough University and the other by Glasgow University&#x27;s Media Group concluded that Israeli perspectives are given greater coverage.

Critics of the BBC argue that the Balen Report proves systematic bias against Israel in headline news programming. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; criticised the BBC for spending hundreds of thousands of British tax payers&#x27; pounds from preventing the report being released to the public.

Jeremy Bowen, the Middle East Editor for BBC world news, was singled out specifically for bias by the BBC Trust which concluded that he violated &quot;BBC guidelines on accuracy and impartiality.&quot;

An independent panel appointed by the BBC Trust was set up in 2006 to review the impartiality of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The panel&#x27;s assessment was that &quot;apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias.&quot; While noting a &quot;commitment to be fair accurate and impartial&quot; and praising much of the BBC&#x27;s coverage the independent panel concluded &quot;that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict. In some ways the picture is incomplete and, in that sense, misleading.&quot; It notes that, &quot;the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, [reflects] the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation&quot;.

Writing in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Philip Stephens, one of the panellists, later accused the BBC&#x27;s director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel&#x27;s conclusions. He further opined &quot;My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron-clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process. If I am right, the BBC, too, is lost&quot;. Mark Thompson published a rebuttal in the FT the next day.

The description by one BBC correspondent reporting on the funeral of Yassir Arafat that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality, particularly from Martin Walker in a guest opinion piece in &quot;The Times&quot;, who picked out the apparent case of Fayad Abu Shamala, the BBC Arabic Service correspondent, who told a Hamas rally on 6 May 2001, that journalists in Gaza were &quot;waging the campaign shoulder to shoulder together with the Palestinian people&quot;.

Walker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons. Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Ariel Sharon&#x27;s stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual. Furthermore, he wrote, the inquiry only looked at the BBC&#x27;s domestic coverage, and excluded output on the BBC World Service and BBC World.

Tom Gross accused the BBC of glorifying Hamas suicide bombers, and condemned its policy of inviting guests such as Jenny Tonge and Tom Paulin who have compared Israeli soldiers to Nazis. Writing for the BBC, Paulin said Israeli soldiers should be &quot;shot dead&quot; like Hitler&#x27;s S.S, and said he could &quot;understand how suicide bombers feel&quot;.

The BBC also faced criticism for not airing a Disasters Emergency Committee aid appeal for Palestinians who suffered in Gaza during 22-day war there between late 2008 and early 2009. Most other major UK broadcasters did air this appeal, but rival Sky News did not.

British journalist Julie Burchill has accused BBC of creating a &quot;climate of fear&quot; for British Jews over its &quot;excessive coverage&quot; of Israel compared to other nations.

In light of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the BBC suspended seven Arab journalists over allegations of expressing support for Hamas via social media.

===Partners===
BBC and ABC share video segments and reporters as needed in producing their newscasts. with the BBC showing &quot;ABC World News Tonight with David Muir&quot; in the UK. However, in July 2017, the BBC announced a new partnership with CBS News allows both organisations to share video, editorial content, and additional newsgathering resources in New York, London, Washington and around the world.

BBC News subscribes to wire services from leading international agencies including PA Media (formerly Press Association), Reuters, and Agence France-Presse. In April 2017, the BBC dropped Associated Press in favour of an enhanced service from AFP.

===The view of foreign governments===
BBC News reporters and broadcasts are now and have in the past been banned in several countries primarily for reporting which has been unfavourable to the ruling government. For example, correspondents were banned by the former apartheid régime of South Africa. The BBC was banned in Zimbabwe under Mugabe for eight years as a terrorist organisation until being allowed to operate again over a year after the 2008 elections.

The BBC was banned in Burma (officially Myanmar) after their coverage and commentary on anti-government protests there in September 2007. The ban was lifted four years later in September 2011. Other cases have included Uzbekistan,
China, and Pakistan. BBC Persian, the BBC&#x27;s Persian language news site, was blocked from the Iranian internet in 2006. The BBC News website was made available in China again in March 2008, but , was blocked again.

In June 2015, the Rwandan government placed an indefinite ban on BBC broadcasts following the airing of a controversial documentary regarding the 1994 Rwandan genocide, &quot;Rwanda&#x27;s Untold Story&quot;, broadcast on BBC2 on 1 October 2014. The UK&#x27;s Foreign Office recognised &quot;the hurt caused in Rwanda by some parts of the documentary&quot;.

In February 2017, reporters from the BBC (as well as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Politico, CNN, and others) were denied access to a United States White House briefing.

In 2017, BBC India was banned for a period of 5 years from covering all national parks and sanctuaries in India. Following the withdrawal of CGTN&#x27;s UK broadcaster licence on 4 February 2021 by Ofcom, China banned BBC News from airing in China.

<text>The Buick LeSabre is a full-size car made by the division Buick of General Motors from 1959 until 2005. Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size Buick Special model (1936–58). The &quot;LeSabre&quot;, which is French for &quot;the sabre&quot;, was Buick&#x27;s mid-level full-size sedan above the Special but below the Electra during the 1960s then remained in its market position when the Electra was replaced with the Park Avenue. The LeSabre was available as a 2-door convertible, sedan or hardtop, a 4-door sedan or hardtop and station wagon throughout its production.

==History of model==
The LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 Le Sabre show car, which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the Buick Special. The Buick LeSabre was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965 and 1969 when its station wagon variant was dropped from Buick&#x27;s full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.

In addition to being Buick&#x27;s entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick&#x27;s best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.
From 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch V8, which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at in standard form with an &quot;economy&quot; version offered as a &quot;no cost&quot; option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at . For 1962–63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at , or a no-cost &quot;economy&quot; low-compression version rated at . Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models&#x27; smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964–65), 340 (1966–67) and 350 (1968–76). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick&#x27;s 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.

For most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed Super Turbine 300 and the three-speed Super Turbine 400. A four-speed manual transmission was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line&#x27;s demise after 2005.

LeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived Roadmaster series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.

==First generation (1959–1960)==

LeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation&#x27;s full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959–60). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chrome square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and &quot;Delta-wing&quot; fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level Invicta and the top model Electra.

While Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick&#x27;s new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed &quot;Triple Turbine&quot; Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.
The 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick&#x27;s then-new &quot;Tri-Shield&quot; logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome &quot;VentiPort&quot; portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957. LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were &quot;four-holers&quot;. Inside, a revised instrument panel featured &quot;Mirromatic&quot;, where the speedometer, odometer and any warning light indicators are reflected from an adjustable tilt mirror inside the dashboard for comfortable viewing that would reduce unwanted glare and reflection. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.
==Second generation (1961–1964)==

LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design. Inside were revised instrument panels retaining the &quot;Mirrormatic&quot; speedometer and new upholstery trims.

The Estate station wagons received a &quot;Cordaveen&quot; vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/Cordaveen combination interior available as an option. Engines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available. The Ventiports returned to the side of the front fender denoting the entry-level status in Buick&#x27;s hierarchy of products offered.

The 1962 Buick LeSabre was only moderately changed from the previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and taillights. Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows. Under the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based Wildcat coupe. Inside, interiors were mildly revised with the &quot;Mirrormatic&quot; speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.
The 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans. Inside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control. The same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.
Minor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963&#x27;s vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped &quot;Custom&quot; version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body. Under the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models. Replacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed manual was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter. Inside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.
==Third generation (1965–1970)==
LeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at , but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the &quot;X&quot; frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based Buick Sport Wagon which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser. Starting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two trim levels, the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.

Interiors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963–64 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls. Drivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 210-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre &quot;400&quot; package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine &quot;400&quot; three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick&#x27;s higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models. Buick&#x27;s engine–transmission practice was similar to that of GM&#x27;s Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered the two-speed Powerglide automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM&#x27;s medium-priced competitors such as the Chrysler Newport and Mercury Monterey, which offered the TorqueFlite and Cruise-O-Matic transmissions, respectively.
New grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights. Under the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.
Somewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued. New options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced. Engine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.
The 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models. A new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The &quot;LeSabre 400&quot; option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The &quot;Switch-Pitch&quot; torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.
The 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at . Interiors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped. Also new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick&#x27;s tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars. Powertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed manual transmission or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic while the LeSabre &quot;400&quot; package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.
Only minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to , matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport. Both base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick&#x27;s new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel. Transmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the &quot;Super Turbine&quot; designation used since 1964. At the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option. For the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the Estate Wagon nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre&#x27;s B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225&#x27;s wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat. The 1965-70 GM B platform is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T and the Lada Riva.
==Fourth generation (1971–1976)==
Like the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.
The same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the Turbo Hydramatic transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate&#x27;s final year in 2005. The new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for &#x27;71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn&#x27;t work. However, within weeks of the 1971 models&#x27; debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972. Also new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system. Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969–70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a &quot;455&quot; badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the &quot;Custom&quot; badge normally used.
A revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small &quot;BUICK&quot; nameplate was located above the right-side taillight, replacing the larger block letters spelling &quot;B U I C K&quot; across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for &#x27;72 was a one-year only -mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for 1972. Interior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a dynamometer rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973. Inside, the instrument panel featured a new &quot;FASTEN SEAT BELTS&quot; light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.
The 1973 Buick LeSabre featured the larger federally mandated &quot;5 mph&quot; front bumper and a new vertical bar grille flowed across the entire lower front end and under the headlights, and turn signal below the bumper. Revised taillights were set in a larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars. The LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived Centurion as Buick&#x27;s only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.
The 1974 Buick LeSabre appeared to have a stronger, more modern appearance with a more detailed vertical-barred grille, dual headlights were given individual bezels, turn signals were set within the front bumper and wide horizontal taillights stretched above the new 5 mph rear bumper. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows (along with a small roll-down rear window). Inside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an &quot;Air Cushion Restraint System&quot; which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year. New integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it. With the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick&#x27;s only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick&#x27;s only ragtop. Engine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 &quot;performance package&quot; which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment. New options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM&#x27;s High Energy Ignition and a &quot;low fuel&quot; warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.
The upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM&#x27;s Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines. Engine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel. The 1975 Buick LeSabre now featured a larger, cross-hatched patterned grille which still ran the entire front of the car, dual headlights were once again set side by side instead of individually. Turn signals were located within the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole &#x27;ventiports&#x27; were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger but narrower taillamps draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window &quot;Colonnade&quot; styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows. Inside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100 mph compared to 120 mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions. Convertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles&#x27; overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the &#x27;scissor top&#x27; that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.

Only minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes included rectangular quad headlights placed into a unit with the turn signals set directly below and at the center was a new classic eggcrate grille, no longer integrated with the headlights, making it more prominent. The 1976 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick&#x27;s brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the V6 engine was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre. Unlike the full size Chevrolet and other competing big coupes, Buick&#x27;s full size LeSabre coupe was a true hardtop, with small rear quarter windows that rolled down (in addition to a larger third rear side &quot;opera window&quot; that was fixed). Pontiac and Oldsmobile also offered the hardtop coupe in their lower-priced lines. 1976 was the last year for all GM pillarless body styles.

To commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States, the standard colors available on all Buicks were Judicial Black, Liberty White, Pewter Gray, Potomac Blue, Continental Blue, Concord Green, Constitution Green, Mount Vernon Cream, Buckskin Tan, Musket Brown, Boston Red and Independence Red, with specially available colors on select models Congressional Cream, Revere Red, Colonial Yellow and Firecracker Orange.

==Fifth generation (1977–1985)==

The 1977 Buick LeSabre and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller on the outside and lighter than their predecessors, losing 700-800 pounds of weight and of overall length. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a &quot;corporate-wide&quot; downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years. Although the 1977 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built V6 and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon. The pillarless hardtop body styles were no longer available.
Following a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285 lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.
Only minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.
New sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick&#x27;s traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977–79 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little. Engine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera. Following the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM&#x27;s emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.
Only minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings. Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000 lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM&#x27;s &quot;Computer Command Control&quot; system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls. The three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy. LeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.
Few changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.

A new front clip that largely resembled the Electra and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The wagon model was dropped for one year in 1984, before returning in 1985. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).

1985 would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick&#x27;s traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992–96 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged as a LeSabre or an Electra through 1990.

==Sixth generation (1986–1991)==
For 1986, Buick introduced the sixth generation LeSabre, using GM&#x27;s newly developed front wheel drive H platform shared with the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and 1987 Pontiac Bonneville — a platform in most respects identical to the front-drive GM C platform. The LeSabre featured a front-hinged clamshell engine hood, shared with the Buick Electra and flush, aerodynamic styling — but without Buick&#x27;s hallmark ventiports or sweepspear.
Most Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick&#x27;s 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine. It started out with . It added balance shafts to become the famous &quot;3800&quot; V6 for 1988, with . This engine increased to in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection. The 1986 model featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard. The sixth generation featured Dynaride, four wheel independent suspension, as well as automatic load leveling, which used an air compressor to pressurize the rear Chapman Struts to maintain level ride height — and was not available on vehicles equipped with Gran Touring Suspension. Each year received slight design changes.

1986: At its inception, the LeSabre featured sealed-beam headlights. Exclusively for 1986, Buick offered the LeSabre Grand National model to homologate the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. Fewer than 120 were made. The Grand National featured a black exterior with gray interior.

1987: 1987 models received composite headlamps with exchangeable bulbs. In compliance with U.S. passive restraint standards, front seat-belts were door-mounted for the front outboard positions and three-point at the rear outboard positions — for coupe models with the start of 1987 production (September 1986) and for sedans beginning with December 1986 production.

Superseding the 1986 Grand National, for 1987 Buick introduced the LeSabre T-Type (1987-1989). The packaged included featuring 15” aluminum wheels, blackwall tires, heavy duty engine and transmission cooling, revised suspension (marketed as &quot;Gran Touring&quot;), 2.97 Final Drive Ratio, leather wrapped steering wheel and shift handle, tilt steering column, wipers with delay feature, electronic cruise control, red an amber tail lamps, dual exhaust outlets, black trim (side, belt, roof drip, wheel openings, tail lamps, door handles, lock cylinders and grille), flush hood ornament, black cloth 45/45 Seats, carpet savers, T-Type identification, rear deck spoiler, front air dam, stereo radio (with graphic equalizer, cassette tape and red backlighting),console with red backlighting, black trimmed operation controls (e.g., heating, air conditioning and steering column), analog gauge cluster(with red backlighting, voltmeter, oil pressure, tachometer and coolant temperature gage. Available exterior colors included silver, white, black and red.

1988: For 1988, the optional 3.8 engine was replaced with the much-modified, balance shaft-equipped LN3 3800 (vin code C, aka pre-series I 3800).

1989: In the engine bay, 1989 models received revised positions for the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank.

1990: 1990 models received a revised tail light design and front bumper/grille, where the center grill element dropped slightly relative to the outboard grill elements. For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped.

1991: 1991 models were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase. 
Beginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, J.D. Power noted the LeSabre received as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.

==Seventh generation (1992–1999)==
This LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year&#x27;s Park Avenue. The two-door coupe was dropped, leaving only a four-door sedan from this point forward. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM&#x27;s plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders. The hood was now conventionally hinged from the rear, abandoning the previous generation&#x27;s front-hinged design.

The LeSabre&#x27;s engine from 1992 to 1995 was the 3800 V6 (L27), which produced and 225 lb·ft (305 N·m) The car got 18 mpg (13.1 L/100 km) in the city and 28 mpg (8.4 L/100 km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at . Top speed was electronically limited to .

This generation saw the installation of Gran Touring Suspension, which included an air compressor that would pressurize the rear Chapman struts to maintain a level overall ride height, along with a slightly lower 3.08:1 final drive ratio (as opposed to the standard 2.93:1). A badge was installed on the dashboard to the left of the steering column on all vehicles equipped. It was not available on vehicles equipped with Dynaride.

The LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk. The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, Anti-lock brakes, and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator. Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.

In 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick&#x27;s 90th anniversary. In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included &quot;90th Anniversary&quot; badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver&#x27;s seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.

For 1996, the LeSabre received the 3800 Series II powerplant, with a gain of . The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19 MPG city and 30 MPG highway United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates.

===1997 facelift===
Buick facelifted the LeSabre for MY1997, relocating the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly, providing a revised gauge cluster with a tachometer, using galvanized steel fenders (rather than composite), as well as revising the grille, rear backup lights and trim.

In 1999, Flint, Michigan&#x27;s Buick City assembly plant, which manufactured the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville ceased operations and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck. The last 1999 LeSabre left Buick City&#x27;s final line, becoming also the last Buick City-manufactured car — in June 1999.

Production Figures:


==Eighth generation (2000–2005)==

The eighth generation LeSabre was introduced in March 1999 using the GM&#x27;s G platform; which GM continued to call the H platform. The LeSabre was manufactured at GM&#x27;s Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly factory in Hamtramck, Michigan, and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan.

Despite its slightly narrower exterior dimensions, the eighth generation offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the outgoing generation, and featured a cabin filter accessed from passenger side of the engine compartment, against the firewall. Trim levels again included Custom and Limited. Changes included a new grille no longer integral with the hood.

In 2003, a Celebration Edition package recognizing Buick&#x27;s centennial added to the Limited trim pearlescent with either White Diamond or Crimson Pearl tricoat paint schemes, a blacked-out grille, 16-inch chrome wheels, and special badging. Though created to commemorate Buick&#x27;s centennial in 2003, the package remained available in 2004 and 2005. Other features optional or standard on the LeSabre included Stabilitrak, OnStar, EyeCue heads-up display, all-weather traction control, automatic load-leveling, side airbags, tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, and automatic windshield wipers marketed as &quot;RainSense&quot;.

A Platinum Edition package could be added to the 2004 Custom trim level.

The standard, and only available, engine for the eighth-generation LeSabre was the 3.8 L Series II Buick 3800 V6 providing:
* Power: 
* Torque: 230 lb·ft (312 N·m)

==Discontinuation==
The LeSabre was North America&#x27;s best-selling full-size car when it was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model year. It was replaced in 2006 by the Lucerne, Buick&#x27;s newly designed flagship. The last LeSabre rolled off the Lake Orion, Michigan, assembly line on June 18, 2004 (retooling the plant to build the Pontiac G6) and the last Hamtramck, Michigan LeSabre (And the last LeSabre to ever be built) rolled off the assembly line on August 24, 2005.

<text>John Lennon Anthology is a four-CD box set of home demos, studio outtakes and other previously unreleased material recorded by John Lennon over the course of his solo career from &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; in 1969 up until the 1980 sessions for &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;.

The anthology was divided by its compiler and co-producer, Yoko Ono, into four discs representing four eras in Lennon&#x27;s solo career: &quot;Ascot&quot;, &quot;New York City&quot;, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; and &quot;Dakota&quot;.

&quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot; reached number 62 in the United Kingdom and number 99 in the United States, where it went gold.

A one-disc distillation of the highlights of the box set was released as Wonsaponatime. Many of the tracks were edited down from their versions on &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;. &quot;Wonsaponatime&quot; failed to reach the US charts but peaked at number 76 in the UK.

<doc id="1139904" wikidata="Q17035052" url="?curid=1139904" title="Transaction deposit">
<text>In the United States, transaction deposit is a term used by the Federal Reserve for checkable deposits and other accounts that can be used directly as cash without withdrawal limits or restrictions. Such demand deposits are subject to reserve requirements imposed by the central bank that require the bank to keep reserves at the central bank. This is in contrast to &quot;time deposits&quot; ( term deposits), which are not subject to reserve requirements.

==Regulations==
Transaction accounts include all deposits against which the account holder is permitted to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments, payment orders of withdrawal, or by telephone or preauthorized transfers for the purpose of making payments to third persons or others. However, accounts subject to the rules that permit no more than six preauthorized, automatic, or other transfers per month (of which no more than three may be by check, draft, debit card, or similar order payable directly to third parties) are savings deposits, not transaction accounts.

<text>Capriate San Gervasio (Bergamasque: ; Milanese: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, northern Italy. , its population was 8,216.

The municipality is located about from Milan.

==History==
About two thousand years ago, the Romans founded settlements in the area, together with the previous Celtic ones.

The first document attesting the existence of the village dates back to 948; the land had been exploited by the Bishop of Cremona, who had received the feudal investiture from the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

During the following centuries the city witnessed a number of conflicts between the opposing factions of Guelphs and Ghibellines. The situation induced the construction of buildings useful for defense, such as a castle. Also, towards the end of the 12th century, the troops of Bergamo built a huge fortification used as a weapons deposit.

The village was involved in punitive expeditions led by Facino Cane and Francesco Bussone, culminating with the destruction of the bridge over the Adda.

Numerous battles affected the population, who were also subjected to the battles between the troops of Milan and the troops of Venice. The troops of Milan were led by the Sforza-Visconti family and they initially prevailed.

The Venetian recaptured the control of the area in the XV century, ensuring political stability for many years.

In 1797, French rule began with the Cisalpine Republic, and afterwards the Austrians came and constituted the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.

In 1899 in the municipality of Capriate d&#x27;Adda, joined Crespi that since that moment had been part of the municipality of Canonica d&#x27;Adda.

Only in 1928 did the municipality take its current form when the municipalities of Capriate d&#x27;Adda, San Gervasio d&#x27;Adda and Crespi became the new municipality of Capriate San Gervasio as it is today.

It received the honorary title of city () by a presidential decree on July 11, 2006.

==Geography==
It is situated on the southern tip of the so-called Bergamasca Island, a territory delimited by the rivers Adda and Brembo. It includes three hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) at slightly different altitudes: San Gervasio d&#x27;Adda (north), Capriate d&#x27;Adda (center) and Crespi d&#x27;Adda. The latter, a perfectly preserved example of a 19th-century &quot;workers&#x27; village&quot;, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The municipality borders Bottanuco, Brembate, Canonica d&#x27;Adda, Filago, Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda (MI) and Vaprio d&#x27;Adda (MI).

The municipality&#x27;s territory has a linear shape; it is located along the left bank of the river Adda, where the river turns into a characteristic double handle that creates a natural environment rich in vegetation.

It has a particular structure: from north to south it is composed of three different &quot;steps&quot;; each one has a historical urban settlement: the first is San Gervasio d&#x27;Adda (north), the second Capriate d&#x27;Adda (middle), and the last Crespi d&#x27;Adda (south).

== Monuments and places of interest ==

<doc id="1139912" wikidata="Q5639167" url="?curid=1139912" title="Hail, Pennsylvania!">
<text>&quot;Hail, Pennsylvania!&quot; () is a song written by Edgar M. Dilley (Class of 1897) as a submission to a University of Pennsylvania alumni committee-sponsored contest to write a song to the tune of &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot;, the national anthem of Imperial Russia, by Alexei Fyodorovich Lvov. Dilley was awarded $25 for creating it. It served as the regional anthem of Pennsylvania until 1990 and now serves as the municipal anthem of Scranton, Pennsylvania.

==History==
Dilley was an assistant director with the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The piece was first performed by his group at its annual concert at the Academy of Music in 1895. For many years, the song was performed at Franklin Field, when the football team suffered a loss. The song is presently performed at University functions and sporting events by the University of Pennsylvania Band and The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club.

Aside from becoming the alma mater of the University of Pennsylvania, the song also serves as the official song of Lackawanna County. Also, until 1990, the song served as the official song for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

== Lyrics ==
:Hail! Pennsylvania!
:Noble and strong;
:To thee with loyal hearts,
:We raise our song.
:Swelling to Heaven loud,
:Our praises ring;
:Hail! Pennsylvania,
:Of thee we sing!

:Majesty as a crown
:Rests on thy brow;
:Pride, Honor, Glory, Love,
:Before thee bow.
:Ne&#x27;er can thy spirit die,
:Thy walls decay;
:Hail! Pennsylvania,
:For thee we pray!

:Hail! Pennsylvania!
:Guide of our youth;
:Lead thou thy children on
:To light and truth;
:Thee, when death summons us,
:Others shall praise,
:Hail! Pennsylvania,
:Thro&#x27; endless days!

<doc id="1139913" wikidata="Q16150586" url="?curid=1139913" title="History of Worcestershire">
<text>The area now known as Worcestershire has had human presence for over half a million years. Interrupted by two ice ages, Worcestershire has had continuous settlement since roughly 10,000 years ago. In the Iron Age, the area was dominated by a series of hill forts, and the beginnings of industrial activity including pottery and salt mining can be found. It seems to have been relatively unimportant during the Roman era, with the exception of the salt workings.

During the Anglo-Saxon era, Worcestershire was an important base of Church power and learning. The county as a named political entity dates to this time, being formed in 918.

From the Middle Ages, the role of the city of Worcester becomes particularly important in the county. The city&#x27;s merchants, Church, aristocracy and gentry become the main power brokers, and tensions between them can be seen.

The county had an important role in the English Civil War, being part of the Royalists&#x27; front line, and already important for metal working and small arms. It was later the site of Charles II&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, and local Catholic aristocrats aided his escape. Northern Worcestershire produced a number of prominent religious leaders, many of whom left the Anglican church in the Great Ejection.

The northern part of Worcestershire, including the Dudley and Netherton enclave, was one of the major centres of the British Industrial Revolution. Dudley specialised in iron and coal production, Kidderminster in carpet production, Stourbridge in glass, Bromsgrove and areas of southern Birmingham in nail making, Redditch in needles and fish hooks. Canals and later railways aided export of local goods. Further south, Worcester&#x27;s glove and porcelain industries became less important than manufacturing.

Worcestershire is still important for agriculture, particularly in the Vale of Evesham.

Local government reorganisations meant that the Dudley enclave and the King&#x27;s Norton area of southern Birmingham are no longer in Worcestershire. Other smaller boundary changes have taken some parishes out of the county and added others.

==Prehistory==
===Paleolithic===

There is evidence of human presence in Worcestershire from the Paleolithic period, roughly 700,000–500,000 years ago. Flint axe heads have been found near at Hallow near Worcester, for instance. However, evidence from this period is hard to come by, not least because hunter-gathering societies would roam extensively and not congregate in towns and villages. Tools have mostly been recovered from sand and gravel quarries in the county. The lack of finds appears to be contributing to under-investment in seeking out and preserving them.

The first inhabitants appear to have followed the Bytham River system, which at the time drained eastwards from Evesham to East Anglia. Glaciation pushed settlement back, and humans again appear around 300,000 years ago. Nearly 40 hand axes from this period have been recovered, mostly from near the last glaciation of around 10,000 BC. 15 axes were recovered at Kemerton.

===Mesolithic===
Between 10,000 and 3,500 BC, at the start of the current Holocene period, the climate improved. Forests grew, allowing humans to reinhabit the area, again with a hunter-gatherer economy. Settlers of the Mesolithic period are often identified through their use of flint tools, such as the 1,400 fragments found near Kidderminster at Wribbenhall. Other finds included post holes, a hearth, gullies and a pit. This site has been dated to roughly 6,800 BC, making it the oldest settlement yet identified in Worcestershire. Pollen evidence shows that crops were already being grown and woodlands cleared.

===Neolithic===
The evidence for the Neolithic period is more extensive. Finds were first located before the Second World War in Bewdley, Lindridge, Broadwas and, at Worcester, a skull. Farming has left many traces, for instance cropmarks on gravel terraces. Settlements can be identified from post holes, for instance at Huntsman&#x27;s Quarry, Kemerton. However, the most obvious Neolithic evidence comes from their ritual landscape. At Fladbury, a possible cursus has been found, enclosures that may be defined in relationship to changes in the sky and stars. At Whittington Tump a hill has been heightened to make another ceremonial or burial monument.

Stone axes from the Neolithic show extensive trade links, including examples from Brittany and northern Italy or Switzerland, as well as Cornwall, North Wales and the Lake District. Pottery finds also start in this period. Finds at Clifton, Severn Stoke, include Grooved ware pottery, axes, and burnt stones used to heat water for cooking or possibly a sauna.

===Bronze Age===
Bronze Age finds include weapons come from Worcestershire&#x27;s valleys especially near potential fordable river crossings on the Avon such as Harvington, Evesham and Defford, and on the Severn, Bewdley, Holt, Worcester, Kempsey and Pixham. Flint axes, arrowheads, and flakes found in the Malvern area are attributed to early Bronze Age settlers Burial sites are also important sources of information about the Bronze Age. Around twenty barrows have been found in the county and two have been excavated, at Holt and Wyre Piddle.

Worcestershire changed during the Bronze Age to a predominantly agricultural landscape. Peat evidence from near Bredon Hill and Birlingham in the Avon area shows that it was cleared by the earlier part of the period. A lack of cereal grain finds has been interpreted as indicating that the land was used for cattle farming. The clearance of forest land is also evidenced by alluvium deposits on the lower lands in the county, caused by river flooding. A move towards open settlements may be detected as the lands became more fully occupied.

Current field systems may date from the later Bronze Age. For instance, the evidence at Kerton and Wyre Piddle shows a relationship between the Bronze Age boundaries and contemporary fields. The &quot;Shire Ditch&quot;, a late Bronze Age boundary earthwork possibly dates from around 1000 BC, its boundary being respected by later settlement patterns. Similarly, Roman field boundaries seem to have kept their alignment with a Bronze Age boundary at Childswickham.

Bronze Age evidence also shows bronze casting and textiles at Kemerton.

===Iron Age===
 From around 600BC, Iron Age became the predominant technology, being harder than bronze and easy to manipulate into many tools. In Worcestershire, the most visible reminder of the period is hill forts. There around ten or twelve extant, including British Camp, Wychbury Hill and Hanbury. The full list may include east of the Severn Bredon Hill, Conderton Camp, and Headless Cross; and west of the Severn, Woodbury Hill, Berrow Hill Camp and Gadbury Bank

A promontory fort can be found by the Severn at Kempsey. Many are visible to each other, suggesting that they were centres of organisation and power. Their functions may have included meeting places, a means to control livestock, grain storage, residences and tribal centres.

Farming in the period shows a mixture of settlements lasting long periods, but not being fully stable and permanent. The middle of the period seems to be marked by the abandonment of both farms and hill forts. However, there is also continuity between this period and the Roman occupation.

The Wyche Cutting, a pass through the Malvern hills, was in use the Iron Age as part of the salt route from Droitwich to South Wales. A 19th-century discovery of over two hundred metal money bars near the Wyche cutting has been said to suggest that the Malvern area had been inhabited by the La Tène people around 250 BC.

Evidence of Iron Age salt production has been found at Droitwich itself. A pottery industry exporting into the surrounding area began in the Malvern area, continuing into the Middle Ages.

==Roman==

A period of client state relations, with tributes and political arrangements being made between the Roman Empire and Celtic Britons preceded the invasion. Caesar attempted it and Augustus planned to the same. Emperor Claudius successfully conquered Britain in a campaign starting in 43AD.

Excavations at Midsummer Hill fort, Bredon Hill, and Conderton Camp all show evidence of violent destruction around the year 48 AD. This may suggest that British Camp was also abandoned or destroyed around the same time.

Worcestershire was quickly behind Roman front lines. This means that there is little evidence of Roman military presence in the county, excepting some ten small road defences, such as one near Kempsey that appears to have belonged to the Roman Second Legion &quot;Augusta&quot;, headquartered at Isca Augusta, Caerleon in South Wales. There are also bridge remains over the Severn near Kempsey which have been attributed to the Romans.

Two forts have been found at Dodderhill next to the Droitwich salt workings. A villa or other high-profile building with mosaics has also been found here in 1847 during the construction of the canal and railway. There is evidence for Roman industrial production such as iron works in Worcester, but no sign of municipal buildings, although a small defended site has been detected, perhaps to guard the river crossing.

Excavations at Kings Norton found signs of a small Romano-British settlement, including kilns for pottery manufacture, and more recently Roman pottery and a Roman ditch at Parsons Hill, near Icknield Street.

Worcestershire as a whole does not seem to have been prominent in the villa system, except in its south eastern corner, near the Cotswolds, where Romanised agriculture was deeply established. Worcestershire was also not on the network of major Roman roads, although a number of roads have been detected.

==Anglo-Saxon==
The Roman administrative system appears to have disappeared swiftly after the withdrawal of their troops. However, Worcestershire probably remained Romano-British in cultural, linguistic and religious terms. There is little archaeological evidence. There appears to have been farming activity in Worcester, such as a few farmhouses and evidence for grazing at Deansway. There is evidence that St Helen&#x27;s Church in Worcester could have had a British origin. Salt workings in Droitwich appear to have continued.

===Kingdom of the Hwicce===

The conquest of the area by Anglo-Saxons appears to have been relatively late. Gloucester and Bath were taken around 577 by the West Saxons at the Battle of Deorham. In 613, the Battle of Chester pushed the Welsh beyond the River Dee. In these early years, it is possible that very minor kingdoms or fiefdoms were established, for instance of the Weorgoran, from which it is believed Worcester takes its name.

The area now known as Worcestershire was part of the early English kingdom of the Hwicce, which was quickly made subordinate to Mercia. The exact boundaries of their kingdom are uncertain, but it is likely that they coincided with those of the old Diocese of Worcester. The kingdom would, therefore, have included Worcestershire except for its northwestern tip. The toponym &quot;Hwicce&quot; survives in Worcestershire in the names of Wichenford, Wychbury Hill and Droitwich.

===Diocese of Worcester===

The diocese was founded in 679–680, and early bishops bore the title &quot;Episcopus Hwicciorum&quot;. The diocese seems to have benefited in the 8th century from the support of the kings of Mercia. Through royal support the bishopric was able to gradually extend its control over prominent minsters. Initially, these were under the control of Hwiccan royals, as family property. This appears to have been gradually transferred to the control of the Bishopric, under the sponsorship of the Mercian kings, the process driven by the self-interest of the Mercian monarchy. As well as undermining local rivals through this process, the Mercian kings also derived revenue from church lands in this period.

Consequently, in the 9th century, the bishopric of Worcester can be seen to be the most powerful ecclesiastical power in Mercia during this time. From this position the church was able to use its great wealth to buy privileges from the kings of Mercia.

Later in the period it was from Mercia, in particular Worcester, that King Alfred began to recruit priests and monks with whom to rebuild the church in Wessex during the 880s (Asser, ch. 77). It has been argued that these priests brought with them a new attitude towards the church&#x27;s place within society and its relationship with the monarchy. Consequently, from the bishopric of Worcester there developed a new ecclesiastical ideology that would become the accepted Anglo-Saxon church.

The chaos of the period 900–1060 led to the loss of ecclesiastical lands, through leases and loss of records. Leases were often made for three lifetimes, but tended to become permanent arrangements. The result was that by Domesday, some 45% of the diocese&#x27;s church lands were held by tenants under leases.

 Worcester was a centre of monastic learning and church power. Oswald of Worcester was an important reformer, appointed Bishop in 961, jointly with York. The last Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, or St Wulstan, was also an important reformer, and stayed in post until his death in 1095.

===Alfred and Edward===
Worcestershire was absorbed into the unified Kingdom of England in 927, when it was also first constituted as a county. It was a separate ealdormanship briefly in the 10th century before forming part of the Earldom of Mercia in the 11th century. In the years leading up to the Norman conquest in 1066, the Church, including the Priory Cathedral, Evesham Abbey, Pershore Abbey, Fladbury, Malvern Priory and other religious houses, increasingly dominated the county.

During King Alfred&#x27;s reign, the earls of Mercia fortified Worcester &quot;for the protection of all the people&quot; at the request of Bishop Werfrith. It appears that maintenance of the defences was to be paid for by the townspeople. A unique document detailing this and privileges granted to the church also outlines the existence of Worcester&#x27;s market and borough court, differentiation between church and market quarters within the city, as well as the role of the King in relation to the roads.

Worcester&#x27;s fortifications would most likely have established the line of the wall that was extant until the 1600s, perhaps excepting the south-east area near the former castle (see Worcester city walls). It is referred to as a wall by contemporaries, so may have been of stone.

Worcester became the focus of tax resistance against the Danish Harthacanute. Two huscarls were killed in May 1041 while attempting to collect taxes for the expanded navy, after being driven into the priory, where they were murdered. A military force was sent to deal with the non-payment, while the townspeople attempted to defend themselves by moving to and occupying the island of Bevere, two miles up the river, where they were then besieged. After Harthacnut&#x27;s men had sacked the city and set it alight, agreement was reached.

The last Anglo-Saxon sheriff of the county was Cyneweard of Laughern.

==Medieval==
===Economic development===
During the Middle Ages, much of the county&#x27;s economy was based on the wool trade, and many areas of its dense forests, such as Feckenham Forest, Horewell Forest, Ombersley, Wyre Forest and Malvern Chase, were royal hunting grounds. Droitwich Spa, being situated on large deposits of salt, was a centre of salt production from Roman times, with one of the principal Roman roads running through the town.

Farming in the early Middle Ages tended to increase production through expanding the area of land cultivated, particularly from the forested and waste areas. Surplus production was quite limited, especially after feudal dues were given or paid, leaving peasant farmers making only slightly more than subsistence levels in most of the county. Poor harvests in 1315, 1316 and 1322 pushed food prices up and probably weakened the population&#x27;s resistance to disease. The Black Death arrived in Worcestershire in 1348–9. Outbreaks in 1361, 1369 and 1375 together reduced the population by around a third, as in other parts of England. Some villages were abandoned entirely, sometimes leaving churches alone with no supporting settlement.

The Priory Cathedral was a major landowner and economic force, both in Worcester and the county. The Church and other monastic communities together controlled more than half of the land in Worcestershire, a particularly high proportion. The Priory&#x27;s properties for instance included the priory manor of Bromsgrove after it was donated by Henry III. It was a centre of learning and provided schooling. It was associated with hospitals. The Church received a portion of local taxations and ecclesiastical law applied to Christian morals and could result in punishments. It had close political associations with leading gentry and aristocracy. As such, Worcester&#x27;s Cathedral had a central role in the medieval life of the city and county. In the early medieval period, as the settled areas of the country expanded into the more wooded areas in the north and west, the church was able to increase its share of the wealth of Worcestershire, as it dominated the newly settled areas that brought in new income, such as settlements at Kempsey, Wick Episcopi, Hanbury, Hartlebury, Wolverley and Inkberrow.

The Cathedral was one of a number of religious institutions in Worcester. Rivalry between the different religious orders sometimes resulted in disorder, including on occasion, removing dead bodies when the right to bury a prominent person was disputed. Sponsorship of the differing orders also reflected family interests, with particular families having strong associations with specific orders. This was also true in the county as a whole.

The Droitwich salt-industry was very important at the time of the Domesday Survey, Bromsgrove alone sending 300 cartloads of wood yearly to the salt-works. In the 13th and 14th centuries Bordesley monastery and the abbeys of Evesham and Pershore exported wool to the Florentine and Flemish markets. Coal and iron were mined at Dudley from the 13th century, coal since at least 1292.

===Norman Conquest===

The first Norman Sheriff of Worcestershire, Urse d&#x27;Abetot oversaw the construction of a new castle at Worcester, although nothing now remains of the castle. Worcester Castle was in place by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral.

Worcester&#x27;s Bishop Wulfstan was the last Anglo-Saxon bishop in England.

===Land ownership and administration after the conquest===
====Church lands====
After the Norman conquest of England; the Domesday Book noted in 1086 that in seven of the twelve hundreds covering Worcestershire, the Crown had no authority. The Crown&#x27;s authority was replaced by the Bishop of Worcester and the Abbots at Pershore, Westminster and Evesham.

At this time, more than half of Worcestershire was in the hands of the church. The church of Worcester held the triple hundred of Op.waldslow, with such privileges as to exclude the sheriff&#x27;s jurisdiction entirely, the profits of all the local courts accruing to the bishop, whose bailiffs in 1276 claimed to hold his hundred outside Worcester, at Dryhurst, and at Wimborntree. The two hundreds owned by the church of Westminster, and that owned by Pershore, had in the 13th century been combined to form the hundred of Pershore, while the hundred of Evesham owned by Evesham Abbey had been converted into Blackenhurst hundred; and the irregular boundaries and outlying portions of these hundreds are explained by their having been formed out of the scattered endowments of their ecclesiastical owners. Of the remaining Domesday hundreds, Came, Clent, Cresselaw and Esch had been combined to form the hundred of Halfshire by the 13th century, while Doddingtree remained unchanged. The shire-court was held at Worcester.

====Distribution of lands to Normans====

William the Conqueror gave to his allies and friends manors and parishes captured from the Anglo-Saxons. According to the Domesday Book; King William gave Dudley and other manors such as Selly Oak, Bartley Green, Northfield, Frankley, and Bromsgrove (Willingwick) to Ansculf de Picquigny - Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, and Hala to Roger de Montgomerie, who became Earl of Shrewsbury. Whilst Doddingtree Hundred was gifted to Raoul II of Tosny, seigneur de Conches-en-Ouche, Ranulph de Mortimer, and Osbern Fitz Richard. Despite the Norman Conquest; the rest of the county was still held by the Abbeys of Pershore and Evesham, the Bishop of Worcester and Priory - these hundreds became known as Oswaldslow and Fisseberge (latterly Blakenhurst), along with the unnamed hundreds of Pershore and Westminster.

The first Norman Sheriff Urse d&#x27;Abetot, built the castle of Worcester and seized much church land, some of which became part of the Crown&#x27;s hundreds in Worcestershire - Dimidii Comitatus de Wych (which became known as Halfshire) and Doddingtree. d&#x27;Abetot was in dispute with Bishop Wulfstan over the rights of the sheriff in the lands of Oswaldslow, and Blakenhurst. Meanwhile, in Halfshire; landowners in Alvechurch, Hanbury, and Inkberrow handed over their manors to the church, effectively transferring jurisdiction to Oswaldslow.

 The vast possessions of the church prevented the growth of a great territorial aristocracy in Worcestershire, and Dudley Castle, which passed from William Fitz-Ansculf to the families of Paynel and Somen, was the sole residence of a feudal baron. The Domesday fief of Urse d&#x27;Abitot the sheriff, founder of Worcester Castle, and of his brother Robert le Despenser passed in the 12th century to the Beauchamps, who owned Elmley and Hanley Castles. The possessions of William Fitz Osbern in Doddingtree hundred and the Teme valley fell to the crown after his rebellion in 1074 and passed to the Mortimers. Hanley Castle and Malvern Chase were granted by Henry III. to Gilbert de Clare, with exemption from the sheriff&#x27;s jurisdiction.

====Beauchamp Sheriffs of Worcestershire====
The position of the Sheriff of Worcestershire was hereditary, one of only three to remain so. The Beauchamp family held it, and were therefore responsible for aspects of the law, some military duties and tax collection. They were obliged to pay fixed amounts of tax revenue to the Crown, and in addition frequently held Royal Forests, including Feckenham, in return for a payment, or &quot;farm&quot;. This led to significant corruption and abuse. In the 1200s Walter de Beauchamp (justice) and his son William (III) de Beauchamp extracted taxes to their own benefit, ensuring that little or no money due to the Crown was paid to it. Walter de Beauchamp was removed from office in 1229, but reinstated within a year. No money was paid in 1224-8 and none from 1229–35, including arrears.

After William (III) de Beauchamp inherited the position, the farm of Feckenham Forest was unpaid for 12 years to 1242, and unpaid sums from his Walter&#x27;s time also remained unpaid. William used powers of assize to harass free tenants in the Doddingtree hundred, who agreed to pay a large annual fine to stop this activity. An inquest in 1274-5 found that he had &quot;appropriated&quot; Doddingtree and Halfshire hundreds, which had been achieved by using his officials to harass the residents. He ran a long dispute with the Bishop Walter de Cantilupe, resulting in the Pope backing William&#x27;s excommunication for abusing church rights over the liberty of Oswaldslaw, which in turn pushed Henry III to support de Beauchamp over the church. The excommunication was lifted in 1251 by the bishop. A settlement allowed the church to retain its rights, in return for a payment for the income that would be lost to the Crown, but poor wording of the agreement allowed de Beauchamp to continue the dispute until 1258.

By the end of his life, William (III) de Beauchamp had agreed to pay the Crown £10 a year to clear the debts from unpaid revenues and farms. However, these payments proved insufficient and continued to be paid by his son after his death. Historian Emma Mason regards it as remarkable that the de Beauchamp family&#x27;s abuses were tolerated by the Crown, and that the hereditary nature of Worcestershire&#x27;s Sherriffs was not abolished as it had been elsewhere.

===King Stephen===

The nineteen-year conflict between King Stephen and Empress Matilda over the English crown had impacts in Worcestershire. Matilda&#x27;s brother was the Earl of Gloucester, placing Worcester close to one of her most powerful allies. As war broke out in 1138, Stephen attacked Dudley Castle, held by Ralf Pagenal, allied to the Empress. Stephen ravaged the surrounding countryside but could not take the castle. In Easter 1139, Stephen made a royal visit to Worcester and made offerings at the Cathedral. Around this time he also created the Earldom of Worcester, giving the title to Waleran de Beaumont, a close ally.

In 1140, Empress Matilda&#x27;s allies were in Gloucester, while she was under siege in Oxford. Rumours of an imminent attack on Worcester by Matilda&#x27;s allies drove Worcester&#x27;s citizens to take refuge in the Cathedral. The attack came in November. Worcester&#x27;s citizens repulsed the attack at the castle, but houses were burnt, prisoners taken for ransom and livestock stolen. Waleran attacked Sudeley Castle and Tewkesbury in revenge.

Miles of Gloucester, the Sheriff, sided with the Empress. He was rewarded with the title of Earl of Hereford. Stephen made the grandson of Urse d&#x27;Abitot William de Beauchamp Sheriff in his place. He was put in charge of Worcester&#x27;s castle in 1145, and Waleran went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.

In 1150, Waleran sided with Matilda and defended Worcester against attack by Stephen. Worcester was burnt and plundered, this time by King Stephen, when he took the city. The war came to an end in 1153, with Stephen agreeing that Matilda&#x27;s heir would succeed him, in return for peace.

===Henry II===

Henry II restored his authority in the Marches early after his coronation, particularly acting against Roger, Earl of Hereford and Hugh de Mortimer in Shropshire. He visited Worcester and was ceremonially crowned (that is, wore his crown in public) twice in the city. At Easter 1158, one of these occasions, he held a Royal Council at the city.

Henry II implemented a number of administrative and legal reforms. He reorganised the English judicial system, implementing circuits, where judges would visit courts in turn. Worcestershire, Shrophsire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire formed one of these.

Henry II&#x27;s dispute with Thomas Becket reached Worcester as the Bishop Roger attempted to support Becket and the independence of the Church. He wrote to the King to intercede on behalf of Becket after his exile, which provoked Henry to instruct him to keep away from Becket in his exile. Roger ignored the instruction, and was in turn exiled. He remained in exile, despite attempts by the Pope to reconcile him with Henry, and eventually was sent to Rome by the King after Becket&#x27;s murder to attempt to convince the Pope that he was not involved.

===Richard I===

Worcester received its first royal charter from Richard I in 1189. This set out the annual payment made to the Crown as £24 per annum, and set out that the city would deal directly with the Crown&#x27;s Exchequer, rather than through the county sheriff, who would no longer have general jurisdiction over the city.

===King John===
King John made eleven visits to Worcester, including at his first Easter as King in 1200. Wulfstan was made a saint in 1203, and John visited his shrine in 1207. He appears to have developed an attachment to Wulfstan&#x27;s cult because he appeared to support the authority of kings. However, despite John&#x27;s apparent attachment to the city, its charter was not renewed, which allowed him to levy increasing and arbitrary taxation (tallage) on Worcester.

John attempted to claim the right to appoint English bishops, which led him into a long dispute with the Pope. Bishop Mauger of Worcester was appointed by the Pope to enforce his Interdict, alongside the Bishops of London and Ely. He was forced into exile and his possessions confiscated as a result.

John spent Christmas 1214 at Worcester, during his disputes with the Barons over the administration of justice, before returning to London where discussions leading to Magna Carta began. In 1216, the barons asked the French Dauphin to depose John. This brought conflict to Worcestershire, where the county &#x27;s leaders organised against him, and allowed William Marshall, son of the Earl of Pembroke, who was loyal to John, to take possession of Worcester as governor. Ranulph, Earl of Chester attacked the city, took the castle and ransacked the Cathedral, where the garrison had attempted to take shelter. Marshal was warned of the attack by his father, and was able to escape.

The priory was fined for protecting the rebels and were forced to melt down the treasures used to adorn St Wulfstan&#x27;s tomb. The city of Worcester was fined £100 for its role, a fine which he could impose due to the lack of a city charter.

John was buried in the cathedral near Wulfstan&#x27;s altar after he died.

===The diocese and Worcester&#x27;s Jewry===

Worcester had a small Jewish population by the late 12th century. It was one of a number of places allowed to keep records of debts, in an official locked chest known as an archa. (An archa or arca (plural archae/arcae) was a municipal chest in which deeds were preserved.)
 Jewish life probably centred around what is now Copenhagen Street.

The diocese was notably hostile to the Jewish community in Worcester. Peter of Blois was commissioned by a Bishop of Worcester, probably John of Coutances, to write a significant anti-Judaic treatise &quot;Against the Perfidy of Jews&quot; around 1190.

William de Blois, as Bishop of Worcester, imposed particularly strict rules on Jews within the diocese in 1219. As elsewhere in England, Jews were officially compelled to wear square white badges, supposedly representing tabulae. In most places, this requirement was relinquished as long as fines were paid. In addition to enforcing the church laws on wearing badges, Blois tried to impose additional restrictions on usury, and wrote to Pope Gregory in 1229 to ask for better enforcement and further, harsher measures. In response, the Papacy demanded that Christians be prevented from working in Jewish homes, &quot;lest temporal profit be preferred to the zeal of Christ&quot;, and enforcement of the wearing of badges.

===Henry III===

Henry III made a gift of the manor of Bromsgrove to Worcester Priory, to support its memorial of his father King John.

A national assembly of Jewish notables was summoned to Worcester by the Crown in 1240 to assess their wealth for taxation; at which Henry III &quot;squeezed the largest tallage of the thirteenth century from his Jewish subjects&quot;.

Henry III was embroiled in disputes with his Barons for a great deal of his reign. In the 1260s, this broke out into war. In 1263 Worcester&#x27;s Jewish residents were attacked by a baronial force led by Robert Earl Ferrers and Henry de Montfort. Most were killed. Ferrers used this opportunity to remove the titles to his debts by taking the archae.

The massacre in Worcester was part of a wider campaign by the De Montforts and their allies in the run-up to the Second Barons&#x27; War, aimed at undermining Henry III. A massacre of London&#x27;s Jewry also took place during the war. Worcestershire was the site of the Battle of Evesham in which Simon de Montfort was killed on 4 August 1265, effectively ending any hope for his allies of winning the war.

A few years later, in 1275, the Jews that were still living in Worcester were forced to move to Hereford, as they were expelled from all towns under the jurisdiction of the queen mother.

===Worcestershire in Parliament===
As early as 1295 Worcestershire was represented by sixteen members in Parliament, returning two knights for the shire and two burgesses each for the city of Worcester and the boroughs of Bromsgrove, Droitwich, Dudley, Evesham, Kidderminster and Pershore. With the exception of Droitwich, however, which was represented until 1311 and again recovered representation in 1554, the boroughs ceased to make returns. Evesham was re-enfranchised in 1604, and in 1606 Bewdley returned one member. Under the Reform Act 1832 the county returned four members in two divisions; Droitwich lost one member; Dudley and Kidderminster were re-enfranchised, returning one member each. In 1867 Evesham lost one member.

==Early modern==
===Industrial and agricultural change===
In the 16th century, the Worcestershire clothing industry gave employment to 8000 people. The clothing industry declined in the 17th century, but the silk-manufacture later replaced it at Kidderminster and Blockley.

Henry VIII confined cloth making to Bromsgrove, Kidderminster, Droitwich, Evesham and Worcester. Rural production of cloth had been spurred by rural poverty and the need to supplement incomes. Trade in Worcester and the cloth trade in Kidderminster was still controlled by guilds. Fulling (cleaning new cloth) around Worcester and dyeing in the Teme valley, for instance in Tenbury and Clifton, were major employers. Rope making was prominent around Bromsgrove. However, tanning was probably the largest single industry across the county, concentrated near rivers and streams in the north and west of the county.

Glassmaking was first established in Stourbridge in the early 1600s, by Hugeonot emigres. Sir Robert Mansell&#x27;s obtaining a national monopoly on glass production was pivotal in using the local clay to make glass pots, and greatly expanded the local industry, which began manufacturing window panes as well as bottles and pots. Glass manufacturers were instructed in 1615 to use coal for fuel, as woodlands were increasingly under pressure, and timber needed for shipbuilding as well as fuel.

The northern part of the county was already known for metalwork, but was still dependent on small furnaces powered by hand bellows for iron production until shortly before the Civil War, when charcoal furnaces using water powered bellows began to be introduced. Smithies were generally owned by landowners and leased to smiths, who were not organised into guilds, unlike their counterparts in Coventry. This freedom from price and production control may in part explain the industry&#x27;s sudden growth in the seventeenth century, which caused rivalry with guilds in London who attempted to stop the flow of Midlands goods into their markets. The greatest benefits of the trade accrued to ironmasters who purchased goods from the local producers for sale onwards.

Efforts to make iron with coal began in Dudley in the early 1600s, described in Dud Dudley&#x27;s book &quot;Metallum martis&quot;, although these were likely less successful than he depicted.

Nailmaking established itself in the northern parts of the county, such as Bromsgrove, Stourbridge and Dudley. Like other metal trades, it served as a way to supplement otherwise low rural incomes, and then replaced other labouring work for many. It grew in part because of the access that the Severn river gave to national and international markets, alongside the local production of iron. Again the nailmasters, who resold nails into the markets beyond the county gained the most from this trade, which even in this period was low paid and exploited.

Scythe making concentrated in the Clent Hills area as water power was needed to make them. It was a skilled process, and Scythe makers could be quite wealthy.

The period also saw many changes to agriculture. For instance, tobacco was grown in Worcestershire in the Eckington and Evesham areas. There were 17 growers in 1627, when it was banned after pressure from colonial producers. Tobacco continued to be grown illegally through most of the rest of the century. The potato, on the other hand, while introduced to the country, was not widely cultivated. In the north east, grain production began to increase, as well as pasture of cattle and sheep, which grew by 50% in Belbroughton, Bromsgrove and Chaddesley Corbett in the 1600s. Other innovations included the promotion of clover was by Andrew Yarranton of Astley in 1663.

Hops may also have been introduced to Worcestershire around this period. Flax and hemp, vital to the cloth trade, were grown, as was woad, for dyeing. The county grew extensive fruit crops, especially apples and pears, but also plums, cherries, other soft fruits and vines. Cider and perry production also thrived. Mulberries were encouraged by James I and Charles II as a prelude to introducing a silk industry, supporting silk-manufacture later established at Kidderminster and Blockley. Market gardening also developed in the period, especially in the Evesham area.

===Reformation===
Worcester Priory came to an end with King Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries. Shortly beforehand, in 1535, the prior William More resigned, and was replaced by Henry Holbeach. More had a reputation for fine living, although his standards seem in line with other senior ecclesiasts of the time. However, there certainly were problems with the administration of the priory, including divisions within the community.

The Protestant Hugh Latimer was bishop from 1535, and preached for reform and iconoclasm. He resigned as bishop in 1539, as a result of a theological turn by Henry VIII towards Roman Catholicism, in the Six Articles. John Bell, a moderate reformer, was bishop from 1539 to 1543, during the period of the priory&#x27;s dissolution.

In the early 16th century, Worcester had around 40 monks. This declined slightly in the years immediately before 1540, as recruitment seems to have halted. There were 35 Benedictine monks plus the Prior Holbeach at the time of dissolution, probably 16 January 1540; eleven were immediately given pensions, while the remainder became secular canons in the new Royal College. Holbeach was re-appointed as the first Dean. A further five former monks were pensioned from the college in July 1540.

The abolition of the monasteries caused a major reorganisation of the educational system for young people, mostly sons of gentry, who were given Latin and grammar schooling through monastic schools up until this point. The Royal Grammar School, Worcester claims descent from one of these. King Henry set up replacement grammar schools, often still provided in close association with the Church. King&#x27;s School, Worcester is one of these.

The former monastic library of Worcester Priory contained a considerable number of manuscripts which are, among other libraries, now scattered over Cambridge, London (British Library), Oxford Bodleian, and the Cathedral library at Worcester of today. Remains of the priory dating from the 12th and 13th centuries can still be seen. John Bell&#x27;s successor as bishop, Nicholas Heath, was religiously much more conservative and Catholic. The records from the dissolution give detail about other religious houses in Worcestershire.

While the estates of Worcester Priory were transferred to the Chapter and Dean, others were sold off. Many establishments were ransacked, and little was left when the buildings were sold. The estates were often sold to people connected at court, including Sir John Packington who bought 30 manors in Worcestershire, forming the basis for his estate including Hampton Lovett and Chaddesley Corbett where his descendants built Harvington Hall. Nevertheless, changes in land ownership in Worcestershire were less than in other areas.

Although Roman Catholicism was officially abolished, a number of Worcestershire&#x27;s aristocratic families remained Catholic. Several were involved in the Gunpowder Plot in 1604. Some Worcestershire houses have priest holes that survive from the 16th and 17th centuries (for example Harvington Hall has seven).

The reformation also brought change to rural customs, feasts and fairs, which became gradually more detached from religious significance. As Puritanism rose as a social force in the 1620s and 30s, village sports and activities such as Maypole and Morris dancing came under attack, for instance from legislation in the 1620s. Worcester raised funds to keep players out of the city in 1632 and 1634. These activities did however gain a revival after the restoration.

===Gunpowder Plot===

Robert Wintour and other conspirators devised a plan to blow up the new Scottish Protestant King James I at the Wintour&#x27;s home at Huddington Court. Robert Catesby, the main figure behind the Gunpowder Plot, was from Northampton, but most of the plotters were from Worcestershire&#x27;s Catholic families.

===Charles I===
After 1629, Charles I attempted to rule without Parliament. This forced him to raise taxes and other revenues, which had a number of impacts on Worcestershire. The sale of royal lands, particularly forests, led to attempts to enclose Malvern Chase and the more successful sale of Feckenham Forest in the 1630s, which in both cases had led to rioting as well as the displacement of the rural poor that had depended on the use of these Royal lands as effectively common land, with long-established although informal usage rights. Other local grievances against the Crown included action to suppress profitable tobacco production, which was well established in the Vale of Evesham.

Taxes on imports of goods known as &#x27;tonnage and poundage&#x27; were imposed, which reduced the profitability of trade and created opposition in urban centres including Worcester. Similarly, the Ship Money taxation levied in 1636 fell heavily on Worcester, which was the sixteenth highest paying city in England. Puritans including Richard Baxter noted the mounting opposition to Royal policies within the county. The unpopularity of these Royalist policies stemmed from the perception that Charles I was attempting to establish a more authoritarian, non-parliamentary kind of monarchy.

Charles I&#x27;s religious policies also provoked suspicion in Worcestershire. Although the county had a Catholic minority among its aristocratic families, the vast majority of the population was firmly Anglican, with a growing group of more radical Protestants in its towns. They had increasing social influence, for instance about public morality and observance of the Sabbath. Increased interest in religious doctrine led to several Worcestershire towns funding lecturers to deliver sermons, including Baxter in Kidderminster. Worcestershire produced some other notable Puritan figures, including Edward Winslow, who migrated to new England with the Pilgrim Fathers. Charles&#x27; apparent Catholic sympathies, such as the reforms of William Laud that reintroduced many of the trappings of Catholicism back into the Church of England, would have been viewed with suspicion by many. In Worcester, Roger Mainwaring, as Dean, reintroduced vestments and constructed a marble altar.

In the early 1640s, stories of massacres of Protestants in Ireland helped led to rumours of Catholic plots that spread through the county leading to anti-Catholic riots in Bewdley in late 1641, and instructions to local militias to guard against conspiracies in the following months.

===Civil War===
Worcestershire was under Royalist control during most of the First Civil War. Like many parts of England, there was little enthusiasm for either side, and the initial instincts of many was to try to avoid conflict. Different parts of the county had different sympathies, for instance Evesham was notably Parliamentarian, and Kidderminster also had a strong Parliamentarian contingent. The city of Worcester equivocated about whether to support the Parliamentary cause before the outbreak of civil war in 1642, but eventually sided with Parliament. It was however soon under Royalist occupation, as was the rest of the county.

In 1642 the first major skirmish of the Civil War, the Battle of Powick Bridge, on the River Teme close to Worcester, occurred when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by Prince Rupert, a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war, defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel John Brown.

The Cathedral was used to store arms during the war, possibly as early as September 1642. While Worcester declared itself for Parliament, it was swiftly occupied by the Royalists, who were using the building to store munitions when Essex briefly retook the city after the Powick Bridge skirmish on its outskirts. Parliamentary troops then ransacked the cathedral building. Stained glass was smashed and the organ destroyed, along with library books and monuments. The See was abolished during the Commonwealth and the Protectorate, approximately 1646–60.

Worcester was one of three garrison towns in the county and had to bear the expense of sustaining and billeting a large number of Royalist troops. During the Royalist occupation, the suburbs were destroyed to make defence easier. Responsibility for maintenance of defences was transferred to the military command. High taxation was imposed, and many male residents impressed into the army.

The same pressures created great strain on the county as a whole, as it had to sustain a large, unproductive force drawn out of its productive labour. Taxation, requisitioning by armies and cross-border raids caused great deprivations, made worse by the proximity of Worcestershire to Parliamentary forces to the north around Birmingham, to the east in Warwickshire, and at certain times to the south in Bristol and Gloucestershire. Nevertheless, the county was strategically vital to the Royalists, as a bridge from Wales and Ireland back to their headquarters in Oxford. Worcestershire also provided the Royalists with industrial capacity to produce armaments and munitions.

Bands of Clubmen formed in west Worcestershire in the later part of the first war, with the objective of keeping both armies and their demands away from the rural civilian population, to resist despoliation and requisitioning. There was also a vein of resentment towards the prominent role given many Catholics in the county. The Clubmen&#x27;s Woodbury Hill proclamation stated that they would not obey any Papist or Papist Recusant, &quot;nor ought [they] … be trusted in any office of state, justice, or judicature&quot;.

As Royalist power collapsed in May 1646, Worcester was placed under siege. Worcester had around 5,000 civilians, together with a Royalist garrison of around 1,500 men, facing a 2,500–5,000 strong force of the New Model Army. Worcester finally surrendered on 23 July, bringing the first civil war to a close in Worcestershire.

In 1651 a Scottish army marched south along the west coast in support of Charles II&#x27;s attempt to regain the Crown and entered the county. The 16,000 strong Scottish force caused Worcester&#x27;s council to vote to surrender as it approached, fearing further violence and destruction. The Parliamentary garrison decided to withdraw to Evesham in the face of the overwhelming numbers against them. The Scots were billeted in and around Worcester, again at great expense and causing new anxiety for the residents. The Scots were joined by very limited local forces, including a company of 60 men under John Talbot.

The Battle of Worcester (3 September 1651), took place in the fields a little to the west and south of the city, near the village of Powick. Charles II was easily defeated by Cromwell&#x27;s forces of 30,000 men. Charles II returned to his headquarters in what is now known as King Charles House in the Cornmarket, before fleeing in disguise with Talbot&#x27;s help to Boscobel House in Shropshire, from where he eventually escaped to France. Parliamentary forces ransacked the city, causing over £70,000 of damage according to the city council. Scottish troops fleeing capture were attacked and killed in local skirmishes, while the vast majority were pressed into forced labour in the east of England or new world.

===The Restoration===
====Religion, dissenters and Catholicism====
At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Worcester&#x27;s cathedral was in considerable disrepair. Only three canons were alive from the period before the Bishopric&#x27;s abolition in 1649. The new treasurer Barnabas Oley estimated the cost of restoring the damage to the cathedral buildings at over £16,000.

Between 1660 and 1662, Parliament supported a very broad toleration of views in the Church of England, and did not seek to expel ministers except those with most radical religious views. This ended in 1662, when the Act of Uniformity required ministers to accept the Church of England prayer book. Around 2,000 Anglican ministers from the Commonwealth period resigned from the Church of England, including Richard Baxter of Kidderminster, who had also acted as chaplain to Parliamentary troops; he was replaced by his predecessor George Dance. Over 95 of these oustings took place in Worcestershire.

In Bromsgrove, John Spilsbury, previously a fellow of Magdalen College, was removed after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, and left the Church of England by refusing to conform to the Act of Uniformity Thomas Hall, at King&#x27;s Norton, was also expelled.

Spilsbury was confined to his house, banished from the county and finally imprisoned for his non-conformism. He did return to Bromsgrove, where he was annually visited by Hall&#x27;s son, an Anglican bishop.

Changes to the law in 1672 removed the threat of prison and allowed places of worship to be established by licence for some nonconformist groups. Presbyterians were stronger in north Worcestershire, while Congregationalists and Independents could be found more towards the middle and south east.

Splisbury was licensed as a Congregationalist teacher in 1672 in Bromsgrove and died in 1699. Spilsbury&#x27;s son John led a dissenting congregation in Kidderminster, and in turn, his son Francis Spilsbury became a minister at Salters&#x27; Hall in London.

Tolerance for Quakers and Anabaptists was much lower. Quaker leader George Fox was arrested on a visit to Tredington in 1673, however Quakers legally established a meeting house in Worcestershire in Stourbridge in 1688. Anabaptists were strongest in east Worcestershire, where they had strongest support among poorer people, for instance at Kington, where they had congregations in 1669.

At the other end of the religious spectrum, many of the aristocratic families of Worcestershire were Catholics, and were also unable to fully participate in public life. Catholic worship was illegal, however an average of eight priests operated in the county during the seventeenth century. In 1678, during anti-Catholic panic spread after the exposure of an alleged &quot;Popish Plot&quot; against Charles II, Father John Wall who was based at Harvington Hall, was arrested at Rushock Court and imprisoned at Worcester Castle. Although there was little evidence against him, he was hanged, drawn and quartered, the last Catholic to be executed for his faith in the United Kingdom.

====Final years of Charles II====
Charles II&#x27;s last years were dominated by his attempts to face down demands from the Whigs to prevent the succession to the throne of a Catholic, Charles&#x27; brother James being next in line. To this end, Charles dissolved the 1681 Parliament, which was debating an Exclusion Bill, and then attempted to limit the ability of towns and cities to elect MPs that were unsympathetic to his views. The mechanism for this was the alteration of town charters, to allow the Crown to dismiss key officials, and to limit the parliamentary franchise to the same officials. In 1684, the previous royal charters of Evesham and Worcester were withdrawn, and Evesham given a new restricted franchise along these lines. King James II issued a new charter to Worcester which was less restrictive than Evesham&#x27;s but allowed him to dismiss council officials.

===King James II and the Glorious Revolution===
Catholic worship became more open during James II&#x27;s rule, and a chapel was established in Worcester near Foregate around 1685. Anti-Catholic riots in the city were narrowly prevented in 1686 outside a private house used for Catholic worship.

In 1688, King James II attempted to remove restrictions on Catholics in public life. These moves were unpopular in Worcestershire as elsewhere. As James II canvassed his support with local officials, those in Worcester were evasive in the responses. By October, the King was forced to placate public disquiet, and restored the rights of cities like Worcester, with the result that the local council dismissed the Mayor and reinstated the previous one. The same council recorded its support for the Prince of Orange in December. In 1689, James visited Worcester as guest of Bishop Thomas as he toured the country. The town council accompanied him on his request to visit the new Catholic chapel, but reportedly refused to enter it.

Bishop Thomas was not among the seven bishops that objected to King James&#x27; Declaration of Indulgence, which aimed at rehabilitating Catholics into public life, along with Protestants outside of the Church of England, but supported their stance. The trial of the bishops led to James being deposed and replaced by William of Orange. Bishop Thomas was among those who refused to give an oath of allegiance to the new jing, on the principle that a regency should govern rather than a new king, while James was alive. A number of other Worcester clergy took the same stance of loyalty to the Stuarts and were removed from the Church as Non-Jurors. John Somers, the lawyer who represented the seven bishops, represented Worcester in the Convention Parliament that confirmed William as king.

During Charles II and James II&#x27;s reigns, strict controls on the press had been maintained. These broke down during the 1689 revolution and were removed in 1695. Around 1690 the &quot;Worcester Post-Man&quot; appears to have been established, from which the &quot;Berrow&#x27;s Journal&quot; claims descent.

==Georgian Worcestershire 1690-1830==
===Georgian society, politics and religion===
The larger and more industrial towns in Worcestershire began to grow and suffer from overcrowding and disease. Infilling of towns within their traditional confines was common, Worcester was particularly densely infilled. Kidderminster extended to accommodate workers in the growing carpet industry. However, the upper and middle classes began to fuel a market in larger brick town houses, often in terraces on new land on the outskirts of towns. These often also included improvements to services such as paving and lighting.

Stourport grew rapidly from a hamlet to a fashionable town after it became the point that the canal network met the River Severn in 1770, and included many town house developments.

Great Malvern&#x27;s growth as a spa town dates to this period, offering water cures, particularly after Dr Wall publicised their efficacy in 1757. Hotels began to accommodate visitors seeking treatments, and a pump room and baths were built in 1823.

====Georgian politics====
While Worcestershire might have been expected to have significant Jacobite sympathies, from its Catholic families and connections with the Stuarts, these do not have appeared to have resulted in much political or religious expression other than the refusal of a significant minority of Church of England clergy to swear allegiance to William of Orange. However, some sign of such views can perhaps be detected in the formation of a Whig &quot;Constitution Club&quot; in Worcester.

 Worcester&#x27;s Bishop William Lloyd was a prominent Whig. In 1710, Henry Sacheverell, a Tory with conservative religious views, who had been imprisoned for preaching against the tolerance of dissenters, travelled through Worcester on his way to Shropshire. Bishop Lloyd attempted to prevent the ringing of church bells in his honour by Worcester&#x27;s residents. When a group of supporters broke into St Nicholas&#x27; Church, they found the bells without clappers and resorted to bashing them with anything iron. This produced a discordant noise, and turned the attempt to greet Sacheverell with honour into something of a farce.

Pressure for political reform built as towns increased in size. Parliamentary representation was increasingly unfair where towns had grown. At the end of the period, Droitwich and Worcester, for instance, had two MPs each, though Worcester was nearly ten times as large. Dudley, which was a similar size to Worcester, had no representation at all. The voting system was also extremely limited and open to corruption. Droitwich had 38 votes cast in 1747, while Bewdley had just 30 or 40 burgesses to elect their MP. Evesham had 555 votes cast in 1818. The low numbers of voters encouraged corruption and electoral challenges. Discontent led to the Priestley Riots in Birmingham in 1791, which included buildings being burnt down in King&#x27;s Norton. The Napoleonic Wars reduced pressures for change, but they re-emerged after their conclusion. Local government suffered similar problems.

The 1815 Corn Law attracted widespread opposition, as it was designed to force the price of bread upwards. In May 1814, a public meeting in Worcester led to a petition being signed by 6,000 people in just two days. Petitions were also raised in Dudley and Droitwich. The following year, 8,000 people signed a second petition in Worcester, this time over an afternoon.

====The landed classes====

 The prosperity of Worcestershire&#x27;s landed classes is attested to by the construction of great houses in this period, which stands in contrast to the decades immediately after the Civil War. Examples include Croome Court, whose gardens were designed by Capability Brown; Hagley Hall; and Hanbury Hall. Around 40 such properties were built or rebuilt in the between 1660 and 1832. Church building also reflected increased wealth, such as the Baroque chapel at Great Witley. They were sustained by rents from tenant farmers, and other incomes. The Foleys at Great Whitley, for instance, had income from their ironworks. Many of these landowners were also politically prominent, such as Thomas Winnington of Stanford-on-Teme.

====Religion====
The Church of England underwent a period of quiet, but this included some church rebuilding and expansion as the population and wealth of the area grew. Churches in Stourbridge, Smethwick, Bewdley and Upton on Severn were rebuilt in 1728 and 1757. At Great Witley, a Baroque Italianate church was built by Thomas Foley in 1735, from iron-making profits.

John Wesley generated new vigour to the Church of England from 1739 onwards, visiting Worcestershire only in 1761 however, preaching to a group in Evesham. Methodist Chapels were established in the 1770s and 1780s, for instance in Worcester and Stourport.

Another group, the Evangelicals, broke away from the established church, building chapels in Cradley, Evesham in 1789 and Birdport in Worcester in 1804-5.

The first Catholic chapel in Worcester since James II&#x27;s reign was opened in 1829, shortly after the Sacramental Test Act 1828 and other legislation removed most of the legal discrimination against Catholics.

====Regulation of poverty====
Bequests to the poor were common in wills. These could be small, for direct distribution, or larger, for the purpose of maintaining almshouses or providing a small income to impoverished individuals over time, for instance through property rents or land.

Poor Relief was levied on people who had sufficient income. It was used to help the poor in their homes (&#x27;out relief&#x27;), on a weekly or occasional basis, to grant clothing or other essentials, or even building repairs. In Belbroughton in 1831, with a population of 1,476, 68 weekly payments were made. Poor relief however was only due to residents of a parish, provable through a certificate of residence. Others could be removed; for instance at Hanley Castle over 110 individuals were removed between 1717 and 1835, and a similar number returned. This often involved the return of pregnant women. In 1830, for example, a woman was returned to Hanley Castle from Bristol after falling pregnant by a shoemaker who was married.

Worcester gained a workhouse in 1703, to deal with a rise in poverty and prevent itinerant beggars. Children found begging would be committed to the workhouse until they could be apprenticed for seven years at age 15.

===Rural Worcestershire===
While agriculture grew, intensified and diversified, bad harvests in this period led to deaths for instance in 1708-12 or high prices in 1800 which led to bread riots in Worcester. Gentry tended to lead the improvements, having the capital to invest. In the 1690s, Thomas Foley introduced water irrigation in Chaddesley Corbett at a cost of £500, quadrupling the value of the meadows.

Worcestershire&#x27;s rural communities changed as manufacturing narrowed craft and small-scale production outside of factories. Additionally, the enclosure movement changed the rights to land and grazing, removing traditional rights, but allowing more commercial exploitation of land. Enclosure began with Royal Forests, including Malvern Chase and Feckenham Forest in the seventeenth century, and continued slowly in the early to mid eighteenth century. 

Enclosure sped up greatly in the reign of George III, in the period 1760-1820. By the end of this process, nearly all common land in the county was enclosed, representing around a fifth of the land in county. As elsewhere, this tended to cause a shift away from arable production to more lucrative grazing. While the commercial benefits may have been clear for landowners, the effect on independent small farmers was not fully compensated for. The result was that many enclosures caused riots, such as the disturbances at Leigh in 1778, where anti-enclosure rioters attacked the physical enclosure: 
Arable, mostly wheat, farming was found throughout Worcestershire but was dominant in the south. Fodder for animals increased, such as hay, clover and peas. The Vale of Evesham produced vegetables, corn, cheese and butter, and increased horticulture. Hops were grown in the Teme valley particularly, and accounted for nearly 6,000 acres of production in 1794. Hop markets were held in several towns, most importantly at Worcester. Perry was produced for instance at Newland.

Grain production increased in north east Worcestershire, due to new production techniques.

===Manufacturing industries===
As noted above, metal and other manufacturing industries gradually built up in Worcestershire through the seventeenth century, especially in the north of the county. Glass manufacturing, iron smelting and coal mining were all well established before 1700.

Iron production with coal from the South Staffordshire coalfield, which extends into Worcestershire, took off in 1772, with the construction of an ironworks by John Wilkinson near Dudley. There were 14 on the coalfield by 1794 producing 13,000 tons of cast iron a year. The increased production of iron in turn caused the growth of the nailmaking and needle industries in the north of county.

 By the 1831 census, 2,751 people were engaged in nailmaking in Worcestershire, primarily in Bromsgrove, Dudley and Northfield. The industry was prone to low wages. Nailmakers, who supplied iron rods for manufacture and bought nails back, were able to exploit their labourers greatly through control of rents, along with middle men making loans through &#x27;truck&#x27; systems. This led to hardship and strikes.

Needle-makers concentrated along the River Arrow, particularly Redditch, which also specialised in springs and hooks. The process of scouring and sharpening needles caused metal dust to enter the lungs, at great cost to the health of workers.

Many traditional industries such as tanning, milling and brewing continued through the county, but the cloth trade went into decine, out competed by industries in Gloucestershire and Yorkshire among others. Cap-making survived in Bewdley, however, and weavers in Kidderminster found new employment in carpet manufacturing. The first carpet factory opened there in 1735. Skills and techniques were brought in from Brussels, to compete with high quality manufacturers from elsewhere in the United Kingdom such as Axminster and Wilton. By 1807, there were 1,000 looms in Kidderminster. Poor trade conditions in the late 1820s however, when 2,000 looms were not working for an 18 week period, in 1828, led to riots where £3,000 of damage was done during one night.

Glass-making in Stourbridge grew in the 1700s, at first being known for coloured window glass. In 1780, techniques allegedly stolen from German manufacturers meant that the trade in cut and crystal glass developed.

 Bone china and porcelain production started in Worcester in 1751, using clay imported from Cornwall. It specialised in the use of transfer printing, which was cheaper and easier than hand painting. The Worcester Royal Porcelain Company gained its name and extended its sales by persuading George III to visit in 1788, and then opened a sales outlet in London, aimed at the luxury market.

Workers in Worcester who suffered from the decline of the cloth trade shifted production to leather gloves. The Napoleonic Wars allowed the industry to thrive, as French imports were halted. Leather was cut in factories, and then finished in homes by women and children. Factories were established in Sidbury including those of John Dent and George Allen. The industry suffered once trade with France was reestablished however, particularly in exports to the USA.

===Transportation===
Equally as important were improvements to roads and navigation, so that goods could be transported and sold. The River Severn was navigable up to Bewdley, toll-free as Government prevented local government from imposing charges. In the seventeenth century, the Avon and Stour were made navigable. However, it was in the later eighteenth century that great improvements were made, as canals opened trade across Worcestershire and the Midlands.

In 1771, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal opened, aiming to join the Severn and Trent rivers. It was originally intended to link with the Severn at Bewdley, but opted for Stourport because of opposition, causing Stourport to rapidly expand from less than a village to a major and fashionable town. The Droitwich Canal opened at a similar time, and work began to set up the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. Opposition from landowners to this was fierce, but Parliament&#x27;s permission in 1791 was greeted with celebrations in Worcester. Nevertheless, it was not particularly profitable.

==Victorian and Edwardian Worcestershire: 1830–1914==
The population of the county rose rapidly, from 220,000 in the 1831 census to 488,355 in 1901. Infant mortality was high during most of the century, and outbreaks of epidemics remained common. Housing was particularly bad in the industrial areas, especially Dudley. Health Inspector William Lee reported in 1851 that &quot;In no other part of England and Wales is the work of human extermination effected in so short a time as … in Dudley&quot;.
Small towns in the county tended to stagnate or shrink slightly in size, such as Alvechurch, Bewdley, Broadway, Pershore, Tenbury and Upton on Severn. The larger towns including Bromsgrove, Droitwich, Evesham and Worcester roughly doubled in size. In the north of the county, however, the industrial towns grew vastly in places such as Halesowen, Dudley and Yardley.

Spa towns were formed. Great Malvern quadrupled due its promotion as a spa town. Tenbury Wells, however, failed to capture similar success after a pump room was built in 1840. In the 1880s, John Corbett invested salt profits from Stoke Works into spa facilities and hotels in Droitwich, opening St Andrew&#x27;s Brine baths in 1887. However, Droitwch did not capture the same growth as Malvern, perhaps because it did not have the same appeal from the hills and walks at Malvern.

===Politics===
Rejection of the Reform Bill in 1831 led to a riot in Worcester. The mayor was hit by a stone thrown by the rioters, and called in the Hussars to suppress the disturbance. The disturbances were directed however not just at the lack of parliamentary reform, but also at the dissatisfaction with local government, which was still operating as a system of self-appointed town burgesses electing councils in Bewdley, Droitwich, Evesham, Kidderminster and Worcester.

Protests against the high bread prices caused by the Corn Laws and political reform could combine. In 1842, a meeting in Worcester passed a resolution making the point that a representative Parliament would never have backed the Corn Laws. The Worcester Mayor prevented the full meeting from backing a motion in support of the 1838 People&#x27;s Charter which called for universal male suffrage.

Reaction to the political defeat of Chartism in the early 1840s led to a movement to liberate the working people through ownership of land holdings. Subscriptions were set up to fund small villages of Chartists with land holdings; two of these were in Worcestershire, in Dodford and at Lowbands, Redmarley d&#x27;Abitot. The scheme however was not sustainable and was wound up as a Ponzi scheme by Parliament.

The Municipal Reform Act 1835 created a system of elected mayors, aldermen and councillors. The franchise was restricted by a property qualification and to men. In Droitwich, the town clerk resisted the changes by refusing to hand over documents to the new authority. Other towns were granted new borough administrations, although this was a slow process; being granted many decades later in Dudley (1865) and Stourbridge (1914). Bromsgrove&#x27;s town was made an urban district in 1858.

Nevertheless, political corruption persisted in Worcester throughout the century. Votes were bought through simple bribes, for instance of money or beer, which were seen by some poorer people as an important supplement to their meagre incomes. Extension of voting rights made such bribery very expensive. Despite the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883 that made these activities clearly illegal, the practices continued and were investigated by a royal commission in 1906, which found that around 500 people in Worcester continued to sell their votes, at this stage to the Conservative Party. The investigation, which was prompted by the Liberal Party, dented the liberal vote for many years after as a result.

Town and municipal facilities improved in the period. New town halls were built and gas street lighting installed. Libraries and institutes were built especially in the later 1800s and public parks created.

===Education===
Efforts to provide education were driven by national legislation. Localities had often supplied free education to the poor through endowments, but this was fractured and far from universal. The Church of England National Society began to provide voluntary educational facilities, and after the Education Act 1870, the gaps began to be plugged through local school boards. Schooling became compulsory in 1880. Some of the older grammar schools reformed their management. After the Education Act 1902 local authorities began to open secondary schools.

Independent schools were also established, such as Malvern College in 1865 and St Michael&#x27;s College in Tenbury in 1856.

Technical education developed through Mechanics Institutes, for instance leading to Worcester&#x27;s School of Art and Science being opened in the 1890s.

===The Poor laws===
The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 required that parishes pool their resources to support the poor in unions under the supervision of boards of guardians. This established new workhouses across Worcestershire. For instance, 34 parishes around Pershore built a workhouse for 200 paupers, initially providing work breaking stones. By 1894, 11 unions across Worcestershire provided for 7,228 people in workhouses, such as the Martley Poor Law Union. Punishments for infractions could be harsh.

===Religion and church building===
With the rising population and wealth of the county, many Anglican churches were built, rebuilt or restored, driven on the Oxford High Church movement of the 1840s and the evangelical movement. Particular effort was made to deepen the work of the church in the industrial and now heavily populated north of Worcestershire. Worcester Cathedral&#x27;s exterior and windows were also restored. New churches were built, often in the Gothic style, including the work of several nationally known architects.

Nonconformists also grew their chapels, which began to look more like churches than meeting halls. Catholic churches began to be built, as the result of the repeal of restrictions in 1829. At Hanley Swan, the Church of Our Lady and St Alphonsus was built by descendants of Thomas Hornyold who had aided Charles II&#x27;s escape. In general, the continuing Catholic connections of the county meant that new churches were established with greater funding than in many other parts of the country.

===Industry===
Industry dominated the northern parts of the county, in what was by then known as the Black Country. Coal mining took place on the edge of the Staffordshire coalfield around Dudley, Stourbridge and Netherton; most were shallow mines at under 60 feet deep. The coal was soft and unsuitable for most industrial uses. Nevertheless, in the Dudley area, annual production was around 700,000 tons, employing 2,500 people. Another area around the Wyre Forest also produced coal, but at a lower quality from thin seams. Ironstone was also mined extensively but was of low iron content. Ore was brought in from other areas.

The iron industries in the northern area produced chains, anvils and many kinds of tools. Nail making predominated in some areas including Bromsgrove. Scythe-making in Belbroughton continued but declined.

In Kidderminister in 1838, 24 carpet manufacturers controlled around 2,000 looms. These were lent to workers who worked them in their own homes. Over the course of the century, the practice changed so that they were worked in factories. in 1841, 138 needle and fish hook makers could be found in Worcestershire, the vast majority in the Redditch area.

Droitwich continued to produce salt, and workings were extended to Stoke Prior, extracting salt through copper rods at a depth of 200 feet.

In Worcester, the Royal Porcelain Company faced competition and tried to counter it by moving to more specialist production such as biscuit ware. A similar pattern could be seen in the glove industry, which by 1851 employed around 2,500 glovemakers, much less than in its heyday. These were mostly working at home; these jobs moved to factories over the century with the introduction of new sewing machinery.

Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce began to be made and bottled in Worcester around 1837, first produced by two chemists, it is claimed according to a recipe supplied by an unnamed &quot;Nobleman of the County&quot;. Production expanded, and a new factory was opened at the Midland Road on 16 October 1897, which accommodated exports to the USA.

====Transportation====
The navigability of the River Severn was improved by new locks after an act of Parliament of 1842. Roads also improved through investment from the turnpike trust system, which also enabled the stage coach network, for instance connecting Worcester with Liverpool in eleven hours from 1832.

With the advent of steam power, mass transportation of goods moved from canals to rail. Railways progressed more slowly in Worcestershire than in other parts of the country. The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was opened in 1840, but did not pass through Worcester due to the opposition of landlords. The route was controversial due to its route through the Lickey Hills, involving the very steep and long Lickey Incline.

Worcester was connected to the rail network ten years later, and gained a route to London in 1852. The north of Worcestershire was the mostly closely connected by the rail network, due to the predominance of iron, steel, coal and other industries.

The arrival of the railways was often a cause of great celebrations; a breakfast, carnival and ball was organised in Tenbury Wells in 1864 when it was connected to the Kidderminster line. The benefits could be enormous: at Great Malvern in 1861, the line from Worcester brought 3,000 visitors in the first twelve months of its operation.

===Agriculture===
The 1830s and 40s were particularly difficult for rural Worcestershire, due to high prices imposed by the Corn Laws. The 1850s and 60s were much more prosperous, due to demand from the towns. Bad harvests in the 1870s were followed by cheap food imports from the USA.

Wheat was the main crop in Worcestershire, but declined after the 1870s. Beans and potatoes were more important than in previous periods, and dairy products increased production, leading to a 40% growth in pasture lands. The Vale of Evesham, supplying fresh vegetables to Birmingham by rail, grew in prosperity and population, in marked contrast to the static or declining rural population elsewhere. Strawberries were grown from the 1870s. Asparagus, rhubarb and salads were other common crops.

Hop production also expanded by around 50% in 1874–1901, especially in the Teme valley. Wire frames replaced poles, and the use of insecticide and pesticide sprays enabled this growth in supply. However, foreign supplies caused protests against dumping in 1908.

Sales of produce and livestock through regular markets or &#x27;fairs&#x27; was especially significant. Worcester and Bromsgrove had a monthly fair. Evesham held a wool fair on 14 August, and Stourbridge had a five day horse fair in late March. Livestock markets were gradually moved onto specific sites because of the disturbance they caused. Many towns also built dedicated corn exchanges, such as that in Angel Street in Worcester.

===Rural society===
Villages in this period sustained their own shops and crafts, for instance a blacksmith, who would make repairs and shoe horses, joiners and carpenters. Day labourers would supply horses and carts. Corn mills were also extremely important for local production of flour. Local traditions such as Maypole dressing, the Hartlebury Wake of St James, &#x27;Thomasing&#x27; (where old women would beg for alms on St Thomas&#x27;s day) were common.

Pubs were a focal point for communities. Beer production was a big part of the local economy. One result was that alcoholism was also a problem. Over time, local authorities began to restrict the numbers of pubs. Village sports grew in the period, particularly through formation of local football and cricket clubs in the 1880s and 90s.

Large estate houses dominated rural parishes, as centres of authority and employment. Hagley Hall, for instance, employed 21 resident servants and a governess, for the Lyttleton&#x27;s family of ten and their guests. Their owners increasingly included families that had made their fortunes in industry; often they sought out country residences as a way to signal their status and achievement. Witley Court was bought by the heir to the Dudley&#x27;s, William Ward, who let the house to rich tenants, including Queen Adelaide in 1844-46.

Houses were built and extended, many in the Gothic style, such as Madresfield Court near Great Malvern, which includes an Arts and Crafts chapel interior. Astley Hall was built in a Jacobean style in the 1830s and Bricklehampton Hall in an Italiante style in 1848. Chateau Impney near Droitwich was built by salt magnate John Corbett for his French wife.

==Twentieth century, 1914-2000==
The twentieth century saw further rises of population, but also a slowing of the pace of growth. Rural population density was higher in the north than the south and west. Industries shifted away from manufacturing, declining from 40% of jobs in Worcestershire 1931 to 25% across Hereford and Worcester by 1980. Services were the dominant employers even at the start of period, with 45% of full time jobs in 1931, to 60% in 1980. Only 5% of the population were in agricultural work, although it remained dominant in land use. Female employment increased, but two thirds of full time jobs were held by men in 1980.

Heavy industries were dominant in the early part of the century. Metals and engineering dominated the north of county, in Dudley, Halesown, Oldbury and Stourbridge. Carpet manufacturing dominated Kidderminister. The glove industry in Worcester was already in decline, but still contributed to employment at the start of the period. Dents, the main employer, left Worcester in the 1930s.

Worcester continued to develop metal industries in the period. Bromsgrove gained a major drop forge plant, Garringtons, after the Second World War.

Commuting became a regular feature of work in the county. By 1961, for instance, in Halesown, half of the employees travelled outside of the borough for work, and nearly a quarter to Birmingham.

Mixed farming continued to be important across the county, and fruit and market vegetables dominated in the Vale of Evesham. Hop production in the Teme Valley declined as beer production patterns centralised, and moved towards lager.

===Great War===
Worcester was a centre for recruitment of soldiers to fight in the First World War, into the Worcestershire Regiment, which was based at Norton Barracks. The regiment took part in early battles in the war, most notably at the Battle of Gheluvelt in October 1914, which prevented the German army from reaching Belgian ports.

The newly-appointed Vicar of St Paul&#x27;s in Worcester, Geoffrey Studdert Kennedy, was among those urging men to enlist. He became an army chaplain, later known as &#x27;Woodbine Willy&#x27;, as he brought cigarettes to soldiers during fighting and exposed himself to physical danger, earning him a Military Cross. Shops in Worcester organised collections to supply him with cigarettes. His experience of war ushed him towards pacifism and Christian Socialism. After the war, he left his Worcester parish, but kept a house in the city for the rest of his life.

===Second World War===
===Post war Worcestershire===

===Boundary changes===
The county underwent further boundary changes. In 1966, parts of Birmingham were brought together with Worcestershire into Warley. This area stayed within the county until 1974.

===Hereford and Worcester===
In 1974 the county was merged with Herefordshire to form a large single administrative county of Hereford and Worcester which in 1998 was reverted to the original historical counties. Some changes in borders occurred with some areas such as Halesowen, Stourbridge, and the exclave of Dudley, which used to be part of northern Worcestershire becoming part of West Midlands metropolitan county. Yardley had already been made part of Birmingham in the county of Warwickshire. The post-1998 county, therefore, does not correspond exactly to the pre-1974 boundaries.

<text>Palazzo San Gervasio (Lucano: ) is a small agricultural town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Potenza, in the Southern Italian region of Basilicata. It is bounded by the comuni (Municipalities) of Acerenza, Banzi, Forenza, Genzano di Lucania, Maschito, Spinazzola, and Venosa.

While the regional Lucanian dialect is still spoken amongst the older inhabitants, it has largely been replaced because the younger generations have been taught the standard form of Italian in school.

The town was allegedly founded in the early Middle Ages, after the nearby town of Banzi was destroyed by a Saracen attack.

<doc id="1139926" wikidata="Q3235577" url="?curid=1139926" title="Hyperbolic sector">
<text>A hyperbolic sector is a region of the Cartesian plane bounded by a hyperbola and two rays from the origin to it. For example, the two points and on the rectangular hyperbola , or the corresponding region when this hyperbola is re-scaled and its orientation is altered by a rotation leaving the center at the origin, as with the unit hyperbola. A hyperbolic sector in standard position has and .

Hyperbolic sectors are the basis for the hyperbolic functions.

==Area==

The area of a hyperbolic sector in standard position is natural logarithm of &quot;b&quot; .

Proof: Integrate under 1/&quot;x&quot; from 1 to &quot;b&quot;, add triangle {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)}, and subtract triangle {(0, 0), (&quot;b&quot;, 0), (&quot;b&quot;, 1/&quot;b&quot;)} (both triangles of which have the same area).
When in standard position, a hyperbolic sector corresponds to a positive hyperbolic angle at the origin, with the measure of the latter being defined as the area of the former.

==Hyperbolic triangle==
When in standard position, a hyperbolic sector determines a hyperbolic triangle, the right triangle with one vertex at the origin, base on the diagonal ray &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, and third vertex on the hyperbola 
:formula_1

with the hypotenuse being the segment from the origin to the point (&quot;x, y&quot;) on the hyperbola. The length of the base of this triangle is 
:formula_2
and the altitude is 
:formula_3 
where &quot;u&quot; is the appropriate hyperbolic angle. The usual definitions of the hyperbolic functions can be seen via the legs of right triangles plotted with hyperbolic coordinates. When the length of theses legs is divided by the square root of 2, they can be graphed as the unit hyperbola with hyperbolic cosine and sine coordinates.

The analogy between circular and hyperbolic functions was described by Augustus De Morgan in his &quot;Trigonometry and Double Algebra&quot; (1849). William Burnside used such triangles, projecting from a point on the hyperbola &quot;xy&quot; = 1 onto the main diagonal, in his article &quot;Note on the addition theorem for hyperbolic functions&quot;.

==Hyperbolic logarithm==
It is known that f(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; has an algebraic antiderivative except in the case &quot;p&quot; = –1 corresponding to the quadrature of the hyperbola. The other cases are given by Cavalieri&#x27;s quadrature formula. Whereas quadrature of the parabola had been accomplished by Archimedes in the third century BC (in &quot;The Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;), the hyperbolic quadrature required the invention in 1647 of a new function: Gregoire de Saint-Vincent addressed the problem of computing the areas bounded by a hyperbola. His findings led to the natural logarithm function, once called the hyperbolic logarithm since it is obtained by integrating, or finding the area, under the hyperbola.

Before 1748 and the publication of Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite, the natural logarithm was known in terms of the area of a hyperbolic sector. Leonhard Euler changed that when he introduced transcendental functions such as 10x. Euler identified e as the value of &quot;b&quot; producing a unit of area (under the hyperbola or in a hyperbolic sector in standard position). Then the natural logarithm could be recognized as the inverse function to the transcendental function ex.

To accommodate the case of negative logarithms and the corresponding negative hyperbolic angles, different hyperbolic sectors are constructed according to whether &quot;x&quot; is greater or less than one. A variable right triangle with area 1/2 is formula_4 The isosceles case is formula_5 The natural logarithm is known as the area under &quot;y&quot; = 1/&quot;x&quot; between one and &quot;x&quot;. A positive hyperbolic angle is given by the area of 
formula_6 A negative hyperbolic angle is given by the &quot;negative&quot; of the area formula_7 This convention is in accord with a negative natural logarithm for &quot;x&quot; in (0,1).

==Hyperbolic geometry==

When Felix Klein&#x27;s book on non-Euclidean geometry was published in 1928, it provided a foundation for the subject by reference to projective geometry. To establish hyperbolic measure on a line, Klein noted that the area of a hyperbolic sector provided visual illustration of the concept.

Hyperbolic sectors can also be drawn to the hyperbola formula_8. The area of such hyperbolic sectors has been used to define hyperbolic distance in a geometry textbook.

<text>Olea ( ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It includes 12 species native to warm temperate and tropical regions of the Middle East, southern Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and Australasia. They are evergreen trees and shrubs, with small, opposite, entire leaves. The fruit is a drupe. Leaves of &quot;Olea&quot; contain trichosclereids.

For humans, the most important and familiar species is by far the olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;), native to the Mediterranean region, Africa, southwest Asia, and the Himalayas, which is the type species of the genus. The native olive (&quot;O. paniculata&quot;) is a larger tree, attaining a height of 15–18 m in the forests of Queensland, and yielding a hard and tough timber. The yet harder wood of the black ironwood &quot;O. capensis&quot;, an inhabitant of Natal, is important in South Africa.

&quot;Olea&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including double-striped pug.

<text>Todd-AO is an American post-production company founded in 1953 by Mike Todd and Robert Naify, providing sound-related services to the motion picture and television industries. The company retains one facility, in the Los Angeles area.

Todd-AO is also the name of the widescreen, 70 mm film format that was developed by Mike Todd and the Naify brothers, owners of United Artists Theaters in partnership with the American Optical Company in the mid-1950s. Todd-AO had been founded to promote and distribute this system.

==History==
Todd-AO began as a high resolution widescreen film format. It was co-developed in the early 1950s by Mike Todd, a Broadway producer, and United Artists Theaters in partnership with the American Optical Company in Buffalo, New York. It was developed to provide a high definition single camera widescreen process to compete with Cinerama, or as characterized by its creator, &quot;Cinerama outta one hole.&quot; Where Cinerama used a complicated setup of three separate strips of film photographed simultaneously, Todd-AO required only a single camera and lens.

The company&#x27;s focus began to shift after Mike Todd&#x27;s sudden death in an airplane accident in 1958. The 70 mm Todd-AO process was adopted by Panavision, Cinerama and others. As the production and exhibition markets became saturated with Todd-AO System hardware, the focus of the company gradually began to narrow to the audio post-production side of the business, and Todd-AO became an independent sound mixing facility for commercial motion picture films and television after acquiring Glen Glenn Sound in 1986.

In May 2014, Todd-AO&#x27;s parent company, Todd Soundelux, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the company closed its Hollywood and Santa Monica facilities, leaving only their Burbank location operational.

On November 17, 2014, Sounddogs acquired the Todd-Soundelux Trademarks (Todd AO and Soundelux) and Copyrights (Sound Effects Library) through Federal Bankruptcy Court (Central District Case No. 2:14-bk-19980).

===Todd-AO process ===
The Todd-AO process uses two separate film stocks; a 65 mm negative is used during production and then used to produce the 70 mm positives for distribution. The sprocket hole perforations on the two are the same, and the positives are printed using contact printing with the negatives centered on the larger 70 mm film. Contact printing was used on prints that were to be &quot;double system&quot;, using a separate, synchronized 35 mm full-coat magnetic film for the 6 sound tracks, in addition to the 70 mm film for the picture. The much more common 70 mm release prints used a slightly optically reduced picture, and placed four of the soundtracks on either edge outside of the perforations, and two more soundtracks inside the perforations, providing a total of six soundtracks, on a 7.5 mm magnetic surface. Todd-AO soundtracks were very high fidelity, and could still compete with modern digital tracks above 40 kHz. Even though there were no subwoofers in theaters in those days, Todd-AO delivered high-impact bass using crisp-sounding horn-loaded speakers. Four lens options covered a 128, 64, 48 or 37 degree field of view. The aspect ratio of this format was 2.20:1.
Both film sizes had been used in the past, in the 70 mm Fox Grandeur process in 1929–1930, but Todd-AO&#x27;s physical format was not compatible with this format. The use of 65 mm photography and 70 mm printing became the standard adopted by others: Super Panavision 70 (essentially the Panavision company&#x27;s version of Todd-AO) and Ultra Panavision 70 (the same mechanically, but with a slight 1.25:1 anamorphic squeeze to accommodate extremely wide aspect ratio images) are both 65/70 processes. The Soviet film industry also copied Todd-AO with their own Sovscope 70 process, identical, except that both the camera and print stock were 70 mm wide.

The IMAX format also uses 65 mm camera and lab film to create 70 mm prints for projection (also known as the 65/70 mm process); conforming to the pitch and perforation standard for 70 mm Todd-AO film. However, the IMAX frame is 15 perfs long and runs horizontally through the projector, whereas the Todd-AO frame is only 5 perfs high and runs vertically through the projector.

The original version of the Todd-AO process used a frame rate of 30 frames per second, faster than the 24 frames per second that was (and is) the standard. The difference does not seem great, but the sensitivity of the human eye to flickering declines steeply with frame rate and the small adjustment gave the film noticeably less flicker, and made it steadier and smoother than standard processes. The original system generated an image that was &quot;almost twice as intense as any ever seen onscreen before, and so hot that the film has to be cooled as it passes through the Todd-AO projector&quot;.

Only the first two Todd-AO films, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, employed 30 frames per second photography. Because of the need for conventional versions at 24 frames per second, every scene of the former film was shot twice in succession: once in Todd-AO and once in 35 mm CinemaScope. The latter film was shot with two 65 mm Todd-AO cameras simultaneously, the speed of the second camera was 24 frames per second for wide release as optical reduction prints. All subsequent Todd-AO films were shot at 24 frames per second on a 65 mm negative and optically printed to 35 mm film as needed for standard distribution. In all, around 16 feature films were shot in Todd-AO.

Todd-AO was developed and tested in Buffalo, New York, at the Regent Theatre. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II went there to see Todd-AO test footage, which led them to approve its use for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Ampex Corporation engineers were in charge of developing the Todd-AO sound system. Ampex would later go on to manufacture the sound system, including selectable four-track composite (CinemaScope), six-track composite (Todd-AO), four-track interlocked, six-track interlocked or optical sound sources.

The Todd-AO Company also offered a 35 mm anamorphic process technically similar to 35 mm Panavision or CinemaScope. This may cause some confusion if a Todd-AO credit (not necessarily the more specific Todd-AO 35 credit) appears in some widescreen films made in the 1970s and 1980s. It becomes even more confusing as 70 mm prints were made for films which, unlike earlier pictures made in the process, were shown in multiplexes, like &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;.

During the late 1970s through the early 1990s, 65 mm photography such as that used in processes like Todd-AO or Super Panavision became rare. However, some major films had 70 mm prints made by blowup from 35 mm negatives mostly for the benefit of six-track sound. These prints would typically play only in a few theatres in a few large cities while everyone else viewed the film in 35 mm. The advent of multichannel digital sound in the 1990s obviated these very expensive prints. &quot;Blow-up&quot; 70 mm prints also followed the Todd-AO layout, although in the case of films made with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, it was retained in the 70 mm version, with the sides of the 70 mm frame left black.

===Curved screen vs. flat===
While Todd-AO was intended to be &quot;Cinerama out of one hole&quot;, the extreme wide-angle photography and projection onto a very deeply curved screen (which is what that would imply) saw little use. Most Todd-AO theatre installations had only moderately curved screens and the extreme wide-angle camera lenses were used only on a few shots here and there. Todd-AO films made after 1958 used a conventional flat widescreen, and resembled ordinary films, except for their greater clarity and six-track stereo sound. A variation on Todd-AO called Dimension 150 did, however, make use of Cinerama-like deeply curved screens. Only two films were made in Dimension 150 – &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot;, directed by John Huston, and &quot;Patton&quot;, starring George C. Scott. In some venues, however, Todd-AO and Dimension 150 films received their first run in Cinerama theatres in order that they be shown on a deeply curved screen – such as the first Atlanta showings of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

===Todd-AO and roadshows===
Todd-AO films were closely associated with what was called roadshow exhibition. At the time, before multiplex theatres became common, most films opened at a large single screen theatre in the downtown area of each large city before eventually moving on to neighborhood theatres. With the roadshow concept, a film would play, often in 70 mm at a movie palace downtown theatre exclusively, sometimes for a year or more. Often a &quot;hard ticket&quot; policy was in effect, with tickets sold for specific numbered seats, and limited showings per day. Most Todd-AO films through the late 1960s, including &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, were initially shown on a roadshow basis.

In some US cities, individual theaters were converted for use in the 1950s as dedicated Todd-AO &quot;Cinestage&quot; showplaces. These theaters showed exclusive roadshow engagements of Todd-AO and other 70 mm films on large, deeply curved screens. They included the Rivoli Theatre in New York City, the Cinestage Theatre in Chicago and Hunt&#x27;s Cinestage Theatre in Columbus, Ohio.

The roadshow era ended in the early 1970s, although a very few films (among them &quot;Gandhi&quot;) were shown in roadshow format after that.

===Todd-AO 35===
In the 1970s, under the leadership of Dr. Richard Vetter, Todd-AO made an attempt to compete with Panavision in the 35 mm motion picture camera rental market. The company built a series of anamorphic lenses in the 2.35:1 scope format, and owned several camera bodies (Mitchell and Arriflex) that they would provide with the lens package. Films produced in Todd-AO 35 include &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, &quot;Mad Max&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;.

By the mid 1980s the venture was moribund, and was abandoned. Eventually all of the Todd-AO cameras and lenses, both 35 mm and 65 mm (70 mm), were sold to Cinema Products in Los Angeles. The 35mm anamorphic lenses are now in the rental inventory of Keslow Camera.

<text>Mevaseret Zion () is a town and local council located to the west of Jerusalem, straddling both sides of the Jerusalem–Tel Aviv highway. Mevaseret Zion is composed of two distinct older townships, Maoz Zion and Mevaseret Yerushalayim, under the jurisdiction of one local council. The newer neighborhoods of Mevaseret Zion were not part of either settlement.

Mevaseret Zion is located on a mountain ridge above sea level, on the outskirts of Jerusalem. In it had a population of 24,409, spread over 15 neighborhoods. It is the wealthiest municipality per capita in the Jerusalem District. Mevaseret Zion&#x27;s current mayor is Yoram Shimon.

==History==
===Castel area===

Due to its strategic location, settlement in the area of Mevasseret Zion goes back to antiquity. The Romans built a fortress there, known as Castellum. On the ruins of this fortress, the Crusaders built a castle, Castellum Belveer, of which no trace remains. Belveer is mentioned in a letter from Eraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, dated September 1187, in which he describes the slaughter of Christians &quot;by the sword of Mafumetus the Unbeliever and his evil worshipper Saladin&quot; and the Arab conquest of the town, which was renamed al-Qastal.

During the British Mandate of Palestine, the British referred to this district as &quot;The Castle&quot;. The Arabs called it &quot;al-Qastal&quot;, pronouncing the &quot;t.&quot; The Jews called it &quot;HaCástel&quot; (&quot;the Cástel&quot;).

In the 1948 Palestine war, battles took place here as Arabs and Jews fought for control of al-Qastal, which overlooked the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Al-Qastal exchanged hands several times in the course of the fighting. The tides turned when the Arab commander Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was killed. Many of the Arabs left their positions to attend al-Husayni&#x27;s funeral at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Friday, April 9. That same day, al-Qastal fell to the Yishuv forces, virtually unopposed.
===Maoz Zion===
Maoz Zion (&quot;Stronghold of Zion&quot;) was established in 1951 to house new immigrants from Iraq, Kurdistan, North Africa and Iran who had been living in a ma&#x27;abara, or transit camp, at the foot of the Castel hill. Many were employed at the nearby Solel Boneh stone quarry.

===Mevasseret Yerushalayim===
Mevasseret Yerushalayim was established east of Ma&#x27;oz Zion in 1956 by Jewish immigrants from North Africa. It was located on a ridge near the armistice line, north of Motza. The residents worked in the fruit orchards in the Arazim Valley.

===Unified local council===
In 1963, Maoz Zion and Mevasseret Yerushalayim formed a joint local council, which was called &quot;Mevasseret Zion&quot;. The source of the name is the Book of Isaiah: &quot;&quot; – &quot;Ascend a lofty mountain, O herald of joy to Zion&quot; ().

==Institutions and landmarks==
The Har&#x27;el shopping mall is located at the entrance to Mevasseret Zion, near the Har&#x27;el interchange. The mall serves the residents of Mevasseret Zion, Maoz Zion, the surrounding communities, as well as travelers on Route 1. The shopping mall which includes some 80 businesses has been joined by the Jerusalem Mall on the other side of the highway at the entrance of Maoz Zion.The world&#x27;s first kosher McDonald&#x27;s opened there in 1995.
In addition to numerous Orthodox congregations, Mevasseret Zion also has a Reform congregation, Kehillat Mevasseret Zion, founded in 1993.

<text>East Side San Jose (abbreviated as ESSJ), commonly called The East Side and less commonly as the East Valley, is the eastern region of the city of San Jose, California. The East Side is made up of numerous neighborhoods grouped into two larger districts: Alum Rock and Evergreen. East San Jose is bordered by the Diablo Range to the east and south, the Coyote Creek to the west, and Mabury Road to the North.

East San Jose is one of the city&#x27;s most diverse regions, home to landmarks such as the historic Chicano/Mexican-American neighborhoods of Mayfair and King &amp; Story, as well as the Gurdwara Sahib of San Jose, the largest Sikh temple in the world outside of India.

==History==

<text>The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror is a 2004 novel by American writer Christopher Moore. Set during Christmas, it brings together several favored characters from his previous books set in the fictional town of Pine Cove, a recurring location in Moore&#x27;s novels.

An unabridged commercial compact disc recording of the original edition of &quot;The Stupidest Angel&quot; was issued with narration by Tony Roberts. In 2005 the novel won the Quill Award in the category of Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror.

In 2005, Moore released &quot;The Stupidest Angel, Version 2.0&quot;, the text of which remains unchanged from that of the 2004 edition, with the addition of a short story at the end taking place one year after the events of the novel.

==Plot summary==
An angel named Raziel (previously in Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;) is sent to Earth to grant the wish of a child; he decides to help a boy who had witnessed the death of a man dressed as Santa Claus. Meanwhile, the town is preparing for a community dinner-gathering at the local church, near the cemetery. In his inept attempt to bring &quot;Santa&quot; back to life, the angel causes the townspeople to fall under siege by brain-hungry zombies who arise from their burial plots.

==Links to Moore&#x27;s other works==
The story takes place in Pine Cove, setting of &quot;Practical Demonkeeping&quot; and &quot;The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove&quot;. Tucker Case, helicopter pilot for the DEA, and his pet fruitbat, Roberto, appeared in &quot;Island of the Sequined Love Nun&quot;. The angel mentioned in the title, Raziel, appeared in &quot;&quot;. And Sam Applebaum mentions his rastafarian cousin Preston who lives in Maui, who was seen in &quot;Fluke&quot; and &quot;Bite Me: A Love Story&quot;.

The title is a play on the title of the 1946 book &quot;The Littlest Angel&quot; by Charles Tazewell, which has been adapted several times by Hollywood.

The main characters are: Theo Crowe, Molly Michion, Raziel, Lena Marquez, Tucker Case, Gabe Fenton, and Dale Pearson. Some of these characters are seen on other Christopher Moore(s) books.

==Reception==
In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Keith Brooke praised it as &quot;[p]acy and engaging&quot;, and &quot;crammed with sharp and funny one-liners&quot;, while &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called it &quot;enough to make even the most cynical Scrooge guffaw.&quot;

At Tor.com, Mari Ness found it to &quot;not be quite as heartwarming as its cover suggests, or, for that matter, as terrifying&quot;, but nonetheless recommended it as &quot;an antidote to endless Christmas cheer.&quot;

<text>San Zeno Naviglio (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, Lombardy. It is bounded by communes of Brescia, Borgosatollo, Flero and Poncarale.

It is located 6 km south of Brescia.

==History==

Human settlements in the area date back to the Roman Empire (Roman tombstone near the Cascina Pontevica) and Lombards dominion. The first documented town was established in the 15th century; the locality was called Tregonzo or Tregoncio which derives from Latin &quot;Inter Gurgites&quot;.

Under the Venetian Republic (15th and 18th century, the town was organized in the Quadra of Mairano in 1483, then it passed to the Quadra of Bagnolo. It was occupied by the army from Milan during the war of Ferrara.

In the ephemeral Napoleonic &quot;Repubblica di Brescia&quot; (1797), the commune belonged to the &quot;Cantone della Garza Orientale&quot;. During the Napoleonic dominion, the commune was abolited: town was administrated by Brescia directly. In 1814, Austrians restored the municipality autonomy. In 1881 during an administrative reform of the Kingdom of Italy, the commune was renamed San Zeno Naviglio.

In 1817, a bridge was constructed near the &quot;Sörèc&quot; zone (1817). In 1866, the Brescia–Cremona railway was opened along with its railway station. In 1893, the railway construction opened a link to Piadena and Parma.

After Second World War the population grew. It reached 2,000 in the 1960s and 3,000 in the 1980s.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the main source of the economy and within the commune. There are iron and steel plants.

Manufacturing company expanded and opened plants like SETA in the 1950s and Duferdofin in the 1970s.

==Sites of interest==
*Cascina Pietà
*Cascina Naviglio
*Cascina Pontevica

== Transportation ==
San Zeno is served by a railway station, named &quot;San Zeno-Folzano&quot; because it also serves the village of Folzano in the municipality of Brescia. The station is a junction of the railway lines Brescia–Cremona and Brescia–Parma.

<doc id="1139951" wikidata="Q944255" url="?curid=1139951" title="Mattias Öhlund">
<text>Kenneth Mattias Öhlund (born 9 September 1976) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning. Öhlund played two seasons in the Swedish Allsvenskan, the second highest tier of hockey in Sweden, with Piteå HC before being selected by the Canucks 13th overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He then joined Luleå HF of the Elitserien, the highest league in Sweden, winning the Le Mat Trophy as league champions in 1996. He began his NHL career with Vancouver in 1997–98, the start of an 11-year tenure with the club in which he became the Canucks&#x27; all-time leader in points for a defenceman (since surpassed by Alexander Edler). Öhlund would play the final two seasons of his professional career with the Tampa Bay Lightning before retiring in 2011. A serious eye injury before his third NHL season was the first of many injuries Öhlund has sustained over his career, and he only played a full season twice in his 13-year NHL career.

Internationally, Öhlund represented Sweden in numerous tournaments, beginning with three World Junior Championships that included Best Defenceman honours as part of a silver medal effort in 1996. He has since competed in three World Championships, earning gold in 1998, and three Winter Olympics, earning gold in 2006.

==Playing career==
===Sweden===
Öhlund began his playing career with Piteå HC in his hometown, playing two seasons with the team. As a large, mobile defenceman, he was heavily scouted by scouts from several NHL teams during his final season with Piteå. He was the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; first pick, 13th overall, in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Rather than join the Canucks, Öhlund stayed in Sweden as a result of a dispute over his contract with the team. He joined a new team, Luleå HF of the top-flight Elitserien. In his first Elitserien season, he scored 16 points in 34 games. The following season, he scored 14 points in 38 games as Luleå HF won the Le Mat Trophy as champions of the Elitserien, their first league championship. Appearing in 47 games with Luleå during the 1996–97 season, Öhlund recorded seven goals and nine assists.

===Vancouver Canucks===

Four years after being drafted by the Canucks, Öhlund was set to be eligible to re-enter the NHL Entry Draft when he signed a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs on August 1, 1997. Worth US$10 million over five years, including a signing bonus of $7.5 million, it was considerably more than the maximum rookie contract of $850,000 per year the Canucks, as the team that drafted Öhlund, were allowed to offer. Under league rules, the Canucks were given one week to either match the contract or trade Öhlund&#x27;s NHL rights to the Maple Leafs. Rather than lose him, the Canucks agreed to the contract on August 7.

As part of a promotion for the 1998 Winter Olympics, the first to allow NHL participation in the ice hockey tournament, the Canucks opened the 1997–98 season with a pair of games against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo. Öhlund thus played his first NHL game in Japan on October 3, 1997. He scored his first goal against Félix Potvin of the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 9, as well as earning his first assist in that game. Playing 77 games as a rookie, he tied Jyrki Lumme for the team lead in scoring among defencemen with 7 goals and 30 points. In recognition of his play during the season, he was awarded the Babe Pratt Trophy, given to the Canucks&#x27; best defenceman. In addition, Öhlund was nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the best rookie in the league, finishing second in voting to Sergei Samsonov of the Boston Bruins with 11 first-place ballots to Samsonov&#x27;s 43. His 30 points, the fifth best total among first year players and highest by a rookie defenceman, helped him earn a position on the NHL All-Rookie Team.

In his second season in the NHL, Öhlund was selected to the annual NHL All-Star Game as a replacement for an injured player. Playing for the World team, composed of NHLers from outside North America, Öhlund scored one goal and had an assist as the North American team won, 8–6. With 9 goals and 35 points in 74 games, Öhlund led the Canucks&#x27; defencemen in scoring and placed fifth overall on the team.

Prior to the start of the 1999–2000 season, in a pre-season game against the Ottawa Senators on September 21, 1999, a puck deflected off Öhlund&#x27;s stick and struck him in the right eye. The injury forced Öhlund to miss the first 38 games of the season. He underwent surgery to correct his vision and returned to the Canucks the same season and scored 20 points in 42 games, again winning the Babe Pratt Trophy as the Canucks&#x27; best defenceman. The following year, he missed an additional 17 games after undergoing surgery once more to relieve building internal pressure on his eye. Playing in his first game back in the lineup on November 28, 2000, Öhlund scored the game-winning goal for the Canucks in a 4–1 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Öhlund played the final 65 games of the season, scoring 8 goals and 28 points. He also made his Stanley Cup playoffs debut, recording four points in four games.

The 2001–02 season saw Öhlund play 81 games and record a career-high 36 points, with an additional two points in six playoff games. A knee injury during the 2002–03 season led Öhlund to miss several games; while he only scored 2 goals in the 59 games he played in, Öhlund set a career-high in assists with 27. That was followed by appearing in a career-high 13 playoff games, where he had three goals and four assists for seven points. In 2003–04, Öhlund tallied a career-high 14 goals and played in all 82 games with Vancouver for the first time in his career. For his efforts, Öhlund was named the winner of the Babe Pratt Trophy.

The 2004–05 season was cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Like many other NHL players, Öhlund played in Europe, joining his former team, Luleå HF, on December 21. However, eight days later, after playing two games with the team and scoring one goal, Öhlund left the team. As well as briefly playing in Sweden, Öhlund took part in a charity hockey match set up by Canucks teammate Brad May and held in Vancouver on December 12, 2004. Including several NHL players, the game raised nearly $1 million for charity. The NHL resumed play for the 2005–06 season; Öhlund recorded 33 points in 78 games, including leading Canucks defencemen with 13 goals, winning the Babe Pratt Trophy for the fourth time in his career.
Early in the 2007–08 season, Öhlund received a four-game suspension, the first of his career, for an incident near the end of a November 16, 2007, game against the Minnesota Wild. In the third period, Wild forward Mikko Koivu hit Öhlund, and Öhlund retaliated by slashing Koivu in the leg with his stick, breaking Koivu&#x27;s fibula. After returning from the suspension, Öhlund became the Canucks&#x27; all-time leader in goals among defencemen, scoring the game-tying goal against the Edmonton Oilers on December 15, 2007, to pass former teammate Jyrki Lumme with 84 goals. After bone chips were detected in his knee in early March 2008, Öhlund underwent knee surgery on March 13 and missed the remainder of the season. The leading scorer amongst Canucks defencemen at the time of the surgery, Öhlund finished second amongst the defencemen with 24 points in 53 games.

With the departure of Markus Näslund in the 2008 off-season, Öhlund became the longest serving player on the Canucks&#x27; roster. Before the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Öhlund was named (along with Ryan Kesler and Willie Mitchell) as alternate captains to goaltender Roberto Luongo, who replaced Näslund as captain. Due to the limitations of having a goalie as captain, Öhlund was designated the captain&#x27;s traditional duty of taking ceremonial faceoffs. Beginning the season 22 points behind Jyrki Lumme and Dennis Kearns for the franchise&#x27;s all-time point-scoring record for a defenceman, Öhlund surpassed the mark on March 15, 2009, with an assist in a 4–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche for his 322nd point as a Canuck. He played all 82 games for the second time in his career, and finished tied for third on the team for points by a defenceman with 25.

Over 11 seasons with the Canucks, Öhlund registered team records of 93 goals and 325 points as a defenceman (both since passed by Alexander Edler). His 232 assists ranked fourth among all-time Canucks defencemen, while his 770 games played was second among defencemen and fifth overall. In his latter years with the Canucks, Öhlund served as a mentor while being paired with fellow defenceman and Swedish native Alexander Edler, who was beginning his NHL career.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Öhlund signed a seven-year, $26.25 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on July 1, 2009. Brought in as a mentor to fellow Swedish defenceman Victor Hedman, whom the Lightning drafted second overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Öhlund was named an alternate captain of the Lightning. His first game with the Lightning was on October 3, 2009, against the Atlanta Thrashers; Öhlund had one assist in the game. The following month, he suffered an ankle injury after catching his skate into ice during a game against the Los Angeles Kings on November 14, 2009. He returned after missing seven games. He re-injured the ankle in March 2011 after colliding with Christian Hanson during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, causing him to miss an additional eight games. Öhlund finished his first season with the Lightning with no goals and 13 assists in 67 games. Offensively, it marked the lowest point total of his career and the first time he did not score a goal during the regular season during his NHL career up to that point. Despite his reduced offensive statistics, he remained a key defenceman on the Lightning roster, leading the team with 22 minutes and 47 seconds of average ice time per game and 116 blocked shots.

In the off-season, Öhlund underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Though he aggravated the knee at the beginning of the Lightning&#x27;s training camp in September 2010, he continued to play in pre-season games. However, due to inflammation and fluid build-up in the knee, he was sidelined for the first eight games of the 2010–11 season. Later in the season, he began suffering from a deep bone bruise on his left knee that he continued to play in spite of. In late-February and early-March 2011, he was subsequently sidelined two games with a lower-body injury. Öhlund failed to score a goal for the second consecutive regular season in 2010–11, recording 5 assists in 72 games, a career-low. His ice time reduced significantly as he ranked sixth among team defencemen with an average of 18 minutes and 43 seconds per game. After finishing 12th overall in the Eastern Conference the previous season, the Lightning qualified for the 2011 playoffs as the fifth seed. In Game 2 of the opening round against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Öhlund registered his first goal with the Lightning, scoring into an empty net in a 5–1 win. He added two assists over the course of a career-high 18 playoff games as Tampa Bay was eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals. In an interview the following year, Öhlund recalled the 2010–11 season as &quot;the most fun [he] had playing hockey, ever&quot;.

Prior to the start of the 2011–12 season, Öhlund began experiencing inflammation in his right knee. The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees. After there was optimism he was close to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012. During his recovery, he told reporters with Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; that he was unsure whether he could continue playing.

His contract with the Lightning expired July 1, 2016. He was until that date listed on the team roster but was on injured reserve since 2011, with hockey experts citing him alongside Chris Pronger and Marc Savard as players who have not officially retired while letting their contracts continue, but who will not play in the NHL again.

&quot;For a long period of time I&#x27;ve been trying to get better and better, but clearly the longer you don&#x27;t play, the likelihood of playing again gets smaller and smaller each day, especially at my age,&quot; Öhlund told the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; in April 2013. &quot;I don&#x27;t know long term what my situation will be, but I&#x27;m sure it will be figured out shortly.&quot;

Öhlund was inducted into the Canucks&#x27; Ring of Honour on December 16, 2016.

==International play==
Early in his career, Öhlund was selected to play in three World Junior Championships for Sweden. Beginning in 1994, he contributed two assists in seven games as part of a silver medal effort. As the medals were determined by a round-robin format, Sweden fell one point short of Canada, losing 6–4 to them in their final and deciding game. After a bronze medal in 1995, Öhlund returned for a third straight World Junior tournament in 1996 to record five assists and was named the tournament&#x27;s Best Defenceman. He was additionally named to the Tournament All-Star Team as he captured his second World Junior silver medal.

Öhlund made his debut for the Swedish senior national team in 1997 at the World Championships, his first of three appearances in the tournament. He scored 2 goals and added 1 assist in 11 games as Sweden captured a silver medal. He returned the following year in 1998 to match his previous statistical output while earning his first gold medal with Sweden. In his third World Championship appearance, the 2001 World Championships, Öhlund tallied five points to help Sweden to a bronze medal.

The 1998 Winter Olympics was the first of three consecutive Olympic games Öhlund appeared in. He played in all four games for Sweden and registered one assist as Sweden finished in a tie for fifth place, out of medal contention. Four years later, Öhlund was selected for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. However, in pre-Olympic drug testing by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Öhlund tested positive for the banned substance acetazolamide. The substance was inadvertently ingested after Öhlund took Diamox, a drug he had used previously while undergoing eye surgery. As the ingestion was unintentional, he was cleared to play. After a dominant round-robin, Sweden was eliminated by Belarus in the quarter-final game, considered one of the biggest upsets in international hockey history and the darkest moment in Swedish hockey history. Öhlund finished the tournament with two points in four games.

In the following Olympics, Öhlund helped Sweden to the 2006 gold medal in Turin. After earning two assists in six games, Öhlund was forced out of the tournament after getting hit into the boards and fracturing his ribs during a game against Switzerland. Unable to play in the final against Finland, he nevertheless received a gold medal from the IOC. Canucks teammates Daniel and Henrik Sedin, who also played on the championship team, offered to give Öhlund one of their gold medals if the IOC would not give him one, while his replacement on the team, Niklas Kronwall, made the same offer.

Additionally, Öhlund competed in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, which preceded the 2004–05 NHL lockout. In four games, he recorded one goal and one assist.

==Personal life==
Growing up in Piteå, Öhlund idolised fellow Swedish defenceman Börje Salming, who played 17 seasons in the NHL. He is married to wife Linda and has a daughter, Hannah, and a son, Viktor. They reside in Tampa during the hockey season, and return to Piteå during the summer.

<text>A time deposit or term deposit (also known as a [[certificate of deposit]] in the United States, and as a [[guaranteed investment certificate]] in Canada) is a deposit in a financial institution with a specific maturity date or a period to maturity, commonly referred to as its &quot;term&quot;. Time deposits differ from &quot;at call deposits&quot;, such as savings or checking accounts, which can be withdrawn at any time, without any notice or penalty. Deposits that require notice of withdrawal to be given are effectively time deposits, though they do not have a fixed maturity date.

Unlike a certificate of deposit and bonds, a time deposit is generally not negotiable; it is not transferable by the depositor, so that depositors need to deal with the financial institution when they need to prematurely cash out of the deposit.

Time deposits enable the bank to invest the funds in higher-earning financial products. In some countries, including the United States, time deposits are not subject to the banks’ reserve requirements, on the basis that the funds cannot be withdrawn at short notice. In some countries, time deposits are guaranteed by the government or protected by deposit insurance.

==Interest==
Time deposits normally earn interest, which is normally fixed for the duration of the term and payable upon maturity, though some may be paid periodically during the term, especially with longer-term deposits. Generally, the longer the term and the larger the deposit amount the higher the interest rate that will be offered.

The interest paid on a time deposit tends to be higher than on an at-call savings account, but tends to be lower than that of riskier products such as stocks or bonds. Some banks offer market-linked time deposit accounts which offer potentially higher returns while guaranteeing principal.

==At maturity==
At maturity, the principal can be either paid back to the depositor (usually by a deposit into a bank account designated by the depositor) or rolled over for another term. Interest may be paid into the same account as the principal or to another bank account or rolled over with the principal to the next term.

The money deposited normally can be withdrawn before maturity, but a significant penalty will normally be payable.

<text>O is a 2001 American romantic thriller film, and a modern adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, set in an American high school. It stars Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles, and Josh Hartnett. It was directed by Tim Blake Nelson and written by Brad Kaaya. The film contains many different styles of music, ranging from rap to opera. It was filmed in Charleston, South Carolina in the spring of 1999. Originally intended for release for October 17, 1999, it was shelved following the Columbine High School massacre; &quot;O&quot; was finally released on August 31, 2001. The film grossed $16 million at the United States box office, which was seen by distributor Lions Gate Films as a &quot;box office success&quot;.

==Plot==
During a high school basketball game, Odin James scores the basket that wins the game for his team. Later at an awards ceremony, coach Duke Goulding presents the Most Valuable Player award to Odin for his efforts, an award he shares with his teammate Michael Cassio. In giving Odin the award, Duke passes over his son Hugo, Odin&#x27;s teammate and friend. At a party celebrating the victory, Hugo plots with school outcast Roger Calhoun to go to the school&#x27;s dean, Bob Brable, and tell him that Odin had raped the dean&#x27;s daughter, Desi, whom Odin has been dating. Hugo promises Roger that Desi will be his after Odin is out of the way, but Roger is only a pawn in Hugo&#x27;s ultimate plan to destroy Odin.

Later, in another game, Odin&#x27;s team wins once again. At the celebration party, Hugo engineers a fight between Roger and a very drunk Michael, who is temporarily suspended from the team. Hugo tells Michael to ingratiate himself with Desi so that she will talk to Odin on his behalf. Soon afterward, Hugo tells Odin that Michael and Desi have been spending a lot of time together, and that she may be cheating on him. Odin doesn&#x27;t believe this at first, but gradually comes to suspect them. Odin questions Desi, but she calms him down and he believes her. Nevertheless, the stress of the situation drives Odin to begin using drugs.

Hugo manipulates his girlfriend Emily into stealing a scarf for him that Odin gave to Desi. Hugo, in turn, gives it to Michael in hopes that Odin will believe Desi gave Michael the scarf—furthering the notion that Desi is cheating on Odin.

Meanwhile, Odin and Desi are having sex at a motel, during which Odin sees an image of Michael on top of Desi in the mirror; angered, he becomes very rough with Desi, to the point that she cries out for him to stop, a plea he ignores as he continues to rape her. Afterward, they lie together staring in opposite directions.

After Odin assaults another student during a game in a drug-fueled rage, Hugo tells him about the scarf, convincing him that Desi is cheating on him. Enraged, Odin vows to kill her, and Hugo then promises he will kill Michael.

Hugo, Odin, and Roger make plans to kill both Michael and Desi. Hugo and Roger attempt to kill Michael in a carjacking, but it does not go as planned: Roger and Michael struggle, Hugo hits Michael with a crowbar, knocking him unconscious. Roger shoots Michael in the leg, and then Hugo turns the gun on Roger and kills him after telling him that Desi is dead.

Odin and Desi are in Desi&#x27;s room talking and Odin is pretending to make up with her. They are making out on the bed when suddenly Odin attacks her; Desi fights back, but he finally strangles her to death. Emily rushes into the room and sees Desi&#x27;s body; she soon finds out what Hugo has done. She begins telling Odin that Hugo told her to steal the scarf and exposes his plot, but Hugo fatally shoots her when she refuses to be quiet. Odin finally realizes that Hugo has been manipulating him the entire time, and demands to know why; Hugo refuses to answer. When the police arrive, Odin tells them what happened and shoots himself, dying by suicide. As Hugo is taken into police custody, he says in voice-over that he will have his day in the spotlight.

==Cast==
* Mekhi Phifer as Odin James (based on Othello)
* Josh Hartnett as Hugo Goulding (based on Iago)
* Julia Stiles as Desi Brable (based on Desdemona)
* Elden Henson as Roger Calhoun (based on Roderigo)
* Andrew Keegan as Michael Cassio (based on Michael Cassio)

* Martin Sheen as Coach Duke Goulding (based on the Duke of Venice)
* John Heard as Bob Brable (based on Brabantio)
* Anthony Johnson as Dell
* Rachel Shumate as Brandy (based on Bianca)

== Production ==
Screenwriter Brad Kaaya&#x27;s inspiration for the script came from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;the spate of suburban school shootings that rocked the country in the 1980s&quot;, and his own experiences as a black teenager attending a largely white private school. Tim Blake Nelson came across the script while filming Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, and was offered the chance to direct based on his directorial debut &quot;Eye of God&quot;.

Filming began in Charleston, South Carolina in early 1999 and wrapped that March. Dimension Films, a division of Miramax, acquired the film two days into principal photography. Nelson received the offer to appear in &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; while he was making this film.

==Release==
The official release date was initially October 17, 1999, but was postponed following the Columbine High School massacre in April of that year. The delay was likely due to the film&#x27;s themes of sex and violence in high school, as suggested by its director. Another theory is that it was held back until after the 2000 U.S. presidential election. The film was initially due to be released by Miramax but the studio passed it to Lions Gate after &quot;O&quot;&#x27;s producers sued for breach of contract.

The film was finally released theatrically on August 31, 2001.

==Reception==
The film has received moderately positive reviews. 
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 65% approval rating based on 124 reviews, with an average score of 6.1/10 and a consensus: &quot;Though well-intentioned and serious in its exploration of teen violence, &quot;O&quot; is an uneven experiment that doesn&#x27;t quite succeed&quot;. On Metacritic, the film achieved an average score of 53 out of 100 based on 26 reviews, signifying &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 and ½ stars out of 4 and wrote &quot;O&quot; is &quot;a good film for most of the way, and then a powerful film at the end, when, in the traditional Shakespearean manner, all of the plot threads come together.&quot; Ebert added, &quot;Mekhi Phifer makes a strong, tortured Odin, and delivers a final speech, which in its heartbreaking anguish, inspires our pity much as Othello&#x27;s does. Josh Hartnett showed here, years before &#x27;&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;,&#x27; that he is capable of subtleties and complexities that epic did not dream of.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; also gave a positive review, writing, &quot;The result is that a tale of teen violence takes on qualities of timelessness and universality it would not otherwise possess, while the &quot;&#x27;Othello&quot;&#x27; story leaps out with a rare immediacy.&quot;

Other reviews pointed out how the modern setting of a Shakespeare adaptation emphasizes the improbability of plot events. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;In modernizing this shattering tale of love, jealousy, deceit and betrayal, screenwriter Brad Kaaya has been faithful to the play&#x27;s emotions and plot mechanics, but these elements become burdens in a context that can&#x27;t support them, with the result the drama’s extreme and tragic actions seem fatally under motivated.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; positively cited the &quot;hearty performances from Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles and Josh Hartnett&quot;, but wrote &quot;Hugo&#x27;s scheming comes across as convoluted and transparent.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;O&quot; was nominated for a Black Reel Award for Best Actor for Mekhi Phifer. Tim Blake Nelson also won the Golden Space Needle Award at the Seattle international Film Festival for Best Director.

<text>Nightfall and Other Stories (1969) is a collection of 20 previously published science fiction short stories by Isaac Asimov. Asimov added a brief introduction to each story, explaining some aspect of the story&#x27;s history and/or how it came to be written.

==Background==
In the introduction for the title story, &quot;Nightfall,&quot; Asimov explained that although pleased by the praise it had received, he disliked &quot;being told, over and over again&quot; that a story he had written at the age of 21 was his best. Asimov hoped that the collection would prove that &quot;sheer practice [had] made me more proficient, technically, with each year&quot;. He chose successful stories not included before in any anthologies edited by Asimov himself.

<text>St Germans Priory is a large Norman church in the village of St Germans in south-east Cornwall, England, UK.

==History==
According to tradition the church here was founded by St Germanus himself . The first written record however is of Conan being made Bishop in the Church of St Germans as a result of King Athelstan&#x27;s settlement with Cornwall. The fixing of the see here shows that the Celtic monastery was already of great importance. Possession of two holdings of land in the parishes of Landrake (&quot;Landerhtun&quot;) and Landulph (&quot;Tinieltun&quot; i.e. Tinnel) was confirmed by King Canute in 1018; they had been granted by King Edmund. Both holdings remained in the monastery&#x27;s possession until 1538. In 1042 the see was moved to Crediton and the lands of the monastery were divided into two parts, one for the monastery and one (named Cuddenbeak) for the Bishop of Crediton. After the Norman Conquest a college of secular canons was established which is said to have been reconstituted in the time of Bishop Bartholomew (1161–1184) as a college of regular canons.

The present church replaces an Anglo-Saxon building which was the cathedral of the Bishops of Cornwall. The church is dedicated to St Germanus and soon after construction it became the cathedral for Cornwall in 926 AD, when King Athelstan appointed Conan as the bishop of Cornwall. The bishopric was to be short-lived, however, as it was transferred to Crediton in 1042 AD. A monastery grew alongside the church, and was reorganized by the Bishop of Exeter between 1161 and 1184 as an Augustinian priory. The priory church was rebuilt on a grand scale, with two western towers and a nave of 102 ft.
The church was once called the Cathedral of Cornwall because it is where the bishop of the duchy would be.

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII the priory was abolished and its buildings became a private house, home to the Eliot family, in whose hands the house remains. A number of the Eliot family are interred in the church.

St Germans parish was once the largest in Cornwall. St Germans Priory is now managed by the Church of England and the St Germans Priory Trust.

==Architecture==
Some of the original Norman features remain, including the large arched western doorway which is particularly ornate and is carved from elvan quarried at Landrake.

There is a mortuary chapel for the Moyle family of Bake.

At Dupath Well the wellhouse is said to have been built in 1510 by the monks of St Germans.

There is a peal of eight bells.

A magnificent though incongruous Baroque monument in black and white marble is situated in space below north tower. It is dedicated to Edward Elliot (1682-1722), Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of St Germans between 1705 and 1710. It is an early work in England by noted Flemish sculptor John Michael Rysbrack, commissioned in 1723.

Large five-light Perpendicular east window was glazed in 1896 by Morris and Co., to designs of Edward Burne-Jones. The donor was Alfred Burton. It two tiers of five figures show Christ to upper centre flanked by a centurion and St Mary, Sister of Lazarus to left and St Mary Virgin and St Paul to right. Below is St Stephen to centre, flanked by the Four Evangelists, saints Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In tracery lights above is a choir of angels. 

South wall has two additional three-light windows filled with glass designed by Burne-Jones and manufactured by Morris &amp; Co. Installed in 1902, they show allegorical representations of the Virtues and are designs from earlier in Burne-Jones&#x27; career.

The church has a two manual pipe organ on the left side of the church. The church also has two towers.

<doc id="1139973" wikidata="Q17055541" url="?curid=1139973" title="Spirit of Place (album)">
<text>Spirit of Place is the debut studio album by Australian folk rock band Goanna. It was originally released in November 1982, it peaked at No. 2 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by May 1983.

&quot;Spirit of Place&quot; was the first charting rock record to feature the didgeridoo. The didgeridoo is particularly prominent on &quot;Solid Rock&quot;, which was a No. 3 hit on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart in October. The album was also heavy on social protest themes; &quot;Solid Rock&quot; deals with issues of land rights for Indigenous Australians. &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; tackled rural despair and achieved a Top 40 spot in April 1983. The album was re-released in a remastered and expanded form in 2003.

==Background==
The Goanna Band was formed as an Australian folk rock group in 1977. The original line-up was Mike Biscan (guitar), Richard Griffiths (bass guitar), Shane Howard (lead vocals, guitar) and Rod Hoe (drums). In 1979, the group was Howard with keyboardist and vocalist Rose Bygrave, drummer Gary Crothall, lead guitarist and vocalist Warwick Harwood, vocalist and harmonica player Ian Morrison and bass guitarist Carl Smith. They recorded the independent 12-inch EP, &quot;The Goanna Band&quot;, which was produced by ex-Dingoes lead vocalist Broderick Smith. By mid-1981, they had updated the line-up with Peter &#x27;Brolga&#x27; Coughlan on bass and Robbie Ross on drums. They then shortened the name to Goanna and with their increasing popularity they attracted the interest of major record companies.

In August 1981, they supported James Taylor on the Australian leg of his tour, where they met Billy Payne, who would later become the producer of their second album, &quot;Oceania&quot;. In February 1982, they signed to WEA Australia. The band released its single &quot;Solid Rock&quot; in September. According to Howard, the inspiration came on a ten-day camping trip at Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock) during 1980 where he had a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; which brought &quot;the fire in the belly&quot; to the surface over injustices to Australia’s indigenous peoples. WEA was reluctant to issue it as a single and even Shane initially had reservations about whether commercial radio would play it because of its politically sensitive theme but then Howard insisted on its release to make a statement about the European invasion of Australia. &quot;Solid Rock&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, remaining in the Top 50 for 26 weeks. It reached No. 31 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart and appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Goanna released their debut album, &quot;Spirit of Place&quot;, in November. It was produced by Trevor Lucas, a member of UK folk rock group Fairport Convention, who had returned to Australia in 1979. &quot;Spirit of Place&quot; reached No. 2 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. It also reached No. 179 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. For the album, Goanna were Bygrave, Peter Coughlan on bass guitar, Graham Davidge (ex-Little River Band) on guitar, Harwood, Howard, his sister Marcia Howard on backing vocals, Mick &quot;The Reverend&quot; O’Connor on keyboards and Robert Ross on drums. An ever-changing lineup saw Harwood leave the band soon after its release.

On 13 February 1983, Gordon Franklin &amp; the Wilderness Ensemble performed &quot;Let the Franklin Flow&quot; at the People for Nuclear Disarmament Concert in Sidney Myer Music Bowl. The ensemble included members of Goanna and fellow folk rock group Redgum, and Lucas. In May, &quot;Let the Franklin Flow&quot; was issued as a single with Lucas and Jeff Chapell as producers. Howard, the song&#x27;s writer, was credited as F. River. The single reached No. 12 nationally. Proceeds supported the Tasmanian Wilderness Society&#x27;s campaign against the proposed damming of Tasmania&#x27;s Gordon and Franklin Rivers for a hydroelectricity project. Howard physically supported the protests by joining the picket lines. The B-side of the single, &quot;Franklin River – World Heritage&quot;, was written and recorded by the Society&#x27;s director, Bob Brown, who later became a senator and the leader of Australian Greens.

On 19 April 1983, Goanna won three &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards for their work in 1982: &quot;Spirit of Place&quot; won &#x27;Best Debut Album&#x27;, &quot;Solid Rock&quot; won &#x27;Best Debut Single&#x27; and the band itself won &#x27;Best New Talent (Johnny O&#x27;Keefe Memorial Award)&#x27;. &quot;Solid Rock&quot; is the first charting rock record to feature extensive use of the didgeridoo, one of the world&#x27;s oldest wood instruments, played by Billy Inda (No Fixed Address). The follow-up single, &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (a reworking of a song from their 1979 EP), was released in March 1983. The more acoustically based folk-rock track reached No. 36.

In 2003, &quot;Spirit of Place&quot; was digitally re-mastered by Shane with the addition of 7 previously unreleased tracks including three live versions. The album continues to chart in the Australian Top 200 with &quot;Solid Rock&quot; appearing on several Australian rock compilation releases and the video being shown from time to time on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Rage&quot; music video program even though the song celebrated its 30th anniversary in October 2012.

<text>Jakalope was a Canadian Indie pop/rock group. They formed in 2003 and named for the mythical creature of the jackalope. The band was started by noted Canadian industrial musician and producer Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie, most famous for his studio work with such acts as Skinny Puppy, David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, and Marilyn Manson. The band gained much popularity after playing the opening theme song to seasons 4–7 of the TV series &quot;&quot;.

==History==

===Beginnings and &quot;It Dreams&quot;===
Jakalope began in 2003 as an open-concept project headed by Dave Ogilvie. His conceptual aim was towards a new musical genre rooted in industrial rock (for which Ogilvie is famed), but would be able to flow smoothly between searing rock and melodic pop. It was around this time that Ogilvie became acquainted with the vocal stylings of Katie B while she was working at Bryan Adams&#x27; The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver. The two of them had instant chemistry, and Katie took her position center stage as the front woman of Jakalope.

Their debut album, &quot;It Dreams&quot;, was released in 2004, and spawned the hit singles and videos &quot;Pretty Life&quot;, and &quot;Feel It&quot;. The third single was &quot;Go Away&quot;, but the video received little play on MuchMusic and was unsuccessful compared to the two previous singles. In 2005 &quot;It Dreams&quot; was released in Japan.

For this album, the band collaborated with a large number of guest musicians, including Trent Reznor (who contributed production work, as well as song writing, and instrumentation), Kat Bjelland and members of Acid Polly Sloan, Monster Magnet and Malhavoc.

The cover art for &quot;It Dreams&quot; received the Juno Award for Best CD/DVD Artwork Design of the Year in 2005, and was designed by artist Vincent Marcone.

===Born 4===
In early October 2005, the Orange Record Label confirmed that Jakalope would return to the studio in late October to record their next album, &quot;Born 4&quot;. The first single off the album, &quot;Upside Down (And I Fall)&quot;, was released to radio in March 2006. There was some controversy with the release date constantly changing, from an initial date set for spring 2006. Due to undisclosed reasons the release date was postponed several times, until the release on October 3.

Trent Reznor returned as co-producer and other guests on the second album include Allie Sheldan (Rio Bent), Thom D&#x27;arcy (Small Sins), Bob Pantella (Monster Magnet), Alex Lifeson (Rush), Jeremy Fisher and Bill Rieflin (Ministry, R.E.M., Married To Music). Vincent Marcone returned once more to do the CD design.

&quot;Born 4&quot; was released on June 7, 2006 in Japan, and on October 3 in Canada. It was later made available for purchase on iTunes in both the United States and Canada.

===Katie B&#x27;s departure and the arrival of Chrystal Leigh===
In spring 2007, frontwoman Katie B. left the band to pursue a solo career. She summarizes her experience with Jakalope as a time where she &quot;grew as a songwriter, a performer, an artist, and learned many a valuable lesson&quot;. The split was said to be amicable and there is no ill will between the two parties.

The spot of lead singer was eventually filled by Chrystal Leigh, former lead singer for now-defunct Vancouver band The Perfect Strangers. She also fronted the Chrystal Leigh Band during a stint in Kelowna, and contributed supporting vocals to the song &quot;Vertebrae&quot; by Closing Iris. Of Chrystal, Ogilvie has said: &quot;I was blown away by her personality, her voice, and the fact that she&#x27;s a piano player. I was dying to have someone to collaborate with, who actually is a musician and not just a singer.&quot;

For the next few years, Jakalope slowly put together new material and searched for a new label. They still played the occasional show, such as playing at the 2009 Juno Festival and released the occasional song via their Myspace.

===&quot;Things That Go Jump in the Night&quot;===
First, the band released two new songs, via their official Myspace, the first titled &quot;Delicious&quot; and the second, a cover of the Julee Cruise song, &quot;Falling&quot;. Ogilvie announced that the album would be named &quot;Delicious&quot;. Another song, titled &quot;Last Song&quot;, was released via the official Jakalope fansite. A remix of &quot;Delicious&quot; by Alkatraz was also released to their Myspace.

In August 2009, Jakalope released yet another new song, titled &quot;a.k.a. Cupcake&quot;, through their YouTube account and announced that final recording for their second album had begun.

In February 2010, the band announced that they had signed to 604 Records and soon after announced that filming of a video for a single titled &quot;Witness&quot; would be taking place the following week.

In March 2010, the band announced via Twitter that the first single would be released at the end of March and the new album would be out by the end of May.

On May 19, 2010, Jakalope posted three new songs on their MySpace page, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Baby Blue&quot; and &quot;Combine&quot;, as well as a trailer for the music video for &quot;Witness&quot;.

On July 13, 2010, &quot;Witness&quot;, the first single from the band&#x27;s third album, was made available through the iTunes Store. The Kevvy Mental remix of &quot;Witness&quot; by Kevin James Maher was also made available for purchase.

A music video was later made for the song &quot;Magnolia&quot;.

==Members==
Due to the nature of the band, there are constantly rotating members, however the core members of the band are:
* Chrystal Leigh – lead vocals, keyboard and piano
* Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie – keyboard, guitar and vocals

===Past members===
* Katie B
* Phil Western

==Discography==

===Albums===
* &quot;It Dreams&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Born 4&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Things That Go Jump in the Night&quot; (October 26, 2010)

===Singles===
* &quot;Pretty Life&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Feel It&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Go Away&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Upside Down (And I Fall)&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Digging Deep&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Witness&quot; (2010)

==Trivia==
*They performed the theme for the opening credits of &quot;&quot; in seasons 4 and 5. In seasons 6 and 7 the vocals were stripped and the instrumental (still performed by Jakalope) was used. That song, along with &quot;Feel It&quot;, was featured on the 2005 soundtrack &quot;Songs from Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;, and again in 2008 on &quot;Music from Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;.
*Their song &quot;Upside Down (And I Fall)&quot; was used as part of the soundtrack to the mountain biking video &quot;New World Disorder 8 – Smackdown&quot;, part of the &quot;New World Disorder (Freeride Mountain Biking Movie Series)&quot;.
*Jakalope&#x27;s song &quot;Remote Control&quot; was used in the &quot;Instant Star&quot; episode &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; as Eden&#x27;s Instant Star song, and their song &quot;Go Away&quot; was featured in the episode &quot;The Jean Jenie&quot;.
*Jakalope&#x27;s Chrystal Leigh contributed vocals to the album that was produced and partially co-written by bandmate Dave Ogilvie for Toronto-based act Raggedy Angry.
*The song &quot;Pretty Life&quot; was featured in the &quot;Lost Girl&quot; episode &quot;Dead Lucky&quot; while Bo and Kenzi enter an underground gambling den.

<doc id="1139981" wikidata="Q1003216" url="?curid=1139981" title="Hyperbolic angle">
<text>In geometry, hyperbolic angle is a real number determined by the area of the corresponding hyperbolic sector of &quot;xy&quot; = 1 in Quadrant I of the Cartesian plane. The hyperbolic angle parametrizes the unit hyperbola, which has hyperbolic functions as coordinates. In mathematics, hyperbolic angle is an invariant measure as it is preserved under hyperbolic rotation.

The hyperbola &quot;xy&quot; = 1 is rectangular with semi-major axis formula_1, analogous to the circular angle equaling the area of a circular sector in a circle with radius formula_1.

Hyperbolic angle is used as the independent variable for the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh, because these functions may be premised on hyperbolic analogies to the corresponding circular (trigonometric) functions by regarding a hyperbolic angle as defining a hyperbolic triangle.
The parameter thus becomes one of the most useful in the calculus of real variables.

==Definition==
Consider the rectangular hyperbola formula_3, and (by convention) pay particular attention to the &quot;branch&quot; formula_4.

First define:
* The hyperbolic angle in &quot;standard position&quot; is the angle at formula_5 between the ray to formula_6 and the ray to formula_7, where formula_4.
* The magnitude of this angle is the area of the corresponding hyperbolic sector, which turns out to be formula_9.

Note that, because of the role played by the natural logarithm:
* Unlike circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is &quot;unbounded&quot; (because formula_9 is unbounded); this is related to the fact that the harmonic series is unbounded.
* The formula for the magnitude of the angle suggests that, for formula_11, the hyperbolic angle should be negative. This reflects the fact that, as defined, the angle is &quot;directed&quot;.

Finally, extend the definition of &quot;hyperbolic angle&quot; to that subtended by any interval on the hyperbola. Suppose formula_12 are positive real numbers such that formula_13 and formula_14, so that formula_15 and formula_16 are points on the hyperbola formula_17 and determine an interval on it. Then the squeeze mapping formula_18 maps the angle formula_19 to the &quot;standard position&quot; angle formula_20. By the result of Gregoire de Saint-Vincent, the hyperbolic sectors determined by these angles have the same area, which is taken to be the magnitude of the angle. This magnitude is formula_21.

==Comparison with circular angle==


A unit circle formula_22 has a circular sector with an area half of the circular angle in radians. Analogously, a unit hyperbola formula_23 has a hyperbolic sector with an area half of the hyperbolic angle.

There is also a projective resolution between circular and hyperbolic cases: both curves are conic sections, and hence are treated as projective ranges in projective geometry. Given an origin point on one of these ranges, other points correspond to angles. The idea of addition of angles, basic to science, corresponds to addition of points on one of these ranges as follows:

Circular angles can be characterized geometrically by the property that if two chords &quot;P&#x27;P&quot; and &quot;P&#x27;P&quot; subtend angles &quot;L&quot; and &quot;L&quot; at the centre of a circle, their sum is the angle subtended by a chord &quot;P&#x27;Q&quot;, where &quot;P&#x27;Q&quot; is required to be parallel to &quot;P&quot;&quot;P&quot;.

The same construction can also be applied to the hyperbola. If &quot;P&quot; is taken to be the point , &quot;P&quot; the point , and &quot;P&quot; the point , then the parallel condition requires that &quot;Q&quot; be the point . It thus makes sense to define the hyperbolic angle from &quot;P&quot; to an arbitrary point on the curve as a logarithmic function of the point&#x27;s value of &quot;x&quot;.

Whereas in Euclidean geometry moving steadily in an orthogonal direction to a ray from the origin traces out a circle, in a pseudo-Euclidean plane steadily moving orthogonally to a ray from the origin traces out a hyperbola. In Euclidean space, the multiple of a given angle traces equal distances around a circle while it traces exponential distances upon the hyperbolic line.

Both circular and hyperbolic angle provide instances of an invariant measure. Arcs with an angular magnitude on a circle generate a measure on certain measurable sets on the circle whose magnitude does not vary as the circle turns or rotates. For the hyperbola the turning is by squeeze mapping, and the hyperbolic angle magnitudes stay the same when the plane is squeezed by a mapping
:(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) ↦ (&quot;rx&quot;, &quot;y&quot; / &quot;r&quot;), with &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 .

===Relation To The Minkowski Line Element===
There is also a curious relation to a hyperbolic angle and the metric defined on Minkowski space. Just as two dimensional Euclidean geometry defines its line element as
:formula_24
the line element on Minkowski space is
:formula_25

Consider a curve embedded in two dimensional Euclidean space,
:formula_26
Where the parameter formula_27 is a real number that runs between formula_28 and formula_29 (formula_30

If formula_22 defines a unit circle, a single parameterized solution set to this equation is formula_32 and formula_33. Letting formula_34, computing the arclength formula_35 gives formula_36. Now doing the same procedure, except replacing the Euclidean element with the Minkowski line element,
:formula_37
and defining a unit hyperbola as formula_38 with its corresponding parameterized solution set formula_39 and formula_40, and by letting formula_41 (the hyperbolic angle), we arrive at the result of formula_42. Just as the circular angle is the length of a circular arc using the Euclidean metric, the hyperbolic angle is the length of a hyperbolic arc using the Minkowski metric.

==History==
The quadrature of the hyperbola is the evaluation of the area of a hyperbolic sector. It can be shown to be equal to the corresponding area against an asymptote. The quadrature was first accomplished by Gregoire de Saint-Vincent in 1647 in &quot;Opus geometricum quadrature circuli et sectionum coni&quot;. As expressed by a historian,
: [He made the] quadrature of a hyperbola to its asymptotes, and showed that as the area increased in arithmetic series the abscissas increased in geometric series.

A. A. de Sarasa interpreted the quadrature as a logarithm and thus the geometrically defined natural logarithm (or &quot;hyperbolic logarithm&quot;) is understood as the area under to the right of . As an example of a transcendental function, the logarithm is more familiar than its motivator, the hyperbolic angle. Nevertheless, the hyperbolic angle plays a role when the theorem of Saint-Vincent is advanced with squeeze mapping.

Circular trigonometry was extended to the hyperbola by Augustus De Morgan in his textbook &quot;Trigonometry and Double Algebra&quot;. In 1878 W.K. Clifford used the hyperbolic angle to parametrize a unit hyperbola, describing it as &quot;quasi-harmonic motion&quot;.

In 1894 Alexander Macfarlane circulated his essay &quot;The Imaginary of Algebra&quot;, which used hyperbolic angles to generate hyperbolic versors, in his book &quot;Papers on Space Analysis&quot;. The following year Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society published Mellen W. Haskell&#x27;s outline of the hyperbolic functions.

When Ludwik Silberstein penned his popular 1914 textbook on the new theory of relativity, he used the rapidity concept based on hyperbolic angle &quot;a&quot;, where , the ratio of velocity &quot;v&quot; to the speed of light. He wrote:

:It seems worth mentioning that to &quot;unit&quot; rapidity corresponds a huge velocity, amounting to 3/4 of the velocity of light; more accurately we have for .
:[...] the rapidity , [...] consequently will represent the velocity .76 &quot;c&quot; which is a little above the velocity of light in water.

Silberstein also uses Lobachevsky&#x27;s concept of angle of parallelism Π(&quot;a&quot;) to obtain .

==Imaginary circular angle==
The hyperbolic angle is often presented as if it were an imaginary number, formula_43 and formula_44 so that the hyperbolic functions cosh and sinh can be presented through the circular functions. But in the Euclidean plane we might alternately consider circular angle measures to be imaginary and hyperbolic angle measures to be real scalars, formula_45 and formula_46

These relationships can be understood in terms of the exponential function, which for a complex argument formula_47 can be broken into even and odd parts formula_48 and formula_49 respectively. Then

formula_50

or if the argument is separated into real and imaginary parts formula_51 the exponential can be split into the product of scaling formula_52 and rotation formula_53

formula_54

As infinite series,

formula_55

The infinite series for cosine is derived from cosh by turning it into an alternating series, and the series for sine comes from making sinh into an alternating series.
