<text>Queluz is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte.

==Geography==

The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraíba do Sul river.
The northeast boundary is shared with two other states, Minas Gerais to the north and Rio de Janeiro to the east.

===Climate===
The climate of Queluz is tropical, the year-round average low temperature is 16 degrees Celsius, and the average high temperature is 26 degrees Celsius.

==History==

The city came from a village of Puri Indians in the year of 1800. The village grew up around a chapel built by Indians and slaves under the leadership of father Francisco das Chagas Lima, who was sent to evangelize the Puri people, where he stands today is the Mother Church. The city was incorporated in 1876. The patron saint of Queluz is St. John the Baptist, and the name Queluz is a tribute to the Imperial Family, sharing the name of the town where D. Pedro I was born. Coffee culture is important to the municipality, as farms still exist in the surrounding countryside of Sertão, São José, Restauração, Bela Aurora, Regato, Cascata, etc.

In 2020, the population was estimated as 13,606 people living in an area of .

==Population history==
==Economy==
The economic development of the municipality is related to farming and the production of toys from wood, leather, and embroidery. The secondary sector have contributed significantly to the region&#x27;s economic development. The presence in the region of Brazil&#x27;s main steel producer, the Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) is advantageous to industry in the region, such as the Volkswagen truck factory in Resende, 32 km from Queluz, and the Peugeot factory in Resende. Industries established in Queluz are exempt from municipal taxes for ten years; the council also supports negotiations with state and federal governments to reduce other taxes. To encourage the development of new industries, the mayor can donate land with infrastructure already available.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>News from Nowhere is an 1890 classic work combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer William Morris. It was first published in serial form in the &quot;Commonweal&quot; journal beginning on 11 January 1890.

In the novel, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the Socialist League and awakes to find himself in a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no marriage or divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work.

The novel explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. Morris fuses Marxism and the romance tradition when he presents himself as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and fellowship—and through them for a reborn self—he encounters romance archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure: a working class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman. The book offers Morris&#x27; answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolition of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work.

In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common criticisms of socialism: the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communist society. Morris&#x27; response is that all work should be creative and pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each worker. &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; was written as a libertarian socialist response to an earlier book called &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, a book that epitomises a kind of state socialism that Morris abhorred. It was also meant to directly influence various currents of thought at the time regarding the tactics to bring about socialism.

== Background: &quot;Looking Backward&quot; ==
Morris reviewed the novel &quot;Looking Backward&quot; in the &quot;Commonweal&quot; on 21 June 1889. In his review, Morris objects to Edward Bellamy&#x27;s portrayal of his imagined society as an authority for what socialists believe. Morris writes,
&#x27;In short a machine life is the best which Mr. Bellamy can imagine for us on all sides; it is not to be wondered at then that this, his only idea for making labour tolerable is to decrease the amount of it by means of fresh and ever fresh developments of machinery … I believe that this will always be so, and the multiplication of machinery will just multiply machinery; I believe that the ideal of the future does not point to the lessening of men&#x27;s energy by the reduction of labour to a minimum, but rather the reduction of pain in labour to a minimum, so small that it will cease to be pain; a dream to humanity which can only be dreamed of till men are even more completely equal than Mr. Bellamy&#x27;s utopia would allow them to be, but which will most assuredly come about when men are really equal in condition.&#x27;

Morris&#x27;s basic antipathy with Bellamy arose chiefly from his disagreement with Bellamy&#x27;s social values and aesthetic convictions. While Bellamy favoured the urban, Morris favoured the pastoral; while Bellamy lauded the Industrial Revolution and the power of the machine, Morris yearned for the restoration of an organic way of life which utilised machines only to alleviate the burdens which humans might find irksome; while Bellamy sought salvation through an omnipotent state, Morris wished for a time when it would have withered away.

More specifically, Morris criticised the limited nature of Bellamy&#x27;s idea of life. He identifies five concerns—work, technology, centralisation, cities, arts—which demonstrates the &quot;half change&quot; advanced in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;. Morris&#x27;s review also contains an alternate future society in each of these instances. This was the framework based on which he would later attempt to elaborate his vision of a utopia in &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;.

==Gender roles==
Of gender and the division of labor, Ruth Levitas writes:
Morris presents us with a society in which women are relatively free from the oppression of men; while domestic work, respected albeit gender-specific in Morris&#x27;s work here as elsewhere, is portrayed as a source of potential pleasure and edification for all denizens of his Utopia.

== Marriage ==
Morris offers a Marxist view of marriage and divorce. Dick and Clara were once married with two children. Then Clara ‘got it in her head she was in love with someone else,’ so she left Dick only to reconcile with him again. Old Hammond informs the reader that there are no courts in &quot;Nowhere&quot;, no divorce in &quot;Nowhere&quot;, and furthermore no contractual marriage in &quot;Nowhere&quot;. When dealing with marriage and divorce Old Hammond explains,
‘You must understand once for all that we have changed these matters; or rather that our way of looking at them has changed…We do not deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we can get rid of all the trouble that besets the sexes… but we are not so mad as to pile up degradation on that unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles about livelihood and position, and the power of tyrannising over the children who have been the result of love or lust.&#x27;
In Nowhere people live in groups of various sizes, as they please, and the nuclear family is not necessary.

Concerning marriage, the people of &quot;Nowhere&quot; practice monogamy but are free to pursue romantic love because they are not bound by a contractual marriage.

== Education ==
Early in the novel we learn that though the people of &quot;Nowhere&quot; are learned there is no formal schooling for children. Although Oxford still exists as a place to study the &#x27;Art of Knowledge&#x27;, we learn that people are free to choose their own form of education. As for educating children, we learn that children in &quot;Nowhere&quot;
‘often make up parties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in the summer time, living in tents, as you see. We rather encourage them to do it; they learn to do things for themselves, and get to know the wild creatures; and you see the less they stew inside houses the better for them.’

Here Morris breaks away from the traditional institutions of 19th century England. Learning through nature is the best suited lifestyle for this agrarian society.

== Decision-making process ==
== Environment ==
== &quot;How We Might Live&quot; ==
&quot;News from Nowhere&quot; is a utopian representation of Morris’ vision of an ideal society. &quot;Nowhere&quot; is in fact a literal translation of the word &quot;utopia&quot;. This Utopia, an imagined society, is idyllic because the people in it are free from the burdens of industrialisation and therefore they find harmony in a lifestyle that coexists with the natural world.

In an 1884 lecture &quot;How We Live and How We Might Live&quot;, Morris gives his opinions about an ideal existence. This opinion is the bedrock for the novel. Morris writes,
&#x27;Before I leave this matter of the surroundings of life, I wish to meet a possible objection. I have spoken of machinery being used freely for releasing people from the more mechanical and repulsive part of necessary labour; it is the allowing of machines to be our masters and not our servants that so injures the beauty of life nowadays. And, again, that leads me to my last claim, which is that the material surroundings of my life should be pleasant, generous, and beautiful; that I know is a large claim, but this I will say about it, that if it cannot be satisfied, if every civilised community cannot provide such surroundings for all its members, I do not want the world to go on.&#x27;

==Influence==

The title &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; has inspired many enterprises, including a political bookstore in Liverpool, Tim Crouch&#x27;s theatre company and a monthly social club. The News from Nowhere Club was founded in 1996 to &quot;challenge the commercialisation and isolation of modern life&quot;, taking as its motto Morris&#x27;s phrase that &quot;Fellowship is life and the lack of fellowship is death.&quot; Its patron is Peter Hennessy, historian of government, and it meets monthly in the church hall of St John the Baptist&#x27;s, Leytonstone, about four km from the house where the artist grew up, now the William Morris Gallery.

Many artistic creations are named News from Nowhere; some of these are closely connected to Morris&#x27;s book, while others simply use the three-word title, or a variant of it. 
The Arts Council funded a short film in 1978, bringing &quot;News to Nowhere&quot; to life, starring Timothy West as Morris. It described a fictional trip by Morris up the River Thames, exploring ideas of aesthetic and socialism. The book was adapted by Sarah Woods as a radio play, broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 25 May 2016.

&quot;News from Nowhere&quot; was an influencing factor in historian G. D. H. Cole&#x27;s conversion to socialism. 
The novel &quot;News from Gardenia&quot; (2012) by Robert Llewellyn was influenced by &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;.
A contemporary art exhibition at the Lucy Mackintosh Gallery in Lausanne, Switzerland, with six British artists: Michael Ashcroft, Juan Bolivar, Andrew Grassie, Justin Hibbs, Alistair Hudson, and Peter Liversidge during April–May 2005 was called &quot;News From Nowhere&quot;. Korean artists Moon Kyungwon and Jeon Joonho were inspired by the novel in their collaborative project &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (2012).

Folk singer Leon Rosselson&#x27;s song &quot;Bringing the News from Nowhere&quot;, from his eponymous 1986 album, is a tribute to Morris. 
A track on &quot;Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!&quot; by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (2008) is called &quot;More News from Nowhere&quot;. 
In 2013 the English band Darkstar released an album titled &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;. 
In 2008 Waltham Forest commissioned the composer, Mike Roberts, to create a new community symphony based on the story. Incorporating Morris&#x27; axiom of &#x27;art for the people and by the people&#x27;, the piece was written in collaboration with 180 primary school children, who composed fragments of music that were weaved into the final piece. The result was a 90-minute work for children&#x27;s choir, orchestra and 10 other smaller ensembles. The work is being recorded with the artistic support of The William Morris Gallery during 2014-15 for release in June 2015 to commemorate the novel&#x27;s 125th anniversary.

The animated video &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (2022, 5 min) by Maltese artist and curator Raphael Vella is loosely inspired by William Morris’s novel. Composed of around 1000 frames, this stop motion animation presents a more dystopian version of the narrative, in which the artist wakes up to a world on fire. The animated video will be on display 2023 at Valletta Contemporary in Malta.

The opera &quot;New Year&quot; by Sir Michael Tippett was strongly influenced by the book.

<text>Queluz () is a former civil parish in the municipality of Sintra, Lisbon District, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Queluz e Belas. The population in 2011 was 26,248, in an area of 3.63 km2. The parish covered part of the city of Queluz.

==History==

On 29 June 1925, the parish of Queluz was created from part of the parish of Belas (article 1, Decree 1:790, 29 June 1925). The parish was elevated to town (&quot;vila&quot;) status on 18 September 1961. In 1997 the parishes Massamá and Monte Abraão were de-annexed from the parish of Queluz, and together they were elevated to city (&quot;cidade&quot;) status.

Since 29 June 2001, the parish council was installed on &quot;Rua Conde de Almeida Araújo&quot;, while the former installations were remodelled, resulting in the &quot;Sala Multiusos Fernando Ribeiro Leitão&quot; (which received artists&#x27; expositions, cultural events and meetings of the parish).

The parish council remodelled the historical public washing-house, a protocol signed between the 23 Group of the &quot;Associação de Escuteiros de Portugal&quot; and the &quot;Grupo Coral de Queluz&quot; (the two entities that now occupy the edifice). In 2004, a shop along &quot;Avenida da República&quot;, was acquired to decentralize services.

<doc id="1142991" wikidata="Q6422285" url="?curid=1142991" title="Knight Templar (The Saint)">
<text>Knight Templar is the title of a mystery novel by Leslie Charteris first published in October 1930. This was the fourth book—and third full novel—featuring Charteris&#x27;s Robin Hood-inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar, alias &quot;The Saint&quot;. The title of the book is a pun on the religious organization Knights Templar. Later editions were titled The Avenging Saint and the book is also well known by this title, which was first used in a 1931 edition.

==Plot summary==
The novel, a direct sequel to its predecessor, &quot;The Last Hero&quot; sees Templar and his organization taking revenge on an arms dealer named Rayt Marius, following the death of one of Templar&#x27;s friends.

The book starts approximately three months after the events of &quot;The Last Hero&quot;. Simon Templar and his associate, Roger Conway, have been spending much of that time chasing Marius and his superior, Prince Rudolf (Crown Prince of an unidentified country) across Europe. Templar suspects that Marius and Rudolf are planning to follow through with their scheme to spark a new World War (continuing from &quot;The Last Hero&quot;), and in any event, Templar has sworn to kill whichever of the two men murdered his friend Norman Kent at the close of the previous adventure.

Although Templar had been forced to flee England at the end of the previous novel, he has since found himself back in Britain and again on the trail of Marius. While executing a scheme to root Marius out from hiding by infiltrating a bogus nursing home, Templar and Conway rescue who they initially think is an elderly man held prisoner by one of Marius&#x27;s compatriots; Templar soon discovers that they&#x27;ve actually rescued the beautiful daughter of a millionaire upon whose safety relies world peace. The woman, Sonia Delmar, subsequently joins Templar&#x27;s fight against Marius (who Templar learns is the man who killed Norman) and Prince Rudolf, even going so far as to allowing herself to be kidnapped by the villains.

Templar is said to be 29 years old in this tale.

In this book, Sonia Delmar becomes the romantic female lead, replacing Templar&#x27;s girlfriend of the previous books, Patricia Holm, who is referenced only briefly in the story as being on a cruise in the Mediterranean (this same excuse was used by Charteris to remove the character from much of the action in &quot;Enter the Saint&quot; as well). This was the first book to indicate the &quot;open&quot; nature of Templar and Holm&#x27;s relationship, although in this case Templar makes clear that his heart remains with Holm.

The final chapter of the book contains a somewhat metafictional reference in that Templar indicates his intent to give his notes regarding the Marius affair to &quot;a writer friend&quot; with the idea of his turning them into a novel—a reference to Leslie Charteris himself. (This same literary device has also been employed by the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle in his Sherlock Holmes books and Ian Fleming in his James Bond novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.) And finally, perhaps in a nod to the developing continuity of the &quot;series&quot;, Charteris brings Detective-Inspector Carn (MEET THE TIGER) back for a brief reunion with Templar at the climax.

A later Saint novel, &quot;Getaway&quot;, completed the trilogy begun by &quot;The Last Hero&quot; and &quot;Knight Templar&quot;. The ultimate fate of Rayt Marius would be revealed in the novella &quot;The Simon Templar Foundation&quot; in &quot;The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal&quot;.

<text>Norte Pequeno is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Calheta in the Portuguese Azores, located on the northern coast of the island of São Jorge. The population in 2011 was 220, in an area of 12.11 km2. It contains the localities Canada do Ponte and Norte Pequeno.

==History==

This settlement was originally formed by peoples from the village of Calheta, around 1690; this is conjecture, based on the construction of the village chapel, which was built to evoke São Lázaro. This chapel became the base for the current parochial Church of São Lázaro, which grew and was emancipated from the church in Calheta around 1758. The original church was destroyed in the 1757 earthquake, which was responsible for the destruction and deaths in most of the eastern part of the island. The current church was constructed through the initiative of Father Nicolau António and completed by José d’Avellar de Mello in 1761.

==Geography==
Norte Pequeno, straddles both the central plain and coastal area, which is dotted with fajãs (coastal debris fields) that include: Fajã da Penedia, Fajã das Pontas, Fajã do Mero and Fajã da Neca, which are accessible by foot or pack-animal from the neighboring Fajã dos Cubres, Ribeira Seca. Location of a natural spring, Fajã da Penedia, is one of the less-visited settlements on the island but one of the more historically natural; it has a small chapel constructed in 1890, several small cottages and a recently remodeled communitarian stove, but the fajã has no electricity and telephones. Similar to some of the other fajãs in the north, this area is recognized for generally unspoiled nature and coastal lakes with shrimp and clam beds.

Although a small population, it is still a nucleus of the educational system (having a primary school), as well as many of its own independent infrastructures, including Casa do Povo, Salão Paroquial, Corpo Nacional de Escuteiros (Agrupamento No.223) and a modern factory branch of the Cooperativa Agrícola, where they manufacture cheese. The community is also known for Filarmónica Recreio de São Lázaro (formed in 1981), one of the many philharmonic bands in the region.

==Culture==
The parish celebrates two important days on the religious calendar: on August 15, the festival in honour of Nossa Senhora do Rosário, and on 17 of December the feast day of São Lázaro, where residents also celebrate the creation of its band.

<text>Matthew Alan Chapman (born November 1, 1976) and Michael Raymond Chapman (born September 20, 1973), known collectively as The Brothers Chaps, are American writers, voice actors, directors, animators, producers and composers. They are best known as the creators of the animated series &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; and &quot;Two More Eggs&quot;.

==Early life==
While Matt and Mike Chapman were born in Indiana, they grew up in Decatur, Georgia and later resided in Atlanta. Growing up in the 1980s, the Brothers Chaps were creating comic books, filming Super 8 movies and eventually toying with a video camera. 

Mike attended the University of Georgia and studied photography, while Matt went to film school at Florida State University.

==Career==
Mike Chapman created the character of Homestar Runner in 1996 with friend Craig Zobel. The character debuted in the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest,&quot; which was subsequently posted online as a series of images. In 2000, the Brothers Chaps began to create cartoons with the character using Adobe Flash. As the series progressed, more characters were added to the series and spin-off series were created, notably &quot;Strong Bad Emails&quot; in 2001. During production of &quot;Homestar Runner,&quot; Matt has been the primary voice actor for the titular character as well as characters like Strong Bad. Mike has been responsible for much of the animation, as well as the technical aspects of the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; site. Both brothers contributed to the writing and direction of the series.

For a time, Matt Chapman worked as a writer and director for the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!.&quot; He also worked for the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; and The Hub live-action series &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, where he also contributed occasional voice work and supporting acting roles. Matt wrote the &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot; episodes &quot;The Bounty&quot; and &quot;The Timebomb&quot; in collaboration with the show&#x27;s writing staff. Matt also appeared in the second-season finale of &quot;Camp Camp&quot;, an animated series by Rooster Teeth, as the voice of Neil&#x27;s father, Carl.

Mike also provides intentionally poor imitations of his brother&#x27;s voice work for the &quot;Powered by The Cheat&quot; cartoon series on the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; website. In addition, he has served as a writer for &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;, and — like his brother Matt — has collaborated with the &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot; staff, credited for writing the episode &quot;The Liar&quot;.

The brothers had a general development deal with Disney Television Animation, and developed a series of short animations for Disney XD titled &quot;Two More Eggs&quot; which ran from 2015 to 2017. They have directed several music videos, including &quot;Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse&quot; by Of Montreal, &quot;Experimental Film&quot; (featuring the Homestar Runner characters, most notably Strong Sad) and &quot;Figure Eight&quot; by They Might Be Giants, &quot;Brand of Skin&quot; by Folk Implosion, and &quot;LA Lindsay&quot; by Y-O-U, the band who also collaborated with the brothers on &quot;Strong Bad Sings&quot;. In 2017, the duo along with Robert Schneider and James Husband formed the Air-sea Dolphin project, which had two split singles with Honey Radar and the fictional band &quot;Sloshy&quot; from the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; universe.

He played for the New Zealand national cricket team, captaining the team in 1999 with the injury of regular captain Stephen Fleming. Nash was a right-arm fast medium bowler, taking 93 Test wickets in a career spanning from 1992 to 2001. He became the first player in history to take ten wickets and score 50 runs in a match at the Lord&#x27;s ground in 1994. He was a member of the New Zealand team that won the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.

==Suspension==
On the 1995 tour to South Africa, Nash was suspended for smoking cannabis along with future captain Stephen Fleming and team-mate Matthew Hart.

==Beyond cricket==
In June 2005, Nash was named as one of the national selectors. In 2008 he became a batsman/bowler for the official New Zealand Beach Cricket Team.

Nash also played Australian rules football in the Auckland Australian Football League, where he was a premiership player with the Mt Roskill Saints.

==Business career==
After retiring from cricket, Nash was a salesman for spring water brand 420. He held a 25% stake in the business before Bacardi bought the parent vodka brand 42 Below. He then founded skincare brand Triumph &amp; Disaster in 2011, exploiting a lack of moisturisers aimed at men.

==Personal life==

<text>The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life (, paperback, 1993) is a health book written by computer scientist Ray Kurzweil and published in 1993. In the book, he explains to readers &quot;How to Reduce Fat in Your Diet and Eliminate Virtually All Risk of Heart Disease and Cancer&quot;. Some of his recommendations have been updated and revised in subsequent years, particularly in his newer books: &quot;Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever&quot; and &quot;Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever&quot;.

==Summary==
Atherosclerosis is a disease which is characterized by a progressive buildup of rigid material inside artery walls and channels. Eventually, they become so clogged that blood flow is stopped and the victim suffers a heart attack. This disease is caused by excess cholesterol in the bloodstream and afflicts approximately ninety percent of Americans, though it is a gradual process and may not even be detectable until later life.

Kurzweil cites various studies showing that increased levels of atherosclerosis in the U.S. and other western countries are linked to high levels of caloric fat intake. In much of Asia, fat intake is around ten percent of total food energy consumed, and heart disease there is almost nonexistent. Kurzweil goes on to show that in America, closer to forty percent of caloric intake is from fat.

Numerous agencies such as the American Dietetic Association, American Heart Association and Surgeon General of the United States advocate thirty percent of caloric intake from fat. However, Kurzweil says this causes a comparatively slight reduction in atherosclerosis levels. He says that he thinks these agencies use an artificially high figure because they assume that nobody would even attempt to attain a lower level if it were recommended.

Kurzweil advocates, based on his findings, only ten percent caloric intake be from fat. Hence, &quot;The 10% Solution&quot;. He says that these levels not only prevent Atherosclerosis but cause its reversal in existing cases. This also apparently lowers the chance of other diseases including cancer, strokes, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. He believes that eating a diet that is very low in fat reduces the risk of most major cancers by 90 percent or more. Kurzweil also claims it increases energy and leads to a generally happier life. Further he gives advice for exercise, suggesting walking, because it is low-impact, and easy for anyone to do.

==Foods to avoid==
* High-sugar jams
* High-fat cheese
* Sweets (high in fat)
* Butter and margarine
* Eggs (high in cholesterol)
* Oil-based dressings (better: balsamic vinegar)
* Cakey muffins and croissant-type pastries (full of butter)
* Too much meat (particularly red meat), organ meats (like liver, brain)
* Vitamin and mineral supplements that include iron, and so-called &quot;fortified&quot; foods which have added iron.

<text>A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel. It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product, but may also be a plant where steel semi-finished casting products are made from molten pig iron or from scrap.

==History==
Since the invention of the Bessemer process, steel mills have replaced ironworks, based on puddling or fining methods. New ways to produce steel appeared later: from scrap melted in an electric arc furnace and, more recently, from direct reduced iron processes.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the world&#x27;s largest steel mill was the Barrow Hematite Steel Company steelworks located in Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom. Today, the world&#x27;s largest steel mill is in Gwangyang, South Korea.

==Integrated mill==


An integrated steel mill has all the functions for primary steel 
production:
* iron making (conversion of ore to liquid iron), 
* steel making (conversion of pig iron to liquid steel), 
* casting (solidification of the liquid steel),
* roughing rolling/billet rolling (reducing size of blocks)
* product rolling (finished shapes).

The principal raw materials for an integrated mill are iron ore, limestone, and coal (or coke). These materials are charged in batches into a blast furnace where the iron compounds in the ore give up excess oxygen and become liquid iron. At intervals of a few hours, the accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast into pig iron or directed to other vessels for further steel making operations. Historically the Bessemer process was a major advancement in the production of economical steel, but it has now been entirely replaced by other processes such as the basic oxygen furnace.

Molten steel is cast into large blocks called &quot;blooms&quot;. During the casting process various methods are used, such as addition of aluminum, so that impurities in the steel float to the surface where they can be cut off the finished bloom.

Because of the energy cost and structural stress associated with heating and cooling a blast furnace, typically these primary steel making vessels will operate on a continuous production campaign of several years duration. Even during periods of low steel demand, it may not be feasible to let the blast furnace grow cold, though some adjustment of the production rate is possible.

Integrated mills are large facilities that are typically only economical to build in 2,000,000-ton per year annual capacity and up. Final products made by an integrated plant are usually large structural sections, heavy plate, strip, wire rod, railway rails, and occasionally long products such as bars and pipe.

A major environmental hazard associated with integrated steel mills is the pollution produced in the manufacture of coke, which is an essential intermediate product in the reduction of iron ore in a blast furnace.

Integrated mills may also adopt some of the processes used in mini-mills, such as arc furnaces and direct casting, to reduce production costs.

==Minimill==
A minimill is traditionally a secondary steel producer; however, Nucor (one of the world&#x27;s largest steel producers) and Commercial Metals Company (CMC) use minimills exclusively. Usually it obtains most of its iron from scrap steel, recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing. Direct reduced iron (DRI) is sometimes used with scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually DRI is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material. A typical mini-mill will have an electric arc furnace for scrap melting, a ladle furnace or vacuum furnace for precision control of chemistry, a strip or billet continuous caster for converting molten steel to solid form, a reheat furnace and a rolling mill.

Originally the minimill was adapted to production of bar products only, such as concrete reinforcing bar, flats, angles, channels, pipe, and light rails. Since the late 1980s, successful introduction of the direct strip casting process has made minimill production of strip feasible. Often a minimill will be constructed in an area with no other steel production, to take advantage of local markets, resources, or lower-cost labour. Minimill plants may specialize, for example, in making coils of rod for wire-drawing use, or pipe, or in special sections for transportation and agriculture.

Capacities of minimills vary: some plants may make as much as 3,000,000 tons per year, a typical size is in the range 200,000 to 400,000 tons per year, and some old or specialty plants may make as little as 50,000 tons per year of finished product. Nucor Corporation, for example, annually produces around 9,100,000 tons of sheet steel from its four sheet mills, 6,700,000 tons of bar steel from its 10 bar mills and 2,100,000 tons of plate steel from its two plate mills.

Since the electric arc furnace can be easily started and stopped on a regular basis, minimills can follow the market demand for their products easily, operating on 24-hour schedules when demand is high and cutting back production when sales are lower.

<text>Hungarian prehistory () spans the period of history of the Hungarian people, or Magyars, which started with the separation of the Hungarian language from other Finno-Ugric or Ugric languages around , and ended with the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around . Based on the earliest records of the Magyars in Byzantine, Western European, and Hungarian chronicles, scholars considered them for centuries to have been the descendants of the ancient Scythians and Huns. This historiographical tradition disappeared from mainstream history after the realization of similarities between the Hungarian language and the Uralic languages in the late . Thereafter, linguistics became the principal source of the study of the Hungarians&#x27; ethnogenesis. In addition, chronicles written between the , the results of archaeological research and folklore analogies provide information on the Magyars&#x27; early history. After the 2000s, archaeological research aimed at exploring the early history of the Hungarians resumed in the Ural Mountains region. Today, these efforts are regularly supplemented with archaeogenetic studies. In addition to linguistics, archaeology, and archaeogenetics, the re-evaluation of well-known written sources has also begun. Together, these fields of study may provide new information regarding the origins of the Hungarian people.

Study of pollen in fossils based on cognate words for certain treesincluding larch and elmin the daughter languages suggests the speakers of the Proto-Uralic language lived in the wider region of the Ural Mountains, which were inhabited by scattered groups of Neolithic hunter-gatherers in the . They spread over vast territories, which caused the development of a separate Proto-Finno-Ugric language by the end of the millennium. Linguistic studies and archaeological research evidence that those who spoke this language lived in pit-houses and used decorated clay vessels. The expansion of marshlands after around caused new migrations. No scholarly consensus on the &quot;Urheimat&quot;, or original homeland, of the Ugric peoples exists: they lived either in the region of the Tobol River or along the Kama River and the upper courses of the Volga River around . They lived in settled communities, cultivated millet, wheat, and other crops, and bred animalsespecially horses, cattle, and pigs. Loan words connected to animal husbandry from Proto-Iranian show that they had close contacts with their neighbors. The southernmost Ugric groups adopted a nomadic way of life by around , because of the northward expansion of the steppes.

The development of the Hungarian language started around with the withdrawal of the grasslands and the parallel southward migration of the nomadic Ugric groups. The history of the ancient Magyars during the next thousand years is uncertain; they lived in the steppes but the location of their &quot;Urheimat&quot; is subject to scholarly debates. According to one theory, they initially lived east of the Urals and migrated west to &quot;Magna Hungaria&quot; by at the latest. Other scholars say Magna Hungaria was the Magyars&#x27; original homeland, from where they moved either to the region of the Don River or towards the Kuban River before the . Hundreds of loan words adopted from Oghuric Turkic languages prove the Magyars were closely connected to Turkic peoples. Byzantine and Muslim authors regarded them as a Turkic people in the .

An alliance between the Magyars and the Bulgarians in the late 830s was the first historical event that was recorded with certainty in connection with the Magyars. According to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the Magyars lived in Levedia in the vicinity of the Khazar Khaganate in the early and supported the Khazars in their wars &quot;for three years&quot;. The Magyars were organized into tribes, each headed by their own &quot;voivodes&quot;, or military leaders. After a Pecheneg invasion against Levedia, a group of Magyars crossed the Caucasus Mountains and settled in the lands south of the mountains, but the majority of the people fled to the steppes north of the Black Sea. From their new homeland, which was known as Etelköz, the Magyars controlled the lands between the Lower Danube and the Don River in the 870s. The confederation of their seven tribes was led by two supreme chiefs, the &quot;kende&quot; and the &quot;gyula&quot;. The Kabarsa group of rebellious subjects of the Khazar turksjoined the Magyars in Etelköz. The Magyars regularly invaded the neighboring Slavic tribes, forcing them to pay a tribute and seizing prisoners to be sold to the Byzantines. Taking advantage of the wars between Bulgaria, East Francia, and Moravia, they invaded Central Europe at least four times between 861 and 894. A new Pecheneg invasion compelled the Magyars to leave Etelköz, cross the Carpathian Mountains, and settle in the Carpathian Basin around 895.

== Ethnonyms ==
The Hungarians were mentioned under various ethnic names in Arabic, Byzantine, Slavic, and Western European sources in the 9th and 10th centuries. Arabic scholars referred to them as &quot;Magyars&quot;, &quot;Bashkirs&quot;, or &quot;Turks&quot;; Byzantine authors mentioned them as &quot;Huns&quot;, &quot;Ungrs&quot;, &quot;Turks&quot;, or &quot;Savards&quot;; Slavic sources used the ethnonyms &quot;Ugr&quot; or &quot;Peon&quot;, and Western European authors wrote of &quot;Hungrs&quot;, &quot;Pannons&quot;, &quot;Avars&quot;, &quot;Huns&quot;, &quot;Turks&quot;, and &quot;Agaren&quot;. According to the linguist Gyula Németh, the multiple ethnonymsespecially &quot;Ungr&quot;, &quot;Savard&quot;, and &quot;Turk&quot;reflect that the Magyars had been integrated in various empires of the Eurasian steppesthe tribal confederations of the Onogurs and of the Sabirs, and the Göktürksbefore gaining their independence. The designation Bashkirs likely comes from proximity to the Turkic-speaking Bashkirs, a group which still today remains in the southern Urals.

Ibn Rusta was the first to record a variant of the Hungarians&#x27; self-designation; &quot;(al-Madjghariyya)&quot;. According to a scholarly theory, the ethnonym &quot;Magyar&quot; is a composite word. The first part of the word &quot;(magy-)&quot; is said to have been connected to several recorded or hypothetical words, including the Mansi&#x27;s self-designation &quot;(māńśi)&quot; and a reconstructed Ugric word for man &quot;(*mańća)&quot;. The second part &quot;(-er&quot; or &quot;-ar)&quot; may have developed from a reconstructed Finno-Ugrian word for man or boy &quot;(*irkä)&quot; or from a Turkic word with a similar meaning &quot;(eri&quot; or &quot;iri)&quot;. Alan W. Ertl writes that the ethnonym was initially the name of a smaller group, the Megyer tribe; it developed into an ethnonym because Megyer was the most powerful tribe within the people. Most scholars agree that the Hungarian exonym and its variants were derived from the Onogurs&#x27; name. This form started spreading in Europe with Slavic mediation.

== Formation of the Magyar people ==

=== Before the separation of the Hungarian language (before 800 BC) ===


Hungarian has traditionally been classified as an Ugric language within the family of Uralic languages, but alternative views exist. For instance, linguist Tapani Salminen rejects the existence of a Proto-Ugric language, saying Hungarian was a member of an &quot;areal genetic unit&quot; that also included Permic languages. Paleolinguistic research suggests the speakers of the Proto-Uralic language lived in a territory where four treeslarch, silver fir, spruce, and elmgrew together. The study of pollen in fossils shows these trees could be found on both sides of the Ural Mountains along the rivers Ob, Pechora, and Kama in the . The land between the Urals and the Kama was sparsely inhabited during this period. From around , the Neolithic material culture of the wider region of the Urals spread over vast territories to the west and east. Regional variants emerged, showing the appearance of groups of people who had no close contact with each other.

About 1000 basic words of the Hungarian languageincluding the names of the seasons and natural phenomena, and the most frequently used verbshad cognates in other Finno-Ugric languages, suggesting the temporary existence of a Proto-Finno-Ugric language. Between around 2600 and , climatic changes caused the spread of swamps on both sides of the Urals, forcing groups of inhabitants to leave their homelands. The Finno-Ugric linguistic unity disappeared and new languages emerged around . Whether the groups speaking the language from which Hungarian emerged lived to the east or to the west of the Urals in this period is debated by historians.

Further climate changes occurring between 1300 and caused the northward expansion of the steppes by about , compelling the southernmost Ugric groups to adopt a nomadic lifestyle. Around , the climate again changed with the beginning of a wetter period, forcing the nomadic Ugric groups to start a southward migration, following the grasslands. Their movement separated them from the northern Ugric groups, which gave rise to the development of the language from which modern Hungarian emerged. According to historian László Kontler, the concept of the &quot;sky-high tree&quot; and some other elements of Hungarian folklore seem to have been inherited from the period of the Finno-Ugric unity. The melodies of the most common Hungarian funeral songs show similarities to tunes of Khanty epic songs.

=== Original homeland ( 800 BCbefore 600 AD) ===
The stag and the eagle, which are popular motifs of 10th-century Magyar art, have close analogies in Scythian art. The Scythians, Sarmatians, and other Indo-Iranian speaking peoples dominated the Eurasian steppes between around and . During this period, all ethnic groups in the steppes were nomads with almost identical material cultures, for which the certain identification of the Magyars is impossible. Consequently, the exact location of their original homeland is subject to scholarly debates. Róna-Tas says the development of Hungarian started in the region of the rivers Kama and Volga, west of the Urals. Archaeologist István Fodor writes that the original homeland lay to the east of the Urals. He says that some features of the &quot;tumuli&quot; erected at Chelyabinsk in the , including the northward orientation of the heads of the deceased and the geometric motifs on the clay vessels put in the graves, are similar to older burials that he attributes to Ugric peoples.

== Migrations ==

=== Early westward migrations (before 600 AD 750 or 830 AD) ===

In the 1230s, Friar Julian went to search for the Magyars&#x27; legendary homeland Magna Hungaria after reading about it and a group of Magyars who had remained there in a Hungarian chronicle. He met a Hungarian-speaking group &quot;beside the great Etil river&quot; (the Volga or the Kama) in the land of the Volga Bulgars, in or in the wider region of present-day Bashkortostan in Eastern Europe. Whether Magna Hungaria was the original homeland of the Magyars, or whether the Magyars&#x27; ancestors settled in Magna Hungaria after their migration to Europe from their Western Siberian original homeland is still subject to scholarly debates. According to a third scholarly theory, Magna Hungaria was neither the Magyars&#x27; original homeland nor their first homeland in Europe. Instead, the ancestors of the Eastern Magyars whom Friar Julian met had moved to Magna Hungaria from the south.

According to a scholarly theory, the name of at least one Magyar tribe, Gyarmat, is connected to the name of a Bashkir group, Yurmatï. Specific burial ritesthe use of death masks and the placing of parts of horses into the gravesfeaturing a 9th- or 10th-century cemetery at the confluence of the Volga and Kama near present-day Bolshie Tigany in Tatarstan are also evidenced among the Magyars who lived in the Carpathian Basin in the . Most specialists say that the cemetery at Bolshie Tigany was used by Magyars who either remained in Magna Hungaria when other Magyar groups left the territory, or who moved there from other regions which were inhabited by the Magyars during their migrations.

If the Magyars&#x27; original homeland was situated in Western Siberia, instead of being identical with Magna Hungaria, their ancestors moved from Western Siberia to Eastern Europe. This must have happened between and , because there were several major movements of peoples across the steppes during this period. The &quot;Prohorovo culture&quot; spread towards modern-day Bashkortostan around . The westward migration of the Huns forced many groups of people of Western Siberia to depart for Europe between about 350 and . The Avars&#x27; attack against the Sabirs in Siberia set in motion a number of migrations in the 460s. Between around 550 and 600, the migration of the Avars towards Europe compelled many nomadic groups to move.

The arrival of the Huns ended the dominance of Iranian peoples in the Eurasian steppes. Thereafter the Sabirs, Avars, Onoghurs, Khazars, and other Turkic peoples controlled the grasslands of Eastern Europe for centuries. Gardizi described the Magyars as &quot;a branch of the Turks&quot;; Leo the Wise and Constantine Porphyrogenitus called them Turks. About 450 Hungarian words were borrowed from Turkic languages before around 900. The oldest layer of Hungarian folk songs show similarities to Chuvash songs. These facts show the Magyars were closely connected to the Turks while they stayed in the Pontic steppes.

Gyula Németh, András Róna-Tas and other scholars write that for centuries, the Magyars lived around the Kuban River, to the north of the Caucasus Mountains. They say it was there that the Magyars adopted the Turkic terminology of viticulture, including &quot;bor&quot; (&quot;wine&quot;) and &quot;seprő&quot; (&quot;dregs&quot;), and the Turkic names of cornel &quot;(som)&quot;, grapes &quot;(szőlő)&quot; and some other fruits. According to these scholars, the Hungarian words of Alanic originincluding &quot;asszony&quot; (&quot;lady&quot;, originally &quot;noble or royal lady&quot;)were also borrowed in the same region.

===Levedia ( 750 or 830 850)===

The Khazar Khaganate was the dominant power in the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Volga after around 650. Archaeological finds show that the Khagans controlled a multi-ethnic empire. The &quot;Saltovo-Mayaki culture&quot;, which flourished in the same region around 750 and 900, had at least seven variants. In the Hungarian chronicles, the legend of the wondrous hind seems to have preserved the memory of the Magyars&#x27; &quot;close symbiosis, intermarriages, and incipient fusion&quot; with various ethnic groupsAlans, Bulgars, and Onogursof this large region.

Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote that the Magyars &quot;had of old their dwelling next to Chazaria, in the place called Levedia,&quot; adding that &quot;a river Chidmas, also called Chingilous&quot; ran through this territory. The identification of the (one or two) rivers is uncertain. Porphyrogenitus associated Levedia with the whole territory dominated by the Magyars, but most modern historians agree that he only described a smaller region situated on the Don River. The period when the Magyars settled in Levedia is also uncertain; this happened either before 750 (István Fodor) or around 830 (Gyula Kristó). Porphyrogenitus said that the Magyars had been named &quot;Sabartoi asphaloi&quot;, or &quot;steadfast Savarts&quot;, while staying in Levedia. Róna-Tas says the ethnonym is an invented term with no historical credibility. Based on the same denomination, Károly Czeglédy, Dezső Dümmerth, Victor Spinei, and other historians associated the Magyars either with the late 6th-century Sabirs or with the Suvar tribe of the Volga Bulgars.

Porphyrogenitus wrote that the Magyars &quot;lived together with the Chazars for three years, and fought in alliance with the Chazars in all their wars&quot;, which suggests that the Magyars were subjugated to the Khazar Khagan, according to a scholarly view. On the other hand, historian György Szabados says, the emperor&#x27;s words prove the equal position of the Magyars and the Khazars, instead of the Magyars&#x27; subjugation to the Khagan. Although the emperor said that the Magyars&#x27; cohabitation with the Khazars lasted only for three years, modern historians tend to propose a longer period (20, 30, 100, 150, 200 or even 300 years).

According to a memorial stone erected in or before 831, a Bulgarian military commander named Okorsis drowned in the Dnieper during a military campaign. Florin Curta says this inscription may be the first clue&#x27; to the upheaval on the steppes created by the migration of the Magyars into the lands between the Dnieper and the Danube&quot;. The earliest certainly identifiable events of the Magyars&#x27; history occurred in the 830s. The Bulgarians hired them to fight against their Byzantine prisoners, who rebelled and tried to return to Macedonia in the late 830s, but the Byzantines routed them on the banks on the Lower Danube. According to the &quot;Annals of St. Bertin&quot;, Rus&#x27; envoys who visited Constantinople in 839 could only return to their homeland through the Carolingian Empire because &quot;the route by which they had reached Constantinople had taken them through primitive tribes that were very fierce and savage&quot;; Curta and Kristó identify those tribes with the Magyars. Ibn Rusta wrote that the Khazars &quot;used to be protected from attack by the Magyars and other neighboring peoples&quot; by a ditch. According to a scholarly theory, Ibn Rusta&#x27;s report shows that the Khazar fort at Sarkel, which was built in the 830s, was one of the forts protecting the Khazars against the Magyars.

According to Porphyrogenitus, In Levedia, the Magyars &quot;were seven clans, but they had never had over them a prince either native or foreign, but there were among them &#x27;voivodes, or chiefs. Although the exact meaning of the term the emperor used &quot;(genea)&quot; cannot be exactly determined, scholars have traditionally considered the Magyar &quot;clans&quot; or &quot;tribes&quot; as ethnic and territorial units. In the Hungarian chronicles, references to &quot;seven leading persons&quot; or &quot;seven captains&quot; denote the existence of seven Magyar tribes.

Porphyrogenitus said the tribes did not &quot;obey their own particular [voivodes], but [had] a joint agreement to fight together with all earnestness and wheresoever war breaks out&quot;, suggesting the tribal chiefs were military rather than political leaders. According to Kristó, the emperor&#x27;s report also shows the tribal confederation was not a &quot;solid political formation with strong cohesion&quot; in the early 9th century. The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; referred to the seven Magyar chiefs as &quot;Hetumoger&quot;, or &quot;Seven Magyars&quot;. Similar ethnonymsincluding Toquz Oghuz (&quot;Nine Oghuzes&quot;) and Onogur (&quot;Ten Ogurs&quot;)suggest the &quot;Gesta&quot; preserved the name of the confederation of the Magyar tribes. According to Porphyrogenitus, Levedia was named after Levedi, one of the Magyar voivodes. During Levedi&#x27;s life, the Kangars, a distinct group within the Pechenegs&#x27; tribal confederation whom the Khazars had expelled from their homeland, invaded Levedia and forced the Magyars to cede the territory. A Magyar group fled across the Caucasus Mountains as far as Persia. However, the masses departed for the West and settled in a region called Etelköz. Most historians agree the Magyars&#x27; forced exodus from Levedia occurred around 850.

===Etelköz ( 850 895)===
Constantine Porphyrogenitus identified Etelköz (actually Ἀτελκούζου from Ἐτὲλ and Κουζοῦ) with the lands where the rivers &quot;Barouch&quot;, &quot;Koubou&quot;, &quot;Troullos&quot;, &quot;Broutos&quot;, and &quot;Seretos&quot; run. The identification of the last three rivers with the Dniester, the Prut, and the Siret is without debate, but the traditional identification of the Barouch with the Dnieper and the Koubou with the Southern Bug is disputed by Spinei. Al-Jayyani wrote that the Magyars&#x27; territory was located between two rivers named &quot;tl&quot; and &quot;dwb&quot; in the 870s. According to modern scholars, &quot;tl&quot; may refer to the Volga, the Don, or the Dnieper; &quot;dwb&quot; is identified as the Danube. According to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, the Magyars lived in &quot;Scythia&quot; or &quot;Dentumoger&quot;; the latter name, which refers to the Don River, suggests the Magyars inhabited the eastern regions of the Pontic steppes, according to Spinei. János Harmatta infers that &quot;Dentu&quot; (reconstructed as Dentü, ) was the Proto-Hungarian name of the river.

The Khazar Khagan sent his envoys to the Magyars shortly after they fled from Levedia and settled in Etelköz, according to Porphyrogenitus. The Khagan invited Levedi to a meeting, proposing to make Levedi the supreme head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes in exchange for the acceptance of his suzerainty. Instead of accepting the offer, Levedi suggested the new rank should be offered to another voivode, Álmos, or the latter&#x27;s son, Árpád. The Khagan accepted Levedi&#x27;s proposal and upon his demand the Magyar chiefs proclaimed Árpád their head. According to Kristó and Spinei, Porphyrogenitus&#x27; report preserved the memory of the creation of a central office within the federation of the Magyar tribes. Róna-Tas says the story relates only a &quot;change of dynasty&quot;; the fall of Levedi&#x27;s family and the emergence of the Árpád dynasty. In contrast with Porphyrogenitus&#x27;s story, the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; says it was not Árpád, but his father who was elected the first supreme prince of the Magyars.

According to Muslim scholars, the Magyars had two supreme leaders, the &quot;kende&quot; and the &quot;gyula&quot;, the latter being their ruler in the 870s. Their report implies the Khagan granted a Khazar title to the head of the federation of the Magyar tribes; Ibn Fadlan recorded that the third Khazar dignitary was styled &quot;kündür&quot; in the 920s. The Muslim scholar&#x27;s report also implies the Magyars adopted the Khazar system of &quot;dual kingship&quot;, whereby supreme power was divided between a sacred ruler (the &quot;kende&quot;) and a military leader (the &quot;gyula&quot;).

Porphyrogenitus wrote that the Kabarsa group of Khazars who rebelled against the Khaganjoined the Magyars in Etelköz at an unspecified time, suggesting that the Magyars had got rid of the Khagan&#x27;s suzerainty. The Kabars were organized into three tribes, but a single chieftain commanded them. Porphyrogenitus also wrote that the Kabars &quot;were promoted to be first&quot; tribe, because they showed themselves &quot;the strongest and most valorous&quot; of the tribes. Accordingly, the Kabars formed the Magyars&#x27; vanguard, because nomadic peoples always placed the associated tribes in the most vulnerable position.

Ibn Rusta wrote that the Magyars subjected the neighboring Slavic peoples, imposing &quot;a heavy tribute on them&quot; and treating them as prisoners. The Magyars also &quot;made piratical raids on the Slavs&quot; and sold those captured during these raids to the Byzantines in Kerch on the Crimean peninsula. A band of Magyar warriors attacked the future Saint Cyril the Philosopher &quot;howling like wolves and wishing to kill him&quot; in the steppes near the Crimea, according to the saint&#x27;s legend. However, Cyril convinced them to &quot;release him and his entire retinue in peace&quot;. The inhabitants of the regions along the left bank of the Dniesterwhom the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot; identified as Tivertsifortified their settlements in the second half of the 9th century, which seems to be connected to the Magyars&#x27; presence.

A plundering raid in East Francia in 862 was the Magyars&#x27; first recorded military expedition in Central Europe. This raid may have been initiated by Rastislav of Moravia, who was at war with Louis the German, according to Róna-Tas and Spinei. The longer version of the &quot;Annals of Salzburg&quot; said the Magyars returned to East Francia and ransacked the region of Vienna in 881. The same source separately mentioned the &quot;Cowari&quot;, or Kabars, plundering the region of Kulmberg or Kollmitz in the same year, showing that the Kabars formed a distinct group. In the early 880s, a &quot;king&quot; of the Magyars had an amicable meeting with Methodius, Archbishop of Moravia, who was returning from Constantinople to Moravia, according to Methodius&#x27; legend.

===The Hungarian Conquest ( 895907)===


The Magyars returned to Central Europe in July 892, when they invaded Moravia in alliance with Arnulf, king of East Francia. Two years later, they stormed into the March of Pannonia. According to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, they &quot;killed men and old women outright, and carried out the young women along with them like cattle to satisfy their lusts&quot;. Although this source does not refer to an alliance between the Magyars and Svatopluk I of Moravia, most historians agree the Moravian ruler persuaded them to invade East Francia. During their raids in the Carpathian Basin, the Magyars had several opportunities to collect information on their future homeland.

The Samanid emir, Isma&#x27;il ibn Ahmad, launched an expedition against the Oghuz Turks in 893, forcing them to invade the Pechenegs&#x27; lands between the Volga and Ural rivers. After being expelled from their homeland, the Pechenegs departed for the west in search of new pastures. The Magyars had in the meantime invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise. Simeon I of Bulgaria sent envoys to the Pechenegs and persuaded them to storm into Etelköz. The unexpected invasion destroyed the unguarded dwelling places of the Magyars, forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and seek refuge over the Carpathian Mountains. The Magyars occupied their new homeland in several phases, initially settling the lands east of the Danube and only invading the March of Pannonia after Arnulf of East Francia died in 899. They destroyed Moravia before 906 and consolidated their control of the Carpathian Basin through their victory over a Bavarian army in the Battle of Brezalauspurc in 907.

=== Archaeology ===

Since the 1830s, archaeology has played an important role in the study of the Magyar prehistory. Archaeologists have applied two methods; the so-called &quot;linear method&quot; attempts to determine the route of the migrating Magyars from their original homeland to the Carpathian Basin, while the &quot;retrospective method&quot; tries to discover the antecedents of 10th-century assemblages from the Carpathian Basin in the Eurasian steppes. However, only twelve cemeteries in the steppes have yielded finds that show similarities to assemblages unearthed in the Carpathian Basin. The dating of those cemeteries is also controversial.

Both the scarcity of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites may have contributed to the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians&#x27; migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.
Buckles, belt mounts, and other objects of the so-called &quot;Subotcy horizon&quot;, which were unearthed at Caterinovca, Slobozia, and other sites along the middle course of the Dniester show similarities with archaeological finds from the 10th-century Carpathian Basin. These objects were carbon dated to the late . The same archaeological sites also yielded vessels similar to the pottery of the neighboring Slavic territories.

=== Linguistics ===

The study of the Hungarian language is one of the main sources of the research on the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms. According to a scholarly theory, the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged. The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples. Loan words also reflect changes in the way of life of the Magyars.

=== Written sources ===
Written sources on the prehistoric Hungarians may begin with Herodotus, who wrote of the Iyrcae, a people of equestrian hunters who lived next to the Thyssagetae. Based on the location of the homeland of the Iyrcae and their ethnonym, Gyula Moravcsik, János Harmatta, and other scholars identify them as Hungarians; their view has not been universally accepted. The 6th-century Byzantine historian John Malalas referred to a Hunnic tribal leader called Muageris, who ruled around . Moravcsik, Dezső Pais, and other historians connect Muageris&#x27;s name to the Hungarians&#x27; endonym (Magyar); they say Malalas&#x27;s report proves the presence of Magyar tribes in the region of the Sea of Azov in the early . This identification is accepted by most scholars.

&quot;The Continuation of the Chronicle&quot; by George the Monk, which was written in the middle of the , recorded the first historical event – an alliance between the Magyars and the Bulgarians in the late 830s – that can without doubt be connected to the Magyars. The Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise&#x27;s &quot;Tactics&quot;, a book written around 904, contained a detailed description of their military strategies and way of life. Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus&#x27;s &quot;De administrando imperio&quot; (&quot;On Governing the Empire&quot;), which was completed between 948 and 952, preserves most information on the Magyars&#x27; early history. Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani, the minister of Nasr II, ruler of the Samanid Empire, collected the reports of merchants who had traveled in the western regions of the Eurasian steppes in the 870s and 880s. Although Al-Jayhani&#x27;s work was lost, later Muslim scholars Ibn Rusta, Gardizi, Abu Tahir Marwazi, and Al-Bakri used his book, preserving important facts about the late 9th-century Magyars. However, their works also contain interpolations from later periods. Among the sources written in Western Europe, the longer version of the &quot;Annals of Salzburg&quot;, Regino of Prüm&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;, the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, and Liutprand of Cremona&#x27;s &quot;Antapodosis&quot; (&quot;Retribution&quot;), provide contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous information of the 9th-century Magyars. There are also references to the Magyars dwelling in the Pontic steppes in the legends of Cyril, Methodius and other early Slavic saints. According to historian András Róna-Tas, information preserved in the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;, which was completed in the 1110s, has to be &quot;treated with extreme caution&quot;.

The first Hungarian chronicles were written in the late 11th or early but their texts were preserved in manuscripts compiled in the 13th to 15th centuries. Most extant chronicles show that the earliest works contained no information on the history of the Hungarians before their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century. The only exception is the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle, whose principal subject is the Magyars&#x27; pagan past. However, the reliability of this work, which was written by a former royal notary now known as Anonymus, is suspect. In his monograph of medieval Hungarian historians, Carlile Aylmer Macartney describes it as &quot;the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts&quot;.

== Historiography ==

=== Medieval theories ===

According to the &quot;Annals of St. Bertin&quot;, the Magyars who invaded East Francia in 862 were enemies &quot;hitherto unknown&quot; to the local population. Likewise, Regino of Prüm wrote that the Magyars had been &quot;unheard of in the previous centuries because they were not named&quot;. in the sources. Both remarks evince that late 9th-century authors had no knowledge of the Magyars&#x27; origins. However, the Magyar raids reminded the Western European and Byzantine scholars of earlier historians&#x27; descriptions of the Scythians or Huns, which gave rise to their identification with those peoples. For instance, Leo the Wise listed the Hungarians among the &quot;Scythian nations&quot;. The similarity between the Latin ethnonyms &quot;Huni&quot; and &quot;Hungari&quot; strengthened the identification of the two peoples, which became commonplace in Western Europe in the 11th century. The &quot;Chronicon Eberspergense&quot; was the first source that clearly stated that the Huns and the Hungarians were the same people.

The earliest Hungarian chronicles adopted the idea that the Huns and Hungarians were closely related. Anonymus did not mention the Huns, but he referred to Attila the Hun as a ruler &quot;from whose line Prince Álmos&quot;, the supreme head of the Magyar tribes, descended. However, Simon of Kéza explicitly identified the Huns and the Hungarians in the 1280. He started his chronicle with a book of the history of the Huns, thus presenting the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin as the reoccupation of a land inherited from their ancestors. Thereafter the identification of the two peoples was the basic theory of the origins of the Hungarians for centuries.

==== Legend of the Wondrous Hind ====
Most historians agree that the legend of the wondrous hind preserved the Hungarians&#x27; own myth of their origins. The late 13th-century chronicler Simon of Kéza was the first to record it. The legend says two brothers, Hunor and Magor, were the forefathers of the Huns and Hungarians. They were the sons of Ménrót and his wife, Eneth. While chasing a hind, they reached as far as the marches of the Sea of Azov, where they abducted the wives of Belar&#x27;s sons and two daughters of Dula, the prince of the Alans. According to historian Gyula Kristó, Eneth&#x27;s name derived from the Hungarian word for hind &quot;(ünő)&quot;, showing that the Magyars regarded this animal as their totemistic ancestor. Kristó also says the four personal names mentioned in the legend personify four peoples: the Hungarians (Magor), the Onogurs (Hunor), the Bulgars (Belar) and the Dulakindred of the Alans or Bulgars (Dulo). The hunt for a beast, ending with the arrival in a new homeland, was a popular legend among the peoples of the Eurasian steppes, including the Huns and the Mansi. The myth that a people were descended from two brothers was also widespread. Consequently, it is possible that Simon of Kéza did not record a genuine Hungarian legend, but borrowed it from foreign sources.

=== Modern scholarship ===

Scholarly attempts in the early 18th century to prove a relationship between the Finns and the Huns led to the realization of the similarities between the Finnish and Hungarian languages. János Sajnovics&#x27;s &quot;Demonstratio&quot;, the first systematic comparative study of Hungarian and the Saami languages, was published in 1770. Three decades later, Sámuel Gyarmathi demonstrated similarities between a larger group of languages that are now known as Uralic languages. However, the majority of Hungarian scholars only gradually adopted Sajnovics&#x27;s and Gyarmathi&#x27;s views. In the 1830s, Pál Hunfalvy still wrote that Hungarian had an intermediate position between the Finnish and Turkic languages, but later accepted that Hungarian is closely related to the Mansi and Khanty languages. Hereafter linguistics played a pre-eminent role in the research of the Magyars&#x27; prehistory because it was always the dominant linguistic theory that determined the interpretation of historical and archaeological evidence. Consequently, as historian Nóra Berend writes, Hungarian prehistory is &quot;a tenuous construct based on linguistics, folklore analogies, archaeology, and later written evidence&quot;, because there are no certain records of the Magyars before the and the identification of archaeological cultures with peoples is highly debatable. Historian László Kontler identifies &quot;the history of Hungarian origins&quot; as &quot;the history of a community whose genetic composition and cultural character has been changing, but which has assuredly spoken Hungarian or its predecessor language&quot;.

According to mainstream scholarly consensus, the Hungarians are not the autochthonous population of the Carpathian Basin. Their ancestors arrived there through a series of westward migrations across the Eurasian steppes around 894, centuries after their departure from their original homeland located somewhere in the East. Many details of the Magyars&#x27; prehistorythe location of their original homeland, the ancient Magyars&#x27; connections with the Turkic peoples and the Khazar Khaganate, their lifestyle and political organization, and the background of their conquest of the Carpathian Basinare still subject to scholarly debates. With regard to the connections between the Magyars and the Turkic tribes, archaeologist Gyula László mooted an alternative theory in the 1960s. According to his theory of the &quot;double conquest&quot;, a large group of people who spoke a Finno-Ugrian language arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 670, and a Turkic-speaking people conquered the same territory in the late 9th century. László&#x27;s theory has never been widely accepted.

== Way of life ==

=== Economy ===

Most Neolithic settlements were situated on the banks of rivers and lakes in the proposed original homeland of the Uralic peoples, but no houses have been excavated there. The local inhabitants primarily used tools made of stoneespecially jasper from the southern Urals, bone and wood, but baked clay vessels decorated with broken or wavy lines were also found. Their economy was based on fishing, hunting, and gathering. The basic Hungarian words connected to these activities&quot;háló&quot; (net), &quot;íj&quot; (bow), &quot;nyíl&quot; (arrow), &quot;ideg&quot; (bowstring), and &quot;mony&quot; (egg)are inherited from the Proto-Uralic period. The Hungarian words for house &quot;(ház)&quot;, dwelling &quot;(lak)&quot;, door &quot;(ajtó)&quot;, and bed &quot;(ágy)&quot; are of Proto-Finno-Ugric origin. Houses built in the presumed Finno-Ugric homeland in the wider region of the Urals in the show regional differences; in the valley of the Sosva River, square pit-houses were dug deep into the ground; along the Kama River, rectangular semi-pit houses were built. The local people were hunter-gatherers. They used egg-shaped, baked clay vessels that were decorated with rhombuses, triangles, and other geometrical forms. They buried their dead in shallow graves and showered the bodies with red ochre. They also placed objects including tools, jewels made of pierced boar tusks, and small pendants in the form of animal heads into the graves. Copper objects found in the graves, which were manufactured in the Caucasus Mountains, indicate that the inhabitants of the lands on both sides of the Ural Mountains had trading contacts with faraway territories around . Words from the Proto-Ugric period&quot;ló&quot; (&quot;horse&quot;), &quot;nyereg&quot; (&quot;saddle&quot;), &quot;fék&quot; (&quot;bridle&quot;), and &quot;szekér&quot; (&quot;wagon&quot;)show that those who spoke this language rode horses. Animal husbandry spread on both sides of the Urals from around . The bones of domestic animalscattle, goats, sheep, pigs, and horsescomprised 90% of all animal bones excavated in many settlements. Loan words from Proto-Iranian suggest the Ugric-speaking populations adopted animal husbandry from neighboring peoples. For instance, the Hungarian words for cow &quot;(tehén)&quot; and milk &quot;(tej)&quot; are of Proto-Iranian origin. Archaeological findsincluding seeds of millet, wheat, and barley, and tools including sickles, hoes, and spade handlesprove the local population also cultivated arable lands.

The Magyars&#x27; ancestors gave up their settled way of life because of the northward expansion of the steppes during the last centuries of the . Ethnographic studies of modern nomadic populations suggest cyclic migrationsa year-by-year movement between their winter and summer campsfeatured in their way of life, but they also cultivated arable lands around their winter camps. Most historians agree the Magyars had a mixed nomadic or semi-nomadic economy, characterized by both the raising of cattle and the cultivation of arable lands. Turkic loanwords in the Hungarian language show the Magyars adopted many practices of animal husbandry and agriculture from Turkic peoples between the . For instance, the Hungarian words for hen (tyúk), pig &quot;(disznó)&quot;, castrated hog &quot;(ártány)&quot;, bull (&quot;bika&quot;), ox &quot;(ökör)&quot;, calf (&quot;borjú&quot;), steer (&quot;tinó),&quot; female cow &quot;(ünő), goat (kecske),&quot; camel (&quot;teve&quot;), ram (&quot;kos&quot;), buttermilk (író), shepherd&#x27;s cloak (&quot;köpönyeg&quot;), badger (&quot;borz&quot;), fruit (&quot;gyümölcs&quot;), apple (&quot;alma&quot;), pear (&quot;körte&quot;), grape (&quot;szőlő&quot;), dogwood (&quot;som&quot;), sloe (&quot;kökény),&quot; wheat (&quot;búza&quot;), barley &quot;(árpa)&quot;, pea (&quot;borsó),&quot; hemp &quot;(kender),&quot; pepper (&quot;borz&quot;), nettle (&quot;csalán),&quot; garden &quot;(kert)&quot;, plough &quot;(eke)&quot;, ax (&quot;balta&quot;), scutcher (&quot;tiló&quot;), oakum (&quot;csepű),&quot; weed &quot;(gyom)&quot;, refuse of grain &quot;(ocsú)&quot;, fallow land &quot;(tarló)&quot;, and sickle &quot;(sarló)&quot; are of Turkic origin. Most loanwords were borrowed from Bulgar or other Chuvash-type Turkic language, but the place and the time of the borrowings are uncertain. The Magyars&#x27; connections with the people of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture may have contributed to the development of their agriculture, according to Spinei.

According to Ibn Rusta, the late 9th-century Magyars &quot;dwell in tents and move from place to place in search of pasturage&quot;, but during the winters they settled along the nearest river, where they lived by fishing. He also said their &quot;land is well watered and harvests abundant&quot;, showing they had arable lands, although it is unclear whether those lands were cultivated by the Magyars themselves or by their prisoners. Taxes collected from the neighboring peoples, a slave trade, and plundering raids made the Magyars a wealthy people. Gardezi wrote that they were &quot;a handsome people and of good appearance and their clothes are of silk brocade and their weapons are of silver and are encrusted with pearls&quot;, proving their growing wealth. However, 9th-century Byzantine and Muslim coins have rarely been found in the Pontic steppes.

Archaeological finds from the Carpathian Basin provide evidence of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors&#x27; graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence the high levels of skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.

A man seeking a bride was expected to pay a bride price to her father before the marriage took place, according to Gardizi&#x27;s description of the late 9th-century Magyars. The Hungarian word for bridegroom&quot;vőlegény&quot; from &quot;vevő legény&quot; (&quot;purchasing lad&quot;) and the expression &quot;eladó lány&quot; (verbatim, &quot;bride for sale&quot;) confirm the reliability of the Muslim author&#x27;s report. A decree of Stephen I of Hungary prohibiting the abduction of a girl without her parents&#x27; consent implies that pretended abduction of the bride by her future husband was an integral part of ancient Magyar matrimonial ceremonies.

=== Military ===

The Magyars&#x27; military tactics were similar to those of the Huns, Avars, Pechenegs, Mongols, and other nomadic peoples. According to Emperor Leo the Wise, the main components of Magyar warfare were long-distance arrow-fire, surprise attack, and feigned retreat. However, the contemporaneous Regino of Prüm said the Magyars knew &quot;nothing taking besieged cities&quot;. Archaeological research confirms Leo the Wise&#x27;s report of the use of sabres, bows, and arrows. However, in contrast with the emperor&#x27;s report, spears have rarely been found in Magyar warriors&#x27; tombs. Their most important weapons were bone-reinforced reflex bows, with which they could shoot at a specific target within .

=== Religion ===
Modern scholarly theories of the Magyars&#x27; pagan religious beliefs and practices are primarily based on reports by biased medieval authors and prohibitions enacted during the reigns of Christian kings. Both Christian and Muslim sources say the Magyars worshipped forces of nature. They gave offering to trees, fountains, and stones, and made sacrifices at wells; these are evidenced by the prohibition of such practices during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary in the late . In accordance with the custom of the peoples of the Eurasian steppes, the pagan Magyars swore oaths on dogs, which were bisected to warn potential oathbrakers of their fate. Simon of Kéza also wrote about the sacrifice of horses. According to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, the seven Magyar chiefs confirmed their treaty &quot;in pagan manner with their own blood spilled in a single vessel&quot;.

Scholars studying the Magyars&#x27; religion also take into account ethnographic analogies, folklore, linguistic evidence, and archaeological research. Artifacts depicting a bird of prey or a tree of life imply both symbols were important elements of the Magyar religion. Trepanationthe real or symbolic wounding of the craniumwas widely practiced by 10th-century Magyars. Gyula László writes that real trepanationsthe opening of the skull with a chiesel and the closing of the wound with a sheet of silverwere actually surgical operations similarly to those already practiced by Arab physicians, whereas symbolic trepanationsthe marking of the skull with an incised circlewere aimed at the disposal of a protective talisman on the head. According to Róna-Tas, a Hungarian word for cunning, &quot;(agyafúrt)&quot;verbatim &quot;with a drilled brain&quot;may reflect these ancient practices.

The Magyars buried their dead, laying the deceased on their backs with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior&#x27;s tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master&#x27;s grave, but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse&#x27;s skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth.

Scholarly theories note the similarities between the &quot;táltos&quot; of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including &quot;boszorkány&quot; (&quot;witch&quot;), &quot;elbűvöl&quot; (&quot;to charm&quot;), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (&quot;igy&quot; or &quot;egy&quot;), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: &quot;búcsú&quot; (indulgence), &quot;bűn&quot; (sin), &quot;gyón&quot; (confess), &quot;isten&quot; (god), and &quot;ördög&quot; (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children&#x27;s verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children&#x27;s verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where everything is upside-down.

<text>John Thomas Irwin (April 24, 1940 – December 20, 2019) was an American poet and literary critic. He was the Decker Professor in the Humanities and Professor in The Writing Seminars and the English Department at Johns Hopkins University.

==Background==
Irwin was born in Houston, Texas, and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. Following a stint in the US Navy, he received his Master&#x27;s degree and PhD in English from Rice University. He began his teaching career as an assistant professor in the English department at Johns Hopkins University in 1970, but left Johns Hopkins in 1974 to become the editor of &quot;The Georgia Review&quot; at the University of Georgia. Dr. Irwin returned to Johns Hopkins to become professor and chair of The Writing Seminars department. After that, he accepted a joint appointment in the English department and received an endowed chair, the Decker Professorship in the Humanities, in 1984.

==Publications==
Irwin&#x27;s first book of literary criticism, &quot;Doubling and Incest/Repetition and Revenge: A Speculative Reading of Faulkner&quot;, was published by the Johns Hopkins University Press in 1975. This was followed by his first book of poems, &quot;The Heisenberg Variations&quot;, under his pen name John Bricuth, published by the University of Georgia Press in 1976.

In 1980 he published his second book of literary criticism and scholarship, &quot;American Hieroglyphics: The Symbol of the Egyptian Hieroglyphics in the American Renaissance&quot;, with the Yale University Press, and in 1994 he published his third book of criticism, &quot;Mystery to a Solution: Poe, Borges. and the Analytical Detective Story&quot;, with the Johns Hopkins University Press. The latter book won the Christian Gauss Prize from Phi Beta Kappa for the best scholarly book in the humanities published in 1994 and also won the Aldo Scaglione Prize in comparative literature from the Modern Language Association for the best scholarly book published in the field of comparative literature that year.

His latest book, a narrative poem published by Johns Hopkins University press in 2005, is titled, &quot;As Long As It&#x27;s Big&quot;.

== Chess ==
Irwin was a noted chess aficionado, with a &quot;prodigious memory for chess.&quot; The US national senior chess championship is named in his honor.

<text>Topo, also known as Nossa Senhora do Rosário, is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) on the northeastern corner of the municipality Calheta on the island of São Jorge. It is considered the first settlement on the island of São Jorge to attain the status of municipality; from 1510 to 1867 &quot;Vila do Topo&quot; was the municipal seat of Topo, which included the neighboring parish of Santo Antão. The population in 2011 was 508, in an area of 9.24 km2.

==History==
Debate still exists on whether Topo was the first settlement on the island; the first colony was founded between 1480 and 1490, when a colony of Flemish people, under the direction of Willem van der Haegen, settled on the eastern coast. This adventurous Fleming, who later adopted the name &quot;Guilherme da Silveira&quot;, and whose descendants populate the numerous villages of São Jorge, was later buried in the chapel-annex of the &quot;Solar dos Tiagos&quot;. Due to its proximity to Terceira, and owing to the difficult overland links to Calheta (over the Serra do Topo), the village was always more closely tied to Angra do Heroísmo: inter-marriage existed between both communities and the residents of Angra saw Topo as an extension of the city of Angra. This proximity is visible in similar architectural styles, which are different from the other communities of São Jorge.

Until the middle of the 20th century, port of Topo was a referential point in the maritime connection with Terceira due to its location. Although this coast was punctuated by steep cliffs, a staircase to the &quot;Cais velho&quot; and successive remodelling (between 1560 and 1637) allowed access to the village by sea. The port, and its access to Terceira, was so important that after the villages annexation by Calheta, the construction of the first lighthouse was deliberated in favour of Topo.

Due to its population growth, the community was elevated to the status of village on September 12, 1510, transforming itself into one of the Captaincies of the island. Unfortunately, its further growth was curtailed by its limited hinterland, which would not allow further expansion economically. In fact, the village of Topo, until the middle of the 20th century did not have an adequate overland link to the rest of the island, and relied on its port. In the October 24, 1855 rationalization of the administrative divisions of the Azores, the municipality of Topo was disincorporated and merged into the administration of the municipality of Calheta (on April 1, 1870)

Although its title of &quot;village&quot; was removed, the community retained is urban distinction, with many community roadways and architecturally distinct buildings absent in the rest of the archipelago. For this reason, the community still took on the veneer of a &quot;village&quot;, whose loss was never really accepted by the population. Realizing these circumstances, a decree of the Regional Legislature (n.º 29/2003/A) devolved and re-established the village&#x27;s classification as village on June 24, 2003, making Topo the official third village on the island.

The village has been devastated by the locally-known Mandado de Deus (&quot;Sent by God&quot;) earthquake, which occurred on July 9, 1757, as well as the more recent January 1, 1980 earthquake, causing the destruction and instability of many homes. The primitive church, dating back to the 16th century, was destroyed during the event. It was reconstructed under the guidance of Father Matias Pereira de Sousa, and directed by José de Avelar de Melo, concluding in 1761: in two mass graves around the church, 84 victims of the &quot;Mandado de Deus&quot; were buried.

During the whaling era, in the middle of the 19th century, the port of Topo was the first on the island to support and replenish whalers; the first company was founded in 1885. The boats were guarded in dug-out caves along the southern cliffs.

Topo was also destroyed in 1980, during an earthquake that caused the forced emigration of many of its residence, and responsible for the death of 11 and the disappearance of 9 others. The movement of several tonnes of rock and debris in the north, forced the abandonment of many lands in the northern coast.

From a population of 2000 inhabitants the local community fell to 500 residents in a process of rapid depopulation that has not concluded. The decision, in 1997, to transform the old Franciscan Convent of São Diogo into a primary school. With this change the village has been able to stabilize the current population, and attract new functions, including: a Sports Pavilion, cantina, laboratories and public library. Similarly, by 1970 many yachts and sail boats used Topo as a stopover on trans-Atlantic and inter-island voyages.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
The village of Topo is located in the extreme southeast of the island of São Jorge, on a relatively planar terrain with a gentle slope that begins at Ponta do Topo and extends to the parish of Santo Antão, separated from the rest of the island by rugged Serra do Topo. In addition to Cume dos Arrebentões, Topo is the location of several volcanic peaks formed during the geological timeline, including The fertile plain in this area is known for the cultivation of wheat: the unique area in the Azores to still produce the crop annually. 
The Serra do Arrebentão, its various peaks (such as Pico do Facho, Pico das Rocas, Pico dos Frades and Pico da Pedra Vermelha), the northern coastal cliffs and the Grota das Pedras Brancas river-valley has made sea access historically more important than overland trails. Its privileged access to Terceira was an important part of Topo&#x27;s development, permitting commercial prosperity and cultivating familial links with Terceira, reflected in similar language patterns, architectural styles and ancestral relations between the islands.

====Ecoregions/Protected areas====
* Volcanic Complex of Topo - a volcanic region that encompasses the southern third of and includes a scenery of various shield and spatter cones;
* Topo Belvedere/Lookout - constructed in 2005, this lookout offers an extended vista from the Complex of Topo to the island of Terceira, and the village of Topo;
* Canada do Pessegueiro Belvedere/Lookout - located near the Vale das Éguas, it is a lookout that offers a vista of the zone of Calheta as well as the São Jorge-Pico Canal until the island of Pico;
* Pico do Facho - 854m altitude peak, located near Ribeira dos Vimes and Fajã dos Vimes between Pico dos Frades and Pico dos Cabecinhos, forming a plume of lava and pyroclastic debris along the southern coast;
* Pico dos Cabecinhos - 728m altitude peak located near Pico do Facho, Fajã do Salto Verde, Fajã do Nortezinho, Fajã do Norte Estreito and near the Fajã da Ribeira Funda, that forms a plume of lava and pyroclastic debris along the southern coast.

<text>Antonio Porchia (November 13, 1885 – November 9, 1968) was an Argentine poet. 

Porchia was born in Conflenti, Italy, but, after the death of his father in 1900, moved to Argentina. 

Porchia wrote a Spanish book entitled &quot;Voces&quot; (&quot;Voices&quot;), a book of aphorisms. It has since been translated into Italian and into English (by W.S. Merwin, Copper Canyon Press, 2003), French, and German. 

A very influential, yet extremely succinct writer, Porchia has been a cult author for a number of renowned figures of contemporary literature and thought such as André Breton, Jorge Luis Borges, Don Paterson, Roberto Juarroz and Henry Miller, amongst others. Some critics have paralleled his work to Japanese haiku and found many similarities with a number of Zen schools of thought.

<doc id="1143035" wikidata="Q918832" url="?curid=1143035" title="Vagn Holmboe">
<text>Vagn Gylding Holmboe (, 20 December 1909 – 1 September 1996) was a Danish composer and teacher.

==Life==
Vagn Holmboe was born in Horsens, Jutland, into a merchant family of dedicated amateur musicians. Both parents played the piano. His father earned his living as a maker of colours and lacquers at Horsens. The Danish journalist Knud Holmboe was his elder brother.

From the age of 14 Vagn Holmboe took violin lessons. In 1926, at the age of 16, he began formal music training at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen on the recommendation of Carl Nielsen. He studied under Knud Jeppesen (theory) and Finn Høffding (composition).

After finishing his studies in 1929 he moved to Berlin where for a short period Ernst Toch became his teacher. During his time in the German capital he met the Romanian-born pianist and visual artist Meta May Graf (1910–2003) from Sibiu/Hermannstadt. She had studied at the Musikhochschule Berlin since 1929, with Paul Hindemith as one of her teachers. The couple married in 1933 and left Berlin for Romania, where they visited obscure and remote villages and studied Transylvanian folk-song. Subsequently, they moved to Denmark, settling in the capital, Copenhagen, in 1934. While his wife Meta gave up her musical career to pursue her passions in the visual arts, photography in particular, Vagn gave music lessons privately and began composing during this period. Many of the early compositions have never been performed. Similar to the research he had already done in Romania, he pursued his studies of folk-song with much field-work throughout Denmark including the Faroes and Greenland. Many overtly folk-linked compositions, including the Inuit Songs, are a result of these activities.

From 1941 to 1949 he was a teacher at the Royal Institute for the Blind, and from 1950 to 1965 he taught at the Royal Conservatory in Copenhagen, being appointed a Professor there in 1955. Prior to that, he had also worked as a music critic for the Danish daily &quot;Politiken&quot; from 1947 to 1955.

Vagn Holmboe&#x27;s students included Per Nørgård, Ib Nørholm, Bent Lorentzen, Arne Nordheim, Egil Hovland and Alan Stout. 

Vagn and his wife Meta had bought a piece of land at Lake Arresø in Ramløse/Zealand in 1940, where they set up a farm, &quot;Arre Boreale&quot; (Latin for &quot;Northern Arresø&quot;), in the 1950s and spent the rest of their lives together there. Vagn Holmboe was a keen nature-lover who lived in the countryside until his death in 1996 and over the years personally planted 3000 trees on his land.

==Music==
Holmboe composed about 370 works, including 13 symphonies, three chamber symphonies, four symphonies for strings, 20 string quartets, numerous concertos, one opera, and the late series of 10 &quot;Preludes&quot; for chamber orchestra, as well as much choral and other music, in addition to some early works that never received opus numbers. His last work, the 21st string quartet, &quot;Quartetto sereno,&quot; was completed by his pupil Per Nørgård.

Musical metamorphosis of thematic or motivic fragments characterize most of his works between the years 1950 and 1970; in this regard his music is similar to that written by Jean Sibelius earlier in the twentieth century. His earlier works show the influence of East European composers such as Béla Bartók; his work also shows the influence of Igor Stravinsky, Carl Nielsen and Dmitri Shostakovich.

His choral or brass music, or his wind Notturno from 1940 may be performed more often than his works for full or chamber orchestra.

Private tapes exist of performances of Holmboe&#x27;s music; these were made by Fritz Mahler, Nikolai Malko, among others.

<text>Chelmsley Wood, sometimes called just Chelmsley, is a town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, West Midlands, England, with a population of 12,453. It is located near Birmingham Airport and the National Exhibition Centre. It lies about eight miles east of Birmingham and 5 miles to the north of Solihull. The town is also close to both Coleshill and Water Orton in Warwickshire, the county the area was historically part of.

In 1966 Birmingham City Council compulsorily purchased the ancient woodland and built the 15,590 dwelling council estate to rehouse families on its council house waiting list. With the rise in unemployment in the 1970s parts of the estate suffered from deprivation and anti-social behaviour. The area established a town council.

Local government re-organisation in 1974 transferred the town to Solihull Metropolitan Borough, though responsibility for the housing remained with Birmingham until September 1980.

== History ==

Chelmsley Wood was built by Birmingham City Council in the late 1960s and early 70s on ancient woodland, once part of the Forest of Arden, as an overspill town for Birmingham. Permission for the construction of the overspill estate on green belt land was granted by Richard Crossman as Minister of Housing and Local Government. A shopping centre (which opened on 7 April 1970), a library (completed in 1970 at £240,000), hall and belatedly a few public houses. With the adjoining neighbourhoods of Fordbridge and Smith&#x27;s Wood it became part of Metropolitan Borough of Solihull in 1974.

By the end of the Second World War 12,391 homes had been destroyed by aerial bombing in Birmingham and there was to be no house building in the city for six years so the programme of slum clearance had been halted. By the 1950s there were terrific demand for homes. Large estates were built within the city boundaries such as Druid&#x27;s Heath, Castle Vale and at Bromford on the site of the city&#x27;s former racecourse, but by 1963 there was no further land available within the city boundaries.

The city council had powers under the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1900 to purchase land out-of- area. On 21 December 1964, Richard Crossman the new minister for housing sent a letter to Sir Frank Price, leader of Birmingham City Council proposing the scheme. The population was increasing and it was estimated that there would be a deficiency of 43,000 dwellings by 1971, which would have been worse than it had been in 1959. At a meeting of the House Building Committee in February 1965, it was decided to build a large new development to the east of the city. Objections were raised about the scheme, particularly from Meriden Rural District Council and the local Parish Councils in the nearby villages of Kingshurst and Hampton-in-Arden, on grounds of amenity and the threat to the green belt separating Birmingham and Coventry. A similar application for the use of nearly 300 acres at Wythall to the south of Birmingham was considered, but this was turned down. Permission was granted.

===&quot;The Wood&quot;===
Land was compulsorily purchased and construction of the 15,590 dwellings was begun in 1965 and completed in 1970. Although the area became part of Solihull in 1974, Birmingham City Council retained control of their houses until they were officially transferred to Solihull MBC on 29 September 1980. Construction started in 1965 and the first rates were levied on houses in Oak Croft on 6 March 1967. Such was the scale of the operation that a development company was to design finance and build a complete town centre which was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 April 1972.

The &quot;Wood&quot; was to be 80% public housing and 18% privately developed homes, houses were reserved for 100 policemen and rows of terraced homes were let out or sold at a reduced rate to key workers: nurses, social workers and teachers working on the estate. The &quot;Wood&quot; had considerable thought put into its planning and won architectural awards for its landscaping. It was provided with schools, a library and shopping areas, but in the early days there was no local pub, the nearest one being reached by a five-mile bus journey.The &quot;unity and harmony&quot; of the design made it appear monotonous rather than modern.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chelmsley&quot; is of considerable antiquity. It indicates a settlement of Saxon origin – the enclosure of Ceolmund. Ceolmund Crescent is the name of the road that passes by the police station, and the Post Office Tower in the town centre.
 The word &quot;Ceolmund&quot; itself comes from the Old English Ceol &quot;Keel&quot; (of a ship) and Mund &quot;Protection&quot;.

==Concept and Design==
There were the 15,590 dwellings (including 39 multi-storey blocks of flats). There were 70 shop units and 6 major stores, as well as a 4-storey office block and 2 pubs. The 221 dwellings in the town centre included 14 maisonettes over shops. It was laid out in a Radburn style with houses opening out onto pedestrian pathways and open green space, and backing onto the vehicular access. To enhance the openness, there were no fences between gardens and public space.

===Tower blocks===
With the 6 adjoining estates, which over half a century have merged, there were 51 tower blocks until the late 1990s, in the complex. As of 2015 there are approximately 42 tower blocks left across the estates.

==Transport==
National Express West Midlands operate a number of buses in and around the Chelmsley Wood area. Chelmsley Wood shopping centre has a bus interchange which hosts buses that go to and from Birmingham city centre, Solihull town centre, Coleshill, Warwickshire, Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham Airport. In Summer 2017, National Express West Midlands extensively rerouted and retimed all of their bus routes that run to/from Chelmsley Wood.

The closest railway station is at Marston Green which is about a mile (1.75 km) from Chelmsley Wood Shopping Centre. From there, there are trains to Coventry, Birmingham Airport, Birmingham City Centre and The National Exhibition Centre.

==Leisure==
North Solihull Sports Centre is the largest and most used sports centre in Chelmsley Wood and its surrounding areas. It hosts two swimming pools, a sports hall, a fitness suite, studio, crèche and café bar. It also hosts an outdoor running track, and an astroturf pitch.

===Sports teams===
Chelmsley Wood is represented in association football by Chelmsley Town, who currently compete in the and play at Pack Meadow in nearby Coleshill.

== Recent development ==
The town had for decades had a negative reputation due to being associated with anti-social behaviour and crime, although the town has been relatively successful compared to other similar estates across England.

The town is currently undergoing the biggest redevelopment project in its history.

== Demographics ==
Politically, Chelmsley Wood is represented by three councillors on Solihull Council. Voters had historically been known for their strong support of Labour candidates at both local and national elections. However, in the 2006 election, the Chelmsley Wood ward elected a candidate from the British National Party, the first in Solihull&#x27;s history. The elected candidate won by a margin of 19 votes. In the 2010 election the seat went back to Labour after George Morgan stood down with the BNP vote falling dramatically and the Green Party finishing second to Labour by 22 votes.

Since 2011, Chelmsley Wood residents have elected Green Party councillors to serve them at every election, voting in Karl Macnaughton (2011), Chris Williams (2012) and James Burn (2014). Karl Macnaughton was re-elected in the 2015 elections with over 68% of the vote, and Chris Williams in 2016 with 75%.

<text>Nossa Senhora do Rosário is a civil parish and most populated area in the municipality of Lagoa, on the island of São Miguel, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. With a population of 5396 inhabitants in 2011, the parish covers an area of approximately that extends from the southern coast of the island. It contains the localities Atalhada, Bairro das Socas, Nossa Senhora do Rosário, Porto dos Carneiros and Vila Mar.

==History==

Rosário was originally part of the neighboring parish of Santa Cruz, but quickly its population and socio-political importance grew, requiring an administrative solution. Local historians suggest that may have been one of the first villas to be settled on the island of São Miguel, although there is little record to support this assertion. The settlement was elevated to the status of &quot;vila&quot; on 22 April 1522, under the religious parish of Santa Cruz; half a decade later, the continued growth of the settlement necessitated the establishment of a secondary faith community concentrated on the parochial church of Nossa Senhora do Rosário, thus justifying its creation on 5 April 1595.

In his public work Memorial da Lagoa e do seu Concelho (&quot;Memory of Lagoa and its Municipality&quot;), Carreiro da Costa wrote: 
:&quot;There is a decree that is known by the studious, and it is a valuable document about the beginning of settlement in our islands. It is a decree during the age of minority of that monarch (Afonso V), dated 2 od July 1439, where the Infante D. Henrique is authorized to send to the first seven islands of the Azores, at the time discovered, the first families, when years before there were scattered some head of cattle.&quot; It was this note, that the coastal areas of São Miguel that justified the assertion that the area in which the present villa is located pertained to the first settlers in the Azores. These first settlers encountered prodigious herds of sheep and goats, and in particular rams when they arrived in the bay of Lagoa. Consequently, the cove was named &quot;Porto dos Carneiros&quot; (&quot;carneiros&quot; meaning &quot;rams&quot; in Portuguese).

In the middle of the 15th Century, there existed in this settlement four religious temples, one of which was the Church of Nossa Senhora do Rosário. This church was expanded progressively, as the community grew, and between 1583-1586, it began to serve as the villas central church, while the Church of Santa Cruz was being remodeled. Nossa Senhora do Rosário was constructed over an older chapel of the same name that had existed since the 16th Century. The 17th Century church, in larger dimensions, has three naves and notable group of sculptures by the artist Machado de Castro.

The municipal council of Lagoa promoted a ceremony to honour the diverse personalities from the parish to mark the 417 anniversary of the elevation of the community to civil parish status.

==Geography==
The parish is situated along the southern maritime coast, between Santa Cruz and Ponta Delgada, and extends along coast and into the interior. Two main vias intersect the parish and divide the parish into quarters, along north-south and west-east segments of the regional E.R.1-1ª roadway. To the south is the older arm of the coastal road that connects the city to Ponta Delgada and Vila Franca do Campo.

The border follows the Grota do Porto ravine, north to the border with Cabouco (along &quot;Rua das Arrudas&quot;), then west to the beginning of &quot;Caminho do Malaca&quot;, following this road to Malacca de Cima. Crossing the Via-Rápida (North-South), the frontier follows the &quot;Estrada dos Portões Vermelhos&quot; until the E.R.7 roadway, when it descends along &quot;Canada das Socas&quot;, then &quot;Canada Santa&quot; to the Barrio of Socas and the west-east segment of the Via-Rápida. From this freeway the border follows the &quot;Canada Nova do Pópulo&quot;, then &quot;Rua Padre Domingos da Silva Costa&quot;, before bisecting towards the coast through the property of Prolacto-Nestlé factory.

To the west, alongside the Via-Rapida, is the industrial zone of the city of Lagoa, to the north the main modern residential community, while to the interior are landscapes of walled agricultural lands and forest woodlots.

==Economy==

Rosário is an industrial center in the region, the location of several large and artisanal businesses that produce oils, animal feed, soap, services that include carpentry, metallurgy, saw mills, as well as the sale of alcohol, ceramics, paints.

Further, the agricultural production of milk and milk products (specifically cheese and butter), commercial fishery and hotel service sectors are also important in the area.

There are two industrial zones: at the intersection of Via-Rapida off-ramps it the Technological Park of Lagoa () and to the north, the Industrial Park of Portões Vermelhos (&quot;Parque Industrial dos Portões Vermelhos&quot;).

<text>Clareification is the student newsletter of Clare College, a college of the University of Cambridge. It is produced termly by editor(s) elected each year by the student body.

In 2005, it won the &#x27;Best College Paper&#x27; award in &quot;The Cambridge Student&quot;.

== Controversy ==

In 2007, in a guest-edited edition devoted to religious satire, entitled &quot;Crucification&quot;, the magazine re-printed one of the Danish Muhammad cartoons which provoked an international incident when they were originally published 15 months earlier.

The guest editor was taken into hiding due to the threat of violent reprisals. The college&#x27;s former senior tutor, Patricia Fara, issued a statement saying, &quot;The college finds the publication and the views expressed abhorrent.&quot; The college called a Court of Discipline to judge the student and suspended the newsletter&#x27;s funding. The &quot;Cambridge Evening News&quot; described the issue as &quot;racist&quot;, in an article in which an &quot;insider&quot; suggested that the magazine might constitute &quot;racial incitement&quot;. Two students were subsequently interviewed under caution by police in connection with the issue.

Following the incident, the Union of Clare Students Executive independently published two further issues, predominantly devoted to satirising the coverage of the controversy. A new editor was elected the following academic year.

==Editors==
Past editors of &quot;Clareification&quot; include the comedian Matt Kirshen and the philosopher Jonathan Birch.

<text>The Seattle, Washington Seafair Pirates are a voluntary group of people started in 1949 by the members of the Washington State Press Club. They joined with other community leaders to create Seattle&#x27;s first Seafair Festival in 1950.

The Seafair Pirates was founded in 1949 by some of the younger members of the Ale &amp; Quail Society. The group was created to help provide some entertainment and to promote the Seafair festival in Seattle, Washington. The Seafair Pirates are a dedicated group who take their roles as pirates seriously. There is a rigorous process to even being considered when joining the group, as they only want individuals who will dedicate themselves. They are present at the Seafair parades during the summer months, and the boom of their cannons warn the crowd that they are coming.

==Charity ==

The group entertains and raise funds for different charities all year.

== Pirates and Seattle community events ==

The Seafair festival is a monthlong festival that starts with the Seafair Pirates Landing at Alki Beach in Seattle, usually during the first Saturday of July. Throughout the summer the Seafair Pirates participate in approximately 40 local festivals as well as several hundred private appearances. The grand finale is the Seattle Seafair Torchlight Parade that occurs in August. &quot;Seafair has become a home town jewel that reaches nearly 2 million Puget Sound residents each summer.&quot;

The Seafair Torchlight Parade is a regular highlight of the Seafair summer festival. In 1999, the parade featured 4,000 participants on more than 100 floats and in bands and dance and entertainment acts. This parade is ranked the largest nighttime parade in the Northwest, with drill teams, community floats, regional and international bands, equestrian units, giant helium balloons, clowns and pirates.

==The Pirates outside Seattle==
The Seafair Pirates are goodwill ambassadors for the city of Seattle, and have traveled across the United States and Canada, as well as to Grand Cayman, Mazatlán, Kobe, and Taiwan. They formerly travelled to the Cayman Islands for Pirate Week. In 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; was shooting its Swimsuit Issue for 2008 and the pirates appeared in full uniform with model Melissa Haro.

== History ==
In 1949 the younger members of the Washington State Press Club&#x27;s action committee, the Ale &amp; Quail Society, founded the Seattle Seafair Pirates. The members of the Society then joined with other community leaders to create Seattle&#x27;s first Seafair festival in 1950. Since that time the Seattle Seafair Pirates have directed their energies and talents toward the promotion and production of Seattle&#x27;s annual Seafair festivities.

Every summer since 1950 the Seafair festivities have begun with the annual proclamation of Davy Jones&#x27; renewed warfare upon the upstart, so-called &quot;King&quot; Neptune. In due course the city falls and the Mayor hands over the keys to the city at the Pirate&#x27;s Landing. The Seafair Pirates have triumphed again!

In early days the Seafair Pirates&#x27; triumph often included the burning of Neptune&#x27;s flagship, complete with fire-works. That stopped when the supply of derelict ships became depleted.

The Seafair Pirates are led by Captain Kidd and Davy Jones. Captain Kidd is elected by the Ale &amp; Quail Society to lead their pirate operations. Davy Jones, an honorary Seafair Pirate, is chosen from the Seattle community to sail with the Pirates for one year.

Always seeking to promote Seattle and Seafair, the Seafair Pirates have had many adventures over the years. According to the Pirates&#x27; website, in 1953 the Seafair Pirates heard of a fund that had been established to ransom British subjects captured by pirates. By then the fund was worth well over a million dollars. In an attempt to collect this treasure the Seafair Pirates &quot;kidnapped&quot; the British consul and vice-consul, informing the government of Britain that the pirates of old were still in business. While they were mentioned in &quot;The Times&quot; (of London), they did not receive any payment.

==Pirate ships==
The Seafair Pirates command two ships.

The Moby Duck is a former DUKW from World War II which has been highly modified to resemble an old Spanish galleon. The &quot;Moby Duck&quot; has a Federal Signal Q2B siren. The &quot;Moby Duck&quot; was formerly amphibious but now sails only on dry land.

In 2006, the pirates acquired a hydroplane, the U-37, better known as the Miss Seattle. The boat had a previous existence as the U-8 Llumar Window Film, and has won the 2005 Seafair Chevrolet Cup (and two other races outside Seattle) and also won the 2006 Seafair Chevrolet Cup. Jean Theoret will continue to pilot the boat in races. The boat&#x27;s official owner is Billy Schumacher, a boat racing celebrity.

<doc id="1143044" wikidata="Q45728" url="?curid=1143044" title="Open-hearth furnace">
<text>An open-hearth furnace or open hearth furnace is any of several kinds of industrial furnace in which excess carbon and other impurities are burnt out of pig iron to produce steel. Because steel is difficult to manufacture owing to its high melting point, normal fuels and furnaces were insufficient for mass production of steel, and the open-hearth type of furnace was one of several technologies developed in the nineteenth century to overcome this difficulty. Compared with the Bessemer process, which it displaced, its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), was easier to control, and permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap iron and steel.

The open-hearth furnace was first developed by British engineer Carl Wilhelm Siemens. In 1865, the European engineer Pierre-Émile Martin took out a licence from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. Their process was known as the Siemens–Martin process or Martin–Siemens process, and the furnace as an &quot;open-hearth&quot; furnace. Most open hearth furnaces were closed by the early 1990s, not least because of their slow operation, being replaced by the basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace.

Whereas the earliest example of open-hearth steelmaking is found about 2000 years ago in the culture of the Haya people, in present day Tanzania, and in Europe in the Catalan forge, invented in Spain in the 8th century, it is usual to confine the term to certain 19th-century and later steelmaking processes, thus excluding bloomeries (including the Catalan forge), finery forges, and puddling furnaces from its application.

==Open-hearth process==

The open-hearth process is a batch process and a batch is called a &quot;heat&quot;. The furnace is first inspected for possible damage. Once it is ready or repaired, it is charged with light scrap, such as sheet metal, shredded vehicles or waste metal. The furnace is heated using burning gas. Once the charge has melted, heavy scrap, such as building, construction or steel milling scrap is added, together with pig iron from blast furnaces. Once all the steel has melted, slag-forming agents such as limestone are added. Atmospheric oxygen in contact with molten pig iron directly oxidizes the carbon in excess it contains to form carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, Fe(II) present in iron(II) oxide (FeO) and other impurities also contribute to decarburize the pig iron by oxidizing carbon into CO and simultaneously reducing Fe(II) into metallic Fe. The formed carbon monoxide (CO) is flushed away in the fumes, while steel is formed. To increase the oxidizing power of the &quot;heat&quot;, more iron oxide ore can be added.
The process is far slower than that of the Bessemer converter and thus easier to control and sample for quality assessment. Preparing a heat usually takes eight to eight and a half hours, and longer to finish the conversion into steel. As the process is slow, it is not necessary to burn all the carbon away as in the Bessemer process, but the process can be terminated at any given point when the desired carbon content has been achieved.

The furnace is tapped in the same way a blast furnace is tapped; a hole is drilled in the side of the hearth and the raw steel flows out. Once all the steel has been tapped, the slag is skimmed away. The raw steel may be cast into ingots, a process called &quot;teeming&quot;, or it may be used in continuous casting in the rolling mill.

The regenerators are the distinctive feature of the furnace and consist of fire-brick flues filled with bricks set on edge and arranged in such a way as to have a great number of small passages between them. The bricks absorb most of the heat from the outgoing waste gases and return it later to the incoming cold gases for combustion.

==History==
Carl Wilhelm Siemens developed the Siemens regenerative furnace in the 1850s, and claimed in 1857 to be recovering enough heat to save 70–80% of the fuel. This furnace operates at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it for that.

In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-Émile Martin took out a license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. The most appealing characteristic of the Siemens regenerative furnace is the rapid production of large quantities of basic steel, used for example to construct high-rise buildings. The usual size of furnaces is 50 to 100 tons, but for some special processes they may have a capacity of 250 or even 500 tons.

The Siemens–Martin process complemented rather than replaced the Bessemer process. It is slower and thus easier to control, allowing production of better product. It also permits the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, further lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. One of its important drawbacks is that melting and refining a charge takes several hours. This was an advantage in the early 20th century, as it gave plant chemists time to analyze the steel and decide how much longer to refine it. But by about 1975 electronic instruments such as atomic absorption spectrophotometers had made analysis of the steel much easier and faster. The work environment around an open-hearth furnace is said to be extremely dangerous, although that may be even more true of the environment around a basic oxygen or electric arc furnace.

On the one hand, the process achieves lesser economies of scale than the Bessemer, so its steel was costlier in former&#x27;s heyday, but on the other, it was more suitable for countries which couldn&#x27;t produce lots of steel anyway due to limitations of natural resources. 

Russian engineers invented the twin-hearth furnace in the mid-20th century. It has two melting pools separated by a brick wall, and no regenerator chambers. Instead the furnace has direct burners and oxygen lances at the ceiling of the furnace. The idea is to process two heats simultaneously, but in different phases, e.g. when one is being charged, the other is being decarburized. The idea is to burn away excess carbon and impurities with oxygen blast instead of free flame formation. All reactions which occur are exothermic, so the burners have only an auxiliary role. This is similar as the AJAX furnace, which also uses oxygen blow instead of free flame formation and regenerator chambers.

Basic oxygen steelmaking eventually replaced the open-hearth furnace. It rapidly superseded both the Bessemer and Siemens–Martin processes in western Europe by the 1950s and in eastern Europe by the 1980s. Open-hearth steelmaking had superseded the Bessemer process in UK by 1900, but elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, the Bessemer and Thomas processes were used until the late 1960s when they were superseded by basic oxygen steelmaking. The last open-hearth furnace in former East Germany was stopped in 1993. In the US, steel production using the Bessemer process ended in 1968 and the open-hearth furnaces had stopped by 1992. In Hunedoara steel works, Romania the last 420-tonne capacity open-hearth furnace was shut down on 12 June 1999 and demolished and scrapped between 2001 and 2003, but the eight smokestacks of the furnaces remained until February 2011. The last open-hearth shop in China was shut down in 2001. The process in the form of Twin Hearth Furnace was in use in India&#x27;s Steel Authority of India Bhilai Steel Plant and some parts of Ukraine. Russia retired its last hearth furnace in March 2018, and was considering preserving it as a museum artifact. India&#x27;s SAIL shut it down in April 2020 with the advent of COVID19 because of nonavailability of manpower to run the labor intensive process.

As of 2024, the largest steel mill in the world that still produces steel using open-hearth furnaces is the Zaporizhstal steel mill in central Ukraine, which has seven 500-ton capacity OHFs and one twin-hearth furnace as well as four blast furnaces. The availability of cheap fuel oil in large quantities, as well as the ongoing invasion, largely contribute to their profitability despite the slow process. The high cost of upgrading to new furnace technologies is prohibitive.

<doc id="1143048" wikidata="Q757078" url="?curid=1143048" title="Calheta, Madeira">
<text>Calheta () is a municipality on the southwest coast of Madeira, Portugal. The population in 2011 was 11,521, in an area of 111.50 km2.

==History==

The origin of the areas name, are both related to the toponymy of &quot;Calheta&quot; (which means &quot;small bay&quot; in Portuguese, but &quot;cal&quot; also means &quot;lime&quot; and it relates to limestone): first, that there existed a small bay or cove, which already had this name, but secondly, that the area of the settlement was the off-port for sugar and collection of wood. Calheta was founded in 1430; the parish, of the same name (which is the central part of the municipality) is one of the oldest parishes on the island of Madeira, and one of the first to be explored by the early settlers. It was the area selected by João Gonçalves Zarco (the island&#x27;s discoverer) as a grant to his son and his wife, João Gonçalves da Câmara and Beatriz Gonçalves.

The village became a town 72 years after its foundation, on 1 July 1502, after a royal foral (charter) was granted by King Manuel I. The region was primarily settled by noblemen and knights, influencing the toponymic names that appeared in many of its localities: such as &quot;Lombo do Doutor&quot; and &quot;Lombo do Atouguia&quot;. In 1502, João de França constructed the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Graça (), which was to be the basis for the new parish of Calheta, founding the first and oldest institutions of the parish. Similarly, the Santa Casa da Misericórdia was established in 1535, to serve the elderly and provide healthcare for the local residents.

The parish of Prazeres, which was an ecclesiastical component of Estreito da Calheta was dismembered in 1733, becoming an autonomous clergy on 12 November (which was later followed by the first cornerstone of the Church of Prazeres, in 1751). The Liberal revolution resulted in the incorporation of Calheta as municipality in 1835. Similarly, the parish of Ponta do Pargo, after several years being part of the municipality of Porto Moniz (between 1835 and 1849), began to function as an administrative unit of the municipality of Calheta after the latter municipal seat was disincorporated. The restoration of Porto Moniz in 1855, resulted in the parishes reincorporation within the borders of Porto Moniz. By law, on 26 June 1871, was reintegrated into Ponta do Pargo.

Tristão Vaz Teixeira Bettencourt da Câmara, was granted the title of Baron of Jardim do Mar: his was a proprietor and later the director of the &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; in Funchal. In one of the last events of the monarchy of Portugal affecting Calheta, King Carlos I of Portugal and Queen Amélie of Orléans visited the village of Calheta, travelling to Rabaçal, during their trip to Madeira. On 5 June 1922, the lighthouse in Ponta da Vigia, Ponta do Pargo was inaugurated to protect the western coast of the island. The Bairro Piscatório do Paul do Mar (a block of homes destined for peoples involved in the fishery) were inaugurated in July 1944.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
Calheta is located west of Santana, Machico and Funchal, along the southern roadway.

Even from its position Saharan Desert sands are able to occasionally affect the area, producing minor dust clouds.

===Human geography===
For statistical and administrative reasons, it is referred to as Vila da Calheta to avoid confusion with other &quot;Calhetas&quot; in Portugal, such as Calheta in the Azores.

The municipality includes eight administrative parishes that handle local affairs, representing individual communities along the roadways of the municipality:
* Arco da Calheta
* Calheta
* Estreito da Calheta
* Fajã da Ovelha
* Jardim do Mar
* Paúl do Mar
* Ponta do Pargo
* Prazeres

Calheta, the parish, had a population of 3,163 (2011), within an administrative area of 23.45 km2.

==Economy==
Agriculture and the fishery provides the primary sources of income in this area, although minor commercial establishments are concentrated in the principal village in the municipality. Agriculture was the first industry to develop in this region; the production/cultivation of banana, wine, horticulture and sugar cane developed as the main export products. The fishery supported the populations of Paúl do Mar and the &quot;vila&quot; of Calheta, although fishermen existed throughout the municipality.

Industrial activity has changed throughout the region, and has developed through cycles, including the dairy industry, fireworks, salt, beekeeping and sugar cane refinement, which have all undergone peaks and troughs. Of these, for example, the factory/ironworks used for conversion of honey into &quot;aguardente&quot;, a distilled spirit common in the village of Calheta and the fireworks buildings in the Lombo do Doutor were integral businesses in the municipalities development.

==Education==
While the communities of Calheta do have two secondary schools (EBSC and EBSP), higher education facilities are located in Funchal. There are four main primary schools offering instruction for children: &quot;EB1 Ladeira e Lamaceiros&quot; and &quot;EB1 Lombo do Guiné&quot; (both in Arco da Calheta), &quot;EB1 Lombo do Atouguia&quot; and &quot;EB1 Calheta&quot;, &quot;EB1 Estreito da Calheta&quot;, as well as the kindergarten, &quot;JI Apresentação da Estrela&quot; run by catholic nuns (in Calheta). In the parish of Ponta do Pargo, Maria Amélia de Sousa, provided educational instruction, at the primary level, for many of the children of the western coast of Calheta, lasting 70 years. This formalized education was unique for including children of both sexes.

The municipal council has also been active in providing ancillary services to support the community, through the remodelling of many playgrounds (two of which include official football fields, in Prazeres and Paul do Mar) and a swimming pool by the EBSC.

== Notable people ==
* José Vicente de Freitas (1869 in Calheta – 1952), 2nd Baron of Freitas, a Portuguese military officer and politician.
* Vasco da Gama Rodrigues (1909 in Paul do Mar - 1991) a Portuguese poet.

<doc id="1143049" wikidata="Q499143" url="?curid=1143049" title="Preceptor">
<text>A preceptor (from Latin, &quot;praecepto&quot;) is a teacher responsible for upholding a &quot;precept&quot;, meaning a certain law or tradition.

==Buddhist monastic orders==
Senior Buddhist monks can become the preceptors for newly ordained monks. In the Buddhist monastic code of discipline, the Buddha instructed that one of the criteria to conduct the &quot;Higher Ordination&quot; Ceremony (Upasampadā) is that the candidate will need to have a preceptor to provide guidance on monastic discipline, consisting of 227 precepts. During the ordination, the candidate will request one of the senior monks to be his preceptor. When the senior monk agreed to do so, he will be the preceptor of the candidate and guide him as long as he remains a bhikkhu in the Buddha&#x27;s Dispensation (Buddha Sāsana). 

==Christian military orders==
A preceptor was historically in charge of a preceptory, the headquarters of an order of monastic knights, such as the Knights Hospitaller or the Knights Templar, within a given geographical area. The preceptor exercised supreme control over his brethren and was answerable only to the Grand Master of his order. A preceptory&#x27;s main focus was on its church and on accommodation for the brethren. Examples in the UK include the Hospitaller Torphichen Preceptory in West Lothian; West Peckham Preceptory in Kent; the Templar Aslackby Preceptory in Lincolnshire; Keele Preceptory in Staffordshire; and Temple, Midlothian.

==Freemasonry==
Within modern Freemasonry, the preceptor is the head of a lodge of instruction. Lodges of instruction operate within a geographical area and provide training in the performance of the order&#x27;s rituals. The preceptor, whose position is elective, is usually a Freemason who has spent several years as a director of ceremonies in his local lodge and is considered an expert in the rituals.

In English Freemasonry, the Preceptor of the lodge is usually appointed by the Master. His main responsibility is to prompt those masons who have forgotten their words. Some lodges, and some preceptors, take the role as teacher more seriously than others.

==Music==
In the world of music, the title of preceptor usually refers to a monk responsible for making music in a monastery. He trains the monks in the traditions of plainchant for daily services and prayers.

==Education==
In some universities in North America, preceptors are student volunteers who assist the professor and teaching assistants of a large lecture class by helping to design lessons, and holding office hours and review sessions. In some cases, volunteers are required to take outside classes focused on &quot;leadership development&quot;, where the final grade is determined by both the professor and a leadership development teacher. The term &quot;preceptor&quot; can also refer to a paid student grader.

At some universities, including Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford, &quot;preceptors&quot; are not students but faculty members teaching courses in writing, music, mathematics, languages or life sciences. In some departments, they are not tenured faculty but rather non-ladder faculty, generally PhDs, who help to administer courses. Harvard preceptors, who teach introductory writing, have included the &quot;New Yorker&quot; staff writer George Packer, the novelist Tom Perrotta, the former &quot;Boston Globe&quot; music critic Richard Dyer and the poet Dan Chiasson. At Columbia University, on the other hand, &quot;preceptors&quot; are senior graduate students who, along with senior faculty, teach courses on &quot;Literature Humanities&quot; and &quot;Contemporary Civilization&quot;. The title is also used to refer to teaching assistants at Princeton, who are typically graduate students.

At Elon University School of Law in North Carolina, a preceptor is an attorney who mentors two or three first-year law students.

==Health==
In medicine, allied health, midwifery, paramedicine, pharmacy and nursing education, a preceptor is a skilled practitioner or faculty member who supervises students in a clinical setting to allow practical experience with patients.

<text>The KS-23 is a Soviet shotgun. Because it uses a rifled barrel, it is officially designated by the Russian military as a carbine. KS stands for &quot;Karabin Spetsialniy&quot;, &quot;Special Carbine&quot;. It is renowned for its large caliber, firing a 23 mm shotgun shell, equating to 6.278 gauge using the British and American standards of shotgun gauges and approximately 4 gauge using the current European standards (based on the metric CIP tables), making it the largest-bore shotgun in modern use.

==History==
The KS-23 was designed in the 1970s for suppressing prison riots. It was created by TsNIITochMash, a key Soviet weapons developer, for the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). The barrel for the KS-23 were made from 23 mm aircraft gun barrels that were rejected due to manufacturing flaws. These rejected barrels were deemed to be acceptable for the lower stress of firing slugs and less-lethal rounds, and thus were cut down in length for use as shotgun barrels.
The KS-23 began to see use during the mid-1980s by several MVD forces. During the 1990s, research was made into improving the original design to make it usable in confined indoor areas. Two prototypes were proposed, the KS-23M and KS-23K, although only the M version saw use.

==Ammunition==
The KS-23 was created with the capability to fire several different types of ammunition, listed below:
* &quot;Shrapnel-10&quot; («&quot;Шрапнель-10&quot;»): buckshot round with 10-meter effective range
* &quot;Shrapnel-25&quot; («&quot;Шрапнель-25&quot;»): buckshot round with 25-meter effective range
* &quot;Barrikada&quot; («&quot;Баррикада&quot;», &quot;Barricade&quot;): cartridge with solid steel projectile able to destroy the engine block of a car at up to 100 meters
* &quot;Volna&quot; («&quot;Волна&quot;», &quot;Wave&quot;): inert version of cartridge used for education and practice during training
* &quot;Volna-R&quot; («&quot;Волна-Р&quot;», &quot;Wave&quot;): cartridge with less-lethal rubber bullet
* &quot;Strela-3&quot; («Стрела&quot;-3&quot;», &quot;Arrow&quot;): cartridge with less-lethal plastic bullet 
* &quot;Cheremukha-7&quot; («&quot;Черёмуха-7&quot;», &quot;Bird Cherry&quot;-7): tear gas grenade with CN agent
* &quot;Siren-7&quot; («&quot;Сирень-7&quot;», &quot;Lilac&quot;): tear gas grenade with CS agent
* &quot;Zvezda&quot; («&quot;Звезда&quot;», &quot;Star&quot;): flash-bang round
* PV-23 (&quot;ПВ-23&quot;): blank (grenade launching) cartridge

Later, two add-on muzzle mortars were produced, the 36 mm Nasadka-6 and 82 mm Nasadka-12, bringing with them several new ammunition types:

* Blank grenade launching cartridge to be used with muzzle mortars
* 36 mm &quot;Cheremukha-6&quot; tear gas grenade
* 82 mm &quot;Cheremukha-12&quot; &quot;high-efficiency&quot; tear gas grenade for use on open areas

==Variants==
===KS-23===
The original KS-23 was developed jointly by NIISpetstekhniki (MVD) and TsNIITochmash in 1971, it was accepted for use by the Soviet police in 1985. The gun has a barrel length of 510 mm and an overall length of 1040 mm. The KS-23 has an underbarrel tubular magazine capable of holding three rounds, with one in the chamber giving the gun a maximum round capacity of four. The gun&#x27;s effective range is 150 m.

===KS-23-1===
It is a short barrel version of KS-23.

===KS-23M===
The KS-23M &quot;Drozd&quot; (Carbine, Special, 23 mm, modernized &quot;Drozd&quot; &quot;Thrush&quot;) was developed on the base of the KS-23. Development for it was started in October 1990. Twenty-five carbines were submitted for testing on December 10, 1991. After which the winner, then designated S-3, became the KS-23M &quot;Drozd&quot; and was accepted for use by the police and the Internal Troops of Russia. The KS-23M includes a detachable wire buttstock and shortened barrel, as opposed to the fixed wooden stock on standard KS-23s. The gun is still chambered in 23 mm. Its overall length with the buttstock is 875 mm, without, 650 mm, and the barrel is 410 mm long. The gun&#x27;s effective range is 150 m.

===KS-23K===
The KS-23K is a redesigned KS-23 that features a bullpup layout. The KS-23K was accepted in 1998 for the use of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). Development and adoption of this carbine was motivated by the fact that in the earlier accepted configurations of the KS-23 and KS-23M a major noted deficiency was that the tubular magazine did not make it possible to rapidly reload or change the type of ammunition being used, because of this a major design change for the KS-23K is that it has an extended box magazine that holds seven shells instead of the three shells seen on the other models. The gun has a mechanical safety located on the left side, above the pistol handle and open non adjustable sights. The gun&#x27;s effective range is 100 m.

===TOZ-123===
The civilian version of the KS-23 is the ТОZ-123 &quot;Selezen&#x27;-4&quot; (&quot;Drake-4&quot;) (ТОЗ-123 «Селезень-4»). It is manufactured by Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod and features a smoothbore design, making it more similar to a traditional shotgun, and is chambered in standard 4 gauge. The first shotgun was made in 1995. It has been legal to use as a civilian hunting shotgun in Russia since August 1996.

The gun maker&#x27;s website has this as the description for the shotgun.

The shotgun is multicharged, with a tubular underbarrel magazine of 3-cartridge capacity. Reloading is provided with a removable fore-end. The presence of the special barrel rear projection on the frame combined with the rear sight gives the possibility of mounting an optical sight. The shotgun is intended for the amateur hunting with shot cartridges.

The TOZ-123 was banned from import into the United States during the Clinton administration.

<doc id="1143064" wikidata="Q377746" url="?curid=1143064" title="Ray Parlour">
<text>Raymond Parlour (born 7 March 1973) is an English former professional footballer and sports radio pundit for BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport.

He was a midfielder from 1992 to 2007, and spent his career playing for Arsenal, Middlesbrough and Hull City. He totalled 466 games and 32 goals for Arsenal, winning honours including three Premier League titles, four FA Cup and the 1994 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. He played ten games for England in 1999 and 2000.

While at Arsenal he was nicknamed &quot;The Romford Pelé&quot;, an ironic sobriquet reflecting his combination of solid performance with a humorous, self-deprecating, down to earth personality and an image wholly lacking in glamour. He has been described as an &quot;unsung hero&quot; and praised as a &quot;fans&#x27; favourite&quot; for his high work rate and commitment. After retiring, Parlour became a pundit on television and radio. In 2012, he briefly came out of retirement to play for Wembley in the club&#x27;s FA Cup fixtures.

==Club career==

===Arsenal===
Parlour is most famous for his time at Arsenal, where he played for fifteen years. He joined the club as a trainee in 1985, aged 12, and made his debut for the Gunners against Liverpool on 29 January 1992, conceding a penalty in a 2–0 defeat.

He rose to greater prominence in 1994–95, when he took part in Arsenal&#x27;s European UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final loss to Real Zaragoza (having been an unused substitute in the Gunners&#x27; 1–0 triumph over Parma in 1993–94). After the arrival of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal&#x27;s manager in 1996, he became a regular fixture on the right wing or in central midfield. In 1997–98 Arsenal won the Double, and Parlour was instrumental in his club&#x27;s achievement: he was man-of-the-match in the Gunners&#x27; FA Cup Final win over Newcastle United, setting up Nicolas Anelka for the second goal in a 2–0 win. His increasing success in his Gunners shirt did not, however, secure him a place in England&#x27;s 1998 World Cup squad, coach Glenn Hoddle preferring Spurs&#x27; Darren Anderton instead.

In March 2000, he hit a hat-trick in a 4–2 away win at Werder Bremen (6–2 aggregate) in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals. He was the only Arsenal player successful from the penalty spot in the team&#x27;s shoot-out defeat by Galatasaray in the final. Seven months later, he contributed another hat-trick to a 5–0 win over Newcastle United at Highbury. In April 2001, at the same ground, he struck a 30-yard winner as Arsenal beat Valencia 2–1 in the first leg tie of a UEFA Champions League quarter-final. In 2002, another year in which Arsenal won the Double, he opened the scoring in the Gunners&#x27; 2–0 FA Cup Final victory over Chelsea, putting his club ahead with a 30-yard strike that &quot;Soccer AM&quot;″s commentator Tim Lovejoy famously failed to anticipate: &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s all right, it&#x27;s only Ray Parlour&quot;. In November 2003, he was the stand-in captain who led his team to a 5–1 victory over Inter Milan at the San Siro.

In total, Parlour played 466 games for the Gunners, scoring 32 goals in all competitions. His &quot;curriculum vitae&quot; with the club includes three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup and one European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. As of April 2020, his record of 333 Premier League appearances for Arsenal has not been surpassed by any other player in the club&#x27;s history. Even at the peak of his success, though, he was less acclaimed by football journalists than several of his Arsenal contemporaries, spending much of his time at the club in the shadow of Patrick Vieira in particular. Many Arsenal fans believe him to have been one of the most underrated players of his generation.

===Middlesbrough===
In July 2004, Parlour joined fellow Premier League club Middlesbrough on a free transfer, signing a three-year contract at the Riverside Stadium. He played 60 games for Boro in two and a half years, and was an unused substitute in their 4–0 defeat by Sevilla in the 2006 UEFA Cup final. In October 2005, he was ruled out for two months for knee cartilage surgery. He was released from his contract on 25 January 2007, and returned to train at Arsenal.

===Hull City===
On 9 February 2007, Hull City signed Parlour until the end of the 2006–07 season in the hope that his experience would help them to avoid relegation. With their place in the Championship secured, it was confirmed on 1 June that the club would not be retaining Parlour&#x27;s services for the following season&#x27;s campaign.

===Wembley===
In June 2012, Parlour was one of several retired footballers enlisted by the semi-professional Wembley to assist them in the forthcoming season&#x27;s FA Cup. His fellow former internationals Claudio Caniggia, Graeme Le Saux, Martin Keown and Brian McBride joined him as players, David Seaman was recruited as a goalkeeping coach and Terry Venables, formerly the manager of England, served as the club&#x27;s technical advisor. A television documentary recorded the team&#x27;s improbable quest for Wembley Stadium glory. In the event, although Wembley knocked out Langford, the club proved unable to progress beyond a replay against Uxbridge.

==International career==
Parlour made his debut for the England under-21 team on 12 May 1992; he played the whole game as England drew 2–2 with Hungary in a friendly. He was a part of the squads that participated in the Toulon Tournament in 1992 and 1994, England would ultimately win the tournament in 1994 with Parlour playing in the final against Portugal. Parlour won the &quot;Prix Spécial&quot; award for his performances in the tournament.,
Overall, he appeared for the U21s on twelve occasions without scoring any goals. On 10 February 1998, he played for the B-team in a 1–0 loss to Chile at The Hawthorns.

He made his senior team debut as a substitute in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Poland on 27 March 1999; he won ten caps for England altogether, without ever scoring any goals. The closest he came to one was in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Finland on 11 October 2000, when he &#x27;scored&#x27; with a spectacular 30-yard strike which hit the crossbar and crossed the goal-line but was incorrectly disallowed by a linesman, the match finishing 0–0. He did not feature in any tournament finals, a knee injury forcing him to withdraw from England&#x27;s squad for Euro 2000. His final cap came in a friendly against Italy on 15 November 2000. He was called up into the squad several times by new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson in 2001, but was never sent onto the pitch.

Parlour&#x27;s lack of England appearances despite his domestic successes (particularly in comparison to some of his contemporaries) was often remarked upon. Parlour and fellow players attributed this to competition in midfield (David Beckham and later Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were usually chosen ahead of Parlour), as well as Parlour&#x27;s falling out with England manager Glenn Hoddle following Hoddle&#x27;s usage of a faith healer in the England camp for injured players.

==Media career==
Parlour began his career as a pundit with Setanta Sports in 2007. He has since appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport.

In 2019 and 2020, Parlour featured in both seasons of ITV show Harry&#x27;s Heroes, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.

==Personal life==
Parlour and his wife Karen were a couple from their early youth, although they did not get married until 1998. They have three children: Charlotte, Frankie and Georgina. Their separation in 2001 led to a very high-profile divorce. In July 2004, they agreed how to divide their existing wealthParlour giving Karen two mortgage-free houses and £250,000but they were unable to negotiate a mutually satisfactory arrangement over their income. Parlour thought that £120,000 a year would be enough to meet Karen&#x27;s and their children&#x27;s needs: Karen wanted more. The ensuing court case concluded in an award that increased Parlour&#x27;s annual payment to £212,500, but neither party was satisfied with this outcome, and both appealed against the finding. The couple&#x27;s second round of litigation resulted in Karen&#x27;s being awarded an income of £440,000 a year to be paid for five years, an amount that the Court of Appeal thought sufficient to allow her to put aside £250,000 a year to add to her capital. The case led media commentators to suggest that the finding heralded a new era in the divorces of wealthy couples, with non-earning spouses being awarded a larger share of their former partner&#x27;s income than hitherto, and some pundits forecast an increasing use of prenuptial agreements in consequence.

<text>Vila do Corvo () is the smallest municipality in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores, constituting the island of Corvo in its entirety. With a population of 430 in 2011, it is the least populated of the Portuguese municipalities, and the only Portuguese municipality, by law, without a civil parish (&quot;freguesia&quot;, the smallest administrative unit in Portugal). Its area is .

Vila do Corvo has at times been incorrectly referred to as &quot;Vila Nova do Corvo&quot;. The village, the unique agglomeration on the island of Corvo, is constructed of small homes located along narrow roadways and alleys rising along the hills of the southern one-third of the island. The coastal area of the village is dominated by the Corvo Aerodrome and ports linking the community to the outside world.

==History==


Despite the discovery of Carthaginian coins and the possible presence of a pre-Portuguese statue on Corvo, the current historical consensus is that the history of the Azores begins with non-official exploration during the period of the late 13th century in maps, such as the Genoese Medici Atlas (1351). Although it did not specify an island of Corvo, the Medici Atlas did refer to an &quot;Insula Corvi Marini&quot; (&#x27;Island of the Marine Crow&#x27;), in a seven-island archipelago. A later &quot;Mapa Catalão&quot; (&#x27;Catalan Map&#x27;), from Spain, referred to two islands of Corvo and Flores in 1375.

During Portuguese &#x27;official history&#x27; the Western Group was discovered during the navigator Diogo de Teive and his son&#x27;s (João de Teive) 1452 return from the Banks of Newfoundland, after his second voyage of exploration. The Portuguese Court began to refer to the new &quot;Ilhas das Flores&quot; (&#x27;Islands of Flowers&#x27;), identifying Corvo as the &quot;Ilha de Santa Iria&quot; (&#x27;Island of Saint Irene&#x27;), but other nautical charts continued to refer to this island as the &quot;Ilhéu das Flores&quot; (&#x27;Islet or Island of Flowers&#x27;), &quot;Ilha da Estátua&quot; (&#x27;Island of the Statue&#x27;), &quot;Ilha do Farol&quot; (&#x27;Island of the Lighthouse&#x27;) or &quot;Ilha de São Tomás&quot; (&#x27;Island of Saint Thomas&#x27;). The island was placed under the control of Diogo Teive, who became the first Captain-Donatário.

Regardless, it was only in the following year that King Afonso V of Portugal &quot;recognized&quot; these new discoveries (January 20, 1453) and donated them to his uncle, Afonso, Duke of Braganza and Count of Barcelos. The first proprietor showed little interest in settlement, sending only the obligatory cattle to settle the island and establish his legitimate possession.

Fernão Telles, the third Captain-Donatário between 1475 and 1503, was the first to attempt to colonize Corvo (contracting with the Flemish entrepreneur Willem van der Haegen), but abandoned his settlement after a couple of years. By 1507, the islands of both Corvo and Flores were identified by Valentim Fernandes as unpopulated. Diogo das Chagas also referred to an initial settlement of 30 people, under contract of the Terceirenses Antão Vaz and Lopo Vaz de Azevedo (1508–1510), who had little success on Corvo; they eventually returned to Terceira in 1515, leaving António Silveira de Machado in charge. But the settlement did not persist. Following these successive failed attempts to settle the land, Gonçalo de Sousa (second Captain-Donatário of the islands of Corvo and Flores) was authorized to send slaves (likely from the island of Santo Antão in the Cape Verde archipelago) to Flores and Corvo as farmers and cattlemen (November 12, 1548).

In 1570, the building that would later become the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres was constructed.

Around 1580, colonists from Flores arrived on Corvo, and a small self-sufficient, isolated settlement was formed. These Corvinos eked out a meagre existence, dedicating their venture to subsistence crops and grazing sheep and/or goats, along with fishing offshore. Commerce and trade primarily occurred across the channel, but weather conditions restricted maritime connections with the rest of the islands to between March and September. As Gaspar Frutuoso later indicated, by the end of the 16th century the population consisted of houses &quot;...of 20 neighbours, renters and masters&#x27; blacks...certain slaves, and married mulattos with slaves...&quot;.

Along with Flores, the island passed into the hands of Martinho de Mascarenhas in 1593. But the situation economically became aggravated and desperate: the annual payments to the seigneur increased; the local population increased; the connection with the outside world reluctantly forced a level of self-sufficiency; it became impossible to increase the area under cultivation; and there were frequent incursions by English privateers, that marked the conflict during the Iberian Union.

Much like other Azorean communities in the late 16th century, piracy and privateering marked their local history, even as some locals collaborated with or befriended these raiders. In exchange for protection and payments, the islanders provided fresh water, provisions and men, as well as permitting the treatment of the sick and repairing vessels. But in 1587 Corvo was sacked by English privateers who had attacked Lajes das Flores. Then, in 1632, Barbary coast pirates (from the Ottoman Empire) twice attempted to disembark in &quot;Porto da Casa&quot;, which was only a small bay (and an area that was easily accessible to pirates). In one account, while the men were in the hills looking after their flocks and the women were in their homes, a large group of pirates arrived in the vicinity of the settlement. The pirates fired on the settlement, and were met by rocks thrown from the cliff-tops. During the battle, the local vicar carried his small image of &quot;Nossa Senhora do Rosário&quot; (&#x27;Our Lady of the Rosary&#x27;) into the battle, and placed it along the &quot;Canada da Rocha&quot;. The statue had for many years been placed in the area of &quot;Porto da Casa&quot;, but had been moved to the altar of the small chapel on the cliff. The battle was arduous, but 200 Corvinos were able to defeat the pirates, capturing many weapons, with no loss of life and while capturing a Moor. It is said that the victory was credited to the statue, which depicted the patron saint of Corvo, and had mysteriously deflected many of the pirates&#x27; rounds. The pirates retreated and did not return to the small island. Thereafter the statue became known as the statue of &quot;Nossa Senhora dos Milagres&quot; (&#x27;Our Lady of Miracles&#x27;). It was the second parish priest, the Florentine Inácio Coelho (brother of the Diogo das Chagas), who was able to convince Martinho de Mascarenhas (the second Captain-Donatário) to assist the parish &quot;in the name of the Virgin Mary&quot;. Today the statue is located in the parochial church.

The parish of Corvo was created in 1674: its first pastor was the Faialense Bartolomeu Tristão. Until this time the colony was annually visited by a priest from Santa Cruz das Flores, sent by the Bishop of Angra to tend to the isolated community.

In the 18th century, American whalers arrived in Flores to recruit crews and harpooners, and to re-provision their ships for their campaigns. Due to their experience, inhabitants from Corvo signed onto these crews, thus beginning a close relationship with the New England community of North America that would continue into the 20th century (at times, this connection was more direct than its connection to Lisbon). Consequently, clandestine emigration was a constant of life, and a problem for the repressive Portuguese authorities, who were preoccupied with defections from obligatory military service and reductions in the island&#x27;s tribute. The settlers on Corvo were obliged to pay a tithe to their Captains-Donatário, and after 1759 (with the death of the 8th Duke of Aveiro and Count of Santa Cruz), to the Crown. During the Liberal Wars, a delegation from Corvo approached Regent Peter IV of Portugal to present the grave sentiments of the population and request that their payments be alleviated. Manuel Tomás de Avelar, chief of the Corvino delegation, traveled to Angra do Heroísmo to petition the liberal leadership of the Angra Regency. It was Mouzinho da Silveira who attempted to mitigate this servitude with a proposal to reduce the tithe payment (in wheat) and taxes, owing to the persistent poverty on the island. A decree was promulgated on May 14, 1832, by Peter IV and signed in Ponta Delgada, which reduced the tithe paid to the Crown&#x27;s Donatário (then Pedro José Caupers) in half (to 20 &quot;moios&quot; [] of wheat), as well as the elimination of the annual payment of 80,000 &quot;réis&quot;. The Crown would then assume the indemnity of the Donatário. The tribute was completely abolished by 1835.

On June 20, 1832, the Regent, Peter IV of Portugal, elevated the settlement of Corvo to the status of village and municipal seat. Until this time, Corvo had been under the jurisdiction of Santa Cruz das Flores as a civil parish of its neighbor across the channel. And after 1853, the foral (the town&#x27;s royal charter) granted to the dual jurisdiction was extinguished, resulting in a liberal movement, where tenant farmers were able to raise their cattle and till their own lands, marking out a subsistence economy that supported porting ships.

In 1886 the Civil Governor of the District of Horta, Manuel Francisco de Medeiros, asked the inhabitants what they wanted on visiting the community. He was surprised by the humble request for a Portuguese national flag for the island. It came into use when Albert of Monaco visited the island during his oceanographic and photographic expeditions. It was also visited in 1924 by the Portuguese writer Raul Brandão, who contributed to local myths and idyllic republican community with his work &quot;Ilhas Desconhecidas&quot;.

From the beginning of the 19th and into the 20th century, emigration continued unabated, except for a period between 1925 and 1955, as more Corvinos left the island in search of economic security—a process that continued well into the 1980s. By 1938, the island received its first permanent medical resident, João Rodrigues Ferreira da Silva, who lived on the island until 1945, and for whom the only medical building was named.

On April 10, 1997, the urban nucleus of the village of Corvo consisted primarily of the old one and two-storey house/barns that populated the centre of the municipality and were classified as an &#x27;architectural group of public interest&#x27; () by the Regional Government of the Azores, supported by IGESPAR.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
===Climate===
Vila do Corvo has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with warm summers and mild winters. Despite being at the same latitude, Vila do Corvo is on average warmer than Long Beach Island, New Jersey, mainly due to the effect of the Gulf Stream.

===Human geography===

The Vila do Corvo is implanted along the maritime coast of the island of Corvo, and represents the only inhabited settlement on the island. With a perimeter of , the settlement is dominated by the sheer cliffs of the extinct volcanic crater of the Caldeirão, which extend above sea level. The urban area covers an incredibly small by on an ancient debris field in the south, along the cove of Nossa Senhora do Rosário. The landscape north of the settlement is characterized by agricultural fields and pastureland, divided by stone walls.

In the last part of the 19th century, a 9% drop in the population marked a period of emigration to the United States, generally associated with most of the archipelago. Yet continued emigration between Corvo and New England would mark the demographic oscillation during the 20th century, as well. There were four identifiable periods:
* the first period, until 1925, when the United States began restricting immigration and the local population diminished by 18%
* the second period, until 1955, during a period of emigration to Latin America, (principally to Brazil) that was fairly insignificant, but resulted in a 10% increase in the population
* a third period, which lasted until the beginning of the 1980s, coincident with a new wave of emigration, resulting in a 49% decrease in the local residents
* finally, from the 1980s until the beginning of the 21st century, resulting from new restrictions on emigration, and local social and economic development, that resulted in little change
In the last 14 years that population has seen a 12.5% increase, which is attributed to the following factors:
* the return of émigrés 
* the appearance of new employment opportunities, in addition to the creation of a basic education primary school, which helped to fix the young population

==Economy==
Generally, the inhabitants dedicate themselves to fishing, agriculture, or raising cattle. Most services on the island support these activities, as well as annual tourism.

Although the island is small, the municipal government constructed a small campsite in the area of Praia da Areia, with washrooms, barbecues and picnic tables in order to support annual eco-friendly visitors to the island.

==Architecture==
The centre of Vila do Corvo, situated in the eastern part of the &quot;Rua da Matriz&quot; and characterized by a group of narrow roads, alleyways and a labyrinth of buildings, is the historic town. The buildings are generally two-storey, south-facing, tile-roofed constructions. Some of these buildings continue to have spaces for pig-pens, corrals and annexes aligned to the alleyways.

===Public buildings===
* Correios, Telégrafos e Telefones (CTT) Building (), common on many of the islands of the Azores, the CTT building is a 20th-century construction located in the &quot;Largo do Ribeirão&quot;
* Pit of Junça (), a subterranean silo in the form of an amphora, used to store cereals, constructed in the 18th century 
* Lighthouse of Ponta Negra (), located west of the small port of Boqueirão, alongside the windmills of Corvo, it was established in 1910 to secure the southern coast of the island
* Public Office Building (), the building of the antique public finances for the island of Corvo, built during the 20th century
* Residence of Mariana Lopes ()
* Threshing Circle (Avenida Nova) ()
* Windmills of Corvo () – a group of three windmills located along the &quot;Caminhos dos Moinhos&quot; (Windmill Ways), constructed of volcanic rock in a conical form, with a wooden roof and octagonal sails, accessed by elevated doorways with volcanic lateral symmetrical steps

===Religious structures===
* Church of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (), the 18th-century parish church constructed in 1570 and remodelled in the Baroque style, which houses the legendary image of Our Lady of the Miracles who &quot;miraculously&quot; saved the Corvinos from pirate attacks during the 16th century
* Império of the Divino Espirito Santo (), a simple rectangular building used for celebrations tied to the Cult of the Holy Spirit, constructed around 1871

==Culture==
The island celebrates annual celebrations marking the feast day of its patron saint, Our Lady of Miracles (), on August 15. The event is actually a week-long religious celebration of prayer, with an evening candle-light procession on the evening of August 14, before the events on August 15, which include a solemn mass. Connected with this celebration is the annual &quot;Festival dos Moinhos&quot; (literally, Festival of the Windmills), a secular musical event that attracts tourists and returning emigrants to the tiny island, featuring local and popular musical talent.

<doc id="1143105" wikidata="Q1075698" url="?curid=1143105" title="Marauders (comics)">
<text>The Marauders refers to one of two teams of fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The original Marauders team included mutant warriors and assassins employed by the X-Men&#x27;s enemy Mister Sinister, a mad scientist villain often intent on creating a perfect race of superhumans. At different times, the Marauders have been tasked by Sinister to perform kidnappings, assassinations, mass murder, or simply fight Sinister&#x27;s enemies. At different times, Marauders have been killed in combat, but often Mr. Sinister later uses his cloning technology to re-create them. This team of Marauders has appeared in many different stories of the X-Men franchise, as well as stories featuring other Marvel Comics heroes.

In 2019, the Dawn of X event involved the X-Men and many allies and enemies creating a new all-mutant country on the living island Krakoa. Teleport gates that only work for mutants were then created at various points on Earth, allowing any mutant who wished to join the new community to instantly do so. Kitty Pryde then formed a new team of &quot;Marauders&quot; to transport mutants to Krakoa who lived in countries that did not recognize the sovereignty of the mutant nation and/or obstructed the local teleport gates leading to the island. This team also works to protect mutant travelers and refugees from threats. The team&#x27;s series &quot;Marauders&quot; debuted in 2019.

==Publication history==

=== 1986–2000 ===
The first Marauders team debuted in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #210 (Oct. 1986), during a crossover called the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; where the team was sent to slaughter a community of sewer-dwelling mutants called Morlocks. This issue introduced the characters Arclight, Harpoon, Malice, Scalphunter, Scrambler, and Riptide. With the exception of Malice, these characters only appeared in issue #210 as figures in silhouette, but then made their full debut in the following issue &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #211. Two other Marauders known as Blockbuster and Prism made their first appearance in a later chapter of the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; featured in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #10. The original Marauders team also included the villains Sabretooth and Vertigo, but each had actually been introduced into comics years earlier, while the rest of the Marauders were created for the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; story by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr. Vertigo had originally been introduced in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; #1 (1982), while Sabretooth had debuted as an Iron Fist villain in &quot;Iron Fist&quot; #14 (1977) and then made appearances in Spider-Man stories before it was decided to make him a Marauder and bring him into the X-Men franchise. &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #212, during the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, was the first story to hint at a connection between Sabretooth and the X-Man called Wolverine.

In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #212, Mr. Sinister is mentioned as the leader of the Marauders. He is seen in silhouette in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #213 (1986) when Sabretooth&#x27;s mind is scanned. He does not appear with the team (or debut in comics) until &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #221 (1987). Although it is Sinister&#x27;s team, it is later revealed in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #350 (1997) it was the mutant thief (and later X-Men member) Gambit who recruited and organized the team with the exception of Sabretooth and Scalphunter (whom had already worked for Sinister many times). Gambit was unaware of the team&#x27;s true purpose, using his skills to locate the members in exchange for Sinister helping him. Gambit is also said to be the one who led the Marauders to the Morlocks location, but this seems to contradict scenes in &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; where the team tracks a young Morlock returning home.

During &quot;Mutant Massacre,&quot; three Marauders are killed: Blockbuster in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #374, Riptide in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #211, and Prism in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #10. However, all three appeared alive and well two years later during the 1989 &quot;Inferno&quot; crossover issues &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #240. 

Five years later, &quot;X-Men&quot; #34 (1994) revealed that Sinister regularly clones dead Marauders so they can serve him again. &quot;Gambit&quot; vol. 3 #8 (1999) adds that each Marauder clone is made so their minds will shut down if they attempt to betray Sinister. The 1996 miniseries &quot;The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix&quot; revealed that Sinister hired a group of criminals known as the Marauders during the 19th century, making it retroactively the first incarnation of the group.

=== 2000–2019 ===
&quot;X-Men&quot; #200 (2007) featured the original Marauders team with several new members, including Omega Sentinel (possessed by Malice), Lady Mastermind, Sunfire, Gambit, and Mystique. The team worked alongside members of the Acolytes team. Following Sinister&#x27;s apparent death during the crossover &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, many dormant Marauder clones awakened and fought the new X-Force team in &quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 3) #9. The one-shot &quot;X-Men Origins: Gambit&quot; (2009) includes flashbacks to Gambit&#x27;s recruitment of the Marauders – the comic&#x27;s writer Mike Carey highlighted that artist David Yardin &quot;depicts the first meeting of the Marauders, the first time they&#x27;re all together in one room, and you get a sense of how powerful and overbearing these personalities are and the tensions between them&quot;.

In &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; (vol. 3) #48, a new version of the Marauders appeared whose members included: Arclight, Blockbuster, Harpoon, Prism, Vanisher, and Chimera (serving as the new leader). Mister Sinister later formed another incarnation of the Marauders team consisting of Aries, Azimuth, Chimera, and Coda. Several of the original Marauders (or at least their clones) were later confronted and killed by the mutant Chamber in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #18 (2019).

=== 2019–2024 (Krakoan Age) ===
The X-Men franchise titles were rebooted for the 2019 event Dawn of X. Professor X, Magneto, and the X-Men, along with many mutant allies and former enemies, created a new mutant community on the living island of Krakoa, a self-sufficient country where they offered sanctuary to any mutant who wished to join them. Various teleport gates were created across Earth to allow mutants entry to Krakoa; if a mutant brings a human with them voluntarily, that human must ask for permission from Krakoa to use the gateway. Kate Pryde then created a team to help transport those mutants whose native countries did not recognize Krakoa and/or blocked the local gates that would allow mutants to travel there. Kate named this team the Marauders, and recruited the former X-Men Iceman, Storm, and Bishop, along with Pyro. The team appears in their own series &quot;Marauders&quot;, which started publication in 2019. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; highlighted that &quot;the Marauders are functionally the Krakoan navy in the Dawn of X era and are an extension of both the X-Men and the high stakes machinations of the Hellfire Club&quot;.

In the 2020 series &quot;Hellions&quot;, the team heads to Nebraska to destroy Mr. Sinister&#x27;s defunct clone farm, however, they discover &quot;that Sinister&#x27;s original team of Marauders have been strung up like pigs in a butcher shop&quot;. These Marauders had been turned into zombie-like slaves of Madelyne Pryor; Pryor planned on attacking Krakoa with clones of the Marauders. Afterwards, the Quiet Council approves the resurrection of the original Marauders.

The &quot;Marauders&quot; series was then relaunched in 2022 as part of Destiny of X. In the second volume, Captain Pryde with Bishop recruit a new team of Marauders in &quot;Marauders Annual&quot; #1 – the initial roster included Aurora, Daken, Psylocke (Kwannon), Somnus, and Tempo. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; commented that in the first volume the Marauders were &quot;tasked with protecting the interests of the Hellfire Trading Company&#x27;s black-market and rescuing mutant refugees feeling from unfriendly nations, returning them to safety on Krakoa. Now that most of the world&#x27;s mutants have been relocated to Krakoa from dangerous territories, and X-Force taking on more responsibility with retrieving stolen Hellfire goods, Pryde is repositioning her Marauders team as a mutant Search and Rescue squad&quot;.

==Fictional team biography==
In Victorian London, during the 1860s, Nathaniel Essex is a biologist and surgeon interested in evolution and the work of Charles Darwin. His interest becomes an obsession after the death of his son Adam due to multiple birth defects. Believing morality has no place in scientific research, Essex decides to experiment on humans to further his research into human genetics, hoping to one day create a perfect race. He meets the criminal Cootie Tremble and his gang, the Marauders, and hired them. For years, the Marauders kidnap homeless and neglected people off the streets of London, bringing them to Essex&#x27;s lab for his experiments. One test subject who survives is a man named Daniel Summers (an ancestor of the X-Man Scott Summers AKA Cyclops). During this time, Essex meets the Egyptian terrorist and cult leader En Sabah Nur, who might be the earliest example of a mutant on Earth, a person born with an X-gene that grants them superhuman powers and/or traits. Like Essex, En Sabah Nur (who will later be known as Apocalypse) believes in &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, though their methods and ultimate goals differ.

After his wife Rebecca discovers his work and condemns him, dying during labor soon afterward, Essex decides to leave behind his humanity. Using alien technology, Apocalypse turns Essex into an ageless superhuman with chalk-white skin. Essex takes on the name &quot;Mister Sinister&quot; (a reference to how his wife saw him before her death). Though he later cuts ties with the criminal Marauders before moving his operations to America, Sinister repeatedly decides to recruit other agents to act in his stead and serve as his protectors (which becomes more important to Essex after he decides he needs soldiers to use against Apocalypse).

In 1907, Sinister works at the Ravencroft Institute and temporarily employs the mutant killer Sabretooth as an agent. During World War II, Sinister works with the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele. In 1944, John Greycrow of the US Army is executed by firing squad for murdering fellow officers. A mutant with the ability to regenerate from even potentially lethal wounds, Greycrow emerges from his grave and finds Mr. Sinister waiting. Sinister explains he learned of Greycrow&#x27;s abilities and deadly nature and wishes to recruit him. Greycrow accepts, calling himself Scalphunter. Around this time, Sinister creates a clone of the Atlantean warrior Namor, the Sub-Mariner, calling it N2. After the clone is defeated by Captain America, and seeing that the Nazis will lose the war, Sinister and Greycrow leave to pursue their own agenda. Sinister&#x27;s research during World War II is later recovered and used by the scientists behind the Weapon X project.

Sometime later during the Vietnam War, Scalphunter brings soldiers and civilians to Sinister for experimentation. Sabretooth, working as a mercenary, is hired to find the truth about the &quot;White Devil&quot; and his connection to reports of missing people, as well as the rumors of &quot;monster men&quot; appearing. Scalphunter tells Sabretooth to leave him and Sinister alone, offering money and teasing that he will let the authorities know the mercenary has been killing prostitutes during his investigation. Sabretooth agrees to leave with the money and Scalphunter indicates that he and Sinister will recruit him in the future.

Many years later, a version of the mutant scientist Hank McCoy arrives on Earth from another timeline where Apocalypse rules. This version of McCoy, called the Dark Beast, is an amoral student and lab assistant of his timeline&#x27;s version of Sinister. Journeying to New York City, he experiments on several mutants, using the techniques Sinister taught him, in order to see how much he can change or enhance mutation. Several of his surviving test subjects decide to hide from the world, joining the underground community known as the Morlocks. Years later, Dark Beast&#x27;s experiments indirectly lead to the &quot;Mutant Massacre.&quot;

Becoming aware of the mutant teenagers Scott Summers and Jean Grey, Sinister concludes that their combined genetic codes could create a near-perfect mutant, one powerful enough to destroy Apocalypse. Since Jean Grey is already being mentored and watched over by the powerful telepath Professor Charles Xavier, Sinister spends years focusing much of his efforts on manipulating Scott Summers. To aid in this, Sinister brings the orphaned Scott to the Essex State Home for Foundlings in Nebraska, an orphanage he secretly runs and uses to monitor and experiment on mutant children. Eventually, Scott leaves the orphanage and is also recruited by Xavier. However, Sinister retrieves cell samples from them and begins working on perfecting his cloning process. When Scott and Jean become founding members of Xavier&#x27;s counter-terrorist strike force, the X-Men, Sinister decides to obtain fresh DNA samples from all of them. Rather than use Scalphunter or Sabretooth, he hires Kraven the Hunter and the Blob to get the job done.

=== Forming the first Marauders team ===
Years after joining the X-Men, Jean Grey joins with the powerful Phoenix Force. After months of wielding her new cosmic power, Jean is temporarily corrupted, causing the Phoenix Force to warp into a new, murderous persona called Dark Phoenix. To prevent the Dark Phoenix from causing harm, Jean seemingly kills herself. Her death inadvertently activates Sinister&#x27;s clone of Jean Grey and he decides to use it to further manipulate Cyclops. Named &quot;Madelyne Pryor,&quot; the clone encounters Cyclops, and the two fall in love. After marrying and having a child, Nathan Summers, they move to Alaska.

Meanwhile, Sinister decides that the sewer-dwelling mutant community known as the Morlocks represents the worst kind of mutants possible and should not be allowed to risk mixing with the gene pool of other mutants and humans. He is further angered when his studies reveal that several Morlocks bear signs of genetic manipulation based on his own research (due to the fact that many of them were experimented on by Dark Beast). Disgusted that someone has used his &quot;signature&quot; without his permission, Sinister decides to wipe out the Morlocks living in Manhattan&#x27;s sewers. He hires the mutant thief Gambit to recruit a team of warriors and assassins who will work with Sabretooth and Scalphunter. In exchange, he performs surgery on Gambit to correct a defect that would have ensured the mutant thief would one day lose control of his powers. Recalling the criminals he worked with in London, Mr. Sinister decides to christen his first official team of agents &quot;the Marauders.&quot;

Before Sinister sends his Marauders against the Morlocks, Jean Grey is discovered alive and well by the Avengers. Her former X-Men comrades are contacted and a shocked Scott Summers leaves Alaska to see for himself that it&#x27;s actually her. Rather than return home to his wife and child, Scott remains with his old teammates as they form a new team called X-Factor. It is later said this is because Sinister uses his mental influence over Cyclops to encourage him to leave behind Madelyne and Nathan, making them easy targets. With Cyclops gone, Sinister sends his newly formed Marauders to attack the now undefended Summers house in Alaska. The Marauders kidnap Nathan, leaving Maddie injured and near-death. Unbeknownst to Sinister, she survives the ordeal, is taken to a hospital and slips into a coma.

=== &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; and &quot;Inferno&quot; ===
Returning to New York, the Marauders are sent after the Morlocks. Using his stealth and tracking skills, Gambit leads the group to the secret Morlock community in the sewers but abandons the group when he learns they intend to murder the people living there. The Marauders dismiss Gambit and begin their slaughter, causing the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; event, a series of battles that include the X-Men, X-Factor, and other heroes such as Thor. During the fighting, the Marauders Prism, Riptide, and Blockbuster are killed in action. However, Sinister has now perfected his cloning techniques and simply recreates them. He also uses his scientific skill and mental abilities to ensure that the minds of the Marauder clones will shut down if they decide to betray him.

Following the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, the remaining Marauders attack the X-Men&#x27;s base at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters (also known as the X-Mansion) in Westchester, New York. Scanning the mind of Sabretooth, the X-Man called Psylocke learns the massacre was ordered by someone called &quot;Sinister&quot;, alerting the X-Men to his presence for the first time. The attack fails, but the Marauders later attack former X-Men member Polaris. Malice succeeds in possessing her mind and then becomes the field leader of the team. After it was discovered that Madelyne Pryor was alive and recovered, the Marauders tried and failed to assassinate her. She rejoined the company of the X-Men, traumatized by the loss of her son and convinced Cyclops had abandoned them.

Maddie&#x27;s resentment and anger start to corrupt her, leading her to make a deal with demons. Transformed into the demonically powered &quot;Goblyn Queen,&quot; Madelyne is at the heart of the &quot;Inferno&quot; crossover as Hell-bound forces cross into Earth&#x27;s dimensions. During this time, the Mauraders face Madelyne again, now joined by Sinister who reveals her true origin as a clone. Many of the Marauders are killed during &quot;Inferno,&quot; and Maddie later dies herself, her life force and memories merging with those of Jean Grey. Sinister confronts the X-Men and X-Factor teams, revealing how he manipulated both Maddie and Cyclops. Cyclops unleashes a powerful optic blast that seemingly kills Sinister, leaving only bones. This is later revealed to be a ruse performed by Mr. Sinister, who decided it was best to retreat. Without Sinister, the Marauders Sabretooth, Blockbuster, and Malice continue their own attacks on the X-Men. Not long afterward, Sinister appears again, now with a new group called the Nasty Boys. In later adventures, Sinister works with the Marauders again rather than the Nasty Boys, though at times the group seems to follow its own agenda.

In the alternate reality called &quot;Age of Apocalypse,&quot; the native version of Sinister uses DNA from Jean Grey and Scott Summers to create a powerful mutant called Nate Grey. After Nate transports to the mainstream Marvel reality and makes a home there, Sinister&#x27;s agent Threnody befriends him. When she refuses to work for Sinister further, he sends the Marauders and they battle Nate Grey. Using his telepathy, Nate causes Arclight to kill Blockbuster, then manipulates Riptide to kill Arclight. It is soon after this that Gambit discovers Sinister keeps clones of all the Marauders, ready in the event of their deaths. He rarely attempts to clone Sabretooth, whose healing abilities and feral nature make even his clones resistant to mental control.

=== Later teams ===
A new incarnation of the team emerges years later, consisting of Malice (now possessing Omega Sentinel). Lady Mastermind, Sunfire, Gambit, and Mystique, who have all aligned themselves with the former Acolytes known as Exodus, Random, Frenzy, Tempo, and Unuscione. The team is sent after a list of mutants, many of whom are native to alternate timelines and possible future eras. During this assignment, the team kills Vargas and Dark Mother, and destroys Wohnhaus Strucker, a building with ties to the future. They seemingly kill the mutant teleporter Gateway and the time traveler Cable (a grown-up version of Nathan Summers), but both later turn up alive. Though they try to kill Blindfold, she escapes. The Marauders also seek out the diaries of the dead psychic mutant Destiny, but the books in the X-Mansion are destroyed.

The Marauders play a major role in &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex&quot;, sent by Sinister to track down the first mutant child born after &quot;M-Day,&quot; an event that stripped most mutants of their X-genes and powers. During a battle on Muir Island, the Marauders Scrambler and Vertigo seemingly die. Mr. Sinister is killed by Mystique, but is able to transfer his consciousness into a host before then growing a new clone body for himself.

Following Sinister&#x27;s apparent death, a large contingent of Marauder clones awaken and fight the newest team called X-Force, a black ops team. Nearly all the clones are killed.

Da&#x27;o Coy Manh, the half-sister of the mutant known as Karma, forms a new incarnation of the Marauders in order to take revenge on her father. The new lineup includes: Arclight, Blockbuster, Harpoon, Prism, and Vanisher, with Chimera as the apparent new leader.

=== Magneto&#x27;s Marauders ===
With the exceptions of Malice and Sabretooth, many clones of the other Marauders still exist. Deciding they are long overdue for vengeance in the name of the Morlocks their predecessors killed, Magneto hunts down and kills these clones, except for one of Scalphunter, whose limbs are dismembered. After tracking a group of remaining clones that have yet to be activated, Magneto decides instead to alter their personalities to obey his own commands in the future.

Following World War Hate, Magneto leads various mutants through the island of Genosha. Magneto later unleashes his loyal Marauder clones against the international intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., using them as a distraction while he destroys much of the organization&#x27;s collected data on mutants. Magneto and his Marauders then retreat and go separate ways. Magneto kills the Sabretooth clone when he realizes its feral nature and healing abilities make it resistant to his mental loyalty programming. He and the Marauders apparently part ways later on.

=== All-New, All-Different Marvel ===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Mister Sinister forms another incarnation of the Marauders in order to capture Nightcrawler. This team includes Aries, Azimuth, Chimera, and Coda.

After being manipulated by Emma Frost, the Marauders reform with Scalphunter, Arclight, Harpoon, Blockbuster, Vertigo, and Malice. The X-Men confronts this group, accusing them of committing a second Morlock Massacre. The Marauders deny this charge, but the X-Man Chamber burns them alive with his psionic flame. As he burns, Harpoon impales Chamber in the back, killing the young mutant.

=== Dawn of X ===
In the 2019 Dawn of X event, Xavier and Magneto work with the X-Men, as well as many allies and former enemies, to create a new mutant nation and sanctuary on the living island of Krakoa. Krakoa creates teleport gates around the Earth so that mutants (and only mutants) may be able to travel to its land instantaneously and join the new community. However, some countries do not recognize the sovereignty of Krakoa and block their local gates in order to prevent their own mutant citizens from leaving. To aid these mutants who cannot access the gates, Kitty Pryde forms a new group she calls the Marauders, recruiting her now reformed enemy Pyro as well as former teammates Storm, Iceman, and Bishop.

Mister Sinister, Scalphunter, and Sabretooth join the Krakoa community. The other living former Marauders refuse to come to Krakoa, taking shelter in Sinister&#x27;s former orphanage base in Nebraska. While Sinister is left alone due to now being a member of Krakoa&#x27;s ruling Quiet Council, Scalphunter is confronted by Morlocks on the island who inform him it is the anniversary of the Mutant Massacre. Rather than seek to make amends, Scalphunter remorselessly answers with violence and reveals a hidden weapon. He is later grouped with other mutants who are having trouble fitting in with the new community due to aggressive, violent, or villainous attitudes. At Sinister&#x27;s suggestion, the group becomes a new team of Hellions whom he hopes to rehabilitate through a form of group therapy. The former X-Men member Psylocke joins Sinister as overseer of the group.

For their first mission, the new Hellions go to Sinister&#x27;s orphanage in order to confront the original Marauders, only to learn they have become zombie-like beings under the control of Madelyne Pryor.

==Members==
===Original roster===
===Second roster===

During the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; storyline, five former X-Men joined the original roster of the Marauders, and Sabretooth was not among the group.

* Gambit (Remy LeBeau): Before joining the X-Men, Gambit was hired by Sinister to assemble the Marauders. Feeling responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Morlocks, Gambit kept this a secret from the X-Men until Rogue absorbed his memories and found out Gambit&#x27;s secret. His brainwashing by Apocalypse and manipulation by Sinister led him to abandon the X-Men, though he has since returned to the team.
* Lady Mastermind (Regan Wyngarde): An illusion-creating mutant and one of Jason Wyngarde&#x27;s (the original Mastermind) daughters.
* Mystique: A shapeshifter, mother of Nightcrawler and the adoptive mother of Rogue. She infiltrated the X-Men in order to betray them from within.
* Sunfire (Shiro Yoshida): A Japanese mutant and former X-Man with fire generation and manipulation abilities.
* Omega Sentinel (Karima Shapandar)
* Exodus (Bennet Du Paris)

===Third roster===
After the &quot;Schism&quot; storyline, two enemies of the X-Men joined the Marauders.

* Chimera: A former interdimensional pirate from an unknown Earth, who can generate dragon-shaped flares of greenish-transparent ectoplasmic energy to strike her enemies on various planes of being (i.e. physical, astral, etc.).
* Vanisher (Telford Porter): Longtime criminal and former member of the X-Force, he possesses the ability to teleport himself, his clothes, and an as yet undetermined amount of additional mass.

===Fourth roster===
Magneto eventually tracked the original Marauders&#x27; remaining clones, except for Sabretooth and Malice, and killed them all, which activated new clones of them. He prevented the activation of the clones and programmed them to deploy at his command in the future. Scalphunter was also spared, though his arms and legs were severed.

===Fifth roster===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Mister Sinister has formed another incarnation of the Marauders. Besides Chimera, this membership consisted of:

* Aries: A mutant with the horns and hindquarters of a ram. Aries has no connections with the Zodiac.
* Azimuth: A female mutant who can unhinge her jaws to form an oral singularity/black hole that can disrupt even Nightcrawler&#x27;s teleportation.
* Coda: A mummified mutant with a forked tongue.

===Miss Sinister&#x27;s New Marauders===
Following the rebirth of the Multiverse in the aftermath of Secret Wars, Miss Sinister had made her presence known and assembled several mutants that became stranded from the Ultimate Marvel into the Prime Universe which she personally handpicked and trained to be killers. Those among her New Marauders are:

* Jimmy Hudson: Rescued by the X-Men Blue team and defected the New Marauders.
* Guardian (Derek Morgan)
* Quicksilver
* Armor
* Mach-II (Nomi Blume)
* Malice

Miss Sinister kept experimenting on the New Marauders, granting them secondary mutations through a method called the &quot;Mothervine&quot;. However, not all attempts were successful, with one of them resulting in Quicksilver&#x27;s death. Pietro&#x27;s body was left behind by Miss Sinister in her base once she abandoned it, and it was eventually found by the young X-Men while investigating, nevertheless the New Marauders remained by Miss Sinister&#x27;s side as she allied herself with Havok, Emma Frost and Bastion to release &quot;Mothervine&quot; globally with the intent to make mutantkind the dominant species. Miss Sinister later attempted to recruit the time-displaced Jean Grey to their cause by making sure she would find a necklace which unbeknownst to her, contained the essence of Malice. However, due to Jean&#x27;s strong defenses, Malice could not bring herself to possess Jean, instead she was eventually found by Polaris which she immediately possessed. However, because Polaris had already been possessed by Malice, she was able to free herself from the possession, breaking Malice&#x27;s necklace in the process. Miss Sinister also sent the New Marauders to recruit Xorn to Havok&#x27;s cause, but Jimmy Hudson and Bloodstorm, intervened and rescued him. Shortly afterwards, the New Marauders were sent to attack Magneto, who had threatened Havok&#x27;s plans but the master of magnetism evaded them and escaped using his time platform. Following the capture of the young X-Men, Emma Frost finally rejected Miss Sinister&#x27;s ideal and psychically controlled Mach-II, Armor and Guardian in order to turned them upon their mistress, however, Miss Sinister activated a kill-switch she had implanted in their genetic code, which killed instantly all three.

<text>Santa Cruz das Flores (; ) is a municipality situated in the north half of the island of Flores, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. Situated in the sparsely populated Western Group, the population in 2021 was 2,020 inhabitants in an area that covers approximately , bordering the southern municipality of Lajes das Flores.

==History==
The earliest record of the northern municipality referred to the village of Santa Cruz das Flores, in 1548. Transcribing the works of Father [Gaspar Frutuoso], Francisco Gomes documented the arrival of the crew of the nau &quot;Nossa Senhor da Misericórida&quot;. He included Gaspar Frutuoso&#x27;s 1589 reference, described the growing urban area of Santa Cruz as a &quot;well divided and plane villa&quot; covered in thatched roofs. Ponta Delgada, he continued, was a &quot;parish of 30 neighbours&quot; surrounding its small hermitage (dedicated to Santo Amaro, even as its ecclesiastical patron since the 16th century was the apostle Peter).

In the beginning of the 17th-Century Diogo das Chagas, referred to the villa of Santa Cruz as the &quot;head of the island&quot; and the center of the administration, noting &quot;[the village]...is very well located with the best port on the island...&quot;. He described his hometown as built on &quot;firm foundations&quot;, delimited by its interlocking roads that began at the Santa Cruz sandbar and the other the port of Poças, all in the direction of Monte Calvário (today, Monte das Cruzes). He described &quot;...the first road of the village and from the Porto das Poças another road, which is the last in the village, and where the rest of the roads intersect...&quot;. This year marked the municipal administration of the northern half of the island; part of the administrative regalia, was the obligatory construction of a lighthouse.

A primitive church, dating to the 16th century and constructed in 1627, by vicar Inácio Coelho, who in 1641 also provided land for the founding of the Franciscan Convent of São Boaventura, as well as the bread and wine for religious ceremonies.

By the end of 1693, Friar Agostinho de Mont&#x27;Alverne, referred to 9000 inhabitants, living in 180 homes, primarily in the village of Santa Cruz. These original settlers were Portuguese, primarily from the area of the Alentejo and Minho. It was about this time that the third oldest of the parishes was created by the Diocese in Angra, on 9 July 1693: Nossa Senhora do Pilar, delimited by the ravines of Barrosas (in the north) and Alagoa (in the south). The two localities that formed the parish, Cedros and Ponta Ruiva, de-annexed from the parishes of São Pedro de Ponta Delgada and the Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, in Santa Cruz, included 50 homes and 176 people. With its presbytery and image of it patron saint provided by the Count of Santa Cruz, its primitive parochial church was later expanded in 1719 and reconstructed in 1822.

By 1717, Father António Corderio described a population of &quot;over 200 homes, on a plain surface, well constructed, with four roads that lead to the sea, cut by various lanes.&quot; Many of its roads were marked by iconic buildings, including the hermitage of St. Peter and main parochial church (which continued to be constructed and reconstructed into the 18th century), in addition to the hermitages of São Sebastião, Santa Catarina, and the Franciscan Convent of São Boaventura (founded in 1641 by father Inácio Coelho).

The parochial church of Ponta Delgada resulted from the reconstruction of the old hermitage, around 1763, under the initiative of Father Francisco de Fraga e Almeida. Initially, the parish also included the areas of Ponta and Ponta Ruiva, but which were later deannexed to form the parishes of the Fajãs (in 1676) and Nossa Senhora do Pilar (in 1693), respectively. About the same time, José António de Sousa Bettencourt, a natural and property-owner from the island of Graciosa, began constructing a hermitage in the area of Caveira, that was consecrated on 22 December 1763, to the invocation of the &quot;Sainted Souls of the Flames of Purgatory&quot; (). At the time, the inhabitants (numbering about 100 in 32 homes) were subject to the &quot;spiritual and corporal convenience&quot; of the parish of São Caetano in Lomba, since July 1757. Unfortunately, this parish operated in the neighbouring municipality of Lajes, and the parishioners were required to trek the distance for services between valleys. This continued until 1833 and 1834, when the little settlement of Caveira was transformed into a parish, thereby obtaining the patron of &quot;Benditas Almas&quot; (&quot;Blessed Souls&quot;), from 1954 on the invocation of &quot;Nossa Senhora do Livramento&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Freedom&quot;)).

Santa Cruz, around 1815, had already developed into a beautiful city, all but in name. But, as the old ecclesiastical ouvidor José António Camões observed, its principal roadways (&quot;Rua das Poças&quot;, &quot;Rua do Rego&quot;, &quot;Rua de Santa Catarina&quot;, &quot;Rua do Porto&quot;, &quot;Rua Nova&quot; and &quot;Rua de São Sebastião do Moio&quot;) and various lanes were irregular, as too were its buildings. Of the 429 buildings registered by the local administration, only 113 were covered by standard shingles of the period. Of the 419 people that inhabited the areas of Ribeira dos Barqueiros, Vales, Pampilhal, Fazenda and Além da Ribeira (there were no records for the centre of town), no one person used footwear. Poverty was a general condition, and the Donatários of the island (first the Fonsecas, later the Counts of Santa Cruz and finally Pedro José Caupers) subjugated the populace as serfs. The Crown had bestowed the lands, politico-military institutions and clergy for the islanders, but neglected the socio-political institutions that relegated, as Father Camões described: &quot;...the inhabitants of the island of Flores [as the]...most poor and miserable of the universe (except for the Corvinos).&quot;

The cornerstone of the parochial church of Caveira was placed on 13 June 1870, and its construction was completed on 11 September 1880, with the consecration of the altar.

Since 7 January 1841, the villa of Santa Cruz, was the judicial center for the dual-administration of Flores and Corvo (the Western archipelago); the justice system was handled from Santa Cruz, although a magistrate came from off-island. Santa Cruz grew and quickly surpassed Lajes demographically and in its economic position, finally coopting the politics in the two islands in 1895. On the 18 November of that year, the municipality of Lajes was made redundant, and along with Corvo, it became an integrated municipality from 1895 to about 1898. In 1898, the counsel José Luciano de Castro undertook the restoration of the individual administrative divisions.

Alleging problems with the firmness of its lateral walls, the parochial church of Cedros was demolished in September 1945, and a new temple constructed: it was consecrated on 18 June 1954.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
As part of a volcanic island, the municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores offers several scenic vistas, with extinct volcanic cones and lakes in an area generally rugged. It is a natural garden, whose principal activities includes floral-culture and the ubiquitous Azorean dairy industries. The only significantly level ground is occupied by its primary center, Santa Cruz das Flores (parish), located on the eastern coast and near the municipal border with Lajes das Flores. Apart from a commercial center, it is the home of the island&#x27;s only airport and secondary school.

To the north, along the only roadway, is the hamlet of Fazenda de Santa Cruz, noted for its Forest Reserve (Reserva Florestal da Fazenda de Santa Cruz), artificial lake and the island&#x27;s only electrical station (constructed in 1967). The park is home to a small spawning program for trout, provides sites for picnicking, location of deer pens and an abundance of endemic plant species.

At the end of the Regional Road is the community of Ponta Delgada a coastal community with a line of sight to Corvo, as well as many sheltered coves and bays. The Gruta dos Encharéus (an enormous coastal grotto 50 meters long by 25 wide), the Gruta do Galo, the islets of Maria Vaz, Cartário, Abrões, Muda, Pão de Açúcar and Furado, as well as the plains of Ponta Delgada, Moinho and Vermelha, among others, are natural symbols of the coast of this municipality.

=== Ecoregions/Protected areas ===
The western and interior parts of the municipality are largely vacant of inhabitants and unspoiled by development, partly responsible for the island&#x27;s biodiversity being recognized by UNESCO (May 26, 2000). Many of the islands natural resources are located in this region, which includes Morro Alto (the highest point in the municipality and island at 915 meters) and the following natural sites of community interest:

* Recreational Forest Reserve Luís Paulo Camacho ) 
* Natural Forest Reserve of Caldeira Funda ()
* Natural Forest Reserve of Caldeira Rasa ()
* Natural Forest Reserve of Morro Alto e Pico da Sé ()
In addition to the Forest Reserves, the municipality is bisected by a series of pedestrian hiking trails, that skirt the coastal areas and the interior. These trails, at many levels of endurance, include trips that cover: Ponta Delgada, Cedros, Ponta Ruiva, the village of Santa Cruz, Fazenda, Monte, Vales, Ribeira dos Barqueiros and even the smaller parish of Caveira.

===Climate===
Santa Cruz das Flores has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with very mild, rainy winters and warm to hot summers. It has the highest rainfall of all the Azores’ islands and owing to the influence of the Gulf Stream the mildest winters of any place so far from the equator. However, the warm Gulf Stream waters mean rain falls on two-thirds of all days during the year and humidity averages around 80 percent.

===Human geography===
Situated on the maritime coast, the urbanized area is situated on plateau demarcated by a western cliff and the main airport, and surrounded on its western edge by agricultural fields.

The municipality is administered by four civil parishes () that include:
* Caveira - the smallest parish in size, bordering Lajes das Flores, with less than 100 inhabitants;
* Cedros - the &quot;middle&quot; parish that straddles the river-valleys of Alagoa Bay and historical location of orchards owing to its micro-climate;
* Ponta Delgada - third-largest community on the island, located along the northern coast;
* Santa Cruz das Flores - municipal seat, location of the airport and largest population (less than 2000 inhabitants).

Although the population of the municipality has remained relatively stable, it has seen a slow decrease over the years.

Since 2006, the local municipal government has developed many infrastructures, re-qualified many existing buildings, roads and improved the accessibility of existing localities. This included many improvements and expansion of roadways, provision of electrical, water and sanitary services, as well as the construction of new subdivisions (such as the Loteamento da Terça) and beautification programs.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
* Lighthouse of Ponta do Albernaz (), inaugurated on 28 January 1925 as part of the &quot;Plano Geral de Alumiamento e Balizagem&quot; (&quot;General Illumination and Nautical Signalling Plan&quot;) for the northern coast of Flores, with the intent of providing a beacon for shipping passing through the Flores-Corvo;
* Municipal Library of Santa Cruz das Flores ()
* Museum Pimental de Mesquita ()
* Whaling Factory of Boqueiro ()

===Religious===
* Church of Benditas Almas (), around 1767 the first small church, was constructed under the initiative of José António de Sousa Bettencourt (dedicated to the &quot;Blessed Souls&quot;) on the site of today&#x27;s cemetery, but the current church (of the same invocation) was only founded in 1867;
* Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (), the monolithic/bulky church of the Conception, sited on the primitive location of village temple, was initiated in 1781, but only completed a century later; for grande facade and ornate interior, the Regional Government classified this unique structure in the western group of islands as a &quot;Imóvel de Interesse Público&quot;;
* Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar (), owing to its distance from Santa Cruz, the residents of Cedros solicited the Bishop of Angra, to Cedros de-annexed and its own curia installed. In order to justify this request the residents contributed, with their own funds to construct a church, supported by then-Captain-Donatary, D. Martinho Mascarenhas (6th Count of Santa Cruz), who contributed a retable and donated an image of &quot;Senhora do Pilar&quot;.
* Church of São Pedro (), parochial church dedicated to St. Peter, constructed in 1763, promoted by Father Francisco de Fraga e Almeida, a man of great fortune, old vicar and Ouvidor for the islands of Flores and Corvo. The church was remodeled during the latter part of the 20th century;
* Convent of São Boaventura (), today home to the Museum of Flores, the Franciscan convent was built under the initiative of Inácio Coelho, then vicar of Santa Cruz. It is suggested that this church was originally conceived in fulfillment of a vow following the triumph of Portuguese forces over Spain during the Restoration War.

<text>Lumpy Gravy is a 1968 solo album by Frank Zappa (credited as Francis Vincent Zappa), written by Zappa and performed by a group of session players he dubbed the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus. Zappa conducted the orchestra but did not perform on the album. It is his fourth album overall: his previous releases had been under the name of his group, the Mothers of Invention.

An entirely orchestral recording under the same name was commissioned and briefly released, on August 7, 1967, by Capitol Records in the 4-track Stereo-Pak format only and then withdrawn due to a lawsuit from MGM Records. MGM claimed that the album violated Zappa&#x27;s contract with their subsidiary, Verve Records. In 1968 it was reedited and released by Verve on May 13, 1968. The new album consisted of two musique concrète pieces that combined elements from the original orchestral performance with elements of surf music and spoken word. It was praised for its music and editing.

Produced simultaneously with &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, Zappa saw &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; as the second part of a conceptual continuity that later included his final album, &quot;Civilization Phaze III&quot;.

== Recording ==

Following the release of &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, the debut album of the rock band the Mothers of Invention, Capitol Records A&amp;R representative Nick Venet commissioned an album of orchestral music composed by the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s leader, Frank Zappa, a self-taught composer. Venet spent $40,000 on the album. Because Zappa&#x27;s contract with Verve and MGM Records did not allow for him to perform on albums recorded for any other label, he could not play any instrument on the proposed album, and instead served as the conductor of an orchestra consisting of session musicians hired for the recording. Zappa stated that &quot;my contract [with MGM] did not preclude me from doing that. I wasn&#x27;t signed as a conductor.&quot;

&quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; was conceived as a short oratorio, written in eleven days. Zappa named the group assembled for the sessions the &quot;Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus&quot;.

Percussionist Emil Richards recalled that he did not know who Zappa was and did not take him seriously as the recording sessions began, believing that Zappa was merely the guitarist for a rock band. However, upon meeting them, Zappa handed the musicians the scores for the pieces, which were dense, complex and varied in time signatures. Richards&#x27; close friend, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, was another member of the recording sessions. Tedesco mocked Zappa, believing that Zappa did not know what he was doing. The bassoonist and bass clarinetist hired for the sessions refused to perform their parts, declaring them impossible to play. Zappa responded, &quot;If I play your part, will you at least try it?&quot; Zappa then used his guitar to demonstrate the parts for the musicians, who then agreed to perform their assigned parts. By the end of the recording sessions, Richards and Tedesco became convinced of Zappa&#x27;s talent, and became friends with the composer. Richards later performed on sessions which appeared on Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;Orchestral Favorites&quot;.

== Release, lawsuit and reediting ==
Capitol released the original all-orchestral &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; album on August 7, 1967, only on the 4-track cartridge format, apparently in limited numbers. Capitol also intended to release a single consisting of the pieces &quot;Gypsy Airs&quot; and &quot;Sink Trap&quot; to promote its release. In response to the album&#x27;s release, MGM threatened a lawsuit, claiming that its release violated Zappa&#x27;s contract.

During the litigation, Zappa expanded and significantly edited the album, adding spoken word and musique concrète interludes, as well as some pieces of music from his pre-Mothers archives. The original &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; was not re-released until 2009, with the Zappa Records triple-CD release, &quot;The Lumpy Money Project/Object&quot;.

The dialogue segments were recorded at Apostolic Studios in New York City after Zappa discovered that the strings of the studio&#x27;s grand piano would resonate if a person spoke near those strings. The &quot;piano people&quot; experiment involved Zappa having various speakers improvise dialogue using topics offered by Zappa. Most of the dialogue on the reedited &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, recorded simultaneously with &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, was spoken by a small group which included Motorhead Sherwood, Roy Estrada, Spider Barbour, All-Night John (the manager of the studio) and Louis Cuneo, who was noted for his laugh, which sounded like a &quot;psychotic turkey&quot;. The concept of the reedited album derived from Zappa&#x27;s &quot;big note&quot; theory, which states that the universe consists of a single element, and that atoms are vibrations of that element, a &quot;big note&quot;.

The revised album proved to be very difficult to make, as the orchestral master tapes recovered from Capitol featured many poor splices. The reedited version also incorporated additional musical content not on the original release of the album, including previously recorded surf music and a 1963 Zappa-produced demo recording of a tune that later appeared in a 1967 recording under the title &quot;Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance&quot; on &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;. Some of the editing was done in Zappa&#x27;s living room. On the 1967 and 1968 releases of the album, Zappa was credited as &quot;Francis Vincent Zappa&quot;, as Zappa had believed that this was his real name. He later learned that his birth name was Frank Vincent Zappa, and this mistake was subsequently corrected in reissues of the album.

== Reception and legacy ==
The 1968 &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; album was well received by critics, and Zappa called it one of his favorite albums out of his own work, stating that it contains his favorite music. Barry Miles, writing in &quot;International Times&quot;, described the album as fusing John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Fontana Mix&quot; (1958) and John Carisi&#x27;s &quot;Moon Taj&quot; (1962) with Zappa&#x27;s distinctive style of &quot;lyricism and cynicism&quot;, and praised Zappa&#x27;s editing of the &quot;loaded&quot; conversation snippets, deeming them &quot;masterpieces of editing&quot;. In a mixed review, Jim Miller of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it Zappa&#x27;s &quot;most curious&quot; album to date, finding it to represent the extreme of his &quot;fragmented musical approach&quot;, but believed it to be overall &quot;rather inert&quot; and criticised the spoken sections for seeming forced. However, they deemed it an important album, concluding: &quot;It might be said that Zappa makes mistakes other rock composers would be proud to call their own best music; &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; is an idiosyncratic musical faux pas that is worth listening to for that reason alone.&quot;

Retrospectively, AllMusic writer François Couture wrote, &quot;The starting point of Zappa&#x27;s &#x27;serious music,&#x27; &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; suffers from a lack of coherence, but it remains historically important and contains many conceptual continuity clues for the fan.&quot; David Cavanagh of &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote that the &quot;collage-style concept album&quot; features &quot;some of his most avant-garde music as well as some of his most bizarre encounters with his fellow Mothers.&quot; Ian Stonehouse of &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; wrote that the album shows Zappa at his &quot;most original&quot;, noting its cut-up blend of musique concrète, R&amp;B, jazz and &quot;mumblings from inside a grand piano&quot;, and deemed it a &quot;masterpiece that anticipated sampling technology&quot;. Miles, writing for &quot;The History of Rock&quot;, wrote that the record &quot;owed far more to Varèse and Stravinsky than to rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.&quot;

Edwin Pouncey of &quot;The Wire&quot; writes that the album is &quot;[t]he culmination of Zappa&#x27;s commitment to contemporary classical and electronic music&quot;, and deemed it crucial for combining &quot;classically motivated interludes, electronic abstractions and rambling spoken word compositions within a basic rock structure. Whereas other &#x27;rock stars&#x27; frequently toyed with vague notions of musique concrète and experimental music, Zappa incorporated them into a medium that extended his musical repertoire and pushed the prowess of The Mothers Of Invention to new heights of skill and endurance.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; writer Ryan Reed describes it as an &quot;avant-garde masterpiece&quot; which has become overlooked in Zappa&#x27;s discography for being one of his more unorthodox recordings, &quot;branching from musique concrete to gorgeous jazz-fusion to proto-electronic hysteria to pitch-shifted rock grooves&quot;. They write that it has had &quot;a sizable influence on both rock and avant-garde artists over the years&quot;.

In 1984, the second version of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; was remixed by Zappa, with new overdubs by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman. This third version of the album was not released in full at the time; an excerpt appeared in a &quot;The Old Masters&quot; sampler sent to radio stations. Additional dialogue from the &quot;piano people&quot; sessions was included on Zappa&#x27;s later album &quot;Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention&quot;, and his final album, &quot;Civilization Phaze III&quot; in 1993. In 2009, the box set &quot;Lumpy Money&quot; was released, containing the 1967 and 1984 versions of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, and audio documentary material derived from the sessions that produced the original 1967 orchestral sessions, dialogue which appeared in the 1968 release of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, and the album &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;.

<text>William Wickham PC PC (Ire) (11 November 1761 – 22 October 1840) was a British spymaster and a director of internal security services during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was credited with disrupting radical conspiracies in England but, appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, failed in 1803 to anticipate a republican insurrection in Dublin. He ended his career in government service in 1804, resigning his post in Ireland where, privately, he denounced government policy as unjust and oppressive.

== Early years ==
Born into wealth in Cottingley, Yorkshire, England, he was the eldest son of Henry Wickham, Esq., of Cottingley, Lieutenant-Colonel in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, and a justice of the peace for the West Riding. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of William Lamplugh, vicar of Cottingley. Wickham attended Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a protégé of Cyril Jackson. He took a law degree in Geneva, Switzerland in 1786. He was also called to the bar in England, at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

In 1788 he married Eleonora Madeleine Bertrand (d. 1836), whose father was professor of mathematics in the University of Geneva. They had one son, Henry Lewis Wickham (b. 1789); Henry&#x27;s son, William, was a member of parliament for Petersfield.

==Magistrate==
From 1790 to 1794, Wickham was a commissioner of bankrupts. Following the passing of the Middlesex Justices Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 53), Wickham was appointed in 1793 as one of the new stipendiary magistrates. In this position he began to undertake secret work for the government, at the behest of Lord Grenville, the then Foreign Secretary. This was at a time when the French Revolution was causing great concern to the British political establishment, and powers were given to magistrates under the Aliens Act 1793. 

An early action taken by Wickham in his new post was the infiltration of the radical London Corresponding Society, leading to the arrest and trial for treason of its leaders. Despite the apparent failure of his spies to uncover anything incriminating amidst the society&#x27;s meetings and papers or to entrap the members in sedition, treason, or other crimes, Wickham was made &quot;superintendent of aliens&quot; in 1794 by the then Home Secretary, the Duke of Portland.

==Intelligence activities==
Because of his knowledge of Switzerland, Grenville sent Wickham to that country in 1794 as assistant to the British ambassador. A year later he was named &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; when the ambassador took extended leave, and then appointed ambassador in his own right. His unofficial duties were to liaise with French opponents of the Revolution. By 1795, England was openly combating the French revolutionaries who had usurped and beheaded King Louis XVI and his Queen, Marie Antoinette. Wickham established a spy network in Switzerland, southern Germany and in France and negotiated with French Royalists and others, supporting amongst other initiatives the disastrous rising in la Vendée.

Wickham strengthened the British intelligence system by emphasising the centrality of the intelligence cycle – query, collection, collation, analysis and dissemination – and the need for an all-source centre of intelligence.

The government secretly funded Wickham with a substantial budget for his activities, and he enjoyed considerable freedom with which to operate. A good deal of this was spent in a complex plot to bring French revolutionary general Charles Pichegru over to the ranks of Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, who maintained an army on the Rhine. Wickham advanced £8,000 to feed and supply Pichegru&#x27;s troops; however, Pichegru vacillated and the initiative failed. Wickham also reported on French troop positions, armaments and operations. French spies, however, learned of his network, and France pressured Swiss authorities to expel him.

Wickham resigned, returning to England in 1798, where he resumed, after some internal wrangling, his position as Superintendent of Aliens, and was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. For a year and a half he was &quot;the effective head of the secret service&quot;. In that capacity, in March 1798 he orchestrated the arrests in London of leading radicals in the London Corresponding Society and their United Irish contacts, among them James Coigly who was executed in June for treasonable communication with the French, and Edward Despard destined to follow Coigly to the gallows in 1802.

The following year, 1799, Wickham returned to Europe to Swabia, close to the Swiss border, in 1799 where his averred role was to liaise with the armies of Austria and Russia in Europe, which were supported by Britain against Napoleon. Again he negotiated inconclusively with Pichegru, but his expensive intrigues were rendered useless by Napoleon&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Marengo (June 1800); moreover he was accused in London of misuse of public funds, which brought him close to a nervous breakdown. He returned to London in 1801.

Sheryl Craig suggests that Wickham&#x27;s notoriety in this period inspired Jane Austen to name the duplicitous villain of Pride and Prejudice, George Wickham, after him.

William Wickham advocated preventive policing: using networks of informers to uncover and frustrate seditious conspiracies before they reached fruition. However while he considered such undercover surveillance to be necessary in the national interest, he also believed that the security services should conduct in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. Thus, when peace appeared on the horizon in 1801 he proposed winding back of the wartime intelligence apparatus to a level &quot;which a Free People jealous of its Liberties may be supposed fairly and rightly to entertain.&quot;

==Ireland==
In 1802 Wickham was appointed to the Privy Council and named Chief Secretary for Ireland under Lord Hardwicke.

In July 1803, within days of Wickham having reassured the government in London that, in the wake of the Acts of Union, Ireland was at peace, an accidental explosion at a rebel arms depot in Dublin precipitated a disorderly rising led by Robert Emmet. Wickham was tasked with investigating the conspiracy and with the capture and interrogation of Emmet and his lieutenants.

Emmet was arrested in August, convicted of treason, and executed in September. Before leaving his prison cell for the last time, Emmet wrote to the Chief Secretary giving an account of motives and thanking him for the fair treatment he had received. It was a letter Wickham was later to refer to as his &quot;constant companion&quot;.

In December, Wickham resigned. To a confidant he wrote: &quot;I have been treated unkindly and unhandsomely by a government which I have served faithfully, zealously, and with great affection.&quot; At the same time, he told friends that &quot;no consideration upon earth&quot; could have induced him &quot;to remain after having maturely reflected on the contents’ of Emmet&#x27;s letter&quot;. Emmet had been attempting to save Ireland from &quot;a state of depression and humiliation&quot; and Wickham proposed that had he been an Irishman, he &quot;should most unquestionably have joined him&quot;. (Wickham was also impressed by Emmet&#x27;s lieutenant Nicholas Stafford, who had refused to incriminate his companions: he was, he reported, &quot;the finest looking man&quot; he ever saw).

On the eve of his resignation he gave John Petty, Earl Wycombe, written assurance that he was not under consideration for arrest. This was despite his spymaster, Francis Higgins, insisting that Wycombe had &quot;entered deep into the virus&quot; of Emmet&#x27;s conspiracy&quot;.

On the formation of Grenville&#x27;s ministry in 1806, Wickham was appointed a Lord of the Treasury, but he resigned again from his post the following year. He would not serve in an administration that refused Catholic Emancipation. Wickham never again held government office.

In 1802, he had entered the new United Kingdom Parliament as MP for the Irish borough constituency of Cashel, serving until 1806. Wickham then sat for the English seat of Callington in Cornwall until 1807.

==Family papers==
The Hampshire Record Office holds a number of Wickham&#x27;s papers. The archive relates also to his grandson William Wickham, who was vice-chairman on the first County Council. The archive includes grants of full powers to Wickham in 1799 and 1801; also poll books for the election of members of parliament representing Oxford University in 1801 and 1809, a plan showing the arrangement of wine in the cellars, and papers about Wickham&#x27;s success in growing fig trees, which continue to flourish at his home in Binsted. His other property was Lullebrook Manor at Cookham in Berkshire.

== Poldark ==
As the historical spy-master William Wickham appeared in the Poldark novels of Winston Graham, and in the 2015 BBC historical drama series of the same name. His character was played by Anthony Calf.

<text>In computing, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a point-to-point serial protocol that moves data to and from computer-storage devices such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives and tape drives. SAS replaces the older Parallel SCSI (Parallel Small Computer System Interface, usually pronounced &quot;scuzzy&quot; ) bus technology that first appeared in the mid-1980s. SAS, like its predecessor, uses the standard SCSI command set. SAS offers optional compatibility with Serial ATA (SATA), versions 2 and later. This allows the connection of SATA drives to most SAS backplanes or controllers. The reverse, connecting SAS drives to SATA backplanes, is not possible.

The T10 technical committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) develops and maintains the SAS protocol; the SCSI Trade Association (SCSITA) promotes the technology.

==Introduction==
A typical Serial Attached SCSI system consists of the following basic components:

# An &quot;initiator&quot;: a device that originates device-service and task-management requests for processing by a target device and receives responses for the same requests from other target devices. Initiators may be provided as an on-board component on the motherboard (as is the case with many server-oriented motherboards) or as an add-on host bus adapter.
# A &quot;target&quot;: a device containing logical units and target ports that receives device service and task management requests for processing and sends responses for the same requests to initiator devices. A target device could be a hard disk drive or a disk array system.
# A &quot;service delivery subsystem&quot;: the part of an I/O system that transmits information between an initiator and a target. Typically cables connecting an initiator and target with or without expanders and backplanes constitute a service delivery subsystem.
# &quot;Expanders&quot;: devices that form part of a service delivery subsystem and facilitate communication between SAS devices. Expanders facilitate the connection of multiple SAS End devices to a single initiator port.

==History==
* SAS-1: 3.0 Gbit/s, introduced in 2004
* SAS-2: 6.0 Gbit/s, available since February 2009
* SAS-3: 12.0 Gbit/s, available since March 2013
* SAS-4: 22.5 Gbit/s called &quot;24G&quot;, standard completed in 2017
* SAS-5: 45 Gbit/s development started 2018

==Identification and addressing==
A &quot;SAS Domain&quot; is the SAS version of a SCSI domain—it consists of a set of SAS devices that communicate with one another by means of a service delivery subsystem. Each SAS port in a SAS domain has a SCSI port identifier that identifies the port uniquely within the SAS domain, the World Wide Name. It is assigned by the device manufacturer, like an Ethernet device&#x27;s MAC address, and is typically worldwide unique as well. SAS devices use these port identifiers to address communications to each other.

In addition, every SAS device has a SCSI device name, which identifies the SAS device uniquely in the world. One does not often see these device names because the port identifiers tend to identify the device sufficiently.

For comparison, in parallel SCSI, the SCSI ID is the port identifier and device name. In Fibre Channel, the port identifier is a WWPN and the device name is a WWNN.

In SAS, both SCSI port identifiers and SCSI device names take the form of a &quot;SAS address&quot;, which is a 64 bit value, normally in the NAA IEEE Registered format. People sometimes refer to a SCSI port identifier as &quot;the&quot; SAS address of a device, out of confusion. People sometimes call a SAS address a World Wide Name or WWN, because it is essentially the same thing as a WWN in Fibre Channel. For a SAS expander device, the SCSI port identifier and SCSI device name are the same SAS address.

== Comparison with parallel SCSI ==
* The SAS &quot;bus&quot; operates point-to-point while the SCSI bus is multidrop. Each SAS device is connected by a dedicated link to the initiator, unless an expander is used. If one initiator is connected to one target, there is no opportunity for contention; with parallel SCSI, even this situation could cause contention.
* SAS has no termination issues and does not require terminator packs like parallel SCSI.
* SAS eliminates clock skew.
* SAS allows up to 65,535 devices through the use of expanders, while Parallel SCSI has a limit of 8 or 16 devices on a single channel.
* SAS allows a higher transfer speed (SAS-1, SAS-2, SAS-3, and SAS-4 supports data bandwidth of 3, 6, 12, and 24 Gbits/sec, respectively) than most parallel SCSI standards. SAS achieves these speeds on each initiator-target connection, hence getting higher throughput, whereas parallel SCSI shares the speed across the entire multidrop bus.
* SAS devices feature dual ports, allowing for redundant backplanes or multipath I/O; this feature is usually referred to as the &quot;dual-domain SAS&quot;.
* SAS controllers may connect to SATA devices, either directly connected using native SATA protocol or through SAS expanders using Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol (STP).
* Both SAS and parallel SCSI use the SCSI command set.

== Comparison with SATA ==
There is little physical difference between SAS and SATA.

* SAS protocol provides for multiple initiators in a SAS domain, while SATA has no analogous provision.
* Most SAS drives provide tagged command queuing, while most newer SATA drives provide native command queuing.
* SATA uses a command set that is based on the parallel ATA command set and then extended beyond that set to include features like native command queuing, hot-plugging, and TRIM. SAS uses the SCSI command set, which includes a wider range of features like error recovery, reservations and block reclamation. Basic ATA has commands only for direct-access storage. However SCSI commands may be tunneled through ATAPI for devices such as CD/DVD drives.
* SAS hardware allows multipath I/O to devices while SATA (prior to SATA 2.0) does not. Per specification, SATA 2.0 makes use of port multipliers to achieve port expansion, and some port multiplier manufacturers have implemented multipath I/O using port multiplier hardware.
* SATA is marketed as a general-purpose successor to parallel ATA and common in the consumer market, whereas the more-expensive SAS targets critical server applications.
* SAS error-recovery and error-reporting uses SCSI commands, which have more functionality than the ATA SMART commands used by SATA drives.
* SAS uses higher signaling voltages (800–1,600 mV for transmit, and 275–1,600 mV for receive) than SATA (400–600 mV for transmit, and 325–600 mV for receive). The higher voltage offers (among other features) the ability to use SAS in server backplanes.
* Because of its higher signaling voltages, SAS can use cables up to long, whereas SATA has a cable-length limit of or for eSATA.
* SAS is full duplex, whereas SATA is half duplex. The SAS transport layer can transmit data at the full speed of the link in both directions at once, so a SCSI command executing over the link can transfer data to and from the device simultaneously. However, because SCSI commands that can do that are rare, and a SAS link must be dedicated to an individual command at a time, this is generally not an advantage with a single device.

==Characteristics==

===Technical details===
The Serial Attached SCSI standard defines several layers (in order from highest to lowest): application, transport, port, link, PHY and physical. Serial Attached SCSI comprises three transport protocols:

* Serial SCSI Protocol (SSP) for command-level communication with SCSI devices.
* Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol (STP) for command-level communication with SATA devices.
* Serial Management Protocol (SMP) for managing the SAS fabric.

For the Link and PHY layers, SAS defines its own unique protocol.

At the physical layer, the SAS standard defines connectors and voltage levels. The physical characteristics of the SAS wiring and signaling are compatible with and have loosely tracked that of SATA up to the 6 Gbit/s rate, although SAS defines more rigorous physical signaling specifications as well as a wider allowable differential voltage swing intended to allow longer cabling. While SAS-1.0 and SAS-1.1 adopted the physical signaling characteristics of SATA at the 3 Gbit/s rate with 8b/10b encoding, SAS-2.0 development of a 6 Gbit/s physical rate led the development of an equivalent SATA speed. In 2013, 12 Gbit/s followed in the SAS-3 specification. SAS-4 is slated to introduce 22.5 Gbit/s signaling with a more efficient 128b/150b encoding scheme to realize a usable data rate of 2,400 MB/s while retaining compatibility with 6 and 12 Gbit/s.

Additionally, SCSI Express takes advantage of the PCI Express infrastructure to directly connect SCSI devices over a more universal interface.

===Architecture===
SAS architecture consists of six layers:
* Physical layer:
** defines electrical and physical characteristics
** differential signaling transmission
** Multiple connector types:
*** SFF-8482 – SATA compatible
*** Internal four-lane connectors: SFF-8484, SFF-8087, SFF-8643
*** External four-lane connectors: SFF-8470, SFF-8088, SFF-8644
* PHY Layer:
** 8b/10b data encoding (3, 6, and 12 Gbit/s)
** 128b/150b SPL packet encoding (22.5 Gbit/s) (2 bit header, 128 bit payload, 20 bit Reed-Solomon forward error correction)
** Link initialization, speed negotiation and reset sequences
** Link capabilities negotiation (SAS-2 onwards)
* Link layer:
** Insertion and deletion of primitives for clock-speed disparity matching
** Primitive encoding
** Data scrambling for reduced EMI
** Establish and tear down native connections between SAS targets and initiators
** Establish and tear down tunneled connections between SAS initiators and SATA targets connected to SAS expanders
** Power management (proposed for SAS-2.1)
* Port layer:
** Combining multiple PHYs with the same addresses into wide ports
* Transport layer:
** Contains three transport protocols:
*** Serial SCSI Protocol (SSP): for command-level communication with SCSI devices
*** Serial ATA Tunneled Protocol (STP): for command-level communication with SATA devices
*** Serial Management Protocol (SMP): for managing the SAS fabric
* Application layer

===Topology===
An initiator may connect directly to a target via one or more PHYs (such a connection is called a port whether it uses one or more PHYs, although the term &quot;wide port&quot; is sometimes used for a multi-PHY connection).

===SAS expanders===
The components known as &quot;Serial Attached SCSI Expanders&quot; (SAS Expanders) facilitate communication between large numbers of SAS devices. Expanders contain two or more external expander-ports. Each expander device contains at least one SAS Management Protocol target port for management and may contain SAS devices itself. For example, an expander may include a Serial SCSI Protocol target port for access to a peripheral device. An expander is &quot;not necessary&quot; to interface a SAS initiator and target but allows a single initiator to communicate with more SAS/SATA targets. A useful analogy: one can regard an expander as akin to a network switch in a network, which connects multiple systems using a single switch port.

SAS 1 defined two types of expander; however, the SAS-2.0 standard has dropped the distinction between the two, as it created unnecessary topological limitations with no realized benefit:
* An &quot;edge expander&quot; allows for communication with up to 255 SAS addresses, allowing the SAS initiator to communicate with these additional devices. Edge expanders can do direct table routing and subtractive routing. (For a brief discussion of these routing mechanisms, see below). Without a fanout expander, you can use at most two edge expanders in a delivery subsystem (because you connect the subtractive routing port of those edge expanders together, and you can not connect any more expanders). Fanout expanders solve this bottleneck.
* A &quot;fanout expander&quot; can connect up to 255 sets of edge expanders, known as an &quot;edge expander device set&quot;, letting even more SAS devices be addressed. The subtractive routing port of each edge expanders connects to the phys of fanout expander. A fanout expander cannot do subtractive routing, it can only forward subtractive routing requests to the connected edge expanders.

Direct routing allows a device to identify devices directly connected to it. Table routing identifies devices connected to the expanders connected to a device&#x27;s own PHY. Subtractive routing is used when you are not able to find the devices in the sub-branch you belong to. This passes the request to a different branch altogether.

Expanders exist to allow more complex interconnect topologies. Expanders assist in link-switching (as opposed to packet-switching) end-devices (initiators or targets). They may locate an end-device either directly (when the end-device is connected to it), via a routing table (a mapping of end-device IDs and the expander the link should be switched to downstream to route towards that ID), or when those methods fail, via subtractive routing: the link is routed to a single expander connected to a subtractive routing port. If there is no expander connected to a subtractive port, the end-device cannot be reached.

Expanders with no PHYs configured as subtractive act as fanout expanders and can connect to any number of other expanders. Expanders with subtractive PHYs may only connect to two other expanders at a maximum, and in that case they must connect to one expander via a subtractive port and the other via a non-subtractive port.

SAS-1.1 topologies built with expanders generally contain one root node in a SAS domain with the one exception case being topologies that contain two expanders connected via a subtractive-to-subtractive port. If it exists, the root node is the expander, which is not connected to another expander via a subtractive port. Therefore, if a fanout expander exists in the configuration, it must be the domain&#x27;s root node. The root node contains routes for all end devices connected to the domain. Note that with the advent in SAS-2.0 of table-to-table routing and new rules for end-to-end zoning, more complex topologies built upon SAS-2.0 rules do not contain a single root node.

===Connectors===
SAS connectors are much smaller than traditional parallel SCSI connectors. Commonly, SAS-3 provides for point data transfer speeds up to 12 Gbit/s. Currently, SAS-4 is available with up to 24 Gbps; with SAS-5 under development, according to T10.

The physical SAS connector comes in several different variants:

== Nearline SAS ==
&quot;Nearline SAS&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;NL-SAS&quot;, and sometimes called &quot;midline SAS&quot;) drives have a SAS interface, but head, media, and rotational speed of traditional enterprise-class SATA drives, so they cost less than other SAS drives. When compared to SATA, NL-SAS drives have the following benefits:
* Dual ports allowing redundant paths
* Ability to connect a device to multiple computers
* Full SCSI command set
* No need for using Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol (STP), which is necessary for SATA HDDs to be connected to a SAS HBA.
* No need for SATA interposer cards, which are needed for pseudo–dual-port high availability of SATA HDDs.
* Larger depth of command queues

<text>George Bradshaw (29 July 1800 – 6 September 1853) was an English cartographer, printer and publisher. He developed Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide, a widely sold series of combined railway guides and timetables.

==Biography==
Bradshaw was born at Windsor Bridge, Pendleton, in Salford, Lancashire. On leaving school he was apprenticed to an engraver named Beale in Manchester, and in 1820 he set up his own engraving business in Belfast, returning to Manchester in 1822 to set up as an engraver and printer, principally of maps.

He was a religious man. Although his parents were not exceptionally wealthy, when he was young they enabled him to take lessons from a minister devoted to the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. He joined the Society of Friends (the Quakers) and gave a considerable part of his time to philanthropic work. He worked a great deal with radical reformers such as Richard Cobden in organising peace conferences and in setting up schools and soup kitchens for the poor of Manchester.

It is his belief as a Quaker that is quoted as causing the early editions of Bradshaw&#x27;s guides to have avoided using the names of months based upon Roman deities which was seen as &quot;pagan&quot; usage. Quaker usage was, and sometimes still is, &quot;First month&quot; for January, &quot;Second month&quot; for February and so on. Days of the week were &quot;First day&quot; for Sunday and so on.

In 1841, he founded a high-quality weekly magazine, edited by George Falkner, called &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s Manchester Journal&quot;, described as &quot;a 16-page miscellany of art, science and literature, to sell at the cheap price of a penny-halfpenny a week. ... After the first six months, it was renamed &quot;Bradshaw’s Journal: A Miscellany of Literature, Science and Art&quot;, and the place of publication moved to London, where the title was taken on by William Strange&quot;, but the journal survived only until 1843.

He married Martha Derbyshire on 15 May 1839 and they had six children. While touring Norway in 1853, he contracted cholera and died in Kristiana (now Oslo) on 6 September, a mere 8 hours after first showing symptoms of the disease. As a local law prohibited the return of his body to England, he was interred in the Gamlebyen cemetery, about a mile from Oslo Cathedral. His gravestone is on the left by the gate near Oslo hospital.

The George Bradshaw room at Friends House, London, UK is named after him.

==Bradshaw&#x27;s railway guides==

Bradshaw&#x27;s was a series of railway timetables and travel guide books published by W. J. Adams of London. George Bradshaw initiated the series in 1839. The &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s&quot; range of titles continued after his death in 1853 until 1961.

==In popular media==
Former British politician Michael Portillo used a copy of what was described as a Bradshaw&#x27;s guide (the 1863 edition of &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s Descriptive Railway Hand-Book of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;) for &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot;, a BBC Two television series in which he travelled across Britain, visiting recommended points of interest noted in Bradshaw&#x27;s guide book, and where possible staying in recommended hotels.

The first series was broadcast in early 2010, and the series has returned annually. The success of the series sparked a new interest in the guides and facsimile copies of the 1863 edition became an unexpected best seller in the UK in 2011. In the 14th episode of series 2, &quot;Batley to Sheffield&quot;, Portillo met a great-great-granddaughter of George Bradshaw, who showed him part of the family archive.

At the end of 2012, a new series, &quot;Great Continental Railway Journeys&quot;, was broadcast with Portillo using the 1913 edition of &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s Continental Railway Guide&quot; to make journeys through various European countries and territories, prompting two publishers to produce facsimiles of the handbook. A second series was broadcast in 2013. Further series covered Asia, Australia and India.

<doc id="1143139" wikidata="Q770194" url="?curid=1143139" title="Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit">
<text>Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit (or Ankhesenpaaten-ta-sherit, “Ankhesenpaaten the Younger”) was an ancient Egyptian princess of the 18th Dynasty.
Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit are two princesses who appear in scenes dating to the later part of the reign of Akhenaten. The titles of at least one of the princess is of the form &quot;[...-ta]sherit, born of [...], born of the King&#x27;s Great Wife [...]. The inscription is damaged and the name of the mother and grandmother of the princesses has not been preserved. Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit has been known to archaeologists since 1938, when a talatat block with her picture and name was found in Hermopolis.

Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit&#x27;s fate is uncertain. The mention of the god Aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of Akhenaten, since his successors reverted his religious reforms, and reverted to the worship of Egypt&#x27;s traditional gods. The name Aten was dropped from popular use during this time.

==Proposed parents==
Several different sets of parents have been proposed for Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit (as well as Meritaten Tasherit).

===Ankhesenpaaten and Akhenaten===
She is most commonly held to have been the daughter of Ankhesenpaaten (a daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten) and Akhenaten himself. The title of the princess is thought to have been &quot;Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit, born of Ankhesenpaaten, born of the King&#x27;s Great Wife Nefertiti&quot;. If we assume that Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit was the daughter of Ankhesenpaaten and Akhenaten, she must have been born towards the very end of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign. Since Ankhesenpaaten was born around the 5th year of her father&#x27;s reign, the earliest year she could have had a child was around Year 16 of his reign.

===Kiya and Akhenaten===
Since both Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten&#x27;s second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya&#x27;s daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye&#x27;s child.

===Meritaten and Smenkhare===
Dodson proposed Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit was a daughter of the young royal couple Meritaten and Smenkhare. The young princess would have been named after Meritaten&#x27;s sister.

<text>The Lichfield Canal Aqueduct is a potentially navigable aqueduct over the M6 Toll Motorway, just to the west of Lichfield and north of Birmingham, England. The aqueduct is un-watered; it was constructed at the same time as the motorway in anticipation of the restoration of the Lichfield Canal.

== History ==
The Lichfield Canal (originally part of the Wyrley and Essington Canal) is currently being restored. Restoration was threatened by the construction of the M6 Toll motorway around the north of Birmingham, which cut across the canal&#x27;s route. The cost of construction was shared, with Midland Expressway (the proprietors of the motorway) funding the foundations and the Lichfield &amp; Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust fundraising to finance the superstructure. The aqueduct was installed on 15 and 16 August 2003.

In 2014/2015, Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust received a Social Investment Business (SIB) grant of £336,000 which enabled the Trust to buy land on either side of the aqueduct and carry out the necessary work to rebuild the canal and bring the aqueduct into use.

In April 2015, Midland Expressway Limited donated £50,000 to Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust to honour an undertaking they made when the M6 Toll Motorway was built. The donation is a &quot;substantial contribution&quot; towards the cost of reinstating the Crane Brook Culvert, which was removed when the motorway was built.

<text>The Dixie Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game held New Year&#x27;s Day at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. The game was only held twice, following the 1947 and 1948 seasons, after which it was discontinued.

Both games featured teams from the Southern Conference and the Southwest Conference (SWC), with the SWC representative winning both.

==Game results==
==Game summaries==

===1948 Dixie Bowl===
Arkansas and No. 14 William &amp; Mary squared off in the inaugural Dixie Bowl on January 1, 1948. The game was played in front of 22,000 at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. Arkansas took a 14–13 lead into halftime. The Tribe scored six in the third quarter to take a 19–14 lead. Arkansas would score the game-winning touchdown on a 7-yard run to win the game 21–19.

===1949 Dixie Bowl===
The second (and final) Dixie Bowl was between the Baylor Bears and the No. 20 Wake Forest Demon Deacons in front of 20,000 in Birmingham. Baylor opened the scoring in the first quarter with a 1-yard run, but missed the extra point attempt, giving them a 6–0 lead. A 1-yard run and a 12-yard pass in the second quarter made it 20–0 at halftime. Baylor&#x27;s defense allowed one touchdown in the third quarter to win the game 20–7. The game was a bit lopsided despite Wake Forest winning the yardage battle 277–212.

<text>Laurie J. Scott (born 1962) is a Canadian politician who served as Ontario Minister of Infrastructure from 2019 to 2021 and Minister of Labour from 2018 to 2019 in the Doug Ford cabinet. She is a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the riding of Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock since 2018.

==Background==
Scott was born and raised in the village of Kinmount, Ontario, now part of the city of Kawartha Lakes. Her father, the late Bill Scott, was a federal Progressive Conservative MP from 1965 to 1993. She attended Loyalist College in Belleville where she obtained a degree in nursing. She worked as a Registered Nurse at the Ross Memorial Hospital and the Toronto General Hospital.

==Politics==
In the Canadian general election of 2000, she ran in Haliburton—Victoria—Brock for the federal Progressive Conservative party, but finished behind Liberal John O&#x27;Reilly and Canadian Alliance candidate Pat Dunn in a close, three-way race. From 2000 to 2003, she worked as an assistant to Progressive Conservative Senator Consiglio Di Nino.

Scott was elected to the Ontario Legislature in the 2003 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Jason Ward in the riding of Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock by over 7,000 votes. Scott was appointed opposition critic for training, colleges and universities.

In the 2007 provincial election, Scott ran against Rick Johnson of the Ontario Liberal Party, and Joan Corrigan of the Ontario NDP. She defeated the Liberal candidate by almost 10,000 votes with 49.9% of the total vote. She then served as the official opposition critic for research and innovation and health promotion.

On January 8, 2009, it was announced that Scott would resign as MPP to allow PC leader John Tory to seek a seat in the legislature. However, Tory was defeated by Johnson in the by-election that followed. Scott subsequently served as chair of the Ontario PC party&#x27;s election preparedness committee until the 2011 election.

In the 2011 election, in a rematch with Johnson, Scott regained her seat defeating Johnson by about 6,000 votes. She was re-elected in the 2014 election defeating Johnson again by about 3,000 votes. She then served as the Official Opposition Critic for Community Safety and Women&#x27;s Issues until 2018.

In the 2018 Ontario provincial election, Laurie Scott was re-elected for a fifth-term as the MPP for Haliburton-Kawartha Lakes-Brock. She received 56.7% of the vote and won with a margin of victory of more than 17 000 votes over the second-place NDP candidate Zac Miller. When the PCs returned to government following the 2018 general election, Scott was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Labour by Premier Doug Ford. After a cabinet shuffle in 2020, she was demoted to Minister of Infrastructure, a portfolio she held until June 18, 2021. Since June 18, 2021, Scott holds no portfolio in the Ford cabinet and is currently a backbencher.

In the 2022 provincial general election, Scott won re-election in Haliburton-Kawartha-Lakes-Brock. She received 25,656 votes. NDP candidate Barbara Doyle received 7,677 votes and Liberal Don McBey 6,608.

She is a passionate advocate for victims of human sex trafficking and was recognized with the BOOST Champion for Children Award in 2017 for her work.

<text>Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets is the fourth album by the Mothers of Invention, and fifth overall by Frank Zappa, released under the alias Ruben and the Jets. Released on December 2, 1968 on Bizarre and Verve Records with distribution by MGM Records, it is a concept album, influenced by 1950s doo-wop and rock and roll. The album&#x27;s concept deals with a fictitious Chicano doo-wop band called Ruben &amp; the Jets, represented by the cover illustration by Cal Schenkel, which depicts the Mothers of Invention as anthropomorphic dogs. It was conceived as part of a project called &quot;No Commercial Potential&quot;, which produced three other albums: &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; and &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;.

The album and its singles received some radio success, due to its doo-wop sound. Subsequently, the name Ruben and the Jets continued with a different lineup, led by musician Rubén Guevara Jr., who recorded the albums &quot;For Real!&quot; (1973) and &quot;Con Safos&quot; (1974). Zappa produced the former.

== Background ==

During a previous recording session, engineer Richard Kunc and the Mothers of Invention discussed their high school days and love for doo-wop songs. Ray Collins and some of the other members of the band started singing and performing the songs, and Zappa suggested that they record an album of doo-wop music. Zappa described the album as an homage to the 1950s vocal music that he was &quot;crazy&quot; about. Collins later left the Mothers of Invention, and Zappa began working on a project entitled &quot;No Commercial Potential&quot;, which included sessions that produced &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;, as well as &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, a revised version of &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;.
After the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s contract with MGM and Verve Records expired, Zappa and Herb Cohen negotiated to form Bizarre Productions, with Verve releasing three Bizarre releases with distribution by MGM: a new Mothers of Invention album, &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;, the compilation &quot;Mothermania&quot;, and an album by Sandy Hurvitz, &quot;Sandy&#x27;s Album is Here at Last&quot;.

Zappa stated, regarding the releases &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot; and &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s all one album. All the material in the albums is organically related and if I had all the master tapes and I could take a razor blade and cut them apart and put it together again in a different order it still would make one piece of music you can listen to. Then I could take that razor blade and cut it apart and reassemble it a different way, and it still would make sense. I could do this twenty ways. The material is definitely related.&quot;

== Recording ==

Ray Collins rejoined the Mothers of Invention for the doo-wop recording sessions of &quot;No Commercial Potential&quot;, as his high falsetto was suited for the recordings. According to Collins, &quot;I brought the style of being raised in Pomona, California, being raised on the Four Aces, the Four Freshmen, Frankie Laine, Frank Sinatra and Jesse Baldwin. The early influences of R&amp;B came into the Southern California area when I was probably in the tenth grade in high school. And I remember Peter Potter&#x27;s show, and I think I recall the first R&amp;B tune on there was &#x27;Oop-Shoop&#x27;. Frank actually had more influences from the &#x27;real blues&#x27;, you know, like Muddy Waters, those kind of people. But I wasn&#x27;t into that in my early life. I was more of the pop culture, pop radio things, and it&#x27;s always been more of a favourite of mine than the early blues stuff - even though I love John Lee Hooker and all those people.&quot;

According to Bunk Gardner, &quot;&quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot; was an easy album to record. We were recording it at the same time as &quot;Uncle Meat&quot; because the songs were easy and very simple and didn&#x27;t require a lot of time for arrangements and technical overdubbing. It was the beginning of the end for Ray Collins because all the new material Frank was writing was a little too far out and away from Ray&#x27;s roots - which was &quot;Ruben&quot;-era material. Motorhead too was in his glory during the recording of this album. He loved &quot;Ruben&quot; and that was really his kind of music to get nostalgic over - on stage and doing the dance steps and playing that music [...] I really enjoyed playing a solo on Ray&#x27;s tune &#x27;Anything&#x27;. I remember Frank, Ray and Roy standing in the control booth while I recorded my solo. Frank was telling me after the first take to keep it simple. So I nailed it on the second take and everyone was happy!&quot;

The doo-wop recordings were reconstituted as the concept album &quot;Cruising with Ruben and the Jets&quot;; the album included four rerecordings of songs that were on the Mothers&#x27; first album &quot;Freak Out!&quot;: &quot;How Could I Be Such a Fool&quot;; &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Try to Call Me&quot;; &quot;Anyway the Wind Blows&quot;; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Satisfied&quot;. Their arrangements were altered to fit within the album&#x27;s concept.

=== Concept ===

Within the concept of the album, Ruben Sano was the leader of the fictitious Chicano band &quot;the Jets&quot;. The back cover depicted Ruben with an early high school photograph of Zappa. According to artist Cal Schenkel, &quot;I started working on the story of Ruben and the Jets that is connected with the Uncle Meat story, which is this old guy turns this teenage band into these dog snout people [...] We started that before it actually became Ruben and the Jets. That came out of my love for comics and that style, the anthropomorphic animals, but also it was part of a running story line.&quot;

Zappa stated regarding the album&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;I detest &#x27;love lyrics&#x27;.&quot; He intentionally wrote lyrics he described as &quot;sub-Mongoloid&quot; to satirize the genre. The music of &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot; was the most straightforward genre work the Mothers of Invention had performed yet, attempting to faithfully reproduce the sound of 1950s doo-wop and rock and roll. However, the arrangements included quotes from Igor Stravinsky pieces and unusual chord changes and tempos.

== Release and legacy ==

The album was popular with radio stations, as they believed it to be an unearthed doo-wop album by an unknown band called Ruben &amp; the Jets. A single was issued (&quot;Deseri&quot; b/w a remixed version of &quot;Jelly Roll Gum Drop&quot;) credited to &quot;Ruben and the Jets&quot;, with no mention of the Mothers of Invention; according to Zappa, later pressings, which credited the Mothers of Invention, did not receive as much airplay as the original &quot;Ruben&quot; pressings. The album&#x27;s cover has a word balloon stating &quot;Is this the Mothers of Invention recording under a different name in a last ditch attempt to get their cruddy music on the radio?&quot; Zappa later dismissed claims that he had &quot;fooled people&quot; with this album as &quot;nonsense&quot;.

Subsequently, Zappa stated that the Mothers of Invention would record a second doo-wop album under the alias Ruben &amp; the Jets. Later, the band Ruben and the Jets continued with a different lineup, led by musician Rubén Guevara Jr., who recorded the albums &quot;For Real!&quot; (1973) and &quot;Con Safos&quot; (1974). Zappa produced the former.

=== Reissues ===
In 1983, Zappa prepared a remix of &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot; for its compact disc reissue the next year, as well as the vinyl box set &quot;The Old Masters I&quot;. The remix featured new rhythm tracks recorded in July 1983 by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman, much as the CD remix of &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; had featured. Zappa stated &quot;The master tapes for &quot;Ruben and the Jets&quot; were in better shape, but since I liked the results on &quot;We&#x27;re Only in it For the Money&quot;, I decided to do it on &quot;Ruben&quot; too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself.&quot;

After the remixing was announced, a $13 million lawsuit was filed against Zappa by Jimmy Carl Black, Bunk Gardner and Don Preston, who were later joined by Ray Collins, Art Tripp and Motorhead Sherwood, increasing the claim to $16.4 million, stating that they had received no royalties from Zappa since 1969.

In 2009, the original mix of the album was released as part of a compilation entitled &quot;Greasy Love Songs&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s François Couture gave the album&#x27;s 1984 remix 3 out of 5 stars. Another writer for the site, Sean Westergaard, gave &quot;Greasy Love Songs&quot; 4 out of 5 stars.

<text>A launch escape system (LES) or launch abort system (LAS) is a crew-safety system connected to a space capsule. It is used in the event of a critical emergency to quickly separate the capsule from its launch vehicle in case of an emergency requiring the abort of the launch, such as an impending explosion. The LES is typically controlled by a combination of automatic rocket failure detection, and a manual activation for the crew commander&#x27;s use. The LES may be used while the launch vehicle is on the launch pad, or during its ascent. Such systems are usually of three types:

*A solid-fueled rocket, mounted above the capsule on a tower, which delivers a relatively large thrust for a brief period of time to send the capsule a safe distance away from the launch vehicle, at which point the capsule&#x27;s parachute recovery system can be used for a safe landing on ground or water. The escape tower and rocket are jettisoned from the space vehicle in a normal flight at the point where it is either no longer needed, or cannot be effectively used to abort the flight. These have been used on the Mercury, Apollo, Soyuz, and Shenzhou capsules.
*The crew are seated in seats that eject themselves (ejection seats) as used in military aircraft; each crew member returns to Earth with an individual parachute. Such systems are effective only in a limited range of altitudes and speeds. These have been used on the Vostok and Gemini capsules, and Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; during its testing phase.
*Thrusters integrated in the capsule or its detachable service module having the same function as an escape tower, as in the case of Crew Dragon, Starliner and New Shepard.

==History==
The idea of using a rocket to remove the capsule from a space vehicle was developed by Maxime Faget in 1958. The system, using the tower on the top of the space capsule to house rockets, was first used on a test of the Project Mercury capsule in March 1959. Historically, LES were used on American Mercury and Apollo spacecraft. Both designs used a solid-fuel rocket motor. The Mercury LES was built by the Grand Central Rocket Company in Redlands, California (which later became the Lockheed Propulsion Company). Apollo used a design that had many similarities to the Mercury system. LES continue to be used on the Russian Soyuz and Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. The SpaceX Dragon 2 uses a hypergolic liquid-fueled launch abort system integrated to the capsule and the Boeing Starliner uses abort thrusters in its service module.

== Related systems ==

The Soviet Vostok and American Gemini spacecraft both made use of ejection seats. The European Space Agency&#x27;s Hermes and the Soviet &quot;Buran&quot;-class spaceplanes would also have made use of them if they had ever flown with crews. As shown by Soyuz T-10a, a LES must be able to carry a crew compartment from the launch pad to a height sufficient for its parachutes to open. Consequently, they must make use of large, powerful (and heavy) solid rockets. The Soyuz launch escape system is called or &quot;SAS&quot;, from the Russian/transliterated Russian or , meaning emergency rescue system.

The Soviet Proton launcher has flown dozens of times with an escape tower, under the Zond program and the TKS program. All of its flights were uncrewed.

The Space Shuttle was fitted with ejection seats for the two pilots in the initial test flights, but these were removed once the vehicle was deemed operational and carried additional crew members, which could not be provided with escape hatches. Following the 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, all surviving orbiters were fitted to allow for crew evacuation through the main ingress/egress hatch (using a specially developed parachute system that could be worn over a spacesuit), although only when the shuttle was in a controlled glide.
The Orion spacecraft, which was developed to follow the Space Shuttle program, uses a Mercury and Apollo-style escape rocket system, while an alternative system, called the Max Launch Abort System (MLAS), was investigated and would have used existing solid-rocket motors integrated into the bullet-shaped protective launch shroud.

Under NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program Blue Origin was awarded $3.7 million for development of an innovative &#x27;pusher&#x27; LAS. It is used on the New Shepard Crew Capsule. 

Also under NASA&#x27;s CCDev program, SpaceX was awarded $75 million for the development of their own version of a &quot;pusher&quot; LAS. Their Dragon 2 spacecraft uses its SuperDraco engines during a launch abort scenario. Although often referred to as a &quot;pusher&quot; arrangement since it lacks a tower, the Dragon 2 LAS removes both the capsule and its trunk together from the launch vehicle. The system is designed to abort with the SuperDraco engines at the top of the abort stack as occurs with a more traditional tractor LAS. The concept was first tested in a pad abort test conducted at SLC-40, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, on May 6, 2015. SpaceX tested the system on January 19, 2020, during a full-scale simulation of a Falcon 9 rocket malfunction at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, where it has later launched crews to the International Space Station.

The second crewed spacecraft selected by NASA for its CCDev program was Boeing&#x27;s CST-100 Starliner, which, like SpaceX&#x27;s Dragon 2 spacecraft, uses a &quot;pusher&quot; launch escape system, consisting of four launch abort engines mounted on the service module that can propel the spacecraft away from its Atlas V launch vehicle in an emergency on the pad or during ascent. The engines, which use hypergolic propellants and generate of thrust each, are provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne. The abort system was tested successfully during the Starliner&#x27;s pad abort test on November 4, 2019, at White Sands Missile Range.

Orbital Sciences Corporation intends to sell the LAS it was building for the Orion spacecraft to future commercial crew vehicle providers in the wake of the cancellation of the Constellation project.

== Usage ==
During the Mercury-Redstone 1 mission on November 21, 1960, the escape system unintentionally blasted off from the Mercury spacecraft after the Redstone booster engine shut down just after ignition on the pad. The spacecraft remained attached to the booster on the ground.

An accidental pad firing of a launch escape system occurred during the attempted launch of the uncrewed Soyuz 7K-OK No.1 spacecraft on December 14, 1966. The vehicle&#x27;s strap-on boosters did not ignite, preventing the rocket from leaving the pad. About 30 minutes later, while the vehicle was being secured, the LES engine fired. Separation charges started a fire in the rocket&#x27;s third stage, leading to an explosion that killed a pad worker. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. Originally it was thought that the LES firing was triggered by a gantry arm that tilted the rocket past 7 degrees, meeting one of the defined in-flight abort conditions.
The first usage with a crewed mission occurred during the attempt to launch Soyuz T-10-1 on September 26, 1983. The rocket caught fire, just before launch, and the LES carried the crew capsule clear, seconds before the rocket exploded. The crew were subjected to an acceleration of 14 to 17 &quot;g&quot; (140 to 170 m/s2) for five seconds and were badly bruised. Reportedly, the capsule reached an altitude of and landed from the launch pad.

On October 11, 2018 the crew of Soyuz MS-10 separated from their launch vehicle after a booster rocket separation failure occurred at an altitude of 50 km during the ascent. However, at this point in the mission the LES had already been ejected and was not used to separate the crew capsule from the rest of the launch vehicle. Backup motors were used to separate the crew capsule resulting in the crew landing safely and uninjured approximately 19 minutes after launch.

On September 12, 2022 during Blue Origin New Shepard flight NS-23, the booster&#x27;s BE-3 engine suffered a failure at about 1 minute into the flight. The launch escape system was triggered and the capsule successfully separated and landed nominally. The flight was carrying microgravity scientific payloads in the crew capsule, without crew on board.

<text>Transition nuclear proteins (TNPs) are proteins that are involved in the packaging of sperm nuclear DNA during spermiogenesis. They take the place of histones associated with the sperm DNA, and are subsequently themselves replaced by protamines.

TNPs in humans include TNP1 and TNP2.

<text>Liz Sandals (née MacNaughton; born ) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Guelph—Wellington and Guelph. She served in cabinet as the President of the Treasury Board until January 17, 2018 and previously served for three years as Minister of Education in the government of Kathleen Wynne.

==Background==
Sandals was born and raised in the Guelph, Ontario area as Liz MacNaughton. Her father, Earl MacNaughton was the founding dean of the College of Physics at the University of Guelph. She graduated from Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute in 1966, and received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Guelph in 1969 as well as a Master of Mathematics degree from the University of Waterloo in 1971. She taught computer science at the University of Guelph. Sandals lives in Guelph with her husband David where they raised two children.

==Politics==

===School board===
Sandals was elected to her local public school board in 1988, and was re-elected four times. From 1998 to 2002, she served as president of the &quot;Ontario Public School Boards Association&quot;. Sandals was the recipient of the first &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Education Award&quot;, granted by the &quot;Ontario Principals&#x27; Council&quot;.

===Provincial politics===
In 2003, she ran for the Ontario Liberal Party nomination in the riding of Guelph, and defeated two long-time Liberals. While she was a past supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party and worked for the 1995 campaign of rival Tory MPP Brenda Elliott, Sandals defeated Elliott in the Ontario provincial election of 2003 by 2,872 votes in the riding of Guelph—Wellington. During the 2003-2007 session she served as parliamentary assistant for several portfolios including Education. After being re-elected in 2007 in the redistributed riding of Guelph, she was again appointed as parliamentary assistant to portfolios including education and transportation. She was re-elected again in the 2011 election. On February 11, 2013, Sandals was appointed as the Minister of Education by Premier Kathleen Wynne. She was re-elected in 2014. On June 13, 2016, she was appointed as President of the Treasury Board.

As Minister of Education, Sandals oversaw the transition to a new collective bargaining system in the education system in Ontario. This new 2-tier collective bargaining structure resulted in new teacher contracts being signed with all of the major teachers&#x27; unions in 2015. Sandals also oversaw changes to the sex education curriculum, the first update to the curriculum since the late 1990s.

On October 6, 2017, she announced that she would not seek re-election in 2018.

<doc id="1143228" wikidata="Q4716608" url="?curid=1143228" title="Alex Albrecht">
<text>Alexander Jennings Albrecht (born August 14, 1976) is an American television personality, actor and podcaster. He is known for co-hosting the former G4techTV television program &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, an hour-long computer and technology variety show, as well as the weekly podcast &quot;Diggnation&quot; and the weekday podcast &quot;The Totally Rad Show&quot; on the Revision3 network. On July 15, 2008, he released his new podcast/website &quot;Project Lore&quot;, all about &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. Albrecht has expressed a penchant for dressing up as characters from Street Fighter, most recently appearing as Guile. He was the Head of Original Programming at Caffeine.

==Early life==
Albrecht is the son of Dr. Mark Albrecht, former President of ILS, and Kathe Hicks Albrecht, past president and director of the Visual Resources Association, curator at American University in Washington, D.C. Alex went to elementary school at Burgundy Farm Country Day School, and graduated from American University with a degree in computer science. He was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. While at college Albrecht was a cheerleader, with ambitions of becoming a professional mascot.

==Career==
Albrecht worked for the RAND Corporation as a programmer and IT person and later worked for the Science Applications International Corporation developing multimedia programming for BP.

In 2001, he founded the improv-comedy troupe The Misfit Toys, which performed live in L.A. until 2003.

Albrecht appeared as a contestant on the gameshow &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; in 2002. He also appeared on &quot;Beat the Geeks&quot;.

Albrecht was hired by G4techTV to be the co-host alongside Kevin Rose (replacing Patrick Norton) of the television technology show, &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, for the first G4techTV episode airing from Los Angeles. The first Los Angeles-based episode of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; aired on September 7, 2004.

On August 5, 2005, Albrecht joined Revision3. Albrecht co-hosted &quot;Diggnation&quot;, a video podcast that summarizes a selection of the top stories submitted by Digg users, with former &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; co-host Kevin Rose. Albrecht also contributes to other projects for the company. He co-hosts a podcast called &quot;The Totally Rad Show&quot;, with Dan Trachtenberg and Jeff Cannata. The first episode was released on March 27, 2007. Albrecht also hosted &quot;Ctrl+Alt+Chicken&quot;, a weekly cooking show that lasted 8 episodes before being canceled in the fall of 2006.

Albrecht was featured in &quot;SWGack&quot;, a weekly podcast on the popular MMORPG, Star Wars Galaxies. On March 4, 2006, he and Joshua Brentano announced on their last episode that they would discontinue the podcast due to disenchantment with the game itself.

Albrecht and Rose also appeared in a Super Bowl ad for GoDaddy.com during Super Bowl XLI. Albrecht has appeared in a Domino&#x27;s Pizza commercial eating Domino&#x27;s pizza in a house being raided by the &quot;flavor&quot; police. Alex has also appeared in a Dell commercial, advertising the line of High-Definition Dell LCD televisions; Alex has stated that this commercial was ad libbed. He has also mentioned doing an audition for an advertisement for McDonald&#x27;s that was never aired in the US, but he has said that it was for British television.

Alex&#x27;s next project was &quot;Project Lore&quot;, which launched Tuesday, June 17, 2008. &quot;Project Lore&quot; is all about the popular video game World of Warcraft. On the show, Alex and friends have shown off all of the five main dungeons available in the game&#x27;s first expansion pack, &quot;The Burning Crusade&quot;, starting with the lower levels, and working up. Before &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;&#x27;s second expansion pack, &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot; was released, the &quot;Project Lore&quot; team were allowed to showcase some of its new beta content. Project Lore has since been abandoned; there have not been any blog posts for some time and a potential revamp proved too costly and the Project has been turned over into the hands of the volunteer bloggers in hopes that they will continue on their own.

In 2009, Alex started an iPhone app company called App Dragon which released one app later that year called Duel.

In March 2010, Alex flew with the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron (Blue Angels) in the back seat of Blue Angel #7 (frequently used for media and public relations flights).

In July, 2010, Alex seeks funding for the short film &quot;Neverland&quot; through Indiegogo, in which Alex was named as a director. According to Alex&#x27;s Twitter account, shooting started July 30, 2010.

Albrecht has also guest-starred in season 3, episode 4 of an Internet-based live-action parody of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; called &quot;The Legend of Neil&quot;. Albrecht&#x27;s character &quot;Todd&quot; was a member of a small group of soldiers from the elven army, which was led by Zelda&#x27;s brother Tyrelda. In the series, Zelda is, much to Link/Neil&#x27;s surprise, black skinned, rather than white. Her brother Tyrelda and the rest of the elf troops are black as well and make constant reference to Alex Albrecht&#x27;s character being the token white guy. A number of stereotypes associated with African-Americans in the real world are reverse-applied to Todd and the white elf race in the land of Highrule. By the end of the episode, Todd appears to have died along with Tyrelda and the rest of the gang, making for a short-lived but noteworthy contribution made by Alex to the series.

In May 2012, a new show was released on the Nerdist YouTube Channel called &quot;4 Points with Alex Albrecht&quot;. The show features 4 people discussing 4 different topics. Albrecht and co-host Alison Haislip are the only permanent members of the panel, with the other spots filled by a personality from some other Nerdist show and a celebrity, usually from TV or movies.

In April 2015, Alex and Alison Haislip started a new podcast called the &quot;Half Hour Happy Hour&quot;. He left the show in December 2018 and was replaced by Maude Garrett.

<text>Solomon Porcius Sharp (August 22, 1787 – November 7, 1825) was an American lawyer and politician, serving as attorney general of Kentucky and a member of the United States Congress and the Kentucky General Assembly. His murder by Jereboam O. Beauchamp in 1825 is referred to as the Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy or &quot;The Kentucky Tragedy.&quot;

Sharp began his political career representing Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He briefly served in the War of 1812, then returned to Kentucky and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1813. He was re-elected to a second term, though his support of a controversial bill regarding legislator salaries cost him his seat in 1816. Allied with Kentucky&#x27;s Debt Relief Party, he returned to the Kentucky House in 1817; in 1821, he accepted Governor John Adair&#x27;s appointment to the post of Attorney General of Kentucky. Adair&#x27;s successor, Joseph Desha, re-appointed him to this position. In 1825, Sharp resigned as attorney general to return to the Kentucky House.

In 1820, rumors surfaced that Sharp had fathered a stillborn illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter&#x27;s daughter. Sharp denied the charge and the immediate political effects were minimal. When the charges were repeated during Sharp&#x27;s 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation that the child was a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp&#x27;s murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s unfinished play &quot;Politian&quot; and Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s novel &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; (1950).

==Personal life==
Solomon Sharp was born on August 22, 1787, at Abingdon, Washington County, Virginia. He was the fifth child and third son of Captain Thomas and Jean (Maxwell) Sharp, a Scottish woman. Through the male line he was a great-great-grandson of John Sharp, Archbishop of York. His father Thomas Sharp was a veteran of the Revolutionary War, participating in the Battle of King&#x27;s Mountain. The family briefly moved to the area near Nashville, Tennessee, and to North Carolina before settling permanently about 1795 at Russellville, Logan County where they lived in a log cabin near the Muddy River.

Sharp &quot;[intermittently attended] one of Logan County&#x27;s academies&quot; during his childhood years; the schools of Logan County were primitive at the time. He read the law and was admitted to the bar in 1806. He opened a practice in Russellville, but soon relocated to the busier Warren County seat of Bowling Green, which had 154 residents in 1810. He engaged in land speculation, sometimes in partnership with his brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, and by 1824, had acquired 11,000 acres, mostly north of the Barren River in Warren County.

==Marriage and family==
After becoming established, on December 17, 1818, Sharp at the age of 31 married Eliza T. Scott, the daughter of a physician who had served as an officer in the War of 1812. She was from Frankfort and above him in social standing. They had three children together. He moved the family to the state capital of Frankfort in 1820 for his political career.

==Political career==
In 1809, Sharp was elected to represent Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his tenure, he supported the legislature&#x27;s election of Henry Clay to the U.S. Senate, the creation of a state lottery, and the creation of an academy in Barren County. He served on a number of committees, and for a time served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly&#x27;s second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. During the 1811 session, Sharp worked with Ben Hardin to secure passage of a bill to ensure that state officers and attorneys at law would not be involved in dueling. He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves.

Sharp&#x27;s political service was interrupted by the War of 1812. On September 18, 1812, he enlisted as a private in the Kentucky militia, serving under Lieutenant Colonel Young Ewing. Twelve days later, in a rapid rise even for the militia, he was promoted to major and made a part of Ewing&#x27;s staff. Ewing&#x27;s unit was put under the command of general Samuel Hopkins during his ineffective expedition against the Shawnee. In total, the expedition lasted forty-two days and never engaged the enemy. Sharp recognized the value of a record of military service in Kentucky politics, however; he was eventually promoted to the rank of colonel.

===U.S. Representative===
In 1812, Sharp was elected to the Thirteenth Congress as a member of the United States House of Representatives and took his seat at the age of 25, the minimum for election. Aligning with the War Hawks, he defended President James Madison&#x27;s decision to lead the country into the war, and supported a proposal to offer of land to any British deserters. Sharp also &quot;[passionately denounced] Federalist obstruction of the war effort&quot;. In a speech on April 8, 1813, he opposed indemnity for those defrauded in the Yazoo land scandal in Mississippi. He allied with South Carolina&#x27;s John C. Calhoun in supporting the Second Bank of the United States.

Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, during which he served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.

In 1817, Sharp was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his term, he supported measures for internal improvements, but opposed the creation of a state health board and a proposal to open the state&#x27;s vacant lands to the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the War of 1812. Most notably, he supported the creation of 46 new banks in the state, and proposed a tax on the branches of the Bank of the United States in Lexington and Louisville.

===Accusations of illegitimate child===
In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an unmarried planter&#x27;s daughter in her early 30s, claimed that Sharp was the father of her illegitimate child; Sharp denied her claim. The stillborn child was rumored to have dark skin, and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father&#x27;s death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.

The scandal soon abated for Sharp, as Anna had a reputation as &quot;a freethinker, reader of romantic fiction, and a libertine&quot;. Although Sharp&#x27;s political opponents would continue to call attention to his putative child in future campaigns, his reputation remained largely untarnished.

===Attorney general of Kentucky===
In 1821, Sharp began a campaign for a seat in the Kentucky Senate. His opponent, attorney John U. Waring, was a notably violent and contentious man, frequently in court because of altercations. (In 1835, he shot and killed the attorney Samuel Q. Richardson).

Waring sent two threatening letters to Sharp, and on June 18, 1821, published a handbill attacking Sharp&#x27;s character. Five days later, Sharp ceased campaigning for the senatorial seat. He accepted an appointment by Governor John Adair to the position of attorney general of Kentucky. Sharp&#x27;s nomination was unanimously confirmed by the legislature on October 30, 1821.

Sharp took office at a critical time Kentucky&#x27;s history. Still reeling from the financial Panic of 1819, state politicians had split into two camps: those who supported legislation favorable to debtors (the Debt Relief Party) and those who favored the protection of creditors (typically called Anti-Reliefers.) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party, as had Governor Adair.

In the 1824 presidential election, Sharp alienated some of his constituency by supporting his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky&#x27;s favorite son, Henry Clay. When it was clear that Calhoun&#x27;s bid would fail, Sharp threw his support behind Andrew Jackson. He served as secretary of a meeting of Jackson supporters in Frankfort on October 2, 1824.

After Governor Adair&#x27;s term expired in 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as attorney general. The Relief faction in the legislature passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky&#x27;s court of last resort; this period was referred to as the Old Court-New Court controversy.

Sharp&#x27;s role in the Relief Party&#x27;s plan to abolish the old court and replace it with a new, more favorable court is not known. As he was the administration&#x27;s chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.

=== State House of Representatives ===
On May 11, 1825, Sharp was chosen to represent the Desha administration in welcoming the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution, to Kentucky. At a banquet in Lafayette&#x27;s honor three days later, Sharp toasted the guest of honor: &quot;The People: Liberty will always be safe in their holy keeping.&quot; Shortly following this event, Sharp resigned as attorney general, likely because Relief Party advocates thought he would be more useful as a member of the General Assembly.

The Anti-Relief partisans nominated former Senator John J. Crittenden for one of the two seats apportioned to Franklin County in the state House. The Relief Party countered with Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent area lawyer. During the sharply contested campaign, both John U. Waring and Patrick Henry Darby, a land speculator, said that Sharp&#x27;s life was at risk if he won. Opponents revived the charges of Sharp&#x27;s illegitimate child. It was also alleged that Sharp had claimed that the child was mulatto and said he had a certificate from Cooke&#x27;s midwife to that effect; whether Sharp made this claim may never be known for certain. Despite the controversy, Sharp netted the most votes in the election, winning by 69 out of a total of 1600 votes cast in the county.

==Murder and aftermath==


In the early hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp&#x27;s residence. When Sharp answered the door, the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o&#x27;clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.

Because of the bitterness of the campaign and the timing of the murder, speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp&#x27;s political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources. In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.

In the investigation that followed, the evidence quickly pointed to Jereboam O. Beauchamp, 23, who had married the much older Anna Cooke in 1824. On November 11, 1825, a four-man posse arrested Beauchamp at his home in Franklin.

He was tried and convicted of Sharp&#x27;s murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence – execution by hanging – was to be carried out on June 16, 1826. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution so that he could write a justification of his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife&#x27;s honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, &quot;The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp&quot;. After two suicide attempts with his wife, who died as a result of the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826. Beauchamp&#x27;s &quot;Confession&quot; was published in 1826. Some editions included &quot;The Letters of Ann Cook&quot; as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author.

The following year, Sharp&#x27;s brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote &quot;Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp&quot; to defend him from the charges contained in Beauchamp&#x27;s confession. In &quot;Vindication&quot;, Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing as a political assassination: he named Patrick Darby, a partisan of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart. Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his &quot;Vindication&quot;; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.

==In popular culture==
The events have inspired numerous works of fiction, drama and history:
*Charles Fenno Hoffman&#x27;s novel, &quot;Greyslayer&quot;
*William Gilmore Simms&#x27;s novel, &quot;Beauchamp&quot;
*Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s unfinished play, &quot;Politian&quot;
*J.G. Dana and R.S. Thomas&#x27;s history, &quot;Beauchamp&#x27;s Trial&quot;. 
*L.F. Johnson included it in his &quot;Tragedies and Trials&quot;. 
*1950, J. Winston Coleman published a history of the events. 
*1950, Robert Penn Warren wrote a novel that was a &quot;critique of romantic values&quot; in &quot;World Enough and Time.&quot;
*Richard Taylor&#x27;s play, &quot;Three Kentucky Tragedies&quot;, was based on this. 
*1992 John Hawkins created an outdoor drama on this subject, &quot;Wounded is the Wounding Heart&quot;, produced in Frankfort, Kentucky.

<text>Kimberly Goss is an American singer and keyboardist, best known as frontwoman and co-founder of the Finnish metal band Sinergy.

==Early life==

Goss was born in Los Angeles, California, to a Korean father and a German mother who worked as a jazz singer. Shortly after, she went with her mother to live in Japan, before coming back to the United States and settling down in Chicago, Illinois, where she was raised for most of her childhood.

==Career==

Goss started her career in music early, debuting as a singer for the underground band &quot;Avernus&quot; at the age of fifteen. She went on to write and publish her own underground extreme metal fanzine at the age of sixteen, interviewing widely recognized bands such as Emperor, Darkthrone, Mayhem and Bathory, to name a few. At seventeen, she moved to Norway in order to pursue an offer she received to play keyboards for Norwegian black metal band Ancient. After recording one album with them, they went on tour with Dark Funeral and Bal-Sagoth. Two days after that tour ended, she was also invited to play keyboards and sing backing vocals on Therion&#x27;s world tour in support of their &quot;Theli&quot; album. With Therion, she toured with bands like Amorphis, Sentenced and My Dying Bride as well as playing major European festivals like Dynamo Open Air.

In 1997 she was also asked to join Dimmu Borgir as a session keyboardist where they went on to tour to promote their album, &quot;Enthrone Darkness Triumphant&quot;. During the tour with In Flames in August 1997, she met guitarist Jesper Strömblad and together they formed the first incarnation of Sinergy. She moved to Sweden in 1998 to rehearse with the first line-up of the band and proceeded to record their debut album, &quot;Beware the Heavens&quot;. She then went on to temporarily play keyboards for Children of Bodom during their 1998 European tour while their own keyboardist was occupied with school. Shortly after, she relocated once again and moved to Finland, where together with original band member Alexi Laiho, they reformed Sinergy with Finnish musicians. Over the years Sinergy has teamed up to tour with the likes of Nightwish, Angra, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames and Children of Bodom. They&#x27;ve also played some of the biggest metal festivals in the world including Wacken Open Air.

The success of Sinergy in Japan resulted in Goss receiving an offer to write a monthly column for over three years in &quot;Burrn!&quot; magazine, the country&#x27;s most popular music publication. Goss has also made contributions to other bands, writing some lyrics for Children of Bodom on three of their albums, and lending her voice to guest sing with other artists, including Warmen, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, To/Die/For, Exhumation, Kylähullut and The Wicked.

The fourth Sinergy album, &quot;Sins of the Past&quot;, began production in 2004, but due to Children of Bodom&#x27;s busy schedule the album was never completed. Alexi Laiho stated in an interview with Ultimate-Guitar.com in February 2011 that Sinergy is now defunct. In mid-2011, Kimberly began scoring background music for various TV shows that have aired on The CW, ABC Family, Freeform, Syfy and MTV, among others.

== Personal life ==
Goss was in a long-term relationship with and eventually married guitarist Alexi Laiho, who played lead guitar for both Sinergy and Children of Bodom (in which Alexi also did lead vocals). The couple separated in 2004, although they still remained close friends. They both shared identical tattoos of a coiled snake around their ring fingers and also had each other&#x27;s initials tattooed on the upper part of their left arms. After Laiho&#x27;s death in 2020, the Finnish media revealed that they never got divorced, and were on good terms and had regular text and video contact until the day he died.

<text>In railway signalling, an interlocking is an arrangement of signal apparatus that prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of tracks such as junctions or crossings. In North America, a set of signalling appliances and tracks interlocked together are sometimes collectively referred to as an &quot;interlocking plant&quot; or just as an &quot;interlocking&quot;. An interlocking system is designed so that it is impossible to display a signal to proceed unless the route to be used is proven safe.

Interlocking is a safety measure designed to prevent signals and points/switches from being changed in an improper sequence. For example, interlocking would prevent a signal from being changed to indicate a diverging route, unless the corresponding points/switches had been changed first. In North America, the official railroad definition of interlocking is: &quot;An arrangement of signals and signal appliances so interconnected that their movements must succeed each other in proper sequence&quot;.

== Configuration and use ==
A minimal interlocking consists of signals, but usually includes additional appliances such as points and Facing Point locks (US: switches) and derails, and may include crossings at grade and movable bridges. Some of the fundamental principles of interlocking include:
* Signals may not be operated to permit conflicting train movements to take place at the same time on set route.
* Switches and other appliances in the route must be properly &#x27;set&#x27; (in position) before a signal may allow train movements to enter that route.
* Once a route is &quot;set&quot; and a train is given a signal to proceed over that route, all switches and other movable appliances in the route are locked in position until either
** the train passes out of the portion of the route affected, or
** the signal to proceed is withdrawn and sufficient time has passed to ensure that a train approaching that route has had opportunity to come to a stop before passing the signal.

==History==
Railway interlocking is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby received the first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby &amp; Farmer) was awarded a patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 mechanical locking levers were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.

The first experiment with mechanical interlocking in the United States took place in 1875 by J. M. Toucey and William Buchanan at Spuyten Duyvil Junction in New York on the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad (NYC&amp;HRR). At the time, Toucey was General Superintendent and Buchanan was Superintendent of Machinery on the NYC&amp;HRR. Toucey and Buchanan formed the Toucey and Buchanan Interlocking Switch and Signal Company in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1878. The first important installations of their mechanism were on the switches and signals of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company and the New York Elevated Railroad Company in 1877–78. Compared to Saxby&#x27;s design, Toucey and Buchanans&#x27; interlocking mechanism was more cumbersome and less sophisticated, and so was not implemented very widely. Union Switch &amp; Signal bought their company in 1882.

As technology advanced the railway signaling industry looked to incorporate these new technologies into interlockings to increase the speed of route setting, the number of appliances controlled from a single point and to expand the distance that those same appliances could be operated from the point of control. The challenge facing the signal industry was achieving the same level of safety and reliability that was inherent to purely mechanical systems. An experimental hydro-pneumatic interlocking was installed at the Bound Brook, New Jersey junction of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1884. By 1891, there were 18 hydro-pneumatic plants, on six railroads, operating a total of 482 levers. The installations worked, but there were serious defects in the design, and little saving of labour was achieved.

The inventors of the hydro-pneumatic system moved forward to an electro-pneumatic system in 1891 and this system, best identified with the Union Switch &amp; Signal Company, was first installed on the Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad at its drawbridge across the Chicago River. By 1900, 54 electro-pneumatic interlocking plants, controlling a total of 1,864 interlocking levers, were in use on 13 North American railroads. This type of system would remain one of two viable competing systems into the future, although it did have the disadvantage of needing extra single-use equipment and requiring high maintenance.

Interlockings using electric motors for moving switches and signals became viable in 1894, when Siemens in Austria installed the first such interlocking at Přerov (now in the Czech Republic). Another interlocking of this type was installed in Westend near Berlin in 1896. In North America, the first installation of an interlocking plant using electric switch machines was at Eau Claire, Wisconsin on the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway in 1901, by General Railway Signal Company (GRS, now a unit of Alstom, headquartered in Levallois-Perret, near Paris). By 1913, this type system had been installed on 83 railroads across 35 US states and Canadian provinces, in 440 interlocking plants using 21,370 levers.

== Interlocking types ==
Interlockings can be categorized as mechanical, electrical (electro-mechanical or relay-based), or electronic/computer-based.

=== Mechanical interlocking ===

In mechanical interlocking plants, a &quot;locking bed&quot; is constructed, consisting of steel bars forming a grid. The levers that operate switches, derails, signals or other appliances are connected to the bars running in one direction. The bars are constructed so that if the function controlled by a given lever conflicts with that controlled by another lever, mechanical interference is set up in the &quot;cross locking&quot; between the two bars, in turn preventing the conflicting lever movement from being made.

In purely mechanical plants, the levers operate the field devices, such as signals, directly via a mechanical rodding or wire connection. The levers are about shoulder height since they must supply a mechanical advantage for the operator. Cross locking of levers was effected such that the extra leverage could not defeat the locking (preliminary latch lock).

The first mechanical interlocking was installed in 1843 at Bricklayers Arms Junction, England.

=== Electro-mechanical interlocking ===
Power interlockings may also use mechanical locking to ensure the proper sequencing of levers, but the levers are considerably smaller as they themselves do not directly control the field devices. If the lever is free to move based on the locking bed, contacts on the levers actuate the switches and signals which are operated electrically or electro-pneumatically. Before a control lever may be moved into a position which would release other levers, a signal must be received from the field element that it has actually moved into the position requested. The locking bed shown is for a GRS power interlocking machine.

=== Relay interlocking ===
Interlockings effected purely electrically (sometimes referred to as &quot;all-electric&quot;) consist of complex circuitry made up of relays in an arrangement of relay logic that ascertain the state or position of each signal appliance. As appliances are operated, their change of position opens some circuits that lock out other appliances that would conflict with the new position. Similarly, other circuits are closed when the appliances they control become safe to operate. Equipment used for railroad signalling tends to be expensive because of its specialized nature and fail-safe design.

Interlockings operated solely by electrical circuitry may be operated locally or remotely, with the large mechanical levers of previous systems being replaced by buttons, switches or toggles on a panel or video interface. Such an interlocking may also be designed to operate without a human operator. These arrangements are termed &quot;automatic interlockings&quot;, and the approach of a train sets its own route automatically, provided no conflicting movements are in progress.

GRS manufactured the first all-relay interlocking system in 1929. It was installed in Lincoln, Nebraska on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

Entrance-Exit Interlocking (NX) was the original brand name of the first generation relay-based centralized traffic control (CTC) interlocking system introduced in 1936 by GRS (represented in Europe by Metropolitan-Vickers). The advent of all electric interlocking technology allowed for more automated route setting procedures as opposed to having an operator line each part of the route manually. The NX system allowed an operator looking at the diagram of a complicated junction to simply push a button on the known entrance track and another button on the desired exit track. The logic circuitry handled all the necessary actions of commanding the underlying relay interlocking to set signals and throw switches in the proper sequence, as required to provide valid route through the interlocking plant. The first NX installation was in 1937 at Brunswick on the Cheshire Lines, UK. The first US installation was on the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) at Girard Junction, Ohio in 1937. Another NYCRR installation was on the main line between Utica, New York and Rochester, New York, and this was quickly followed up by three installations on the New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Fulton Street Line in 1948.

Other NX style systems were implemented by other railroad signal providers. For example, Union Route (UR) was the brand name of their Entrance-Exit system supplied by Union Switch &amp; Signal Co. (US&amp;S), and introduced in 1951. NX type systems and their costly pre-solid state control logic only tended to be installed in the busier or more complicated terminal areas where it could increase capacity and reduce staffing requirements. In a move that was popular in Europe, the signalling for an entire area was condensed into a single large power signal box with a control panel in the operator&#x27;s area and the equivalent of a telephone exchange in the floors below that combined the vital relay based interlocking logic and non-vital control logic in one place. Such advanced schemes would also include train describer and train tracking technologies. Away from complex terminals unit lever control systems remained popular until the 1980s when solid state interlocking and control systems began to replace the older relay plants of all types.

=== Electronic interlocking ===
Modern interlockings (those installed since the late 1980s) are generally solid state, where the wired networks of relays are replaced by software logic running on special-purpose control hardware. The fact that the logic is implemented by software rather than hard-wired circuitry greatly facilitates the ability to make modifications when needed by reprogramming rather than rewiring. In many implementations, this vital logic is stored as firmware or in ROM that cannot be easily altered to both resist unsafe modification and meet regulatory safety testing requirements. As display technology improved, the hard wired physical devices could be updated with visual display units (computer monitors), which allowed changes in field equipment be represented to the signaller without any hardware modifications.

&quot;Solid State Interlocking&quot; (SSI) is the brand name in trade of work of the first generation microprocessor-based interlocking developed in the 1980s by British Rail, GEC-General Signal and Westinghouse Signals Ltd in the UK. Second generation processor-based interlockings are known by the term &quot;Computer Based Interlocking&quot; (CBI), of which VPI (trademark of General Railway Signal, now Alstom), MicroLok (trademark of Union Switch &amp; Signal, now Hitachi Rail STS), Westlock and Westrace (trademarks of Invensys Rail, now Siemens), and [Smartlock] (trademark of Alstom), and EBI Lock (trademark of Bombardier) are examples.

== Defined forms of locking ==
; Electric locking : &quot;The combination of one or more electric locks or controlling circuits by means of which levers in an interlocking machine, or switches or other devices operated in connection with signalling and interlocking, are secured against operation under certain conditions.&quot;

; Section locking : &quot;Electric locking effective while a train occupies a given section of a route and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers that would endanger the train while it is within that section.&quot;

; Route locking : &quot;Electric locking taking effect when a train passes a signal and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers that would endanger the train while it is within the limits of the route entered.&quot;

; Sectional route locking : &quot;Route locking so arranged that a train, in clearing each section of the route, releases the locking affecting that section.&quot;

; Approach locking : &quot;Electric locking effective while a train is approaching a signal that has been set for it to proceed and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers or devices that would endanger that train.&quot;

; Stick locking : &quot;Electric locking taking effect upon the setting of a signal for a train to proceed, released by a passing train, and adapted to prevent manipulation of levers that would endanger an approaching train.&quot;

; Indication locking : &quot;Electric locking adapted to prevent any manipulation of levers that would bring about an unsafe condition in case a signal, switch, or other operated device fails to make a movement corresponding with that of the operating lever; or adapted directly to prevent the operation of one device in case another device, to be operated first, fails to make the required movement.&quot;

; Check locking or traffic locking : &quot;Electric locking that enforces cooperation between the Operators at two adjacent plants in such a manner that prevents opposing signals governing the same track from being set to proceed at the same time. In addition, after a signal has been cleared and accepted by a train, check locking prevents an opposing signal at the adjacent interlocking plant from being cleared until the train has passed through that plant.&quot;

== Complete and incomplete interlockings (U.S. terminology) ==
Interlockings allow trains to cross from one track to another using a turnout and a series of switches. Railroad terminology defines the following types of interlockings as either &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; depending on the movements available. Although timetables generally do not identify an interlocking as one or the other, and rule books do not define the terms, the terms below are generally agreed upon by system crews and rules officials.

; Complete interlockings : allow continuous movements from any track on one side of the interlocking to any track on the opposite side without the use of a reverse move within the limits of the interlocking. This is true even if there are differing numbers of tracks on opposing sides, or if the interlocking has multiple sides.

; Incomplete interlockings : do not allow such movements as described above. Movements in an incomplete interlocking may be limited and may even require reverse movements to achieve the desired route.

<doc id="1143275" wikidata="Q317445" url="?curid=1143275" title="Richard Winters">
<text>Richard Davis Winters (January 21, 1918January 2, 2011) was a United States Army officer who served as a paratrooper in &quot;Easy Company&quot; of the 506th Infantry Regiment within the 101st Airborne Division during World War II. Winters was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his successful command of the assault on Brécourt Manor during the invasion of Normandy. 

His exploits were featured within numerous books and in the 2001 HBO mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actor Damian Lewis.

==Early life and education==

Winters was born in New Holland, Pennsylvania, to Richard and Edith Winters on January 21, 1918. The family soon moved to nearby Ephrata, and then to Lancaster when he was eight years old. He graduated from Lancaster Boys High School in 1937 and attended Franklin and Marshall College.

At Franklin and Marshall, Winters was a member of the Upsilon chapter of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity and participated in intramural football and basketball. He had to give up wrestling, his favorite sport, and most of his social activities in favor of his studies and the part-time jobs that paid his way through college. He graduated in June 1941 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics, earning the highest academic standing in the business college.

==Military service==
===World War II===
====Training====
Winters wrote in his memoirs that he &quot;felt a strong sense of duty,&quot; but &quot;had no desire to get into the war&quot; and chose to let himself be drafted after graduating college instead of living with the uncertainty of being called up at an unknown future date, which might have &quot;interrupt[ed] a promising business career,&quot; and to fulfill the one-year requirement of service for draftees rather than the three-year term for Regular volunteers. He was inducted into the Army on August 25, 1941, at the New Cumberland Reception Center near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In September, he underwent basic training at Camp Croft, South Carolina. While the rest of his fellow trainees were deployed to units stationed in the Panama Canal Zone in early December, Winters remained at Camp Croft to help train draftees and other volunteers. In April 1942, four months after the United States entered World War II, he was selected to attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) at Fort Benning, Georgia. There he became friends with Lewis Nixon, with whom he would serve throughout the war. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry after graduating from OCS on July 2, 1942.

During his officer training, Winters decided to join the parachute infantry, part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s new airborne forces. Upon completing training, he returned to Camp Croft to train another class of draftees as there were no positions available in the paratroopers at that time. After five weeks, he received orders to join the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (506th PIR) at Camp Toccoa in Georgia. The 506th was commanded by Colonel Robert Sink.

Winters arrived at Toccoa in mid-August 1942 and was assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th PIR, which later became better known as &quot;Easy Company&quot; in accordance with the contemporaneous Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. Serving under First Lieutenant Herbert Sobel, Winters was made platoon leader of 2nd Platoon, earning a promotion to first lieutenant in October 1942 and made acting company executive officer, although this was not made official until May 1943. The 506th PIR was an experimental unit, the first regiment to undertake airborne training as a formed unit. The training at Toccoa was very tough. Of the 500 officers who had volunteered, only 148 completed the course; of 5,000 enlisted volunteers, only 1,800 were ultimately selected for duty as paratroopers.

On June 10, 1943, after more tactical training at Camp Mackall, North Carolina, the 506th PIR was attached to Major General William Lee&#x27;s 101st &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; Airborne Division. Later in the year, they embarked on the &quot;Samaria&quot;, and arrived in Liverpool on September 15, 1943. They proceeded to Aldbourne, Wiltshire, where they began intense training for the Allied invasion of Europe planned for spring 1944.

In November and December 1943, while Easy Company was at Aldbourne, the tension that had been brewing between Winters and Sobel came to a head. For some time, Winters had privately held concerns over Sobel&#x27;s ability to lead the company in combat. Many of the enlisted men in the company had come to respect Winters for his competence and had also developed their own concerns about Sobel&#x27;s leadership. Winters later said that he never wanted to compete with Sobel for command of Easy Company; still, Sobel attempted to bring Winters up on trumped-up charges for &quot;failure to carry out a lawful order&quot;. Feeling that his punishment was unjust, Winters requested that the charge be reviewed by court-martial. After Winters&#x27; punishment was set aside by the battalion commander, Major Robert L. Strayer, Sobel brought Winters up on another charge the following day. During the investigation, Winters was transferred to the Headquarters Company and appointed as the battalion mess officer.

In the wake of this incident, several of the company&#x27;s non-commissioned officers (NCOs) delivered an ultimatum to the regimental commander, Colonel Sink, threatening to surrender their stripes unless Sobel was replaced. Winters tried unsuccessfully to talk them out of taking this step. Sink was not impressed by the threat, and several of the NCOs were subsequently demoted or transferred out of the company. Nevertheless, he realized that something had to be done and decided to transfer Sobel out of Easy Company, giving him command of a new parachute training school at Chilton Foliat. Winters&#x27; court-martial was set aside and he returned to Easy Company as leader of 1st Platoon. Winters later said he felt that despite his differences with Sobel, at least part of Easy Company&#x27;s success had been due to Sobel&#x27;s strenuous training and high expectations. In February 1944, First Lieutenant Thomas Meehan was given command of Easy Company.

==== Summer 1944 ====
Meehan remained in command of the company until the invasion of Normandy, when at about 1:15 a.m. on June 6, 1944, D-Day, the C-47 Skytrain transporting most of the company Headquarters Section was shot down by German anti-aircraft fire, killing everyone on board. Winters jumped that night and landed safely near Sainte-Mère-Église. Losing his weapon during the drop, he nevertheless oriented himself, assembled several paratroopers, including members of the 82nd Airborne Division, and proceeded toward the unit&#x27;s assigned objective near Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. With Meehan&#x27;s fate unknown, Winters became the &quot;de facto&quot; commanding officer (CO) of Easy Company, which he remained for the duration of the Normandy campaign.

Later that day, Winters led the Brécourt Manor Assault which successfully destroyed a battery of German 105mm howitzers, which were firing onto the causeways that served as the principal exits from Utah Beach. The Americans estimated that the guns, which were south of the village of Le Grand-Chemin, were defended by about a platoon of 50 German troops, while Winters had 13 men. The attack has since been taught at West Point as a textbook example of an assault on a fixed position by a numerically inferior force. In addition to destroying the battery, Winters also obtained a map that showed German gun emplacements near Utah Beach.

On July 1, 1944, Winters was told that he had been promoted to captain. The next day, he was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, then the commander of the U.S. First Army. Shortly after, the 506th Parachute Infantry was withdrawn from France and returned to Aldbourne, England, for reorganization. The citation for his DSC reads as follows:

==== Autumn 1944 ====
In September 1944, the 506th PIR parachuted into the Netherlands, near the village of Son, north of Eindhoven, as part of Operation Market Garden, a combined airborne and armored operation. On 5 October 1944, a German force attacked the 2nd Battalion&#x27;s flank and threatened to break through the American lines. At the same time, four men in an Easy Company patrol were wounded. Returning to headquarters, they reported that they had encountered a large group of Germans at a crossroads about to the east of the company command post. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Winters took one squad from 1st Platoon, and moved off toward the crossroads, where they observed a German machine gun firing to the south, toward the battalion headquarters, from a long distance. After surveying the position, Winters led the squad in an assault on the gun crew. Soon after taking the position, the squad took fire from a German position opposite them. Estimating that this position was held by at least a platoon, Winters called for reinforcements from the rest of the 1st Platoon and led them, and a platoon from Fox Company in a successful assault. Later it was discovered there had been at least 300 Germans.

On October 9, Winters became the battalion executive officer (XO), following the death of the battalion&#x27;s former XO, Major Oliver Horton. Although this position was normally held by a major, Winters filled it as a captain. The 101st Airborne Division was withdrawn to France soon afterward.

==== Winter 1944–45 and spring 1945 ====
On December 16, 1944, German forces launched a counter-offensive against the Western Allies in Belgium, starting the Battle of the Bulge. The 101st Airborne Division was trucked to the Bastogne area two days later. Still serving as XO of the 2nd Battalion, Winters helped defend the line northeast of Bastogne near the town of Foy. The entire 101st Airborne and elements of the 10th Armored Division battled about 15 German divisions, supported by heavy artillery and armor, for nearly a week before Lieutenant General George Patton&#x27;s U.S. Third Army broke through the German lines surrounding Bastogne, reopening ground supply lines.

After being relieved by Patton, the 2nd Battalion attacked Foy on January 9, 1945. On March 8, 1945, the 2nd Battalion was moved to Haguenau in Alsace, after which Winters was promoted to major. Shortly afterwards, Robert Strayer, now a lieutenant colonel, was elevated to the regimental staff and Winters took over as acting commander of the 2nd Battalion.

In April, the battalion carried out defensive duties along the Rhine before moving to Bavaria later in the month. In early May, the 101st Airborne Division received orders to capture Berchtesgaden. The 2nd Battalion set out from the town of Thale through streams of surrendering German soldiers and reached the alpine retreat at noon on 5 May 1945. Three days later, the war in Europe ended.

==== Post-war assignments ====
After the end of hostilities, Winters remained in Europe as the process of occupation and demobilization began. Even though he had enough points to return to the United States, he was told that he was needed in Germany. Later, he was offered a regular (non-reserve) commission, but declined it. He finally embarked from Marseille aboard the &quot;Wooster Victory&quot; on 4 November 1945. He was separated from the Army on November 29, 1945, although he was not officially discharged until January 22, 1946, and he remained on terminal leave until then.

Winters was recommended for the Medal of Honor for his leadership at Brécourt Manor, but instead received the U.S. Army&#x27;s second-highest award for combat valor, the Distinguished Service Cross. After the release of the &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; television miniseries, Representative Tim Holden (D-PA) introduced a bill asking the President to grant the Medal, but the bill died in the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Military Personnel in 2007.

===Korean War===
After his discharge from the Army, Winters worked as a production supervisor for his close wartime friend Captain Lewis Nixon at Nixon&#x27;s family business, Nixon Nitration Works of Nixon, New Jersey (now Edison Township), rising to become general manager in 1950. On May 16, 1948, Winters married Ethel Estoppey and continued to pursue his education through the GI Bill, attending a number of business and personnel management courses at Rutgers University.

In 1951, he and his wife bought a small farm where later they built a home and raised two children. In June 1951, Winters was recalled to active duty in the Army during the Korean War. He was ordered to join the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, but he was given six months to report and in this time he traveled to Washington, D.C., to speak to General Anthony McAuliffe, in the hope that he could convince the Army not to send him to Korea. He explained to McAuliffe that he had seen enough of war and apparently McAuliffe understood his position, but explained that he was needed because of his command experience. Winters then reported to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where he was assigned as a regimental planning and training officer.

While at Fort Dix, Winters became disillusioned with his job, finding that he had little enthusiasm for training officers who lacked discipline and did not attend their scheduled classes. As a result, he volunteered to attend Ranger School, where he passed and became a Ranger. He then received orders to deploy to Korea and traveled to Seattle, where, during pre-deployment administration, he was offered the option of resigning his commission, which he accepted.

==Later life==

In 1972, Winters went into business for himself, starting his own company and selling animal feed products to farmers throughout Pennsylvania. Soon afterward, he moved his family to Hershey, Pennsylvania. He retired in 1997, aged 79.

During the 1990s, Winters was featured in a number of books and television series about his experiences and those of the men in Easy Company. In 1992, Stephen Ambrose wrote the book &quot;Band of Brothers: Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler&#x27;s Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which was subsequently turned into an HBO mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, with Damian Lewis portraying Winters. 

Winters also attended the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 22, 2002 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles when the &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; miniseries was nominated in multiple categories. When it won Outstanding Miniseries (one of seven wins), Winters spoke at co-creator and executive producer Steven Spielberg&#x27;s invitation on behalf of Easy Company while other surviving members of the company watched from the Los Angeles St. Regis Hotel.
Winters was the subject of the 2005 book &quot;Biggest Brother: The Life of Major Dick Winters, The Man Who Led the Band of Brothers&quot;, written by Larry Alexander. His own memoir, &quot;Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters&quot;, co-written by military historian and retired U.S. Army Colonel Cole C. Kingseed, was published in early 2006. He also gave a number of lectures on leadership to cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point.

On May 16, 2009, Franklin and Marshall College conferred an honorary doctorate in humane letters upon Winters.

Despite the many accolades he had received, Winters remained humble about his service. During an interview for &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; that was both the miniseries&#x27; final scene and included in the official HBO companion documentary &quot;We Stand Alone Together&quot;, Winters quoted a passage from a letter he received from Sergeant Myron &quot;Mike&quot; Ranney:
==Death==

Winters died on January 2, 2011, at an assisted living facility in Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, aged 92. He had suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for several years. Winters was buried in a private funeral service, which was held on January 8, 2011. He was buried in the Bergstrasse Evangelical Lutheran Church cemetery in Ephrata, Pennsylvania, next to his parents in the Winters&#x27; family plot. His grave is marked &quot;Richard D. Winters, World War II 101st Airborne&quot;. His wife Ethel died on April 11, 2012 at Country Meadows, Hershey. She was 89 years old.

===Memorials===
On June 6, 2012, the 68th anniversary of the D-Day landings, the Richard D. Winters Leadership Monument, featuring a bronze statue of Winters by sculptor Stephen C. Spears was unveiled near the village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, France . Winters agreed for the statue to bear his resemblance on the condition that the monument would be dedicated to all junior officers who served and died during the Normandy landings. Among the attendees were World War II veterans, former Pennsylvania governor and first Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge and Maj. Gen. Jim McConville, the 101st Airborne&#x27;s commanding officer. During celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the landings in 2014, a party including Lewis, fellow &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; cast members Ross McCall (Technician 5th Grade Joseph Liebgott) and James Madio (Technician 4th Grade Frank Perconte) and Private 1st Class Jim &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Martin of G Company, 3rd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment laid a wreath there.

A cast of the sculpture was placed in Ephrata, Pennsylvania, in a plaza on the Ephrata-to-Warwick linear trail park near Railroad Avenue and East Fulton Street, where Winters lived with his family from ages two to eight. That statue was dedicated on May 25, 2015.

Some of Winters&#x27; World War II uniforms and memorabilia are on display at two museums:
* December 44 Museum (Battle of the Bulge – La Gleize, Belgium)
* Gettysburg Museum of History (Gettysburg Pennsylvania)

In 2019, a US merchant vessel owned by Sealift Incorporated, was renamed the M/V Maj Richard Winters. 

==Medals and decorations==
 Five Overseas Service Bars for serving 2½ years overseas in Europe.

In 2001, Winters, as a representative on behalf of the U.S. Army, was one of five World War II veterans to be awarded the Freedom Medal &amp; Freedom from Fear Medal from the Roosevelt Institute.

<text>Tokyo Warhearts is the first live album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, recorded in 1999. It was recorded and filmed at Club Citta on 10 and 11 July 1999 in Tokyo. The album was re-released on 29 May 2001. The band and their record label, Spinefarm Records, had plans to release the show as a DVD along with the CD, but they reached the conclusion that there were some mismatches between the video and the audio, as there was video footage from two different shows.

Two of the songs from this album have been released separately for promotional purposes and can be found on a Spinefarm DVD compilation: &quot;Silent Night, Bodom Night&quot; and &quot;Deadnight Warrior&quot;.

Track 1 covers a segment of Jan Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot; from the Miami Vice soundtrack. At the end of track 6, a brief part of the riff of &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; by Japanese band Loudness is played. They later covered the song and released it as a bonus track on the album &quot;Halo of Blood&quot;. The intro for track 9 is a strain of music called &quot;Hummel Gets the Rockets&quot; which was composed by Hans Zimmer and Nick Glennie-Smith for the 1996 film &quot;The Rock&quot;.

<text>The Military Order of the Stars and Bars (MOSB) is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization in the United States that is based in Nixa, Missouri. It is a lineage society founded in 1938 for men who are descended from military officers or political leaders in the Confederate States of America (CSA).

==History==
The order was founded in 1938 in Columbia, South Carolina, at a meeting attended by 17 former Confederate officers and 47 male descendants of Confederate officers. They voted to begin a new CSA veterans society to hold annual meetings and chose the name of the &quot;Order of the Stars and Bars&quot;.

The organization changed its name to &quot;The Military Order of the Stars and Bars&quot; at the 39th General Convention held in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1976. It adopted the Confederate battle flag as the official insignia of the order.

==Organization==
The executive director is called the &quot;Commander General of the Military Order of the Stars and Bars&quot;. The current executive director (as of 2022) is Jon E. Trent. The organization awards scholarships and literary awards for books about Confederate history.

At the initiation of new members and at the beginning of meetings, members pledge to &quot;commemorate and honor the service of leadership these men rendered&quot; and salute the Confederate flag &quot;with affection, reverence and undying devotion for the Cause for which it stands&quot;.

The group is loosely affiliated with the Sons of Confederate Veterans, another neo-Confederate group. Some people are members of both organizations. The Sons of Confederate Veterans was reported in March of 2002 to have been taken over by &quot;Neo-Confederate extremists&quot;.

<doc id="1143433" wikidata="Q1027289" url="?curid=1143433" title="O-Bahn Busway">
<text>The O-Bahn Busway is a guided busway that is part of the bus rapid transit system servicing the northeastern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. The O-Bahn system was conceived by Daimler-Benz to enable buses to avoid traffic congestion by sharing tram tunnels in the German city of Essen.

Adelaide&#x27;s O-Bahn was introduced in 1986 to service the city&#x27;s rapidly expanding north-eastern suburbs, replacing an earlier plan for a tramway extension. The O-Bahn provides specially built track, combining elements of both bus and rail systems. The track is long and includes three interchanges at Klemzig, Paradise and Tea Tree Plaza. Interchanges allow buses to enter and exit the busway and to continue on suburban routes, avoiding the need for passengers to transfer to another bus to continue their journey. Buses can travel at a maximum speed of , but are restricted to . , the busway carried approximately 31,000 people per weekday. An additional section including a tunnel opened in 2017 at the city end to reduce the number of congested intersections buses must traverse to enter the Adelaide city centre.

The development of the O-Bahn busway led to the development of the Torrens Linear Park from a run-down urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at Modbury.

==Track==
The O-Bahn track is made of concrete; it is elevated from the ground because of the poor quality of alluvial soils along the River Torrens, which frequently move due to their high level of plasticity. On top of the pylons are concrete sleepers on which the track rests. 5,600 pylons were drilled in place to support 5,600 sleepers and 4,200 prefabricated L-shaped track pieces, sited at intervals. Concrete pylons were cast into the ground to ensure stability, to a depth of up to . The width of both tracks, sitting on the sleepers, is . The O-Bahn&#x27;s concrete tracks were narrower and lighter than those of the initially proposed light rail development, and put less stress on the land. The concrete components were precast and then laid onto piers.

At the city end, the O-Bahn begins at East Terrace, as an extension eastwards from Grenfell Street into the parklands. The O-Bahn enters an tunnel, completed in December 2017, which curves from east to north, emerging onto bus lanes in the middle of Hackney Road just north of the intersection with Botanic Road and North Terrace. The bus lane continues north to the River Torrens and into the original entrance of the O-Bahn on Hackney Road, opposite the East Parklands, where it enters a tunnel at a speed limited to , due to the tight initial corner, ensuring that the rear tyres (especially trailer tyres of articulated buses) do not &#x27;scrub&#x27; against the track. Speed is gradually increased to for most of the trip to Klemzig Interchange. Once en route to Paradise Interchange, the speed limit was up to , but has been limited to since late 2012. On some sections was achieved in tests. The average service speed including stops is about . On entering interchanges the O-Bahn ends and the speed limit is . In the interchange area, the speed limit is . The O-Bahn is officially considered a road, due to a court ruling in the early years of the system&#x27;s operation. This ruling permits the South Australia Police to install speed cameras and fine speeding drivers.

Cars entering the O-Bahn are deterred by a large number of signs at entrance points and a sump buster device that rips out a car&#x27;s sump (oil pan) if it gets onto the track. An average of four cars per year enter the O-Bahn and must be removed by crane.

==Buses==

The first buses to enter service on the O-Bahn were 41 rigid and 51 articulated Mercedes-Benz O305s. These were modified for O-Bahn use by Mitsubishi Motors&#x27; Clovelly Park plant before being bodied by Pressed Metal Corporation South Australia. The cost was included in the original $98 million budget. Modified MAN SG280s and SL202s were later purchased.

With the Mercedes-Benz O305s approaching their 25-year age limit, tenders were called in 2007 for replacements. The new buses were Scania K230UB rigid and Scania K320UA articulated buses bodied by Custom Coaches. , these, along with rigid Scania K280UB/K320UB buses, articulated Scania K360UA buses, one diesel/electric hybrid Scania K320UB, and one Mercedes-Benz O405NH make up the fleet.

In the case of breakdowns, a specially designed vehicle nicknamed &#x27;Dumbo&#x27; is used to tow buses from the O-Bahn. In the early stages of design it was intended that all buses would have towing ability; however, this was soundly rejected by the drivers&#x27; union and &#x27;Dumbo&#x27; was purchased. If a tyre blows during a trip the guide-wheel prevents the bus from erratic movement, and a smaller aluminium inner tyre allows the bus to be driven to the nearest station at .

The guide-wheel, which protrudes just ahead of the front wheels, is the most important part of the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.

Since June 2018, services are operated by Torrens Transit under contract to Adelaide Metro. , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.

==Interchanges==
Klemzig Interchange is the first station, three kilometres (1.8 mi) from the city centre in the suburb of Klemzig. It was built as a connector to the city loop &#x27;Circle Line&#x27; bus service, which followed the Adelaide outer ring route. Many bus services bypass Klemzig and the station has limited capacity. It contains a park &amp; ride carpark with 450 spaces.

Paradise Interchange is the second station, six kilometres (3.7 mi) from the city centre, in the suburb of Paradise. The terminus before the completion of Stage 2, it is now served by buses from suburban streets, and has a total of 875 car parking spaces in two areas.

Tea Tree Plaza Interchange is the terminus, from the city centre, in Modbury. Adjacent to the Westfield Tea Tree Plaza, it is the largest O-Bahn station. Bus services from this interchange connect to areas as far away as Elizabeth and service the Golden Grove area. It has 700 car parking spaces, after a multiple level carpark was built during a redevelopment in 2013.

==Route==


Outbound O-Bahn bus routes travel through the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, and enter the O-Bahn via the tunnel (opened on 10 December 2017) through the Adelaide Park Lands in Rymill Park. They then exit the tunnel on Hackney Road, north of the intersection with Dequetteville Terrace, and then proceed northwards along the road in designated bus lanes. Along this stretch the Adelaide Botanic Garden is on the left, followed by Botanic Park. Hackney Road—along with the designated O-Bahn bus lanes—crosses a bridge over the River Torrens, with the bus lanes veering easterly, to the northbound entrance of the guided O-Bahn busway. The busway dips below the surface road (Park Road) to join the inbound (southbound) track, both heading northeast.

The busway follows roughly the Torrens River valley, but with smoother curves. This means that it crosses the river quite often, with either a park or a few houses on a point surrounded by the river and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches Klemzig Interchange on the north side of the river. The busway crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the busway and the river before reaching Paradise Interchange.

After Paradise Interchange, the busway passes under Darley Road, then over the Torrens for the last time. The terrain becomes steeper as the busway proceeds up along the outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the Hope Valley Reservoir. It proceeds north under Grand Junction Road, then swings east and north again to enter the eastern side of the Westfield Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre precinct, where the guided busway ends at Tea Tree Plaza Interchange. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further afield.



All listed routes connect Adelaide City Centre to the named endpoint, but service different suburbs between the O-Bahn interchange and that endpoint.

==History==
===Planning===
The greater Adelaide area experienced significant growth during and after World War II. Between 1944 and 1965, the area&#x27;s population doubled, and the number of private motor vehicle registrations increased 43-fold. In 1955, the state government under Premier Sir Thomas Playford established a Town Planning Committee and commissioned a coordinated plan to guide the future development of Adelaide. The resulting 300-page study, &quot;Report on the Metropolitan Area of Adelaide 1962&quot;, laid out a 30-year development plan, including a proposed of improved roadways. Shortly before leaving office in 1965, Playford commissioned a detailed study focusing on the recommended transportation improvements.

In 1968, the government received the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) that envisaged a network of 10 freeways crossing the metropolitan area, a rapid rail network, and an underground city loop railway. MATS drew massive public opposition, as it called for the acquisition of thousands of properties and would effectively supplant a number of suburbs that were to become the sites of interchanges. Arguments broke out in Parliament, and widespread images of gridlock in overseas freeway networks contributed to the furore. Nonetheless, in early 1969 Premier Steele Hall approved implementation of the plan in a modified format, and the government began to purchase property along the proposed corridors. In mid-1969, faced with ongoing opposition, the state abandoned plans for 2 of the 10 proposed freeways. Hall was voted out of office in 1970, and the new government under Premier Don Dunstan passed a 10-year moratorium on freeway development, effectively shelving MATS. The already-acquired corridors were retained for potential future use.

By the mid-1970s, transportation had become a problem in the north-east suburbs. The population of the Tea Tree Gully region had increased from 2,500 in 1954 to 35,000 by 1971. A corridor of land along the River Torrens from Adelaide to Modbury, originally purchased for the Modbury Freeway proposed under the MATS plan, was the subject of a new proposal in 1973 when the State Director-General of Transport suggested building a heavy rail line that would connect the suburb to the Adelaide railway system. A subsequent study, the &quot;North East Adelaide Public Transport Review&quot; (NEAPTR), considered heavy rail, light rail, busways, and freeways, ultimately concluding that a light rail line or busway would be most viable. The state government decided on a light rail proposal to extend the historic Glenelg tram line. The new route was to continue along King William Street beyond what was then the terminus in Victoria Square and weave through the Adelaide Park Lands to the Modbury corridor. The light rail system would connect with feeder buses at stations along the length of the corridor to transfer passengers to suburban routes. New light rail vehicles were to be bought to replace the ageing 1929 H type trams.

Public opposition to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan on the basis that it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.

===Development===
In search of a replacement for the light rail project, the new Government sent experts to examine an innovative guided bus system being developed in West Germany by Daimler-Benz. From the German &quot;Omnibus&quot; (bus) and &quot;Bahn&quot; (path or way, as in Autobahn for automobiles and Eisenbahn or just Bahn for railway, e.g. S-Bahn and U-Bahn), the O-Bahn system was developed for use in tram tunnels in Essen. After extensive consultations with German authorities, State Transport Authority engineers decided the O-Bahn could be used. The system was seen as far superior to previous proposals; it used less land, made less noise, was faster and cost less. In addition, its unique feature of a non-transfer service direct from suburban streets to the city centre made it more attractive. Plans were drawn up for a length of : initially only were to be constructed as O-Bahn, with the rest being conventional busway. However, safety concerns and public opposition led to O-Bahn being used for the entire length. Construction began in 1983 for the first section to Paradise Interchange. Another change of Government in 1982 resulted in uncertainty over the future of the project. The John Bannon Government, after consultations, decided to continue with Stage 1 (City to Paradise) and in 1986 proceeded with Stage 2 (Paradise to Tea Tree Plaza). The cost of the project was A$98 million, including the buses.

Stage 1 opened on 9 March 1986. Stage 2 opened on 20 August 1989.

The O-Bahn had more than 4 million passenger trips in the year after completion of Stage 1 in 1986, with a 30% increase the following year. When the completed O-Bahn was opened on 20 August 1989, passenger numbers rose another 17%. The Adelaide public transport system was privatised in the 1990s and overall patronage across all systems (bus, rail and tram) dropped 25%. The exception to this was the O-Bahn with no decrease, and there were 19,500 passenger trips daily in 1996 (7.13 million a year). , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.

===Expansion proposals===
There have been a number of proposals to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, but none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.

A southern O-Bahn proposal attracted the most attention and has been the subject of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viability since 1996. The rail route through Adelaide&#x27;s far south is off-centre, without the large catchment area of a more central transport route. An O-Bahn running direct through the region would be able to take advantage of an already large population and the continuing growth in the area.

One suggested route for an O-Bahn was for an alignment adjacent to the Noarlunga Centre railway line from the city to the Tonsley line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood Overpass would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182 million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on upgrading South Road and extending the Glenelg tram line.

There was a 2009 plan that bus routes serving the O-Bahn would be enhanced from Hackney Road along Grenfell and Currie Streets and extended to West Terrace on the far side of the CBD along dedicated bus lanes. However, the Federal Government announced in January 2011, as part of its response to the 2010–11 Queensland floods, that the extension would be cancelled &quot;as a result of a significant scope reduction of the original project, resulting in only limited transport benefits&quot;.

===O-Bahn City Access Project===
In 2015, the Department of Planning, Transport &amp; Infrastructure announced a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at Hackney Road was retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on Hackney Road now lead to a new tunnel portal with bus guide rails commencing near the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The tunnel passes under the Botanic Road intersection, then curves west under Rundle Park / Kadlitpina, Rundle Street and surfaces in Rymill Park leading to a redesigned intersection at Grenfell Street and East Terrace. Construction started in late 2015 and completed in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to McConnell Dowell in October 2015. Sage Automation provided expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and safety systems. Construction started in March 2016 with the removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. The tunnel opened on 10 December 2017, with limited services starting the next day. It started full operation on 17 December.

==Effects on local development==
The O-Bahn has caused a clustering of commercial and community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area&#x27;s easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre. Market imperatives have also been aided by the zoning of the land around the area as commercial rather than residential. The area around Tea Tree Plaza is one of five designated regional centres within the Adelaide metropolis.

According to Robert Cervero, the O-Bahn has &quot;accelerated the conversion of Tea Tree Gully from a somewhat sterile new town designed around a regional shopping mall to an emerging urban village featuring a wide range of land uses&quot;. The large Modbury Hospital is adjacent to the interchange, and the Torrens Valley campus of TAFE was built directly to the east of the busway after it opened. One government high school, three primary schools, one Christian school and three retirement villages are within a kilometre of the interchange. In contrast, there has been opposition to the area surrounding Klemzig Interchange and Paradise Interchange being used for any purpose other than low-density housing and no transit-oriented development has occurred.

==Environment==
The construction of the O-Bahn, rather than the previously proposed Modbury Freeway, was motivated by a desire to reduce car dependency. $6 million was used for the redevelopment of the Torrens Gorge, in which the Torrens Linear Park was created. About 150,000 trees, plants and shrubs were planted alongside the track for aesthetic, environmental and noise-reduction purposes; planting was completed in 1997. Walking trails and cycling paths were built along the park to encourage public use. Torrens Linear Park rejuvenated the river, which had deteriorated to the extent of being a de facto &quot;urban drain, littered with rubbish and inaccessible to the public&quot;. Arising from environmental considerations, the O-Bahn is carbon-neutral due to the absorption of carbon dioxide by the trees alongside it. The track itself is situated in a valley due to it being near a riverbed and the elevation was further lowered by digging further depressions in order to reduce the noise impact on adjacent dwellings.

The original buses ran on diesel fuel, but the system allows for buses that run on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled; as of 2014, 20% of the Adelaide bus fleet uses compressed natural gas, 48% B20 and 32% B5 biodiesel blends. The design of the O-Bahn allows for the installation of overhead wires for trolleybuses.

<text>The Robertsbridge Codex (1360) is a music manuscript of the 14th century. It contains the earliest surviving music written specifically for keyboard.

The term codex is somewhat misleading: the musical section of the source comprises only two leaves, bound together with a larger manuscript from Robertsbridge, East Sussex, England.
It contains six pieces, three of them in the form of the &quot;estampie&quot;, an Italian dance form of the Trecento, as well as three arrangements of motets. Two of the motets are from the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;. All of the music is anonymous, and all is written in tablature. Most of the music for the &quot;estampies&quot; is for two voices, often in parallel fifths, and also using hocket technique. Most likely the instrument used to play the pieces in the Codex was the organ. Formerly the date of the Codex was presumed to be around 1330, but more recent research has suggested a later date, slightly after mid-century.

The manuscript was considered Italian and connected to the main streams of the Italian trecento in its contents and in its clear use of &quot;puncti divisionis&quot; (dots of division). However, scholarly consensus now considers the source English.

The Codex is in the British Library (Add MS 28550).

Organist Charles Matthews performed Estampie in Brussels Cathedral on 7th May 2006 as part of The Spire series of concerts. A recording can be heard here: Spire Live in Brussels (Spire)

<text>USS &quot;Capitaine&quot; (SS/AGSS-336), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the capitaine, a brilliantly colored fish inhabiting waters of the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina to Panama.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Capitaine&quot; (SS-336) was launched 1 October 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. J. A. Rondomanski; commissioned 26 January 1945, Lieutenant Commander E. S. Friedrick in command; and assigned to the Pacific Fleet.

===United States Navy===
====World War II====
&quot;Capitaine&quot; got underway from New London 7 March 1945 to arrive at Pearl Harbor 15 April. On 6 May, she cleared for her first war patrol, off the coast of French Indochina north of Saigon. Enemy targets were disappointingly few for a new submarine, for the Navy had almost completely swept the sea of Japanese shipping by this time.

On 16 June, she rescued from the sea five Japanese survivors of a merchant ship previously sunk by other forces. After refueling at Subic Bay, &quot;Capitaine&quot; continued her patrol south of Borneo in the Java Sea. On 30 June, she joined in a concerted gun attack on five small enemy craft, one (Bandai Maru) which she sank after its crew had abandoned it.

Refitted at Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia, &quot;Capitaine&quot; sailed for her second war patrol, arriving in her assigned area just three days before hostilities ended.

====Post-war====
She returned to the west coast in September 1945, but in January 1946 was bound for the Far East once more, training in Philippine waters through March. A month of operations at Pearl Harbor preceded her return to San Diego, from which, after an overhaul, she made two simulated war patrols in 1947 and 1948, and conducted local training and services. The submarine was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 10 February 1950.

&quot;Capitaine&quot; was recommissioned 23 February 1957, and reported to the Pacific Fleet a month later. From her base at San Diego, she took part in training, served other fleet units as target in antisubmarine exercises, and training reservists, as well as voyaging to the Far East for 7th Fleet duty, through 1960. On 1 July 1960 &quot;Capitaine&quot; was reclassified an Auxiliary Research Submarine, AGSS-336.

In 1964 &quot;Capitaine&quot; took part in the movie &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;.

====Honors and awards====
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service
* Navy Occupation Service Medal with &quot;ASIA&quot; clasp

=== Italian Navy ===
&quot;Capitaine&quot; was decommissioned, 4 March 1966 and transferred (loaned) to Italy, 5 March 1966, where she was recommissioned in the Italian Navy as &quot;Alfredo Cappellini&quot; (S 507). She was sold to Italy and struck from the US Naval Register, 5 December 1977, and disposed of.

== Fiction related to &quot;Capitaine&quot; ==
The fictional submarine USS &quot;Triggerfish&quot; in the 1951 movie &quot;Submarine Command&quot; has &quot;Capitaine&quot;″s hull number (SS-336).

<text>Randolph Carter is a recurring fictional character created by H. P. Lovecraft. The character first appears in &quot;The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot;, a short story Lovecraft wrote in 1919 based on one of his dreams. An American magazine called &quot;The Vagrant&quot; published the story in May 1920. Carter appears in seven stories written or co-written by Lovecraft, and has since appeared in stories by other authors.

Carter shares many of Lovecraft&#x27;s personal traits: He is an uncelebrated author whose writings are seldom noticed. A melancholy figure, Carter is a quiet contemplative dreamer with a sensitive disposition, prone to fainting during times of emotional stress. He can also be courageous, however, with enough strength of mind and character to face and foil the horrific creatures of the Dreamlands, as described in the stories of the Dream Cycle.

==Stories==
In Lovecraft&#x27;s writings, Carter appears or is mentioned in the following tales, listed in the fictional chronology.
== Fictional biography ==
Randolph Carter is an antiquarian and one-time student of the fictional Miskatonic University. Based on clues from various stories, he was probably born around 1874 and grew up in and around Boston. At the age of nine, he underwent a mysterious experience at his great-uncle Christopher&#x27;s farm and thereafter exhibited a gift of prophecy.

He is the descendant of Sir Randolph Carter, who had studied magic during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Sir Randolph had then emigrated to America and his son Edmund Carter later had to flee the Salem witch-trials. Carter also had an ancestor involved in one of the Crusades, who was captured by the Muslims and learned &quot;wild secrets&quot; from them.

Carter served in the French Foreign Legion during the First World War, and was badly wounded in fighting near Belloy-en-Santerre in 1916, presumably during the Battle of the Somme in which the Legion participated. Poet Alan Seeger perished there in the Foreign Legion on the first day of the Somme, and Lovecraft may well have had Seeger in mind; Lovecraft penned a poem to Seeger&#x27;s memory in 1918.

&quot;The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot; is narrated in flashback by Carter while being interrogated by the police, who suspect him of murdering Harley Warren. Carter and his friend Harley Warren investigate a mysterious crypt in an ancient abandoned cemetery. Warren believes the crypt may contain evidence that could confirm some of his speculations (details of these speculations are never revealed, but it is said that Warren recently read a mysterious book written in an unknown language about incorruptibility of the dead). Upon reaching the cemetery, Carter and Warren uncover the crypt by lifting an immense granite slab, revealing a set of stone steps leading downward into the earth. Warren insists that Carter remain at the surface. He descends the steps alone, but remains in communication with Carter via a portable telephone set. Shortly thereafter he tells Carter that he has discovered a monstrous unbelievable secret and pleads with his companion to replace the stone and run for his life. When Carter asks what he has found, his queries are initially met with silence and then by the voice of an unknown entity who informs him that Warren is dead. The story is almost verbatim from one of Lovecraft&#x27;s nightmares, with but minor changes like the name &quot;Lovecraft&quot; to &quot;Carter&quot;.

&quot;The Unnamable&quot; begins with Carter in conversation with his friend Joel Manton, principal of a New England high school, discussing the supposedly mythical creature that bears the story&#x27;s name. The tale is set in a 17th-century cemetery as evening falls. Initially, Manton is skeptical and ridicules Carter for thinking that such a being may be possible. As darkness encroaches—and as Carter&#x27;s descriptions become more detailed and supported by facts—his flippant dismissal gradually gives way to fear. The two are attacked by the monster but survive the experience. &quot;The Unnameable&quot; is notable for containing extensive quoted dialog between the characters, something which Lovecraft scarcely used at all in the rest of his fiction.

There is some question as to whether &quot;The Unnamable&#x27;s&quot; protagonist is in fact &quot;Randolph&quot; Carter; he is named only as &quot;Carter&quot; and described as an author of weird fiction. An oblique reference to this incident is found in &quot;The Silver Key&quot;.

&quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;—one of Lovecraft&#x27;s longest tales—follows Carter for several months searching for the lost city of his dreams. The story reveals Carter&#x27;s familiarity with much of Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional universe. Carter is also shown to possess considerable knowledge of the politics and geography of the dream world and has allies there. After an elaborate odyssey, Carter awakens in his Boston apartment with only a fleeting impression of the dream world he left behind, though he now knows what the lost city actually is.

&quot;The Silver Key&quot;—perhaps the most overtly philosophical of Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction—finds Carter entering middle age and losing his &quot;key to the gate of dreams.&quot; No longer is Carter able to escape the mundane realities of life and enter the Lovecraftian dreamworld that alone has given him happiness. Wonder is gone and he has forgotten the fact that life is nothing more than a set of mental images, where there is no fundamental distinction between dreams and reality and no reason to value one above the other. In an attempt to recover his lost innocence, Carter returns to his childhood home and finds a mysterious silver key, which allows him to enter a cave and magically emerge again in the year 1883 as a child, full of wonder, dreams, and happiness. He remains in this condition until 1928, when he again disappears, presumably having found a way to transcend space and time and travel in other dimensions.

&quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key,&quot; written in collaboration with Lovecraft admirer E. Hoffman Price, details Carter&#x27;s adventures in another dimension where he encounters a more primordial version of himself (implied to be Yog-Sothoth) who explains that Carter—and indeed all beings—are ultimately nothing more than manifestations of a greater being. Carter&#x27;s mind ends up trapped in the body of an alien, another facet of the higher being. The investigation into Carter&#x27;s disappearance takes place four years later, in 1932.

&quot;Out of the Aeons&quot; by Lovecraft and Hazel Heald features a brief 1931 appearance by Carter, while trapped in the alien body. He visits a museum exhibiting an ancient mummy from a long-forgotten civilization and recognizes some of the writing on the scroll that accompanies it.

* &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;: here Carter is, presumably, twenty years old. This is the &quot;first&quot; of Carter&#x27;s stories (See &quot;The Silver Key&quot; section).
* &quot;The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot;: here Carter&#x27;s age is unspecified, but the events are set after &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;.
* &quot;The Unnamable&quot;: This story occurs shortly after &quot;The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot;.
* &quot;The Silver Key&quot;: here Carter is thirty, but in the story he finds himself transformed into a nine-year-old boy. Then, at fifty-four, he finds the Silver Key. 
* &quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key&quot;: sequel to &quot;The Silver Key&quot;.

&quot;An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia&quot; doesn&#x27;t mention anything about the chronology of &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; or &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot;. Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi used the chronology Lovecraft gives in &quot;The Silver Key&quot; in which the events in &quot;The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot; took place when Carter was in his late forties. Joshi says it would also explain why he was called a &quot;bundle of nerves&quot; in that story, since it took place after his World War I service in which he was nearly killed and might still have post-traumatic stress disorder.

== Real-life influences ==

Lovecraft&#x27;s character may have been based on a real-life Randolph Carter, who was a Scholar at Christ&#x27;s College, in the University of Cambridge, from 1892 to 1895. Carter took his Part I Tripos in Oriental Studies (Arabic), and his Part II in Egyptology. While at Cambridge, he was an acquaintance of Sir James George Frazer, author of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;. Carter&#x27;s whereabouts after Cambridge are unclear, but, like his fictional namesake, he may have used the French Foreign Legion as a route into exploring the North African deserts. College records do not indicate whether Carter was a US or British citizen.

<text>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath is a Horror novella by American writer H. P. Lovecraft. Begun probably in the autumn of 1926, the draft was completed on January 22, 1927 and it remained unrevised and unpublished in his lifetime. It is both the longest of the stories that make up his Dream Cycle and the longest Lovecraft work to feature protagonist Randolph Carter. Along with his 1927 novel &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot;, it can be considered one of the significant achievements of that period of Lovecraft&#x27;s writing. &quot;The Dream-Quest&quot; combines elements of horror and fantasy into an epic tale that illustrates the scope and wonder of humankind&#x27;s ability to dream.

The story was published posthumously by Arkham House in 1943. Currently, it is published by Ballantine Books in an anthology that also includes &quot;The Silver Key&quot; and &quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key&quot;. The definitive version, with corrected text by S. T. Joshi, is published by Arkham House in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels&quot; and by Penguin Classics in &quot;The Dreams in the Witch-House and Other Weird Stories&quot;.

==Plot==
In his dreams, Randolph Carter sees a majestic city, but is unable to approach it. After the third time the city appears in his dreams, he prays to the gods of dream to reveal the city&#x27;s whereabouts, but then the city vanishes from his dreams altogether. Undaunted, Carter resolves to beseech the gods in person at Kadath, the mountain above which the gods of dream live. In dream, Carter consults priests in a temple that borders the Dreamlands. They tell Carter that nobody knows the location of Kadath, and warn him of great danger should he continue with his quest to reach the city and suggest that the gods purposefully stopped his visions.

Carter&#x27;s knowledge of Dreamlands customs and languages makes his quest comparatively less risky than if done by an amateur, but he must consult entities with a dangerous reputation. The Zoogs, a race of predatory rodents, direct him to Ulthar to find the priest Atal. In the cat-laden city of Ulthar, Atal mentions a huge mountainside carving of the gods&#x27; features. Carter realizes the gods&#x27; mortal descendants will share those features and presumably be near Kadath. While seeking passage there, Carter is kidnapped by turbaned slavers, who take him to the moon and deliver him to horrible moon-beasts, the servants of malevolent god Nyarlathotep. The cats of Ulthar, Carter&#x27;s allies, rescue him and return him to a port city.

After a long journey, Carter finds the carving, recognizing the visage of the gods in traders who dock at Celephaïs. Before he can act on his knowledge, faceless, winged creatures called nightgaunts capture him and leave him to die in the underworld. Friendly ghouls, including Carter&#x27;s friend Richard Pickman, assist him in returning to the surface by sneaking through the terrible city of the man-eating Gugs. After assisting the cats in repelling a Zoog sneak attack, Carter buys passage to Celephaïs and learns from the sailors that the traders come from Inganok, a cold and dark land devoid of cats.

Carter meets Celephaïs&#x27; king, his friend Kuranes, who became a permanent resident of the Dreamlands upon his death in the waking world. Longing for home, he has dreamed parts of his kingdom to resemble his native Cornwall. Kuranes knows the pitfalls of the Dreamlands well but fails to dissuade Carter from his quest. Under the pretense of wishing to work in its quarries, Carter boards a ship bound for Inganok. As they draw near, Carter spots a nameless island from which he hears strange howls. At a breathtaking summit near a quarry, Carter is captured by a merchant he had previously encountered. Monstrous birds fly them over the Plateau of Leng, a vast tableland populated by Pan-like horned humanoid beings.

Carter is brought to a monastery inhabited by the dreaded High Priest Not to Be Described. There, Carter learns that the Men of Leng are the slavers who captured him, and had worn turbans to conceal their horns. He also learns that the nightgaunts do not serve Nyarlathotep, as is commonly supposed, but Nodens, and that even Earth&#x27;s gods fear them. Carter recoils in horror as he realizes the masked high-priest&#x27;s true identity. Carter flees through maze-like corridors, wandering through the monastery in pitch-black darkness until he chances on the exit.

After rescuing several ghouls from the Men of Leng, Carter and the ghoul reinforcements attack a moon-beast outpost on the nameless rock. In a nearby city, Carter obtains the services of a flock of nightgaunts to transport himself and the ghouls to the gods&#x27; castle on Kadath. After a long flight, Carter arrives at Kadath but finds it empty. A great procession led by a pharaoh-like man arrives. The pharaoh reveals himself as Nyarlathotep and tells Carter that the city of his dreams is the childhood memories of his home city of Boston. The gods of earth have seen the city of Carter&#x27;s dreams and made it their home, abandoning Kadath and their responsibilities. 

Impressed with Carter&#x27;s resolve, Nyarlathotep grants Carter passage to the city to recall the gods of earth, but Carter realizes too late that the mocking Nyarlathotep has tricked him, and he is being taken to the court of Azathoth at the center of the universe. At first believing he is doomed, Carter suddenly remembers that he is in a dream and wakes. Nyarlathotep broods over his defeat within the halls of Kadath, mocking in anger the &quot;mild gods of earth&quot; whom he has snatched back from the sunset city.

== Characters ==
Lovecraft included elements and characters from previous stories, many of which had been influenced by Lord Dunsany, in &quot;Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;, though they are not always depicted consistently.
* Randolph Carter has the ability to enter the Dreamlands, an alternate dimension accessible through dreams. He appears in several other Lovecraft stories: &quot;The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot;, &quot;The Unnamable&quot;, &quot;The Silver Key&quot;, and &quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key&quot;. He is modeled after the author himself and represents his philosophical views.
* Richard Upton Pickman appears as a ghoul. The character first appeared in &quot;Pickman&#x27;s Model&quot; (1927), in which he was still a living human artist. He is reported to have disappeared with his family&#x27;s copy of the Necronomicon in 1926 in Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;History of the Necronomicon&quot;.
* The priest Atal appears as a boy and youth in two earlier tales, &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Other Gods&quot; (1933), respectively, which fully describe places and events alluded to in &quot;The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;.
* Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, is frequently mentioned in Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos tales, but his appearance here is the only time during which Nyarlathotep interacts meaningfully with any of Lovecraft&#x27;s human characters. Nyarlathotep also appears in the sonnet cycle &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot;.
* Nodens (an Elder God) is also described in &quot;The Strange High House in the Mist&quot;. Fritz Leiber wrote that the gods in Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction are typically depicted as &quot;either malevolent or, at best, cruelly indifferent&quot;. Nodens is an exception to this, which Leiber says could be an attempt to explain why the more malevolent gods have not overrun humanity.
* Kuranes was introduced in the short story &quot;Celephaïs&quot; (1920), as a person who abandoned his earthly life in favor of the Dreamlands.

==Inspiration==
Like Lovecraft&#x27;s novel fragment &quot;Azathoth&quot; (1922, published 1938), &quot;The Dream-Quest&quot; appears to have been influenced by &quot;Vathek&quot;, a 1786 novel by William Thomas Beckford that &quot;is similarly an exotic fantasy written without chapter divisions&quot;. Critics such as Will Murray and David E. Schultz, in fact, have suggested that &quot;The Dream-Quest&quot; is in effect a second attempt at completing the abandoned novel &quot;Azathoth&quot;.

While the influence of the fantasies of Lord Dunsany on Lovecraft&#x27;s Dream Cycle is often mentioned, Robert M. Price argues that a more direct model for &quot;The Dream-Quest&quot; is provided by the six Mars (&quot;Barsoom&quot;) novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs that had been published by 1927. It&#x27;s been noted, however, that there is little in common between John Carter, a classic action hero, outstanding warrior and rescuer of princesses, and Randolph Carter, a melancholy figure, quiet and contemplative, who never actually fights any of his enemies, is captured several times, and needs his friends to rescue him again and again. Elsewhere, Price maintains that L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) was also a significant influence on &quot;The Dream-Quest&quot;, pointing out that in both books the main character chooses in the end to return &quot;home&quot; as the best place to be.

&quot;An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia&quot; cites Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Marble Faun&quot; and &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot; as influences.

==Reception==
&quot;The Dream-Quest&quot; has evoked a broad range of reactions, &quot;some HPL enthusiasts finding it almost unreadable and others... comparing it to the &quot;Alice&quot; books and the fantasies of George MacDonald.&quot; Joanna Russ referred to &quot;The Dream-Quest&quot; as &quot;charming... but alas, never rewritten or polished&quot;.

Lovecraft himself declared that &quot;it isn&#x27;t much good; but forms useful practice for later and more authentic attempts in the novel form.&quot; He expressed concern while writing it that &quot;Randolph Carter&#x27;s adventures may have reached the point of palling on the reader; or that the very plethora of weird imagery may have destroyed the power of any one image to produce the desired impression of strangeness.&quot;

In 1948, Arthur C. Clarke sent Lord Dunsany a copy of &quot;The Arkham Sampler&quot; containing part of &quot;The Dream-Quest&quot;. Dunsany responded: &quot;I see Lovecraft borrowed my style, &amp; I don&#x27;t grudge it to him&quot;.

<text>Aditya Chopra (born 21 May 1971) is an Indian film director, producer, screenwriter and studio executive who works in Hindi cinema. He is the Chairman of India&#x27;s multi-national film, media, and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films (YRF). The films he has produced make him one of the highest grossing Indian film producers of all time.

Having denied Chopra admission into the National School of Drama due to his severe stammering as a young applicant, the Film Division of India eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2004, 2007 and 2015. Widely regarded as the most influential executive in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra&#x27;s son and the chief executive of Yash Raj Films.

==Early life ==
Chopra, the elder son of late filmmaker Yash Chopra and Pamela Chopra, was born on 21 May 1971. His only sibling is actor and producer , Uday Chopra. He is the nephew of film producers B.R. Chopra and Yash Johar, and the cousin of filmmakers Karan Johar and Ravi Chopra. &quot;He completed his secondary education at&quot; &quot;Bombay Scottish School,&quot; &quot;earning his Indian Certificate of Secondary Education.&quot;&quot; He graduated from Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics, along with Anil Thadani, Karan Johar and Abhishek Kapoor.

== Filmmaking career ==
Chopra started his film-making career at the age of 18 as an assistant director, working with his father on films such as &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989), &quot;Lamhe&quot; (1991) and &quot;Darr&quot; (1993). He also wrote his first screenplays for his father&#x27;s &quot;Parampara&quot; (1992) and his mother&#x27;s independently produced film &quot;Aaina&quot; (1993), which was the only film not directed by his father that he was an assistant director on.

=== 1995: Directorial debut and success ===
Chopra, after gaining a respectable amount of experience, started independently at the age of 23 with the all-time blockbuster romantic comedy-drama &quot;Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&quot; (1995), with Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for which he was the director and writer. The film was scripted by Chopra and produced by his father Yash Chopra, under the YRF banner. Chopra started work on the script of the film in 1990, at the age of 19, and gradually spent time making about five drafts of the film&#x27;s original script. Chopra even managed to convince his brother Uday Chopra and Karan Johar, both aspiring filmmakers, to enter the film industry as assistant directors with the film. Chopra once said that the presence of his relatives during the making of the film worked as a huge emotional support. &quot;Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&quot; eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of all time and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the Filmfare Award for Best Film, in addition to the Filmfare Award for Best Director for Chopra.

=== 1996–2002: Extensive work in Yash Raj Films ===
Chopra eventually went on to write the dialogues and the story of his father&#x27;s 1997 musical romance &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot;, (which won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment), also made under YRF. His next film as a director was the musical romantic drama &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000) starring Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai, and also launched his brother Uday Chopra into the film industry. The film was also written and co-produced by Chopra and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, earning Chopra his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. The next film under the banner was the romantic comedy &quot;Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai&quot; (2002), which released in June 2002, starring his brother Uday alongside Tulip Joshi, Bipasha Basu and Jimmy Sheirgill. The film did moderately well at the box office. The studio&#x27;s final release that year was the romantic drama &quot;Saathiya&quot;, a remake of the Tamil film &quot;Alaipayuthey&quot;, which starred Vivek Oberoi opposite Rani Mukerji. The film proved to be a major hit at the box office.

=== 2004: Breakthrough in production ===
In 2004, Chopra produced the romantic comedy &quot;Hum Tum&quot;, the action thriller &quot;Dhoom&quot; and the epic love saga &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (for which he was also the screenwriter) under the YRF banner. All three films went on to become major critical and commercial successes, earning more than (unadjusted for inflation) in the worldwide market. The films became the sixth, third and highest-grossing Indian films of 2004. The company won most of the Indian film awards in the year, with &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; also winning the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.

Chopra then produced and wrote several other highly critically and commercial successful films over the years, namely &quot;Bunty Aur Babli&quot;, &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot;, &quot;Fanaa&quot;, &quot;Dhoom 2&quot; and &quot;Chak De India&quot; (which also won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment).

Chopra also made his third film as a director in 2008 with the romantic comedy &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; starring Shahrukh Khan and launching newcomer Anushka Sharma. The film received mixed reviews upon release, but emerged as one of the highest-grossing films for Khan and YRF at that time, earning in the worldwide market. The film earned Chopra his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director.

YRF launched a number of budding screenwriters and directors under their banner throughout these years. Directors and screenwriters such as Karan Johar (his &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; was co-produced and released by Yash Raj Film Distributors), Kunal Kohli, Kabir Khan, Sanjay Gadhvi, Jaideep Sahni, Siddharth Anand, Shimit Amin, Habib Faisal, Shaad Ali, Maneesh Sharma and Vijay Acharya debuted under YRF and have gone on to become independent entities in films. The company also produced films for filmmakers such as Anil Mehta and Pradeep Sarkar under their banner. The company was eventually ranked at Number 1 (among the most successful film production companies in India) in a survey conducted by Filmfare and at number 27 (among the most successful film production companies in the world) in a survey by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, both under the vice-chairmanship of Chopra.

=== Return to film direction: &quot;Befikre&quot; (2016) ===
In September 2015, YRF announced Chopra&#x27;s directorial comeback with the romantic comedy &quot;Befikre&quot;, scheduled for a December 2016 release. In October 2015, it was announced that Ranveer Singh and Vaani Kapoor were cast in the lead roles. In December 2015, YRF announced that the music of the film will be produced by Vishal–Shekhar and Jaideep Sahni, both of whom would return to collaborate with YRF after roughly 9 years. The film marked Chopra&#x27;s directorial comeback 8 years after &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; (2008). A theatrical trailer of the film was released at the Eiffel Tower and across social media platforms in the month of October. The film was budgeted at (including print and advertising costs) and released across 2900 screens worldwide on 9 December 2016. It opened to widespread negative reviews across platforms and faced heavy losses to its business because of the currency demonetisation implied by the Government of India a few days prior to its release. The film managed to gross after a two-week theatrical run at the global box office, failing to manage break-even business for YRF.

==Career as studio executive==
In 2004, Chopra started producing under the YRF banner. He produced &quot;Hum Tum&quot;, &quot;Dhoom&quot; and &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (for which he was also the screenwriter), all three films went on to become critical and commercial blockbusters, earning more than (unadjusted for inflation) in the worldwide market. The films became the sixth, third and highest-grossing Indian films of 2004. The company won most of the Indian film awards in the year, with &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; also winning the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.

The company saw an all-time low, with several of their high-budgeted films not doing well at the box office, despite favourable critical reviews and the company thereby suffering losses amounting to millions from 2007 to 2010. The films broke YRF&#x27;s perfect success ratio and were oddly released one after another. Some of the most unsuccessful films produced under the banner were &quot;Jhoom Barabar Jhoom&quot;, &quot;Laaga Chunari Mein Daag&quot;, &quot;Tashan&quot;, &quot;Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic&quot;, &quot;Roadside Romeo&quot;, and &quot;Pyaar Impossible&quot;. Chopra then took over as the Vice Chairman of Yash Raj Films in 2010, soon after the release of the film &quot;Badmaash Company&quot; under the same banner.

Chopra has produced several commercially viable projects including off-beat content not necessarily fitting into the realm of &quot;masala films&quot;. Chopra is the first to move towards the film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is completed at YRF Studios (co-founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra is chief executive. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences by the Producers Guild of America. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe. 

== Legal issues and controversies ==
=== &quot;Ghajini&quot; ===
Photographers of the Indian media caught a glimpse of the extremely-reclusive Chopra on 27 December 2008. Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; and Aamir Khan&#x27;s &quot;Ghajini&quot; were the two big Indian releases of the year 2008 and were pitted against each other by the press; &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; was to release on Diwali and &quot;Ghajini&quot; was to release on Christmas, with a gap of a few weeks between them. Chopra was present at a private screening of &quot;Ghajini&quot; that was held by Khan, for members of the film industry. Chopra was seen leaving through the back entrance of the theatre premise around 2 am, just before the end credits of the film. On spotting multiple journalists outside the venue, he reportedly panicked and desperately sprinted towards his car to avoid being photographed. Chopra pulled down the sun visor of his car and drove away.

=== Acquisition by Walt Disney ===
The Walt Disney Company entered India in 2007 through a co-production agreement (&quot;Ta Ra Rum Pum&quot;, &quot;Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic&quot;, and &quot;Roadside Romeo&quot;) with YRF. Disney&#x27;s move was seen as a bid to increase its global presence and enter Indian entertainment. This was followed by Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, Universal Pictures, and 20th Century Fox, who made similar moves.

Post the release of the three films, Disney attempted a hostile takeover of YRF in December 2009. The offer was pushed after its acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel from the previous year. YRF however fought the offer and continued as a domestic entity, heavily aided by the Tata Sons. This was followed by the exits of Dick Cook from Walt Disney and Sanjeev Kohli from YRF. In June 2011, Disney acquired UTV at to establish Disney-UTV. Records from the Registrar of Companies of the same year showed that YRF received investments from LIC of India, Catamaran Ventures, and Maruti-Udyog.

In December 2016, Disney-UTV announced a temporary closure of its offices. After the release of its final film in July 2017, Disney exited all film operations in India and was permanently liquidated. In January 2019, YRF reached a valuation by SEBI, thereby making it the largest Indian film production company of all time.

=== &quot;Son of Sardaar&quot; ===
In 2012, Ajay Devgan, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Eros International together moved the Competition Commission of India against Yash Raj Films and Aditya Chopra, accusing the company of using monopolistic business practices and rampantly abusing their dominant position and clout in the Entertainment Industry of India by entering into a tie-in arrangement with 1,500 single screen film exhibitors (out of a total of 2,100) of India, that obliged them to showcase the company&#x27;s &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; (and not &quot;Son of Sardaar&quot;) on the Diwali week of 2012 and continue its theatrical run for two weeks after the worldwide release. The trio eventually moved the Competition Appellate Tribunal on 30 October 2012 against YRF but were turned down by the bench heading the Tribunal.

Both films opened on 13 November 2012; &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; released on 3500 screens and &quot;Son of Sardar&quot; released on 2000 screens, in the worldwide market. However, in November 2013, the CCI dismissed the case filing as they found YRF to not be in contravention of the Competition Act of India; YRF won the case.

=== &quot;Raees&quot; ===
&quot;Raees&quot; (2017) was a film produced by Excel Entertainment and Red Chillies Entertainment helmed by Rahul Dholakia. Principal photography of the film was completed in April 2015 and a few months were allotted to its post-production work. A teaser/trailer of the film was released across social media platforms and attached to &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; on 17 July 2015 announcing it as a 5 July 2016 release; packaged and presented as an Eid project. However, sensing an opportunity in the same period, YRF went ahead to green-light its own &quot;Sultan&quot;, slated for release on the same day, in January 2016. Principal photography with Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma was completed in 3 months followed by post-production work being completed in May. A teaser/trailer and other marketing material featuring both Khan and Sharma were released simultaneously starting in April across platforms and networks. The film was ready for a 5 July release and as a result, around 4230 theatre screens available in India would have been divided among the two films.

Realising a loss in business to both films, Ritesh Sidhwani and Shahrukh Khan, the producers of &quot;Raees&quot; approached Chopra to work out a settlement to ensure both projects are exhibited comfortably across centres. However, Chopra disagreed to shift his release date stating the poor performance of Khan&#x27;s prior releases (&quot;Dilwale&quot; and &quot;Fan&quot;) in the global box office. Moreover, Chopra ensured that YRF Distributors (his film distribution leg) exhibit &quot;Sultan&quot; to more than 3100 screens (out of the total 4230), apparently abusing his dominant position and clout in the Entertainment Industry of India, an allegation that he has battled several times in the past.

&quot;Sultan&quot; eventually released on 6 July 2016, as planned by YRF, across 4310 Indian screens and 1130 screens internationally, to gross in the worldwide market and &quot;Raees&quot; was postponed to 26 January 2017, scheduled to release alongside &quot;Kaabil&quot; on the same day.

=== &quot;Paani&quot; ===
In November 2012, YRF green-lit their first Indian-American war drama co-production titled &quot;Paani&quot; with DreamWorks Pictures. The film was to be helmed by Shekhar Kapur and Sushant Singh Rajput was signed for the lead role in December of the same year. Principal photography was to start in June 2013, and it was planned as a December 2015 release by both Chopra and Kapur. A. R. Rahman was roped in to score the music of the film and pre-production work started in January 2013 with the entire cast and crew at YRF Studios.

In February 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali offered the lead role to Rajput in his Shakespearean tragic romance &quot;Ram-Leela&quot;, which was scheduled to be shot throughout the year 2013. Chopra, however, advised Rajput to turn down the role to focus solely on &quot;Paani&quot; and led Bhansali to sign Ranveer Singh (through YRF Talent) instead. In November 2013, Chopra shelved &quot;Paani&quot; stating affordability issues faced by YRF during pre-production work. &quot;Ram-Leela&quot; meanwhile opened to overwhelming critical and box office success in the same period with both Bhansali and Singh being awarded extensively for their work.

Rajput was later signed for another independent YRF projects; &quot;Detective Byomkesh Bakshy&quot; scheduled to release in April 2015.

=== &quot;Pathaan&quot; ===
On 12 December 2022, YRF released a song from the fourth project of its spy universe titled &quot;Besharam Rang&quot; across all media platforms. Picturised on Deepika Padukone and Shahrukh Khan in the outskirts of Benicàssim, the song was written by Vishal–Shekhar and Kumaar. Choreography and direction was by Vaibhavi Merchant. A few days after release of the song, it started gaining criticism among right-wing ideologists for its lyrics, Padukone&#x27;s appearance in a saffron bikini, and Khan&#x27;s appearance in green trousers. A boycott call on Twitter by the name &quot;#BoycottPathaan&quot; began to trend with a section of users calling the visuals &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;infuriating&quot;.

Chopra wrote to the Office of the Prime Minister explaining this issue a week before the release of the film. On 18 January 2023, the Prime Minister of India sent out a warning to the workers of all national political parties to &quot;strictly refrain from making comments on films&quot;. It was the first-ever public statement strategically released by the PMO to safeguard the release of a film in India. The Ministry for Information and Broadcasting further cautioned political leaders and workers against making remarks on important films. Followingly, the state governments of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam assured YRF protection for its viewers and assurance that protestors will be strictly prosecuted. On 24 January 2023, a day before the release of the film, the Vishva Hindu Parishad released a statement to its members that they were &quot;satisfied&quot;&quot;&quot; with the certification of the film and assured that all protests will be ceased.

At the time of the statement, &quot;Pathaan&quot; was slated to be screened in 5500+ movie theatres in India and 2500+ movie theatres in more than 100 countries internationally thereby making it the most widely released Indian film. After two days of its release, 25 additional screens were added after the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court directed Chopra to add an exclusive version of the film for people with disabilities.

On 3 March 2023, &quot;Pathaan&quot; emerged as the third highest grossing Hindi film of all time.

==Personal life==
He was married to Payal Khanna until their divorce in 2009. The couple had no children. On 21 April 2014, he married actress Rani Mukerji in a private ceremony in Italy. In December 2015, Rani gave birth to their daughter Adira Chopra.

In 2023, Chopra sat down for an extensive interview for the first time in 28 years for the Netflix series &quot;The Romantics&quot;, which highlights the rise of Yash Chopra and Yash Raj Films.

<text>The Mayor of Christchurch is the head of the municipal government of Christchurch, New Zealand, and presides over the Christchurch City Council. The mayor is directly elected using a First Past the Post electoral system. The current mayor, Phil Mauger, was elected in the 2022 mayoral election. The current deputy mayor is Pauline Cotter.

Christchurch was initially governed by the chairman of the town council. In 1868, the chairman became the city council&#x27;s first mayor as determined by his fellow city councillors. Since 1875, the mayor is elected by eligible voters and, after an uncontested election, the first election was held in the following year.

==History==

===Chairmen of the Town Council===

Christchurch became a city by Royal charter on 31 July 1856; the first in New Zealand. Since 1862, chairmen were in charge of local government. Five chairmen presided in the initial years:

===Mayors of the City Council===

The town council held a meeting on 10 June 1868 to elect its first mayor. In those days, councillors were elected for three-year terms, and once a year elected one of their group as mayor, i.e. the position was not elected at large (by the voting public) as is the case today.

The following councillors attended the 10 June meeting: William Wilson, James Purvis Jameson, T. Tombs, George Ruddenklau, Henry Thomson, W. A. Sheppard, William Calvert and John Anderson, who chaired the meeting. Thomson moved that Wilson be elected as the first mayor of Christchurch, and Tombs seconded the motion. The chairman put the motion to the meeting and it was carried unanimously. With the meeting, the council had brought itself under the Municipal Corporations Act 1867.

Hence, the last chairman (William Wilson) became the first mayor in 1868. The first chairman (John Hall) became mayor 44 years later in 1906. There have been 46 holders of the position. The longest-serving was Sir Hamish Hay, who held the post for 15 years (5 terms). The shortest mayoralty was by Tommy Taylor in 1911, who died three months after being elected. Wilson&#x27;s term, at just over six months, was the second shortest. Vicki Buck and Lianne Dalziel, have been the only female mayors so far.

Initially, councillors elected one of their own as mayor towards the end of the year, and the role was usually awarded to the most senior councillor. Most elections were unanimous, and the newly elected mayor was instantly regarded as the head of the council. The system changed with the introduction of The Municipal Corporations Acts Amendment Act, 1875, as that legislation stipulated that mayors had to be elected at large (i.e. by eligible voters). Fred Hobbs, the incumbent, was the only candidate nominated, so he was declared elected unopposed on 17 December 1875. James Gapes was the first mayor elected at large on 20 December 1876. The newly elected person was from that point the mayor-elect, until he was sworn in; Gapes was sworn in on 2 January 1877. Despite this, Taylor&#x27;s death in 1911 resulted in councillors electing their fellow councillor John Joseph Dougall as mayor as required by the legislation for such cases.

Mayors were initially appointed and then elected for one year; elections started following the Municipal Corporations Act of 1876. This was changed to biennial elections &quot;on the last Wednesday in April&quot; with the Municipal Corporations Amendment Act, 1913. The act came into force in March 1915 and thus first applied at the April 1915 mayoral election. The Municipal Corporations Act, 1933 changed the mayoral term to three years, and this commenced with the 1935 mayoral election.

Five mayors have held non-consecutive terms:
* James Gapes
* Walter Cooper
* Charles Louisson
* Charles Gray
* Robert Macfarlane

==Recent mayors==

Four former mayors are alive:
* Vicki Buck (1989–1998)
* Garry Moore (1998–2007)
* Bob Parker (2007–2013)
* Lianne Dalziel (2013–2022)

==List of mayors==
==List of deputy-mayors of Christchurch==

The position of deputy mayor was established in 1917. In the first meeting of the newly elected council on 7 May 1917, Alfred Williams was the first city councillor to be elected to the position. Five deputy-mayors were later elected as mayors: John Beanland, James Flesher, Dan Sullivan, Ernest Andrews, and George Manning. Four deputy-mayors were mayors before they served as deputies: Henry Thacker, John Archer, Robert Macfarlane, and Vicki Buck. Since October 2022, the current deputy mayor is Pauline Cotter, who is representing the Innes ward.

<doc id="1143564" wikidata="Q15516400" url="?curid=1143564" title="Tony Ruprecht">
<text>Tony Ruprecht (born 12 December 1942) is a former Canadian politician. His first elected position was as an alderman in the old Toronto City Council, in the late 1970s. He became a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1981, and served in premier David Peterson&#x27;s cabinet as minister without portfolio from 1985 to 1987. Ruprecht represented Toronto&#x27;s Parkdale and then Davenport constituencies for the Liberal Party of Ontario for 30 years. On 5 July 2011, he announced that he was leaving politics and would not seek re-election in the October 2011 provincial election.

==Background==
Ruprecht moved to Canada with his family in 1949 after attending school in Germany. He was educated at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario (receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969), Wichita State University (1971) and Miami University, doing Ph.D. work at the latter institution from 1971 to 1973. He taught in the Political Science department at York University, teaching public administration and municipal governance.

He has authored two books: &quot;The Graduate School Game&quot; (1976) and &quot;Toronto&#x27;s Many Faces&quot; (1990) now in its 5th edition. The latter book being an overview of Toronto&#x27;s multicultural communities. Ruprecht is also a member of the Knights of Malta. He has received a number of honours from Portugal, Poland, Estonia and the Philippines.

==Toronto alderman==
Ruprecht made his foray into politics by seeking the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s nomination in the federal Parkdale electoral district, for the 16 October 1978 by-election. He lost the nomination to future Toronto mayor, Art Eggleton. He began his political career at the municipal level, when alderman Tony O&#x27;Donohue decided to run for mayor in the 1978 Toronto municipal election. His mayoral campaign meant that he would not seek re-election in his Ward 2 seat, in the Parkdale and Brockton part of Toronto&#x27;s west-end. Ruprecht decided to run for the vacant alderman position in August. On 13 November 1978, he was elected as one of the Ward&#x27;s two alderman from a field of ten candidates. By receiving the most votes, he became the senior alderman for Ward 2 on Toronto City Council and Metropolitan Toronto Council. He won re-election as the senior alderman in the 10 November, 1980 Toronto municipal election.

==Provincial politics==

===Parkdale constituency (1981–1999)===
Ruprecht was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1981 provincial election, representing the Parkdale constituency. He defeated incumbent New Democratic Party MPP, Jan Dukszta, by nearly 1,000 votes. Ruprecht was re-elected by a much greater margin, of almost 7,000 votes over the next candidate, in the 1985 election.
The Liberals formed government after the election, and on 26 June 1985, Ruprecht was appointed as a minister without portfolio responsible for Disabled Persons and Multiculturalism. He was re-elected by a landslide the 1987 election, but was subsequently dropped from cabinet.

The Liberal government called an early election and were defeated by the New Democratic Party (NDP), who formed the government following the 1990 provincial election. Ruprecht managed to retain Parkdale by 523 votes over NDP candidate Sheena Weir, even though most surrounding constituencies were won by the NDP on 6 September 1990. On 8 June 1995, he was re-elected by a greater margin in the 1995 election, as the NDP lost much of its support throughout the province. The Progressive Conservatives won the provincial election, and Ruprecht remained in opposition serving as critic for Citizenship. During his years on the Opposition bench Ruprecht also served variously as Critic for Tourism, Disabilities and Associate Critic for Labour.

In 1996, Ruprecht was the only Liberal MPP outside of Ottawa to support Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s bid for party leader prior to the actual leadership convention. McGuinty was chosen leader after five ballots.

===Davenport constituency (1999–2011)===
Due to Premier Mike Harris&#x27; Progressive Conservative government changing Ontario&#x27;s provincial electoral district boundaries to match the federal ones for the 1999 Ontario general election, the Legislature was reduced to 103 seats, from 130. This boundary change meant that the previous constituencies were redistributed into several of the new ones and incumbent MPPs would have to decide where they would stand for re-election as their old constituencies no longer existed. Ruprecht initially planned to run in the newly created Parkdale—High Park constituency in the 1999 provincial election, but stood aside for star candidate Gerard Kennedy. Kennedy was forced to step aside for former leadership rival Joseph Cordiano in the newly created York South–Weston constituency, because Liberal party leader McGuinty&#x27;s policies dealing with redistribution and sitting MPPs was to give the senior MPP first choice, and Cordiano was the more senior of those two. Instead, Ruprecht ran in the neighbouring Davenport constituency. It contained the eastern portion of his old Parkdale constituency. He was not appointed as the Liberal candidate, as he had to defeat human-rights lawyer Rocco Galati, at a nomination meeting on 21 July 1998, before he could run in the election. There was a controversy over the nomination process, and Galati unsuccessfully sued the Liberal party, the constituency association, and Ruprecht.

Ruprecht&#x27;s main opponent in the 1999 campaign was another displaced incumbent MPP, the NDP&#x27;s deputy leader, Tony Silipo. What the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; dubbed &quot;The battle of the Tonys&quot; was expected to be a very close race between Silipo and Ruprecht. Election night, 3 June, was anticlimactic, as Ruprecht easily won with a 4,932 vote plurality. The Progressive Conservatives managed to lose all their seats in the old city of Toronto, but nevertheless, won the provincial election, and Ruprecht remained in opposition.

Ruprecht was elected for a seventh time in the 2003 election, defeating NDP candidate Jordan Berger by over 8,000 votes on 2 October 2003. The McGuinty-lead Liberals formed government following this election after having been in Opposition for 13 years. Despite being the only MPP outside of Ottawa to support McGuinty&#x27;s leadership campaign, Ruprecht was not appointed to cabinet, but he was appointed vice-chair of the legislature&#x27;s Standing Committee on Regulations and Private Bills.

In April 2006, Ruprecht was criticized for being absent from the Ontario legislature for extended periods of time while vacationing in Cuba. The MPP acknowledged that since the previous fall he had made four trips to Cuba for a cumulative period of seven weeks. He defended these trips saying he was travelling to the island to receive lessons in Spanish and Portuguese in order to better be able to communicate with his constituents.

In the 2007 provincial election, Ruprecht&#x27;s margin was reduced to less than 2,000 votes. On 5 July 2011, he announced that he was not running for re-election and would retire. He made this decision, partially because of the unexpected death of fellow Liberal MPP, Bruce Crozier, stating &quot;I have not groomed a successor (in Davenport) simply because Bruce’s death shocked me.&quot; The Liberals lost his seat in the ensuing provincial election on 6 October 2011.

<text>Canadian Stage is a Canadian non-profit contemporary theatre company, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 

==History==
The company was founded in 1988 with the merger of Centre Stage and Toronto Free Theatre. Canadian Stage has produced more than 300 shows - over half of which have been Canadian plays. Canadian Stage also runs a series of development, education, and outreach programs.

At the end of the 2008-2009 season, Martin Bragg stepped down as artistic producer. At the time of his resignation, Bragg had been with the company for 17 years, and was the company&#x27;s longest serving artistic director. He cited a desire to pursue other opportunities and spend time with his family as reasons for his departure.

In 2010, Canadian Stage partnered with York University&#x27;s Faculty of Fine Arts to develop an MFA in Theatre – Stage Direction program, which officially launched in 2011. Designed to train directors for large-scale theatrical productions, the program requires students to direct a Canadian Stage production and complete an internship.

In 2023, the &quot;Dream in High Park&quot;, the company&#x27;s series of William Shakespeare plays presented in an open-air amphitheatre, celebrated its 40th anniversary.

== Leadership ==
The Canadian Stage Company is led by an Artistic Director and an Executive Director, as well as a Board of Directors. The current artistic director is Brendan Healy. The current executive director is Monica Esteves, who has been in the role since 2018.

=== History of artistic directors ===
* Bill Glassco (1988-1990)
* Guy Sprung (1990-1992)
* Bob Baker (1992-1998)
* Martin Bragg (1998-2009)
* Matthew Jocelyn (2009-2018)

Canadian Stage presents performances at three venues: the 876-seat Bluma Appel Theatre; the Berkeley Street Theatres (244-seat Berkeley Downstairs Theatre and the 167-seat Berkeley Street Upstairs Theatre); and a 1,000-seat outdoor amphitheatre in Toronto&#x27;s High Park, where Shakespeare is performed each summer.

The company&#x27;s main stage, The Bluma Appel Theatre, is located in the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts (a city of Toronto-owned building), at 27 Front Street East. The theatre has been Canadian Stage&#x27;s home for over 25 years. The St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts was constructed in the late 1960s as part of the city&#x27;s Centennial Celebrations. Originally named &quot;The Theatre&quot; when it opened in February 1970, it was renovated by the Thom Partnership in 1982.

The Berkeley Street Theatre complex contains two performance spaces, as well as a rehearsal space, props and wardrobe facilities, and the company&#x27;s administrative offices. The Berkeley site was originally built by the Consumer&#x27;s Gas Corporation in 1887 as part of a gas pumping station complex. The Berkeley Downstairs Theatre was originally a pump room and served in that capacity until 1955, when Consumer&#x27;s Gas moved their production out of downtown Toronto. A wrecking firm was hired to demolish the buildings in February 1971, but the complex was renovated instead. The Berkeley Upstairs Theatre was created as part of the general 1976 renovations of the complex. This building is also owned by the City of Toronto.

Situated in the middle of Toronto&#x27;s High Park, the amphitheatre can seat over 1,000 people. The first production of Shakespeare in High Park was performed in 1983 without a stage. The City of Toronto terraced the hillside of the Amphitheatre to provide seating in 1997. A permanent stage was installed in 2005.

==Awards==

Canadian Stage is a three-time recipient of the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Award for the Arts, in recognition of building private sector and community support. Canadian Stage has been nominated for 296 Dora Mavor Moore Awards, receiving 62.

<doc id="1143567" wikidata="Q7839786" url="?curid=1143567" title="Tri-ang Railways">
<text>Tri-ang Railways was a British manufacturer of toy trains, one of the elements of the Lines Bros Ltd company who traded using the brands Tri-ang, Minic, Pedigree, and Frog. The Tri-ang Railways name was dropped a few years after Lines Bros took over the Hornby name although the majority of the trains were still the original Tri-ang models.

==History==

===Tri-ang name===
Brothers George and Joseph Lines made wooden toys in the Victorian age, their company being G &amp; J Lines Ltd. Joseph was the active partner while George went into farming. Joseph (or Joe) had four sons. Three of these – William, Walter and Arthur Edwin Lines – formed Lines Bros Ltd shortly after World War I. Three &quot;Lines&quot; make a triangle, hence the Tri-ang. Arthur&#x27;s son, Richard Lines, was largely responsible for the Tri-ang Railways system.

===Foundation of Tri-ang Railways===
Rovex Plastics Ltd was founded just after World War II in 1946 by Alexander Gregory Vanetzian, who made toys for Marks &amp; Spencer. Venetzian was asked to develop an electric toy train set for Christmas 1950. He delivered the product but, although the company had found larger premises in a former Brewery in Richmond, it was constrained financially. Lines Bros were looking to expand into railways and so they purchased Rovex. Their products would be sold under the Tri-ang Railways name from 1951. To give room for development they moved the company, now Rovex Scale Models Ltd, to a brand new factory built at Margate, in Kent, in 1954.

A battery powered plastic 0 gauge range called the Big Big train was sold from 1966 to 1972. Some, but not all of the moulds from these were later sold and used by other manufacturers including Novo in the USSR and Lima in Italy.

As well as 00/H0 gauge, Tri-ang made TT gauge models from 1957 to at least 1967. The 3mm Society supports those who still model Tri-ang TT.

J. H. Doyle, Managing Director of Rovex Scale Models joined Rovex Plastic Ltd in its early days. His responsibilities within Tri-ang were the development of the OO/HO range and he was &quot;a prime mover in starting and promoting&quot; the TT gauge.

Tri-ang also manufactured a garden railway system called Tri-ang Minic Narrowgauge Railway, thus being known as TMNR. This was a 10.25&quot; gauge passenger carrying system using 2 rail electric pick-up with motors running at 40 volts DC. This was produced in the early 1960s and not a commercial success, with less than 90 &#x27;sets&#x27; being produced.

===Expansion and name changes===
The success of Tri-ang meant that British competitors Trix and Hornby Dublo were affected. In 1964, Hornby Dublo, a division of Meccano Ltd, had stopped production and Meccano Ltd invited Lines Bros. Ltd to buy them out. Tri-ang purchased the company including a large amount of stock. The combined toy railway was marketed as Tri-ang Hornby. Production of the Tri-ang models continued and a supplementary catalogue was published in May 1966 to show both Tri-ang and Hornby Dublo items. The Lines Bros empire itself collapsed in 1971 and was broken up. The model railways, then marketed as Tri-ang Hornby, were sold to the Dunbee-Combex-Marx group, but the rights to the Tri-ang brand were sold elsewhere; accordingly, the Hornby name being established and recognised, from 1 January 1972 the model railways were rebranded Hornby Railways.

===Models===

In April 1963, Railway Modeller reviewed the ex-L.N.E.R. B12 locomotive which had the new Magnadhesion, with magnets close to the wheels, to improve traction with Tri-ang steel track.

===Australian and New Zealand models===
A number of Tri-ang models specific to Australia were produced by Moldex in Melbourne during the 1960s, including:
* NSW 1955-type suburban electric motor car and driving trailer car.
* Victorian B class double-ended diesel locomotive in &#x27;Transaustralia&#x27; livery.
* A blue version of NSW 1955-type suburban cars pretending to be a Victorian EMU was planned but never produced

Other models were manufactured in Auckland, New Zealand, and were mainly the same as those made in England, although there were variations.

Some Super-4 track was produced in Australia.

The Australian and New Zealand models were produced in 00 gauge only.

=== Canadian train sets and models ===
Lines Bros. (Canada) Ltd. was originally incorporated on 24 March 1947.  The trademark used in Canada was that of the thistle which had first been registered by Joseph Lines, the co-founder of G. &amp; J. Lines Ltd., in 1910. The main factory and warehouse facility was located at 4000 St. Patrick Street, Montreal, Quebec. The Canadian company struggled to make acceptable profits and it was thought that profits could be increased with a wider range of toys to market. The Tri-ang Railways Transcontinental range of models was devised specifically with this in mind and by Christmas 1954 the first sets began to appear in the shops.

However, the models were produced too quickly, without sufficient attention to detail and lacked realism.  Without proper consideration to what the Canadian market demanded, the models were not popular although they sold well enough in the UK. Historically, standard train sets were imported into Canada from the UK; initially only the Transcontinental range of models. However, between 1957 and 1974, a number of sets were produced exclusively for the general Canadian market as well as some special sets commissioned by department store chains and / or mail order companies; including Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears, Eaton’s, Woodward’s and the Hudson’s Bay Company. No models were made in Canada but the Canadian company assembled a wide range of sets from both boxed and unboxed models sent out to them from the Margate factory.

From 1965 a new full-colour Canadian catalogue was produced, where previously the UK catalogue had been used and supplemented (up until 1962) by an illustrated price list.

Initially, a number of Canadian National Railway (CNR) models were introduced specifically for the Canadian market. Later, in 1967 models representing the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) began to appear. Of note were the representations of the transcontinental passenger trains which have become firm favourites with collectors of Tri-ang Railways.

===South African models===
A limited number of models were manufactured in Durban, South Africa. These are very rare.

<doc id="1143571" wikidata="Q1016871" url="?curid=1143571" title="Burnt Weeny Sandwich">
<text>Burnt Weeny Sandwich is the seventh album by the American rock band the Mothers of Invention, and the ninth overall by Frank Zappa, released in 1970. It consists of both studio and live recordings. Following the Mothers&#x27; split in late 1969, Zappa assembled two albums of unreleased recordings by the band - this album and its follow-up &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;. &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; focuses mostly on studio recordings and tightly arranged compositions, while &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; focuses mostly on live recordings and loose/improvisational pieces. Both albums also include some outtakes/leftovers from the sessions for Zappa&#x27;s 1969 solo album &quot;Hot Rats&quot;.

The LP included a large triple-folded black and white poster (&quot;The Mothers of Invention Sincerely Regret to Inform You&quot;) which has never been reproduced in any of the CD reissues (except the Japanese Ryko mini-lp sleeve editions).

== Title ==
The album&#x27;s unusual title, Zappa would later say in an interview, comes from an actual snack that he enjoyed eating, consisting of a burnt Hebrew National hot dog sandwiched between two pieces of bread with mustard.

In 1975, &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; and &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; were reissued together as &quot;2 Originals of the Mothers of Invention&quot;, with the original covers used as the left and right sides of the inner spread, and the outer gatefold cover depicting a revolver shooting toothpaste onto a toothbrush.

== Album information ==
The album was essentially a &#x27;posthumous&#x27; Mothers release having been released after Frank Zappa dissolved the band.

Ian Underwood&#x27;s contributions are significant on this album. Like its counterpart &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;, this comprises tracks from the Mothers vault that were not previously released. Whereas &quot;Weasels&quot; mostly showcases the Mothers in a live setting, much of &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; features studio work and structured Zappa compositions, like the centerpiece of the album, &quot;Little House I Used to Live In&quot;, which consists of several movements and employs compound meters such as with overlaid melodies in and . The ending section of &quot;Little House&quot; features an organ solo played by Zappa with the band at Whitney Studios in Glendale, California.

The guitar solo portion of the &quot;Theme from Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; is an outtake from an unused extended version of &quot;Lonely Little Girl&quot; from the 1967 sessions for the &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; LP. Zappa and Art Tripp later added multiple percussion overdubs for the released version (The source recordings for the percussion overdubs were issued in 2012 on the posthumous Zappa release &quot;Finer Moments&quot; under the title &quot;Enigmas 1–5&quot;).

&quot;Igor&#x27;s Boogie&quot; is a reference to a major Zappa influence, composer Igor Stravinsky.

Cal Schenkel has noted that his unique cover art for &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; was originally commissioned for the cover of an Eric Dolphy release.

The piano introduction of &quot;Little House I Used to Live in&quot; appears in Yvar Mikhashoff&#x27;s four CD set &quot;Yvar Mikhashoff&#x27;s Panorama of American Piano Music&quot;.

<text>The Southern Cross Cable is a trans-Pacific network of telecommunications cables commissioned in 2000. The network is operated by the Bermuda-registered company &quot;Southern Cross Cables Limited&quot;. The network has of submarine and of terrestrial fiber optic cables, all which operate in a triple-ring configuration. Initially, each cable had a bandwidth capacity of 120 gigabit/s. Southern Cross offers capacity services from 100M/STM-1 to 100 Gbit/s OTU-4, including 1G, 10G and 40G Ethernet Private Line services.

==History==
In April 2008 this capacity was doubled, and was once again upgraded to 860 gigabit/s at the end of 2008. Southern Cross upgraded the existing system to 1.2 Tbit/s in May 2010. After successful trials of 40G technology the first 400G of a planned 800G upgrade has been completed in February 2012, and the remaining 400G was completed in December 2012. 

An additional 400G was deployed utilizing 100G coherent wavelength technology in July 2013, taking total system capacity to 2.6 Tbit/s, with an additional 500 Gbit/s to be deployed per segment by Q2 2014, increasing total system capacity to 3.6 Tbit/s. About every two or three years, the Southern Cross Company makes an effort to upgrade the cables in some way or another. In June 2014 a further 900 Gbps was added. The system currently runs at circa 10Tbs employing a mix of 100Gbs, 200Gbs and 250Gbs wavelengths.

==Spying and interception==

In 2013 the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that the owners of the Southern Cross cable had asked the United States National Security Agency to pay them for mass surveillance of New Zealand internet activity through the cable. In May 2014, John Minto, vice-president of the New Zealand Mana Party, alleged that the NSA was carrying out mass surveillance on all meta-data and content that went out of New Zealand through the cable.

In August 2014, Russel Norman, New Zealand Green Party co-leader, stated that an interception point was being established on the Southern Cross Cable. Norman said that as the cable is the only point of telecommunications access from New Zealand, this would allow the Government to spy on all phone calls and internet traffic from New Zealand. Norman&#x27;s claims followed the revelation that an engineer from the NSA had visited New Zealand earlier in the year to discuss how to intercept traffic on the Southern Cross cable.

The office of John Key, New Zealand Prime Minister, denied the claims but admitted that they were negotiating a &quot;cable access programme&quot; with the NSA but refused to clarify what that was or why the NSA was involved.

== Damage incidents ==

There have been few incidents damaging sections of the Southern Cross Cable, despite it traversing the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s Ring of Fire and its long length.

In late 2007, Southern Cross Cable&#x27;s operations vice president, Dean Veverka, confirmed that hurricane strength storms and flooding had wiped out the carrier&#x27;s Oregon cable route and halved its bandwidth capability between Australia/New Zealand/Fiji and United States for a short period of time, albeit customer services were restored via the systems alternate path. A Southern Cross customer (iiNet) said that emergency works have been organised to perform a more permanent fix for the damage to the cable. These works were performed on 3 February 2008 at 12 midnight AEST.

In March 2008, the then head of Telecom Wholesale, Matt Crockett, mentioned to the National Business Review that there had been a recent undersea earthquake that impacted a shunt on the Southern Cross Cable. However, due to the Cable&#x27;s redundancy and spare capacity, users experienced no change in access or speed.

==Construction and ownership==
Construction of the cable began in July 1999, laid by the ship CS &quot;Vercors&quot;, and the system was in use by customers by November 2000. Additional works and upgrades have since taken place to increase the network&#x27;s capacity to 480 Gbit/s. In August 2007, SC Cables contracted with Alcatel-Lucent to upgrade the cable to 660 Gbit/s by the end of the first quarter 2008 and to 860 Gbit/s by the end of 2008, with future upgrade also by Alcatel-Lucent to 1.2 Tbit/s in May 2010. The cable has since been upgraded to over 10Tbs of capacity with a further &gt;10Tbs of capability available on the existing system. The Southern Cross NEXT system will add a further 72Tbs of capability to the network by the end of 2021.

The cable was a private investment and there was in estimated $1.5 billion spent on the initial system development. The company is owned by Spark New Zealand, SingTel/Optus, Telstra (as of December 2019) and Verizon Business. The cables are the result of an agreement between companies Spark Trading, Optus, MFS Globenet, and Southern Cross. The agreement was reached between the companies in 1997 as a response to unexpected growth of the internet that created a need for a submarine cable link connecting the West Coast and Australasia.

== Southern Cross NEXT ==

Southern Cross NEXT is a new route addition to the Southern Cross cable eco-system. This new addition began construction in 2019 and was forecast to be completed by 2022. When finished, the new link will be the largest capacity data link between Sydney, Auckland, and Los Angeles at . The cable is predicted to cost around $300 million and is owned by the Southern Cross group of companies. When finished, Southern Cross NEXT will be able to carry up to 72 terabits per second. 

The NEXT cable will not be marketed as a stand-alone cable, but rather is designed to be an extension of the original Southern Cross network. The Southern Cross group companies are funding this new segment, through debt and equity arrangements, with the Australian Telecommunication company, Telstra, entering as a new shareholder of the Southern Cross companies. Spark New Zealand announced that Telstra was becoming a 25% stakeholder in the cables in August 2019, at the same press conference they announced that Southern Cross NEXT was fully approved.

Southern Cross NEXT entered service in July 2022. The cable starts from the Clovelly in Sydney to Los Angeles, where it will give carriers lower latency connections between Australia and the US. Branching units on the way link New Zealand, Fiji (to the islands of Suva and Savusavu), Kiribati and Tokelau.

==Interconnected cables==

A number of Pacific Island cables interconnect with Southern Cross, including the Tonga Cable System, the Interchange Cable System to Vanuatu, the TUI-Samoa cable linking Samoa to Fiji, and the Gondwana-1 system linking Australia to New Caledonia. The Honotua cable system links French Polynesia to the Southern Cross system in Hawaii.

<doc id="1143590" wikidata="Q7975459" url="?curid=1143590" title="Waverly, Pennsylvania">
<text>Waverly is a census-designated place (CDP) comprising the central community within Waverly Township in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. Originally called Abington Center, it was founded in the late 18th century by settlers from Connecticut, along the Warriors&#x27; Path. The population in 2024 according to World Population Review was 504, declining at a rate of -1.37% annually.

==Geography==
Waverly is in northwestern Lackawanna County and occupies the north-central part of Waverly Township. It is bordered to the northwest by the borough of Dalton, to the west by Glenburn Township, and to the northeast by North Abington Township. Pennsylvania Route 632 passes through Waverly, as Carbondale Road to the east of the center of town and as Clinton Street to the west. PA 632 leads east to Interstate 81 and west to the center of Dalton. Pennsylvania Route 407 (North Abington Road) crosses PA 632 in the center of Waverly and leads north to Fleetville and south to Clarks Green. Scranton is south of Waverly.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Waverly CDP has an area of , of which , or 0.08%, are water. The community drains west via Ackerly Creek and other streams to the south branch of Tunkhannock Creek, which flows west to the Susquehanna River.

== History ==
The earliest settlers built cabins in Waverly around 1800. The Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike (now Main Street) was chartered in 1819 by the Pennsylvania Legislature along the Warriors&#x27; Path. Started in 1820, this turnpike was completed in 1824. During this time, the first three houses which were not cabins were built. In 1828, the Wayside Inn was built, and the first doctor, Andrew Bedford, set up practice and built a house which stands today on Main Street. The first general store was built in 1830, followed by a second inn and tavern in 1832. A building boom ensued during the years 1847 through 1890, during which time Waverly was a profitable small-scale industrial center. 1850 through 1880 was the heyday of Waverly&#x27;s industrial era. Farmers and dairymen shipped their goods to New York City; iron foundries flourished, and numerous retail establishments, including greengrocers, bakers, a drugstore, dime store, hardware store, lumberyard, and harness shops, thrived. In 1880, the railroad was laid to the west of Waverly, and the prosperity of the town faded.

During the mid-19th century, Waverly was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Escaped slaves and freedmen found a sympathetic population in Waverly, and some settled in small houses built by a local farmer and sold to them. The freedmen also built the AME Church, which is in use today as a private residence. It is one of five churches in existence in 1872, three of which still stand and are still active congregations.

== Education ==
The school district is Abington Heights School District.

The first school was started in his log cabin in 1804 by Elder Miller, the first settler in the town. The first dedicated school was built in 1830 on the Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike. After it ceased being used as a school, it became a private residence for many years; the Waverly Historic Society is currently planning for its renovation and use as their headquarters. In 1844, a group of investors started the Madison Academy. This was a private school which enjoyed high regard and taught a rigorous curriculum to boys and girls. Students came from all over Pennsylvania to attend the Madison Academy; some of its graduates became judges and attorneys. The tuition ranged from $2.00 to $10.00 per quarter, depending upon the grade, and the boarding house next door charged $1.25 to $1.50 per week. Following the closing of the private school in 1878, the building was used as a public school through 1925, at which time it was razed. The Belin family donated a new school building to the town that originally served all grades. The site of that school is now occupied by a newer building, Waverly Elementary, which serves kindergarten through fourth grade and is part of the Abington Heights School District, ranked 57th in the state of Pennsylvania according to US News.

The bell from the Madison Academy hangs behind Waverly Elementary, a testament to the long tradition of academic excellence in Waverly. Although the academy was razed, the house across the street from it has a bell in its attic and is sometimes mistaken for the original Madison Academy.

== Fire in 1916 ==
In the spring of 1916, a fire devastated the four downtown blocks of Waverly; only 11 businesses remained thereafter. Of those, two buildings have operating businesses in them today: The Waverly Deli and The Waverly General Store. The front two blocks were an eyesore, although summer visitors continued to come from Scranton to Waverly. The Belin family bought the front two blocks and began design and construction of the Waverly Community House. The building was completed in 1920, and expanded to the back two blocks of the original downtown; all streets through those blocks had been removed, and the transformation of downtown to picturesque center was complete.
The Community House (commonly referred to as &quot;The Comm&quot;) sits at the center of Waverly. The brick Dutch colonial structure currently houses the Waverly Post Office, a gymnasium with basketball court, a public playground, a preschool program and numerous recreational and educational offerings for families with young children. The Comm also plays host to an annual home and garden show, antique fair, and concerts on the lawn. Margaretta E. Belin funded construction of The Comm as a memorial to her husband, Henry Belin Jr., after his death in 1917. On June 4, 1920, the building and a portion of the land were deeded to Abington Township for the benefit of the township&#x27;s residents. Wealthy summer visitors from Scranton migrated to Waverly on a permanent basis, and the town&#x27;s reputation as a white-collar bedroom community was cemented.

*Mary Scranton, former First Lady of Pennsylvania (1963–1967)

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 400, commonly referred to as Highway400, historically as the Toronto–Barrie Highway, and colloquially as the400, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario linking the city of Toronto in the urban and agricultural south of the province with the scenic and sparsely populated central and northern regions. The portion of the highway between Toronto and Lake Simcoe roughly traces the route of the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, a historic trail between the Lower and Upper Great Lakes. North of Highway 12, in combination with Highway 69, it forms a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH), the &quot;Georgian Bay Route&quot;, and is part of the highest-capacity route from southern Ontario to the Canadian West, via a connection with the mainline of the TCH in Sudbury. The highway also serves as the primary route from Toronto to southern Georgian Bay and Muskoka, areas collectively known as &quot;cottage country&quot;. The highway is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police and has a speed limit of , except for the section south of Highway401, where the speed limit is and the stretch between MacTier and Nobel, where the speed limit was raised to on April 22, 2022.

Although part of the Trans-Canada Highway only over the portion between Highway 69 and Highway 12, the full route of Highway 400 is part of the broader National Highway System.

It was the first fully controlled-access highway in Ontario when it was opened between North York and Barrie on July1, 1952. On that date, it was also the first highway to be designated as a 400-series. The freeway was extended in both directions; north of Barrie to Coldwater in 1958, and south of Highway401 to Jane Street in 1966; a short distance east of Jane Street the route continues as the municipal expressway Black Creek Drive which opened in 1982. Since the 1970s to the present there have been numerous projects which have widened and modernized the freeway between North York and Barrie, including being expanded with a collector-express system in Vaughan to accommodate the interchange with the new Highway407 ETR.

Highway400 is the second longest freeway in the province, the trans-provincial Highway 401 being the longest. Since 1977, construction on the freeway has been snaking north along Highway69 towards Parry Sound and Sudbury. As of 2011, a four lane freeway is opened as far north as Carling; at that point, the four lanes narrow into two and continue northerly to Sudbury as Highway69. At the north end of Highway69, a segment of freeway is in operation from near Highway 522 south of the French River to Sudbury; while this section will be part of the completed Highway400 route, at present it remains signed as Highway69. The remaining gap between Carling and Highway 522 will be opened in stages as construction is undertaken and completed.

== Route description ==
While Highway400 was originally known as the Toronto–Barrie Highway, the route has been extended well beyond Barrie to north of Parry Sound, and is projected to reach its eventual terminus in Sudbury in the 2020s.
, the length of the highway is with an additional planned.

Highway400 begins at the Maple Leaf Drive overpass in Toronto, south of Highway401. South of that, the route continues as the municipal Black Creek Drive, an arterial road or limited controlled-access expressway with at-grade intersections, originally planned as a southern extension of Highway 400. Alongside the expansion of Highway401, Highway400 had been completed to Jane Street in 1966, but a proposed southern extension to the Gardiner Expressway faced opposition that also caused the truncation of Allen Road, so it was instead built as the scaled-back Black Creek Drive which opened in 1982. South of Highway401, all on-ramps to the southbound lanes of Highway400 are signed as Black Creek Drive (without reference to Highway400) even though Black Creek Drive does not start until Maple Leaf Drive.

North of Maple Leaf Drive, the highway shifts northwestward as it meets Jane Street at a five-ramp parclo interchange, with the Black Creek river snaking under the highway and on/off ramps. The segment between Maple Drive and Jane Street, including the bridges crossing Black Creek and the ramps to/from Jane Street, were built during the Black Creek Drive project although it is under provincial jurisdiction. The highway then turns approximately northward as it approaches the interchange with Highway401, and although only two lanes per direction pass though that junction, the on-ramps from Highway401 become additional lanes for the highway&#x27;s northbound carriageway widening the cross-section to twelve lanes. The opposite occurs on the southbound carriageway of the highway where four lanes default to off-ramps for Highway401 eastbound and westbound, while the rightmost lanes continue the highway through that junction (signed as Black Creek Dr. and Jane St.). The on-ramp from Highway401 eastbound to Highway400 northbound has rumble strips to encourage drivers to adhere to the recommended speed limit of 50 km/h.

The highway continues north, losing two lanes at the Parclo A4 interchange with Finch Avenue. Crossing Steeles Avenue and a railway line as it enters the Regional Municipality of York, the freeway has a junction with Highway407 which is the only four-level stack interchange in the Greater Toronto Area; unusually the entry/exit for Highway407 are before those for Steeles Avenue even though Steeles is further south; as the semi-directional ramps connecting from/to Highway407 require a longer approach due to the height of the junction. The section between Highway407 and Langstaff Road in suburban Vaughan features a short collector-express system, with the collector lanes serving interchanges with Highway7 and Langstaff Road, while the express lanes have access to Highway407. North of Langstaff Road, the freeway passes west of Vaughan Mills shopping centre and Canada&#x27;s Wonderland theme park.
From Highway401 to the Holland Marsh the freeway largely parallels the arterial/concession roads Weston Road and Jane Street, passing over the height of land at the Oak Ridges Moraine. The highway passes through protected rural areas in northern York Region and encounters rolling countryside in Simcoe County south of Barrie. Between Major Mackenzie Drive and King Road, Highway 400 features HOV lanes which have acceleration/deceleration lanes at entry/exit points. Near the King City On-Route located between Kirby Road and King-Vaughan Road, Highway 400 will meet an under-construction Highway 413. Just a bit north of the Simcoe Road88 exit, Highway400 will meet the future Bradford Bypass. The section near Barrie is subject to snowsqualls as it lies near the edge of Georgian Bay&#x27;s snowbelt.

Within Barrie, Highway400 passes through a trench which places it below grade for most of its length, the route curving around downtown Barrie towards the north-east. On the outskirts of Barrie at a partial interchange, unusually the through right-of-way continues as the start of Highway 11 which heads north-east towards Orillia and North Bay, while Highway400 routing continues via a right-hand &quot;exit&quot; to a semi-directional ramp that crosses Highway 11. The split junction is also incomplete; drivers must either use the Forbes Road and Penetanguishene Road interchanges, or continue southbound into Barrie and switch direction at Duckworth Street in order to travel from southbound Highway /11 to northbound Highway 400 or from southbound Highway 400 to northbound Highway 11. After splitting off from Highway 11, Highway400 veers 90degrees to the north-west towards Georgian Bay (onwards this segment of freeway is colloquially known as the &quot;400 Extension&quot;), travelling alongside the former Highway 93 to Craighurst.

At Craighurst the highway again turns north-east, skirting the Copeland Forest and the ski hills of the Oro Moraine, to meet Highway 12, which runs concurrently with the 400 between Exits141 and 147, in Coldwater. From here, the highway takes on the Trans-Canada Highway designation, and follows a predominantly north-western heading along what was the route of Highway69, toward the planned terminus of Sudbury. In Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts, Highway400 is in most sections a twinned four-lane highway, but several bypasses have and are being built to circumvent the communities along the way.
At Port Severn, the highway meets the rugged Canadian Shield, and winds its way north through the granite, often flanked by towering slabs of rock.

== History ==

=== Initial construction ===
Highway400, along with Highway401 and Highway402, was one of the first modern freeways in Ontario. Planning for the Toronto–Barrie Highway, which would become Highway400, began in 1944. The two routes connecting Barrie with Toronto at the time, Highway 11 and Highway 27, were becoming congested. Grading on a new alignment between Weston Road and Jane Street was completed from Wilson Avenue to Highway27 (Essa Road) by 1947. The onset of the Korean War slowed construction on the highway considerably,
and it wasn&#x27;t until December1, 1951 that two lanes (one in each direction) would be opened to traffic. All four lanes were opened to traffic on July1, 1952, at which point the highway was designated Highway 400. The name was the scorn of one newspaper editor, who published his distaste for using numbers to name a highway.
The freeway featured a grass median.

Shortly after its completion, Hurricane Hazel struck on October15, 1954. The torrential downpours caused catastrophic damage to southern Ontario, amongst which was the flooding of Holland Marsh to a depth of . Several bridges and sections of road were washed away by Hazel. The damaged highway and bridges were completely reconstructed after the water was pumped away.

=== Expansion ===

By 1958, Highway 400 was extended north parallel with Highway 93 as a two-lane &quot;super two&quot; with at-grade intersections to Craighurst and construction had begun to extend it further to connect to Highway 12 and Highway 103 south of Coldwater. Both sections opened to traffic on December 24, 1959. For many years afterwards, and still today to older drivers, this portion of the highway (or sometimes even the entire stretch to Parry Sound) north of Barrie is referred to as the &quot;400 Extension&quot;. As constructed the extension branched off from the existing highway by means of a partial interchange (since then, newer provincial construction guidelines would have mandated that the existing highway be realigned to flow directly into the extension, while providing an interchange to the section of highway that was bypassed). The extension meant bypassing a section of the original freeway that connects to Highway 11 at the Crown Hill interchange, which was then given the internal designation of Highway 400A. (Highway 400A was redesignated as part of Highway 11 on April 1, 1997, while the rest of Highway 11 south of the Crown Hill junction was downloaded to local municipalities, resulting in Highway 11&#x27;s new southern terminus being at the partial interchange with Highway 400.)

Plans were also conceived to extend the freeway south from Highway 401 to Eglinton Avenue, where it would join two new expressways: the Richview and the Crosstown Expressways, and eventually terminate at the Gardiner Expressway. These plans would never reach fruition, as public opposition to urban expressways cancelled most highway construction in Toronto by 1971.
Highway 400 would still open as far south as Jane Street on October 28, 1966,
before the rest of the plans were shelved following the cancellation of the Spadina Expressway. The province used the right-of-way in the Black Creek valley to construct a four-lane divided expressway with signalized intersections as far south as Eglinton Avenue, although there was sufficient space for a six-lane freeway with interchanges. The segment between Maple Drive and Jane Street, including the bridges crossing Black Creek and the ramps to/from Jane Street, were built as part of the Black Creek Drive project although it remained under provincial jurisdiction as the southmost section of Highway 400. Metro&#x27;s proposal to continue this route further to St. Clair Avenue was opposed by the City of Toronto, so as a compromise the expressway would end at Weston Road which in turn would be widened to support the flow of traffic from the expressway. Originally known as the Northwest Arterial Road, the expressway opened in 1982 as Black Creek Drive and was transferred to Metropolitan Toronto on March 1, 1983. In exchange, the City of Toronto was given expropriated land purchased for Spadina south of Eglinton Avenue in order to block a further southward extension of Allen Road. Had Metro not agreed to the land transfer, the province would have seized these lands and billed Metro half the cost of Black Creek Drive.

Widening of Highway 400 began in 1971. An additional lane in either direction was created by reducing the 9.1 m median by and using of the shoulder on each side. The first section to be widened was from Highway 401 to Finch Avenue, which was widened to eight lanes. Soon thereafter, the section from Finch to Highway 88 was widened to six lanes. A year later, the six lane freeway was extended north to Highway 11.

The super two north of Barrie was twinned starting in 1977, necessitated by the increasing use of the highway by recreational traffic. This work involved the construction of two southbound lanes parallel to the original, with a median between them. In addition, at-grade intersections were converted into grade-separated interchanges. This work was completed as far as Highway 93 north of Craighurst by 1982. In 1980 construction began on four-laning the section from Highway 93 to Simcoe County Road 19,
which was completed by the end of 1982. During the summer of 1983, four-laning began between Simcoe County Roads 19 and 23, bypassing west of Coldwater. This was completed during the summer of 1985. The old northern terminus of Highway400 south of Coldwater (Exit137) is today known as Lower Big Chute Road.

Between 1985 and 1987, the pace of construction slowed temporarily as the foundations for a new southbound structure over Matchedash Bay on Highway 69 (former Highway 103) just north of Highway 12 were compacted and settled. During the fall of 1987, a contract was awarded to extend the four-laning north to Waubaushene and to complete the interchange with Highway 12,
first constructed when the super two was extended from Coldwater to Waubaushene in the late 1970s.
This work was completed a year later during the fall of 1988.

In 1979-80, ramps serving the freeway south of that crossing were added to the existing Rutherford Road overpass to serve the newly-opened Canada&#x27;s Wonderland theme park. Highway400 was expanded and upgraded through Vaughan in the late 1980s and early 1990s, largely in tandem with the construction of Highway407, with a collector-express system added to separate traffic at the Highway407 interchange from access to Highway 7 and Langstaff Road.
As a precursor to the widening of Highway400, the cloverleaf interchange with Highway7 was reconfigured to a partial cloverleaf in 1987–88. The northbound lanes of Highway400 were shifted to a temporary diversion between Steeles Avenue and Highway7 in order to facilitate construction of the four-level interchange with Highway407, with the precast concrete post-tensioned bridges completed in 1990. Only the third level flyovers were immediately opened to serve Highway400 traffic, with the rest of the junction closed off for the next few years as work on Highway407 progressed.
Portions of this diversion were later retained for the ramps to and from Highway407, which opened on June 7, 1997.

=== Twinning Highway 69 ===
North of Highway 12, Highway 400 transitioned into the two-lane Highway 69. Several structures were constructed over the next few years in preparation for twinning Highway 69. In 1988 construction began on the southbound structures over Matchedash Bay and the Canadian National Railway crossing north of Highway 12. Both were complete by the end of 1990. During 1991, construction began on the interchanges at Quarry Road and Port Severn Road, new service roads between those interchanges and the southbound structure over the Trent–Severn Waterway.

Following the twinning of Highway 69 (which was not redesignated as Highway 400 until 1997, several years after completion) to Port Severn, the next target became Parry Sound. In 1988 construction began on the southbound structures over Matchedash Bay and the Canadian National Railway crossing north of Highway 12. Both were complete by the end of 1990. During 1991, construction began on the interchanges at Quarry Road and Port Severn Road, new service roads between those interchanges and the southbound structure over the Trent–Severn Waterway. In 1988, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario completed a study of the Highway 69 corridor between Muskoka Road 5 in Port Severn and Tower Road southwest of MacTier, a distance of approximately . This work was carried out through the 1990s, reaching as far as Muskoka Road 38 (former Highway 660) by 1999.
The four-laning was extended north to the Musquash River in October 1999, although an interchange wasn&#x27;t constructed at Muskoka Road 32/38 until October 2005.
However, a land claim dispute between the Government of Ontario and the Wahta Mohawks prevented the twinning of the highway between the Musquash and Moon Rivers. The Territorial Reserve did not oppose the construction; however, the land was unobtainable due to a technicality requiring a minimum voter turnout of 65percent.

Construction of the Parry Sound Bypass, a new alignment from Badger Road to the Seguin River, began with an interchange along Highway 518 at the site of the future freeway, which was completed during the autumn of 1999.
Construction south of the interchange to Badger Road started in November 1999, while the section north of the interchange to the Seguin River began three months later.

On February 7, 2000, the government officially committed to complete Highway 400 to Parry Sound. Work began on two projects as a result of this: a bypass of Highway 69 on a new alignment between the Moon River, south of MacTier, and Rankin Lake Road near Horseshoe Lake, as well as a segment connecting that to the Parry Sound Bypass.

The first segment of freeway to be completed north of the Musquash River was the Parry Sound Bypass, which opened on November 1, 2001.
This section bypassed to the east of the old highway, now known as Oastler Park Drive. However, it was numbered as Highway 69 for the moment. In October 2002, the section south of the Parry Sound Bypass to Rankin Lake Road was opened. This was followed a year later on October 7 with the opening of the bypass of Highway 69 from the Moon River to Rankin Lake Road, connecting with the Parry Sound segment. At that point, the Highway 400 designation was extended north to the Seguin River. However, the Highway 69 designation remained in place as far south as the Musquash River.

The remaining gap through the Wahta Mohawk Territory would eventually be constructed, starting in December 2004.
It opened to traffic during the summer of 2008,
completing the freeway south of Parry Sound. Since then, the Highway 69 designation has been removed south of Nobel.

=== Since 2000 ===

As one of the oldest 400-series freeways, several vintage overpasses have been demolished in recent years to accommodate the future widening of Highway 400 to ten lanes in the section from Vaughan to Barrie. Sixteen of these historic structures, sub-standard by today&#x27;s freeway requirements, remained as of summer 2009, with all slated for replacement in the near future. In order to preserve some of this heritage the Ministry of Transportation created an 1800mm x 1625mm reusable urethane mould of the provincial coat-of-arms from the 5th Line overpass located south of Bradford, which will be used to decorate the replacement structures.

The interchanges at Rutherford Road and Major Mackenzie Drive in Vaughan were extensively reconstructed to modern Parlo A4 configurations in 1993 and 2004, respectively, while a new partial interchange was added for Bass Pro Mills Drive in 2004 to serve the Vaughan Mills shopping centre. In late 2010, the Portage Road overpass crossing Highway 400 was opened. The Highway9 (Davis Drive) overpass was initially twinned with an addition span on the north side in the late 1990s, however this still permitted only six lanes of Highway400 to pass underneath, so a decade later the twin structures were replaced with a wider single bridge that was long enough to accommodate future widening of the freeway to eight lanes.
The North Canal bridges are to be replaced in order to accommodate eventual expansion of the route and increase vertical clearance over Canal Road.

Construction began north of Barrie in April 2013 to replace the overpass at the Crown Hill junction with Highway 11.
The new structure which is designed for higher travel speeds, and also long enough to accommodate future expansion of Highway 11 underneath, was completed in October 2015. The original overpass, built during the 1950s, was demolished during an overnight closure on December 13, 2015. The overall cost of this project was C$8.5 million.

On February 27, 2014, a major snowsquall affected Highway 400 in Innisfil with heavy wind gusts and near-zero visibility. A total of 96 vehicles were involved in a major collision that ensued near Innisfil Beach Road. Although no injuries were reported, the highway was closed for a day and buses were shuttled in to warm stranded motorists.

In 2017, the provincial government announced the widening of Highway 400 from Major Mackenzie Drive to King Road from 6 lanes to 8 lanes with HOV lanes. The southbound HOV lane was opened on September11, 2021, while the northbound lane opened two months later on November11.

As a precursor to the eventual reconfiguration of the Highway 89 junction, the Cookstown service centre was closed on February 1, 2013, while its replacement was shifted to a new site north of Fourth Line while being rebranded as Innisfil ONRoute and it reopened in June 2015. Construction to replace the Highway 89 overpass and realign the interchange to a parclo, with new ramps to be built in the NW quadrant where the service centre was formerly located, commenced in 2019 with an expected completion set for 2021.

== Extension towards Sudbury ==
On June 28, 2005, it was officially confirmed that Highway 69 would be twinned and bypassed north to Highway 17 in Sudbury. This announcement was accompanied by a time line with the completion date set for 2017;
in March 2015, the Ministry of Transportation acknowledged that the original completion date would not be met, and announced that its current goal is to have the project completed in the 2020s. However, work was already underway in 2003 to expand Highway 69 south of Sudbury to four lanes.
As work is completed at the southern end near Nobel, the Highway 400 designation will be extended north.

Construction began on the segment from Sudbury southwards to Estaire in 2005, while route planning studies were completed for the Estaire to Parry Sound segment. Portions of the route will be opened to traffic in segments as contracts are fulfilled; the segment between Sudbury and Estaire opened on November 12, 2009,
while the Nobel bypass from Parry Sound to Highway 559 opened October 26, 2010. As the Sudbury segment of the Highway 69 freeway is discontinuous with Highway 400, it will not be renumbered until the twinning of the intervening section is completed.

On October 27, 2010, one lane in either direction on the Nobel Bypass opened to traffic. The new four-lane bypass, which travels as far north as Highway 559, was fully opened in November. The former route of Highway 69 through the town was renamed as Nobel Drive and was reduced in width from four to two lanes, with a recreational trail constructed alongside the road.
Some businesses in Nobel were affected after the opening of the new highway 400 realignment and had to be closed down.

== Services ==
There are four service centres located along the southern section of Highway 400: Maple, King City, Innisfil and Barrie. The centres were originally leased to and operated by several major gasoline distributors; however, those companies chose not to renew their leases as the terms end. In response, the MTO put the operation of the full network of service centres out for tender, resulting in a 50-year lease with Host Kilmer Service Centres, a joint venture between hospitality company HMSHost (a subsidiary of Autogrill) and Larry Tanenbaum&#x27;s investment company Kilmer van Nostrand, which operates them under the ONroute brand.

Three of the four service centres were upgraded and feature a Canadian Tire gas station, an HMSHost-operated convenience store known as &quot;The Market&quot;, as well as fast food brands such as Tim Hortons, A&amp;W and Burger King. The southbound Vaughan service centre, which had been redeveloped in the late 1990s, was not included in these plans. The Barrie centre closed for reconstruction on October 19, 2010. The King City service centre relocated a few hundred meters south in October 2012. The Cookstown centre was located at the Highway 89 interchange being incorporated into the southbound ramp (while accessible to northbound traffic by exiting on westbound Highway 89 then turning at a driveway on the west side of the 400) and it closed on February 1, 2013, while its replacement was shifted to a new site north of Fourth Line while being rebranded as Innisfil ONRoute and it reopened in June 2015. Service centres are located at the following points along Highway 400:
North of Barrie, where average traffic volumes do not warrant large service centres with direct highway access, there are two service campuses operated by Petro Canada, both containing several fast food outlets, located on crossroads at interchanges in Port Severn (Exit 156) and Seguin Trail (Exit 214) near Parry Sound.

<text>Lorenzo Berardinetti (born 21 October 1961) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the Toronto riding of Scarborough Southwest.

==Background==
Berardinetti was born in Scarborough, and is a lawyer by profession. He attended the University of Toronto and the University of Windsor Law School, and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1988. On October 25, 2010, Berardinetti&#x27;s then-wife Michelle won election as a Toronto City Councillor. They married in 2004 and divorced in 2018. Berardinetti&#x27;s cousin is politician Michael Colle. As a child, he and Colle lived in the same house in downtown Toronto. They would later serve together as MPPs in Queen&#x27;s Park.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
Berardinetti was a councillor in the pre-amalgamation Scarborough Council from 1988 to 1996, and represented Ward 37 (Scarborough Centre) on the amalgamated Toronto City Council from 1997 to 2003. In 1997, he served as chair of Toronto&#x27;s administration committee, which created the framework for a unified civic administration in the amalgamated city. Berardinetti was generally regarded as an ally of Toronto mayor Mel Lastman during his years on the Toronto council.

===Provincial===
In the provincial election of 2003, Berardinetti defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Dan Newman by about 6,000 votes in Scarborough Southwest. The Liberals won a majority government under Dalton McGuinty in this election, and Berardinetti was appointed the deputy government whip on 23 October 2003. He was re-elected in 2007, 2011, and 2014.

In 2004, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill, to outlaw what he called &quot;gender-based pricing,&quot; whereby prices for equivalent or similar products and services, such as clothing, dry cleaning and haircuts, may vary between women and men. He contended women were charged much more for many products and services. The bill reached only second reading before it died on the order paper.

During his time in the government, Berardinetti was a Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Labour (2010-2011) and PA to the Attorney General (2011–2018).

Berardinetti lost his seat in the 2018 provincial election, finishing third in the riding of Scarborough Southwest.

==Later life==
In 2022, Berardinetti attempted to return to city politics, running for a seat on Toronto city council in the ward of Scarborough Southwest. He finished fourth in the election.

Shortly after his municipal defeat he suffered a seizure and was in a coma for a month. He could not find work after his 2018 defeat and was unable to work in the aftermath of his coma and depleted his savings as a result. He moved in with his brother in Ajax, Ontario in 2022 but left in 2023 after an argument over money and has lived in homeless shelters since then. In the summer of 2024, his neurologist gave him permission to work again and he is trying to establish a law practice. After news of his situation broke, he was able to raise over $25,000 from former colleagues across all parties, including his Progressive Conservative predecessor and New Democratic successor as MPP, Dan Newman and Doly Begum. It also led to suggestions that the MPP pension, removed in 1995 by Premier Mike Harris, be reinstated.

<text>A curette is a surgical instrument designed for scraping or debriding biological tissue or debris in a biopsy, excision, or cleaning procedure. In form, the curette is a small hand tool, often similar in shape to a stylus; at the tip of the curette is a small scoop, hook, or gouge. The verb &quot;to curette&quot; means &quot;to scrape with a curette&quot;, and curettage ( or ) is treatment that involves such scraping.

== Uses ==
Some examples of medical use of a curette include:

* the removal of impacted ear wax;
* dilation and curettage of the uterus, a gynecologic procedure;
*excision of many benign tumors and some malignant tumors;
* excision of the adenoids (adenoidectomy) by an otolaryngologist;
* to scrape tartar deposits from tooth enamel with a periodontal curette.

<text>Cape Campbell () is in Marlborough, New Zealand, on the northeastern coast of the South Island. It lies at the southern end of Clifford Bay, northeast of Ward, and southeast of Blenheim. Cape Campbell lies close to the salt works at Lake Grassmere / Kapara Te Hau.

It is the third-easternmost point of the South Island, at a longitude of about 174o16.5&#x27; East.
(The two easternmost points are West Head (it is the western shore of the opening to Tory Channel / Kura Te Au - the opposing shore being on Arapaoa Island), and Cape Jackson (between the entrances to Queen Charlotte Sound and Port Gore), both at a longitude of 174o19&#x27; east.)

It was named by Captain James Cook after Captain (later Vice-Admiral) John Campbell, who had been a strong supporter of Cook&#x27;s as Observer for the Royal Society.

The cape was chosen as the location for a lighthouse following several wrecks in the area, including that of the &quot;Alexander&quot; in 1858 in which one person drowned. The first lighthouse on the cape was lit in 1870, however the construction was soon found to be faulty and a replacement was built in 1905. The Cape Campbell Lighthouse continued to be manned until 1986, when it was fully automated.

<text>The Man Who Planted Trees (French title: &quot;L&#x27;homme qui plantait des arbres&quot;), also known as The Story of Elzéard Bouffier, is an allegorical tale by French author Jean Giono, published in 1953. 
It tells the story of one shepherd&#x27;s long and successful singlehanded effort to re-forest a desolate valley in the foothills of the Alps, near Provence, throughout the first half of the 20th century. 
It was written in French, and first published in English.
The story has become known worldwide and is seen as an inspiration for ecological regeneration brought about by man. 
In 1988, Frédéric Back won an Academy Award for the animated short film &quot;The Man Who Planted Trees&quot; (L&#x27;homme qui plantait des arbres). The film was published in two versions, French and English, and narrated respectively by actors Philippe Noiret and Christopher Plummer.

==Plot==
The story begins in the year 1913, when a young man who is the narrator was travelling alone on a hiking trip through Provence, France, and into the Alps, enjoying the relatively unspoiled wilderness. He runs out of water in a treeless, desolate valley where only wild lavender grows and there is no trace of civilization except old, empty crumbling buildings. He finds only a dried-up well, but is saved by a middle-aged shepherd who takes him to a spring he knows of.

Curious about this man and why he has chosen such a lonely life, the narrator stays with him for a time. The shepherd, Elzéard Bouffier, after being widowed, decided to restore the ruined landscape of the isolated and largely abandoned valley by single-handedly cultivating a forest, by planting acorns. He makes holes in the ground with his straight iron staff and drops into them acorns that he collected from miles away. He is also growing beech and birch saplings for planting.

The narrator leaves the shepherd, returns home, and later fights in the First World War. In 1920, shell-shocked and depressed after the war, the man returns. He is surprised to see young saplings of all forms taking root in the valley, and new streams running through it, where the trees are changing the climate. The narrator makes a full recovery in the peace and beauty of the regrowing valley, and continues to visit the region and M. Bouffier every year. He finds on one visit that Bouffier is no longer a shepherd, because of the sheep eating his young trees, and has become a bee keeper instead.

The valley receives official protection after the First World War, with the French authorities mistakenly believing that the rapid growth of the new forest is a bizarre natural phenomenon, as they are unaware of Bouffier&#x27;s selfless deeds. Over three decades, Bouffier continues to plant trees, and the valley is turned into a kind of Garden of Eden. By the end of the story, the valley is vibrant with life and is peacefully settled, with more than 10,000 people living there, not knowing they owe their happiness to Bouffier. The narrator tells one of his friends, a government forester, the truth about the new forest, and the friend also helps to protect it.

In 1945, the narrator visits the now very old Bouffier one last time. In 1947, in a hospice in Banon, the man who planted trees peacefully passes away.

==Background==
The story itself is said to have had such an inspiring effect on readers because of its symbolic value rather than its literal meaning. For the story shows how a small, sustained, selfless and consistent action of just one man can commit to restoration, growing, new development. Over decades (between 1913 and 1947), the man plants hundreds of thousands of seeds from a variety of native trees in a vast area around his cottage. As a result, the barren, arid region is revived and eventually his work is noticed and protected by the government.

Many readers believed that Elzéard Bouffier was a genuine historical figure and that the narrator of the story was a young Jean Giono himself, and that the tale is part autobiographical. Giono did live during this time, and while he was alive Giono enjoyed allowing people to believe that the story was real, and considered it as a tribute to his skill. His daughter, Aline Giono, described it as &quot;a family story for a long time.&quot; However, Giono himself explained in a 1957 letter to an official of the city of Digne:Sorry to disappoint you, but Elzéard Bouffier is a fictional person. The goal was to make trees likeable, or more specifically, make planting trees likeable. In the letter, he describes how the book was translated in a multitude of languages, distributed freely, and therefore was a success. He adds that, although &quot;it does not bring me a cent&quot;, it is one of the texts of which he is most proud.

==Adaptations==

*It was adapted as an animated short by Frédéric Back and released in 1987. It earned a number of awards including an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.
*In 2006, it was adapted for the stage and puppets by Richard Medrington of &quot;Puppet State Theatre Company&quot; in Edinburgh, Scotland.
*In 2020, it was the inspiration for composer Noah Max&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet No. 1: The Man Who Planted Trees&quot;, which features a narrator reading an abridged version of Giono&#x27;s story.

==Spoken-word recordings==
In 1985 the Paul Winter Consort recorded an album with Robert J. Lurtsema as the narrator. It was made into a book-on-tape in 1990 by Earth Music Productions. In 1992, the American radio show &quot;Hearts of Space&quot; did a musically accompanied reading (episode 290, first aired on 15 May) with narration by Robert J. Lurtsema. It has also been recorded for BBC Radio 4 with Bill Paterson narrating.

Gallimard Jeunesse produced a French version in 2010 of &#x27;L&#x27;homme qui plantait des arbres&#x27;, read by Jacques Bonnaffé.

==Related works==
The original book has inspired a 2012 book on the same theme:
&quot;The Man Who Planted Trees: Lost Groves, Champion Trees, and an Urgent Plan to Save the Planet&quot; by Jim Robbins. Robbins work cites Giono&#x27;s work and goes on to consider the modern-day work of David Milarch, a Michigan nurseryman.

Environmentalist and silvologist Gabriel Hemery wrote a sequel in 2016 titled: &quot;The Man Who Harvested Trees and Gifted Life&quot;. The short story follows a girl&#x27;s life-long relationship with a forest and its trees.

<doc id="1143643" wikidata="Q1340979" url="?curid=1143643" title="Weasels Ripped My Flesh">
<text>Weasels Ripped My Flesh is the eighth album by the American rock group the Mothers of Invention, and the tenth overall by Frank Zappa, released in 1970. Following the Mothers&#x27; late 1969 split, Zappa assembled two albums - &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; and &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; - from unreleased studio and live recordings by the band, as well as some outtakes/leftovers from his 1969 solo album &quot;Hot Rats&quot;. While &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; focuses mostly on studio recordings and tightly arranged compositions, &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; focuses mostly on live recordings and loose/improvisational pieces. 

== Album information ==
Whereas all but one of the pieces on &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; have a more planned feel captured by quality studio equipment, five tracks from &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; capture the Mothers on stage, where they employ frenetic and chaotic improvisation characteristic of avant-garde jazz and free jazz. This is particularly evident on &quot;The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue&quot;, a tribute to the multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy who died in 1964 and is cited as a musical influence in the liner notes to the band&#x27;s &quot;Freak Out!&quot; album. The song opens with a complex melody over a rhythm, breaking into howls and laughter at the three-minute mark, then the theme is repeated and elaborated; after a brief rave-up section, the number concludes in stop-start fashion. This song is a feature of the annual Dolphy Day celebration at Le Moyne College, New York.

Zappa&#x27;s classical influences are reflected in characteristically satirical fashion on &quot;Prelude to the Afternoon of a Sexually Aroused Gas Mask&quot;, a play on Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun). &quot;Oh No&quot; is a vocal version of a theme that originally appeared on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; album, as well as a pointed barb aimed at the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;. &quot;The Orange County Lumber Truck&quot; incorporates the &quot;Riddler&#x27;s Theme&quot; from the &quot;Batman&quot; TV show. The album&#x27;s closer and title track consists of every player on stage producing as much noise and feedback as they can for about one and a half minutes. An audience member is heard yelling for more at its conclusion. The All-Music Guide concludes that the track is &quot;perfectly logical in the album&#x27;s context.&quot;

In contrast to the experimental jazz material, the album also contains a straightforward interpretation of Little Richard&#x27;s R&amp;B single &quot;Directly From My Heart to You&quot;, featuring violin and lead vocal from Don &quot;Sugarcane&quot; Harris. This song is actually an outtake from the sessions for the &quot;Hot Rats&quot; album.

The album also documents the brief tenure of Lowell George (guitar and vocals), who went on to found the band Little Feat with Mothers bassist Roy Estrada. On &quot;Didja Get Any Onya?&quot;, George affects a German accent to relate a story of being a small boy in Germany and seeing &quot;a lot of people stand around on the corners asking questions, &#x27;Why are you standing on the corner, acting the way you act, looking the way you look, why do you look that way?&#x27;&quot;

The Rykodisc CD reissue of the album features different versions of &quot;Didja Get Any Onya?&quot; and &quot;Prelude to the Afternoon of a Sexually Aroused Gas Mask&quot;, which featured music edited out of the LP versions. The extended version of &quot;Didja Get Any Onya?&quot; features a live performance of the composition &quot;Charles Ives&quot;, a studio recording of which had previously been released as the backing track for &quot;The Blimp&quot; on the Captain Beefheart album &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;, produced by Frank Zappa. The 2012 Universal Music reissue reverts to the original LP versions.

== Album cover ==

Frank Zappa recruited artist Neon Park to create a subversive image based on a cover story from the September 1956 issue of &quot;Man&#x27;s Life&quot;, a men&#x27;s adventure magazine. The magazine&#x27;s cover story depicts a shirtless man being attacked by numerous weasels, above the caption &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;. After showing Neon a copy of the magazine, Zappa inquired, &quot;This is it. What can you do that&#x27;s worse than this?&quot; Neon&#x27;s answer was to craft a parody of an advertisement for Schick brand electric razor based on the &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; theme. The record company released the album despite its reservations about the album cover.

German releases of the album featured a cover showing a metal baby caught in a rat trap. This cover was not approved by Zappa.

In 1975, &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; and &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; were reissued together as &quot;2 Originals of the Mothers of Invention&quot;, with the original covers used as the left and right sides of the inner spread, and the outer gatefold cover depicting a revolver shooting toothpaste onto a toothbrush.

== Reception ==
Contemporary reviews of the record called it &quot;far-out&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot;, August 29, 1970) and a &quot;random collection of editing room snippets recorded at the Mothers&#x27; concerts&quot; (&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, October 1, 1970). Now placed in its historical context, modern reviewers tend to appreciate it more favorably. A typical example of such appreciation is Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide (from 1981), which grades the album a B+. In a retrospective review, AllMusic gave it 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it a &quot;fascinating collection&quot;, and stating that &quot;Zappa&#x27;s anything-goes approach and the distance between his extremes are what make &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot; ultimately invigorating&quot; In his book &quot;Viva Zappa!&quot;, Dominique Chevalier wrote that the album is &quot;one of Zappa&#x27;s most aggressively bizarre works, full of cross-references to free jazz and modern classical musicians such as Luciano Berio&quot;. He also said that the best piece was undoubtedly &quot;Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue&quot;, calling it &quot;the cleverest tribute that could have been paid to him&quot;.

<doc id="1143649" wikidata="Q1932238" url="?curid=1143649" title="Robert Hanbury Brown">
<text>Robert Hanbury Brown, AC FRS (31 August 1916 – 16 January 2002) was a British astronomer and physicist born in Aruvankadu, India. He made notable contributions to the development of radar and later conducted pioneering work in the field of radio astronomy.

With Richard Q. Twiss he developed the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect leading to the creation of intensity interferometers. Hanbury Brown was one of the main designers of the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer and received a number of honours and awards for his work.

==Early years==
Hanbury Brown was born in Aruvankadu, the Nilgiris, British India in 1916, the son of an army officer. At age 8 he was sent to England to attend Cottesmore preparatory school in Hove, where he was educated in primarily non-scientific subjects. In 1930, at age 14, Hanbury Brown went on to attend Tonbridge School in Kent for only two years before changing to Brighton Technical College. Though originally planning to become a classics scholar, the change to a technical college came due to influences from those around him. His grandfather, Sir Robert Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., a notable irrigation engineer, was also one of the early pioneers of radio, and following Hanbury Brown&#x27;s parents&#x27; divorce, his legal guardian was a consulting radio engineer. At Brighton Technical College, Hanbury Brown studied for an external Bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from the University of London, which he received at the age of 19. At this time he also published his first paper, &#x27;Lamp polar curves on the cathode-ray oscillograph&#x27;.

==Career==
Though initially planning to study for a Ph.D. at Imperial College, London, Hanbury Brown drew the attention of Henry Tizard. Tizard recruited Hanbury Brown to work for what would become the Telecommunications Research Establishment on Chain Home in 1936, where he worked until 1942; after this he spent 3 years in Washington, D.C. to work with the Combined Research Group at the Naval Research Laboratory developing the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar which he and John William Sutton Pringle originally invented. By 1947 a consultancy that had been set up by Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the father of radar, offered more interesting prospects for the conversion of wartime developments into peacetime technologies. Hanbury Brown was recruited and worked as a consulting engineer until Watson-Watt moved the firm to Canada. After considering his career possibilities, Hanbury Brown joined Bernard Lovell&#x27;s radio astronomy group at the University of Manchester in 1949 to work on his PhD.

At the University of Manchester, Hanbury Brown worked with Cyril Hazard to modify the 218-ft radio telescope built for the study of cosmic rays into a fully functioning radio telescope. Using it they showed, among other things, that radio waves were being emitted from the Andromeda Galaxy; proving that such emissions were not just from our own galaxy. After completion of the Lovell Telescope Hanbury was among those who used it to discover quasars.

Hanbury Brown is primarily known for his work on interferometry, in particular the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect which led to intensity interferometers. Despite opposition from some in the scientific community who argued that his predictions violated the laws of physics, Hanbury Brown and Twiss showed that their theory was correct through a number of observations.

In 1962 Hanbury Brown moved to Australia to work at the University of Sydney. There he built his next interferometer – the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer – in a sheep paddock outside Narrabri in New South Wales, consisting of two 23 ft telescopes. Using it, Hanbury Brown succeeded in measuring the diameters of 32 stars, thus producing the first empirical temperature scale for hot stars. Despite only aiming to stay in Australia for two years, he stayed for a total of 27; going on to receive the Companion of the Order of Australia honour in 1986 for his work.

==Personal life==
Hanbury Brown married Heather Hilda Chesterman in 1952 with whom he had one daughter and two sons (twins). He was rumoured to have prompted the term boffin.

Hanbury Brown died in Andover, Hampshire on 16 January 2002.

==Honours and awards==
He won the Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize in 1959. In March 1960 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and in 1971 was awarded their Hughes Medal for &quot; his efforts in developing the optical stellar intensity interferometer and for his observations of Spica&quot;. In 1968, he received the Eddington Medal jointly with Twiss (see Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect). He also won the Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal of the Australian Academy of Science in 1972. In 1982 he was named President of the International Astronomical Union, a title he retained until the end of his term in 1985. In 1986 he was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia. He was awarded the Albert A. Michelson Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1982, jointly with Richard Q. Twiss and the Matthew Flinders Medal and Lecture the same year.

==Publications==
He wrote an autobiographical account of the development of airborne and ground-based radar, and his subsequent work on radio astronomy. Since he was rumoured to have been the original boffin who inspired the term, he called these recollections &quot;Boffin: A Personal Story of the Early Days of Radar, Radio Astronomy and Quantum Optics&quot;

<text>Goryeong Gaya was one of the lesser chiefdoms of the Gaya confederacy during the Three Kingdoms of Korea. It was centered in present-day Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. Legend indicates that it was founded by a King Taejo, to whom a tomb on Obong Mountain in Hamchang-eup, Sangju, is attributed. 

An alliance of marriage was established between Silla and Goryeong Gaya in 522. For this reason, Goryeong Gaya did not participate in the Baekje-Daegaya offensive against Silla in 538. However, it does not appear that this alliance was of any lasting benefit to the kingdom. According to both the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; and the Japanese chronicle &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Goryeong Gaya fell to Silla in 562. This was the same year that Daegaya was overrun in the south.

The members of today&#x27;s Hamchang Kim lineage trace their origins to the kings of Goryeong Gaya.

<text>Ruby Nell Bridges Hall (born September 8, 1954) is an American civil rights activist. She was the first African American child to attend formerly whites-only William Frantz Elementary School in Louisiana during the New Orleans school desegregation crisis on November 14, 1960. She is the subject of a 1964 painting, &quot;The Problem We All Live With&quot;, by Norman Rockwell.

==Early life==
Bridges was the eldest of five children born to Abon and Lucille Bridges. As a child, she spent much time taking care of her younger siblings, though she also enjoyed playing jump rope and softball and climbing trees. When she was four years old, the family relocated from Tylertown, Mississippi, where Bridges was born, to New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1960, when she was six years old, her parents responded to a request from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and volunteered her to participate in the integration of the New Orleans school system, even though her father was hesitant.

==Background==
Bridges was born during the middle of the Civil Rights Movement. &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; was decided three months and twenty-two days before Bridges&#x27;s birth. The court ruling declared that the establishment of separate public schools for white children, which black children were barred from attending, was unconstitutional; accordingly, black students were permitted to attend such schools. Though the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision was finalized in 1954, southern states were extremely resistant to the decision that they must integrate within six years. Many white people did not want schools to be integrated and, though it was a federal ruling, state governments were not doing their part in enforcing the new laws. In 1957, federal troops were ordered to Little Rock, Arkansas, to escort the Little Rock Nine students in combating violence that occurred following the decision. Under significant pressure from the federal government, the Orleans Parish School Board administered an entrance exam to students at Bridges&#x27;s school with the intention of keeping black children out of white schools.

==Integration==
Bridges attended a segregated kindergarten in 1959. In early 1960, Bridges was one of six black children in New Orleans to pass the test that determined whether they could go to the all-white William Frantz Elementary School. Two of the six decided to stay at their old school, Bridges went to Frantz by herself, and three children (Gail Etienne, Leona Tate and Tessie Prevost) were transferred to the all-white McDonogh No. 19 Elementary School. All four 6-year-old girls were escorted to school by federal marshals during the first day they attended the two schools. In the following days of that year, federal marshals continued to escort them.

Bridges&#x27;s father was initially reluctant, but her mother felt strongly that the move was needed not only to give her own daughter a better education, but to &quot;take this step forward ... for all African-American children&quot;. Her mother finally convinced her father to let her go to the school.

Judge J. Skelly Wright&#x27;s court order for the first day of integrated schools in New Orleans on Monday, November 14, 1960, was commemorated by Norman Rockwell in the painting, &quot;The Problem We All Live With&quot; (published in &quot;Look&quot; magazine on January 14, 1964). As Bridges describes it, &quot;Driving up I could see the crowd, but living in New Orleans, I actually thought it was Mardi Gras. There was a large crowd of people outside of the school. They were throwing things and shouting, and that sort of goes on in New Orleans at Mardi Gras.&quot; Former United States Deputy Marshal Charles Burks later recalled, &quot;She showed a lot of courage. She never cried. She didn&#x27;t whimper. She just marched along like a little soldier, and we&#x27;re all very very proud of her.&quot;

As soon as Bridges entered the school, white parents pulled their own children out; all the teachers except for one refused to teach while a black child was enrolled. Only one person agreed to teach Bridges, and that was Barbara Henry, from Boston, Massachusetts, and for over a year Henry taught her alone, &quot;as if she were teaching a whole class.&quot;

That first day, Bridges and her mother spent the entire day in the principal&#x27;s office; the chaos of the school prevented their moving to the classroom until the second day. On the second day, however, a white student broke the boycott and entered the school when a 34-year-old Methodist minister, Lloyd Anderson Foreman, walked his five-year-old daughter Pam through the angry mob, saying, &quot;I simply want the privilege of taking my child to school&quot;. A few days later, other white parents began bringing their children, and the protests began to subside.

Yet Bridges remained the only child in her class, as she would until the following year. Every morning, as Bridges walked to school, one woman would threaten to poison her, while another held up a black baby doll in a coffin. This led the U.S. Marshals dispatched to oversee her safety to only allow Bridges to eat the food that she brought from home, and she was not allowed to participate in recess.

Child psychiatrist Robert Coles volunteered to provide counseling to Bridges during her first year at Frantz. He met with her weekly in the Bridges home, and in 1995 wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Story of Ruby Bridges&quot;, to acquaint other children with Bridges&#x27;s story. Coles donated the royalties from the sale of that book to the Ruby Bridges Foundation, to provide money for school supplies or other educational needs for impoverished New Orleans school children.

The Bridges family suffered for their decision to send her to William Frantz Elementary: her father lost his job as a gas station attendant; the grocery store the family shopped at would no longer let them shop there; her grandparents, who were sharecroppers in Mississippi, were turned off their land; and Abon and Lucille Bridges separated.

Bridges has noted that many others in the community, both black and white, showed support in a variety of ways. Some white families continued to send their children to Frantz despite the protests, a neighbor provided her father with a new job, and local people babysat, watched the house as protectors, and walked behind the federal marshals&#x27; car on the trips to school. It was not until Bridges was an adult that she learned that the immaculate clothing she wore to school in those first weeks at Frantz was sent to her family by a relative of Coles. Bridges says her family could never have afforded the dresses, socks, and shoes that are documented in photographs of her escort by U.S. Marshals to and from the school.

==Adult life==
As of 2004, Bridges, now Ruby Bridges Hall, still lived in New Orleans with her husband, Malcolm Hall, and their four sons. After graduating from a desegregated high school, she worked as a travel agent for 15 years and later became a full-time parent. She is now chair of the Ruby Bridges Foundation, which she formed in 1999 to promote &quot;the values of tolerance, respect, and appreciation of all differences&quot;. Describing the mission of the group, she says, &quot;racism is a grown-up disease and we must stop using our children to spread it.&quot;

Bridges is the subject of the Lori McKenna song &quot;Ruby&#x27;s Shoes&quot;. Her childhood struggle at William Frantz Elementary School was portrayed in the 1998 made-for-TV movie &quot;Ruby Bridges&quot;. The young Bridges was portrayed by actress Chaz Monet, and the movie also featured Lela Rochon as Bridges&#x27;s mother, Lucille &quot;Lucy&quot; Bridges; Michael Beach as Bridges&#x27;s father, Abon Bridges; Penelope Ann Miller as Bridges&#x27;s teacher, Mrs. Henry; and Kevin Pollak as Dr. Robert Coles.

Like hundreds of thousands of others in the greater New Orleans area, Bridges lost her home (in Eastern New Orleans) to catastrophic flooding from the failure of the levee system during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Hurricane Katrina also greatly damaged William Frantz Elementary School, and Bridges played a significant role in fighting for the school to remain open.

In November 2007, the Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis unveiled a new permanent exhibit documenting her life, along with the lives of Anne Frank and Ryan White. The exhibit, called &quot;The Power of Children: Making a Difference&quot;, cost $6 million to install and includes an authentic re-creation of Bridges&#x27;s first grade classroom.

In 2010, Bridges had a 50th year reunion at William Frantz Elementary with Pam Foreman Testroet, who had been, at the age of five, the first white child to break the boycott that ensued from Bridges&#x27;s attendance at that school.

On July 15, 2011, Bridges met with President Barack Obama at the White House, and while viewing the Norman Rockwell painting of her on display he told her, &quot;I think it&#x27;s fair to say that if it hadn&#x27;t been for you guys, I might not be here and we wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this together&quot;. The Rockwell painting was displayed in the West Wing of the White House, just outside the Oval Office, from June through October 2011.

==Awards and honors==
In September 1995, Bridges and Robert Coles were awarded honorary degrees from Connecticut College and appeared together in public for the first time to accept the awards.

Bridges&#x27;s &quot;Through My Eyes&quot; won the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in 2000.

On August 10, 2000, the 40 year anniversary of her walk into William Frantz Elementary School, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder made Ruby Bridges an Honorary Deputy U.S. Marshal.

On January 8, 2001, Bridges was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton.

In November 2006, Bridges was honored as a &quot;Hero Against Racism&quot; at the 12th annual Anti-Defamation League &quot;Concert Against Hate&quot; with the National Symphony Orchestra, held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.

On May 19, 2012, Bridges received an honorary degree from Tulane University at the annual graduation ceremony at the Superdome.

On February 4, 2016, Bridges was the recipient of the John Steinbeck Award at San Jose State University. The award is given to those who capture &quot;Steinbeck’s empathy, commitment to democratic values, and belief in the dignity of people who by circumstance are pushed to the fringes.

On November 9, 2023, Bridges was awarded the Robert Coles &quot;Call of Service&quot; Award by the Phillips Brooks House Association at Harvard University, and gave the corresponding lecture at Memorial Church.

On March 5, 2024, Bridges was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony honored Bridges alongside renowned tennis player Serena Williams. This recognition highlights Bridges&#x27;s significant contributions to civil rights and education in the United States.

Two elementary schools are named after Bridges: one in Alameda, California, and another in Woodinville, Washington. A statue of Bridges stands in the courtyard of William Frantz Elementary School. When asked what she hopes children will feel when seeing the statue, she responded:

<doc id="1143662" wikidata="Q961326" url="?curid=1143662" title="Oliguria">
<text>Oliguria or hypouresis is the low output of urine specifically more than 80 ml/day but less than 400ml/day. The decreased output of urine may be a sign of dehydration, kidney failure, hypovolemic shock, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, urinary obstruction/urinary retention, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pre-eclampsia, and urinary tract infections, among other conditions.

Beyond oliguria is anuria, which represents an absence of urine, clinically classified as below 80 or 100 ml/day.

The term oliguria is derived from &quot;oligo&quot;-meaning &quot;small, little,&quot; + -&quot;uria&quot;, from the Greek word &quot;ouron,&quot; meaning &quot;&quot;&quot;urine&quot;.

==Definition==
Oliguria is defined as a urine output that is less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants, less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children, and less than 400 mL or 500 mL per 24h in adults - this equals 17 or 21 mL/hour. For example, in an adult weighing 70 kg it equals 0.24 or 0.3 mL/kg/h. Alternatively, however, the value of 0.5 mL/kg/h is commonly used to define oliguria in adults as well.

==Diagnostic approach==
Perform ultrasound examination of the kidney to rule out obstructive processes.

The mechanisms causing oliguria can be categorized globally in three different categories:
* Prerenal: in response to hypoperfusion of the kidney (e.g. as a result of dehydration by poor oral intake, cardiogenic shock, diarrhea, G6PD deficiency, massive bleeding or sepsis)
* Renal: due to kidney damage (severe hypoperfusion, rhabdomyolysis, medication)
* Postrenal: as a consequence of obstruction of the urine flow (e.g. enlarged prostate, tumour compression urinary outflow, expanding hematoma or fluid collection)

===Postoperative oliguria===
Patients usually have a decrease in urine output after a major operation that may be a normal physiological response to:
* fluid/ blood loss – decreased glomerular filtration rate secondary to hypovolemia and/or hypotension
* response of adrenal cortex to stress-increase in aldosterone (Na and water retention) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release

==Babies==
Oliguria, when defined as less than 1 mL/kg/h, in infants is not attributed to kidney failure.

==See also==
* Polyuria (excessive urine production)
* Anuria (absolute lack of urine output)
* Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS)

<text>Lake Grassmere / Kapara Te Hau is a New Zealand waituna-type lagoon in the northeastern South Island, close to Cook Strait. The lake is used for the production of salt.

== Geography ==
Lake Grassmere, south of Blenheim and south of the mouth of the Awatere River, is a shallow lagoon protected from the open sea by a single barrier beach covered by sand dunes. It is on the north-easterly extension of the Ward depression.

Covering an area of , it has no natural inflow and is prone to strong warm winds. Close to the sea, it also has very high salinity.

Because of these geographical characteristics, it is ideal for natural salt extraction. Grassmere has been divided into solar evaporation ponds. Seawater is pumped in, and moved between ponds over several months, increasing in salinity with each evaporation period. As salinity increases, crystallised salt forms and is extracted. These crystals give the lake a distinctive pink colour.

Grassmere&#x27;s area varies between ; this maximum is attained only in rare floods. The watershed is small. The climate, with a low average rainfall of and prevailing strong and dry north-westerly winds, provides Lake Grassmere with the suitable conditions required for natural economic salt production.

===Climate===

== Early history ==
The Māori name for the lake is Kapara Te Hau (&quot;wind-blown lake&quot;). Early whalers on the coast rendered this name “Cobblers&#x27; Hole”.

According to Māori oral tradition, the lake occupies the site of early cultivations. Kupe, the navigator, is said to have poured salt water on these cultivations, thus creating the lake.

In pre-European times it was used as a ready source of food, as it attracts a wide range of waterfowl.

In 1832–33, a year after Ngāti Toa under the leadership of Te Rauparaha had defeated Ngāi Tahu at Kaiapoi and Banks Peninsula, Ngāti Toa visited the lake to take moulting ducks. A Ngāi Tahu force, having learned of this impending visit, laid an ambush. Scouts from Te Rauparaha&#x27;s party found the locality apparently uninhabited and the canoes were driven ashore. On landing, the visitors were taken by surprise and sustained heavy casualties. Te Rauparaha was seized by Tūhawaiki, who was anxious to take him alive. The captive, however, after feigning resignation, was less tightly held. He then slipped out of his flax garment, swam to a canoe and made his escape.

== Salt industry ==
Until the 1940s Grassmere&#x27;s bed was a mud bath in winter and a dustbowl in summer, with the occasional natural deposit of salt.

The salt industry began in 1943 and now occupies one-third of the suitable lake area of . The 1960 production was 17,000 tons.
* The total consumption of industrial and domestic salt in New Zealand in 1960 was about 61,000 tons.
* Maximum expansion could produce 50,000 tons, and many economic by-products can be developed; caustic soda and gypsum are already produced in small quantities.
* In 2005 Lake Grassmere provided about half of New Zealand&#x27;s domestic salt requirements.

In addition to low rainfall, Grassmere is perfectly suited to solar salt production.
* The large area of flat land that makes up the lake bed is near the sea so it can draw in salt water, and away from large rivers.
* High evaporation from sun and wind occurs during summer, and the site has ready access to both sea and rail transport.

In the mid 1960s harvests were carried out with a new pattern of crystallising ponds which have special provision for draining off rainwater before it has had time to mix with the brine concentrate.

The harvest for 1964–65 reached 30,000 tons, a record at the time.

By 1970 the harvest had increased to almost 52,000 tonnes, but this could not match demand, which had grown with industrial development (especially from freezing works and pulp and paper mills). It became evident that Grassmere could not meet New Zealand&#x27;s salt requirements.

Bulk shipments of salt from the Caribbean and Australia were landed at Mt Maunganui, where a vacuum salt plant was built. This produced the high-purity salt needed by producers in the dairy and pharmaceutical industries. A second, smaller vacuum plant was built at Grassmere.

Some rolling stock from the railway at Grassmere salt works is preserved at the Ferrymead Two Foot Railway.

== Economics ==
A large range of salts with slightly different chemical compositions, grain sizes and shapes are produced at Lake Grassmere. All table salt produced in New Zealand is solar salt, and both iodised and non-iodised table salt are available.

Iodised salt contains added iodine (to prevent goitre) and silicon dioxide (to make the salt run). Specialty salts, including flaky salt, are also produced at Lake Grassmere.

Animal health products such as salt licks for farm animals are produced at Grassmere and Mt Maunganui.

At the end of summer Grassmere&#x27;s gleaming white salt piles are easily seen from State Highway 1. This seasonal landmark forms a vivid contrast to the burnt brown of the Marlborough hills.

==Seismic activity==
A fault running underneath Lake Grassmere triggered a magnitude 6.6 earthquake on Friday, August 16, 2013 at 2:31:05 pm. The quake was deep and was strike-slip fault similar to the 2013 Seddon earthquake on July 21, thus considered a doublet earthquake.

==Official name==
The official name of the lake become a dual name as a result of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

<text>The Churchill Mountains is a major range of mountains and associated elevations bordering the western side of the Ross Ice Shelf, between Byrd Glacier and Nimrod Glacier.
They are south of the Britannia Range and north of the Geologists Range, Miller Range and Queen Elizabeth Range.

==Exploration and naming==
Several of the range&#x27;s highest summits, including Mount Egerton, Mount Field, Mount Nares, Mount Wharton, and Mount Albert Markham were first seen and named by the British National Antarctic Expedition of 1901–1904 under Robert Falcon Scott.
The mountains were mapped in detail by the USGS from tellurometer surveys during 1960–61, and by United States Navy air photos in 1960.
They were named by the United States US-ACAN for Sir Winston Churchill.

==Location==

The Churchill mountains extend from the Byrd Glacier south to the Nimrod Glacier. The Antarctic Plateau is to their west, with various groups of nunataks, and the Ross Ice Shelf is to their east.

==Mountains and peaks==
The higher mountains and peaks include:
==Major glaciers==

*Byrd Glacier (), a major glacier in Antarctica, about long and wide. It drains an extensive area of the Antarctic plateau, and flows eastward to discharge into the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Nursery Glacier (), a coastal glacier about long that flows southeast along the west side of Darley Hills to enter Ross Ice Shelf just south of Cape Parr.
*Starshot Glacier (), a glacier long that flows from the polar plateau eastward through the Churchill Mountains, then north along the west side of Surveyors Range, entering the Ross Ice Shelf south of Cape Parr.
*Nimrod Glacier () is a major glacier about long, flowing from the polar plateau in a northerly direction through the Transantarctic Mountains into the Ross Ice Shelf. It flows north between the Geologists Range and Miller Range, then northeasterly between the Churchill Mountains and Queen Elizabeth Range, and finally spills into Shackleton Inlet and the Ross Ice Shelf between Capes Wilson and Lyttelton.

==Sub−ranges==
Sub−ranges of the Churchill Mountains include:

*Carlstrom Foothills (), a group of peaks and ridges that run north–south between Mount Albert Markham and Kelly Plateau in the Churchill Mountains. The feature is long with summits rising to .
*Carnegie Range (), long, running north–south between Errant Glacier and the Holyoake Range on the west and Algie Glacier and the Nash Range on the east. The range rises to over and is ice-covered except for peaks and ridges in the northern portion and Russell Bluff at the south end.
*Cobham Range (), trends in a northwest–southeast direction for about , standing west of Prince Philip Glacier in the southern part of the Churchill Mountains.
*Darley Hills (), a range of high, ice-covered coastal hills that overlook the Ross Ice Shelf, and trend north–south for about between Cape Douglas and Cape Parr.
*Holyoake Range , a range in the south part of the Churchill Mountains, extending in a NW-SE direction for about 25 mi between Prince Philip and Errant Glaciers.
*Nash Range (), a mainly ice-covered coastal range, 40 nautical miles (70 km) long, bordering the west side of the Ross Ice Shelf between the Dickey Glacier and Nimrod Glacier.
*Surveyors Range (), a long range extending north along the east side of Starshot Glacier from the Thompson Mountain area to the glacier&#x27;s terminus at the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Swithinbank Range , a small range extending eastward between Donnally and Ahern Glaciers to the west side of Starshot Glacier.

==Plateaus and snowfields==
*Kent Plateau (), an ice-covered plateau, long and wide, extending northward from Mount Egerton and Kiwi Pass to the vicinity of Mount Hamilton. It is in the northern extreme of the Churchill Mountains.
*Cooper Snowfield (), a snowfield with an area of about that rises to over and is nearly encircled by ridges connecting Mount Field, Mount Durnford, and Mount Liard.
*Chapman Snowfield (), a large snowfield lying west of the central ridge in the Churchill Mountains, bounded to the north by Elder Peak and the massif surmounted by Mount Wharton, to the south by Soza Icefalls, Black Icefalls and the head of Starshot Glacier, and to the west by the Wallabies Nunataks and the All-Blacks Nunataks.

<text>The , or , is a Japanese group of four men who perform dangerous and crude stunts.

== History ==
The group was formed in Tokyo in 1990. The Tokyo Shock Boys have a huge cult following in Japan and have appeared in many other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany and Scotland.

In 2006, they made appearances in &quot;Japanorama&quot;, &quot;Adam &amp; Joe go Tokyo&quot; and the &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; movie. However, their shows are viewed as having more &#x27;magic&#x27; stunts rather than painful ones. This was proven in &quot;Dirty Sanchez: The Movie&quot; as the Tokyo Shock Boys refused to do a show with &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot; because they viewed their stunts to be too extreme.

<text>Tapuae-o-Uenuku, formerly Mount Tapuaenuku, is the highest peak in the northeast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The name translates from Māori as &quot;footprint of the rainbow&quot;, though is usually regarded as being named after Chief Tapuaenuku.

At it is the highest mountain in New Zealand outside the main ranges of the Southern Alps, and over 80 metres taller than Mount Ruapehu, the tallest peak in the North Island.

It dominates the Inland Kaikōura Range, rising high above the valleys of the Waiau Toa / Clarence and Awatere Rivers. It can be seen from as far away as the Kāpiti Coast in the North Island, nearly 165 kilometres away, and is a prominent point on the horizon for travellers on the interisland ferries that ply Cook Strait.

The first European to sight the mountain was James Cook, who called it &quot;Mount Odin&quot;, but later nicknamed it &quot;The Watcher&quot; since his ship seemed to be visible from it at so many points along the coast. The first Europeans to attempt to climb the mountain were Edward John Eyre, Lieutenant-Governor of New Munster, and William John Warburton Hamilton, in 1849. They came within a short distance of the summit but were forced to turn back.

The mountain is locally known as &quot;Tappy&quot;, it was the springboard for legendary mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary&#x27;s climbing career that took him to be the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest.

&quot;I&#x27;d climbed a decent mountain at last,&quot; Sir Ed said of his weekend solo climb in 1944, while training with the Royal New Zealand Air Force in Marlborough during WW2.

<doc id="1143734" wikidata="Q2069797" url="?curid=1143734" title="Peptidomimetic">
<text>A peptidomimetic is a small protein-like chain designed to mimic a peptide. They typically arise either from modification of an existing peptide, or by designing similar systems that mimic peptides, such as peptoids and β-peptides. Irrespective of the approach, the altered chemical structure is designed to advantageously adjust the molecular properties such as stability or biological activity. This can have a role in the development of drug-like compounds from existing peptides. Peptidomimetics can be prepared by cyclization of linear peptides or coupling of stable unnatural amino acids. These modifications involve changes to the peptide that will not occur naturally (such as altered backbones and the incorporation of nonnatural amino acids). Unnatural amino acids can be generated from their native analogs via modifications such as amine alkylation, side chain substitution, structural bond extension cyclization, and isosteric replacements within the amino acid backbone. Based on their similarity with the precursor peptide, peptidomimetics can be grouped into four classes (A – D) where A features the most and D the least similarities. Classes A and B involve peptide-like scaffolds, while classes C and D include small molecules (Figure 1).

== Class A peptidomimetics ==
This group includes modified peptides that are mainly composed of proteogenic amino acids thereby closely resembling a natural peptide binding epitope. Introduced modifications usually aim to increase the stability of the peptide, its affinity for a desired binding partner, oral availability or cell permeability. The design of class A peptidomimetics often involves macrocyclization strategies as for example in stapled peptides.

== Class B peptidomimetics ==
This class of peptidomimetics encompasses peptides with a large number of non-natural amino acids, major backbone modifications or larger non-natural building fragments that resemble the conformation of a particular peptide binding motif. Examples involve D-peptide and peptidic foldamers such as beta-peptides.

== Class C peptidomimetics ==
These structural mimetics include molecules that are highly modified when compared to their parent peptide sequence. Usually, a small-molecular scaffold is appyled to project groups in analogy to the bioactive conformation of a peptide.

== Class D peptidomimetics ==
These mechanistic mimetics do not directly recapitulate the side chains or conformation of a peptide but mimic its mode-of-action. Class D peptidomimetics can be directly designed from a small peptide sequence or identified the screening of compound libraries. For example, Nirmatrelvir is an orally-active small molecule drug derived from lufotrelvir, a modified L-peptide.
==Uses and examples==
The use of peptides as drugs has some disadvantages because of their bioavailability and biostability. Rapid degradation, poor oral availability, difficult transportation through cell membranes, nonselective receptor binding, and challenging multistep preparation are the major limitations of peptides as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Therefore, small protein-like chains called peptidomimetics could be designed and used to mimic native analogs and conceivably exhibit better pharmacological properties. Many peptidomimetics are utilized as FDA-approved drugs, such as Romidepsin (Istodax), Atazanavir (Reyataz), Saquinavir (Invirase), Oktreotid (Sandostatin), Lanreotide (Somatuline), Plecanatide (Trulance), Ximelagatran (Exanta), Etelcalcetide (Parsabiv), and Bortezomib (Velcade).

Peptidomimetic approaches have been utilized to design small molecules that selectively target cancer cells, an approach known as targeted chemotherapy, by inducing programmed cell death by a process called apoptosis. The following two examples mimic proteins involved in key Protein–protein interactions that reactivate the apoptotic pathway in cancer but do so by distinct mechanisms.

In 2004, Walensky and co-workers reported a stabilized alpha helical peptide that mimics pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as BID and BAD. This molecule was designed to stabilize the native helical structure by forming a macrocycle between side chains that are &quot;not&quot; involved in binding. This process, referred to as peptide stapling, uses non-natural amino acids to facilitate macrocyclization by ring-closing olefin metathesis. In this case, a stapled BH3 helix was identified which specifically activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by antagonizing the sequestration of BH3-only proteins by anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-2, see also intrinsic and extrinsic inducers of the apoptosis). This molecule suppressed growth of human leukemia in a mouse xenograft model.

Also in 2004, Harran and co-workers reported a dimeric small molecule that mimics the proapoptotic protein Smac (see mitochondrial regulation in apoptosis). This molecule mimics the N-terminal linear motif Ala-Val-Pro-Ile. Uniquely, the dimeric structure of this peptidomimetic led to a marked increase in activity over an analogous monomer. This binding cooperativity results from the molecule&#x27;s ability to also mimic the homodimeric structure of Smac, which is functionally important for reactivating caspases. Smac mimetics of this type can sensitize an array of non-small-cell lung cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutics (e.g. Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine) both in vitro and in mouse xenograft models.

Heterocycles are often used to mimic the amide bond of peptides. Thiazoles, for example, are found in naturally occurring peptides and used by researchers to mimic the amide bond of peptides.

<text>Peng! is the debut studio album by English-French band Stereolab. It was released on 26 May 1992 by Too Pure in the United Kingdom. The album was issued in the United States on 13 June 1995 by Too Pure and American Recordings. A remastered edition of the album was released on 9 November 2018 by Too Pure and Beggars Arkive.

The album&#x27;s title (a German onomatopoeia for a loud pop or bang) and cover art are derived from a comic strip named &quot;Der tödliche Finger&quot; that appeared in a 1970 issue of &quot;Hotcha&quot;, a Swiss underground newspaper. Different panels of the same strip were adapted into cover art for other early Stereolab releases, and remain popular icons for the band.

<text>Sang Chun Lee (; January 15, 1954 – October 19, 2004), most commonly known simply as Sang Lee, was a Korean-born American professional three-cushion billiards player and world champion.

==Professional career==
Born and raised in South Korea, Lee moved to New York City, United States, in 1987, at age 33.

Dubbed the &quot;Michael Jordan of three-cushion billiards&quot; at the time of his arrival in the United States, Lee already had eight Korean national titles under his belt. Lee promptly went on to dominate three cushion billiards in the US, winning a record twelve consecutive USBA National Three-Cushion Championship, from 1990 to 2001.

Lee became the UMB World Three-cushion Championship in 1993.

in 1999 he was ranked number 11 among the Billiards Digest &quot;50 Greatest Players of the Century&quot; and ranked 5th &quot;Greatest Living Player of the Century&quot;

At the 2002 USBA National Three-Cushion Championship, his impressive run came to an end when he was defeated by Pedro Piedrabuena in the finals. Aptly, Piedrabuena received his early training in billiards from none other than Lee. The same year, Lee finished 2nd in Three-cushion event of the Asian Games where he was bested by Deuk-Hee Hwang, another Korean cue artist.

As a player, Lee&#x27;s ambition was &quot;making billiards beautiful in America&quot;, – restoring the recognition and competitive level of three-cushion in that part of the world – but he did not live to fulfill it, as he died in 2004 due to stomach cancer.

On May 15, 2007, Lee was inducted into the BCA Hall of Fame.

==Sang Lee International Open==
Each year after Lee&#x27;s death, a tournament featuring many of the world&#x27;s best three-cushion players, known as the Sang Lee International Open, has been hosted at Carom Café in Flushing, Queens, New York, the billiard hall Lee was a co-owner of at the time of his death. 2012 it has been renamed to &quot;Verhoeven Open&quot;.
