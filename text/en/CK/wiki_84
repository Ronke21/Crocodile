<text>This is a list of mayors of the city Halifax, Nova Scotia. The City of Halifax is a former municipality in Nova Scotia which was amalgamated with the City of Dartmouth Town of Bedford and Halifax County to form the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996.

This is a list of mayors for the City of Halifax from 1841 until amalgamation. Prior to the formation of the city&#x27;s elected government in 1841 the administration of the municipality was left in the hands of a selected group of men. The first mayor was elected to council and chosen for this position by his peers in council.

Prior 1850 the mayor was elected amongst the elected councillors. The first mayor elected directly by citizens was William Caldwell. The mayor continues to act as a councillor-at-large and has a direct vote on all council decisions.

<doc id="1144280" wikidata="Q7120501" url="?curid=1144280" title="Pennsylvania Railroad class N1s">
<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) N1s was a class of 2-10-2 &quot;Santa Fe&quot; steam locomotives built for the Pennsylvania&#x27;s Lines West. 60 engines were built between December 1918 and November 1919, and worked heavy mineral freight to and from ports on the Great Lakes until their retirement in the late 1940s. All examples were scrapped by 1950.

== Overview ==
The 2-10-2 wheel arrangement, ten driving wheels with a two-wheel leading truck and a two-wheel cast KW-pattern trailing truck under a large Belpaire firebox, suited the N1s&#x27; intended purpose well. They were drag freight engines, designed to haul heavy freight up the 0.3% grade leading out of the PRR&#x27;s &quot;Lake ports,&quot; and were rated at 6000 tons (5443 tonnes) on these relatively easy grades. The design was developed by the PRR&#x27;s Fort Wayne Shops and orders were placed with Alco (Brooks) (35 locomotives) and Baldwin (25 locomotives) for a total of 60; the first Alco locomotive was delivered in December 1918, with the remainder arriving during 1919.

The N1s was a large locomotive; the boiler was the largest then used on any non-experimental PRR locomotive, and the firebox had of grate area and a long combustion chamber. No feedwater heater was fitted, but a mechanical stoker and power reverse were installed, being necessities on such a large locomotive. Boiler pressure was initially set at , but was quickly raised to . The boiler was reportedly designed to take a pressure of , but whether it attained this pressure in service is not known.

To allow the locomotive to negotiate tight 22-degree curves, the first and fifth driving axles were fitted with lateral motion devices and the center axle was blind.

== Comparison ==
In many respects, the N1s was similar to the I1s 2-10-0 &quot;Decapod&quot;. Driver diameter was identical, and the cylinders on the I1s were a mere wider, having the same stroke of . The N1s had a longer boiler at long, but the I1s used a higher working pressure of . The I1s&#x27; tractive effort was higher, at just over , but the N1s had a superior factor of adhesion—4.13 to the I1s&#x27; 3.28, suggesting the N1s had less of a tendency to slip than the Decapod. The N1s, as a low speed drag hauler, was limited to , while the I1s was capable of or greater.

== Disposition ==
The N1s were the first class of large power withdrawn after diesel locomotives appeared, as diesels proved superior at the low-speed &quot;lugging&quot; the N1s was designed for. All were scrapped by 1950.

<text>The Chitty, also known as the Chetty or Chetti Melaka, are an ethnic group whose members are of primarily Tamil descent, found mainly and initially in Melaka, Malaysia, where they settled around the 16th century, and in Singapore where they migrated to in the 18th and 19th centuries from Melaka. Also known colloquially as &quot;Indian Peranakans&quot;, the culture of the Chitty has drawn significant influence from the Nusantara region and to a small extent the Chinese, whilst also retaining their Hindu faith and heritage. In the 21st century, their population stands at 2,000. The Chitty/Chetti community are different from Chettiar, bankers brought from Tamil Nadu to British Malaya. They are practising Hindus.

Like the Peranakans, the Chitty speak a Malay patois proper to their community, which is mixed with many Tamil loan words. Most of the Chitty are unable to communicate in Tamil.

==History==
Historical records stated that the Tamil traders from Panai in Tamil Nadu settled down in Melaka during the sovereignty of the Sultanate of Malacca. Like the Peranakans, they later settled down and freely intermingled with the local Malays and Chinese of Malay and Tamil ancestry settlers. However, with the fall of the Malacca Sultanate after 1511, the Chitty eventually lost touch with their native land.

Under the administration of the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers, the Chitty eventually began simplifying their culture and customs by adopting local customs. This can be evidenced in the architecture of the Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple, which was built by Thaivanayagam Pillay, the leader of the Chitty people, in 1781 after the Dutch colonial government gave him a plot of land. At that period, a Chitty neighbourhood was probably set up around that temple, in the street known as Goldsmith Street.

During the Second World War, the threat of Japanese soldiers rape against Chitty girls led Chitty families to let Eurasians, Chinese and full blooded Indians to marry Chitty girls and stop practicing endogamy.

The traditional Chitty settlement is located at Kampung Tujuh along Jalan Gajah Berang, which is also inhabited by a small number of Chinese of Tamilian ancestry and Malays as well. Many of the Chitty have since found jobs in Singapore and other parts of Malaysia.

The ethnic identity of the Chitty is nearly lost. As many of them are assimilating into the mainstream Indian, Chinese and Malay ethnic communities culturally, this small but distinct group of people that has survived for centuries is now on the brink of extinction.

Exhibition of Peranakan Chitty history, antiques and culture can be seen at the Chitty Museum in Chitty Village, Melaka, Malaysia. Recently in 2013, there were controversies of development at the expense of demolishing part of Kampung Chitty, a historical and cultural village. A proposal to construct a condominium, a hotel and a road cutting through the village are seen as a threat affecting the residents and a temple built in 1827.

==Religion==

The Chitty are a tightly knit community of Saivite Hindus, worshipping in their three temples. Gods such as Ganesha and Shiva are worshipped in full gaiety. Hints of Taoist and Islamic influences are also evident in their religious rituals. As staunch believers of the Hindu faith, the 
Melakan Chitty community still upholds their religious ceremonies. They observe Deepavali, Ponggal, the Hindu New Year, Navratri and other traditional Hindu festivals that are celebrated by Hindu groups in Malaysia. However, the Chitty do not participate in Thaipusam at a grand level like most Hindu groups. During the month of May they have a similar festival to Thaipusam in their local temple called Mengamay. One celebration that is unique to the Chitty community is the Parchu festival. It is celebrated twice a year with Parchu Ponggal (Bhogi) observed the day before Ponggal in January and Parchu Buah-buahan during the fruit season between June and July.

==Culture==
Culturally, the Chitty have largely assimilated into the Malay culture with some Chinese, Dutch and Portuguese influences, although certain elements of Indian culture do remain. This is especially true in the case of marriages, where offerings of fruits and burning of incense are used. In the case of food, Malay spices, ingredients and the way of cooking have largely supplanted the Indian style. 

Chinese cultural influence on the Chetty is also evident, especially in the case of ancestral worship. Religious objects used for conducting rituals were also used by the Chinese. The Chitty are also influenced by the Chinese to some extent in their ceramics works of art.

Simplification of Tamil architecture among the Chitty is also present. Distinct from the modern Tamil Nadu, known for its complex Tamizh Temple Architecture in the early pandya, medieval chozha/ chera&amp; late Nayaka dynasties/Vijayanagara], that displays beautifully carved out sculptures of the Hindu gods in many rows, the Chitty temple tend to only have one row of these, or a picture of one single god in each of the three rows, as evidenced in the Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple, built by Thaivanayagam Chitty in 1781. The Chitty temples also demonstrate the adoption of some Dutch colonial architectural influences.

==Dress and lifestyle==
Most of the Chitty have adopted the Malay costume. In the case of men, a comfortable sarong and Malay shirt may be worn, although a songkok may also be worn. Women, on the other hand, wear a similar costume that are similar to the Peranakan Nonya.

Alongside their Chinese of Tamilian ancestry and Malay neighbours, the Chitty live in Kampong houses. Pictures of Hindu gods and Indian names can be seen just outside their houses, as their descendants tend to adopt Indian, rather than Malay surnames.

A typical Chitty home is distinctly marked by mango leaves arranged in a row, dangling from above the front door. Chitty temples are also adorned this way.

This is the old tradition still followed in Tamil Nadu from ancient period during functions.

<doc id="1144298" wikidata="Q333868" url="?curid=1144298" title="Azem Vllasi">
<text>Azem Vllasi (born 23 December 1948) is a Kosovo Albanian politician and lawyer. He served as the president of the presidency of the Provincial Committee of the League of Communists of Kosovo (LKK) from 29 April 1986 to 27 April 1988. A critic of Slobodan Milošević, Vllasi was removed from power amidst the anti-bureaucratic revolution. He later became a lawyer and political consultant.

== Early years ==
Vllasi was born in Robovac, Kosovska Kamenica, Yugoslavia, in today&#x27;s Kosovo.
In his youth and student years, Vllasi chaired a number of youth organizations: the student league of Kosovo and of Yugoslavia, and from 1974, the League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia. As socialist youth chairman, he became popular and gained the support of President Tito, which helped him to become the first re-elected youth leader. After graduation, he became a lawyer before joining big politics. In 1980, he publicly challenged the autocratic ruler of Albania, Enver Hoxha, claiming that ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia were better off than people in Albania and describing his rule as brutal and dictatorial. Azem Vllasi was a Chevening Scholarship holder in early 1970s and studied at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. 

== Leader of Kosovo and dismissal ==
Later on, Vllasi became a member of the central committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and became the leader of the League of Communists of Kosovo in 1986. Under Vllasi, the Albanian-led Party took a more assertive position towards the Serbian government, and could be expected to put up strong opposition to any moves to reassert Serbian authority over Kosovo. The autonomous province of Kosovo at the time had an equal vote in the federal presidency of Yugoslavia with the Yugoslav republics, and its own executive body, legislature, and judiciary.

In November 1988, Kaqusha Jashari, who had succeeded Vllasi as LKK president in April, and Vlassi himself were toppled in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution because of their unwillingness to accept the constitutional amendments curbing Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy, and replaced by appointees of Slobodan Milošević, the leader of the League of Communists of Serbia at the time. In response to this, the local population started a series of public demonstrations and a general strike, particularly the 1989 Kosovo miners&#x27; strike.

A partial state of emergency in Kosovo was declared on February 27, 1989, and the newly appointed leaders resigned on February 28. Soon thereafter, Kosovo&#x27;s legislature, under a threat of force authorised by the federal presidency, acquiesced and passed the amendments allowing Serbia to assert its authority over Kosovo. Vllasi was arrested by the police on the charges of &quot;counter-revolutionary activities&quot;. He was released from the Točak prison in Titova Mitrovica in April 1990.

== Today ==
Vllasi survived the war years and works today as a lawyer, author, and political adviser/consultant. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Kosovo (PSDK). In December 2005, Kosovo&#x27;s prime minister Bajram Kosumi appointed Vllasi as special adviser for negotiations over the final status of Kosovo. Vllasi also served as a political advisor to Kosovo&#x27;s prime minister Agim Çeku.

Vllasi is married to Nadira Avdić-Vllasi, a Bosniak journalist. They have two children, Adem, a practicing attorney in the United States, and Selma, a medical practitioner who also lives and works in the United States.

===Assassination attempt===
On 13 March 2017 Vllasi was wounded by an assassin at the entrance of his office where he worked as a lawyer, who was later arrested together with an accomplice.
The assassin was Murat Jashari, who was sentenced to psychiatric treatment at the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry in Pristina, where he later died of cancer on 3 March 2021.

<doc id="1144302" wikidata="Q1318670" url="?curid=1144302" title="Chinatown, Singapore">
<text>Chinatown is a subzone and ethnic enclave located within the Outram district in the Central Area of Singapore. Featuring distinctly Chinese cultural elements, Chinatown has had a historically concentrated ethnic Chinese population. 

Chinatown is considerably less of an enclave than it once was. However, the precinct does retain significant historical and cultural significance. Large sections of it have been declared national heritage sites officially designated for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

==Etymology==

Singapore&#x27;s Chinatown is known as &quot;Niu che shui&quot; in Mandarin, &quot;Gû-chia-chúi&quot; in Hokkien, and &quot; Ngàuh-chē-séui&quot; in Cantonese - all of which mean &quot;bullock water-cart&quot; - and Kreta Ayer in Malay, which means &quot;water cart&quot;. This is due to the fact that Chinatown&#x27;s water supply was principally transported by animal-driven carts in the 19th century. Although these names are sometimes used for referring to Chinatown in general, they actually refer to the area of Kreta Ayer Road.

==Geography==
Chinatown consists of four distinctive sub-areas which were developed at different times.
*Telok Ayer - developed in the 1820s. 
*Kreta Ayer - developed in the 1830s
*Bukit Pasoh - developed in early 1900s
*Tanjong Pagar - developed in the 1920s
Chinatown Complex is located along Smith Street, which was known colloquially as hei yuan kai (theatre street) in Cantonese because of its famous Cantonese opera theatre Lai Chun Yuen, which opened in 1887 to cater to the Cantonese community there, drawing large crowds during the 1910s and 1920s (Nasir, 2005).

==History==

===Development ===
Under the Raffles Plan of Singapore, Chinatown originally was a division of colonial Singapore where Chinese immigrants tended to reside. Although as Singapore grew, Chinese immigrants settled in other areas of the island-city, Chinatown became overcrowded within decades of Singapore&#x27;s founding in 1819 and remained such until many residents were relocated at the initiation of Singapore&#x27;s governmental Housing Development Board in the 1960s.

In 1822, Sir Stamford Raffles wrote to Captain C. E. Davis, President of the Town Committee, and George Bonham and Alex L. Johnson, Esquires, and members, charging them with the task of &quot;suggesting and carrying into effect such arrangements on this head, as may on the whole be most conducive to the comfort and security of the different classes of inhabitants and the general interests and welfare of the place...&quot;

He went on to issue instructions, as a guide to the Committee, which included a general description of Singapore Town, the ground reserved by the government, the European town and principal mercantile establishments and the native divisions and &quot;kampungs&quot;. These included areas for Bugis, Arabs, Indians, Malays, and Chinese kampungs. Raffles was very clear in his instructions and his guidelines were to determine the urban structure of all subsequent development. The &quot;five-foot way&quot;, for example, the continuous covered passage on either side of the street, was one of the public requirements.

Raffles foresaw the fact that &quot;it may be presumed that they (the Chinese) will always form by far the largest portion of the community&quot;. For this reason, he appropriated all of the land southwest of the Singapore River for their accommodation but, at the same time, insisted that the different classes and the different provinces be concentrated in their separate quarters and that these quarters, in the event of fire, be constructed of masonry with tiled roofs.

This thus resulted in the formation of a distinct section titled Chinatown. However, only when parcels of land were leased or granted to the public in and after 1843 for the building of houses and shophouses, did Chinatown&#x27;s physical development truly begin.

===Legacy===
The legacy of cultural diversity in Chinatown is still present. There used to exist some Hokkien merchants along Havelock Road, Telok Ayer Street, China Street and Chulia Street, and Teochew merchants are mostly in Circular Road, River Valley Road, Boat Quay, and South Bridge Road near Chinatown. The ubiquitous Cantonese are scattered around South Bridge Road, Upper Cross Street, New Bridge Road, and Bukit Pasoh Road as well as others. These days, the former Hokkien and Teochew residents have largely scattered to other parts of the island, leaving the Cantonese as the dominant dialect group in Chinatown. 

The Chinese names of Pickering Street are &quot;Kian Keng Khau&quot; (mouth of the gambling houses) or &quot;Ngo Tai Tiahn Hok Kiong Khau&quot; (mouth of the five generations of the Tian Hok Temple).

There are also several prominent century-old Chinese temples like Hokkien Thian Hock Keng Temple at Telok Ayer Street, Teochew Wak Hai Cheng Bio Temple at Phillips Street, Siang Cho Keong Temple at Amoy Street, Seng Wong Beo Temple at Peck Seah Street, and Cantonese Cundhi Gong Temple at Keong Siak Roadside.

Guilds, clans, trade unions and associations were all referred to as &quot;kongsi&quot; are present within Chinatown such as to assist to the needs of each Chinese dialect group, such as Cantonese, Hokkien, etc. 

There were the letter writers of Sago Street—in Hokkien this street is called &quot;Gu Chia Chwi Hi Hng Cheng&quot; (front of Kreta Ayer Theatre), but it was mainly associated with life and death — the sandalwood idols of Club Street and the complicated and simple food of Mosque Street; all rang to the sound of the abacus. Old women could be seen early in the mornings topping and tailing bean sprouts, the skins of frogs being peeled, the newly killed snakes being skinned and the centuries-old panaceas being dispensed by women blessed with the power of healing.

Besides Chinese residents, other races such as the Indians whom migrated during the British Raj live in Chinatown. Within the Chinatown is an important temple for the Tamils, the Sri Mariamman Hindu Tamil Temple, and also mosques, Al-Abrar Mosque at Telok Ayer Street, and Jamae Mosque at Mosque Street. These places of worship catered to the pockets of non-Chinese residents in the area and shows that despite efforts to segregate the early immigrants, they had no qualms living peacefully together, and side by side.

====Street name origins====

* Mosque Street is named after Jamae Mosque, located on the South Bridge Road end of the street. The mosque was completed in 1830 by the Chulia Muslims from the Coromandel coast of South India but also used by the Malay Muslims living in the area. In the early years, Mosque Street was the site of ten stables.
* Pagoda Street takes its name from the Sri Mariamman Temple. During the 1850s and 1880s, the street was one of the centres of slave traffic. It also had its share of coolie quarters and opium smoking dens. One of the traders was Kwong Hup Yuen who, it is thought, occupied No. 37, and after whom Pagoda Street is often referred to today.
* Sago Lane and Sago Street got their name because in the 1840s there were a number of sago factories located there. Sago is taken from the pith of the rumbia palm and made into flour that is used for making cakes both sweet and savoury. Funerary businesses were formerly prominent on Sago Lane.
* Smith Street was probably named after Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, who was the Governor of the Straits Settlements between 1887 and 1893.
* Temple Street refers to the Sri Mariamman Temple, which is located at the South Bridge Road end of the street. It was formerly known as Almeida Street after Joaquim d&#x27;Almeida, son of José D&#x27;Almeida, who owned some land at the junction of Temple Street and Trengganu Street. In 1908, the Municipal Commissioners changed its name to Temple Street to avoid confusion with other streets in Singapore which were also named after D&#x27;Almeida.
* Trengganu Street, described as &quot;the Piccadilly of Chinese Singapore&quot; in the past, now forms the heart of the tourist belt in Chinatown. In Chinese, it is called &quot;gu chia chui wah koi&quot;, or &quot;the cross street of Kreta Ayer&quot;. The crossing of streets refers to Smith Street and Sago streets. The street name is derived from Terengganu, a state in present-day Peninsular Malaysia.

==Architecture==
The street architecture of Chinatown&#x27;s buildings, the shophouses especially, combine different elements of baroque architecture and Victorian architecture and do not have a single classification. Many of them were built in the style of painted ladies, and have been restored in that fashion. These styles result in a variety of different colours of which pastel is most dominant. Trengganu Street, Pagoda Street, and Temple Street are such examples of this architecture, as well as development in Upper Cross Street and the houses in Club Street. Boat Quay was once a slave market along the Singapore River, Boat Quay has the most mixed-style shophouses on the island.

In 1843, when land titles were issued, the terraces in Pagoda Street (now with additions, mostly three-story) were born. They were originally back to back, an arrangement which made night soil collection difficult, but lanes were developed in between following the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) back lane orders of 1935.

The architectural character of many of the terraces in Chinatown is much more Italianate in style than those of, for instance Emerald Hill or Petain Road. Windows often appear as mere slits with narrow timber jalousies (often with adjustable slats). Fanlights over the windows are usually quite decorative and the pilasters and balconies and even the plasterwork and colours seem to be Mediterranean in flavour. The style was probably introduced by those early Chinese immigrants (both China-born and Straits-born) who had knowledge of the Portuguese architecture of Macau, Malacca, and Goa, while the Indians would also have been familiar with the European architecture there, although it is difficult to imagine how these people would have had a particularly strong influence on building in Chinatown.

==Transportation==
The Mass Rapid Transit MRT serves the area at Chinatown MRT station on the North East and Downtown lines, in the middle of pedestrian-only Pagoda Street, and serves the vicinity, as well as several public bus routes which integrates it into Singapore&#x27;s transportation system. Nearby are the Tanjong Pagar MRT station on the East West MRT line; Outram Park MRT station, an interchange between the East West line and North East line; and Clarke Quay MRT station on the North East line, as well as a bus terminal called Kampong Bahru Bus Terminal.

==Politics==
Chinatown is divided between two Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs), Tanjong Pagar and Jalan Besar, in terms of representation in Parliament. Singapore&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, was a Member of Parliament representing Tanjong Pagar GRC before his death in March 2015. After the September 2015 general election, Indranee Rajah now represents that part of Tanjong Pagar GRC. The Chinatown area that is part of Jalan Besar GRC is represented by Josephine Teo since 2020, following the retirement of Lily Neo after serving 23 years of politics from 1997.

== Activity ==
The shophouses were home to &quot;death houses&quot; until 1961, when death houses were banned, and brothels until 1930, when the Women and Girl&#x27;s Protection Ordinance was enacted, bringing the prostitution
situation under control. To cater to those who visited brothels, or participated in extended affairs of Chinese funerals or came to frequent the opera theatre, street hawkers, food stalls and traders selling household goods occupied the streets. In order to address overcrowding and
poor living conditions in the city, all street hawkers were relocated into the newly built Kreta Ayer Complex in 1983, which is today&#x27;s Chinatown Complex.

<text>Leonard Arthur Kitz QC (April 9, 1916 – January 30, 2006) was the first Jewish mayor of Halifax, Nova Scotia (1955–1957).

== Biography ==
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Harry and Yetta (née Lesser) Kitz, he grew up with older sister Hildred Kitz (Silver) and younger brother Joe. He attended Halifax&#x27;s Protestant school system, there being no state-supported school for non-Christians, and graduated from the Halifax Academy. He attended Dalhousie University, where he studied law, graduating from Dalhousie Law School in 1938.

With the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Kitz joined the Canadian Army becoming an infantry officer in the Princess Louise Fusiliers. During the war, he served in Italy and the Netherlands. After the war he served as a lawyer in military tribunals.

While serving in England in 1945, Kitz met and married Dr. Alice Duff Findlay. The two returned to Halifax after the war where Kitz opened his law firm, located on Granville Street. His law firm was eventually joined by Robert Matheson becoming Matheson and Kitz. Kitz served as President of the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society from 1968 to 1969.

In 1948, Kitz decided to enter politics and he was elected an alderman in Halifax. He served as an alderman from 1948 to 1955. Kitz is most remembered for his part as the &#x27;driving force&#x27; behind the funding and construction of a statue of Winston Churchill which is a landmark on Halifax&#x27;s Spring Garden Road. Kitz was the first Jewish mayor in the city&#x27;s long history. 

Kitz was re-elected in 1956, but two years later he resigned the mayorship to run, unsuccessfully, as a Liberal for parliament in the federal riding of Halifax. He was one of the founders of the city&#x27;s most prestigious independent school, The Halifax Grammar School, opened in 1958.

Kitz&#x27; first wife died in 1969. He remarried in 1971 to Janet (née Brownlee) Kitz who became a noted historian of the Halifax Explosion and author of a number of books on the subject. The couple played an important leadership role in organizing public commemorations of the explosion.

<doc id="1144305" wikidata="Q57576" url="?curid=1144305" title="Kurt Daluege">
<text>Kurt Max Franz Daluege (15 September 1897 – 24 October 1946) was a German &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; and &quot;Generaloberst&quot; of the police, the highest ranking police officer, who served as chief of &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police) of Nazi Germany from 1936 to 1943, as well as the Deputy/Acting Protector of Bohemia and Moravia from 1942 to 1943. 

Daluege served in the Royal Prussian Army during the First World War on both fronts. He was severely wounded and received the Iron Cross, second class for his bravery. After the war, he became a member of Gerhard Roßbach&#x27;s &quot;Freikorps&quot;. In 1922, Daluege joined the Nazi Party and soon entered the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), eventually becoming the SA leader in Berlin. He transferred to the SS in 1930 and was later elected as a &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputy. In 1933, Hermann Göring appointed Daluege to the Prussian Interior Ministry and placed him in charge of the Prussian police forces. In that position, he played an important role in carrying out the Night of the Long Knives, in which Ernst Röhm and other leading member of the SA were murdered. By late 1934, his authority was extended to include all of Germany, and two years later Heinrich Himmler named him chief of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo) following the reorganisation of the German police force.

By the outbreak of the Second World War, Daluege&#x27;s Orpo had as many as 120,000 active-duty personnel. The organisation took part in policing, deportations and mass murder throughout German-occupied areas and had an integral role in carrying out the Holocaust. Following Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s assassination in 1942, Daluege was named Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia and directed the German reprisal actions, including the Lidice massacre. At the end of the war, Daluege was arrested and extradited to Czechoslovakia, where he was tried and convicted for crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in October 1946.

==Early life and career==
Daluege, son of a Prussian state official, was born in the small Upper Silesian town of Kreuzburg (now Kluczbork) on 15 September 1897. He entered the Prussian Army in 1916 and served with the 7th Guards Infantry Regiment, attaining the rank of &quot;Vizefeldwebel&quot;. He served on the Eastern Front. In October 1917, he attended officers training in Doberitz. During his service on the Western Front, he was severely wounded in the head and shoulder in April 1918. He was hospitalised until October and declared 25% disabled. Daluege was awarded the Iron Cross, second class (1918) and the Wound Badge in Black (1918).

==1920s==
After World War I, Daluege became leader of &quot;Selbstschutz Oberschlesien&quot; (SSOS) - Upper Silesian Self Defense  — an Upper Silesian veterans&#x27; organization engaged in combat with the Poles in that region. In 1921, he also became active in the &quot;Freikorps&quot; &quot;Rossbach&quot; while studying engineering at Technische Hochschule in Berlin, where he eventually earned a civil engineering degree. Two years later he joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and was assigned Party number 31,981. He also joined the Greater German Workers&#x27; Party in the same year. From 1924, he helped to organize the Berlin &quot;Frontbann&quot;, largely a front organization for the Nazi &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), since it and the Nazi Party were banned in Prussia at that time. On 22 March 1926, he joined the SA, becoming the SA-&quot;Gauführer&quot; of Berlin, which he would continue to lead until 21 June 1928. On 1 November 1926, he became Joseph Goebbels&#x27; deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot; in Gau Berlin-Brandenburg (later, Gau Groß-Berlin), a post he would retain until 1 November 1930.

==SS and police leader==
In July 1930, in accordance with Hitler&#x27;s wishes, Daluege resigned from the SA and joined the SS with the rank of SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; and membership number 1,119. His main responsibility was to spy on the SA and political opponents of the Nazi Party. Berlin SS headquarters was strategically placed at the corner of Lützowstrasse and Potsdamerstrasse, opposite the SA headquarters.

In August 1930, when Berlin SA leader Walter Stennes had his men attack the Berlin Party headquarters, it was Daluege&#x27;s SS men who defended it and put the attack down. Sometime afterwards in an open letter to Daluege, Adolf Hitler proclaimed &quot;SS Mann, deine Ehre heißt Treue!&quot; (&quot;SS man, your honour is loyalty&quot;). Then, the slogan &quot;Meine Ehre heißt Treue&quot; (My honour is loyalty) was duly adopted by the SS as its motto. Hitler promoted both Daluege and Heinrich Himmler to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;, with Daluege the SS leader of northern Germany while Himmler controlled the southern SS units out of Munich in addition to serving as national leader for the entire SS.

In April 1932, Daluege was elected a Nazi Party deputy to the Landtag of Prussia where he served until its dissolution in October 1933. In June 1933, he was appointed the Deputy Plenipotentiary for Prussia to the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; where he served until its abolition on 14 February 1934. On 11 July 1933, Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring appointed Daluege to the recently reconstituted Prussian State Council. In September 1933, Göring moved Daluege to the Prussian Interior Ministry, where he took over the nonpolitical police with the rank of &quot;Generalmajor der Landespolizei&quot;. On 12 November 1933, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; representing the Potsdam II (later, Berlin–East) electoral district, a seat he retained until 1945. Intrigues created by Göring, Himmler and Heydrich surrounding Ernst Röhm led to Daluege&#x27;s playing an important role in the infamous Night of the Long Knives. In that operation, Röhm and other leading members of the SA were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934, thus neutralizing the SA and shifting the balance of power within the party to the SS.

Evidence of Daluege&#x27;s ruthlessness goes beyond his intrigue against his former SA comrades, and is discernible in his remarks about anyone he considered a threat to society. He once argued that &quot;the consciously asocial enemies of the people (&quot;Volksfeinde&quot;)&quot; must be eliminated by state intervention &quot;if it hopes to prevent the outbreak of complete moral degeneration.&quot; Historian George Browder claims that Daluege &quot;bragged that the Police Institute for detective training had especially been reorganized according to NS viewpoints&quot;, and that advancement within this organization was contingent to a considerable degree on the internalization of Nazi ideology.

By November 1934, Daluege&#x27;s authority over the uniformed police was extended beyond Prussia to include all of Germany. That meant he commanded municipal police forces, the rural gendarmerie, traffic police, the coastguard, the railway police, the postal protection service, fire brigades, the air-raid services, the emergency technical service, the broadcasting police, the factory protection police, building regulations enforcement, and the commercial police.
In 1936, the entire German police force was reorganized with the administrative functions previously exercised by the now largely defunct federal states reassigned to the nominal control of the Reich Interior Ministry, but under the actual control of Himmler&#x27;s SS. Making the most of his police expertise and coinciding with his appointment, Daluege wrote and published a book entitled &quot;National-sozialistischer Kampf gegen das Verbrechertum&quot; (NS Struggle against Criminality). That same year, Himmler appointed Daluege as chief of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo), which gave him administrative, though not executive, authority over most of the uniformed police in Nazi Germany. He commanded the Orpo until 1943, rising to the rank of &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer und Generaloberst der Polizei&quot;.
Reinhard Heydrich, who took control of the SiPo (Security Police) at the same time that Daluege took control of the Orpo, thought very little of Daluege, as he was a former rival in the early struggle for power, and was contemptuously referred to by Heydrich as &#x27;Dummi-Dummi&#x27;, or &#x27;the idiot&#x27;. 

By August 1939, the strength of the Orpo under Daluege&#x27;s command and control had reached upwards of 120,000 active-duty personnel.
Further indications of the brutality coming from Daluege&#x27;s office (Chief of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;), are shown in a report dated 5 September 1939, outlining the methods to be employed during pacification operations in Poland. Regarding uniformed police battalions for planned reprisal actions around the Polish town of Czestochowa, the report gave the following instructions: &quot;[t]he leader of this battalion is ordered to take the most drastic actions and measures such as those in the upper Silesian industrial area, the hanging of Polish &quot;franc-tireurs&quot; from light poles as a visible symbol for the entire population.&quot;

During the war in 1941, he attended a mass murder of 4,435 Jews by Police Battalion 307 near Brest-Litowsk and a mass murder of Jews in Minsk. Furthermore, in October 1941 Daluege signed deportation orders for Jews from Germany, Austria and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, to Riga and Minsk. On 7 July 1942, he attended a conference led by Himmler which discussed the &quot;enlargement&quot; of Operation Reinhard, the secretive Nazi plan to mass-murder Polish Jews in the General Government district of occupied Poland, and other matters involving SS and police policies in the east.

==Massacre of Lidice==
In 1942 Daluege became the Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, following the assassination of Deputy Protector Reinhard Heydrich. There seemed to be almost no logic behind Hitler appointing Daluege beyond the fact that he was a senior SS officer and was already in Prague at the time, where he had arrived on the day of Heydrich&#x27;s assassination for medical treatment. Hitler originally wanted to appoint Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski but Himmler persuaded Hitler not to do so, arguing that Bach-Zelewski could not be spared because of the military situation on the Eastern front. Although Konstantin von Neurath was nominally Protector he had been stripped of his authority in 1941, so Daluege was Acting Protector in all but name. In June 1942, along with Karl Hermann Frank and other SS operatives, he ordered the villages of Lidice and Ležáky razed in reprisal for Heydrich&#x27;s death. All the men in both villages were murdered, while many of the women and children were deported to Nazi concentration camps.

==Personal life==
On 16 October 1926, Daluege married Käthe Schwarz (born 23 November 1901) who later became a member of the Nazi Party (member no. 118,363). In 1937, Daluege and his wife adopted a son. Afterwards, Daluege&#x27;s wife bore three biological children, two sons born in 1938 and 1940 and a daughter born in 1942.

In May 1943, Daluege became seriously ill after a massive heart attack. In August, he was relieved of all of his day-to-day responsibilities and spent the rest of the war living on a property in western Pomerania, given to him by Hitler.

==Arrest, trial, conviction and sentence==
In May 1945, Daluege was arrested by British troops in Lübeck and interned in Luxembourg and then at Nuremberg, where he was charged as &quot;a major war criminal&quot;. In September 1946 after being extradited to Czechoslovakia, he was tried for his many crimes against humanity committed in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Throughout his trial, Daluege was unrepentant, claiming he was beloved by &quot;three million policemen&quot;, only following Hitler&#x27;s orders, and had a clear conscience. He was convicted on all charges and sentenced to death on 23 October 1946. Daluege was hanged in Pankrác prison in Prague on 24 October 1946.

Kelly is the former Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, who was fired in May 2022. He is a former mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), Nova Scotia. Kelly was elected to Bedford town council in 1985, then became mayor in 1991. In 1995, in the newly amalgamated HRM, he was elected councillor for Bedford, Nova Scotia. In 2000, he was elected Mayor of the HRM. Under scrutiny for his role in the HRM concert scandal and as executor for the will of Mary Thibeault, Kelly left politics in 2012 citing &#x27;personal reasons&#x27;.

==Background==
Kelly holds a Diploma in Hospitality Management from the Nova Scotia Community College and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Saint Mary&#x27;s University. He has held administrative and managerial positions in private industry and government since 1980.

==Career==
===Councillor and Mayor of Bedford===
Kelly began his political career in the former town of Bedford as a municipal councillor elected in 1985. He was elected Mayor of Bedford in 1991.

===Mayor of Halifax Regional Municipality===
Kelly was the second mayor of HRM, defeating the incumbent, Walter Fitzgerald, in 2000. He was re-elected in 2004 and 2008. Kelly was the longest-serving mayor of Halifax Regional Municipality, being elected in 2000 then re-elected in 2004 and 2008.

During Kelly&#x27;s time as mayor, the region installed a large and long-delayed sewage treatment system known as Halifax Harbour Solutions which came into operation in 2008, broke down and was restored in 2010. Kelly was criticized for the failure of the city&#x27;s Harbour Solutions sewage treatment plant which had faced delays and breakdowns.

During this time the municipality attracted several large profile national events such as the 2011 Canada Winter Games and some international events such as Tall Ships visits. A popular outcome of the Canada Winter Games was the conversion of the temporary speed skating oval into a permanent facility for speed skating and outdoor public skating. In 2007, Kelly withdrew Halifax&#x27;s bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games over concerns about the rapidly escalating costs of the games.

He was instrumental in allowing a controversial $400,000 loan of public money for a Black Eyed Peas concert in 2010 which was not approved by HRM council or reviewed by the city&#x27;s legal department. The loan was not repaid when the promoter went out of business. In what became known in Halifax as the &quot;commons concert scandal&quot;, the region&#x27;s Auditor General found serious problems with the decision-making process and book-keeping for the concert loan to Power Promotional Events. The city was eventually able to recover much of the loan but is still owed approximately $359,550 from the deal.

During Kelly&#x27;s tenure the municipality adopted a new regional development plan in 2006 and an urban development plan for Downtown Halifax known as &quot;Halifax By Design&quot; in 2009. In November 2011, the city approved and began a long-delayed construction of a new central public library. Peter Kelly pushed for an expansion of a community centre in the nation&#x27;s largest African Canadian community of North Preston. Along with the community centre in North Preston, Kelly&#x27;s administration saw the construction of seven fire halls, five recreational complexes, the World Trade and Convention Centre. Also, he saw the construction of the Halifax Central Library.

Kelly apologized on behalf of the municipality for the razing of Africville, backing it up was a $5 million reparation plan for the black community, of which $3 million was paid by the city. In 2011 a commemorative church and interpretive centre was constructed as part of, what is now called the Africville Apology. Late in Kelly&#x27;s final term in office the municipality began the process of removal of the Cogswell Interchange.

Kelly&#x27;s role in the eviction of the NS Occupy Protests on Remembrance Day 2011 caused controversy. Occupy protesters agreed to temporarily move out of Halifax&#x27;s Grand Parade for the Remembrance Day ceremony and shifted their camp to Victoria Park. Kelly stated that he supported and respected the cooperation of protesters, offering an alternative location for the protest camp, but also supported the eviction and arrest of 14 protesters just minutes after the close of the Remembrance Day ceremonies. The eviction was approved by HRM council in a closed-door meeting chaired by Kelly on November 8. The decision to evict the protesters on a holiday weekend cost Halifax taxpayers an extra $106,000 in overtime costs. In response to charges that the city betrayed the trust of an agreement between the city, veterans and Occupy NS, Kelly stated that the decision was up to council and the eviction was an operational police matter.

===Executor of the will of Mary Thibeault===
Kelly is also criticized for his performance as the executor of the will of 91-year-old Mary Thibeault. Kelly was appointed as executor by Nova Scotia&#x27;s probate court as requested in Thibeault&#x27;s will. He was one of 18 heirs to the estate of about half a million dollars. The heirs which included several elderly people and charities waited eight years for the estate to be resolved, a process that usually takes 18 months. In June 2012 five of 18 beneficiaries had petitioned the province&#x27;s probate court to have Kelly removed as executor alleging he had taken nearly $150,000 from the estate and that the will was still not settled seven years after Thibeault&#x27;s death. In September 2012 the issue was resolved when Kelly agreed to step down after probate judge ordered him removed as Thibeault&#x27;s executor. While the matter was settled, Kelly later admitted the &quot;timeliness&quot; of the matter became an issue.

===Leaving politics===
On February 22, 2012, Kelly announced he would not be running in the fall 2012 mayoral race, citing personal reasons and stating &quot;It&#x27;s an acknowledgment that I screwed up personally.&quot;

===Return to private life===
Upon leaving public life Kelly began a consulting business, assisting developers with the municipal development process &quot;blending his insider’s knowledge of politics with his&quot; business experience and education. In July 2014 Kelly went to work with former mayor&#x27;s office staffer Stephen Taylor as a partner in Target Pest control, working in business development.

===CAO of Westlock County===
Westlock County, Alberta announced September 2, 2014 that after a Canada wide search it had hired Kelly as the county&#x27;s new Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). The Mayor of Westlock County stated that while he and county council had been aware of previous controversies from Kelly&#x27;s tenure as Mayor of Halifax, they still felt Kelly was &quot;the right choice.&quot; For his part, Kelly was unconcerned that the perception of financial impropriety might interfere in his new job, saying &quot;I have never taken any public money. I&#x27;m very honest. I&#x27;m very careful of my reputation and I try to make sure I protect it all costs. When it comes to public funds in this particular municipality, I will do whatever I can to make sure we maximize the dollars.&quot; Kelly served in this position until March 2016, leaving to become CAO of Charlottetown, PEI.

On July 7, 2016, Westlock County chief financial officer Sue Oberg told council that Kelly had approved $390,570 in un-budgeted expenses while CAO. The money was spent to develop a site in the North Horizon industrial park. Alberta&#x27;s Municipal Government Act allows council to determine how much spending a CAO is allowed to approve without council approval, which in Westlock County was $10,000. In his defence Kelly stated that he relied on the information provided by public works department staff to make his decisions, and the work on the lot was outlined in a lease agreement passed by council.

On August 10, 2016 it was reported that the Westlock County Council had voted to ask the Alberta Department of Municipal Affairs to conduct a Municipal Inspection regarding issues around Kelly&#x27;s role the Horizon North project among others.

When completed in July 2017 the report concluded Kelly breached the &quot;Alberta Municipal Government Act&quot; on a number of occasions. He was found to have allegedly shredded documents and worked simultaneously for the county and the City of Charlottetown, and bypassed county managers and directed a clerk to create and cancel invoices. In particular it stated &quot;In apparent enthusiasm for economic development, Kelly acted without proper authority and failed to advise council of their legislative responsibilities.&quot;

The report also found that the county under Kelly attempted to use blueprints for constructing Fawcett Fire Hall without respect for copyright. The inspectors stated that it appeared the Baptiste Lake Fire Hall drawing were being used as a cost saving measure to avoid hiring an engineer or architect.

Kelly responded that the report was &quot;lacking, disappointing and incomplete at best. Often appearing as inaccurate and biased.&quot; Kelly reiterated his position that he was acting on council direction contained in two motions regarding the lease, including one that approved the lease containing a clause in the lease agreement that outlined work to be done by the municipality. Kelly stated that documents were destroyed after he departed Westlock and as a result the investigators relied on interviews and allegations rather than facts.

===CAO of Charlottetown===
Kelly became CAO in Charlottetown on May 1, 2016. Speaking of the controversies surrounding Kelly&#x27;s term as mayor, Clifford Lee, Mayor of Charlottetown, defended the choice, saying &quot;I think he did a fantastic job for the citizens of Halifax.&quot;

Initially, Kelly was hired with a six-month probationary period, which was extended an additional six months when news of the Westlock investigation surfaced. Employment would be reviewed if he was convicted of violating any law. While retaining Kelly was defended by the Mayor and Councillor MacLeod, then chairing the city&#x27;s human resource committee, Councillor Jason Coady expressed concern about the decision to retain Kelly, while Councillor Bob Doiron called the hiring &quot;unnecessarily risky.&quot;

In October 2017 it was reported that Kelly was at the centre of increased labour unrest with city hall workers, who were exploring joining a larger union to better represent themselves. The number of grievances had increased dramatically and several city staffers pointed the finger at Kelly.

In December 2017 after an investigation by external HR consultants Kelly was found to have breached the Charlottetown&#x27;s harassment policy. Kelly was found to have breached the policy seven times in relation to complaints brought by City of Charlottetown public works superintendent, including directing an improper investigation into the complainants work, harassment and bullying, and a breach in confidentiality. While City Hall issued a statement that it remained confident in his decisions, Kelly will have to undergo workplace sensitivity training.

On January 23, 2019, it was announced that Deputy CAO Scott Messervey no longer worked with the City of Charlottetown, and at the time no reason for the departure was given.

On April 14, 2022, it was announced Kelly had fired Charlottetown&#x27;s Deputy CAO, Tina Lococo. CBC News reported that &quot;privately, several councillors expressed some level of shock or concern to CBC News at the fact Kelly has parted ways with another deputy who seemed well-qualified for the position, three years after the previous deputy CAO, Scott Messervey, was fired.&quot;. On April 24, 2022 CBC reported that in 2019 Messervey reportedly told City Council that Charlottetown &quot;was either breaking its own financial rules or not complying with the province&#x27;s Municipal Government Act&quot; but that Council chose to take &#x27;no further action.&#x27;.

Charlottetown Council voted 8-3 to fire Kelly without cause at their Wednesday, May 11 meeting, &#x27;effective immediately&#x27;.

==Personal life==
In September 2021, Kelly and Diana Girouard bought an oceanfront property on Eagle Head Road in Queens County, Nova Scotia. Development of the site has been controversial. In 2022, Kelly was fined by the Nova Scotia Department of Environment and Climate Change for altering a watercourse without approval. In October 2022, more than two dozen area residents filed a lawsuit against Kelly and Girouard in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, alleging that they had blocked a &quot;well-marked and commonly recognized right of way&quot; on their property.

<doc id="1144307" wikidata="Q6386869" url="?curid=1144307" title="Kembangan, Singapore">
<text>&quot;For a district in West Jakarta, Indonesia, see Kembangan, Jakarta&quot;


Kembangan ( ) is a subzone and residential precinct located in the town of Bedok in the East Region of Singapore. It consists largely of private residential areas and a small public housing estate along Lengkong Tiga.

==Etymology==
Kembangan means &quot;expansion&quot; in Malay. The road Jalan Kembangan was officially named in 1932.

==History==
Kembangan along with the wider Geylang district was badly hit by the September 1964 race riots and schools in the area had to be closed for an extended period despite other schools in Singapore reopening after the curfew was lifted. Later in the 1980s, the Malay villages of Kampong Kembangan and Kampong Pachitan, which used to stand at present day Kembangan estate, were demolished to make way for redevelopments in the area. Kampong Kembangan lies approximately to the east of the present day HDB flats in the estate, while Kampong Pachitan lie west of the flats. Several roads in the area were removed or realigned with the redevelopments that were in tandem with the construction of the MRT Line and station there.

==Amenities==

Kembangan is served by limited amenities like the Kembangan Plaza, which mainly consists of tuition centres, as well as shophouses around the estate. The social welfare of residents are catered for with facilities like the Kwan-In Welfare Free Clinic and the Moral Home for the Disabled in the area. The estate is served by the Kampong Kembangan Community Club, which also serves the wider Kembangan-Chai Chee constituency in the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency. The Siglap Park Connector which runs to either the Bedok Reservoir Park or the East Coast Park cuts through the area too. There are more amenities located in the nearby Chai Chee and Eunos estates.

The area also has multiple places of worship like the Bethesda Chapel, Mangala Vihara Buddhist Temple, Hong San Si Temple (樟宜凤山寺), Masjid Abdul Razak, Masjid Mydin and The Buddhist Union.

The area falls under the jurisdiction of the Kampong Kembangan Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP), which is part of the Bedok Police Division, and the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ.

== Education ==
There are currently no public government schools in the Kembangan estate. There is only a government funded school, the MINDS Towner Gardens School. It is the first purpose built special education school in Singapore, established since 1985. It has been operating from that location since December 1997.

=== Former schools ===
* Chin Hua School, from before 1936 to c.1970, formerly located at 503A Changi Road
* Kembangan Integrated Primary School (KIPS), from 1963 to 1987, formerly located at 2 Lengkong Satu the current site of MINDS School
* Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah, it formerly stood at where Muhammadiyah Association is today from c.1980s to 2005 and now stands at its present location in Toa Payoh
* Madrasah Alsagoff Al-Arabiah, it occupied the defunct KIPS premises from 1989 to 1992 and now stands at its present location in Kampong Glam
* Madrasah Irsyad or Madrasatul Irsyad Al Islamiyah from 1979, it is managed by Masjid Mydin and is not to be confused with the current Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah

== Transportation ==
The estate is served by the East West MRT line at the Kembangan MRT station. There are two bus services that serve the estate. They are service 42, which also serves the neighbouring Opera Estate, and service 135. There are more bus services to be found along the one directional Sims Avenue East that lies south of the estate, or the further Changi Road which runs in the opposite direction towards the city.

<text>MacPherson is a neighbourhood located within the district of Geylang in the Central Region of Singapore. Its location roughly corresponds to the identically titled subzone in the Geylang Planning Area and is approximately sandwiched between the neighbourhoods of Aljunied and Paya Lebar. MacPherson largely consists of various public housing estates centred on Circuit Road and an industrial area. The Pelton Canal runs through the neighbourhood, which separates a private housing estate off MacPherson Road, and the public housing estate along Circuit Road. 

Many residents in MacPherson are from the older generation, as the area was one of the first major public housing projects developed between the 1950s to 1970s. As a result, the majority of facilities in MacPherson are designed to be wheelchair and elderly-friendly. Nevertheless, in recent years, multiple built-to-order (BTO) public housing developments have been constructed, such as MacPherson Spring and MacPherson Weave, which are geared towards newly established young families.

The neighbourhood is served by MacPherson Community Club, operated by the People&#x27;s Association (PA) with Residents&#x27; Committee (RCs) and Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) scattered around the entire neighbourhood. These organisations facilitate various programmes to promote community involvement and interaction among residents. 

Politically, MacPherson is represented in Parliament as the MacPherson Single Member Constituency, with Tin Pei Ling of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) as its Member of Parliament (MP) since 2015.

==Etymology==
The area is also alternatively called Jalan Klapa, as the area historically ran through a coconut plantation. MacPherson Road was named after Colonel Ronald MacPherson (1817–1869). MacPherson was involved in the First Opium War of 1841 and was appointed Staff Officer to the Artillery in the Straits Settlements in 1843. He succeeded Colonel H. Man as Executive Engineer and Superintendent of Convicts and Resident Councillor, Malacca in 1855 and 1857 respectively. 

He had been active in forming a local volunteer corps at the outbreak of the Crimean War and was appointed First Captain Commandment of the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC) that was formed in 1854. When the first Municipal Act came into operation in 1856, he became an ex officio member of the Commission, becoming President on three later occasions. He was appointed the first Colonial Secretary when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony in 1867. 

MacPherson had also designed the current St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral along the lines of the ruined Netley Abbey in England and had built it in six years using forced penal labour sent over from the British Raj. Completed in 1862, the cathedral is considered one of the finest specimens of ecclesiastical architecture in the Far East. On the cathedral grounds, the architect is commemorated in a memorial called the MacPherson Memorial Monument. MacPherson died in 1869 and was subsequently buried at the old Bukit Timah Road Christian Cemetery, by which around this time Jalan Klapa was subsequently renamed in commemoration. The cemetery today has since been landscaped and made into a park.

The name Macpherson itself – or MacPherson or McPherson, according to different spellings – is believed to have come from the Gaelic Mac a&#x27; phearsain and means &#x27;Son of the parson&#x27;. For some old folks it was called Persiaran Keliling.

== Religion ==
The neighbourhood is served by religious sites such as churches, temples and mosques. They include Trinity Christian Centre, Grace Baptist Church, Sallim Mattar Mosque and Huang Lao Xian Shi Temple. These religious organisations often have charity extensions and are actively serving the needy in the MacPherson neighbourhood.

== Parks and greenspace ==
Parks and recreational facilities are distributed around the neighbourhood, with the main park being the Pelton Park Connector, which stretches the entire distance from Balam Road to Paya Lebar Way. There are also larger parks such as the Aljunied Park located near the neighbourhood.

== Education ==
The Ministry of Education has a total of 4 mainstream Primary and Secondary Schools in MacPherson, Singapore. They are Geylang Methodist School (Primary), Geylang Methodist School (Secondary), Canossa Catholic Primary School, and St. Margaret&#x27;s Primary School, which is temporarily relocated here for improvements work to be conducted on their old campus. There is also a school for special needs students, called Canossian School.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
The neighbourhood is served by the Circle MRT line and Downtown MRT line at MacPherson MRT station and Mattar MRT station. 

=== Healthcare===
The neighbourhood is served by the Geylang Polyclinic, which is operated by the National Healthcare Group (NHG). There are also many private general practitioners around the neighbourhood, usually located below the public housing flats.

The nearest shopping malls are 18 Tai Seng, Paya Lebar Square, and Paya Lebar Quarter. The majority of the shopping options here in MacPherson are located in the markets or along the HDB shophouses.

==Hawker food culture ==
A distinctive identity of MacPherson from the rest of Singapore are its hawker food culture. The neighbourhood&#x27;s hawker centres are often featured and patronised by local media as well as food bloggers, including international ones. In particular, five distinctive and large hawker centres located in MacPherson encompasses the entire neighbourhood. 

To cater to the diversity of races and religions in MacPherson, and Singapore in general, they serve unique dishes stemming from Singaporean cuisine which had been created by the local Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian communities. Most notably, the hawker centres that have been intensively featured by the news and on social media are 79 and 79A Circuit Road Hawker Centre, as well as the two-storey complex located at 80 Circuit Road Food Centre. 

Although hawker centres are widespread throughout the country, the allure towards MacPherson are due to the fact that the majority of the hawker stall owners are older and would prepare their food in the traditional styles, and due to the demographics of MacPherson, the cost of food is also lower for more widespread affordability. However, there is also a trend of newer hawkers, typically of a younger age, starting out their first hawker stall which sells regional Asian cuisines, such as Japanese and Thai cuisine.

<text>In international relations, the security dilemma (also referred to as the spiral model) is when the increase in one state&#x27;s security (such as increasing its military strength) leads other states to fear for their own security (because they do not know if the security-increasing state intends to use its growing military for offensive purposes). Consequently, security-increasing measures can lead to tensions, escalation or conflict with one or more other parties, producing an outcome which no party truly desires; a political instance of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.

The security dilemma is particularly intense in situations when (1) it is hard to distinguish offensive weapons from defensive weapons, and (2) offense has the advantage in any conflict over defense. Military technology and geography strongly affect the offense-defense balance.

The term was first coined by the German scholar John H. Herz in a 1950 study. At the same time British historian Herbert Butterfield described the same situation in his &quot;History and Human Relations&quot;, but referred to it as the &quot;absolute predicament and irreducible dilemma&quot;. The security dilemma is a key concept in international relations theory, in particular among realist scholars to explain how security-seeking states can end up in conflict.

== Basic components ==
Tang identified the following core components between interpretations of the security dilemma by Herbert Butterfield, John H. Herz, and Robert Jervis:

Butterfield viewed the security dilemma as the root cause of all war, but he did not view anarchy as being the ultimate source of the security dilemma. Instead he attributed the source to fear and the &quot;universal sin&quot; of humanity — that humanity can commit evil. Herz and Jervis did not view the security dilemma as being the root cause of all war. A counterexample frequently given is the Second World War, where there was no dilemma over war with a malign Nazi Germany.

==Defensive realism==
The security dilemma is the core assumption of defensive realism. According to Kenneth Waltz, because the world does not have a common government and is &quot;anarchic&quot;, survival is the main motivation of states. States are distrustful of other states&#x27; intentions and as a consequence always try to maximize their own security. The security dilemma explains why security-seeking (as opposed to non-security seeking) states could end up in conflict, even though they have benign intentions.

The offense-defense balance accounts for why the security dilemma is more intense in certain circumstances. Defensive realists argue that in situations where offensive actions have the advantage (for example, due to geography or military technology), the security dilemma will be particularly intensive because states will be more distrustful of each other and be more encouraged to take preemptive offensive actions. In situations where the defense has the advantage, security-seeking states can afford to focus strictly on their defense without as much fear of being attacked. Security-seeking states can also signal benign intentions without adversely affecting their own security. 

Defensive realists often regard the success of the United States in World War I as being a result of the defensive approach taken by the United States. Had the United States taken an offensive stance, defensive realists argue that the United States would not have been secure. The conclusion from defensive realism is that in some circumstances states can escape the security dilemma.

==Offensive realism==
Offensive realism and defensive realism are variants of structural realism. They share the basic beliefs of survivalism, statism (state as the primary unit), self-help and anarchy. (See international relations theory.) However, contrary to defensive realism, offensive realism regards states as aggressive power maximizers and not as security maximizers. According to John Mearsheimer, &quot;Uncertainty about the intentions of other states is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive capabilities&quot;. According to Mearsheimer, though achieving hegemony by any state is not likely in today&#x27;s international system, there is no such thing as a status quo and &quot;the world is condemned to perpetual great power competition&quot;.

Supporting the belief that the international system is anarchic and that each state must independently seek its own survival, Waltz argues that weaker states try to find a balance with their rivals and to form an alliance with a stronger state to obtain a guarantee of security against offensive action by an enemy state. On the other hand, Mearsheimer and other offensive realists argue that anarchy encourages all states to always increase their own power because one state can never be sure of other states&#x27; intentions. In other words, defensive realism contends that security can be balanced in some cases and that the security dilemma is escapable. While offensive realists do not disagree, they do not agree fully with the defensive view instead contending that if states can gain an advantage over other states then they will do so. In short, since states want to maximize their power in this anarchic system and since states cannot trust one another, the security dilemma is inescapable.

Offensive realists dispute that the offense-defense is a major determinant of state behavior, arguing the concept is vague, that offense and defense cannot be distinguished, that the offense-defense balance does not vary significantly over time, perceptions among leaders of the offense-defense balance varies even within the same time periods, and attackers and defender can use most types of weapons to achieve their goals.

==Offense–defense theory==
The offense–defense theory of Robert Jervis helps decide the intensity of the security dilemma. Jervis uses four scenarios to describe the intensity of the security dilemma:

* When offensive and defensive behaviour are not distinguishable but offense has an advantage, the security dilemma is &quot;very intense&quot; and environment is &quot;doubly dangerous&quot;. Status quo states will behave in an aggressive manner and they will arise the possibility of an arms race. Chances of cooperation between states are low.
* Where offensive and defensive behavior are not distinguishable but defense has an advantage, the security dilemma is &quot;intense&quot; in explaining states&#x27; behaviour but not as intense as in the first case. In such situation, a state might be able to increase its security without being a threat to other states and without endangering the security of other states.
* Where offensive and defensive behavior are distinguishable but offense has an advantage, the security dilemma is &quot;not intense&quot; but security issues exist. The environment is safe, but offensive behaviour has an advantage that might result in aggression at some future time.
* Where offensive and defensive behavior are distinguishable and defense has advantage, the security dilemma has little or no intensity, and the environment is &quot;doubly safe&quot;. Since there is little danger of offensive action by other states, a state would be able to expend some of its defense budget and other resources on useful development within the state.

According to Jervis, the technical capabilities of a state and its geographical position are two essential factors in deciding whether offensive or defensive action is advantageous. He argues that at a strategic level, technical and geographical factors are of greater favor to the defender. For example, in the 19th century railway and roads construction were rapidly changing the composition of capabilities of states to attack or defend themselves from other states. Thus, considerable effort in diplomatic relations and intelligence were specifically focused on this issue.

The spiral model identifies the next step in reasoning about states&#x27; behavior after identifying the intensity of the security dilemma. In particular, under given circumstances of the security dilemma, what steps might a threatened state take to derive advantage by attacking first. In other words, the spiral model seeks to explain war. In the spiral model of Jervis, there are two reasons why a state might end up in war. Preventive war might take place as one state might decide to attack first when it perceives the balance of power shifting to the other side creating an advantage in attacking sooner rather than later as conditions may not be as favorable in the future as in the present. Preemptive war might take place as a state might decide to attack another state first to prevent the other state from attacking or to obstruct the other state&#x27;s attack because it fears the other state is preparing to attack.

The deterrence model is contrary to the spiral model, but also purports to explain war. While the spiral model presumes that states are fearful of each other, the deterrence model is based on the belief that states are greedy. Paul K. Huth divides deterrence into three main types:

* Preventing armed attack against a country&#x27;s own territory (&quot;direct deterrence&quot;)
* Preventing armed attack against the territory of another country (&quot;extended deterrence&quot;)
* Using deterrence against a short-term threat of attack (&quot;immediate deterrence&quot;)

Under some circumstances attempts at deterrence can &quot;backfire&quot; when a potential attacker misinterprets the state&#x27;s deterrence measures as a &quot;prelude to offensive measures&quot;. In such cases the security dilemma can arise generating perceptions of a &quot;first strike advantage&quot;. According to Huth &quot;most effective deterrence policies are those that decrease the expected utility of using force while not reducing the expected utility of the status quo; optimally deterrent policies would even increase the utility of not using the force.&quot; It is more likely that deterrence will succeed if the attacker finds deterrence threat &quot;credible&quot; and a credible deterrence threat might not necessarily be a military threat.

Jervis claims that the security dilemma can lead to arms races and alliance formation.

===Arms race===
According to Robert Jervis, since the world is anarchic, a state might, for defensive purposes, build its military capability. However, since states are not aware of each other&#x27;s intentions, other states might interpret a defensive buildup as offensive; if so and if offensive action against the state that is only building its defenses is advantageous, the other states might prefer to take an aggressive stance, which will &quot;make the situation unstable&quot;. In such situation, an arms race may become a strong possibility. Robert Jervis gives the example of Germany and Britain before World War I. &quot;Much of the behaviour in this period was the product of technology and beliefs that magnified the security dilemma&quot;. In that example, strategists believed that offense would be more advantageous than defense, but that ultimately turned out to not be the case. Competition on nuclear weapons construction between the United States and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War, is a well-known example of an arms race.

===Alliance formation===
The security dilemma might force states to form new alliances or to strengthen existing alliances. &quot;If offense has less advantage, stability and cooperation are likely&quot;. According to Glenn H. Snyder, under a security dilemma there are two reasons that alliances will form. First, a state that is dissatisfied with the amount of security it has forms alliances in order to bolster its security. Second, a state is in doubt about the reliability of existing allies in coming to its aid, and thus decides to court another ally or allies. According to Thomas Christensen and Jack Snyder, in a multipolar world two types of alliance dilemma exist which are contrary in nature. These alliance dilemmas are known as chain ganging and buck passing.

====Chain ganging====
In a multipolar world, alliance security is interconnected. When one ally decides to participate in war, it pulls its alliance partners into the war too, which is referred to as chain ganging. If the partner does not participate in the war fully, it will endanger the security of its ally. For example, in World War I, to the alliance between Austria-Hungary and Germany, according to Waltz, did this: &quot;If Austria-Hungary marched, Germany had to follow: the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire would have left Germany alone in the middle of Europe&quot;. On the other side, if &quot;France marched, Russia had to follow; a German victory over France would be a defeat for Russia. And so it was all around the vicious circle, because the defeat or defection of a major alliance would have shaken the balance, each alliance partner would have shaken the balance, each state was constrained to adjust its strategy&quot;.

====Buck passing====
In the face of a rising threat, balancing alignments fail to form in a timely fashion as states try to freeride on other states. States might do so to avoid the expense of war for themselves. For example, to use Waltz&#x27;s example, in World War II, the French Foreign Minister told the British Prime Minister that Britain was justified in taking &quot;the lead in opposing Germany&quot; when the Nazis had taken over the Rhineland, but as &quot;the German threat grew&quot;, France and Britain hoped that Germany and the Soviet Union &quot;would balance each other off or fight to the finish. Uncertainties about... who will gain or lose from the action of other states accelerate as number of states increases&quot;.

==Criticisms and responses==
According to Alexander Wendt, &quot;Security dilemmas are not given by anarchy or nature&quot; but, rather, are &quot;a social structure composed of intersubjective understandings in which states are so distrustful that they make worst-case assumptions about each other&#x27;s intentions&quot;. Jennifer Mitzen mirrors Wendt&#x27;s critique, arguing that the security dilemma can be caused and maintained by the pursuit for ontological security rather than rationalist security-seeking.

Glaser argues that Wendt mischaracterised the security dilemma. &quot;Wendt is using the security dilemma to describe the result of states&#x27; interaction whereas Jervis and the literature he has spawned use the security dilemma to refer to a situation created by the material conditions facing states, such as geography and prevailing technology&quot;. According to Wendt because the security dilemma is the result of one state&#x27;s interaction with another, a state can adopt policies which hinder the security dilemma. Glaser blames Wendt for &quot;exaggerating the extent to which structural realism calls for competitive policies and, therefore, the extent to which it leads to security dilemmas&quot;. Glaser argues that though offensive realists presume that in an international system a state has to compete for power, the security dilemma is a concept mainly used by defensive realists and according to defensive realists it is beneficial for nations to cooperate under certain circumstances.

Another mode of criticism of the security dilemma concept is to question the validity of the offence-defense balance. Since weapons of offense and of defense are the same, how can the distinction between the two be connected with a state&#x27;s intentions? As a result, critics have questioned whether the offense-defense balance can be used as a variable in explaining international conflicts. 

According to Charles Glaser, criticisms of the offense-defense balance are based on two misunderstandings. First, the sameness or difference of offensive weapons compared with defensive weapons does not impact the offense-defense balance itself. Offense-defense theory assumes that both parties in conflict will use those weapons that suit their strategy and goals. Second, whether both states involved in the conflict have some common weapons between them is the wrong question to ask in seeking to understand the offense-defense balance. Instead, critics should focus on the influence or net effect of weapons used in the conflict. According to Glaser, &quot;Distinguishability should be defined by comparative net assessment&quot; or the comparison of the balance of offense-defense when both sides use weapons versus when neither side is using weapons.

<doc id="1144321" wikidata="Q691661" url="?curid=1144321" title="Southern Expressway, Adelaide">
<text>Southern Expressway is an freeway through the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. It is the southern part of the North–South Corridor which extends the full length of Adelaide and is being built to urban freeway standard. It is designated part of route M2.

The Southern Expressway was built as a corridor to relieve heavy traffic from the major arterial, Main South Road, in Adelaide&#x27;s south. It was originally built as a reversible one way freeway, and was the world&#x27;s longest after its completion in 2001. Between 2010 and 2014, it was expanded and it is now a regular 2-direction freeway.

Construction of the expressway included the Adelaide Southern Veloway for cyclists, which runs alongside it for 7 km, from Marion/Main South Road to the Reynella Interchange. South of the Reynella Interchange, the bikeway becomes a shared track for the remaining 12 km of the expressway. The expressway crosses over the Coast to Vines Rail Trail at both Panalatinga Road and at the expressway&#x27;s southern end.

==Route==
The Southern Expressway starts in the central median of South Road in St Marys. It continues southwest in a lowered trench between the carriageways of South Road, until it crosses the Sturt River. It continues in a south-westerly direction in its own alignment, running roughly parallel to Main South Road through Reynella. It ends at an intersection with Main South Road just north of Old Noarlunga.

==History==
===Pre-construction===

The expressway is the southern part of a north–south freeway originally conceptualised under the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS), completed in 1965, as a freeway bypassing the city from Dry Creek to Old Noarlunga. The MATS plan proved unpopular, and in 1971 all further highway construction in Adelaide was postponed for a period of ten years. In 1983 plans for a freeway north of Darlington were abandoned, and the land that had been set aside was progressively sold off.

In 1984 the state government announced plans to develop a &quot;third arterial road&quot; for the south. In 1987 the project was split into two phases. The first was the upgrading of Main South Road and Marion Road in the Darlington area, and the second was a new road from Darlington to Reynella. Phase one was completed in 1994 with the widening of Main South Road to eight lanes between Ayliffes Road and Seacombe Road, and the widening of Marion Road to six lanes between Main South Road and Sturt Road.

Phase 2 became the expressway, which was constructed in two stages: from Darlington to Reynella, and from Reynella to Old Noarlunga. It was developed as a one-way reversible road, with future duplication provided for in the roadworks base, to be constructed when the need arose. It used the remaining &quot;Noarlunga Freeway&quot; reservation, except for the northernmost kilometre, where a new route through O&#x27;Halloran Hill was chosen to provide high-quality links with Marion and Main South Roads without interfering with existing infrastructure at Sturt.

===Construction of the reversible freeway===
Construction of the expressway commenced in July 1995. The first stage was opened to traffic in December 1997. Construction commenced on the second stage in February 1999. It was opened to traffic in September 2001. The total cost of the reversible freeway was A$76.5m.

==== Promotional FM radio transmitter ====
During its construction and for some time after its opening, the expressway was promoted via a dedicated FM radio station established by the Department of Transport, broadcasting via a low-power FM transmitter in the immediate vicinity of the road. The radio station broadcast a recorded message on continuous loop featuring promotional and community information messages relating to the expressway, including a jingle that Transport Minister Diana Laidlaw declared made the expressway the only road in the world to have its own jingle.

===Operation as a one way road===
Until 2014, the expressway was open approximately 21 hours per day, one way for over 10 hours in each direction. The northbound (city-bound) direction occurred on weekday mornings (2:00 am – 12:30 pm) and weekend evenings (2:00 pm – 12:30 am). The southbound direction was open on weekday evenings (2:00 pm – 12:30 am) and weekend mornings (2:00 am – 12:30 pm). 

It was closed 12:30–2:00 am and 12:30–2:00 pm. Exceptions were Saturday and Monday mornings, when the direction remained unchanged. Weekday public holidays operated under the weekend&#x27;s opening times to accommodate tourists travelling to the Fleurieu Peninsula. During each closure all road signs, lights and boom gates changed over, and the road was inspected by a tow truck contractor for debris and car breakdowns.

===Duplication===
In 2007, the Howard government pledged $100m towards widening the expressway in its unsuccessful re-election bid.

In February 2010, during the state election campaign, Premier Mike Rann announced that, if re-elected, the expressway would be duplicated in a A$445m project. The inclusion of a new A$75m interchange at Darlington was later scrapped, after the government planning for a major transport hub at Darlington discovered the need for a $50 million section of road that would have to be destroyed when the expressway was eventually duplicated.

Once duplication was announced in 2010, construction started in 2011. Due to the duplication of the Expressway, all of the bridges had to be widened to meet the new width of the road. Some road bridges were closed during the work needed, and others required a temporary lower speed limit for safety reasons. This caused some anger to residents and businesses.

The new road was built entirely on the western side of the original roadway. It is four lanes wide between Reynella and Marion Road in the northbound. Accessibility has been improved, with completely new intersections at Beach Road and Sheriffs Road, as well as being able to left turn out at Old Noarlunga, a right turn out at Marion Road, and a left turn in at Marion Road.

The expressway opened to two-way traffic in August 2014 and a cost of about A$400m.

=== Darlington Upgrade ===
In 2014, the plans for an interchange at Darlington were revived and expanded to extend the Southern Expressway through Darlington. The original project scope was to extend the expressway with a lowered motorway corridor. The corridor passing underneath Flinders Drive (access to Flinders University and Flinders Medical Centre), Sturt Road and a bridge connecting local streets Mimosa Terrace and Sutton Road, to the intersection of South Road, Ayliffes Road and Shepherds Hill Road with surface-level service roads and segregated cycling and pedestrian paths.

The project was later revised to continue the extension past Tonsley, giving a total length of 3.3 kilometres. A road bridge, accessible from the Main South Road surface road and the lowered motorway, allows northbound traffic free-flowing access to Ayliffes Road. The associated Flinders Link Project extended the Tonsley railway line over this corridor to Flinders Medical Centre.

Early works commenced late in 2014. Gateway South, a joint venture of Fulton Hogan and Laing O&#x27;Rourke was awarded the major works contract for the project in January 2016. Major works commenced in 2016 for an expected project completion in 2018, later revised to December 2019. 

Completion was delayed to 2020 due to sections of the lowered motorway wall collapsing. Construction was completed and the lowered motorway fully opened to traffic in August 2020. Final road surfacing was completed in late November through to early December 2020.

===Majors Road interchange===
Following the 2022 South Australian state election, the incoming Malinauskas government initiated the addition of an exit at Majors Road near the top of the first climb up from the Adelaide Plains. The project was expected to cost $120 million, equally funded by state and federal governments. Completion was expected to be by the end of 2025.

<doc id="1144327" wikidata="Q740559" url="?curid=1144327" title="Graftgold">
<text>Graftgold was an independent computer game developer that came to prominence in the 1980s, producing numerous computer games on a variety of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit platforms.

==History==

===The Hewson era===
Graftgold was originally ST Software starting in 1983 when Steve Turner quit his day job as a commercial programmer to concentrate on develop computer games for the Spectrum. He hired a close friend, Andrew Braybrook, to work for him initially to convert the games to the Dragon home computer, When the Dragon disappeared from the market Andrew started to develop on the more lucrative Commodore 64. ST Software became a limited company with the name Graftgold in 1984.

Much of Graftgold&#x27;s early success came about through their association with Hewson Consultants. Formed by Andrew Hewson in the early 1980s, Hewson Consultants became one of the UK&#x27;s most successful computer game publishers. Whereas many publishers at the time relied on larger parent companies to handle the manufacturing of their products, Andrew Hewson owned his own cassette duplication plant, affording them much greater control over their ability to respond to market trends. Many of Graftgold&#x27;s most memorable titles were published by Hewson, including &quot;Paradroid&quot;, &quot;Uridium&quot;, &quot;Quazatron&quot;, and &quot;Ranarama&quot;.

===The Telecomsoft era===
Towards the end of the 1980s, it became apparent that Hewson Consultants suffered financial difficulties. Steve Turner decided it would be in Graftgold&#x27;s best interest to seek another publisher. They left their partnership with Hewson and signed a publishing deal with Telecomsoft, the software division of British Telecom. Two of Hewson&#x27;s in-house programmers, Dominic Robinson and John Cumming left the company to join Graftgold.

Hewson was not happy to see their most successful development partner leave, particularly because Graftgold was due to deliver two keenly anticipated titles&quot;Magnetron&quot; (by Steve Turner for the ZX Spectrum) and &quot;Morpheus&quot; (by Andrew Braybrook for the C64). Graftgold argued that since they were not contracted to Hewson, they were within their rights to seek an alternative publisher. Unable to sustain a legal battle, Hewson eventually settled with Telecomsoft out of court and parted company with Graftgold.

Graftgold produced several titles for Telecomsoft from 1987 until 1989, including their first arcade conversion, &quot;Flying Shark&quot;. However, the sale of Telecomsoft to MicroProse in 1989 resulted in their critically acclaimed conversion of &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; being eventually released by Ocean Software.

===The MicroProse/Activision era===
The dawn of the 1990s saw a shift in the way computer games were developed. Whereas the games of the 8-bit era were typically developed by a single individual within a matter of weeks to months, the more demanding 16-bit titles required larger teams, longer development times and considerably larger budgets. Royalties from their impressive catalogue of titles allowed Graftgold to make this transition with ease, hiring 30 additional people to work on a large number of products.

Graftgold&#x27;s path through the 16-bit era, however, would remain rocky. Deals with Hewson Consultants and Activision proved disastrous. Hewson&#x27;s liquidation forced them to sell the publishing rights for &quot;Paradroid 90&quot; to Activision. While the game sold an average number of copies on the Amiga and Atari ST, a PC Engine version that had been in development was shelved. To make matters worse, Graftgold had also been developing &quot;Realms&quot;, an expensive real-time strategy game, for Activision when it was announced that the publishing giant was in severe financial difficulty and had begun closing down many of its international operations. No longer contracted to develop any titles for MicroProse, the future of Graftgold looked bleak.

===The Virgin/Renegade era===
Graftgold’s salvation came from Virgin Interactive. Graftgold already had a working relationship with Virgin through their development of &quot;Super Off Road&quot;. Having repurchased the rights for &quot;Realms&quot; from Activision, Graftgold finished the game for Virgin. From 1991 to 1993, Graftgold concentrated on Sega&#x27;s primary gaming platforms—the Master System, Game Gear and Mega Drive—developing and converting numerous titles for these consoles for Virgin.

As Graftgold was developing Sega games for Virgin, Graftgold also struck up a publishing deal with Renegade. Renegade salvaged a number of products that had initially been promised to Mirrorsoft, publishing both Graftgold&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; platform game on multiple platforms and &quot;Uridium 2&quot; on the Amiga.

Somewhere between the early and mid-1990s, two things happened which would prove to be the beginning of the end for Graftgold. The 8-bit console formats stopped being viable as the Nintendo Entertainment System and Master System made way for 16-bit consoles. As a consequence, Graftgold&#x27;s 8-bit conversion work was stopped. The Amiga and Atari ST were also becoming obsolete as gaming platforms. By the time Graftgold had completed all their contractual obligations for the 8-bit consoles and 16-bit computers, it was already too late to establish a significant foothold within the 16-bit console market. Graftgold would only develop one title apiece for the Mega Drive and Super NES (&quot;Ottifants&quot; and &quot;Empire Soccer 94&quot;, respectively, although the latter would remain unpublished).

The fledgling PlayStation market remained a difficult nut to crack. Just as the transition from 8-bit to 16-bit had escalated development costs and required a significant expansion of resources, so too did the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit platforms. PlayStation development kits were notoriously expensive. Graftgold were able to afford enough to allow them to begin development on &quot;International MotoX&quot; and a PlayStation conversion of &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;. Still, they could not afford to develop any other titles. Their finances now depended on these two titles.

===The Warner/Perfect era===
Renegade, who owned the publishing rights for &quot;International MotoX&quot;, was eventually acquired by Time Warner Interactive, but the Warner company soon began to reconsider their software publishing strategy. Graftgold&#x27;s game was finished but remained unpublished for six months. By the time it was finally released, it had made enough profit to cover the large advances afforded to Graftgold, but very little extra income beyond that. &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; (packaged with a conversion of &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;) failed to ignite the interest of PlayStation gamers.

With very little income coming their way from their two PlayStation titles, Graftgold found it difficult to develop &quot;Hardcorps&quot;, the one title they were contracted to produce for a little-known publisher by the name of Coconuts. With an advance far below what was required to finance the game&#x27;s production, Graftgold began laying off staff. An eleventh-hour rescue bid from another developer, Perfect 10 Productions (responsible for the highly successful &quot;Discworld&quot; adventure games), helped finance Graftgold long enough to seek out an alternative publishing deal for &quot;Hardcorps&quot; with Psygnosis, but this fell through after numerous delays.

Graftgold finally folded in 1998.

In 2014 Steve Turner appeared in the documentary feature film &quot;From Bedrooms to Billions&quot; (2014), a film that tells the story of the British video game industry from 1979 to present.

==Key personnel==

===Steve Turner===

After leaving a job in commercial programming in 1982, Steve Turner decided to concentrate on freelance computer game development. Initially forming a company called ST Software, Turner rechristened the company Graftgold after employing his friend, Andrew Braybrook, to assist him with programming duties.

Turner&#x27;s solo projects for Graftgold included &quot;3D Space Wars&quot;, &quot;Astroclone&quot;, &quot;Quazatron&quot;, &quot;Ranarama&quot; and &quot;Magnetron&quot; for the ZX Spectrum. He later contributed towards most of Graftgold&#x27;s later projects on the 16-bit and 32-bit platforms.

Since the demise of Graftgold, Turner has continued to work in the IT industry.

===Andrew Braybrook===

After a brief stint programming games for the Dragon home computer, Braybrooks chief success was the publication of &quot;Gribbly&#x27;s Day Out&quot; by Hewson in 1985. The game combined elements of platform games and shoot-&#x27;em ups with colorful, cartoon-like graphics.

Towards the end of 1985 came Braybrook&#x27;s &quot;Paradroid&quot;. Regarded by many C64 gamers as one of the greatest games ever made, &quot;Paradroid&quot; was a shoot-&#x27;em up that featured exceptionally intelligent enemies, unique gameplay and fast-scrolling bas relief graphics that were quickly emulated by many other developers.

Two more Braybrook games arrived in 1986. &quot;Uridium&quot; was a horizontally scrolling shoot-&#x27;em up that required the player to navigate the hazardous surface of a number of colossal dreadnaughts, strafing targets whilst simultaneously avoiding waves of fighters that screamed past at blistering speeds. &quot;Alleykat&quot; arrived later in the year. Balanced somewhere between a vertically scrolling racer and a shoot-&#x27;em up, the game (while technically impressive) proved to be exceptionally difficult and disappointed a significant percentage of Braybrook&#x27;s fan base.

Braybrook&#x27;s next title, &quot;Morpheus&quot;, was published by Rainbird (Telecomsoft) in 1987. Combining elements of resource development games and the time-honoured shoot-&#x27;em up, &quot;Morpheus&quot; was Braybrook&#x27;s most adventurous game to date. Despite intriguing gameplay and impressive graphics, the high learning curve and somewhat experimental gameplay translated into poor sales. The last of Braybrook&#x27;s classic C64 titles, &quot;Intensity&quot;, arrived in 1988. A slightly more strategic shoot-&#x27;em up, the game enjoyed modest success.

Braybrook went on to develop a number of titles for the Amiga, including the conversion of &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; and sequels to &quot;Paradroid&quot; and &quot;Uridium&quot; before joining the rest of the Graftgold team developing their 16-bit and 32-bit titles. Braybrook remained with Graftgold until the company&#x27;s demise in 1998, at which time he was working on PC and PlayStation versions of &quot;Hardcorps&quot;. He then worked for a UK-based insurance company writing and deploying software until 2022, when he retired. He is now developing PC games.

===Dominic Robinson===

Dominic Robinson came to prominence as an in-house programmer for Hewson when he converted &quot;Uridium&quot; to the Spectrum (a feat previously considered unlikely) in 1986. This was followed by another classic Spectrum shoot-&#x27;em up, &quot;Zynaps&quot;, and a puzzle/shooter, &quot;Anarchy&quot;, both of which were released in 1987. After leaving Hewson, he joined Graftgold to work on the Spectrum conversion of &quot;Flying Shark&quot;, as well as the Amiga and Atari ST versions of &quot;Simulcra&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;.

<doc id="1144328" wikidata="Q1373946" url="?curid=1144328" title="Internet Explorer for Mac">
<text>Internet Explorer for Mac (also referred to as Internet Explorer for Macintosh, Internet Explorer Macintosh Edition, Internet Explorer:mac or IE:mac) was a proprietary web browser developed by Microsoft for the Macintosh platform to browse web pages. Initial versions were developed from the same code base as Internet Explorer for Windows. Later versions diverged, particularly with the release of version 5, which included the cutting-edge, fault-tolerant and highly standards-compliant Tasman layout engine.

As a result of the five-year agreement between Apple and Microsoft in 1997, it was the default browser on the classic Mac OS and Mac OS X from 1998 until it was superseded by Apple&#x27;s own Safari web browser in 2003 with the release of Mac OS X 10.3 &quot;Panther&quot;.

On June 13, 2003, Microsoft announced that it was ceasing further development of Internet Explorer for Mac and the final update was released on July 11, 2003. The browser was not included in the default installation of Mac OS X 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; which was released on April 29, 2005. Microsoft stopped releases for the product on December 31, 2005, and they removed the application from their Macintosh downloads site on January 31, 2006. Microsoft recommended &quot;that users migrate to more recent web browsing technologies such as Apple&#x27;s Safari.&quot; An archived version of the download is available on Softonic.com, but only works on Mac OS X 10.6 and earlier versions, because of the discontinuation of Rosetta. A Microsoft browser would not return to the macOS platform until Microsoft Edge in 2019.

==History==
Versions of Internet Explorer for Macintosh were released starting with version 2 in 1996, to version 5 which received its last patch in 2003. IE versions for Mac typically lagged several months to a year behind Windows versions, but included some unique developments, including its own layout engine, called Tasman.

===Internet Explorer 2.0 for Macintosh===

The first version of Internet Explorer for the Macintosh operating system was a beta version of &quot;Internet Explorer 2.0 for Macintosh&quot;, released on January 23, 1996, as a free download from Microsoft&#x27;s website. This first version was based on the Spyglass Mosaic web browser licensed from Spyglass. Available for both 68k and PPC based Macs running System 7.0.1 or later, it supported the embedding of a number of multimedia formats into web pages, including AVI and QuickTime formatted video and AIFF and WAV formatted audio. The final version was released three months later on April 23. Version 2.1 released in August of the same year, was mostly aimed at fixed bugs and improving stability, but also added a few features such as support for the NPAPI (the first version of Internet Explorer on any platform to do so) and support for QuickTime VR. AOL 3.0 for Macintosh used the IE 2.1 rendering engine in its built-in web browser.

===Internet Explorer 3.0 for Macintosh===

On November 5, 1996, Microsoft announced the release of a beta version of &quot;Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Macintosh&quot;. This release added support for HTML version 3.2, Cascading Style Sheets, Java applets and ActiveX controls. The final version, made available on January 8, 1997, also added support for the SSL and NTLM security protocols and the PICS and RSACi rating systems that can be used to control access to websites based on content ratings. A problem with an operating system extension used in the Mac OS, called CFM68K Runtime Enabler, led to a delay in the release of the version 3.0 for Macs based on the 68k line of processors. Four months later on May 14, Microsoft released version 3.01 which included a version for 68k-based machines. This version also included features from the Windows version of Internet Explorer 4.0 such as AutoComplete and Monitoring Favorites that notified users when sites in their Favorites list have been updated. It also included support for JavaScript and introduced a Download Manager and a Cookie Manager.

===Internet Explorer 4.0 for Macintosh===

At the 1997 Macworld Expo in Boston, on August 6, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates announced a partnership between Microsoft and Apple. Amongst other things, Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer the default browser instead of Netscape Navigator.

Five months later on January 6, 1998, at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco, Microsoft announced the release of the final version of &quot;Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Macintosh&quot;. Version 4 included support for offline browsing, Dynamic HTML, a new faster Java virtual machine and Security Zones that allow users or administrators to limit access to certain types of web content depending on which zone (for example Intranet or Internet) the content was coming from. The most publicized feature of Internet Explorer 4.0 was support for Microsoft&#x27;s Active Channel technology, which was intended to deliver regularly updated content that users could personally tailor to their interests. However Active Channel failed to reach a wide audience.

At the same event, Apple announced the release of Mac OS 8.1. This was the first version of the Macintosh operating system to bundle Internet Explorer as its default browser per the agreement with Microsoft; however, version 4.0 was not ready in time to be included so version 3.01 was bundled on the CDs.

At the following year&#x27;s San Francisco Macworld Expo on January 9, 1999, Microsoft announced the release of &quot;Internet Explorer 4.5 Macintosh Edition&quot;. This new version, which dropped 68K processor support, introduced Form AutoFill, Print Preview, the Page Holder pane which let a user hold a page of links on one side of the screen that opened pages in the right hand and support for Mac OS technology like Sherlock.

===Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition===
Another year later, on January 5, 2000, Microsoft announced a new version of Internet Explorer at the San Francisco Macworld Expo, &quot;Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition&quot; which was released two months later on March 27, 2000. The Windows version of Internet Explorer 5 had been released a year earlier, but used the Trident layout engine. The Macintosh Edition introduced a new rendering engine called Tasman that was designed to be more compliant with emerging W3C standards such as HTML 4.0, CSS Level 1, DOM Level 1, and ECMAScript. It also introduced a number of features that were later added to other browsers such as complete support for the PNG image standard (which previous versions did not support at all), DOCTYPE switching, Text Zoom and XML source view. It also included an Auction Manager for tracking auctions in sites like eBay and an Internet Scrapbook to allow users to quickly and easily store and organize web content (for example an image or a piece of selected text). Preview releases of the browser included a feature called the MediaBar which integrated MP3 and internet radio playback, but this feature was dropped from the final version. The initial release was just for Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, however two months after that release on May 15 a Mac OS X version was released, bundled with the Mac OS X DP4 release handed out to developers at the 2000 Worldwide Developers Conference. The Mac OS X Public Beta included another preview of the Mac OS X version of IE. The release of Mac OS X 10.0 on March 24, 2001, included yet another preview of the Mac OS X version of IE 5. This was updated later, and the release of Mac OS X v10.1 on September 25, 2001, included the final version of Internet Explorer 5.1 for Mac OS X. IE 5.1 for Mac OS 8 and 9 was released on December 18, 2001.

According to Jorg Brown, one of the IE for Mac developers at Microsoft, after version 5 most of the team that produced IE for Mac were moved to another project. IE for Mac was relegated to something they were expected to work on in their &quot;spare time&quot;.

On June 17, 2002, Microsoft announced the release of version 5.2 (the first Mac OS X-only release) which included a few performance and security fixes and support for Mac OS X features, like Quartz text smoothing.

In 2002, Microsoft reassigned developers to develop version 6 of Internet Explorer for Mac, intended to be used as the base for a new product. MSN for Mac OS X would be a subscription-only browser that worked with the online MSN service, incorporate features like an address book, junk mail filters and an MSN Messenger client. However, after hearing that Apple had started development of their own browser, they canceled the standalone browser development and concentrated on the MSN browser, which was released on May 15, 2003.

On June 13, 2003, PC Pro reported that Macintosh Business Unit general manager Roz Ho had confirmed that aside from updates to fix security problems, there would be no new versions of Internet Explorer from Microsoft. Three days later on June 16, 2003, Microsoft released the final version for Mac OS X (PPC), version 5.2.3 and a month later on July 11, 2003, they released the final version for Mac OS 8 and 9, version 5.1.7. The last versions of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X (PPC) had a distinguishing blue logo that was the base for the logo used in Internet Explorer 6 for Windows (the Windows one just had a lighter blue, and it was less three-dimensional).

====Distinguishing features====
These are features found in Internet Explorer for Mac, which were not found in common contemporary browsers (with the possible exception of Internet Explorer for Windows). Some are still not features in many browsers.

* Support for annotative glosses to Japanese kanji and Chinese characters (see furigana).
* Scrapbook feature lets the user archive any page in its current state.
* Auction Manager feature automatically tracks eBay auctions.
* Although Internet Explorer for Mac did not have any PNG support at all until version 5.0 (a year or two after other major browsers), the PNG support added in that version was unusually robust, including transparency and color correction.
* Support for matching web page colors using ColorSync.
* An option to change the browser color, to match the colors of the iMac G3. The first builds had a choice of 9 colors, but later builds had 15.
* The URL auto-complete window in the pre-Carbon versions was translucent and blurred the content behind to maintain readability of the suggested completions. This is the first time an app had a blurred translucent window and an effect similar to the look of iOS 7 years later. The later Carbon versions just used Mac OS X built-in window translucency without blurring. 
* Print Preview functionality allowing for adjustment of the font-size from within the preview pane.
* Page Holder sidebar functionality allowing users to hold a rendered page in the sidebar (a links-only view was available too) and load clicked links in the main browser window. Much of this functionality was replaced with tabbed browsing in later browsers, but not the links-only view.
* As with previous IE Mac versions, and in common with many other Macintosh internet software, the URL from which content was downloaded is added to the Finder&#x27;s Comment field (visible through Get Info).
* Support for the Internet Config system. Macintosh versions of Internet Explorer were characterized by strong support for Macintosh-only technologies, generally to a greater degree than Netscape Navigator.

====Other features ====
These are features found in Internet Explorer for Mac and some other of its contemporaries.

* Auto-complete in the address bar responds to typing partial URLs or page titles, searches favorites and history
* Go menu allows access to the persistent global browser history
* Tasman rendering engine offers superior CSS support compared to Trident in other Internet Explorer 5 versions, and was not affected by the Internet Explorer box model bug (not fixed in Trident until IE 6)
* Text zoom allows the user to resize text on any page, regardless of how text size is specified

====Easter egg====
Acid1 is included as an offline Easter egg, accessible by typing &#x27;tasman&#x27;, in Internet Explorer 5 for Mac OS with the text replaced by the names of the developers.

<text>Copenhagen Zoo () is a zoological garden in Copenhagen, Denmark. Founded in 1859, it is one of the oldest zoos in Europe and is a member of EAZA. It comprises and is located in the municipality of Frederiksberg, sandwiched between the parks of Frederiksberg Gardens and Søndermarken. With 1,571,331 visitors in 2019 it is the most visited zoo and one of the most visited attractions in Denmark. The zoo is noted for its new Elephant House designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster. The zoo maintains and promotes a number of European breeding programmes.

==History==

Copenhagen Zoo was founded by the ornithologist Niels Kjærbølling in 1859. He was given the summer garden of &quot;Prinsess Vilhelmines Have&quot; (The garden of Princess Vilhelmine) by the chief directorate of Copenhagen. The animals that the visitors could contemplate at the opening were eagles, chickens, ducks, owls, rabbits, a fox, a seal in a bathtub and a turtle in a bucket. In the early years the zoo focused on showing as many different types of animals as possible, but as animal welfare later became an issue, the number of different species has dropped in favour of more space to each animal. In 1901 the zoo had a human display with 25 Indians- men, women and children- in an exhibition where the &quot;brown exotic&quot; people went about their daily lives in palm tree leaf huts constructed in the middle of the zoo.
One of the most notable animals kept there was a male slow worm that lived there from 1892 to 1946 (for 54 years, which is a record among lizards).

Starting in the early 1980s, Copenhagen Zoo has been undergoing a renovations aimed at replacing cages with enclosures which recreate animals&#x27; natural environments, giving a better lifestyle to the animals, and a more realistic experience to visitors. The Elephant House and Savanna are results of these efforts. The Savanna includes a Hippopotamus House where the hippos can be watched underwater.

The zoo has preserved many of its historical buildings. The oldest building still in use, a stable for yaks, was erected in 1872, and now houses the bactrian camels. A Herbivore House built in 1875 still houses herbivores, namely tapirs. An owl tower from 1885 is today left as a memorial commemorating how zoo animals were once kept.
A notable and highly visible feature of the zoo is the wooden observation tower. high, it offers views of the surrounding parklands and city. The tower was built in 1905 and is one of the tallest observation towers built of wood in the world. Its base is similar to that of Eiffel Tower.

==Exhibits==
Animals exhibited at the zoo that are not housed in any of the main areas include bactrian camels, American flamingos, scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, Dalmatian pelicans, turkey vultures, Humboldt penguins, California sea lions, black-capped squirrel monkeys, chimpanzees and lions.

===The Nordics and the Arctic Ring===
In the part of the zoo called &quot;The Nordics&quot; (), visitors can see species such as harbour seals, snowy owls, reindeer, musk oxen, brown bears, arctic foxes and grey wolves. The &quot;Arctic Ring&quot; (), which opened in 2013, has an exhibit for polar bears (including a tunnel allowing underwater views) and an aviary for North Atlantic seabirds (alcids).

===Asia===
In the &quot;Asia&quot; () section, visitors can see Oriental small-clawed otters, red pandas, Malayan tapirs, Amur leopards and tigers, Asian elephants, and other animals.

The new Elephant House, which opened in June 2008, is designed by Norman Foster in cooperation with the Danish landscape architect Stig L. Andersson. It houses Asian elephants, and contains two glass-domed enclosures. One is for cows and calves and measures . The other is and is for bulls, kept in separate pens during the mating season for fear of fights. The building also contain an exhibit space and a small lecture hall. The enclosures open out through mighty rusted steel doors into am almost 1 hectare big landscaped paddock with a pool deep and long.

The paddock&#x27;s border with Frederiksberg Gardens, once a high wall, has been opened up so that people in the park can watch the elephants.

===Africa===
Most of the &quot;Africa&quot; () section is taken up by the &quot;Savanna&quot; () area. This is an open field with a visitor bridge above containing species such as white rhinoceroses, giraffes, impalas, sable antelopes, ostriches and plains zebras. The hippopotamuses, which have their own separate enclosure, also have partial access to the Savanna. Other species in the Africa section are okapis, Abyssinian ground hornbills, Congo peafowl, caracals and meerkats.

===Tasmania===
The &quot;Tasmania&quot; () section is unique to Copenhagen Zoo. The section was started after the wedding of Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark and the Tasmanian native Mary Donaldson in 2004, where the Tasmanian government gifted four Tasmanian Devils to the zoo. These were the first Tasmanian devils to live outside of Australia. The area has since been expanded with a combined area for red-necked wallabies, Eastern Grey Kangaroos and common wombats. Parts of this area is also accessible by visitors, allowing kangaroos and people to cross paths.

===South America===
In the &quot;South America&quot; () section, visitors can see species such as capybaras, guanacos, greater rheas, Patagonian maras, southern screamers and giant anteaters. They all have access to one common area, modeled after the South American pampas.

===Tropical Zoo===
The &quot;Tropical Zoo&quot; () consists of a rainforest hall with one section for free-ranging birds, turtles and two-toed sloths and another for tropical butterflies and West African crocodiles. In between the two is a section for reptiles, amphibians, fish and the rare Java mouse-deer.

===Children&#x27;s Zoo===
In the Children&#x27;s Zoo (), visitors can see farm animals and small domestic animals, such as llamas, goats, cows, pigs, horses, chickens and rabbits.

==Rare species==
* For several years, Copenhagen Zoo was the only zoo outside Australia that had Tasmanian devils, They bred for the first time in Copenhagen Zoo in 2013 and the two females gave birth to a total of seven young.
* Other rare species and subspecies kept in the zoo include: Schmitz&#x27;s Caracals, Cape Weavers, Black-necked Weavers, East African Chimpanzee, Yellow-headed Amazon, Pink-tongued Skink, Tasmanian Wombat, Tasmanian Eastern Grey Kangaroo, Banded Razorbill and West African crocodile; all of which are rarely kept species in European zoos.
* Copenhagen Zoo has the rare Amur leopard, okapi, and muskox.
* In April 2019 Copenhagen Zoo received two giant panda on loan from China.

== Culling controversy ==

A healthy young male giraffe, Marius, was killed on 9 February 2014 on the recommendation of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria. His meat was fed to the zoo&#x27;s lions, while other parts were transferred to a scientific institution. The scientific director at Copenhagen Zoo, Bengt Holst defended the culling, saying that the giraffes at the zoo bred very well, and where this was the case, giraffes had to be killed to ensure the best genes were passed down to ensure the animals&#x27; long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year. The death occurred despite offers from other animal institutions (EAZA member Yorkshire Wildlife Park (YWP) in the United Kingdom and Hoenderdael Park in The Netherlands) to take the giraffe.

YWP released a statement that it had the capacity to accept a further giraffe into its bachelor herd in its state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012, and that contact had been made with Copenhagen Zoo but no reply had been received. YWP has previously received a male giraffe of the same age as Marius from Copenhagen Zoo. Bengt Holst stated that the capacity at YWP would be better utilised by a giraffe whose genes were less represented amongst EAZA zoos.

The action was criticized by Stine Jensen from Denmark&#x27;s Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals, who repudiated the action as unethical. She said, &quot;This situation should not have occurred at all. It just shows that the zoo is in fact not the ethical institution that it wants to portray itself as being, because here you have a waste product - that being Marius. Here we have a zoo which thinks that putting this giraffe down instead of thinking of alternatives is the best option&quot;.

Images of the carcass being cut up in front of children and then fed to the zoo&#x27;s lion population were circulated by the Associated Press. The zoo spokesperson, Tobias Stenbaek Bro, has been quoted as saying that visitors, including children, were invited to watch as the giraffe was skinned and parts fed to the lions. &quot;I&#x27;m actually proud because I think we have given children a huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe that they wouldn&#x27;t have had from watching a giraffe in a photo,&quot; Stenbaek Bro said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press.

On 25 March 2014, despite the backlash from the giraffe cull, the zoo euthanized four lions (two adults and two ten-month-old cubs). The zoo stated that they were introducing a male lion and did not want to disrupt the pride&#x27;s natural structure and behaviour. The lions were not culled or dissected in public.

==Cultural references==
Copenhagen Zoo is used as location in the films &quot;Københavnere&quot; (1933), &quot;Wienerbarnet&quot; (1941), &quot;Hold fingrene fra mor&quot; (1951), &quot;Far til fire på landet&quot; (1955), &quot;Vi er allesammen tossede&quot; (1959), &quot;Rikki og mændene&quot; (1962), &quot;Den store badedag&quot; (1991), &quot;Jungledyret Hugo&quot; (1993), and &quot;Far til fire på japansk&quot; (2010).

The zoo is also used as location in episode 84 of the DR television show &quot;Huset på Christianshavn&quot; and in the TV2 television Christmas calendar &quot;Brødrenes Mortensens jul&quot;.

<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) class I1s steam locomotives were the largest class of 2-10-0 &quot;Decapods&quot; in the United States. From 1916 to 1923, 598 locomotives were produced (123 at Altoona Works and 475 at Baldwin Locomotive Works). They were the dominant freight locomotive on the system until World War II and remained in service until 1957. Nicknames for the type included Decs and Hippos, the latter due to their large boiler.

The I1s design was much larger than the 2-10-0 design that preceded it, taking advantage of the PRR&#x27;s heavy trackage and high allowed axle load, with a wide, free-steaming boiler. Large cylinders enabled the I1s to apply that power to the rails. However, the large boiler limited the size of the driving wheels, which made it impossible to mount counterweights large enough to balance the piston thrusts. As a result, they were hard riding at anything but low speeds, prone to slipping, and unpopular with crews. The locomotives were known for being very powerful, with one author describing them as &quot;the holy terror of the PRR&quot;.

Subclass I1sa increased maximum steam cut-off to admit steam for 78% of the piston stroke (rather than the original 50%), boosting low speed tractive effort from . There was no obvious external difference, except for a revised builders&#x27; plate and combination lever. The I1s locomotives were converted to I1sa during major overhauls; eventually, 489 were converted while 109 remained as-built.

== Preservation ==
Of the 598 class I1 locomotives built for the Pennsylvania Railroad, only one (#4483) survived the scrapper&#x27;s torch. PRR 4483 was built in May 1923 and assigned to drag freight service. In February 1931, it was converted to an I1sa, increasing its tractive effort, and assigned to the Eastern Region, Susquehanna Division and Northern Region. On 1 November 1944, PRR 4483 was reassigned to the Eastern Region, Central PA Division and Williamsport Division and equipped with a cab signal, whistle and acknowledger. In the early 1950s, it was again reassigned to the PRR Ebenezer, often seen hauling coal drags up the Elmira Branch to the coal unloading docks in Sodus Bay on Lake Ontario, New York.

On 7 August 1957, 4483 was retired. In 1959, PRR 4483 was moved to the roundhouse in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. In 1963, the engine was purchased by the Westinghouse Air Brake Company to display on the front lawn of their headquarters in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. The company had sought a railroad-themed display for its headquarters to commemorate its heritage of supplying air brakes to America&#x27;s railroads. The locomotive saw little maintenance during this period and its condition deteriorated significantly, although the boiler&#x27;s asbestos cladding was removed. By 1982, after the company grew tired of the locomotive on its front lawn, the Western New York Railway Historical Society acquired PRR 4483 and moved it to Hamburg, New York, where it now resides. Currently, the organization hopes to move the locomotive to the Heritage Discovery Center in Buffalo, New York to sit on public display.

== Accidents and Incidents ==

* On July 31, 1940, two I1sa 2-10-0s were travelling with 74 freight cars from Columbus to Cleveland departed Arlington in Akron heading north when they collided with a Pennsylvania Railroad class GEW275 Doodlebug No. 4648, Both I1sa 2-10-0s were repaired after the accident but would be scrapped when the PRR dieselized.

<doc id="1144352" wikidata="Q883486" url="?curid=1144352" title="William A. MacCorkle">
<text>William Alexander MacCorkle (May 7, 1857 – September 24, 1930), was an American teacher, lawyer, prosecutor, the ninth governor of West Virginia and state legislator of West Virginia, and financier. His residence in Charleston, known as Sunrise, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Biography==

He was born near Lexington, Virginia. After briefly teaching school in Pocahontas County, West Virginia, he attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. Returning to West Virginia, in 1879, he established a law practice in Charleston and also taught school. From 1880 to 1889, he served as the Kanawha County prosecuting attorney. In 1884 he married Belle Goshorn. MacCorkle possessed strong views regarding the Confederacy. On December 8, 1889, he struck U.S. Marshal W.J. White at the Ruffner Hotel in Charleston after the latter made a disparaging comment about former Confederate president Jefferson Davis.

In 1892, as the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate, he was elected governor of West Virginia. As governor, MacCorkle advocated increased funding for state institutions and improved transportation. Through an advertising program, he actively promoted the state&#x27;s natural resources to attract industry. MacCorkle opposed the growing labor movement among coal miners and dispatched the state militia to break a strike.

MacCorkle addressed the Southern Conference On Race Problems in Montgomery, Alabama, on May 9, 1900. The address was entitled &quot;The Negro and the Intelligence and Property Franchise.&quot; This address passionately set forth his opinions advocating for rights for African Americans.

After leaving office, MacCorkle returned to his Charleston law practice. In his numerous travels, he continued to publicize the state&#x27;s resources. In 1910, he was elected to the West Virginia Senate. MacCorkle was also a founder and president of the Citizens National Bank, which later merged with the Charleston National Bank. He wrote an autobiography, &quot;The Recollections of Fifty Years&quot;, which was published in 1928. He died at his Charleston home, Sunrise, in 1930.

==Legacy==

MacCorkle&#x27;s mansion, Sunrise, became home to a children&#x27;s museum in the early 1960s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The children&#x27;s museum (now called Avampato Discovery Museum) was relocated to The Clay Center about two miles away in downtown Charleston in 2003. The Sunrise estate currently houses the law firm of Farmer Cline &amp; Campbell PLLC.

In Charleston, a major arterial road, MacCorkle Avenue, was named for him and carries U.S. Route 60 through the area. His papers form a valuable research resource at the West Virginia Division of Culture and History, which maintains the MacCorkle Collection on their State History and Archives website.

<doc id="1144353" wikidata="Q4162186" url="?curid=1144353" title="Rancho Park, Los Angeles">
<text>Rancho Park is a residential neighborhood in the Westside of the city of Los Angeles, California with mostly single family homes and tree lined streets. The community is nestled between West Los Angeles and Cheviot Hills. This enclave draws young professionals and families and is home to residents working in a variety of professional occupations. History proves the neighborhood was once a part of Westwood until Olympic Blvd. was placed dividing the area North and South. The Southern section, now known as Rancho Park, felt cut off from its North side lobbying for its own identity in the 1930s.

==Etymology==
Rancho Park was named by area boosters after World War II.
 We thought it was about time to have our own community. We must separate ourselves from Westwood. There were many names suggested for our new community but there was a pioneer real estate broker here who had established his office on Pico near Manning back in 1927. His name was Bill Heyler. Bill did as much as any other one person to develop the area; so when it came time to adopting a name for the community, the wisdom of our pioneer was in counsel. The honor of naming this community &quot;Rancho Park&quot; went to Bill Heyler. Heyler is also credited with bringing in the Rancho Park Golf Course, which opened in 1947.

==Geography==
It is bordered by Sawtelle on the west, West Los Angeles on the northwest, Cheviot Hills on the east, and Westside Village on the south. The district&#x27;s boundaries, while somewhat ill-defined, are generally considered to be the San Diego Freeway (I-405) or Sepulveda on the west, Olympic Boulevard on the north, Manning Avenue (south of Pico Boulevard) and Beverly Glen Boulevard (north of Pico) on the east, and National Boulevard on the south. (Los Angeles City signs mark Olympic Boulevard as the district&#x27;s northern boundary.) Major thoroughfares include Pico, Westwood, Olympic, Sepulveda, and Beverly Glen Boulevards, along with Overland and Manning Avenues. Nearby is Santa Monica Boulevard. Century City is also located nearby.

==History==
Rancho Park was developed in the 1920s as a middle-class area, and most of its housing stock consists of Spanish Colonial bungalows and ranch houses. Today, many of the modest sized homes have been rehabbed into larger and more modern architecture. Apart from the heavily traveled stretch of Pico Boulevard (including the Westside Pavilion shopping mall) in its central portions, the district has a notably quiet, suburban feel. The district&#x27;s streets are equipped with faux 19th-century streetlights and feature large deciduous trees in the strips between the sidewalk and the street. (Rancho Park is one of the few districts in Los Angeles where fall foliage can be seen.) The enclave is centrally located to other Westside communities.

==Demographics==
In 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Mapping L.A.&quot; project supplied these Rancho Park neighborhood statistics: population: 5,464; median household income: $78,116.

==Government==
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Rancho Park. Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station serving the neighborhood.

==Education==
Rancho Park is served by Los Angeles USD schools:

* Westwood Charter Elementary School
* Overland Elementary School
* Clover Elementary School
* Emerson Middle School
* Venice High School
* Hamilton High School
Private school:
* Notre Dame Academy (Catholic girls high school)
* Lycee Francais de Los Angeles (private, bilingual and international institution)
* St Timothy School (Catholic school)
* Redeemer Baptist Elementary School
Charter school:
* New West Charter Middle School

Los Angeles Public Library operates the Palms–Rancho Park Branch.

==Recreation==
The municipal Rancho Park Golf Course includes an 18-hole layout par 71 championship course. The park has Back Nine Play, a banquet room, a cart rental, a clubhouse, a lighted driving range, lessons, locker rooms for men and women, practice putting greens, a pro shop, rental clubs, and a snack bar. Two people have tied the course record of 61 (–10) at the par-71 course. The junior record is 64 (–7) by Tiger Woods in 1989, at the age of 13. The senior record is held by James White, who shot a 65 (–6) in the Los Angeles Senior City Championship in August 1998.

<text>Harpagophytum ( ), also called grapple plant, wood spider, and most commonly devil&#x27;s claw, is a genus of plants in the sesame family, native to southern Africa. Plants of the genus owe their common name &quot;devil&#x27;s claw&quot; to the peculiar appearance of their hooked fruit. Several species of North American plants in the genus &quot;Proboscidea&quot; and certain species of &quot;Pisonia&quot;, however, are also known by this name. Devil&#x27;s claw&#x27;s tuberous roots are used in folk medicine to reduce pain.

==Range==
&quot;Harpagophytum procumbens&quot; is mainly found in the eastern and south eastern parts of Namibia, Southern Botswana, and the Kalahari region of the Northern Cape, South Africa. &quot;H. zeyheri&quot; is found in the northern parts of Namibia (Ovamboland) and southern Angola.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Harpagophytum&quot;, is derived from the Greek words &quot;harpago&quot; meaning &quot;hook&quot; and &quot;phyton&quot; meaning &quot;plant&quot;.

== Folk medicine and research==
The ethnobotanical use of devil&#x27;s claw originated in southern Africa. &quot;H. procumbens&quot; is one of the floral emblems of Botswana where it is thought to be useful in treating a variety of pain conditions.

Preparations of the plant or its extracts, such as harpagoside, are presumed to have uses in folk medicine and phytotherapy as an anti-inflammatory herbal drug or dietary supplement. Although there is no accepted clinical evidence of its efficacy and bioavailability, limited effects were noted for treating lower back pain and osteoarthritis.

A 2016 Cochrane review of clinical research noted that devil&#x27;s claw seems to reduce low back pain more than placebo, although evidence was of moderate quality at best. Further research in effects upon pain and inflammation have been found worth pursuing through 2022.

== Adverse reactions ==
Caution exists for a variety of conditions, such as pregnancy and cardiovascular disorders. Devil&#x27;s claw may cause diarrhea and may interfere with the action of ticlopidine and warfarin.

== Ecology and management ==
&quot;Harpagophytum procumbens&quot; inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). It is a perennial, tuberous plant with annually produced creeping stems. The above-ground stems emerge after the first rains and die back during droughts or after frosts. The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. Seeds have a high degree of dormancy. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years.

The sustainability of the trade in devil&#x27;s claw has been questioned for several years. The governments of each of the countries in which it occurs (range states; Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa) have developed policies and regulations to protect the species, to determine a sustainable harvest, and to provide for continued livelihoods for the harvesters. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However, the range states have implemented measures to manage the trade sustainably and the proposal to protect the species by CITES was withdrawn.

Various studies have examined the biological and ecological requirements of harvested and unharvested populations. Several early short-term studies in Botswana examined the ecological requirements of the species. Other, somewhat more recent studies inventoried the resource and examined sustainable harvesting methods.

The ecological requirements of a harvested species must be known to manage the harvest of the species to ensure it is sustainable. Stewart and Cole (2005) examined the complex economic, social, and cultural factors involved in the harvest of the species. Stewart (2009) examined population structure, density, growth, mortality, and seed and fruit production in harvested and unharvested populations in the Kalahari savannas of South Africa. Plant density and population structure differed significantly between overgrazed and grass-dominated areas, suggesting that the differences may be due to competition for scarce water and nutrients. Experimental removal of secondary tubers (harvest) was not a significant factor for mortality in any of the harvested size classes. Harvest also did not affect growth, although plants in the medium size class grew more during the study period in both the harvested and unharvested populations. Fruit production was highly variable, and mature fruits were produced only under favorable conditions. Under the conditions of this experimental harvest, the species appears to be resilient to harvest, with plants subjected to harvest surviving as well as unharvested plants. However, due to the spatially variable nature of its habitat and the plasticity of the plants themselves, harvesting data from actual harvested areas from a large number of plants is required to better understand the life history of the species.

<text>Philippos Syrigos (; 1948 – 13 October 2013) was a Greek investigative journalist and sports reporter who investigated doping cases in Greece. He was assaulted by masked men on 18 October 2004 in Athens but recovered.

Syrigos worked for a Greek daily newspaper &quot;Eleftherotypia&quot;. During the 2004 Olympics, he reported on the doping scandal of Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou. He later claimed that he was aware of the alleged accident two hours before it happened. He has also written about hooliganism, the Paranga scandal, debts incurred by some of the Greek football clubs and other dealings connected to 2004 Olympics in Athens.

On 18 October 2004, when Syrigos was leaving the studios of radio &quot;Sport FM&quot; in Kallithea, Athens, three men attacked him, stabbed him and hit him with iron bars. Syrigos was rushed to hospital where he was operated and released for home care on 23 October. His attackers have never been traced.

Syrigos, aged 65, died of cancer on 13 October 2013.

<doc id="1144365" wikidata="Q437091" url="?curid=1144365" title="Lucie Aubrac">
<text>Lucie Samuel (29 June 1912 – 14 March 2007), born Bernard and known as Lucie Aubrac (), was a member of the French Resistance in World War II. A history teacher by occupation, she earned a history &quot;agrégation&quot; in 1938, a highly uncommon achievement for a woman at that time. In 1939 she married Raymond Samuel, who took the name Aubrac in the Resistance. She was active on a number of operations, including prison breakouts. Like her husband, she was a communist militant, which she remained after the war. She sat in the Provisional Consultative Assembly in Paris from 1944 to 1945.

Her life was depicted in the 1997 film &quot;Lucie Aubrac&quot; by Claude Berri. The Paris Métro station Bagneux–Lucie Aubrac was named after her.

== Career ==
In 1940, Lucie was amongst the first to join the French Resistance. In Clermont-Ferrand, Emmanuel d&#x27;Astier de La Vigerie formed the Resistance group &quot;La Dernière Colonne&quot;, later known as Libération-sud, with her husband and Jean Cavaillès. During 1941, the group carried out two sabotage attacks at train stations in Perpignan and Cannes. In February, they organised the distribution of 10,000 propaganda flyers, but one of the distributors was caught by the police, leading to the arrest of d&#x27;Astier&#x27;s niece and uncle. At this time, Lucie gave birth to her first child. The group decided to hide, and, after a few months&#x27; hiatus, began to work on an underground newspaper, &quot;Libération&quot;. The first edition was put together with the help of the typographers from a local newspaper and printed on paper supplied by local trade-unionists; 10,000 copies were produced in July 1941.

In March 1943, Raymond was arrested. He was released in May, after Lucie intervened with the local Vichy public prosecutor, telling him they were members of the Résistance and he had 24 hours to release Raymond or be killed, and the couple then organized the clever escape of three other members of their group. A month later, Raymond was arrested again. Lucie went to see Klaus Barbie, the notorious Gestapo chief in Vichy France and claimed to be Raymond&#x27;s fiancée, saying he was named &quot;Ermelin&quot; (one of his aliases) and had been caught in a raid while innocently visiting a doctor. She was told Raymond was to be executed for being a member of the Resistance, but she was able to get permission to marry him first, supposedly to save her honor and legitimize the child with which she really was pregnant. When Raymond was being brought back to prison after &quot;wedding&quot;, he and fifteen other prisoners were rescued by a commando unit led by Lucie, who attacked the vehicle he was in, killing the six guards.
In 1944, Charles de Gaulle established a consultative assembly, which Lucie joined as a resistance representative, making her the first woman to sit on a French parliamentary assembly. In 1945, she published the first short history of the French Resistance. In 1946, she and Raymond hosted Ho Chi Minh at their home when he went to France on what turned out to be an unsuccessful mission to win independence for the then-French colony of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh and Raymond became friends.

In 1984, Lucie published a semi-fictional version of her wartime diaries, the English translation of which is known as &quot;Outwitting the Gestapo&quot;. She was inspired to publish her own writing on the war by Klaus Barbie&#x27;s claim that her husband Raymond had become an informer and betrayed Jean Moulin after his arrest. In 1985, she sat on the &quot;Jury of Honor&quot; to assess whether the documentary &quot;Des terroristes à la retraite&quot; should be aired. Aubrac hated the film, which she called &quot;misery loving&quot;, complaining it dwelled on all that was ugly in France. The 1992 film &quot;&quot; was about her and Raymond&#x27;s life during the French Resistance.

In 1996, Lucie was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government for her heroism during World War II. The 1997 film &quot;Lucie Aubrac&quot;, which stars Carole Bouquet as Lucie, is about her efforts to rescue her husband. She herself endorsed the film.

In April 1997, Jacques Vergès produced the &quot;Barbie testament&quot;, which he claimed Klaus Barbie had given him ten years earlier, that purported to show the Aubracs had tipped off Barbie regarding Moulin. Vergès&#x27; &quot;Barbie testament&quot; was timed for the publication of the book &quot;Aubrac Lyon 1943&quot; by Gérard Chauvy, which was meant to prove the Aubracs were the ones who informed Barbie about the fateful meeting at Caluire where Moulin was arrested in 1943. On 2 April 1998, following a civil suit launched by the Aubracs, a Paris court fined Chauvy and his publisher Albin Michel for &quot;public defamation&quot;. In 1998, the French historian Jacques Baynac, in his book &quot;Les Secrets de l&#x27;affaire Jean Moulin&quot;, claimed Moulin was planning to break with de Gaulle to recognize General Giraud, which led the Gaullists to tip off Barbie before this could happen. Twenty leading resistance survivors published a letter protesting against the accusations against the Aubracs, who asked to appear before a panel of leading French historians. The Aubracs did appear in a discussion with historians, organized by the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;. While none of the historians involved believed that Raymond was an informer, they did note inconsistencies in Lucie&#x27;s account of his case.
Patrick Marnham&#x27;s biography of Moulin, &quot;The Death of Jean Moulin: Biography of a Ghost&quot; (2001) suggests Raymond and possibly Lucie betrayed Moulin. In his book &quot;Resistance and Betrayal: The Death and Life of the Greatest Hero of the French Resistance (2002)&quot;, Marnham suggested that, because Raymond&#x27;s overriding allegiance was to Communism, he would not have considered himself a traitor if he had betrayed Moulin, claiming that French Communists such as the Aubracs at times gave non-Communists, such as Moulin, to the Gestapo.

Lucie had three children with Raymond. Charles de Gaulle was godfather to their second child, Catherine and Ho Chi Minh was godfather to their third child, Elizabeth.

President Nicolas Sarkozy, in a statement after Raymond&#x27;s death in 2012, said that Raymond&#x27;s escape from the Nazis led by Lucie in 1943 had &quot;become a legend in the history of the Resistance&quot;, and praised him and all Resistance members as &quot;heroes of the shadows who saved France&#x27;s honor, at a time when it seemed lost&quot;. Serge Klarsfeld, the president of the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France, said to BFM-TV that Raymond and Lucie &quot;were a legendary couple&quot; and &quot;exceptional people&quot;. François Hollande said in a statement: &quot;In our darkest times, [Raymond] was, with Lucie Aubrac, among the righteous, who found, in themselves and in the universal values of our Republic, the strength to resist Nazi barbarism&quot;. Lucie&#x27;s ashes are beside Raymond&#x27;s in the family tomb in the cemetery in the Burgundian village of Salornay-sur-Guye.

<text>Thomson Local is a local business telephone directory, published up until 2016 in the United Kingdom by Thomson Directories Ltd from its former head office at Thomson House in Farnborough, Hampshire. 

It is the principal rival (and for the 1980s and some of the 1990s the sole rival) to the Yellow Pages (published by Thomson as the Thomson Yellow Pages until it was sold to the privatised BT).

The printed directory was distributed without charge to households and businesses, reaching some 22 million homes and businesses at its peak. 

As of 2016 the company ceased the production and delivery of printed directories, opting instead to offer their services digitally. 

Thomson Local is a focused local area directory which has continually innovated with features such as colour and knock-out white advertisements. It was the first such directory in the UK to contain added value features such as local maps, local guides, and additional useful information beyond the actual business listings themselves.

Thomson Directories Ltd was originally formed to publish the Thomson Local in 1980 by The Thomson Corporation (after it had sold its Thomson Yellow Pages business) and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, in partnership. After trials in several areas, the Thomson Local was first published throughout Great Britain in 1981. It was owned by Seat Pagine Gialle S.p.A. of Italy until both companies fell into administration in August 2013. Thomson Local&#x27;s assets were purchased by telephone data company Corporate Media Partners, preserving more than 300 jobs but with 170 redundancies.

In the 1990s, the company expanded its operations to include its own online directory in the shape of thomsonlocal.com and a range of partner implementations supplying classified and keyword based listings to companies such as MSN, StreetMap, Pipex and many others.

In July 2010, Thomson Local signed a multi-year agreement to become the UK&#x27;s first re-seller of adCenter, the pay-per-click platform for Microsoft&#x27;s search engine Bing. Later that year, the company launched the thomsonlocal.com app for iPhone which has since been discontinued. 

As of 2017 Thomson Local operates from their new head office in the Templer building of Farnborough Business Park overlooking Farnborough Airport.

<text>The ranks and insignia of the &quot;[[Ordnungspolizei]]&quot; were developed in 1936 after the nationalisation of Germany&#x27;s regular police forces.

==&quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;==

&quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo) ranks were based on local police titles and were considered a separate system from the ranks of the SS. If a member of the Order Police was already an SS member or - upon application - became an SS member, he was automatically awarded an SS rank according to his police rank. Within the police administration, only the police rank was used. In the SS environment, the equivalent SS title was usually mentioned first, even if the bearer usually had no function in the SS administration. In 1944, all Orpo generals also gained equivalent &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; ranks so that, in the event of capture by the Allies, the Orpo general would hold status as a military officer instead of a police official.

It was not until the decree of 16.4.1940 that the Order Police were allowed to show their SS affiliation in their uniforms: A small SS rune was sewn on below the left breast pocket.

==&quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; rank insignia==
In addition to collar and shoulder insignia, &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; also wore the wreathed police eagle on the upper left sleeve. The collar patch and shoulderboards were backed, and the sleeve eagle (below the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot;) embroidered, in &quot;truppenfarbe&quot;, a colour-code which indicated the branch of police: green for &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; (protection police) and police general officers, wine-red for &quot;Gemeindepolizei&quot; (municipal protection police), orange for rural &quot;Gendarmerie,&quot; carmine-red for fire brigades, gold for maritime police, and light grey for administrative police.

===General officers===

&quot;Note: Since most police generals, increasingly as time went on, were also SS generals, they typically wore an SS uniform except at police-specific functions.

===Field and junior officers===
===Enlisted, NCOs, and senior NCOs===

==Rank and pay==
Mean annual pay for an industrial worker was 1,459 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; in 1939, and for a privately employed white-collar worker 2,772 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot;.

<text>Oscar Roberto Panno (born 17 March 1935) is an Argentine chess Grandmaster. 

==Biography==
Panno was born in Buenos Aires. He won the 2nd World Junior Chess Championship in 1953, ahead of such future strong Grandmasters as Borislav Ivkov, Bent Larsen, and Fridrik Olafsson. He also won the championship of Argentina the same year. Oscar Panno became a grandmaster at the age of twenty.

He competed in five interzonal tournaments, with his greatest success coming at Gothenburg 1955. In a field of 21 players, Panno finished clear third, only half a point out of second and ahead of such players as Efim Geller, Tigran Petrosian, and Boris Spassky. (He beat future World Champion Spassky in their individual game.) This result was probably the peak of his career, as it advanced him to the 1956 Candidates tournament in Amsterdam, the winner of which would play a 24-game match for the World Championship with Mikhail Botvinnik. However, his form from the interzonal did not carry over and he finished in a tie for 8th-9th in a ten-man field.

Chessmetrics.com, which attempts to rank players from before the introduction of FIDE ratings, estimates that he was as high as 18th in the world in his prime, in late 1955. He had an Elo rating of 2585 and was 19th in the world in his second prime (1973).

Panno has several successes at the tournaments at Mar del Plata. He won the international tournaments in 1954 and 1969 (shared with Miguel Najdorf), and the open tournaments in 1986, 1988, and 1994. He twice in a row won the strong Palma de Mallorca international invitational tournament: 1971 together with Ljubomir Ljubojević, 1972 at the best tie-break along with Viktor Korchnoi and Jan Smejkal. Panno tied for first at the prestigious Lone Pine 1977.

He played various famous grandmasters. In addition to his win over Boris Spassky in 1955, he also beat him at the 1976 Manila interzonal.

Panno played eleven times for Argentina in Chess Olympiads (1954–58, 1962, 1966–70, 1976, 1986–88, 1992). The 1954 Olympiad team won the silver medal, while the 1958 and 1962 teams won the bronze medal.

He was still active as of 2008, finishing third in the Bobby Fischer Memorial tournament held in Villa Martelli.

<doc id="1144381" wikidata="Q50429" url="?curid=1144381" title="Yongsan District">
<text>Yongsan District (, ) is one of the 25 districts of Seoul, South Korea. It has a population of 231,685 (2020) and has a geographic area of , and is divided into 19 &quot;dong&quot; (administrative neighborhoods). Yongsan is located near Downtown Seoul, on the northern bank of the Han River, bordering the city districts of Jung to the north, Mapo to the west, Yeongdeungpo and Dongjak to the southwest, Seocho and Gangnam District to the southeast, and Seongdong to the east.

==Description==
Yongsan District is a district in central Seoul, South Korea. It sits to the north of the Han River and is part of the &quot;Seongjeosimni&quot; (Outer old Seoul) area immediately south of Seoul&#x27;s historic center in Jung district on the southern side of Namsan. It is home to roughly 250,000 people and is divided into 20 dong, or neighborhoods. Notable locations in Yongsan District include Yongsan Station, the sprawling Yongsan Electronics Market, Haebangchon and the Itaewon commercial district. Itaewon is widely known as one of the most ethnically diverse regions in Korea. Many foreigners gravitate to its shopping centers and nightlife.

It is the site of Yongsan Garrison, a large United States military base which, as of 2021, has gradually been wound down with the US forces being moved to Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek.

==Geography==
Yongsan is located next to the Han River, with level ground in the west of the district which has been used for transportation (rail) and commercial use since the early 20th century. To the east and north in the land is steeper and rises towards Namsan which lies to the north. Namsan has an elevation of 243m and consists mostly of granite. The low lying western section of the district is approximately 15-20 above sea level. This low-lying area has been prone to flooding during periods of heavy rainfall, a common issue with most of the low lying riverside districts in the city.

==Etymology==
The name Yongsan derives from hanja and means &quot;Dragon Mountain&quot;. In hanja, the characters are 龍 yong (meaning &quot;dragon&quot;) and 山 san (meaning &quot;mountain&quot;).

==History==
The oldest recorded mention of Yongsan is in a fable about two dragons that appeared over the Han River in the 21st year of King Giru&#x27;s reign during the Baekje Dynasty. Some also say that the name &quot;Yongsan&quot; (which means &quot;dragon mountain&quot; in Korean) comes from the shape of the area&#x27;s mountains, which resemble that of a dragon.

During the Joseon period, Yongsan served as an entry point to the city of Seoul for seaborne travelers and merchants, with a small port facility in operation by the Han River. As such, the area became known for commerce and is considered the first example of capitalism taking place in Korea. Given its commercial importance and growing size, it effectively became Korea&#x27;s first satellite city as it sat a short distance outside the old city walls of Seoul.

Yongsan was designated an &quot;open district&quot; by the Korean government in 1884 and subsequently a foreign community established itself in the area, consisting of French, Chinese and Japanese missionaries. Permission was given for missionary work to commence in 1887.

Yongsan District, as an administrative district, came into being on April 17, 1896, under the name &quot;Yongsan-bang&quot;. In October 1945 it became &quot;Yongsan-gu&quot; and in 1946 &quot;Yongsan District of Seoul.&quot; The smaller administrative units, &quot;dongs&quot;, were introduced in 1955.

==Administration==
===Administrative divisions===

Yongsan is divided into the following areas (&#x27;dongs&#x27;), each of which is served by a community center ().

===Local government===

The Yongsan district office is located close to Noksapyeong Station on Noksapyeong-daero. The district office provides services to Koreans and foreign residents in Korea, including issuing documentation, taxes, public safety and medical services. It is also responsible for maintaining leisure facilities in the district including: Yongsan Sports Center, Ichon Hangang Riverside Park, Namsan, Hyochang Park &amp; Yongsan Family Park.

==Demographics==

Since the establishment of a foreign community in Yongsan in the late 19th century, the area has been known as the most multicultural district in the city. This moniker was due in no small part to the presence of the Yongsan Garrison. However, other establishments such as the Seoul Central Mosque have had a huge effect on the culture and demographic nature of the district. According to statistics from the Yongsan district office, the foreign community has been increasing every year since 2015, when the total number of foreign residents was 19,078. As of 2020, it was 21,067.

== Politics and government==
The headquarters of the Korean Ministry of National Defense (MND) are located in Yongsan, in between the northern and southern sections of Yongsan Garrison, close to Samgakji station.

Currently, the official residence and executive office of the President of South Korea is in Yongsan, occupying the building formerly known as the Ministry of National Defense Building. The Presidential office and residence, as well as other related agencies, were moved from the Blue House in Jongno District in 2022, during the term of President Yoon Suk-Yeol.

==Diplomatic missions==
Being at the center of the city, the district hosts numerous foreign embassies.

==Military==
Since the 19th century the Yongsan site has been used as a military installation, first by the Chinese and then primarily by the Japanese who established their military headquarters at the site from 1910 to 1945.

Following the end of WW2, the US Army established a presence at the site which became known as the Yongsan Garrison. The large garrison, which has provided extensive services to US army personnel for over 60 years, is also the site of the US embassy housing compound. Forces and personnel assigned to Yongsan and South Korea as a whole fall under the jurisdiction of the Eighth US Army. As of 2021, most of the US personnel at the site, with the exception of embassy personnel, have been moved to Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, along with Eighth Army HQ, as part of a long-standing agreement between the governments of South Korea and the United States. However, given its strategic importance and its symbolic nature in reassuring South Korea of US commitment to mutual defence and security, at least one US army brigade will remain to the north of Seoul to counteract the loss of the Yongsan Garrison. In addition, a small segment of the garrison will remain under US-ownership specifically to keep the Dragon Hill Lodge open, an important piece of infrastructure catering mainly to US military, government and associated personnel visiting Korea, and to eventually relocate the US Embassy here from its current location at Gwanghwamun.

The presence of the Yongsan Garrison has had a significant effect on life in Seoul and South Korea at large, with the adjacent Itaewon area developing to serve the needs of US personnel stationed at Yongsan. The presence of US personnel, currency and supplies was of huge importance to the people of Seoul in the early years after the Korean War and a considerable black market developed, as did numerous variations of Korean staple dishes using newly arrived US food supplies.

==National Park Proposal==
The withdrawal of most US personnel and infrastructure from Yongsan will free up a significant amount of land within the district, land which has been under foreign control for over a century. The first proposal for redeveloping the site came from the former president Roh Moo-Hyun in 2005.
Since then, negotiations between South Korea and the US over transfer of the land have taken place with the issue of relocating to Pyeongtaek and contamination of the Yongsan site causing delays to the plan.
As envisaged in late 2019, the site will become an ecological park of some 3.03 million sq. meters, slightly smaller than Central Park in New York.

In January 2021 the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that the area would be called &quot;Yongsan Park&quot;. The name was chosen after a poll in which residents submitted 9,401 name proposals in 2020.

==Economy==

Yongsan has a diverse economy with major differences between areas within the district.

The area around Seoul Station and Yongsan Station is dominated by large corporations and KOSPI 200 companies based in Yongsan include Amore Pacific, Orion Confectionery, Cheil Worldwide, HYBE Corporation and Hyundai Development Company. The aforementioned AmorePacific opened their global headquarters next to Shinyongsan Station in 2017.

The Yongsan area has seen considerable development since the mid-2010s with the addition of upmarket apartment buildings are high grade office space. On the west side of Yongsan is &quot;Seoul Dragon City&quot;, a new multi-tenant hotel development which is planned as the first phase of a major redevelopment project on the site of the disused railroad marshaling yard. The development includes four hotels run by three hotel chains: Novotel, Mercure and Ibis.

Hannam-dong is an upmarket area to the east of the district and is the location of some of the most expensive real estate in Seoul, along with galleries and restaurants.

Finally, Namsan, situated to the north, is a major tourist hotspot although Namsan Tower itself is located in Jung-Gu, not Yongsan.

===Itaewon Special Tourist Zone===
The Itaewon area besides Yongsan Garrison was designated a special tourist zone in 1997 on account of popularity not only with US military personnel but also Koreans and foreign tourists and residents. According to Korean government data, 20,000 foreign residents live in the area. Itaewon&#x27;s popularity began to diversify and increase in the 1980s as international attention focused on Seoul and the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics. The area has around 2,000 shops and a large number of bars, clubs, restaurants and cafes. The focal point of the area is the intersection in front of the Hamilton Hotel, on top of Itaewon Station. From there, several different areas branch off to form distinct communities. Immediately to the north and spread towards HBC is a lively bar, club and eating area. To the south of the station are more shops and multi ethnic cuisines influenced by the presence of Seoul Central Mosque. This area has seen a large increase in the number of small shops selling clothes, jewellery and associated items, as well a large number of tailors who have historically catered for US military personnel. Every October, Itaewon Global Village Festival takes place in and around the area, with the focal point being on Itaewon-ro where live music performances are held and international food markets take place.

Close to Itaewon are Hangangjin and Hannam-dong. Both areas are known for their gentrified leisure-based economies with a large number of galleries, cafes and restaurants. Hannam-dong is also known for having the most expensive real estate prices in South Korea, with recent (2020) apartment prices reaching $6.16 million. Housing is this area is popular with corporate executives and other wealthy individuals. Galleria recently opened a new department store in Hannam-dong which is partially focused on VIP customers and luxury goods. The department store is incorporated into the &quot;Nine One Hannam&quot; apartment complex, a luxury housing development built on the site of housing previously used by US military and government personnel.

===Yongridan-gil===
Young people gathered in the alleyway of Han River-ro 2-ga between Yongsan Station and the triangular area since the establishment of AmorePacific New Building. The street, where cute cafes and restaurants remodeled nearby houses were created one by one, began to be called &quot;Yongridan-gil.&quot; Various subway lines such as Yongsan Station, Shin Yong-san Station, and Triangle Zone exist around and are emerging as a hot place for young people as they belong to the axis where transportation is convenient.

==Transport==


===Rail===
Being centrally located within Seoul, Yongsan is host to two of Seoul&#x27;s most important intercity rail stations – Seoul Station and Yongsan Station. Both stations serve KTX, ITX, Mugunghwa and tourist services connecting the district with most parts of the country. Given the fact that South Korea is effectively landlocked due to the lack of cross-border transport with North Korea, Seoul Station is the most northern and largest intercity rail station in the country, with only a handful of smaller commuter and tourism-focused stations to the north. The original Seoul Station building closed in 1988 and was replaced by the current structure which integrates the station building with a large Lotte Outlet&#x27;s complex.

Yongsan Station, like Seoul Station, is a multipurpose facility which now consists of a duty free mall, department store and cinema. With the commencement of KTX services in 2004, Yongsan Station began to share these new services with Seoul Station and this gave rise to increased investment and development at the station.

===GTX===
Great Train Express is a planned high speed commuter rail network in the Seoul Capital Area project consisting of three separate lines, named GTX A, GTX B and GTX C, with the first two intended to serve Seoul Station (A &amp; B) and Yongsan Station (B).

===AREX===
Seoul station is also served by AREX, the airport railroad. AREX began operations in 2007 and provides &#x27;all-stop&#x27; (commuter) and &#x27;express&#x27; (direct services from Incheon International Airport to Seoul Station) services. The service was extended in 2018 to serve the newly opened terminal 2 at Incheon International Airport.

===Metro===
Yongsan is served by Seoul Subway Line 1, Line 4, Line 6, and the Gyeonggi-Jungang Line. Lines 1 and 4 serve Seoul and Yongsan stations and provide inter-connectivity with intercity rail services. Meanwhile, Line 6 passes through the district on a west–east axis serving Samgajki and Itaewon and the Gyeonggi-Jungang Line serves Yongsan station and provides connections to outlying suburbs and satellite cities to the far west and east of Seoul.

===Buses===
Yongsan is served by all types of buses that operate in Seoul - green (local), blue (city), yellow (circulation buses around Namsan) and red (express). One of the largest bus stations in Yongsan is in front of Seoul Station.

===Airport Limousine===
Airport Limousine services 6030 and 6702 connect Yongsan with Gimpo and Incheon international airports. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these services have been suspended.

Sookmyung Women&#x27;s University is a private university in Yongsan. It was founded in 1906 and is considered one of the top women&#x27;s universities in South Korea.

<text>Remedy Lane is the fourth album by Swedish progressive rock band Pain of Salvation, released in January 2002. It is a concept album focusing on a character&#x27;s search for self-discovery. It was described by Allmusic as Pain of Salvation&#x27;s breakthrough album.

==Outline==
While both &quot;Remedy Lane&quot; and Pain of Salvation&#x27;s second album, &quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot;, feature a protagonist searching for self-discovery, &quot;Remedy Lane&quot; addresses a wider variety of themes, including love, loss, lust, sex and self-understanding. The album, written by guitarist and vocalist Daniel Gildenlöw, is semi-autobiographical in nature. The liner notes include poems and photos related to the concept as well as date markings to signify the chronological order of the album. Gildenlöw has said that the inspiration for &quot;Remedy Lane&quot; was an era of his life in which he wished to understand the nature of freedom.

The album&#x27;s production is similar to its predecessor, &quot;The Perfect Element, part I&quot;. While its mood is dark, there are some moments of happiness.
==Reissue==

On 1 July 2016 the band released a reissue of the album, entitled &quot;Remedy Lane Re:visited (Re:mixed &amp; Re:lived)&quot;. The 2-CD set includes a new mix of the record by longtime Pain of Salvation collaborator and mixing engineer Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios, as well as a live recording of the entire album from Pain of Salvation&#x27;s performance at the ProgPower USA Festival in 2014.

==Track listing==
All lyrics by Daniel Gildenlöw. All music by Daniel Gildenlöw, except instrumental part of &quot;Rope Ends&quot; by Daniel Gildenlöw and Fredrik Hermansson.

The Japanese edition of this album also contains a bonus track titled &quot;Thorn Clown&quot; that is sequenced between &quot;This Heart of Mine (I Pledge)&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot;. However, the Official Pain of Salvation Website shows the song as inserted between &quot;Dryad of the Woods&quot; and &quot;Remedy Lane&quot;.

<text>Craig Aloysius Montoya (born September 14, 1970) is the bassist of Castella and Tri-Polar and former bassist of Everclear.

==Early life==
Montoya was born in Spokane, Washington, the son of Daniel and Marge Montoya. He has an older brother named Dave, and an older sister named Tami; their parents later divorced.

Montoya attended Mead Senior High School, where his friends included &quot;drug-users and musicians.&quot; When he was seventeen, the local law enforcement raided his home. He was not arrested at that point, but later was for a DUI. After spending some time in jail, Montoya knew &quot;[he] didn&#x27;t want to spend the rest of [his] life behind bars.&quot; From that point on, he has rehabbed and has successfully remained clean.

==Career==
From an early age, Montoya wanted to play music. Though he was originally interested in the drums, a lack of bass guitarists in the area led him to choose the instrument. He bought his first bass guitar and amp when he was sixteen, with money he earned mowing lawns. After graduating high school, Montoya joined a band named Soul Hammer and planned a move to Portland, Oregon, but was dropped from the band once their demo tape was finished. He then looked for a bass position in &quot;The Rocket&quot;, a Northwest newspaper, and found an ad from Art Alexakis, the former lead singer of Colorfinger. Alexakis united with him and drummer Scott Cuthbert, and together they founded Everclear. The trio recorded many b-sides and performed live and local shows. In 1993, they released &quot;World of Noise&quot;, which was recorded in a friend&#x27;s basement studio.

In 1994, Everclear made several changes. Cuthbert was replaced by former Jollymon drummer Greg Eklund. The band also moved from Tim/Kerr Records to Capitol. In 1995, the new Everclear released their U.S. debut album, &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; with singles &quot;Heroin Girl,&quot; &quot;Heartspark Dollarsign,&quot; &quot;You Make Me Feel Like a Whore,&quot; and &quot;Santa Monica&quot;. The album found an audience on the alternative rock scene, as did their 1997 follow-up, &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;.

During a 1998 Australian tour, Montoya got into a heated backstage argument with Alexakis after a fan threw a lit explosive on stage, and the tour was cut short. Montoya did not join the band for the ensuing tour of the United Kingdom, with David LoPrinzi filling in.

In August 2003, after three more albums, Montoya left Everclear. In 2004, Montoya formed a new band called Tri-Polar with Sweaty Nipples members Scotty Heard on guitar and Brian Lehfeldt on drums. The band began to record in late 2004, but weeks before its self-titled release on May 27, 2005, Heard left the band for personal reasons. Looking for a replacement, Montoya turned to Kevin Hahn of Red Sector, his bandmate from The Strain. Tri-Polar is still active and plays many cities along the West Coast, including the group members&#x27; hometown of Portland.

In 2006, Montoya helped formed Castella with Hahn and frontman Ryan Andrew of Sidestar. They worked with producer Joe Chiccarelli to record &quot;How Did We Get Here&quot; during 2007. The record received praise from the critics for its songwriting and production, and several songs from the record found their way onto TV series and movie soundtracks.

Craig is also currently performing with Tacos In Hell in the Portland, OR. area. The band was founded during the pandemic in a garage. Band members include Dan Bates, Rudy Hedges, Kevin Staley, and Montoya.

<doc id="1144395" wikidata="Q2275032" url="?curid=1144395" title="USS Lizardfish">
<text>USS &quot;Lizardfish&quot; (SS-373), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a boat of the United States Navy named for the lizardfish, a slender marine fish having a scaly, lizard-like head and large mouth.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Lizardfish&quot; was laid down on 14 March 1944 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin; launched on 16 July 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Lansdale G. Sasscer; wife of Congressman Sasscer of Maryland; and commissioned on 30 December 1944.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
&quot;Lizardfish&quot; departed the Manitowoc River 20 January 1945 for Lockport, IL, where she was loaded on a floating drydock and towed down the Mississippi River. She arrived at Algiers, La., 1 February and put to sea 5 days later for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, arriving 23 March.

&quot;Lizardfish&quot; left Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol 9 April 1945. Topping off with fuel at Saipan on the 21st, she set course for the South China Sea. The submarine maintained a thorough close-in patrol of Indochina between 30 April and 18 May, but contacted no enemy traffic. From 23 to 28 May, a similar painstaking patrol in the Java Sea produced no enemy contacts. Completing this arduous patrol, &quot;Lizardfish&quot; arrived Fremantle, Australia, on 2 June.

&quot;Lizardfish&quot; got underway 28 June 1945 on her second patrol in the Java and South China Seas. Throughout this patrol, the submarine sought out targets and carried destruction to the enemy in confined harbors, straits, and anchorages. After careful submerged reconnaissance, she made two daring daylight gun attacks within range of shore batteries.

On 5 July, she entered the coral-fringed bay of Chelukan Bawang, Bali, discovering four landing barges, a 250-ton sea truck, and a 100-ton submarine chaser, all heavily camouflaged. She made a submerged run and sank &quot;Submarine Chaser Alo. 37&quot;, then battle-surfaced and opened her deck guns. Her salvos started a gasoline fire which destroyed a nest of four landing barges. She then demolished a boat shed and ripped apart the bow of a sea truck inside. Leaving this target in a flaming mass, she headed out to sea.

On 19 July near Sunda Strait, she was patrolling southward along the western shore when her crew sighted a convoy of sea trucks. The submarine surfaced and commenced firing at the closest target, started a brisk fire, and shifted targets. Meanwhile, a shore battery opened up and was lobbing shells close by. When ammunition was expended, &quot;Lizardfish&quot; submerged, leaving behind three ships burning fiercely. She surfaced that night and headed for lifeguard station off Singapore in support of Army B-24 Liberator bomber strikes. The submarine arrived Subic Bay, Philippines, on 6 August and was there when Japan capitulated nine days later.

&quot;Lizardfish&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

===Postwar===
&quot;Lizardfish&quot; cleared Subic Bay on 31 August and set course for the West Coast, touched Pearl Harbor, and arrived San Francisco on 22 September. At Eureka, CA, 24 October for Navy Day celebrations, &quot;Lizardfish&quot; five days later tied up at Tiburon, CA, remaining there until 2 January 1946, when she got underway to act as schoolship for the Sonar School at San Diego. She completed her training services on 5 March and reported for inactivation at San Francisco. After operations off the California coast, she was decommissioned, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Mare Island Navy Yard, on 24 June 1946.

==&quot;Evangelista Torricelli&quot; (S 512)==

&quot;Lizardfish&quot; remained in reserve until 16 March 1959, when she departed for Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for Fleet Snorkel conversion and fitting out. She was transferred to the Government of Italy on 9 January 1960 and served the Italian Navy under the name &quot;Evangelista Torricelli&quot; (S 512). She was stripped of usable parts and the hull scrapped by the Italian Navy in 1976.

<doc id="1144404" wikidata="Q702964" url="?curid=1144404" title="Taft–Katsura agreement">
<text>The , also known as the Taft-Katsura Memorandum, was a 1905 discussion between senior leaders of Japan and the United States regarding the positions of the two nations in greater East Asian affairs, especially regarding the status of Korea and the Philippines in the aftermath of Japan&#x27;s victory during the Russo-Japanese War. The memorandum was not classified as a secret, but no scholar noticed it in the archives until 1924.

The discussions were between William Howard Taft, the United States Secretary of War and Count Katsura Tarō, the Japanese Prime Minister on 27 July 1905. Katsura stated Japan&#x27;s reasons for its making a protectorate of Korea and repeated that Japan had no interest in the Philippines, which the US had acquired after the defeat of Spain during the 1898 Spanish–American War.

In 1924, Tyler Dennett was the first scholar to see the document and described it as containing &quot;the text of perhaps the most remarkable &#x27;executive agreement&#x27; in the history of the foreign relations of the United States.&quot; The consensus of historians is that Dennett greatly exaggerated the importance of a routine discussion which changed nothing and set no new policies. Historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new. The word &quot;agreement&quot; in the documents meant merely the two sides agreed that both the English and Japanese versions of the notes of the meeting accurately covered the substance of the conversations. President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that Taft had correctly stated the American position.

When Dennett first discovered the notes, he assumed they indicated a highly-significant &quot;secret pact&quot; between the US and Japan in creating the basis of an agreement whereby the two formerly-isolationist nations became world powers. The conversations were regarding the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States and maintaining peace between them in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War.

==Details==
The Taft–Katsura Agreement consists of the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes of the conversation between Japanese Prime Minister Katsura and US Secretary of War Taft held in Tokyo on the morning of 27 July 1905. The memorandum detailing these discussions was dated 29 July 1905.

Three significant issues were discussed during the meeting:
* Katsura&#x27;s views on peace in East Asia formed, according to him, the fundamental principle of Japan&#x27;s foreign policy and were best accomplished by a good understanding among Japan, the United States, and Great Britain.
* On the Philippines, Taft observed that it was in Japan&#x27;s best interests to have the Philippines governed by a strong and friendly nation like the United States. Katsura claimed that Japan had no aggressive designs on the Philippines.
* Regarding Korea, Katsura observed that Japanese colonization of Korea was a matter of absolute importance, as he considered Korea to have been a direct cause of the recently-concluded Russo-Japanese War. Katsura stated that a comprehensive solution of the Korean problem would be the war&#x27;s logical outcome. Katsura further stated that if left alone, Korea would continue to join improvident agreements and treaties with other powers, which he said to have created the original problem. Therefore, he stated that Japan must take steps to prevent Korea from again creating conditions that would force Japan into fighting another foreign war.

Taft concurred that the establishment of a Japanese protectorate over Korea would directly contribute to stability in East Asia. Taft also expressed his belief that US President Theodore Roosevelt would concur in his views in this regard.

There were three substantive areas of understanding in the conversation. Firstly, Taft said to Katsura that some supporters of Russia in America were publicly claiming that the recent war was a prelude to certain aggression by Japan against the Philippine Islands. Taft stated that Japan&#x27;s only interest in the Philippines would be to have the islands governed by a strong and friendly nation like the United States. Count Katsura strongly confirmed that was Japan&#x27;s only interest in the Philippines and, since that was already the case, Japan had no aggressive interest toward the Philippines. 
Secondly, Count Katsura stated that Japan&#x27;s policy in East and Southeast Asia was to maintain general peace, which should be achieved by a good understanding between Japan, the United States, and Great Britain.

Thirdly, Count Katsura stated that because Korean autonomy had resulted in Korea improvidently entering into agreements and treaties with other powers, which had been the cause of international complications leading to the war between Japan and Russia. Japan, therefore, felt constrained to preclude any possibility of Korean autonomy. Taft stated that the establishment of a suzerainty of Japan over Korea (the less powerful Korea paying tribute to or being somewhat controlled by the more powerful Japan), with Japanese military troops enforcing a requirement for Korea to enter into no foreign treaties without the consent of Japan, was a logical result of the war and would contribute to permanent peace in the East. Taft also stated that his opinions were his own but that he believed that Roosevelt would concur.

Although there was never a signed agreement or secret treaty, only a memorandum of a conversation, and the conversations were kept secret for 20 years, Roosevelt commented to Taft, &quot;Your conversation with Count Katsura (sic) absolutely correct in every respect. Wish (sic) that you would state to Katsura that I confirm every word you said.&quot;

However, there is controversy among historians as to the historic significance of the conversation and as to whether the language of the conversation constituted an actual agreement in Realpolitik (an actual agreement was implied by the use of the language of diplomacy although it was not made explicit as a formal agreement).

The notes of the conversation were discovered in 1924 by the historian Tyler Dennett, who considered the notes to be of first-rate significance and asked permission for publication from Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Dennett referred to the notes as &quot;President Roosevelt&#x27;s Secret Pact With Japan.&quot;

==Context==
The Japanese had just destroyed two thirds of the Imperial Russian Navy during their war over Korea in 1905. Victory by Japan was clearly imminent. Roosevelt was trying to bring Russia and Japan to peace negotiations.

The United States had obtained control of the Philippines from its war against Spain in 1898. War Secretary Taft stopped by in Japan on his way to the Philippines.

==Korean interpretation==
Korean historians (such as Ki-baik Lee, author of &quot;A New History of Korea&quot;, Harvard U. Press, 1984) believe that the Taft–Katsura Agreement violated the Korean–American Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed at Incheon on May 22, 1882 because the Joseon government considered that treaty constituted a &quot;de facto&quot; mutual defense treaty, unlike the Americans. The problem was Article 1: &quot;There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the President of the United States and the King of Chosen and the citizens and subjects of their respective Governments. If other powers deal unjustly or oppressively with either Government, the other will exert their good offices on being informed of the case to bring about an amicable arrangement, thus showing their friendly feelings.&quot;

<text>The Hammersmith Apollo, currently called the Eventim Apollo for sponsorship reasons, and formerly and still commonly known as the Hammersmith Odeon, is a live entertainment performance venue, originally built as a cinema called the Gaumont Palace. Located in Hammersmith, London, it is an art deco Grade II* listed building.

==History==
Designed by Robert Cromie, who also renovated the Prince of Wales Theatre, in the Art Deco style, it opened in 1932 as the Gaumont Palace, with a seating capacity of nearly 3,500 people, being renamed the Hammersmith Odeon in 1962. It has had a string of names and owners, most recently AEG Live and Eventim UK. It became a Grade II listed building in 1990. The venue was later refurbished and renamed Labatt&#x27;s Apollo following a sponsorship deal with Labatt Brewing Company (1993 or 1994).

In 2002, the venue was again renamed, this time to Carling Apollo after Carling brewery struck a deal with the owners, US-based Clear Channel Entertainment, now IHeartMedia. The event was marked by rock band AC/DC playing a one-off concert. All 5,000 tickets sold out in 4 minutes. In 2003, the stalls seats were made removable and now some concerts have full seating whilst others have standing-only in the stalls. In the latter format, the venue can accommodate around 5,000 people. The venue&#x27;s listing was upgraded to Grade II* status in 2005. In 2006, the venue reverted to its former name, the Hammersmith Apollo. In 2007, the original 1932 Compton pipe organ, still present from the building&#x27;s days as a cinema, was restored. The building was then bought by the MAMA Group.

On 14 January 2009, a placing announcement by HMV Group revealed that by selling additional shares, the company would raise money to fund a joint venture with the MAMA Group, to run eleven live music venues across the United Kingdom, including the Hammersmith Apollo. As a result, the venue was named HMV Apollo from 2009 until 2012. Other venues purchased include The Forum in London&#x27;s Kentish Town, the Birmingham Institute and Aberdeen&#x27;s Moshulu. The venue was sold by HMV Group in May 2012 to AEG Live and CTS Eventim. In 2013, the venue was closed for an extensive refurbishment which was carried out by architect Foster Wilson. The venue reopened as the Eventim Apollo on 7 September 2013, with a concert performance by Selena Gomez.

== The Compton pipe organ ==

The original 1932 Compton pipe organ remains installed at the Apollo and was fully restored to playing condition in 2007. It has a four-manual console which rises through the stage on a new lift and about 1,200 organ pipes housed in large chambers above the front stalls ceiling. Having fallen into disrepair, the organ was disconnected in the 1990s and the console removed from the building. At the insistence of English Heritage and the local council, however, it was reinstated and the entire organ restored. At a launch party, on 25 July 2007, an invited audience and media representatives witnessed a recital by Richard Hills.

<text>Sir George Dashwood Taubman Goldie (20 May 1846 – 20 August 1925) was a Manx administrator who played a major role in the founding of Nigeria. In many ways, his role was similar to that of Cecil Rhodes elsewhere in Africa but he did not seek publicity.

==Early life==
George Goldie descended from an old Scottish family. Born at The Nunnery, Douglas in the Isle of Man, the youngest son of Lieutenant Colonel John Taubman Goldie-Taubman, Speaker of the House of Keys, by his second wife, Caroline Everina, daughter of John Eykyn Hovenden, a barrister of Hemingford Grey, Huntingdonshire. Sir George resumed his paternal name, Goldie, by Royal Licence in 1887.

He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and for about two years held a commission in the Royal Engineers. Unusually for the time, Goldie was a convinced atheist. 

In 1870, he married, Matilda (later known as &quot;Maude&quot;) Catherine, daughter of John William Elliott of Wakefield. He travelled in all parts of Africa, gaining an extensive knowledge of the continent, and first visited the country of the Niger in 1877.

==The National African Company==
He conceived the idea of adding to the British Empire the then little known regions of the lower and middle Niger, and for over twenty years his efforts were devoted to the realization of this conception. The method by which he determined to work was the revival of government by chartered companies within the empire, a method supposed to be buried with the British East India Company. The first step was to combine all British commercial interests in the Niger, and this he accomplished in 1879 when the United African Company was formed.

In 1881, Goldie sought a charter from Gladstone&#x27;s government. Objections of various kinds were raised. To meet them the capital of the company (renamed the National African Company) was increased from £250,000 to £1,000,000, and great energy was displayed in founding stations on the Niger.

At this time French traders, encouraged by Léon Gambetta, established themselves on the lower river, thus rendering it difficult for the company to obtain territorial rights; but the Frenchmen were bought out in 1884, so that at the Berlin Conference on West Africa in 1885, Goldie, present as an expert on matters relating to the river, was able to announce that on the lower Niger the British flag alone flew. Meantime the Niger coast line had been placed under British protection.
Through Joseph Thomson, David McIntosh, D. W. Sargent, J. Flint, William Wallace, E. Dangerfield and numerous other agents, over 400 political treaties drawn up by Goldie were made with the chiefs of the lower Niger and the Hausa states. The scruples of the British government being overcome, a charter was at length granted (July 1886), the National African Company becoming the Royal Niger Company, with Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare as governor and Goldie as vice-governor. In 1895, on Lord Aberdare&#x27;s death, Goldie became governor of the company, whose destinies he had guided throughout.

==German opposition==
The building up of Nigeria as a British state had to be carried on in face of further difficulties raised by French travellers with political missions, and also in face of German opposition. From 1884 to 1890, Otto von Bismarck was a persistent antagonist, and the strenuous efforts he made to secure for Germany the basin of the lower Niger and Lake Chad were even more dangerous to Goldie&#x27;s schemes of empire than the ambitions of France. Eduard Robert Flegel, who had travelled in Nigeria during 1882–1884 under the auspices of the British company, was sent out in 1885 by the newly formed German Colonial Society to secure treaties for Germany, which had established itself at Cameroon.

After Flegel&#x27;s death in 1886, his work was continued by his companion Dr Staudinger, while Herr Hoenigsberg was despatched to stir up trouble in the occupied portions of the company&#x27;s territory, or, as he expressed it, &quot;to burst up the charter&quot;. He was finally arrested at Onitsha, and, after trial by the company&#x27;s supreme court at Asaba, was expelled from the country. Bismarck then sent out his nephew, Herr von Puttkamer, as German consul general to Nigeria, with orders to report on this affair, and when, this report was published in a White Book, Bismarck demanded heavy damages from the company.

Meanwhile, Bismarck maintained constant pressure on the British government to compel the Royal Niger Company to a division of spheres of influence, whereby Great Britain would have lost a third, and the most valuable part, of the company&#x27;s territory. But he fell from power in March 1890 and, in July, following Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, concluded the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty with Germany. The aggressive action of Germany in Nigeria entirely ceased, and the door was opened for a final settlement of the Nigeria–Cameroon frontiers.

These negotiations, which resulted in an agreement in 1893, were initiated by Goldie as a means of arresting the advance of France into Nigeria from the direction of the Congo. By conceding to Germany a long but narrow strip of territory between Adamawa and Lake Chad, to which she had no treaty claims, a barrier was raised against French expeditions, semi-military and semi-exploratory, which sought to enter Nigeria from the east. Later French efforts at aggression were made from the western or Dahomeyan side, despite an agreement concluded with France in 1890 respecting the northern frontier.

==The end of the Company==
The hostility of certain Fula princes led the company to despatch, in 1897, an expedition against the Muslim states of Nupe and Ilorin. This expedition was organized and personally directed by Goldie and was completely successful. Internal peace was thus secured, but in the following year the differences with France in regard to the frontier line became acute, and compelled the intervention of the British government.

In the negotiations which ensued Goldie was instrumental in preserving for Great Britain the whole of the navigable stretch of the lower Niger. It was, however, evidently impossible for a chartered company to hold its own against the state-supported protectorates of France and Germany, and in consequence, on 1 January 1900, the Royal Niger Company transferred its territories to the British government for the sum of £865,000. The ceded territory together with the small Niger Coast Protectorate, already under imperial control, was formed into the two protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria.

==Later enterprises==
In 1903–1904, at the request of the Chartered Company of South Africa, Goldie visited Rhodesia and examined the situation in connection with the agitation for self-government by the Rhodesians. In 1902–1903 he was one of the Royal Commissioners who inquired into the military preparations for the war in South Africa (1899–1902) and into the operations up to the occupation of Pretoria, and in 1905–1906 was a member of the Royal Commission which investigated the methods of disposal of war stores after peace had been made.
==Later life==
Sir George Goldie died in 1925 at the age of 79 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery in London. He was survived by two children. His wife&#x27;s name on the tombstone is Lady Maude Goldie (1847–1898), reflecting her evident use of an alternative form of the name originating in Old German, &#x27;Matilda&#x27; being the Latin form; the same was the case with the Empress Matilda.

==Honours==
In 1905, he was elected President of the Royal Geographical Society and held that office for three years. In 1908 he was chosen as an Alderman of the London County Council. Goldie was created KCMG in 1887, and a Privy Councillor in 1898.

He became a Fellow of the Royal Society (1902), Honorary D.C.L. of the University of Oxford (1897) and Honorary LL.D. of the University of Cambridge (1897). In 1906, he was awarded the RSGS Livingstone Medal for his contribution to Geography

Sir George was also at some point Vice President of the Royal Colonial Institute.

*&quot;Pseudohaje goldii&quot; (Goldie&#x27;s tree cobra), a rare West African venomous snake, was named in Goldie&#x27;s honour by George Albert Boulenger in 1895.

==In popular culture==
Goldie was played by Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid in the 2016 historical drama &quot;The Lost City of Z.&quot;

<doc id="1144453" wikidata="Q2860136" url="?curid=1144453" title="Chinese school">
<text>A Chinese school () is a school that is established for the purpose of teaching the varieties of Chinese (in particular, Mandarin and Cantonese), though the purpose can vary to teaching different aspects of Chinese culture such as Chinese art, calligraphy, history and martial arts. The programs can either be an independent institution or a part of an existing educational institution. 

Many Chinese schools are purposed to preserve traditional Chinese language and culture. In 2007, &quot;USA Today&quot; dubbed Chinese &quot;... is the new English.&quot; A recent trend in 2011 shows that the Chinese government has also provided funding to U.S. school districts with additional funding on top of funding they already receive from the U.S. government. As a result, there has also been concern that the Chinese government may also be infiltrating the education system outside its borders, as some people at a school district in Columbus, Ohio, feel it has done.

==Curriculum==
A typical Chinese school curriculum can vary depending on the particular school. However, the Standard Chinese language and various aspects of Chinese culture such as Chinese art, Chinese history and Chinese martial arts are typically included.

===Chinese language===
The Chinese language is spoken by nearly 1.2 billion people or about 16% of the world&#x27;s population. Chinese schools typically teach both written and spoken Chinese. With the growing importance and influence of China&#x27;s economy globally, Mandarin instruction is gaining popularity in schools in the United States, and has become an increasingly popular subject of study amongst the young in the Western world, as in the UK. One of the teaching tools used widely in Chinese schools is the Pinyin system, also known as the official phonetic system for transcribing the Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet which was developed in the 1950s based on earlier forms of romanization. It was published by the Chinese government in 1958 and revised several times. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982.

===Chinese calligraphy===
Written Chinese as taught in Chinese schools uses methods as defined by the Shūfǎ (書法) from China, which means &quot;the way/method/law of writing&quot;. Curricula in Chinese writing typically focus on stroke order and repetition. Schools also teach the relationship of words based on their Chinese radicals, as many words come from ideas that relate to a particular topic. Stroke orders of words are also important as they dictate how Chinese words can be found in a Chinese dictionary.

===Chinese art===

Chinese art is taught in Chinese schools following the techniques as established in Chinese painting. For example:
* Gong-bi (工筆), meaning &quot;meticulous&quot;, uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely. It is often highly coloured and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects. It is often practised by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops. Bird-and-flower paintings were often in this style.
* Ink and wash painting, in Chinese &quot;Shui-mo&quot; or (水墨) also loosely termed watercolour or brush painting, and also known as &quot;literati painting&quot;, as it was one of the &quot;four arts&quot; of the Chinese Scholar-official class. In theory this was an art practised by gentlemen, a distinction that begins to be made in writings on art from the Song dynasty, though in fact the careers of leading exponents could benefit considerably. This style is also referred to as &quot;xie yi&quot; (寫意) or freehand style.

===Chinese martial arts===

Chinese martial arts, sometimes called &quot;kung fu&quot; are a number of fighting styles that have developed over the centuries in China. Chinese schools often offer such programs as part of their curriculum as it is one of the fundamental aspects of Chinese culture. Though some martial art styles may have originated in other parts of Asia such as karate and tae kwon do, they are sometimes taught as though it were part of the Chinese heritage.

==Major events==

===Chinese New Year===

Many Chinese schools put on a Chinese New Year gala as the festival is an important Chinese festival celebrated at the turn of the Chinese calendar. It is also known as the Spring Festival, the literal translation of the modern Chinese name. Chinese New Year celebrations traditionally run from Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve, the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first month, making the festival the longest in the Chinese calendar. The first day of the New Year falls between January 21 and February 20.

Other cultures and languages have similar setups. For example:

*English as a second or foreign language

== History ==
Before white settlement Bowen Hills was occupied by the indigenous Chepara people including the Brisbane, Ipswich and southern Jagera people. The higher parts were named Barrambin meaning windy place because they caught the breezes. It was one of the main campsites for the region, part of the Spring Hill, City area, where on occasions 700 to 1000 people were camped, including Brisbane locals, groups from Ipswich, the Tweed Valley, Wivenhoe, Rosewood, Logan, Stradbroke, North Pine and beyond.

The area now occupied by the grounds of the Brisbane Exhibition Ground and Royal Brisbane and Women&#x27;s Hospital was named Walan (Woolan), meaning Bream (fish). The area of the present main Ekka oval was a &quot;great fighting ground for the blacks&quot; . Barrambin was an important location for &quot;kippa-ring&quot; or initiation ceremony. Tribes from the coast would travel here to have their &quot;kippa&#x27;s&quot; (young men) initiated. Early European settlement named the area beside Gilchrist Avenue York&#x27;s Hollow.

The suburb was named after Queensland Governor Sir George Ferguson Bowen.

The locality of Mayne is named after alderman Patrick Mayne.

The Queensland Acclimatisation Society occupied Bowen Park in 1862, the area later known as the RNA Exhibition Grounds and home to the Brisbane Ekka, although part of it still remains as parkland.

In 1866 Bowen Hills was defined as a postal district. Settlement increased in the 1870s. A post office was opened in 1878. The train station was opened in 1882.

<doc id="1144483" wikidata="Q378954" url="?curid=1144483" title="Adult FriendFinder">
<text>Adult FriendFinder (AFF) is an internet-based, adult-oriented social networking service, online dating service and swinger personals community website, founded by Andrew Conru in 1996.

In 2007 AFF was one of the 100 most popular sites in the United States; its competitors include sites such as Match.com.

==History==
In 1993, Andrew Conru created the first online dating site, WebPersonals. After selling that site in 1995, he launched FriendFinder.com, an early social networking site, in 1996. Days after the site went live, Conru found that people were posting naked pictures of themselves and seeking partners for adult-oriented activities. As a result, Conru started Adult FriendFinder, which he described as &quot;a release valve&quot;. FriendFinder has since established other niche dating sites, including Senior FriendFinder, Amigos.com, BigChurch.com, and Alt.com.

The parent company (Various, Inc.) had difficulty finding venture capital due to the adult nature of its business. In December 2007, the company was sold to the Penthouse Media Group for $500 million. Penthouse later changed its name to FriendFinder Networks. In October 2009, as part of an arrangement with The Kluger Agency, musician Flo Rida released a music video for his song &quot;Touch Me&quot; via Adult FriendFinder. A representative of the agency stated that it was &quot;always great to combine a very sexy high octane record with a very sexy brand.

On September 17, 2013, parent company FriendFinder Networks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In December 2013, FriendFinder Networks emerged from bankruptcy protection with reorganization in effect. Founder Andrew Conru gained control of the company and is CEO.

==Overview==
Accessing certain features, such as e-mail, private chat rooms, webcams, blogging, and a webzine, requires paid membership. Adult FriendFinder has an affiliate program, whereby webmasters are compensated for referring users to the site.

==Criticism==
Adult FriendFinder has been accused of committing systematic billing fraud. According to the complaints filed, the company has a practice of continuing to bill customers even after they have cancelled their service. Former employees of the company have claimed that this is their standard policy and not the result of errors. These employees have stated that the majority of customers do not notice the charges for many months. As of October 2014, hundreds of civil cases have been filed against the company and a criminal indictment was made by the Federal Trade Commission against the company. In 2007, Adult FriendFinder settled with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that the company had used malware to generate explicit pop-up ads for the service on computers without user consent.

Adult FriendFinder&#x27;s acquisition by Penthouse was the subject of a 2007 lawsuit by Broadstream Capital Partners, a merchant bank that assists with mergers, alleging Penthouse breached a 2006 contract by purchasing the company without obtaining Broadstream&#x27;s consent, a claim Penthouse denies. The suit was settled for $15 million in 2011.

== Security breaches ==
In May 2015, Adult FriendFinder was hacked by users associated with the Hell forums, with the hackers stealing personal information about as many as four million of the site&#x27;s users.

On November 13, 2016, it was reported that a database of usernames, e-mails, and passwords had been breached and leaked from Adult FriendFinder and other FriendFinder Networks websites. The breach included 300 million Adult FriendFinder user accounts, including account data for 15 million accounts that had supposedly been &quot;deleted&quot;. The passwords had either been stored in plain text, or hashed without a salt with the obsolete and insecure SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

==Awards==
The site won the 2010 XBIZ Award for &quot;Dating Program of the Year&quot;. It was also voted Best Adult Dating Site of 2012 from About.com. In 2022 the site won the XBIZ Award for &quot;Dating Company of the Year&quot;.

<doc id="1144486" wikidata="Q7286922" url="?curid=1144486" title="Raleigh International">
<text>Raleigh International is a youth expedition organisation based in the UK. 

Volunteers work in remote, rural areas to improve access to safe water and sanitation, build community resilience, sustainably manage natural resources and to protect vulnerable environments.

Established in 1984 as Operation Raleigh, 40,000 young people have been part of a Raleigh expedition.

==Raleigh International&#x27;s work==
Raleigh International operates in Costa Rica and South Africa, with permanent offices in these countries. Long-term partnerships have been established with local communities, NGOs and government departments, ensuring projects are needed and sustainable. Past countries have included Chile, Ghana, Namibia, Malaysia, Mongolia and Fiji.

All volunteers are trained and supported to work alongside communities living in poverty. They work in remote, rural areas to improve access to safe water and sanitation, build community resilience, sustainably manage natural resources, and protect vulnerable environments. This is carried out in a number of ways, through raising awareness of health and hygiene, sustainable farming methods, as well as the construction of early childhood development centres, community buildings, rocket stoves and other infrastructure.

===Expeditions===
Raleigh International runs expeditions in Costa Rica, Tanzania and Nepal for individuals aged 17–75, of any nationality or background. Volunteers (aged 17–24) work on community and environmental projects as well as undertaking tough adventure challenges, and are supported by volunteer managers (aged 25–75). Expeditions are 5, 7, or 10 weeks for venturers and 8 or 13 weeks for volunteer managers.

===International Citizen Service===
Raleigh&#x27;s International Citizen Service (ICS) program is funded by the UK government&#x27;s Department for International Development and led by VSO in partnership with other respected development organizations. The programme comprises two opportunities, ICS and ICS Entrepreneur. UK volunteers aged 18–25 spend 10–12 weeks in Nepal, Nicaragua, or Tanzania working alongside local volunteers on community development projects.

==History==
John Blashford-Snell and Prince Charles launched Operation Drake in 1978, running youth projects from ships circumnavigating the globe, to develop self-confidence and leadership through adventure, scientific exploration and community service. In two years 414 young people took part in the round the world voyage, working on land-based projects in 16 countries.

Following the success of Operation Drake, the much more ambitious Operation Raleigh was established in 1984, and ran for five years until 1989. Two renovated ships,&quot;Sir Walter Raleigh&quot; and &quot;Zebu&quot;, carried 4,000 volunteers and almost 1,600 staff to take part in expeditions around the world.

The success of Operation Raleigh saw it continue on a permanent basis in 1988, with an emphasis on land-based expeditions. It became Raleigh International in 1992, reflecting the growing diversity of expedition volunteers. In 1994, transworld walker Ffyona Campbell completed the last leg of her walk around the world, which ran from Dover to John O&#x27;Groats, with the logistical support of, and raising funds for, Raleigh International. Today over 40,000 people have been part of a Raleigh programme, and Raleigh continued to work with young people alongside communities living in poverty across the world.

On 19 May 2022 Raleigh International Trust ceased operations and entered Creditors&#x27; Voluntary Liquidation. The Raleigh International brand was bought by Impact Travel Group on 11 July 2022 and has relaunched with new expeditions in 2023.

==Alumni==
Notable Raleigh alumni include:

* The Princess of Wales - Chile, 2001.
* The Prince of Wales - Chile, 2000.
* Tim Peake, astronaut with European Space Agency - Alaska, 1991.
* Kate Silverton, BBC News presenter - Operation Raleigh, 1990.
* Ray Mears, TV Bushcraft Instructor - Operation Raleigh.
* Simon Chinn, double Academy award-winning film producer - Panama, 1988.
* Claire Bertschinger, nurse and activist - Operation Drake, 1978.

<doc id="1144487" wikidata="Q646427" url="?curid=1144487" title="Encephalization quotient">
<text>Encephalization quotient (EQ), encephalization level (EL), or just encephalization is a relative brain size measure that is defined as the ratio between observed and predicted brain mass for an animal of a given size, based on nonlinear regression on a range of reference species. It has been used as a proxy for intelligence and thus as a possible way of comparing the intelligence levels of different species. For this purpose, it is a more refined measurement than the raw brain-to-body mass ratio, as it takes into account allometric effects. Expressed as a formula, the relationship has been developed for mammals and may not yield relevant results when applied outside this group.

== Perspective on intelligence measures ==

Encephalization quotient was developed in an attempt to provide a way of correlating an animal&#x27;s physical characteristics with perceived intelligence. It improved on the previous attempt, brain-to-body mass ratio, so it has persisted. Subsequent work, notably Roth, found EQ to be flawed and suggested brain size was a better predictor, but that has problems as well.

Currently the best predictor for intelligence across all animals is forebrain neuron count. This was not seen earlier because neuron counts were previously inaccurate for most animals. For example, human brain neuron count was given as 100 billion for decades before Herculano-Houzel found a more reliable method of counting brain cells.

It could have been anticipated that EQ might be superseded because of both the number of exceptions and the growing complexity of the formulae it used. (See the rest of this article.) The simplicity of counting neurons has replaced it. The concept in EQ of comparing the brain capacity exceeding that required for body sense and motor activity may yet live on to provide an even better prediction of intelligence, but that work has not been done yet.

=== Variance in brain sizes ===
Body size accounts for 80–90% of the variance in brain size, between species, and a relationship described by an allometric equation: the regression of the logarithms of brain size on body size. The distance of a species from the regression line is a measure of its encephalization. The scales are logarithmic, distance, or residual, is an encephalization quotient (EQ), the ratio of actual brain size to expected brain size. Encephalization is a characteristic of a species.

Rules for brain size relates to the number brain neurons have varied in evolution, then not all mammalian brains are necessarily built as larger or smaller versions of a same plan, with proportionately larger or smaller numbers of neurons. Similarly sized brains, such as a cow or chimpanzee, might in that scenario contain very different numbers of neurons, just as a very large cetacean brain might contain fewer neurons than a gorilla brain. Size comparison between the human brain and non-primate brains, larger or smaller, might simply be inadequate and uninformative – and our view of the human brain as outlier, a special oddity, may have been based on the mistaken assumption that all brains are made the same (Herculano-Houzel, 2012).

=== Limitations and possible improvements over EQ ===
There is a distinction between brain parts that are necessary for the maintenance of the body and those that are associated with improved cognitive functions. These brain parts, although functionally different, all contribute to the overall weight of the brain. Jerison (1973) has for this reason considered &#x27;extra neurons&#x27;, neurons that contribute strictly to cognitive capacities, as more important indicators of intelligence than pure EQ. Gibson et al. (2001) reasoned that bigger brains generally contain more &#x27;extra neurons&#x27; and thus are better predictors of cognitive abilities than pure EQ among primates.

Factors such as the recent evolution of the cerebral cortex and different degrees of brain folding (gyrification), which increases the surface area (and volume) of the cortex, are positively correlated to intelligence in humans.

In a meta-analysis, Deaner et al. (2007) tested absolute brain size (ABS), cortex size, cortex-to-brain ratio, EQ, and corrected relative brain size (cRBS) against global cognitive capacities. They have found that, after normalization, only ABS and neocortex size showed significant correlation to cognitive abilities. In primates, ABS, neocortex size, and N (the number of cortical neurons) correlated fairly well with cognitive abilities. However, there were inconsistencies found for N. According to the authors, these inconsistencies were the result of the faulty assumption that N increases linearly with the size of the cortical surface. This notion is incorrect because the assumption does not take into account the variability in cortical thickness and cortical neuron density, which should influence N.

According to Cairo (2011), EQ has flaws to its design when considering individual data points rather than a species as a whole. It is inherently biased given that the cranial volume of an obese and underweight individual would be roughly similar, but their body masses would be drastically different. Another difference of this nature is a lack of accounting for sexual dimorphism. For example, the female human generally has smaller cranial volume than the male; however, this does not mean that a female and male of the same body mass would have different cognitive abilities. Considering all of these flaws, EQ should not be viewed as a valid metric for intraspecies comparison.

The notion that encephalization quotient corresponds to intelligence has been disputed by Roth and Dicke (2012). They consider the absolute number of cortical neurons and neural connections as better correlates of cognitive ability. According to Roth and Dicke (2012), mammals with relatively high cortex volume and neuron packing density (NPD) are more intelligent than mammals with the same brain size. The human brain stands out from the rest of the mammalian and vertebrate taxa because of its large cortical volume and high NPD, conduction velocity, and cortical parcellation. All aspects of human intelligence are found, at least in its primitive form, in other nonhuman primates, mammals, or vertebrates, with the exception of syntactical language. Roth and Dicke consider syntactical language an &quot;intelligence amplifier&quot;.

== Brain-body size relationship ==

Brain size usually increases with body size in animals (is positively correlated), i.e. large animals usually have larger brains than smaller animals. The relationship is not linear, however. Generally, small mammals have relatively larger brains than big ones. Mice have a direct brain/body size ratio similar to humans (1/40), while elephants have a comparatively small brain/body size (1/560), despite being quite intelligent animals. Treeshrews have a brain/body mass ratio of (1/10).

Several reasons for this trend are possible, one of which is that neural cells have a relative constant size. Some brain functions, like the brain pathway responsible for a basic task like drawing breath, are basically similar in a mouse and an elephant. Thus, the same amount of brain matter can govern breathing in a large or a small body. While not all control functions are independent of body size, some are, and hence large animals need comparatively less brain than small animals. This phenomenon can be described by an equation formula_1 
where formula_2 and formula_3 are brain and body weights respectively, and formula_4 is called the cephalization factor. To determine the value of this factor, the brain and body weights of various mammals were plotted against each other, and the curve of such formula chosen as the best fit to that data.

The cephalization factor and the subsequent encephalization quotient was developed by H. J. Jerison in the late 1960s. The formula for the curve varies, but an empirical fitting of the formula to a sample of mammals gives
formula_5
As this formula is based on data from mammals, it should be applied to other animals with caution. For some of the other vertebrate classes the power of 3/4 rather than 2/3 is sometimes used, and for many groups of invertebrates the formula may give no meaningful results at all.

==Calculation==
Snell&#x27;s equation of simple allometry is
:formula_6
were formula_2 is the weight of the brain, formula_4 is the cephalization factor, formula_3 is body weight, and formula_10 is the exponential constant.

The &quot;encephalization quotient&quot; (EQ) is the coefficient formula_4 in Snell&#x27;s allometry equation, usually normalized with respect to a reference species. In the following table, the coefficients have been normalized with respect to the value for the cat, which is therefore attributed an EQ of 1.

Another way to calculate encephalization quotient is by dividing the actual weight of an animal&#x27;s brain with its predicted weight according to Jerison&#x27;s formula.

This measurement of approximate intelligence is more accurate for mammals than for other classes and phyla of Animalia.

==EQ and intelligence in mammals==
Intelligence in animals is hard to establish, but the larger the brain is relative to the body, the more brain weight might be available for more complex cognitive tasks. The EQ formula, as opposed to the method of simply measuring raw brain weight or brain weight to body weight, makes for a ranking of animals that coincides better with observed complexity of behaviour. A primary reason for the use of EQ instead of a simple brain to body mass ratio is that smaller animals tend to have a higher proportional brain mass, but do not show the same indications of higher cognition as animals with a high EQ.

=== Grey floor ===
The driving theorization behind the development of EQ is that an animal of a certain size requires a minimum number of neurons for basic functioning, sometimes referred to as a grey floor. There is also a limit to how large an animal&#x27;s brain can grow given its body size – due to limitations like gestation period, energetics, and the need to physically support the encephalized region throughout maturation. When normalizing a standard brain size for a group of animals, a slope can be determined to show what a species&#x27; expected brain to body mass ratio would be. Species with brain to body mass ratios below this standard are nearing the grey floor, and do not need extra grey matter. Species which fall above this standard have more grey matter than is necessary for basic functions. Presumably these extra neurons are used for higher cognitive processes.

=== Taxonomic trends ===
Mean EQ for mammals is around 1, with carnivorans, cetaceans and primates above 1, and insectivores and herbivores below. Large mammals tend to have the highest EQs of all animals, while small mammals and avians have similar EQs. This reflects two major trends. One is that brain matter is extremely costly in terms of energy needed to sustain it. Animals with nutrient rich diets tend to have higher EQs, which is necessary for the energetically costly tissue of brain matter. Not only is it metabolically demanding to grow throughout embryonic and postnatal development, it is costly to maintain as well.

Arguments have been made that some carnivores may have higher EQ&#x27;s due to their relatively enriched diets, as well as the cognitive capacity required for effectively hunting prey. One example of this is brain size of a wolf; about 30% larger than a similarly sized domestic dog, potentially derivative of different needs in their respective way of life.

=== Dietary trends ===
Of the animals demonstrating the highest EQ&#x27;s (see associated table), many are primarily frugivores, including apes, macaques, and proboscideans. This dietary categorization is significant to inferring the pressures which drive higher EQ&#x27;s. Specifically, frugivores must utilize a complex, trichromatic map of visual space to locate and pick ripe fruits and are able to provide for the high energetic demands of increased brain mass.

Trophic level—&quot;height&quot; on the food chain—is yet another factor that has been correlated with EQ in mammals. Eutheria with either high AB (absolute brain-mass) or high EQ occupy positions at high trophic levels. Eutheria low on the network of food chains can only develop a high RB (relative brain-mass) so long as they have small body masses. This presents an interesting conundrum for intelligent small animals, who have behaviors radically different from intelligent large animals. 

According to Steinhausen &quot;et al&quot;.(2016): Animals with high RB [relative brain-mass] usually have (1) a short life span, (2) reach sexual maturity early, and (3) have short and frequent gestations. Moreover, males of species with high RB also have few potential sexual partners. In contrast, animals with high EQs have (1) a high number of potential sexual partners, (2) delayed sexual maturity, and (3) rare gestations with small litter sizes.

=== Sociality ===
Another factor previously thought to have great impact on brain size is sociality and flock size. This was a long-standing theory until the correlation between frugivory and EQ was shown to be more statistically significant. While no longer the predominant inference as to selection pressure for high EQ, the social brain hypothesis still has some support. For example, dogs (a social species) have a higher EQ than cats (a mostly solitary species). Animals with very large flock size and/or complex social systems consistently score high EQ, with dolphins and orcas having the highest EQ of all cetaceans, and humans with their extremely large societies and complex social life topping the list by a good margin.

== Comparisons with non-mammalian animals ==
Birds generally have lower EQ than mammals, but parrots and particularly the corvids show remarkable complex behaviour and high learning ability. Their brains are at the high end of the bird spectrum, but low compared to mammals. Bird cell size is on the other hand generally smaller than that of mammals, which may mean more brain cells and hence synapses per volume, allowing for more complex behaviour from a smaller brain. Both bird intelligence and brain anatomy are however very different from those of mammals, making direct comparison difficult.

Manta rays have the highest EQ among fish, and either octopuses or jumping spiders have the highest among invertebrates. Despite the jumping spider having a huge brain for its size, it is minuscule in absolute terms, and humans have a much higher EQ despite having a lower raw brain-to-body weight ratio. Mean EQs for reptiles are about one tenth of those of mammals. EQ in birds (and estimated EQ in other dinosaurs) generally also falls below that of mammals, possibly due to lower thermoregulation and/or motor control demands. Estimation of brain size in &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; (one of the oldest known ancestors of birds), shows it had an EQ well above the reptilian range, and just below that of living birds.

Biologist Stephen Jay Gould has noted that if one looks at vertebrates with very low encephalization quotients, their brains are slightly less massive than their spinal cords. Theoretically, intelligence might correlate with the absolute amount of brain an animal has after subtracting the weight of the spinal cord from the brain. This formula is useless for invertebrates because they do not have spinal cords or, in some cases, central nervous systems.

==EQ in paleoneurology==
Behavioral complexity in living animals can to some degree be observed directly, making the predictive power of the encephalization quotient less relevant. It is however central in paleoneurology, where the endocast of the brain cavity and estimated body weight of an animal is all one has to work from. The behavior of extinct mammals and dinosaurs is typically investigated using EQ formulas.

Encephalization quotient is also used in estimating evolution of intelligent behavior in human ancestors. This technique can help in mapping the development of behavioral complexities during human evolution. However, this technique is only limited to when there are both cranial and post-cranial remains associated with individual fossils, to allow for brain to body size comparisons. For example, remains of one Middle Pleistocene human fossil from Jinniushan province in northern China has allowed scientists to study the relationship between brain and body size using the Encephalization Quotient. Researchers obtained an EQ of 4.150 for the Jinniushan fossil, and then compared this value with preceding Middle Pleistocene estimates of EQ at 3.7770. The difference in EQ estimates has been associated with a rapid increase in encephalization in Middle Pleistocene hominins.
Paleo-neurological comparisons between Neanderthals and anatomically modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (AMHS) via Encephalization quotient often rely on the use of endocasts, but this method has many drawbacks. For example, endocasts do not provide any information regarding the internal organization of the brain. Furthermore, endocasts are often unclear in terms of the preservation of their boundaries, and it becomes hard to measure where exactly a certain structure starts and ends. If endocasts themselves are not reliable, then the value for brain size used to calculate the EQ could also be unreliable. Additionally, previous studies have suggested that Neanderthals have the same encephalization quotient as modern humans, although their post-crania suggests that they weighed more than modern humans. Because EQ relies on values from both postcrania and crania, the margin for error increases in relying on this proxy in paleo-neurology because of the inherent difficulty in obtaining accurate brain and body mass measurements from the fossil record.

==EQ of livestock animals==
The EQ of livestock farm animals such as the domestic pig may be significantly lower than would suggest for their apparent intelligence. According to Minervini et al (2016) the brain of the domestic pig is a rather small size compared to the mass of the animal. The tremendous increase in body weight imposed by industrial farming significantly influences brain-to-body weight measures, including the EQ. The EQ of the domestic adult pig is just 0.38, yet pigs can use visual information seen in a mirror to find food, show evidence of self-recognition when presented with their reflections and there is evidence suggesting that pigs are as socially complex as many other highly intelligent animals, possibly sharing a number of cognitive capacities related to social complexity.

==History==
The concept of encephalization has been a key evolutionary trend throughout human evolution, and consequently an important area of study. Over the course of hominin evolution, brain size has seen an overall increase from 400 cm3 to 1400 cm3. Furthermore, the genus &quot;Homo&quot; is specifically defined by a significant increase in brain size. The earliest &quot;Homo&quot; species were larger in brain size as compared to contemporary &quot;Australopithecus&quot; counterparts, with which they co-inhabited parts of Eastern and Southern Africa.

Throughout modern history, humans have been fascinated by the large relative size of our brains, trying to connect brain sizes to overall levels of intelligence. Early brain studies were focused in the field of phrenology, which was pioneered by Franz Joseph Gall in 1796 and remained a prevalent discipline throughout the early 19th century. Specifically, phrenologists paid attention to the external morphology of the skull, trying to relate certain lumps to corresponding aspects of personality. They further measured physical brain size in order to equate larger brain sizes to greater levels of intelligence. Today, however, phrenology is considered a pseudoscience.

Among ancient Greek philosophers, Aristotle in particular believed that after the heart, the brain was the second most important organ of the body. He also focused on the size of the human brain, writing in 335 BCE that &quot;of all the animals, man has the brain largest in proportion to his size.&quot; In 1861, French neurologist Paul Broca tried to make a connection between brain size and intelligence. Through observational studies, he noticed that people working in what he deemed to be more complex fields had larger brains than people working in less complex fields. Also, in 1871, Charles Darwin wrote in his book &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;: &quot;No one, I presume, doubts that the large proportion which the size of man&#x27;s brain bears to his body, compared to the same proportion in the gorilla or orang, is closely connected with his mental powers.&quot; The concept of quantifying encephalization is also not a recent phenomenon. In 1889, Sir Francis Galton, through a study on college students, attempted to quantify the relationship between brain size and intelligence.

Due to Hitler&#x27;s racial policies during World War II, studies on brain size and intelligence temporarily gained a negative reputation. However, with the advent of imaging techniques such as the fMRI and PET scan, several scientific studies were launched to suggest a relationship between encephalization and advanced cognitive abilities. Harry J. Jerison, who invented the formula for encephalization quotient, believed that brain size was proportional to the ability of humans to process information. With this belief, a higher level of encephalization equated to a higher ability to process information. A larger brain could mean a number of different things, including a larger cerebral cortex, a greater number of neuronal associations, or a greater number of neurons overall.

<doc id="1144503" wikidata="Q6155194" url="?curid=1144503" title="Janner">
<text>Janner is an English regional nickname associated with Plymouth both as a noun and as an adjective for the local accent and dialect. In 1987 Cyril Tawney, in his book &quot;Grey Funnel Lines&quot;, described its meaning as &quot;a person from Devon&quot;, deriving from Cousin Jan (the Devon form of John), but &quot;more particularly in naval circles anyone from the Plymouth area&quot;. The term was also used for members of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment.

From March 1902 until November 1905 the &quot;Devon and Exeter Gazette&quot; ran a series &quot;The Talk at Uncle Tom Cobleigh&#x27;s Club&quot;, partly comic, partly serious, written in the Devonshire dialect. A second series was created by A. J. Coles and published in the &quot;(Illustrated) Western Weekly News&quot; from July 1905 until the paper ceased publication in October 1939. The series was continued in the &quot;Western Times and Gazette&quot; until 1964. Both series included the character Jan Stewer (a character from Widecombe Fair) who recounted his experiences of the modern world in Devon dialect. Coles&#x27;s mother was from Willand in Devon. The first series sparked a popular correspondence from Devon natives around the world written in affectionate dialect as recollected at the time, the character even appearing on the BBC in the 1920s.

Because of the changes in the local economy in Plymouth over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, from the Royal Navy being the major employer to Plymouth being a university city housing a large number of students from outside the city, the term has developed an additional secondary pejorative sense describing the locals.

The Member of Parliament for Plymouth, Devonport, Alison Seabeck, showed her ignorance of the term in 2005 when, while still a candidate, she was asked by the local paper: &quot;What is a Janner?&quot; The &quot;Express on Sunday&quot; reported her reply: The flustered candidate wailed: &quot;I don&#x27;t know. You&#x27;re not going to print this, are you?&quot; Unfortunately they did. The answer is a &quot;Plymothian&quot;.

For many years there was a cartoon in the &quot;Plymouth Evening Herald&quot; entitled &#x27;The Janners&#x27;. Many pamphlets circulate with mischievous amusing and sometimes erotic anthologies and there are short dictionaries of Janner vocabulary, e.g. the Janner TextBook.

The term features in the football team Plymouth Argyle supporters&#x27; chants, particularly its variant on the folksong &quot;Oggy Land&quot;, and in 2010 it was used in a television advertisement for Aviva Car Insurance in which Paul Whitehouse as a Plymouth Argyle supporter driving to an away match exhorts a potential passenger to &quot;geddon you Janner&quot;. In April 2012 a new rugby league trophy called the Barum Janner cup was introduced for competition matches between Barnstaple&#x27;s North Devon Raiders and the Plymouth Titans. The cup&#x27;s name is a combination of the nicknames for inhabitants of the two places.

<text>The Fick principle states that blood flow to an organ can be calculated using a marker substance if the following information is known:
* Amount of marker substance taken up by the organ per unit time
* Concentration of marker substance in arterial blood supplying the organ
* Concentration of marker substance in venous blood leaving the organ

Developed by Adolf Eugen Fick (1829–1901), the Fick principle has been applied to the measurement of cardiac output. Its underlying principles may also be applied in a variety of clinical situations.

In Fick&#x27;s original method, the &quot;organ&quot; was the entire human body and the marker substance was oxygen. The first published mention was in conference proceedings from July 9, 1870 from a lecture he gave at that conference; it is this publishing that is most often used by articles to cite Fick&#x27;s contribution.The principle may be applied in different ways. For example, if the blood flow to an organ is known, together with the arterial and venous concentrations of the marker substance, the uptake of marker substance by the organ may then be calculated.

==Variables==
In Fick&#x27;s original method, the following variables are measured:

* V̇O2, oxygen consumption in mL of pure gaseous oxygen per minute. This may be measured using a spirometer within a closed rebreathing circuit incorporating a CO2 absorber
* &quot;Ca&quot;, the oxygen content of blood taken from the pulmonary vein (representing oxygenated blood = arterial blood)
* &quot;Cv&quot;, the oxygen content of blood from an intravenous cannula (representing deoxygenated blood)

==Equation==
From these values, we know that:
:formula_1
where
* &quot;CO&quot; = Cardiac Output
* &quot;Ca&quot; = Oxygen content of arterial blood
* &quot;Cv&quot; = Oxygen content of mixed venous blood

This allows us to say
:formula_2
and hence calculate cardiac output.

Note that (&quot;Ca&quot; – &quot;Cv&quot;) is also known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference.

==Assumed Fick determination==
In reality, this method is rarely used due to the difficulty of collecting and analysing the gas concentrations. However, by using an assumed value for oxygen consumption, cardiac output can be closely approximated without the cumbersome and time-consuming oxygen consumption measurement. This is sometimes called an assumed Fick determination.

A commonly used value for O2 consumption at rest is O2 per minute per square meter of body surface area.

==Underlying principles==
The Fick principle relies on the observation that the total uptake of (or release of) a substance by the peripheral tissues is equal to the product of the blood flow to the peripheral tissues and the arterial-venous concentration difference (gradient) of the substance. In the determination of cardiac output, the substance most commonly measured is the oxygen content of blood thus giving the arteriovenous oxygen difference, and the flow calculated is the flow across the pulmonary system. This gives a simple way to calculate the cardiac output:

:formula_3

Assuming there is no intracardiac shunt, the pulmonary blood flow equals the systemic blood flow. Measurement of the arterial and venous oxygen content of blood involves the sampling of blood from the pulmonary artery (low oxygen content) and from the pulmonary vein (high oxygen content). In practice, sampling of peripheral arterial blood is a surrogate for pulmonary venous blood. Determination of the oxygen consumption of the peripheral tissues is more complex.

The calculation of the arterial and venous oxygen concentration of the blood is a straightforward process. Almost all oxygen in the blood is bound to hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells. Measuring the content of hemoglobin in the blood and the percentage of saturation of hemoglobin (the oxygen saturation of the blood) is a simple process and is readily available to physicians. Using the fact that each gram of hemoglobin can carry of O2, the oxygen content of the blood (either arterial or venous) can be estimated by the following formula:

:formula_4

Assuming a hemoglobin concentration of and an oxygen saturation of 99%, the oxygen concentration of arterial blood is approximately of O2 per L.

The saturation of mixed venous blood is approximately 75% in health. Using this value in the above equation, the oxygen concentration of mixed venous blood is approximately of O2 per L.

Therefore, using the assumed Fick determination, the approximated cardiac output for an average man (1.9 m3) is:

:Cardiac Output = ( O2/minute × 1.9) / ( O2/L − O2/L) = 

Cardiac output may also be estimated with the Fick principle using production of carbon dioxide as a marker substance.

==Use in renal physiology==
The principle can also be used in renal physiology to calculate renal blood flow.

In this context, it is not oxygen which is measured, but a marker such as para-aminohippurate. However, the principles are essentially the same.

<doc id="1144511" wikidata="Q143664" url="?curid=1144511" title="Dvůr Králové nad Labem">
<text>Dvůr Králové nad Labem (, ) is a town in Trutnov District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 15,000 inhabitants. It lies in the Elbe river valley. Dvůr Králové nad Labem is known for the Safari Park Dvůr Králové, one of the largest zoos in the country. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Dvůr Králové nad Labem consists of six municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Dvůr Králové nad Labem (13,475)
*Lipnice (393)
*Verdek (211)
*Zboží (165)
*Žireč (481)
*Žirecká Podstráň (225)
==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name means &quot;Queen&#x27;s court on the Elbe&quot;. It refers to its history, when it was owned by Bohemian queens, and geographical location. It was originally named Dvůr; the name appeared as &quot;Curia&quot; in Latin in 1270, as &quot;Hof&quot; in German in 1318, and then as &quot;Dwuor&quot; in Old Czech in 1421.

==Geography==
Dvůr Králové nad Labem is located about southwest of Trutnov and north of Hradec Králové. It lies mostly in the eastern tip of the Jičín Uplands; the northern part of the municipal territory extends into the Giant Mountains Foothills. The highest point is the hill Záleský vrch at above sea level. The town is situated on both banks of the Elbe River, in the river valley.

==History==

The first written mention of Dvůr Králové nad Labem is from 1270. A settlement with a small church was founded as guard point on a military trail to Silesia probably in the second half of the 12th century. The settlement began to expand with colonization of mostly German people. It is unknown when it was promoted to a town and became a property of the king.

In the 14th century, the town was fortified. In 1392, King Wenceslaus IV signed the town over to his wife, Queen Sophia of Bavaria. Since then, it was a dowry town and called Dvůr Králové. In 1421, the town surrendered without a fight to the moderate wing of the Hussites. In 1436, it became again a dowry town managed by Queen Barbara of Cilli.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Dvůr Králové was repeatedly looted and damaged, and experienced decline. It was also marked by War of the Austrian Succession, Seven Years&#x27; War and Austro-Prussian War. The town however recovered thanks to textile crafts (weaving and dyeing), and became regional centre of trade and crafts. The industry further developed after the railway was built in 1858, the road network was improved, and the Elbe became navigable. In the 1880s, the first textile factories were established.

Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, head of the &quot;Königshof an der Elbe – Dvůr Králové nad Labem&quot; District, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

After World War II, the German inhabitants were expelled.

===Manuscript affair===
On 16 September 1817, Václav Hanka allegedly discovered a manuscript appearing to be from the 13th century in the tower of a local church. The Manuscript of Dvůr Kralové, probably in fact created by Hanka, was intended to help Czech patriots in the struggle against German culture. Although it has been proved to be most likely a counterfeit, it became an important part of the country&#x27;s history.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The largest employer based in Dvůr Králové nad Labem is Juta. The company was founded here in 1946 as jute and hemp processor and followed up on tradition of textile industry. Today it focuses on technical fabrics and synthetic products.

==Transport==
Dvůr Králové nad Labem lies on the railway line Liberec–Pardubice.

==Sights==
The town is known for Safari Park Dvůr Králové with its African safari theme. Visitors may admire over 2,300 animals of 500 species of mostly African hoofstock. It has a reputation of one of the most successful breeders of many endangered species.

Notable is the Church of Saint John the Baptist, which is a national monument. it was built in the Gothic style on the site of the original Romanesque church. The tower was added in 1644 and its present appearance is from the reconstructions in the 1890s.

The historic core is formed by T. G. Masaryka Square. Its main landmark is the Renaissance Old Town Hall. It was built in 1833, after the original building from 1572 burned down in 1790. It has arcades and decorative façade. Other sights of the square include Art Nouveau savings bank from 1909–1910, Baroque marian column from 1754, and a fountain from 1857.

In the town part of Žireč there is an old residence of the Jesuits.

==Notable people==

*Ferdinand Albin Pax (1858–1942), botanist, acted in Germany
*Otto Gutfreund (1889–1927), Jewish sculptor
*Karl Freund (1890–1969), Jewish cameraman of the silent film era

<text>BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, sometimes abbreviated to BBC Yorks &amp; Lincs, is the name for the BBC&#x27;s twelfth English Region, based in Kingston upon Hull and created from the division of the former BBC North region, based in Leeds (now known as BBC Yorkshire). The primary transmitter is located at Belmont and covers East Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, north west Norfolk and eastern parts of Nottinghamshire.

==Services==
===Television===
The regional output of BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire consists of the flagship &quot;Look North&quot;, and the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire edition of &quot;Politics North&quot;, one of the regional successors to &quot;Sunday Politics&quot;. The region previously aired the &quot;Super League Show&quot;, produced by PDI Media at BBC Yorkshire&#x27;s studio in Leeds and simulcast in the North West and in the North East and Cumbria.

===Radio===
The region is the controlling centre for the local radio stations BBC Radio Humberside and BBC Radio Lincolnshire

Both radio stations simulcast some programming from each other, the radio stations in the BBC Yorkshire region, and with BBC Radio 5 Live.

===Online and Interactive===
&quot;BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire&quot; also produces regional news &amp; local radio pages for BBC Red Button and &quot;BBC Local News&quot; websites for each county.

==History==
Announced as part of the BBC&#x27;s &#x27;Project Hull&#x27; investment in October 2001, BBC Yorks and Lincs began as a seven-minute opt-out on the Belmont transmitter of the main &quot;Look North&quot; programme from Leeds, presented by Clare Frisby and the late bulletin following the Ten O&#x27;Clock News. On 11 November 2002, the &quot;Look North&quot; programme for the region launched as a full programme presented by Peter Levy and Helen Fospero. The programme expanded into new headquarters in April 2004, and the BBC Yorkshire and BBC Yorks and Lincs region became officially separate.

BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire&#x27;s first Head of Regional and Local Programmes (HRLP) was Helen Thomas, appointed in March 2004. In November 2006, Helen Thomas became HRLP of BBC Yorkshire in Leeds, and Catherine Hearne was appointed HRLP of BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. She took up her post in January 2007, but left to go to BBC West Midlands. The first Editor of Look North was Roger Farrant, whose departure to Bristol led to the appointment of Steven Punter as Editor in November 2004. Punter left the BBC soon after. Dave Betts ran Look North from 2006 until June 2007. Mark Hayman replaced him as the region&#x27;s first TV News Editor running an integrated team of journalists and technicians, but has since moved to BBC West Midlands.

==Studios==
The first studios used by BBC Yorks and Lincs housed the opt-out service, launched in 2001, which operated from a studio above the Post Office in 9 Chapel Street, Hull. The small studios and team were enough to produce an opt-out, but when the time came in November 2002 to launch their own programme, the studio was noticeable for its size. It was so small that there was room for the desk only; other features such as weather had to be done elsewhere and played out on a screen in the studio. 

Eventually, to coincide with the separation of the service, a new studio complex was built and unveiled by Manor Property Group at Queen&#x27;s Court in Queen&#x27;s Gardens in 2005. The new studio complex housed the new, expanded service, with a central newsroom, a good sized studio for the &quot;Look North&quot; programme, as well as radio studios for BBC Radio Humberside.

The region also has a news bureau in Lincoln.

<text>Nazeh Darwazi (also spelled Darwazeh; died 19 April 2003), was a Palestinian freelance cameraman for the US news agency Associated Press Television Network (APTN) and Palestinian state television when he was killed in Nablus in the West Bank while reporting by a bullet in the head fired by an Israeli soldier from a distance of about 20 yards (6.9 m) after having pointed his weapon at group of journalists.

Darwazi was one of five journalists to die while reporting on the Second Intifada between 2002 and 2003.

==Early life==
Nazeh Darwazi is believed to have been born between 1958 and 1961; various accounts of his age were reported. He was raised in Nablus, where he lived with his partner, Raeda, and their five children. His funeral was reported to have attracted over a thousand people. Darwazi worked for The Associated Press for two years. He was also a journalist for Palestinian television.

==Death==
Eighteen Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets and live fire during clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians throwing stones. Darwazi was filming fights between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the central Casbah district (Old City), when he was shot through the back of his head by an Israeli soldier positioned behind a tank 6.9m away. Tony Loughran (ZeroRisk International), Independent investigator for APTN, has edited previous information on Wikipedia which stated that Nazeh was shot through his right eye from the front, and validated this during the course of his investigation in April 2003. He was wearing a yellow jacket marked &quot;press&quot; and was with a group of around six journalists covering fights between the group of Palestinians and Israeli soldiers. The journalists said their group had shouted in English and Hebrew making clear that they were with the media. Three people filmed the event, including a Reuters cameraman. At first the army claimed they were under attack by armed Palestinians who had been throwing explosives, but witnesses claimed the soldier shot the journalist in cold blood without any exchange of fire.

==Investigation==
Reporters Without Borders investigated the event and found that the army had not interviewed eyewitnesses. The soldiers had been questioned, but nobody was punished. The Palestinian Authority stated that Israel had &quot;committed a war crime&quot; by &quot;opening fire on journalists and other civilians&quot;. ZeroRisk International &amp; The Associated Press said two Palestinian cameramen, Hassan Titi from Reuters and Sami al-Assi from a Palestinian station, confirmed that they saw soldier take aim and fire at the journalists. Video footage taken by Reuters confirms a soldier kneeling by a tank pointing a rifle down the alley where the journalists were wearing yellow &quot;Press&quot; vests. Darwazeh fell to his death shortly after the soldier fired.

The Israeli investigation said that Israeli soldiers had been shot at before returning fire when Darwazi was killed. The APTN / ZRI report categorically disputed such a claim and has evidence to prove that the Islraeli soldier shot Nazeh as he turned to his right to film Palestinian children being taken to an ambulance 

==Context==
Some of the journalists who were killed during the Second Intifada include Raffaele Ciriello, Italian; and Imad Abu Zahra and Issam Tillawi, who were both Palestinian. Two weeks after the Darwazi killing, James Miller was also killed on 2 May 2003 by the Israel Defense Forces while making a film about the Second Intifada.

Nazeh Darwazi was covering the Passover clashes in Nablus when he was killed. Israeli troops arrested several Palestinians in Nablus on suspicion of a planning a potential suicide attack during Passover. Three of the four were arrested around Casbah; the fourth turned himself in at a military checkpoint. In Rafah, five Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops during a raid of a nearby refugee camp in the southern Gaza strip. Twenty-seven people total were wounded in the raid. At the time, Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat was in a dispute with his handpicked prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, over the formation of a new government.

==Reaction==
On Monday 23 April 2003, in front of the International Red Cross headquarters in Al-Khalil district, a group of Palestinian journalists staged a sit-in to publicly declare their disgust with what happened. The Palestinian Authority accused the IDF of war crimes.

Reporters Without Borders, which is based in France, urged President Jacques Chirac to bring the issue of journalist security and safety up when he met with Israeli Moshe Katzav in 2004.

The Committee to Protect Journalists issued statement about Nazeh Darwazi&#x27;s death. Joel Simon, CPJ, said, &quot;We demand an immediate and thorough inquiry into the shooting death of Nazih Darwazeh and call on you to ensure that those responsible are swiftly brought to justice.&quot;

Nazeh Darwazi’s body was wrapped in the Palestinian flag and carried from the Rafidyeh hospital by representatives of the Palestinian press. Those carrying Darwazi chanted against Israel. They carried his body to the funeral, which was attended by more than 1,000 people.

<text>() or () or fardh in Islam is a religious duty commanded by God. The word is also used in Turkish, Persian, Pashto, Urdu, Hindi, Bangla (&quot;spelled farz or faraz&quot;), and Malay (&quot;spelled fardu or fardhu&quot;) in the same meaning. Muslims who obey such commands or duties are said to receive &quot;hasanat&quot; (), &quot;ajr&quot; () or &quot;thawab&quot; () for each good deed.

&quot;Fard&quot; or its synonym &quot;wājib&quot; () is one of the five types of ahkam () into which fiqh categorizes acts of every Muslim. The Hanafi fiqh, however, does not consider both terms to be synonymous, and makes a distinction between &quot;wajib&quot; and &quot;fard&quot;, the latter being obligatory and the former slightly lesser degree than being obligatory.

==Individual duty and sufficiency==
The Fiqh distinguishes two sorts of duties:

* Individual duty or &quot;farḍ al-&#x27;ayn&quot; () relates is required to perform, such as daily prayer (&quot;salat&quot;), and the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime if the person can afford the journey (&quot;hajj&quot;). An individual not performing this will be punished in the afterlife (but can be excused on basis of incapability), but if he enjoins and fulfils its necessity will be rewarded.
* Sufficiency duty or &quot;farḍ al-kifāya&quot; () is a duty which is imposed on the whole community of believers (&quot;ummah&quot;). The classic example for it is janaza (Funeral prayer): the individual is not required to perform it as long as a sufficient number of community members fulfill it.

== Examples of fard acts ==

# Salah (daily prayer, including Friday prayer)
# Zakat (giving alms)
# Sawm (fasting during Ramadan)
# Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca)
# Protecting one&#x27;s children

==See also==
* Dua
* Makruh
* Mustahabb

===Ahkam===
* Ahkam, commandments, of which fardh are a type
* Mustahabb, recommended but not required

===Other religions===
* Mitzvah, a somewhat similar Jewish concept
* Dharma. a somewhat similar Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh concept

<text>Capoeira music is the traditional musical accompaniment used in Afro-Brazilian art capoeira, featuring instruments like berimbau, pandeiro, atabaque, agogô, and reco-reco. The music plays a crucial role in capoeira &quot;roda&quot;, setting the style the energy of a game.

Music in the context of capoeira is used to create a sacred space through both the physical act of forming a circle (&quot;roda&quot;) and an aural space that is believed to connect to the spirit world. This deeper religious significance exists more as a social memory to most capoeira groups, but is generally understood as evidenced in the use of ngoma drums (the atabaques of candomblé), and the berimbau whose earlier forms were used in African rituals to speak with the ancestors.

== History ==

In early days, capoeira was accompanied only by the big drum (known as ngoma, conga or atabaque), hand-clapping and singing. Until the mid-nineteenth century, drums were a prominent musical instrument in capoeira. In the early to mid-nineteenth century Rio, capoeira was described by travelers as a war dance with drumbeats or hand clapping. In 1818, João Angola was arrested for possessing a small drum at a capoeira gathering. Playing a drum could lead to severe punishment, like on 5 December 1820, when Mathias Benguela, a slave, received 200 lashes for it. Despite punishment, drumming continued. An illustration from 1824 by Rugendas shows a participant in roda playing a drum. 

In 1833, the playing of African drums in Rio de Janeiro was prohibited by law. Due to the drum&#x27;s size, it couldn&#x27;t be concealed, leading to clandestine drumming in remote locations at night. To evade arrest, slaves used makeshift percussion instruments like clay or metal pieces, shells, and stones.

In 1859, French journalist Charles Ribeyrolls described the Afro-Brazilian dances on plantations in Rio de Janeiro province, linking the conga drum to capoeira, and the berimbau to batuque:

Gerhard Kubik, a 20th century music ethnologist, saw capoeira as a discipline where the drum not only accompanies but also guides and controls the players&#x27; actions. The berimbau belongs to the candomblé tradition. It was not used in capoeira until the 20th century, and first appeared as an instrument accompanying capoeira in the early 20th century in Bahia. The transition may have been influenced not only by musical preferences but also by the berimbau&#x27;s dual role as a weapon.

Mestre Pastinha formalized the inclusion of instruments into the capoeira Angola orchestra. He experimented with various instruments, occasionally incorporating guitars (&quot;viola de corda&quot;) and even introducing Spanish castanets into the roda at one point. The current standardized configuration of three berimbaus, two pandeiros, one agogô, one reco-reco, and one atabaque likely did not become established until the 1960s.

== Instruments ==

The standard instruments in nowadays capoeira are:
* up to 3 berimbaus
* up to 2 pandeiros
* 1 agogô
* 1 reco-reco (notched wooden tube similar to a guiro)
* 1 atabaque or conga

Not every roda will contain all these instruments. Mestre Bimba, for instance, preferred only one berimbau and two pandeiros in his rodas, but there will always be at least one berimbau in any roda.

The berimbaus preside over the roda, their rhythmic combinations suggesting variations in movement style between the two players in the roda. Some capoeira groups insist that among the three berimbaus, the lowest-toned (called a &quot;gunga&quot; or &quot;berraboi&quot;) is the lead instrument, while other groups follow the lead of the middle (&quot;medio&quot; or &quot;viola&quot;) berimbau. The roda begins and ends at the discretion of the lead berimbau player, who may determine who plays next, can stop games, set the tempo of the music, and calm the players if they get too rough. There appears to be agreement that the treble-most berimbau (&quot;viola&quot; or &quot;violinha&quot;) is an accompaniment instrument, freely improvising based on rhythms of the middle instrument.

== Songs in capoeira ==

In its traditional setting, there are three main styles of song that weave together the structure of the capoeira roda. 

Understanding songs in capoeira is a good way to grasp and put into some historical context early Brazilian life and history. If one can identify with the music on a personal level, it goes a long way in adopting the heritage vital in the maintenance of capoeira as a cultural force. The songs of capoeira partly play the role of cultural guide and teacher.

The songs, whether ladainha, corrido, or quadra, can be placed in many categories for comparison. The following list is not exhaustive
Many songs can be considered cross categorizational, as well.

=== Ladainha ===

The roda commences with the ladainha (litany), a solo often sung by the most senior member present, usually the one playing lead berimbau. These songs may be improvised on the spot, but are most often chosen from a canon of extant ladainhas. The ladainha varies in from as little as two lines, to 20 or more. Topics for this song type include moral lessons, stories, history, mythology, can be topical for a particular occasion as well as pure poetry, and almost always metaphorical. The song is loosely strophic and the melody is pretty much the same throughout the entire ladainha repertoire, with some variations here and there.
The ladainha uses quatrain form as a template, with the first line almost always repeated.

An interpretation of this song could be: Nothing comes easy without hard work.
The person who sings the ladainha cries out &quot;Ieeeeeeee&quot; (pronounced YaaaaaaaaY) to call to order the attendees of the roda, that the roda is starting. The ladainha ends with &quot;Camará&quot;, &quot;Camaradinho&quot; (fits better rhythmically), or conversely, &quot;É hora, hora&quot; (It&#x27;s the hour). This tagline marks the end of the ladainha and the beginning of the chula, or more properly louvação (praise).

=== Louvação ===
The louvação begins the call and response section of the roda. The &quot;louvação&quot; invokes God, Mestres, capoeira, and gives thanks. This section are also called &quot;chulas&quot; (Italicized line is the response).

The content of the louvação can be improvised as well, so having a good ear is critical to singing the chorus. The louvação, just as the ladainha, is strophic, but there is no variation in the melody from one louvação to another. However while it is most often sung in a major tonality, sometimes it can be heard in minor if the ladainha is also minor. The chorus is sung in unison, though an occasional harmonization, usually a third above, is sometimes used as a punctuation by one of the singers.

The two players/jogadores having sat at the pé-de-berimbau, or foot of the berimbau, during the ladainha, begin the game at the start of the corridos.

=== Corrido ===

The corridos are overlapping call and response typical of African singing, and influenced by, and borrowing from the Sambas de Roda of Bahia. Unlike the Mexican Corrido which is a form of folk ballad, the Bahian corrido is a short song with a usually static response. The chorus is often indicated by being used as the first line in the song:

The corrido communicates with the action in the roda (though without the level of interaction in a traditional samba de roda) to inspire the players, to comment directly on the action, invokes, praises, warns, tells stories, and teaches moral values. There is a corrido for welcoming the roda, for closing the roda, asking for the players to play less aggressively, more aggressively, to not grab the other person, and the list continues. Corridos can also be challenges (desafios). The lead will sing a corrido then after some time sing one very similar, requiring the chorus (everyone else save the two playing in the roda) to be paying close attention to sing the correct response or two singers can switch corridos on a certain subject. This use of the corrido in a roda is more rare, requiring a bit more expertise on the part of the singers than normal. The desafio/challenge can be used with ladainhas as well.
The corridos have the broadest melodic variation from one to the next, though many corridos share the same melodies. Thus a vast repertoire of corridos can be learned and improvisation within corridos becomes a less daunting prospect. Like the louvação, the corrido response is sung in unison, and like the louvação an occasional harmonization, usually a third above, is used as a punction by one of the singers.

=== Quadra ===
An innovation of Mestre Bimba, quadras take the place of the ladainha in some Regional and Contemporânea capoeira schools. They are four, eight, twelve (...) verse songs sung solo followed by the louvação. The main difference between the ladainha and quadra is that the quadra, like the corrido, doesn&#x27;t have a standard melodic model and exhibits a greater variety melody. Quadras also exist as a special type of corrido with four line solo verses followed by the choral response, such as the following:

Capenga ontem teve aqui&lt;br&gt;
Capenga ontem teve aqui&lt;br&gt;
Deu dois mil réis a papai&lt;br&gt;
Três mil réis a mamãe&lt;br&gt;

Café e açúcar a vovó&lt;br&gt;
Deu dois vintém a mim&lt;br&gt;
Sim senhor, meu camará&lt;br&gt;
Quando eu entrar, você entra&lt;br&gt;
Quando eu sair, você sai&lt;br&gt;

Passar bem, passar mal&lt;br&gt;
Mas tudo no mundo é passar&lt;br&gt;
Ha ha ha&lt;br&gt;
Água de beber

=== Chula ===

The term chula is often given to the call and response louvação immediately following the ladainha. By comparison, traditionally in Bahia the chula is the free form song text of the Samba de Roda sung between the dances (as in the samba parada) and defines the structures of the various other &quot;styles&quot; of samba de roda, while the samba corrido lasts as long as the singer feels like singing it before moving on to another. The chula is a poetic form based on the quadra (quatrain) form (which may have influenced Mestre Bimba&#x27;s replacement of ladainhas with quadras) with its roots in Iberia. The word chula comes from the word chulo meaning &quot;vulgar&quot;, common, rustic (similarly the Spanish word chulo/chulito is used for peasant Indians in the Americas), being often pastoral and sentimental.

How the term chula came to refer to the louvação isn&#x27;t currently known. But its similarity to the ladainha and the use of corrido songs from the samba de roda tradition probably played a large role.

==Melody and Rhythm==

The melodies range from a fifth above (sometimes up to a sixth) and a third below the tonic: A (B) C D E (F) G (A), where C is tonic, the leading tone (B), fourth (f) and the sixth (A) are generally avoided. See Degree (music). The ladainha may include the fourth below the tonic at the cadence as a tagline with &quot;camaradinho&quot; to signal the beginning of the louvação. Rather than a tonic-dominant relationship, the ladainhas exhibit a tonic-supertonic progression (incidentally bossa nova exhibits a similar tendency for unrelated reasons) where harmonic tension is always on the 2nd scale degree, D in the key of C.

*NB. The berimbaus have a harmonic potential, but are not necessarily tuned to the singers&#x27; voices. If they are, then it will be generally the high note of the gunga as that is where the ladainha begins and as such doesn&#x27;t create a dissonant 2nd interval between the two. That&#x27;s not a strict rule in that many examples can be found where the singer tunes his or her voice to the low note instead. This has the effect of categorizing the music as mixolydian, a common feature of Brazilian music in the Northeast of Brazil. Whether or not one hears it in mixolydian or major is debatable. The beginning yell of &quot;Iê&quot; is commonly a fifth above the tonic and this sets the key.

Rhythmically, the music is in 4/4 time, common for music in the Angolan region of Africa, where the rhythms of both Brazilian samba and Cuban guaguancó have their origins. The singing is in Portuguese with some Kikongo and Yoruba words and phrases. The lyrics align themselves with the rhythm of the music, sometimes coming in on the strong beats, sometimes on the weak beats and pickups, depending on the vagaries of the song. It is theorized that the rhythms of capoeira are indeed from Angola, however, the introduction of the berimbau to capoeira was relatively recent (at least since the late 19th century) and the original songs, instrumentation, and rhythms are now lost. Capoeira in its earlier form was accompanied by omar in kikongo, hand clapping, and percussion accompaniment on a transverse hand drum. Since then, a number of instruments, including whistles, castanets, and violas (small Brazilian guitars), and likely any instrument available, have been used into the early 20th century.

The berimbau itself has been a folk instrument for solo song accompaniment and worship and became a mainstay of the roda when metal wire was widely available for use as a string. Before then, berimbaus were strung with plant fibers and thus could not project as loudly as with metal (nowadays, the wire is culled from used car and bicycle tires). Brass wire was observed being used on berimbaus, though, as early as 1824 in Rio. The caxixi&#x27;s inclusion with the berimbau is another recent innovation that gives the berimbau an extra bit of punch. A theory goes that berimbaus were fitted with metal blades at the top which made them a defensive weapon when playing capoeira openly (which was essentially outlawed until the 1930s) was a dangerous affair.

===Minor Tonality Ladainhas===
The minor tonality ladainhas are rarer but have precedence. Mestre Traira demonstrates their use in his CD, Mestre Traira: Capoeira da Bahia. He uses a minor pentatonic scale:
:(G) A C D E G (tonic at A)
This produces an interesting variation on the more common Ladainha melody. The Louvação is in the same pentatonic with the correspónding corridos reworked in the pentatonic as well.

===Syncopation===

Unlike the majority of Brazilian music, the syncopation in this music is a bit more subtle, relying on the interplay between the rhythm of the lyrics and the weak and strong beats of the isorhythmic cells played by the instruments, shifting the feeling of the downbeat from corrido to corrido, and interlocking/overlapping call and response driving the music forward. Below are two musical bars separated by the bar line |. The downbeats are defined as 1 and 3, the upbeats as 2 and 4, and the anticipation, or pick up, lies between 4 and 1.
:1.2.3.4.|1.2.3.4.
The Angola and São Bento Pequeno rhythms for which capoeira Angola is known for, create a syncopation through silence on 3, and stressing 4 with two short buzzed notes (see berimbau). The São Bento Grande rhythm stresses both downbeats on the berimbaus which has the effect of a driving march (played in a quick double time tempo).
The atabaque serves as the heart beat of the music, providing a steady pulse on 1 and 3 with open tones, often with an anticipation to 1, and a muted bass on 2.:
&lt;br&gt;
:O.B.O..O|O.B.O..O, O = open tone, B = bass.
The agogô, a double bell tuned to an open fourth or fifth, plays:
:L.H.L...|L.H.L..., L = low bell strike, H = high
Reco-reco, likewise
:X.X.X...|X.X.X..., X = scrape
The pandeiro, has a bit more freedom than the other instruments
:O.S.O.xx|O.S.O.xx, O = open tone, S = slap, xx = shake.
Another version provides
:O.S.Otpt|O.S.Otpt, where t = strike with ring, middle, and index finger near the rim, and p = palm
The final t can be replaced with an open tone using the middle finger a little further away from the rim.
The effect of the supporting instruments together, is to build tension from an anticipation just before 1 (the third open note played by the atabaque) to 2, and resolution on 3, which then pushes the cell forward with the anticipation at the pick up to 1. As the berimbaus play with and against this framework along with the song verses, a surprising amount of syncopation results, despite the simple nature of the patterns.
There is very little room allowed for improvisation in these supporting instruments. To allow otherwise would tend to distract too much from the content of the songs and the action inside the roda, as well as compete for attention with the berimbaus. There is still room, however, for occasional variations on the basic rhythms by the supporting instruments, especially when the overall energy of the roda is fairly high.

The berimbau toques follow the pattern of the supporting instruments, but with a broad arena for improvising. The above on syncopation also follows with the berimbau. In the case of the Angola toque (the half notes below in this case represent unmuted quarter notes):
The silence at 3 gives a lilt to the feeling of resolution, while the São Bento Grande toque

contrasts with a greater sense of finality at 3.

The viola berimbau, the highest pitched of the three, adds a layer of rhythmic improvisation, similar to the role of the quinto (drum) in Cuban rumba, though without the layer of rhythmic possibilities allowed for in rumba (which uses at least nine subdivisions of the bar). The following illustrates the possible subdivisions for improvisation in capoeira music in a single four beat bar:

:0_______0_______0_______ 1/2 time triplets
:0_____0_____0_____0_____ Melodic Pace (0 represents 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively)
:0___0___0___0___0___0___ Triplets
:0__0__0__0__0__0__0__0__ Basic subdivision
:0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_ Double time triplets (used in calls by the Gunga, tempo permitting)

*&quot;N.B.&quot; The performance of the supporting instruments, and indeed the berimbaus and songs themselves can and have changed over the years, becoming highly codified, while exact performance standards can still vary from group to group. Mario de Andrade&#x27;s &quot;Missão de Pesquisas Folcóricas&quot; recorded in 1938 show an interpretation of the music that is slightly different, with two atabaques with a more active role in one example. For better or for worse, one is not likely to see two atabaques in one roda.

== Importance of music ==
The Bantu peoples, among whom capoeira originated, believe that music can communicate between the various spheres and penetrate to the other world. In the Congo, big conga drum, known as ngoma, is of great importance. They transmitted messages to warriors, in a language that was familiar to them.

Mestre Pastinha always emphasized the role of music and singing in capoeira game:

In today&#x27;s capoeira outside Brazil, students who aren&#x27;t proficient in Portuguese encounter challenges in singing and comprehending the lyrics. Their unfamiliarity with Afro-Brazilian rhythms makes it more difficult for them to seamlessly integrate capoeira toques into their &quot;ginga&quot;. Consequently, novice and even intermediate students may be hesitant to engage in singing and playing instruments, instead favoring flashy movements. This, in turn, perpetuates the disconnection between music and movements, resulting in a less rhythmic &quot;ginga&quot; that capoeira instructors struggle so hard to improve.

<text>Greenford is a London Underground and National Rail station in Greenford, Greater London, and is owned and managed by London Underground. It is the terminus of the National Rail Greenford branch line, down the line from and measured from . On the Central line, it is between Perivale and Northolt stations while on National Rail, the next station to the south on the branch is .

Greenford station is in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==
The original Greenford station was opened by the Great Western Railway on 1 October 1904 on the joint &quot;New North Main Line&quot; (present-day Acton–Northolt line).

The present station, adjacent to the original, was designed by Brian Lewis and built in the Central line extension of the 1935-40 New Works Programme of the London Passenger Transport Board. It was completed by Frederick Francis Charles Curtis and opened on 30 June 1947 after delay due to World War II. Service at the original (&quot;main-line&quot;) station was gradually reduced and it was closed in 1963. Operational responsibility for the station transferred from British Rail to London Transport with effect from 13 November 1967.

The site of the old station for the New North Main Line can still be seen from inside Central line trains.

==The station today==
Greenford station is above ground level with an island platform for the Central line. A bay platform facing south-east between the Underground platforms serves the Greenford branch service operated by Great Western Railway. The branch line then continues south and joins the Great Western Main Line at .

Platform 1 is for westbound Central line trains, and platform 3 for eastbound trains. The access to the platform via escalators takes passengers to the front of the train for westbound service, and the rear for eastbound service.
Greenford was the first London Underground station to have an escalator up to platforms above street level. Until 2014 it remained the final London Underground station with a wooden-treaded escalator in service; all other such escalators were previously converted to fully metal treads, or removed altogether from sub-surface Underground stations in the wake of the fatal 1987 King&#x27;s Cross fire.

In addition to the shuttle train, the line between Greenford and West Ealing carries freight services including containerised domestic waste from near Brentford, sand and gravel traffic as well as occasional special passenger services and a daily Chiltern Railways &quot;parliamentary ghost train&quot; from West Ruislip to West Ealing that returns non-stop to High Wycombe.

In 2009, because of financial constraints, TfL decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Greenford and five other stations, on the grounds that these were relatively quiet stations and some were already one or two stops away from an existing step-free station. £3.9 million was spent on Greenford before the project was halted. The step-free access project, consisting of a glass incline lift, was later restarted, opening on 20 October 2015.

==Services==
===London Underground===
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*9 tph westbound to West Ruislip
*3 tph westbound to Northolt
*9 tph eastbound to Epping
*3 tph eastbound to Loughton

===National Rail===

Great Western Railway operates a shuttle service to West Ealing every 30 minutes except on Sundays. Services call at , , and and the journey time is just over 10 minutes. The final service of the day runs through to London Paddington, as well as the first terminating service. Until January 2017, all services used to run to and from , however, after the construction of a new bay platform at West Ealing and the introduction of Elizabeth line services from London Paddington to , it was then reduced to a shuttle running to and from West Ealing.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 92, 105, 395 and E6 serve the station.

<doc id="1144559" wikidata="Q3751769" url="?curid=1144559" title="Cosme Damián Churruca">
<text>Cosme Damián de Churruca y Elorza (27 September 1761 – 21 October 1805) was a Spanish Navy officer, nobleman and politician. During the Battle of Trafalgar, he was the commander of the ship of the line &quot;San Juan Nepomuceno&quot; which he defended to his death.

== Biography == 
Churruca was born in Mutriku, he was the fourth son of Francisco de Churruca, mayor of the town. He received his early years education in the Seminary of Burgos, initially thinking of becoming a priest. Then, he entered the School of Bergara where he would become member of Royal Basque Society of Friends of the Country until his death. After finishing his studies, inspired by the adventures of his relative José Antonio de Gaztañeta, he joined the Naval Academy of Cadiz in 1776, and got his degree in the Naval Academy of Ferrol in 1778, becoming a naval officer.

In 1781, Churruca, as an officer of the Spanish Navy, performed heroically in a siege of Gibraltar under the command of Ignacio María de Álava, earning a distinguished reputation for his services. In 1805, just a few months before his death, Churruca married María Dolores Ruiz de Apodaca, niece of Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, naval officer and viceroy of New Spain.

== Battle of Trafalgar ==

The squadron to which the San Juan was assigned sailed on 13 August from the port of Ferrol. General Gravina had given Churruca a place of honour, the head of the vanguard. Churruca completed his mission with the highest merit and upon his arrival to Cadiz, redoubled his efforts in training his recently recruited and inexperienced civilian crew.
It was at this time he married Maria de los Dolores Ruiz de Apodaca, daughter of Brigadier don Vicente, and cousin of the duke of Venadito.

With the Spanish and French squadrons reunited in the port of Cadiz, they sailed on a course to Marticina, where they took the fort of Del Diamante and captured a British convoy consisting of 16 merchant ships; in these moments Villeneuve, the chief of the combined fleet, was informed of the presence of Nelson in the Antillas. Villeneuve now decided he had completed his objective, which was to draw British naval forces to the other shore of the Atlantic, so he decided to sail the combined fleet back to Ferrol.
However, in the cape of Finisterre, he bumped into the squadron of Admiral Calder, where a battle ensued. The majority of the French squadron continued to Ferrol, while the remaining ships were left to fend for themselves. Their defeat is attributed to the indecision and poor command of the chief of the combined squadron, Villeneuve, by Napoleon, who upon reading reports of the battle said: &quot;The Spanish have behaved like lions, while their admiral only offered curses.&quot;

The combined fleet entered Ferrol after the battle, proceeding in continuation to La Coruña. From this port, Villeneuve set a course to Cadiz, ignoring Napoleon&#x27;s order to go to Brest. Once there, despite the protests and opposing opinions of Churruca, Gravina and Alcalá-Galiano, Villeneuve abandoned the Bay of Cádiz to reach Nelson at the Cape of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. Before sailing on 20 October, Churruca wrote to his brother:


21 October dawned, and in sight of the British fleet Churruca ordered the colours to be nailed to the mast, and ordered that they should not be taken down while he still lived. Under the command of Churruca, the San Juan Nepomuceno demonstrated military precision, daring and efficiency, despite finding itself alone against six English ships, including HMS &quot;Defiance&quot;, HMS &quot;Tonnant&quot;, HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. After being reached by a cannonball which tore his leg, Churruca died with the admiration of his enemies, who displayed his vessel in Gibraltar to visitors with his name written in golden letters above the cabin, and advising those who would enter to remove their covers, as if don Cosme Damián de Churruca y Elorza was still present. His officers kept their word, and only lowered the colours after his death. Unable to break the circle of fire and in order to prevent the vessel sinking with all the wounded trapped below, the &quot;San Juan&quot; surrendered with over 100 dead and 150 wounded on board.

==Legacy==
Churruca was posthumously promoted to admiral, and in his memory his cousin received the title Count of Churruca. The events to which Churruca was a protagonist, were novelised in 1872 by Benito Pérez Galdós, in Trafalgar, the first title of his Episodios Nacionales.

A statue in his memory stands in his native Mutriku, as well as Ferrol, where a simple monument records his death by the Academy. In San Fernando there is a stone in the third pulpit of the Panteon de Marinos Ilustres (Pantheon of Illustrious Sailors) which reads:

After Trafalgar, the ship was taken to Gibraltar and entered British service, initially as , before her Spanish name was restored. In honour of Churruca&#x27;s courage, his cabin bore his name on a brass plate, and all who entered were required to remove their hat as a mark of respect for a gallant enemy. HMS &quot;San Juan&quot; served as a supply hulk in Gibraltar until 1815, when she was broken up. 
In the 1942 Spanish film &quot;Raza&quot;, based on a semi-autobiographical script by then head of state Francisco Franco, the main characters are a family descending from Churruca.

In 1976 Spain issued a 7pta postage stamp portraying Churruca to honor him.

It was where Julie Andrews sang &quot;The Hills Are Alive&quot; at the opening scene and where the family climbed the mountain on their escape to Switzerland at the end of the film.

The mountain also lends its name to an 1829 opera, &quot;Der Untersberg,&quot; by Johann Nepomuk von Poißl (1783–1865).

==Geography==
The Untersberg rises at the rim of the Northern Limestone Alps, immediately at the Salzburg Basin and the broad Salzach Valley. Neighbouring peaks are the Hoher Göll in the southeast and Mt. Watzmann in the south, beyond the Berchtesgaden Basin. In the northwest, the Saalach Valley with Bad Reichenhall separates it from the Hochstaufen massif of the Chiemgau Alps. About two-thirds of the area, including the Berchtesgaden Hochthron peak, is located in Germany, while the northernmost steep edge above Salzburg belongs to Austria.

The mountain is a landmark popular with tourists, due to its proximity to the City of Salzburg: less than south of the city centre and within easy reach, e.g. by bus lines running to the southern suburbs of Grödig and Großgmain. 

Several trails lead to the top, though most people prefer the &quot;Untersbergbahn&quot; cable car. Constructed over a period of over two years, and opening in April 1961, the eight and a half minute journey lifts passengers from the lower terminus at the village of Sankt Leonhard at over to the top station on the Geiereck spur at an altitude of , transporting them a horizontal distance of almost with a maximum height above the ground of .

The first recorded ascent was in the first half of the 12th century, by Eberwein, a member of the Augustinian monastery at Berchtesgaden.

==Geology==
The Untersberg massif is mainly made up of limestone. Within it, the Upper Cretaceous Gosau Group is the source of a pale cream, rose to gray yellow, massive and very dense limestone known as the &quot;Untersberg Marble&quot;. This building stone is a fine to medium grained (partially breccious) arenite that forms the facade of notable buildings such as Salzburg Cathedral.

The Karst topography of the limestone includes numerous caves. So far, more than 400 have been explored—including the Schellenberg ice cave at an elevation of , a show cave since 1925, and the Kolowrat cave with a high dome. The Riesending cave with a depth of and a length of is the largest known in Germany. There also is a lake at depth. An expedition in August 2008 revealed that its lowest point had not yet been reached.

==Legend==

First mentioned as &quot;Vndarnsperch&quot; (&quot;Noon Mountain&quot;) in a 1306 deed issued by the Salzburg archbishops, the prominent spur has been the subject of numerous myths and legends. According to a popular king asleep in mountain legend, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa shall remain asleep inside Mt. Untersberg until his resurrection. His beard is said to be growing longer and longer around a round table and to have grown round two times. Myth says that when the beard has grown three times around the table the end of the world has come. When Frederick leaves the mountain, there will be no further Holy Roman Emperor and the last great battle of humankind will be fought at the pear tree on the Walserfeld, a pasture near Wals, west of Salzburg. There is a similar legend for the Kyffhäuser Mountain in Thuringia and Trifels Castle.

Other legends say that it is Charlemagne waiting inside the Untersberg, taken care of by the &quot;Untersberger Mandln&quot;, small dwarf-like creatures. Every hundred years he awakes and when he sees the ravens (actually choughs) still flying around the Untersberg he sleeps for another century. Indeed, Charlemagne had held a synod in Salzburg in 803 AD, where he met with Bishop Arno. The Alpine tradition of the Untersberg Wild Hunt (&quot;Perchten&quot;) has recently been revived. There are also several legends about the cave system below the mountain.

==Marble ball mills==

The Untersberger marble ball mills are located in Marktschellenberg in Berchtesgaden, at the opening of the Almbachklamm valley.

The &quot;Kugelmühlen&quot; (ball mills) were established in 1683. Once popular children&#x27;s toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921.

As late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction.

The ball mills were driven by the waters of the Almbach river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After coarse grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.

<text>John Lane (14 March 1854 – 2 February 1925) was a British publisher who co-founded The Bodley Head with Charles Elkin Mathews.

==Career==
John Lane was born into a farming family in West Putford, Devon on 14 March 1854. He moved to London in his teens. While working as a clerk at the Railway Clearing House, he acquired knowledge as an autodidact.

After entering the London book trade, in 1887 he became co-founder with Elkin Mathews of The Bodley Head which originally was a bookshop dealing in antiquarian books. In 1894, still operating under the name of The Bodley Head, they began to publish books. Mathews left shortly afterwards and began to publish on his own as Elkin Mathews Ltd. and &quot;returned to a great concentration on bookselling&quot;.

Lane continued to publish as The Bodley Head and under the name John Lane. He is mainly associated with publishing controversial and audacious texts, especially for a small, sophisticated audience. Examples are the periodical &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; (1894–1897) and Lane&#x27;s Keynotes Series, which included contentious material such as Grant Allen&#x27;s novel &quot;The Woman Who Did&quot; (1895), Victoria Crosse&#x27;s immediate reaction to it, the novel &quot;The Woman Who Didn&#x27;t&quot; (1895), and H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel about his affair with Amber Reeves, &quot;The New Machiavelli&quot; (1911).

==Personal life==
On 13 August 1898, John Lane married Annie Philippine King, the widow of Tyler Batcheller King and the daughter of Julius Eichberg. Annie Lane was author of &quot;To Thee, O Country&quot; (national hymn) and of the books &quot;Brown&#x27;s Retreat&quot;, &quot;Kitwyk&quot; (published by John Lane in 1903), &quot;The Champagne Standard&quot;, &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; and &quot;According to Maria&quot;.

His nephews, Allen, Richard and John Lane, founded Penguin Books.

John Lane died at his London home, 8 Lancaster Gate Terrace, Bayswater, on 2 February 1925, during a bout of influenza. He was cremated at Golders Green, and his ashes were interred at St Nectan&#x27;s Church in the hamlet of Stoke, near Hartland, Devon. In the St Nectan&#x27;s churchyard, there is a stone seat commemorating various members of the Lane family.

<doc id="1144572" wikidata="Q5183833" url="?curid=1144572" title="Creed, Cornwall">
<text>Creed () is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Grampound with Creed, in the Cornwall district, in mid Cornwall, England. It is roughly midway between Truro and St Austell, about two miles (3 km) east of Probus. In 1961 the parish had a population of 203. On 1 April 1983 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Grampound with Creed&quot;, part also went to St. Mewan.

The name comes from Saint Cride (&quot;Sancta Crida&quot;), the patron of the church.

The manor of Tybesta was the head manor of the hundred of Powder in the time of Domesday and later one of the 17 Antiqua maneria of the Duchy of Cornwall. It included the whole of the parish of Creed and parts of other parishes.

==Parish Church==
The church of St Crida was of Norman foundation but in its existing form is more or less of the 15th century (the tower which had already been built in 1447 however was rebuilt in 1734). Between 1869 and 1906 the church was unused. It has a tower of three stages, a fine south aisle and a south porch. Parts of the old woodwork have been preserved. By 1291 the church was cruciform; of this the north transept and some masonry in the north wall remain. In the mid 15th century the south transept was replaced by an ambitious south aisle, with lavish windows, and an unusually rich south porch. Features of interest include the 15th century wagon roof of the south aisle, a Norman pillar piscina, the 13th century Catacleuse stone font, and the chest tomb of Thomas and Margaret Denys (died 1589 &amp; 1578).

The church is covered in natural Cornish slating on the north and south slopes of the roof, with a ridge on the north chapel and south aisle. The south porch is provided with a hog&#x27;s back unglazed natural clay ridge tile. The roof has no Coping stone or Cross finials. The roof of the tower is unusually formed of Copper sheeting welted with a fleet to the gully on the north side of the tower. The tower is decorated with carved crotcheted granite pinnacles.
William Gregor, the discoverer of titanium, was rector here. Dr. Reginald Merther-derwa was Rector 1423-47; his will provided for the erection of a series of stone crosses at Camborne. The five similar stone crosses in Creed parish, including one now at Grampound church, may also have been due to him. Merther-derwa&#x27;s will says &quot;New stone crosses to be put up of the usual kind in those parts of Cornwall from Kayar Reslasek to Camborne church where dead bodies are rested on the way to their burial, that prayers may be made and the bearers take some rest&quot;. As there are no Gothic stone crosses in Camborne or adjacent parishes it is likely that these crosses were set up at Creed instead. In Creed parish there are the remains of four 15th-century crosses, three of which were cut from Pentewan stone. The market cross of Grampound is more ornate than the other three crosses. Fair Cross is a Gothic cross shaft. Nancor Cross has a cross head which was found in the 1920s near Nancor Farm; it was later set on a new shaft and erected beside the A390 road. In 1995 it was broken into four pieces but repaired in 1996. The fourth cross consists only of a cross base at Creed Lane.

<text>John Grimes Walker (March 20, 1835 – September 16, 1907) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served during the Civil War. After the war, he served as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, head of the Lighthouse Board, and commander-in-chief of the Squadron of Evolution and of the North Atlantic Squadron. In retirement, he led commissions to investigate the construction of a Central American canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

==Early life and career==
Walker was born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire to Alden and Susan (Grimes) Walker. His parents moved to Iowa and Walker spent much of his youth there. His uncle, James W. Grimes, served as Governor of Iowa and represented the state in the United States Senate.

Walker was appointed a midshipman on October 5, 1850, and graduated at the head of his class at the Naval Academy in 1856. His training at sea was aboard in the Pacific Squadron. After graduation, he served in and in 1858 and 1859; in in 1860 and 1861; in in 1861; and in in 1861 and 1862.

==Civil War service==
Walker distinguished himself under David Dixon Porter during the Mississippi River campaigns while serving in &quot;Winona&quot;, (which he commanded), and . He participated in the engagements with Forts Jackson and St. Philip, as well as the Chalmette batteries during the operations which resulted in the fall of New Orleans.

He later took part in the Navy&#x27;s operations against Vicksburg. During the winter of 1862 and 1863, Walker participated in the thrusts against Haines Bluff and Arkansas Post. He also took part in the Yazoo Pass Expedition, the attack on Fort Pemberton, and the capture of Yazoo City.

At the siege of Vicksburg, Walker commanded the naval gun battery attached to the 15th Army Corps. His subsequent war service included operations which resulted in the capture of Fort Fisher, and he participated in the ensuing bombardments of Forts Anderson and Caswell on the Cape Fear River and in the capture of Wilmington, North Carolina. From 1864 to 1865, he commanded the steam gunboat in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
==Post-Civil War service==
From 1865 to 1866, Walker commanded the steamer in the Brazil Squadron. Promoted to commander in July 1866, he served as Assistant Superintendent of the Naval Academy from 1866 to 1869. After commanding in 1869 and 1870—during which time he took the ship to Europe on a midshipman training cruise—Walker served as secretary to the Lighthouse Board from 1873 to 1878. Promoted to captain in June 1877, he commanded the sidewheel steam frigate on North Atlantic Station in 1881.

From 1881 to 1889, Walker held the post of Chief of the Bureau of Navigation. Created in 1882, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), directed its reports to the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation until 1889 when it was seconded to the assistant secretary of the navy&#x27;s office.

Walker was the subject of a feature article in the September 12, 1891 edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The article detailed how, as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, Walker gave senior officers assignments beneath their abilities in hopes that they would retire from the Navy sooner and, thereby, enable Walker to get promoted faster.

==Flag assignments==
Promoted to commodore in February 1889, Walker went to sea as an acting rear admiral commanding the Squadron of Evolution (or &quot;White Squadron&quot;), with his flag in . In 1890, he assumed command of the South Atlantic Squadron. From September 1892 to June 1893, Walker served as commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic Squadron. From 1893 to 1894, he was a member of the Board of Inspection and Survey.

Appointed permanent rear admiral in January 1894, Walker briefly served as commander of the Pacific Squadron from April to August 1894. In 1895, he took the White Squadron to Hawaii when a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; posed a threat to American interests. He received a commendation for his attitude of watchful waiting and his squadron&#x27;s posture of readiness to respond to a possible emergency.

Upon his return to shore duty in 1896, he headed the Lighthouse Board and concurrently chaired the committee investigating locations for deep-water harbors in southern California.

==Post-Navy activities==
In 1866, Walker married Rebecca White Pickering, daughter of Henry White Pickering of Boston and Salem, Massachusetts. They had seven children, including Susan Walker Fitzgerald.

Soon after retiring as a rear admiral in 1897, Walker was chosen to serve as President of the Nicaragua Canal Commission. Two years later, in 1899, he was appointed President of the congressional Isthmian Canal Commission to look into possible routes for a canal across the Central American isthmus.

Admiral Walker was a veteran companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Naval Order of the United States. He was also a hereditary companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

Rear Admiral Walker died at the age of 72, at Ogunquit, Maine. His remains were cremated and then interred at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors on September 21, 1907.

==Namesakes==
Two destroyers have been named in his honor.

<text>Egton House in Langham Street in Central London was home to BBC Radio 1 from 1985 until 1996 and BBC Radio 3 for a period. 
Radio 1 moved to Yalding House on Great Portland Street in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for the Egton Wing of BBC Broadcasting House, later renamed the John Peel Wing. Jo Whiley was the last presenter to broadcast from Egton House (12pm-2pm on Wednesday 9 October 1996).

Egton House was also home to the BBC Gramophone Library, a collection of over one million records and CDs. The 78 rpm collection was held in the basement of The Langham which is across the road in Langham Place and has now reverted to being a luxury hotel.
Egton House was linked to Broadcasting House by an underground tunnel which was often used to smuggle celebrities such as David Cassidy and The Osmonds into the main building avoiding waiting fans.

<doc id="1144596" wikidata="Q411848" url="?curid=1144596" title="Lead(II) chloride">
<text>Lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) is an inorganic compound which is a white solid under ambient conditions. It is poorly soluble in water. Lead(II) chloride is one of the most important lead-based reagents. It also occurs naturally in the form of the mineral cotunnite.

==Structure and properties==
In solid PbCl2, each lead ion is coordinated by nine chloride ions in a tricapped triangular prism formation — six lie at the vertices of a triangular prism and three lie beyond the centers of each rectangular prism face. The 9 chloride ions are not equidistant from the central lead atom, 7 lie at 280–309 pm and 2 at 370 pm. PbCl2 forms white orthorhombic needles.

In the gas phase, PbCl2 molecules have a bent structure with the Cl–Pb–Cl angle being 98° and each Pb–-Cl bond distance being 2.44 Å. Such PbCl2 is emitted from internal combustion engines that use ethylene chloride-tetraethyllead additives for antiknock purposes.

PbCl2 is sparingly soluble in water, solubility product &quot;K&quot;sp = at 20 °C. It is one of only 5 commonly water-insoluble chlorides, the other 4 being thallium(I) chloride, silver chloride (AgCl) with &quot;K&quot;sp = , copper(I) chloride (CuCl) with &quot;K&quot;sp = and mercury(I) chloride (Hg2Cl2) with &quot;K&quot;sp = .

==Synthesis==

Solid lead(II) chloride precipitates upon addition of aqueous chloride sources (HCl, NaCl, KCl) to aqueous solutions of lead(II) compounds, such as lead(II) nitrate and lead(II) acetate:
It also forms by treatment of basic lead(II) compounds such as Lead(II) oxide and lead(II) carbonate.

Lead dioxide is reduced by chloride as follows:

It also formed by the oxidation of lead metal by copper(II) chloride:
Or most straightforwardly by the action of chlorine gas on lead metal:

==Reactions==
Addition of chloride ions to a suspension of PbCl2 gives rise to soluble complex ions. In these reactions the additional chloride (or other ligands) break up the chloride bridges that comprise the polymeric framework of solid PbCl2(s).
:PbCl2(s) + Cl− → [PbCl3]−(aq)
:PbCl2(s) + 2 Cl− → [PbCl4]2−(aq)

PbCl2 reacts with molten NaNO2 to give PbO:
:PbCl2(l) + 3 NaNO2 → PbO + NaNO3 + 2 NO + 2 NaCl

PbCl2 is used in synthesis of lead(IV) chloride (PbCl4): Cl2 is bubbled through a saturated solution of PbCl2 in aqueous NH4Cl forming [NH4]2[PbCl6]. The latter is reacted with cold concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) forming PbCl4 as an oil.

Lead(II) chloride is the main for organometallic derivatives of lead, such as plumbocenes. The usual alkylating agents are employed, including Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds:
:2 PbCl2 + 4 RLi → R4Pb + 4 LiCl + Pb
:2 PbCl2 + 4 RMgBr → R4Pb + Pb + 4 MgBrCl
:3 PbCl2 + 6 RMgBr → R3Pb-PbR3 + Pb + 6 MgBrCl

These reactions produce derivatives that are more similar to organosilicon compounds, &quot;i.e.&quot; that Pb(II) tends to disproportionate upon alkylation.

PbCl2 can be used to produce PbO2 by treating it with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), forming a reddish-brown precipitate of PbO2.

==Uses==
*Molten PbCl2 is used in the synthesis of lead titanate and barium lead titanate ceramics by cation replacement reactions:
*:&quot;x&quot; PbCl2(l) + BaTiO3(s) → Ba1−&quot;x&quot;Pb&quot;x&quot;TiO3 + &quot;x&quot; BaCl2
*PbCl2 is used in production of infrared transmitting glass, and ornamental glass called aurene glass. Aurene glass has an iridescent surface formed by spraying with PbCl2 and reheating under controlled conditions. Stannous chloride (SnCl2) is used for the same purpose.
*Pb is used in HCl service even though the PbCl2 formed is slightly soluble in HCl. Addition of 6–25% of antimony (Sb) increases corrosion resistance.
*A basic chloride of lead, PbCl2·Pb(OH)2, is known as Pattinson&#x27;s white lead and is used as pigment in white paint. Lead paint is now banned as a health hazard in many countries by the White Lead (Painting) Convention, 1921.
*PbCl2 is an intermediate in refining bismuth (Bi) ore. The ore containing Bi, Pb, and Zn is first treated with molten caustic soda to remove traces of arsenic and tellurium. This is followed by the Parkes process to remove any silver and gold present. There are now Bi, Pb, and Zn in the ore. At 500 °C, it receives treatment from Cl2 gas. First, ZnCl2 forms and is excreted. Pure Bi is left behind after PbCl2 forms and is eliminated. Lastly, BiCl3 would form.

==Toxicity==
Like other soluble lead compounds, exposure to PbCl2 may cause lead poisoning.

<doc id="1144610" wikidata="Q1538429" url="?curid=1144610" title="Espelette pepper">
<text>The Espelette pepper (French: &quot;piment d&#x27;Espelette&quot; ; Basque: &quot;Ezpeletako biperra&quot;) is a variety of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot; that is cultivated in the French commune of Espelette, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, traditionally the northern territory of the Basque people. On 1 June 2000, it was classified as an AOC product and was confirmed as a PDO product on 22 August 2002. Its flavor is described as sweet, fruity, and berry-like with a mild heat. 

Chili pepper, originating in Central and South America, was introduced into France during the 16th century. After first being used medicinally, it became popular as a condiment and for the conservation of meats. It is now a cornerstone of Basque cuisine, where it has gradually replaced black pepper and it is a key ingredient in piperade.

AOC espelette peppers are cultivated in the following communes: Ainhoa, Cambo-les-Bains, Espelette, Halsou, Itxassou, Jatxou, Larressore, Saint-Pée-sur-Nivelle, Souraïde, and Ustaritz. Piment d&#x27;Espelette must be produced from the Gorria variety of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;. Irrigation is prohibited, except for the month after planting and the plant density must be 10,000 to 30,000 plants per hectare. They are harvested in late summer and, in September, characteristic festoons of pepper are hung on balconies and house walls throughout the communes to dry out. An annual pepper festival organized by Confrérie du Piment d&#x27;Espelette, held since 1968 on the last weekend in October, attracts some 20,000 tourists.

This pepper attains a maximum grade of only 4,000 on the Scoville scale and is therefore considered only mildly hot. It can be purchased as festoons of fresh or dried peppers, as ground pepper, or puréed or pickled in jars.

In California in the United States, non-AOC espelette peppers are grown and marketed. 

According to the Syndicat du Piment d’Espelette, the cooperative formed to get the AOC designation, there are 160 producers of AOC Piment d&#x27;Espelette that plant and in 2014, they produced 203 tons of powdered Piment d&#x27;Espelette and 1,300 tons of raw pepper.

<doc id="1144613" wikidata="Q2199672" url="?curid=1144613" title="Fazeley">
<text>Fazeley is an industrial town and civil parish in the Lichfield District of Staffordshire, England, south of Tamworth town centre. The civil parish includes Mile Oak and the hamlet of Bonehill. Fazeley forms part of the Tamworth Built-up area.

It sits astride the junction of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and Coventry Canal; at Fazeley Junction are a couple of multi storey mills. Fazeley is also adjacent to Drayton Manor, formerly the home of Robert Peel and now a theme park and zoo.

==History==
The name Fazeley in its various spellings is found in documents dating back to 1135. All suggestions concerning its derivation propose that it comes from early Saxon language most take its meaning to be pasture land or pleasant pasture but another authority suggests it is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon faresleia which meant bulls&#x27; pasture. The various spellings support this latter suggestion and certainly the land alongside the River Tame, being very flat, may well have been used for this purpose. 

The hamlet of Bonehill developed to support the home of Sir Robert Peel MP - Bonehill house. Bonehill originally consisted of farm buildings and horse breeding (stud farm) facilities to support the Peels interests.

In the centre of the town, Fazeley Town Hall was originally named the Victoria Memorial Hall, commemorating the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria. James Eadie paid for both the cost of its construction, £3,000, and the land on which it stands: it was completed in 1898. Eadie intended that the Hall should benefit the inhabitants of Fazeley and help to promote their welfare. His vision was that the Hall would be used for public meetings, lectures and concerts and contain reading rooms and speculated that technical classes might some day be held &quot;for the better training of workmen in their several crafts and industries.&quot; The vision became a reality; meetings of all descriptions took place and winter entertainments were regularly well attended. There was a library and a reading room, classes were held in gymnastics and cookery, and an Evening Continuation School in horticulture attracted over 40 youngsters. In later years, silent movies were presented here, too.

The First Annual Fazeley Festival and Mile Oak Mile Charity hop took place on 15 September 2007.

==Transport==
Fazeley sits astride the old Roman road of Watling Street, which is now much quieter following the rerouting of the A5 road to a new course between Fazeley and Tamworth. The road is now designated the B5404. Fazeley Bridge crosses the River Tame and separates Two Gates from Fazeley. The Tame at this point is the boundary between the districts of Lichfield and Tamworth and was formerly the boundary between Staffordshire and Warwickshire. The bridge was built in 1796 to replace an earlier one destroyed by flooding. It is Grade II listed and has three segmental arches constructed of ashlar.

Until 1904, Wilnecote Station in nearby Two Gates was known as Wilnecote and Fazeley.

Fazeley is served by regular Arriva bus service 110 from Tamworth to Birmingham.
==Governance==
===Fazeley Town Council===

Fazeley Town Council consists of eleven elected councillors. Of the eleven councillors, eight are from the Conservative Party and three from the Labour Party. In May 2012, at 21 years of age, Councillor Rebecca James became the youngest person ever to hold the post of The Worshipful The mayor of Fazeley and was Fazeley Town Council&#x27;s youngest councillor at 18 years of age when she was elected in January 2009.

The current mayor of Fazeley is Cllr Olivia-Joy Shepherd. 

Fazeley Town Hall is used for both public and private events including, bingo, dancing, parties and carpet sales and Fazeley Town Council holds its meetings in the building.

===Local authority===
Despite bordering Tamworth, Fazeley is part of Lichfield District. Fazeley is also covered by Staffordshire County Council.

==Education==
Fazeley has two primary schools, Millfield County Primary School and Longwood Primary School, in Mile Oak. Millfield was built in Victorian times and part of the original building remains.

<text>The Lords Temporal are secular members of the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament. These can be either life peers or hereditary peers, although the hereditary right to sit in the House of Lords was abolished for all but ninety-two peers during the 1999 reform of the House of Lords. The term is used to differentiate these members from the Lords Spiritual, who sit in the House as a consequence of being bishops in the Church of England.

== History ==

Membership in the Lords Temporal was once an entitlement of all hereditary peers, other than those in the peerage of Ireland. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, the right to membership was restricted to 92 hereditary peers. 

Further reform of the House of Lords is a perennially-discussed issue in British politics. However, no additional legislation on this issue has passed the House of Commons since 1999. The Wakeham Commission, which debated the issue of lords&#x27; reform under then Prime Minister Tony Blair, proposed making some of the Lords Temporal elected positions. This plan, which was widely criticised, failed to advance in the House of Commons. Additional proposals were made under the coalition government of Prime Minister David Cameron to reduce the size of the House of Lords to 450, directly elect at least some of the Lords Temporal, and allow members of the House of Commons to run for election as Lords Temporal. None of these proposals passed.

== Composition of the Lords Temporal ==

The Lords Temporal consist of a smaller number of hereditary peers and a much larger contingent of life peers.

=== Hereditary peers ===
The Lords Temporal has historically included several hundred hereditary peers (English peers as well as Scottish Lords of Parliament). Such hereditary offices can be created by the Crown and in modern times are usually created only under the advice of the Prime Minister.

Holders of Scottish and Irish peerages were not always permitted to sit in the Lords. When Scotland united with England to form Great Britain in 1707, it was provided that the Scottish hereditary peers would only be able to elect 16 Scottish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords; the term of a representative was to extend until the next general election. A similar provision was enacted when Ireland merged with Great Britain in 1801 to form the United Kingdom; the Irish peers were allowed to elect 28 representatives, who were to retain office for life. Elections for Irish representatives ended in 1922, when most of Ireland became an independent state; elections for Scottish representatives ended with the passage of the Peerage Act 1963, under which all Scottish peers obtained seats in the Upper House.

After the 1999 reform, only 92 hereditary peers remain as Lords Temporal. Two are the Earl Marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain. Of the remaining ninety peers sitting in the Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage, 15 are elected by the whole House and 75 are chosen by fellow hereditary peers in the House of Lords, grouped by party.

=== Life peers ===

The largest group of Lords Temporal, and indeed of the whole House, are life peers. As of March 2024 there are 670 life peers. Life peerages rank only as barons or baronesses, and are created under the Life Peerages Act 1958. Like all other peers, life peers are created by the Crown, who acts on the advice of the Prime Minister or the House of Lords Appointments Commission. However, by convention, the Prime Minister allows leaders of other parties to nominate some life peers, to maintain political equilibrium.

In 2000, the government announced it would set up an Independent Appointments Commission, under Lord Stevenson of Coddenham, to select fifteen so-called &quot;people&#x27;s peers&quot; for life peerages.

=== Defunct groupings ===

==== Law lords ====

Until the establishment of the Supreme Court in 2009, a subset of the Lords Temporal – known as the Law Lords – acted as the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom judicial system. These lords became the first justices of the UK Supreme Court.

<doc id="1144622" wikidata="Q1280800" url="?curid=1144622" title="Echobelly">
<text>Echobelly are a British rock band, debuting in 1994 with their album &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Got One&quot;. They were often compared to Blondie and the Smiths, with Morrissey becoming a fan of the group.

The most prominent part of Echobelly&#x27;s success formula was vocalist Sonya Madan, who was also the group&#x27;s lyricist. Born in Delhi, India, before moving to England at the age of two, Madan had an atypical background for a pop star. Her upbringing made rock music an unusual choice for her as a youngster and she did not attend her first rock concert until she was in college. In 1990 she met Glenn Johansson, a guitarist from Sweden. In a radio interview with Janice Long, on BBC Radio Wales, in December 2017, she admitted that her parents had initially found it hard to accept her choice of career.

==Career==
In 1992, Madan and Johansson first met in a pub, with Sonya expressing her desire to sing in a band: &quot;I used to sing to myself as a child. I suppose I had a secret desire to sing.&quot; They soon teamed up with bass guitarist Alex Keyser and drummer Andy Henderson, who had previously played with PJ Harvey&#x27;s band. Guitarist Debbie Smith, formerly of Curve, came on board in 1994. According to the Epic Records&#x27; website, the group came up with the name Echobelly from the notion of &quot;being hungry for something&quot;. With Madan and Johansson as the band&#x27;s songwriters, they recorded their debut EP, &quot;Bellyache&quot;, on the independent Pandemonium label in late 1993.

The favourable response to &quot;Bellyache&quot; helped Echobelly secure a recording contract with Rhythm King, which was then part of Epic. Once on board the label, the group released the &quot;I Can&#x27;t Imagine the World Without Me&quot; single in June 1994. The group then recorded the album &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Got One&quot;, which included the single &quot;Insomniac&quot; and reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. The single was featured in the film and soundtrack of &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.

As their music received more airplay, Echobelly won admiration from other artists as well. Madonna expressed interest in putting them on her Maverick label (existing contractual arrangements prevented that), and R.E.M. requested the group as the opening act for their upcoming tour. The band returned to the studio in 1995 to create their next album, &quot;On&quot;, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, who had also produced Hole and Radiohead.

Madan&#x27;s lyrics often ventured into the less explored side of life, addressed in songs such as &quot;King of the Kerb&quot;. and &quot;Dark Therapy&quot;. &quot;I wanted to challenge myself as a lyricist on a different level on this album,&quot; Madan said in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;I want people to tell me what they thought the lyrics are about. I&#x27;m not a politician. I&#x27;m not interested in changing everybody around me. I&#x27;m interested in myself.&quot;

While many of the songs lamented the state of things, others on the &quot;On&quot; album celebrated the endless possibilities of the human spirit. In &quot;Great Things&quot;, Madan sang &quot;I want to do great things / I don&#x27;t want to compromise / I want to know what love is / I want to know everything.&quot; The album&#x27;s mostly optimistic feel provides an intriguing contrast with its serious subject matter. As Pareles wrote, &quot;Both music and lyrics examine the tension between order and liberty&quot;. Listeners in the UK responded favourably to the album, driving three singles from the release into the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Sales of the album rose to over 150,000 in the UK, nearly double that of &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Got One&quot;.

Health and legal problems interrupted the success of Echobelly in 1995 and 1996. Madan had a serious thyroid problem during her world tour that was potentially life-threatening, but was later cured. Bass guitarist James Harris joined after Keyser defected because of personal and artistic differences. The group also had disagreements with Rhythm King after the label moved to Arista. The band chose to stay with Epic. In 1996, Madan also ventured away from the group when she sang on a recording of the club band, Lithium. Smith left the band before the release of the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Lustra&quot;, which was produced by Gil Norton and issued in November 1997. A single from the album, &quot;The World is Flat&quot;, was released in August of that year.

A four-year hiatus was brought to an end in 2001 when the band returned with the &quot;Digit&quot; EP and their fourth album, &quot;People Are Expensive&quot; (produced by Ben Hillier), which were released on their own Fry Up label. Two further singles, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; (a remixed version of the album track) followed.

In 2004, Echobelly released a fifth album, again through their own Fry Up label, &quot;Gravity Pulls&quot; (produced by Ian Grimble).

===2009 acoustic show and future===
Madan and Johansson performed an acoustic show featuring brand-new songs and older Echobelly tracks in Manchester on 9 July 2009 at MoHo Live, supported by Spyglass. New material was demoed during this show which turned out to be part of two mini-albums that had already commenced recording under the alternative name Calm Of Zero. Alex Reeves was brought in to record the drumming and percussion for the albums. &quot;Acoustic Sessions 1&quot; was released in January 2011 and &quot;Acoustic Sessions 2&quot; in October 2012. Another song, &quot;Molotov&quot;, became available for playback on Echobelly&#x27;s official Myspace page during January.

On 21 July 2014, British independent record label 3 Loop Music released two-CD expanded editions of Echobelly&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Got One&quot; and &quot;On&quot; albums. The re-releases included b-sides, live recordings, radio session tracks and unreleased material. A limited number of signed copies were also made available on the label&#x27;s official online store.

In October 2015, Echobelly made a successful return to stage, playing a sell-out gig at the 1,500-capacity Scala venue in London.

On 31 May 2016, it was announced that Echobelly were entering the studio to record a new album entitled &quot;Anarchy and Alchemy&quot;. The album was released on 26 May 2017.

In December 2018, a compilation album entitled &quot;Black Heart Lullabies&quot; was released.

<doc id="1144624" wikidata="Q466403" url="?curid=1144624" title="Radical initiator">
<text>In chemistry, radical initiators are substances that can produce radical species under mild conditions and promote radical reactions. These substances generally possess weak bonds—bonds that have small bond dissociation energies. Radical initiators are utilized in industrial processes such as polymer synthesis. Typical examples are molecules with a nitrogen-halogen bond, azo compounds, and organic and inorganic peroxides.

==Main types of initiation reaction==
*Halogens undergo homolytic fission relatively easily. Chlorine, for example, gives two chlorine radicals (Cl•) by irradiation with ultraviolet light. This process is used for chlorination of alkanes.
*Azo compounds (R-N=N-R&#x27;) can be the precursor of two carbon-centered radicals (R• and R&#x27;•) and nitrogen gas upon heating and/or by irradiation. For example, AIBN and ABCN yield isobutyronitrile and cyclohexanecarbonitrile radicals, respectively.

*Organic peroxides each have a peroxide bond (-O-O-), which is readily cleaved to give two oxygen-centered radicals. The oxyl radicals are unstable and believed to be transformed into relatively stable carbon-centered radicals. For example, di-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl peroxide (&quot;t&quot;-BuOO&quot;t&quot;-Bu) gives two &quot;t&quot;-butoxy radicals (&quot;t&quot;-BuO•) and the radicals become methyl radicals (CH3•) with the loss of acetone. Benzoyl peroxide ((PhC)OO)2) generates benzoyloxyl radicals (PhCOO•), each of which loses carbon dioxide to be converted into a phenyl radical (Ph•). Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is also common, and acetone peroxide is on rare occasions used as a radical initiator, too.
*Inorganic peroxides function analogously to organic peroxides. Many polymers are often produced from the alkenes upon initiation with peroxydisulfate salts. In solution, peroxydisulfate dissociates to give sulfate radicals:
:[O3SO-OSO3]2− 2 [SO4]−
The sulfate radical adds to an alkene forming radical sulfate esters, e.g. .CHPhCH2OSO3−, that add further alkenes via formation of C-C bonds. Many styrene and fluoroalkene polymers are produced in this way.

* In atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), carbon-halides reversibly generate organic radicals in the presence of transition metal catalyst. 


==Safety==
Some radical initiators such as azo compounds and peroxides can detonate at elevated temperatures so they must be stored cold.

<doc id="1144629" wikidata="Q2583910" url="?curid=1144629" title="Treehouse of Horror XV">
<text>&quot;Treehouse of Horror XV&quot; is the first episode of the sixteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 2004. In the fifteenth annual &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot;, Ned Flanders&#x27; head injury gives him the power to predict others&#x27; deaths, Bart and Lisa play detective when a string of Victorian-era prostitutes are murdered by Jack the Ripper, and the Simpsons go on a fantastic voyage inside Mr. Burns&#x27; body to save Maggie. It was written by Bill Odenkirk and directed by David Silverman. Around 11.29 million Americans tuned in to watch the episode during its original broadcast. Airing on November 7, it is the latest date that a Treehouse of Horror has aired, (tied with Treehouse of Horror XXI) but had to be held back a week due to Fox&#x27;s contractual obligation to air the World Series.

== Plot ==
=== Opening sequence ===
Kang and Kodos star in a fictional sitcom, entitled &quot;Keepin&#x27; it Kodos&quot;. In it, Kodos is preparing their boss&#x27; visit by cooking dinner: Homer on a baking tray (continually eating himself), Bart on a skillet, Marge and Maggie in pies and Lisa in a soup (with Bart seemingly being the only family member to be in pain). The boss gives the meal a delicious rating, but his stomach bursts, liberating Bart. Kang and Kodos are given a hyper-galactic promotion, much to the aliens&#x27; delight. Bart is sad about the loss of his parents and sisters, but Kang and Kodos decide to adopt him, which comforts Bart. The theme song from &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; plays as the Treehouse of Horror logo appears on the screen; an alien tentacle stamps the &quot;XV&quot; underneath which makes it say the title of the episode in the fashion of the Mark VII Limited company logo.

=== The Ned Zone ===
In a parody of &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, Homer tries to get his frisbee from the roof by throwing a bowling ball after it. The ball strikes a passing Ned Flanders on the head. When Ned recovers in Dr. Hibbert&#x27;s hospital, he has a vision of Hibbert falling out of a window to his death. Homer then asks Hibbert to retrieve his frisbee from a ledge on the hospital. As Hibbert reaches for the ledge, he slips out of the window, causing Ned&#x27;s vision to come true. Ned realizes that he can see the deaths of people whom he touches. After he gets out of the hospital, he attempts to save Hans Moleman from falling down but has a vision of him being eaten by alligators. In shock, he drops Moleman into an open manhole with dozens of alligators swimming in it. He also predicts the closing of the Rosie O&#x27;Donnell musical, which he already suspected.

A later vision depicts him shooting Homer, which horrifies Ned, leading him to try and conceal it from Homer and prevent it from coming true by leaving Springfield. When Homer finds out, he taunts Ned and even gives him Chief Wiggum&#x27;s gun to shoot him with, and says he could not even shoot him by accident. Ned refrains from shooting Homer, seemingly changing the future, but then has another vision of Homer blowing up Springfield by pressing the &quot;Core Destruct&quot; button at the nuclear power plant. Ned tries to dissuade Homer from going to work, but Homer goes anyway because there is an ice cream cake for Lenny&#x27;s birthday. Ned rushes to the power plant to stop Homer. Unfortunately, Ned&#x27;s warning is scrambled by static over the intercom, sounding as if he is encouraging Homer to press the button. In desperation, Ned grabs a nearby security guard&#x27;s gun to shoot Homer, fulfilling the original prediction, but in his death throes, Homer presses the destruct button with his tongue, much to Ned&#x27;s fury before the power plant explodes and Springfield is destroyed. Ned and the Simpsons go to Heaven as angels, with Marge accusing Homer of blowing up Springfield just to get out of cleaning the garage (which also entered Heaven as an angel). Just as Homer muses over whether he could blow up Heaven, they meet God (again), who proceeds to give Homer &quot;what he deserves&quot; – his frisbee.

=== Four Beheadings and a Funeral ===
In a parody of &quot;From Hell&quot;, taking place in 1890, London&#x27;s prostitutes are being killed with swords in a series of unsolved murders by &quot;The Muttonchop Murderer&quot;. Scotland Yard&#x27;s Inspector Wiggum challenges master detective Eliza Simpson and her easily amazed, goofy assistant Dr. Bartley to solve the crime, though he orders Apu arrested anyway until they &quot;find somebody darker&quot; to frame. Their first piece of evidence is a bloody sword found by a &quot;&quot;proper-Cockney flower girl&quot;, Marge. Eliza takes the sword to an oddities merchant (Comic Book Guy), who recognizes the sword as part of a set he had sold, called The Seven Swords of Osiris. He goes to check his dusty record books to see who he sold the swords to, but is murdered by the killer. Looking at the ledger, Simpson and Bartley discover the swords were sold to C. Ebenezer Burns, an industrialist who &quot;makes coal out of babies&quot;. Bartley knows where to find Burns and tracks him down at Mao&#x27;s Den of Inequity, an opium den. Burns instantly recognizes the sword, and tells Simpson that he sold them for opium to a &quot;fat man with sideburns&quot;, and notices a man nearby who resembles the description, Homer. Eliza and Bartley chase him down and Homer gets caught by Wiggum, who happens to be at the opium den as well, because smoking opium is the only thing that helps his son Ralph go to sleep.

Eliza and Bartley congratulate themselves for solving the crime, until they find another body, Selma, stabbed by another Sword of Osiris. Bartley first dismisses the body as having been killed days prior, pointing out the body as bloated and the face rotten, though Selma stays alive long enough to say it was just &quot;5 minutes ago&quot;&quot;. Eliza takes the sword and recognizes a certain scent on the sword handle. The next day, just before Homer is hanged for the murders, Elia arrives, declaring Homer innocent due to the smell of eel pie on the handle, which Wiggum loves to eat. Officer Lou then reveals that Wiggum has muttonchops as well, exposing him as the killer. He starts to explain that he just wanted to come up with a case that Eliza herself could not solve, but then flees in a hot-air balloon stolen from Professor Frink, but it gets pierced by a steampunk-style flying saucer flown by Kang and Kodos, who consider Earth&#x27;s air fleet as destroyed. It is then shown that the whole story was an opium-caused dream by Ralph, which Wiggum reveals is part of an even crazier and fantastical dream that both of them are in.

=== In the Belly of the Boss ===
In a parody of &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, at the &quot;Invention Expo&quot;, Professor Frink creates a machine that shrinks objects. Maggie crawls inside a giant pill, thinking that it is a ball pit, which is miniaturized and swallowed by Mr. Burns. When the rest of the family realizes what has happened, they agree to be shrunk within a craft and injected into Burns&#x27; body. Homer is the craft&#x27;s captain, Lisa is in charge of science and research, Bart is in charge of security, and Marge is in charge of helping the deeps of the science. When Homer refuses to follow Frink&#x27;s instructions, the ship gets stuck in Burns&#x27; heart. The crew manage to get the ship free from the outside and are able to reach the stomach by catching a ride on a nerve impulse, which Lisa calls &quot;the body&#x27;s information superhighway&quot;. They manage to save Maggie, but Homer is forced to leave the ship and save the rest on his own when their craft does not have enough power to save them all due to the addition of Maggie&#x27;s extra weight. Homer becomes initially despondent at his family is forced to leave him behind, but finds consolation in finding a marshmallow in Burns&#x27; stomach. The submarine successfully escapes, but there is not enough time to save Homer, who instantly returns to his original size inside Burns&#x27; skin, putting them both in extra pain. Even though Homer complains that Burns needs several extra holes, Burns is confident that things will work out. The episode ends with Burns and Homer leading a dance to the tune of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; (along with the characters from all three segments and the opening sequence). The &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; theme is then played again over the end credits featuring still images from the episode.

== Reception ==
The episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. Pip Ellwood Hughes was positive and said &quot;In the Belly of the Boss&quot; was the best segment of the three. Kevin Yeoman disliked the episode saying &quot;much of it was old hat, and comfortably so. The best example of this is in the &#x27;Treehouse of Horror XV&#x27; episode, which not only fails to elicit a single laugh, but also demonstrates how much the annual tradition had come to rely on spoofing pop-culture or horror films, rather than using the conventions of the genre to craft something funny and memorable. The execrable &#x27;Four Beheadings and a Funeral&#x27; and &#x27;In the Belly of the Boss&#x27; showing just how unfunny and lazily written these Halloween episodes can sometimes be.&quot; Chris Morgan of Cinema Sentries thought the quality of the episode was questionable. On John Hugar&#x27;s top 25 Treehouse of Horror episodes he placed the episode at #21. He enjoyed &quot;The Ned Zone&quot; but thought &quot;Four Beheadings and a Funeral&quot; &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;In the Belly of the Boss&quot; done better before. When ranking the top 78 Treehouse of Horror segments Louis Peitzman was positive on the segments. He placed &quot;The Ned Zone at #56 and said &quot;it&#x27;s fairly well done&quot; but said &quot;like so many early 2000s episodes, it goes too far.&quot; &quot;Four Beheadings and a Funeral&quot; was put at #49 and said &quot;The distinctive look of the segment is great, and the murders are gruesome, but the mystery-solving itself isn’t worth more than a shrug.&quot; &quot;In the Belly of the Boss&quot; was placed highest at #44 and he thought it had its moments.

<text>Jeong Yong-jun (; born December 20, 1976), better known as Jang Hyuk, is a South Korean actor. He is best known for his leading roles in the films &quot;Volcano High&quot; (2001), &quot;Windstruck&quot; (2004), &quot;The Flu&quot; (2013), as well as the television series &quot;Successful Story of a Bright Girl&quot; (2002), &quot;Thank You&quot; (2007), &quot;The Slave Hunters&quot; (2010), &quot;Deep Rooted Tree&quot; (2011), &quot;You Are My Destiny&quot; (2014), &quot;Voice&quot; (2017), &quot;Money Flower&quot; (2017–18), and &quot;Bloody Heart&quot; (2022).

== Career ==
===1997–2001: Beginnings and rise to fame===
Jang Yong-jun spent most of his childhood and adolescence in his birthplace, Busan. In 1996, Jeong Hoon-tak, who ran a management company named EBM Production Co., after success elevated Jung Woo-sung and Kim Ji-ho as top star, met Jeong Yong-jun, a 20-year-old young man who was a student at Seoul Institute of the Arts. He was convinced that the innocence in the face of Jung Yong-joon, which exudes sadness and strange charisma would become a “weapon”. Jung Hoon-tak pushed Jung Yong-joon into the accommodation of the group god members who were still preparing for their debut. And started the harsh training. With Jung, who has his own confidence that “only those who are prepared can succeed,” Jung Yong-joon prepared for a long time. 

After Lee Seung-hwan&#x27;s music video, Jung Yong-joon making his acting debut in 1997 in the television drama &quot;Model&quot; under his stage name Jang hyuk. Besides the teen series &quot;School&quot; (1999) and a minor role in the little-seen film &quot;Zzang (The Best)&quot;, Jang appeared in the music video of &quot;To Mother&quot;, the 1999 debut single of popular boyband g.o.d, whom he was housemates with at that time. Also in 1999, he played the good-hearted yet aggressive Myung-ha in the series &quot;Into the Sunlight&quot;. Using the stage name &quot;TJ&quot;, he had a brief career as a rapper and acted in several music videos from his rap album &quot;TJ Project&quot;, which was released in 2000. 

Jang&#x27;s career first began to take off in 2001, when he was cast in the lead role of the special-effects extravaganza &quot;Volcano High&quot; with actress Shin Min-a. His acting in the eccentric role drew praise from fans and critics.

===2002–2004: Mainstream popularity and controversy===
In 2002 he continued to make a name for himself, starring in the sleeper hit &quot;Jungle Juice&quot;, which made the top of the weekly box-office. His popularity continued to increase when he starred in the hugely popular TV drama &quot;Successful Story of a Bright Girl&quot; with actress Jang Na-ra. He also took a role in &quot;Public Toilet&quot;, the HK-Korea co-production by acclaimed Hong Kong director Fruit Chan which won a Special Mention in the Upstream section of the 2002 Venice Film Festival.

Jang continued to appear in high-profile projects; in 2003, Jang starred alongside Lee Na-young in the comedy &quot;Please Teach Me English&quot;, by director Kim Sung-su and the following year, he starred opposite Jun Ji-hyun in Kwak Jae-yong&#x27;s &quot;Windstruck&quot;. Although &quot;Windstruck&quot; was generally not well received in Korea, it went on to beat &quot;Shiri&quot; and become one of the best-selling Korean films in Japan.

In late 2004, together with fellow actors Song Seung-heon and Han Jae-suk, Jang was found to have illegally avoided his mandatory military service through his and Han&#x27;s agency SidusHQ. Amid widespread public condemnation, Jang apologized to his fans, then began to serve his two-year military term.

===2006–2009: Career revival and international collaborations===
After his discharge from the military in 2006, Jang made his comeback in the drama series &quot;Thank You&quot;. A heartwarming story about a young single mother (played by Gong Hyo-jin) with an HIV-positive daughter and the cynical doctor who enters their lives, &quot;Thank You&quot; surprisingly became a modest hit, and with it Jang left the stigma of his draft-dodging scandal behind him.

He then signed up for the international movie production &quot;Dance of the Dragon&quot; (2008), a love story that mixed ballroom dancing with martial arts action and costarred Singaporean actress Fann Wong. He won the Best Actor award at the inaugural West Hollywood International Film Festival for his role. Jang also made a cameo in Japanese drama &quot;Ryokiteki na Kanojo&quot;, a remake of the 2001 Korean film &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot;. After his earlier guesting on star Tsuyoshi Kusanagi&#x27;s talk show, the director of the drama reportedly added new scenes for Jang that were not included in the original script. Jang then appeared as the love interest in three music videos of Taiwanese singer Elva Hsiao.

More leading roles in TV dramas followed, including &quot;Robber&quot; (2008) and &quot;Tazza&quot; (2008) adapted from the gambling manhwa. In 2009, he appeared in the short film &quot;His Concern&quot; in the omnibus &quot;Five Senses of Eros&quot;, the risque thriller &quot;Searching for the Elephant&quot;, and the melodrama &quot;Maybe&quot;.

===2010–2013: Critical acclaim and continued success===
In 2010, he received the best reviews of his career for his leading role as the slave hunter (&quot;chuno&quot;) Dae-gil in the hit fusion period drama &quot;The Slave Hunters&quot;. His acting coach of 14 years described Jang as being relentless in his analysis of a character. According to Jang, &quot;It is easy to fail if you don&#x27;t understand the steps one has to take to be famous.&quot; He won several acting awards, most significantly the Grand Prize (&quot;Daesang&quot;) at the KBS Drama Awards, and a Best Actor nomination at the 2011 International Emmy Awards.

In the same year, he starred in &quot;Fall in Love with Anchor Beauty&quot;, the Chinese remake of 2000 Korean drama &quot;All About Eve&quot;. &quot;Fall in Love with Anchor Beauty&quot; received high ratings in China during its run.

Back in Korea, Jang played a fund manager-turned-lawyer in 2011&#x27;s &quot;Midas&quot;, also starring Lee Min-jung and Kim Hee-ae. He next starred in legal thriller &quot;The Client&quot; (2011) with Ha Jung-woo and Park Hee-soon, saying the film satisfied his wish to portray a more emotionally complex persona. Playing a man accused of murdering his wife, Jang said he had to find &quot;the right balance&quot; &quot;as someone who can appear at times like a criminal or at other times like an innocent man.&quot;

Initially reluctant to sign on to period drama &quot;Deep Rooted Tree&quot; (2011) because he found the role of low-level royal guard Kang Chae-yoon uninteresting in the original novel, Jang changed his mind upon reading that the character had been dramatized and made richer in the TV script. It tells the story of Kang investigating a case involving the serial murders of Jiphyeonjeon scholars in Gyeongbok Palace while King Sejong (played by Han Suk-kyu) is developing the Korean alphabet.

In 2013, he headlined &quot;Iris II&quot;, the sequel to the 2009 spy action series. This was his third acting collaboration with actress Lee Da-hae, after &quot;Robber&quot; and &quot;The Slave Hunters&quot;. He also returned to the big screen in 2013 blockbuster disaster film &quot;The Flu&quot;, in which he and Soo Ae played a firefighter and a doctor racing against time to find the cure for a deadly strain of the cold virus.

To the surprise of many given his past draft-dodging scandal, he then joined &quot;Real Men&quot;, a weekly show in which six male celebrities are filmed documentary-style as they enter army boot camp. This was Jang&#x27;s first regular appearance on a variety/reality show in his 17-year acting career. He said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to use this opportunity to reflect on myself through &quot;Real Men&quot; and to experience army life again.&quot; He appeared on &quot;Real Men&quot; from June 2013 to February 2014. He then wrote a collection of essays on his life experiences titled &quot;Jang Hyuk, Hot-Blooded Man&quot;, published on August 6, 2013.

===2014–present===
In 2014, he reunited with &quot;Volcano High&quot; director Kim Tae-kyun in &quot;Innocent Thing&quot;, a thriller about a high school girl who becomes obsessed with her married gym teacher. He also teamed up again with &quot;Successful Story of a Bright Girl&quot; costar Jang Na-ra in &quot;You Are My Destiny&quot;, a Korean remake of the similarly titled 2008 Taiwanese drama. Shortly after, he and Jang starred together for the third time in &quot;Old Farewell&quot;, about a boxer who travels into the past and re-encounters his recently deceased wife. It was part of the single-episode anthology &quot;Drama Festival&quot;, and helmed by one of their directors on &quot;Fated&quot;.

In 2015, Jang returned to the milieu of period dramas with &quot;Shine or Go Crazy&quot;, a fictional romance between a cursed Goryeo prince and the last princess of Balhae. The film &quot;Empire of Lust&quot; followed, in which he played the wily and ambitious Yi Bang-won who launched a coup to become the king of Joseon. He was next cast in the Chinese film &quot;Inside or Outside&quot;, a detective mystery co-starring Simon Yam and Wallace Huo. Jang then played a Joseon innkeeper merchant in &quot;The Merchant: Gaekju 2015&quot;.

In 2016, Jang was cast in the Chinese drama &quot;New Sea&quot;. Back in Korea, Jang starred in KBS&#x27;s medical drama &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, playing a genius neurosurgeon. Though the drama was critically praised, the number of episodes were brought down from 16 to 14 because of low viewer ratings.

In 2017, he starred in his first cable drama, crime thriller &quot;Voice&quot; by OCN, where he played an ex-detective who joined a call center&#x27;s team to track his wife&#x27;s killer. &quot;Voice&quot; became a hit and its ratings broke OCN&#x27;s dramas records when it was aired in Korea. His movie &quot;Ordinary Person&quot; opposite Son Hyun-joo was released in March 2017, where he acted as a manipulative National Planning Security chief. He also starred in weekend drama &quot;Money Flower&quot;, earning much acclaim and a Baeksang Arts Awards Best Actor nomination for his role as a revenge-seeking lawyer. The same year, he was cast in action film &quot;The Swordsman&quot;.

In 2018, Jang returned to the small screen with SBS&#x27; romantic comedy drama &quot;Wok of Love&quot;, playing a former gangster turned restaurant owner; and MBC&#x27;s action melodrama &quot;Bad Papa&quot;, playing a former champion boxer who chose to become a bad man in order to become a good father.

In 2019, he took part in reality TV program &quot;Urban Cops&quot; where celebrities team up with real life cops to solve crimes in the city. The same year, he was cast in the historical drama &quot;My Country: The New Age&quot;, playing the role of Yi Bang-won.

In 2022, Jang returned to the small screen with KBS2&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Bloody Heart&quot;, playing the first vice-premier and a living symbol of power and a figure that everyone obeys. His movie &quot;The Killer: A Girl Who Deserves to Die&quot; made its world premiere at the Udine Far East Film Festival in April 2022, held a red carpet premiere at Los Angeles in June 2022 and hit the big screens simultaneously in South Korea and North America on 13 July 2022. He also won the Daniel A. Craft award for Excellence in Action Cinema at the 21st New York Asian Film Festival. In November 2022, he took part as a judge in tvN&#x27;s variety program &quot;Super Action&quot;.

In March 2023, Jang decided not to renew his contract with Sidus HQ after working with the agency for 26 years since his debut.

Walter Sr. (September 18, 1922 – January 6, 2000), of Tampa, Florida, United States, was a home builder who started &quot;Jim Walter Homes&quot; and &quot;Walter Industries&quot;, now doing business as Walter Energy, Inc., a leading producer of metallurgical coal for the global steel industry, in 1946 with $1,000 he borrowed from his father. Walter eventually sold the company in 1986 for $2 billion to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR).

Walter was the son of Ebe and Mabel Walter. The book &quot;Building a Business: The Jim Walter Story&quot; tells his story. His wife, Monica Walter, died in 1982, leaving two sons, James W. Walter Jr. and Robert Walter. The western section of what was known as Columbus Drive was renamed Jim Walter Boulevard in 2003.

==Jim Walter Homes==
Jim Walter Homes were &quot;shell&quot; homes, meaning the company would complete the outside so that the house was watertight, then allow the customer to finish the inside with their own labor. The company would also sell most of the inside materials, including sheetrock, insulation, doors and carpet to the customer and include them in the purchase. The result was very affordable mortgage payments, usually for 20 years. The only requirement from the company was that the customer had owned the land on which the house was constructed, meaning that in the case of foreclosure the company got not only a (potentially never-finished) house but a building lot as well. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, when mortgage rates went as high as 15%, Jim Walter offered 10% financing with no money down.

In 1961 Walter bought Celotex using just stock in Jim Walter Homes. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Jonah has just swallowed the whale.&quot;

In 1968, Walter bought US Pipe and Foundry. Later, Walter acquired Fry Roofing, Georgia Marble, and various other building material companies.

In 1988, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired Jim Walter Corp. (later Walter Industries) for $3.3 billion in early 1988 but faced issues with the buyout almost immediately. Most notably, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corp (Celotex) faced a large asbestos lawsuit and incurred liabilities that the courts ruled would need to be satisfied by the parent company. In 1989, the holding company that KKR used for the Jim Walter buyout filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Walter Industries, its parent, closed Jim Walter Homes in January 2009, just prior to the separation of its related financing business. Upon separation of Financing, Walter Industries, which in 2008 derived most of its revenues from its core natural resources and energy businesses, rebranded itself Walter Energy, reflecting its focus on these core businesses.

<text>Michel Charles Sardou (; born 26 January 1947) is a French singer and occasional actor.

He is known not only for his love songs (&quot;La maladie d&#x27;amour&quot;, &quot;Je vais t&#x27;aimer&quot;), but also for songs dealing with various social and political issues, such as the rights of women in Islamic countries (&quot;Musulmanes&quot;), clerical celibacy (&quot;Le curé&quot;), colonialism (&quot;Le temps des colonies&quot;, &quot;Ils ont le pétrole mais c&#x27;est tout&quot;) or the death penalty (&quot;Je suis pour&quot;). Another sometimes controversial theme found in some of his songs (&quot;Les Ricains&quot; and &quot;Monsieur le Président de France&quot; for example) is his respect and support for the culture and foreign policies of the United States of America. He has been accused of being a racist due to his 1976 song &quot;Le temps des colonies&quot;, in which a former colonial soldier proudly tells his memories of colonialism, but Sardou has always claimed the song was sarcastic. His 1981 single &quot;Les lacs du Connemara&quot; was an international hit (especially in the Netherlands). A number of his hit songs were written in collaboration with Jacques Revaux and Pierre Delanoë, a few others (most notably &quot;En chantant&quot;) with Italian singer Toto Cutugno.

Sardou sold out eighteen consecutive dates at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in 2001, while his 2004 album &quot;Du plaisir&quot; went straight to the number one spot on the French album charts. With a recording career of fifty years, Sardou has released 25 studio albums, 18 live albums and has recorded more than 350 songs (chiefly in French but also in Spanish, Italian and even English) and has sold more than 100 million records. Currently he is considered one of the most popular artists in the Francophone world and one of the most lucrative, both in sales and in his shows.

== Biography ==
=== Childhood ===
Michel Sardou was born on 26 January 1947 in Paris. His father, Fernand Sardou, was a singer and an actor while his mother, Jackie Sardou was an actress. His paternal grandfather, Valentin Sardou, was a comedian in Marseille, while his grandmother was a singer.

Sardou left school at 16.

=== Career ===
==== The early stages (1965–1970) ====
Sardou began working as a waiter in his father&#x27;s cabaret in Montmartre. He eventually met Michel Fugain and auditioned for Eddie Barclay. In 1965, Sardou began his recording career with &quot;Le madras&quot;, co-written with Michel Fugain and Patrice Laffont.

In 1967, his career really picked up, thanks to censorship: while France left NATO&#x27;s integrated military command and the Vietnam War was causing anti-American sentiment in France, Sardou released &quot;Les Ricains&quot; (&quot;The Yanks&quot;), a song which stated the debt of gratitude towards the US for the liberation of France. Charles de Gaulle did not like the song and he advised against its broadcast on state radio and television. This gave the singer a new notoriety, and the song let him lay the foundations for his future artistic style. However, from 1967 to 1970, he still found it difficult to have big hits.

In view of the mitigated success of his singles, in 1969, Eddie Barclay decided to terminate his contract, estimating that Sardou was not cut out to be a singer. So, he founded the record label Tréma (which stands for &quot;Talar Revaux Éditions Musicales Associées&quot;), which would produce his records, with his friends Jacques Revaux (who will become his most loyal composer) and Régis Talar, a French record producer.

==== Success and controversies (1970–1980) ====
He really met true success in 1970, when he released his first studio album, &quot;J&#x27;habite en France&quot;. Three songs extracted from this work became hits : &quot;J&#x27;habite en France&quot; (&quot;I live in France&quot;), &quot;Et mourir de plaisir&quot; (&quot;To die of pleasure&quot;) but mainly &quot;Les bals populaires&quot; (&quot;Popular Dances&quot;), which reached the top of the French chart.

From this album, the hits would be uninterrupted throughout the 1970s. The songs &quot;Le rire du sergent&quot; (&quot;The Sergeant&#x27;s Laugh&quot;) (1971), &quot;Le surveillant général&quot; (&quot;The Superintendent&quot;) (1972) found favour with the public. But his success was sealed in 1973 with the album &quot;La maladie d&#x27;amour&quot;. Its title track &quot;La maladie d&#x27;amour&quot; (&quot;The Disease of Love&quot;), &quot;Les vieux mariés&quot; (which translates as &quot;The old married couple&quot;, but adapted in English under the title &quot;It&#x27;s not too late to start again&quot;) and &quot;Les villes de solitude&quot; (&quot;The Cities of loneliness&quot;) would eventually become great successes. However, this last song triggered a controversy as Sardou takes the role of a man who, tired of his monotonous daily routine, drunkenly expresses his brutal fantasies (of robbing a bank and raping women), but never acts on them. The feminist organisation MLF objected.

The controversies reached their peak in 1976, with the album &quot;La vieille&quot; (&quot;The Old Woman&quot;). The first single from it, &quot;Le France&quot; (&quot;SS France&quot;), released in November 1975, was a message of indignation addressed to the President of France Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, who had just sold the ocean liner SS &quot;France&quot;. The controversial song was welcomed by the trade unions and the Communist Party even though Sardou was seen, because of several other songs, as an archetypal reactionary singer. Even after the album was a real triumph (more than a million copies sold), other extracts, like &quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot; (&quot;I charge men of...&quot;) or &quot;Le temps des colonies&quot; (&quot;The Days of Empire&quot;) are about a singer who defends old conservative values. He was even accused of being a racist and an apologist for colonialism, but he has always insisted that the song is written in character rather than being an expression of his own views. The song &quot;Je suis pour...&quot; (&quot;I am in favour of ...&quot;) puts Sardou in the role of a man in favour of the death penalty because his own son has been killed. In the wake of this, and other political positions expressed by him, Anti-Sardou campaigns were started; their demonstrations regularly disrupted the singer&#x27;s tours, although other left-wingers felt that Sardou was entitled to his freedom of speech.

The next year, in 1977, Sardou moved away from politics. His next album, &quot;La java de Broadway&quot;, contained famous songs, such as &quot;La java de Broadway&quot; (&quot;The Java of Broadway&quot;), &quot;Dix ans plus tôt&quot; (&quot;Ten years earlier&quot;) and a revival of the Claude François hit &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; (the tune of which is best known to English-speaking audiences as &quot;My Way&quot;). The album was a huge success, exactly like the next &quot;Je vole&quot; (1978), which gave him one of his biggest hits, &quot;En chantant&quot; (&quot;Singing&quot;), written together with the Italian singer Toto Cutugno.

==== A legend in motion (1981–2001) ====

The 1980s began under good omens for the singer, with the album &quot;Les lacs du Connemara&quot; from which came two songs considered important to the entire canon of French popular music: &quot;Les lacs du Connemara&quot; (&quot;The Lakes of Connemara&quot;) and &quot;Être une femme&quot; (&quot;Being a woman&quot;).

Throughout the decade, Sardou had a lot of success : &quot;Afrique adieu&quot; (&quot;Farewell, Africa&quot;) in 1982, &quot;Il était là&quot; (&quot;He was here&quot;) in 1982, &quot;Rouge&quot; (&quot;Red&quot;) in 1984, &quot;Chanteur de jazz&quot; (&quot;Jazz Singer&quot;) in 1985, &quot;La même eau qui coule&quot; (&quot;The same water flowing&quot;) in 1988... because his sales did not slow down, whereas a lot of his contemporaries had been forgotten during the disco boom.

However he didn&#x27;t shy away from controversial songs, and even had success with several of them : &quot;Vladimir Ilitch&quot;, in 1983, which both pays tribute to the ideas of Lenin and denounces the drift of the Soviet Union away from them; &quot;Les deux écoles&quot; (&quot;The Two Schools&quot;), in 1984, which recalls the opposition between the free school and the private school with a defence of private schools; &quot;Musulmanes&quot; (&quot;Muslim women&quot;), in 1986, which casts a pessimistic and bitter look at the rights of women in Islamic countries but which also pays a tribute to Arabic culture.

At the end of the 1980s, Sardou received the recognition of his peers by being awarded a Music Victory for &quot;Musulmanes&quot; as the best song of the year.

In the 1990s, the run of hit singles dried up, even if his four albums had very good sales. Sardou chose, for his shows in Paris, the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in 1989, 1991, 1993, 1998 and 2001, and managed to fill this small stadium for a total of 88 times after his tour in 2001, each time with more than spectators. He also holds the record of attendances and performances for this stadium.

He received, in 1990 and in 1999, the Music Victory for the biggest number of spectators gathered at the end of a tour (in 1998, nearly people have come to see him on stage.)

After the album &quot;Français&quot; (2001) and its promotional tour, Sardou announced his retirement from singing.

==== The renewal (2004–2013) ====

In 2004, Sardou signed a contract with the record label Universal Music France for a new album entitled &quot;Du plaisir&quot;, he participated in the French television show &quot;Star Academy&quot; and he organised an international tour in 2004 and 2005, visiting France, Belgium, Switzerland and Canada.

On 13 November 2006, the double album &quot;Hors format&quot; was released. This album includes twenty-three new songs, one of which is a duet with Chimène Badi, &quot;Le chant des hommes&quot; (&quot;The Song of Men&quot;). &quot;Hors Format&quot; has reached copies sold and is a double platinum. In 2007, he started another tour, visiting venues like the Olympia and the Zénith de Paris. &quot;Le Blues Black Brothers&quot; was released January 1, 2004.

He released the album &quot;Être une femme (2010)&quot; on 30 August 2010. Tracks include an electronic style remix by the DJ Laurent Wolf of his own 1980s hit &quot;Être une femme&quot;, and a duet with Céline Dion, &quot;Voler&quot; (&quot;To Fly&quot;). The subsequent tour met with further success.

&quot;Les grands moments&quot; (&quot;The Great Moments&quot;), a compilation album of his greatest hits, was released 22 October 2012. In 2012 and 2013 Sardou gave a show of the same name, showcasing his material all the way back to the mid-1960s. The show was staged at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy for three dates in December 2012 and five dates at the Olympia in June 2013. But medical issues forced Sardou to cancel the twelve last dates.

In September 2014, he began playing the lead role in a play written especially for him by Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt, &quot;Si on recommençait ?&quot; (&quot;If we begin again ?&quot;).

Several of Sardou&#x27;s songs also feature prominently in the French comedy film &quot;La famille Bélier&quot;, released in 2014.

==== Return to Music, New Tour, and Retirement (2023–2024) ====
In November 2022, Michel Sardou announced that he would return to the stage for a new tour with around thirty dates, exclusively in large venues, mainly Zénith arenas. The tour, titled &quot;Je me souviens d&#x27;un adieu&quot; (after his 1995 song), runs from October 3, 2023, at the Zénith in Rouen until March 17, 2024, at the Paris La Défense Arena. 100,000 tickets for the tour sold out in just eight hours.

In September 2023, Michel Sardou released a previously unreleased song, recorded in 1992, titled &quot;En quelle année Georgia,&quot; co-written with Didier Barbelivien and composed by Jean-Pierre Bourtayre.

On March 13, 2024, in an interview with Le Parisien, Michel Sardou announced his retirement from the world of music and theater. He also mentioned that he might consider acting in a film directed by Olivier Marchal, should Marchal be interested.

=== Personal life ===
Sardou married Françoise Pettré, a dancer, in 1965. They have two daughters: Sandrine (born on 15 January 1970) and Cynthia (born on 4 December 1973). They divorced in 1977. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Haas, called &quot;Babette&quot;, in October 1977. They have two sons: Romain, writer (born on 6 January 1974) and Davy, actor (born on 1 June 1978). They divorced in June 1999. On 11 October 1999, married Anne-Marie Périer, the daughter of the actor François Périer and the sister of the photographer Jean-Marie Périer. She is the former editor-in-chief of &quot;Elle&quot; magazine. They were married in Neuilly-sur-Seine by then-mayor Nicolas Sarkozy.

;Hits after 1983 with chart positions
=== Emblematic songs ===
* &quot;Les bals populaires&quot; (&quot;The Popular Dances&quot;), released in 1970. The song deals with the popular village dance parties which were fashionable in the 1970s.
* &quot;La maladie d&#x27;amour&quot; (&quot;The Disease of Love&quot;), released in 1973. It is certainly Michel Sardou&#x27;s most famous song and stayed at the top of the charts for 11 weeks. Michel drew his inspiration for this song from Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon. A few bars from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; can also be heard in the song.
* &quot;Le France&quot; (&quot;SS France&quot;), released in 1975. Sardou resents the selling of the liner SS &quot;France&quot; by the President of France Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. A very controversial song, it was welcomed by the French Communist Party despite their view of Sardou as being a reactionary due to other songs of his.
* &quot;Être une femme&quot; (&quot;Being a woman&quot;), released in 1981. A satirical view on the evolution of women&#x27;s social status. Sardou makes a list of different jobs expected to be occupied by women (police officer, whore, President of France...) but specifies that whatever they do, they still retain their femininity.
* &quot;Les lacs du Connemara&quot; (&quot;The Lakes of Connemara&quot;), released in 1981. A lyrical evocation of Ireland and another one of his most popular songs, it is very often sung at the end of French student parties and at weddings in France or in Belgium. The song also has a tourism impact, with an estimated 350,000 additional visits to Connemara. Kylemore Abbey, the first tourist attraction in the region, has 20% French visitors, and guided tours are offered in this language. Of the 350,000 French who visit Ireland annually, more than half go to Connemara.
* &quot;Musulmanes&quot; (&quot;Muslim women&quot;), released in 1986. Sardou casts a pessimistic gaze on the status of women in Arabic countries. The song received, in 1987, the Music Victory for the best song of the year.
* &quot;La rivière de notre enfance&quot; (&quot;The River of our childhood&quot;), released in 2004. Performed in duet with the Canadian singer Garou, the song nostalgically evokes the traces of our childhood which persist in our lives. This song, extracted from his album &quot;Du plaisir&quot;, also marked his comeback after three years of inactivity.

=== Collaborations and appearances ===
*1980: Musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot;
*1989: &quot;Pour toi Arménie&quot;, collective charity song headed by Charles Aznavour
*2000: &quot;Happy Birthday Live – Parc de Sceaux 15 June 2000&quot;, in duet with Johnny Hallyday on &quot;Quelque chose de Tennessee&quot;

<text>Dame Jacqueline Wilson (&#x27;Aitken; born 17 December 1945) is an English novelist known for her popular children&#x27;s literature. Her novels have been notable for tackling realistic topics such as adoption and divorce without alienating her large readership. Since her debut novel in 1969, Wilson has written more than 100 books.
==Early life==
Jacqueline Aitken was born in Bath, Somerset, on 17 December 1945. Her father, Harry, was a civil servant and her mother, Margaret &quot;Biddy&quot; (née Clibbens), was an antiques dealer. She particularly enjoyed books by Noel Streatfeild, as well as American classics like &quot;Little Women&quot; and &quot;What Katy Did&quot;. At the age of nine, she wrote her first &quot;book&quot;, &quot;Meet the Maggots&quot;, which was 21 pages long. Wilson was given the nickname Jacky Daydream at school, which she later used as the title of her autobiography, which tells of her life as a primary school-aged child.

Wilson attended Coombe Girls&#x27; School in Surrey and Carshalton Technical College. After leaving school at age 16, she began training as a secretary but then applied to work with the Dundee-based publishing company DC Thomson on a new girls&#x27; magazine, &quot;Jackie&quot;.

==Career==

When Wilson began to focus on writing, she completed several crime fiction novels before dedicating herself to children&#x27;s books. At the age of 40, she took A-level English and earned a grade A. She had mixed success with about 40 books before the breakthrough to fame in 1991 with &quot;The Story of Tracy Beaker&quot;, published by Doubleday.

As her children&#x27;s novels frequently feature themes of adoption, divorce and mental illness, they tend to attract controversy, yet are well loved by children and adults alike.

=== University of Roehampton and charity work ===
In June 2013, Wilson was appointed a professorial fellow of the University of Roehampton, and a Pro-Chancellor. In February 2014, it was announced that she would be appointed Chancellor of the university (its honorary figurehead) from August 2014. She was reappointed in 2017 for a further three years. She teaches modules in both the Children&#x27;s Literature and Creative Writing master&#x27;s degree (MA) programmes offered by the university. She concluded her term as Chancellor in August 2020.

Wilson is patron of the charity Momentum in Kingston upon Thames, south London, which helps children undergoing treatment for cancer (and their families), and also a patron of the Letterbox Club, a BookTrust initiative. Until she moved away from Kingston-upon-Thames she was a patron of the Friends of Richmond Park.

==Reception==
In The Big Read, a 2003 poll conducted by the BBC, four of Wilson&#x27;s books were ranked among the 100 most popular books in the UK: &quot;Double Act&quot;, &quot;Girls In Love&quot;, &quot;Vicky Angel&quot;, and &quot;The Story of Tracy Beaker&quot;. Fourteen books by Wilson ranked in the top 200. In 2002, she replaced Catherine Cookson as the most borrowed author in Britain&#x27;s libraries, a position she retained until being overtaken by James Patterson in 2008.

==Accolades==
For her work, Wilson has won many awards including the Smarties Prize and the Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a book award judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers. &quot;The Illustrated Mum&quot; (1999) won the annual Guardian Prize and the annual British Book Award for Children&#x27;s Book of the Year; it also made the 1999 Whitbread Awards shortlist. &quot;The Story of Tracy Beaker&quot; won the 2002 Blue Peter People&#x27;s Choice Award, and &quot;Girls in Tears&quot; was the Children&#x27;s Book of the Year at the 2003 British Book Awards. Two of her books were &quot;Highly Commended&quot; runners-up for the annual Carnegie Medal: &quot;The Story of Tracy Beaker&quot; (1991) and &quot;Double Act&quot; (1995).

In June 2002, Wilson was appointed an OBE for services to literacy in schools and from 2005 to 2007 she served as the fourth Children&#x27;s Laureate. In that role, Wilson urged parents and carers to continue reading aloud to children long after they are able to read for themselves. She also campaigned to make more books available for blind people and campaigned against cutbacks in children&#x27;s television drama.

In October 2005, she received an honorary degree from the University of Winchester in recognition of her achievements in and on behalf of children&#x27;s literature. In July 2007, the University of Roehampton awarded her an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor of Letters) in recognition of her achievements in and on behalf of children&#x27;s literature. She has also received honorary degrees from the University of Dundee, the University of Bath and Kingston University.

In the 2008 New Year Honours, Wilson was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). In July 2012, Dame Jacqueline was also elected an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In 2017, Wilson received the Special Award at the BAFTA Children&#x27;s Awards. In the 2025 new years honours, Wilson was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire

For her lifetime contribution as a children&#x27;s writer, Wilson was a UK nominee for the international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2014.

A lecture hall at Kingston University&#x27;s Penrhyn Road campus has been named after her.

==Works==
===Adaptations===
A dramatisation of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Double Act&quot;, written and directed by Vicky Ireland, was first performed at The Polka Theatre in Wimbledon, London from 30 January to 12 April 2003, and toured throughout the UK. The playscript was published by Collins Plays Plus. Ireland has also written dramatisations of &quot;The Lottie Project&quot; (performed at Polka Theatre and San Pol Theatre, Madrid), &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; and &quot;Secrets&quot;, which were also commissioned by the Polka Theatre, and a dramatisation of &quot;The Suitcase Kid&quot; which was performed at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond and later toured throughout the UK. The scripts for these plays were published by Nick Hern Books.

The following books by Wilson have been adapted for television:

<doc id="1144680" wikidata="Q7332501" url="?curid=1144680" title="Ride On (Christy Moore album)">
<text>Ride On is an album by Irish folk singer Christy Moore, released in 1984. Its title track remains one of his most popular songs. A number of songs relate the actions of those involved in political struggles, or those affected by those struggles; such as &quot;Viva la Quinte Brigada&quot; which is concerned with the Irish contingent amongst the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War; or &quot;El Salvador&quot; dealing with the civil war in that country in the 1980s. Other songs deal with Irish history – &quot;The City of Chicago&quot;, about emigration to America during the Irish famines of the late 1840s; &quot;Back Home in Derry&quot; written by Bobby Sands about the transportation to Australia of convicts; and &quot;Lisdoonvarna&quot; celebrating the Lisdoonvarna Music Festival that took place annually near that town until the early 1980s.

==Reception==

Since &quot;Ride On&quot; is widely accepted as a landmark Moore album, it has been available ever since its original release and is regarded as one of the best possible introductions to the artist. The title track was written by one of Ireland&#x27;s most famous songwriters, Jimmy MacCarthy, and many other artists have interpreted the song.

<text>James W. Walter, Jr. (born 1947) is an American venture capitalist and author. He is best known for sponsoring advertisements asking to reopen the investigation of the September 11, 2001 attacks and offering financial rewards to anyone that could prove the World Trade Center was destroyed without the use of explosives.

== Biography ==
Walter is the older of two sons of James W. Walter, Sr., a Tampa, Florida home builder and industrialist. He excelled at math and science in school, completing high school at the Asheville School in North Carolina, and was offered a Morehead scholarship to the University of North Carolina, but turned it down at his father&#x27;s urging in order to enter business school.

Walter earned a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of North Carolina in 1969, and worked in his father&#x27;s business for two years. His father&#x27;s political influence helped Walter join the Air Force Reserves to stay out of active combat in the Vietnam War; he earned an officer&#x27;s commission and served for four years.

After leaving Walter Industries, Walter lived in New York City, Hong Kong, and Tampa. He worked in a number of jobs and industries, including financial public relations in New York City, and founded several corporations.

On May 28, 1991, Walter and Jack Edwards co-wrote &quot;Banzai, You Bastards&quot; (), the story of Edwards&#x27;s abuse in a Japanese World War II prisoner-of-war camp.

When his father died in January 2000, Walter inherited a fortune reported between $7–14.3 million; he says $11 million. Much of that has been spent on his campaigns. He no longer receives a salary, but receives income from investments.

Since January 2005, Walter has been living in self-imposed exile in Vienna, Austria, after being attacked and threatened due to his campaign.

== Non-profit organizations ==

In the early 1990s, Walter used outside funding and US$3 million of his own money to found the &quot;Life Skills Foundation&quot;, an organization that taught skills and goal setting to Florida prison inmates. The project produced results, but was shut down after the governor cut state financial backing.

Walter is also the founder of &quot;Walden Three&quot;, a non-profit educational foundation in Santa Barbara, California that researches ideas for sustainable, environmentally friendly urban development. The foundation has developed a computer model for the ideal sustainable living, carfree and fossil fuel-free city or society that produces almost all of the consumables, durable goods, structures, mass transportation and social security needed by its citizens. The model uses rational-emotive therapy (REBT), developed by Dr. Albert Ellis. Walter considers Walden Three his &quot;day job&quot; when he is not involved with campaigning.

== Anti-war campaign ==
Walter had been opposed to the Vietnam War, a source of contention with his father, but had not used his money to act on his convictions. On February 27, 2003, Walter spent US$125,000 to take out a full-page advertisement in the &quot;New York Times&quot; attacking Secretary of State Colin Powell&#x27;s justification for the impending 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was headlined &quot;Powell Lied?&quot; describing Powell&#x27;s February 5, 2003 speech to the United Nations Security Council—the &quot;New York Times&quot; insisted on adding the question mark. Walter took out similar advertisements in English and Spanish in local newspapers in Santa Barbara, California, where he was living. His stance was unpopular; posters he attached to his house were torn down, and a rock was put through his car&#x27;s window. Walter did not repeat the advertisement.

Walter also created a &quot;Chicken-Hawk-In-Chief&quot; design mocking George W. Bush which he put on t-shirts, sweatshirts, and a full costume. In May 2004, a Williamstown, Vermont middle school student gained national attention when he wore the t-shirt and was required to cover parts of the design depicting Bush drinking and snorting cocaine. On August 30, 2006, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the school was wrong to censor the shirt, and on June 29, 2007, the US Supreme Court rejected an appeal, allowing that ruling to stand.

== Reopen 9/11 campaign ==
Walter began a series of advertisements about the September 11, 2001 attacks in October 2004, which included full-page ads in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, and 30 second cable television spots on CNN, Fox News, and ESPN. They implied that no plane flew into The Pentagon, and that 7 World Trade Center was brought down by internal explosives. They called for a new investigation into what happened on September 11, and referred viewers to the website reopen911.org. In conjunction with the campaign, Walter sponsored an October 2004 Zogby poll, which found that 66% of New York City residents wanted a fuller investigation of the events of September 11.

Walter&#x27;s theory is that the hijacked planes were replaced by remote controlled drones that were crashed into the World Trade Center and Pentagon, while the buildings were brought down by preset explosives, to create a pretext for the war in Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq. At the web site, Walter offered a US$10,000 reward for a mathematical proof of how the World Trade Center buildings collapsed from the fire and impact, the way the 9/11 Commission said. By 2005, the reward had grown to $1,000,000 for proof that explosives were not used in the collapse of the World Trade Center.

On November 10, and November 11, 2004, Walter appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;, where he debated journalist Gerald Posner about the claims made by the campaign. On May 9, 2005, Walter was featured on the &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot; episode of Showtime cable television program &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;,

As of December 2004, Walter estimated the total cost of the campaign at more than $3 million; by December 2005 it rose to $5.5 million.

In May 2005, Walter financed European tours of speaking engagements for William Rodriguez
and his lawyer in the Rodriguez v. Bush lawsuit, Philip Berg. Rodriguez claims that he saved hundreds of people in the World Trade Center who were trapped behind locked fire escape doors.

In 2006, Walter traveled to Malaysia with Rodriguez, appearing at a conference with Michael Collins Piper. Rodriguez and Walter also traveled to Venezuela.

=== &quot;Confronting the Evidence&quot; ===
Walter produced a video documentary called &quot;Confronting the Evidence&quot; in 2005 and distributed over 300,000 free copies on DVD, including one to every household in Tony Blair&#x27;s Sedgefield constituency. &quot;Confronting the Evidence&quot; was broadcast on Italian Rai Tre television on September 24, 2006, at 9:00 p.m., during the &quot;Report&quot; program.

<doc id="1144695" wikidata="Q8025516" url="?curid=1144695" title="Winmalee, New South Wales">
<text>Winmalee is a town in New South Wales, Australia. Winmalee is located 77 kilometres west of the Sydney CBD, in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. At the , Winmalee had a population of 6,593.

Originally known as North Springwood, Winmalee was officially established in 1972. Springwood is historically significant as the first European settlement in the Blue Mountains. Winmalee is surrounded by Blue Mountains National Park. This National Park is on the World Heritage List and is known as the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site. The Blue Mountains area is unofficially known as &quot;The City Within a World Heritage National Park&quot;. Winmalee extends from Birdwood Avenue and Paulwood Avenue to Coramandel Avenue and east to a point part-way along Singles Ridge Road.

==History==
It is commonly believed that Winmalee is an Aboriginal word for &quot;north&quot;. But, as Aboriginal cultures did not use north, south, east or west, this is doubtful. It is more likely a corruption of the word &quot;Wimlah&quot;, the name of one of the Three Sisters, a rock formation 35 km to the west. The name was coined by a 14-year-old, who won a competition to find a name for North Springwood when the Geographical Names Board wanted to remove the compass prefixes from the names of towns and suburbs of New South Wales.

===Aboriginal heritage===
The area now officially known as Winmalee was once inhabited by Aboriginal Australians known as the Dharug tribe. This was a nomadic tribe which inhabited much of the Lower Blue Mountains until European colonisation and settlement. The dialect spoken by the tribe is known as the Dharug language. Current figures place the date of this settlement as beginning up to 50,000 years ago.

Except for a small number of descendants there are no members of the Dharug tribe now living in the area. The majority of this group were thought to have moved northward in the Blue Mountains and to have merged with the Gundungurra tribe. Others are thought to have been wiped out during European exploration and settlement. Archaeological evidence from the aboriginal inhabitants is common throughout Winmalee and includes several open sites and occupation shelters.

===European settlement===
In 1970, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales suggested that the area which had been unofficially known as &#x27;North Springwood&#x27; be made an independent suburb of the Blue Mountains and renamed &#x27;White Cross&#x27; because of the rapidly increasing population growth of Springwood. However residents of the area objected to the name &#x27;White Cross&#x27;.

In 1971, the Department of Education selected &quot;Winmalee&quot; as the name for a new school in the area. Though the residents of the area approved this as the name for the proposed school they rejected it as a name for the suburb. The name Winmalee was chosen by the Department of Education as the result of a competition that had been organised amongst the local people. Terry Macauley, who was to be one of the school&#x27;s original primary students, suggested the name &quot;Winmalee&quot;, a supposed Aboriginal word for North. The word was in fact never used by the Dharug people in relation to the area, but is instead a reference to its previous unofficial name.

Winmalee was finally officially established as an independent town on 28 April 1972 after the Minister for Lands, Tom Lewis MLA announced the suburb&#x27;s independence from Springwood and approved the name Winmalee despite objections from residents.

=== October 2013 bushfires ===
The town, the nearby village of Yellow Rock and a small part of the adjacent town of Springwood were badly affected by a bushfire which started on 17 October 2013. 196 residential properties were destroyed, and 109 damaged. 40 homes were destroyed on Buena Vista Road in Winmalee alone.

==Schools==

===High schools===
*The first High School established in the Winmalee area was St Columba&#x27;s High School. Originally a Catholic seminary, it was re-established as a high school in 1979, but did not cater for years 11 and 12 until 1993. The school and its grounds are some of the oldest forms of architecture in the area. The St Columbas property is one of the largest property holdings in the Blue Mountains and is rich in native flora and fauna. The whole of the St Columbas property is a Heritage property. St Columba&#x27;s High School established the first Japanese sister school agreement in the Blue Mountains with Hokusetsu Sanda Senior High School in Sanda, Hyōgo.
* Winmalee High School was the first high school developed after the suburb was named Winmalee and had established independence. It was officially established in 1985. Winmalee High has Sister School agreements with Arima Senior High School in Sanda City, Japan, Aurora College in Invercargill, New Zealand and Hillcrest School in Birmingham, UK

===Primary schools===

<doc id="1144697" wikidata="Q61552" url="?curid=1144697" title="Walter Gotell">
<text>Walter Jack Gotell (born Walter Jacques Goettel; 15 March 1924 – 5 May 1997) was a German-British actor. He was well known for his role as General Gogol, head of the KGB, in the Roger Moore era of the James Bond film series as well as having played the role of Morzeny, a villain, in &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;. He also appeared as Gogol in the final part of &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), Timothy Dalton&#x27;s debut Bond film.

==Early life==
Gotell was born Walter Jacques Goettel in Bonn in 1924, to Jewish parents Margarete Wilhelmine (née Cohn) and Jakob Goettel. He was raised mainly in Berlin. Due to rising antisemitism and the growing influence of Nazism, Gotell and his family immigrated to the United Kingdom in 1938, and he was naturalised as a British citizen in 1948. 

Gotell became interested in acting during secondary school, and he began acting in repertory theatre as a teeanger.

==Career==
Due to a shortage of young actors during World War II, Gotell began working in films starting in 1942. His bilingualism saw him cast as Nazi German villains and military men, such as in &quot;We Dive at Dawn&quot; (1943).

He began to have more established roles by the early 1950s, appearing in &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), &quot;The Red Beret&quot; (1953) for Albert R. Broccoli, &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (1958), &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962), &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965), &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1977), &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978) and &quot;Cuba&quot; (1979).

His first role in the James Bond film series was in 1963, when he played the henchman Morzeny in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. From the late 1970s, he played the recurring role of KGB General Anatol Gogol in the series, beginning with &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977). Gotell gained the role of Gogol because of his resemblance to the former head of Soviet secret police Lavrentiy Beria. The character returned in &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987). As the Cold War neared its end, the role of leader of the KGB was seen to change attitudes to the West – from direct competitor to collaborator. Gotell is one of a few actors to have played a villain and a Bond ally in the film series (others being Charles Gray, Richard Kiel and Joe Don Baker).

Throughout his career, Gotell also made numerous guest appearances in television series including &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Airline&quot;, &quot;Airwolf&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot; among others. He played Chief Constable Cullen in &quot;Softly, Softly: Task Force&quot; (1969–75). Other television roles included that of Sam Baker, a KGB agent in the hard-hitting British police drama &quot;The Professionals (1978) – &quot; the episode titled &quot;The Female Factor&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gotell was married to actress Yvonne Hills from 1958, until her death in 1974. They had one daughter, Carol, born in 1960. Gotell remarried, to Celeste F. Mitchell, in 1974.

Gotell was a businessman as well as an actor, and used his acting salaries to fund his business interests. He managed several engineering firms, and he owned a farm in Ireland.

== Death ==
Gotell died on 5 May 1997, at the age of 73.

<text>The Square Club for writers was a monthly dining club that met in London, from 1908/9 to about 1913/4, and included many of the established younger-generation authors. The founders included Edward Garnett, G. K. Chesterton and Conal O&#x27;Riordan. It was just one of a number of similar London groups (Garnett had another Soho circle that was distinct); it was perhaps the most substantial such grouping of its time, with a concentration of those enjoying professional success. The name was for Mr. Square, the philosopher character in Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot;.

Others who participated included J. D. Beresford, Walter de la Mare, John Galsworthy, W. H. Hudson, Roger Ingpen, Edgar Jepson, Arthur Machen, John Masefield, and Edward Thomas. Ezra Pound on arriving in London found it easy to make contacts through the club, but less easy to convince those there through his flamboyance. Jepson introduced Ford Madox Ford.

<text>King Chaekgye (died 298, r. 286–298) was the ninth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
He was the eldest son of King Goi. He became king upon Goi&#x27;s death in 286 which was the 53rd year of his reign. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that &quot;his stature was tall and great, and he was spirited and heroic&quot;.

==Reign==
His wife, whose name is recorded as Bogwa (), was a daughter of the governor of Daifang commandery. This marital alliance contributed to friction between the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo and Baekje, after Goguryeo attacked Daifang in 286 and Chaekgye sent troops to Daifang&#x27;s aid. Chaekgye fortified the Wiryeseong, Acha Mountain Fortress and Sa-seong to defend the Han River valley against expected retaliation.

In 298, Baekje was invaded by Maek-in (맥인, 貊人, probably referring to Dongye) and the Lelang commandery, and Chaekgye was killed.

Samguk sagi:
&quot;&quot;The King conscribed adult males to repair the fortress of Wirye. Goguryeo attacked Daifang. Daifang sought help from us. Previously, the king had married the daughter of the Daifang, Bogwa, and made her his concubine. Therefore he said, &quot;Daifang is the country of my relatives, how can I not hearken this summons?&quot; Then he led a force out to rescue them. Goguryeo resented this, and the king feared a reprisal attack, and so had the fortresses of Acha and Saseong repaired and provisioned&quot;.&quot;
* 287 AD, spring, first month. The king visited Dongmyeong shrine.
* 298 AD, autumn, ninth month. People from Han and Yemaek invaded. The king led a force to defend, and our enemies killed him.

==Family==
* Father: Goi of Baekje
* Mother: daughter of the Governor of Daifang commandery.
** Queen: Lady Bogwa () – daughter of the Governor of Daifang commandery.
*** Son: Buyeo Bunseo (扶餘汾西, ?–304) – 10th King of Baekje, Bunseo of Baekje.

<text>The Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe (; &quot;European Music Hall&quot;; formerly the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon ; &quot;Music Hall&quot;) is one of France&#x27;s six national theatres. It is located at 2 rue Corneille in the 6th arrondissement of Paris on the left bank of the Seine, next to the Luxembourg Garden and the Luxembourg Palace, which houses the Senate.

==First theatre==
The original building, the Salle du Faubourg Saint-Germain, was constructed for the Théâtre Français between 1779 and 1782 to a Neoclassical design by Charles De Wailly and Marie-Joseph Peyre. The site was in the garden of the former Hôtel de Condé. The new theatre was inaugurated by Marie-Antoinette on April 9, 1782. It was there that Beaumarchais&#x27; play &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; was premiered two years later. On April 27, 1791, during the Revolution, the company split. The players sympathetic to the crown remained in the theatre in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. They were arrested and incarcerated on the night of September 3, 1793, but were allowed to return a year later. In 1797, the theater was remodeled by the architect Jean-François Leclerc and became known as the Odéon, but it was destroyed by a fire on March 18, 1799.

==Second theatre==
An 1808 reconstruction of the theater designed by Jean Chalgrin (architect of the Arc de Triomphe) was officially named the Théâtre de l&#x27;Impératrice, but everyone still called it the Odéon. It burned down in 1818.

==Third theatre==
The third and present structure, designed by Pierre Thomas Baraguay, was opened in September 1819. In 1990, the theater was given the sobriquet &#x27;Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe&#x27;. It is a member theater of the Union of the Theatres of Europe.
==Access==

The Line 4 and Line 10 serves Odéon station.

<doc id="1144717" wikidata="Q392228" url="?curid=1144717" title="Speaker of the Parliament of Finland">
<text>The speaker of the Parliament of Finland (Finnish &quot;eduskunnan puhemies&quot;, Swedish &quot;riksdagens talman&quot;), along with two deputy speakers, is elected by Parliament during the first plenary session each year. Speakers are chosen for a year at a time. In addition to their preparing the work in plenary sessions the speakers also play a key role in Parliament&#x27;s international co-operation, which includes visits by speakers and international delegations as well as participation in numerous interparliamentary organisations.

The speaker and two deputy speakers are elected by parliament from among its members by secret ballot. After the election the speaker and deputy speakers each make the following solemn affirmation before Parliament:

:&quot;I, ..., affirm that in my office as speaker I will to the best of my ability defend the rights of the people, parliament and the government of Finland according to the Constitution.&quot;

Formally, the speaker ranks second in the protocol, after the president of Finland and before the prime minister of Finland. The speaker is the chairman of the parliament, who grants the floor for speeches and replies, makes voting proposals and decides on the final order of business. An interim speaker is elected for the duration of government formation talks. The speaker&#x27;s duties are defined in the Constitution of Finland and the parliament&#x27;s rules of procedure.

The title &quot;puhemies&quot; or &quot;talman&quot; has, both in Finnish and Swedish, the literal meaning &#x27;spokesman&#x27;, which has caused mild controversies in terms of sexism in language. However, according to official language authorities, the title is not easy to change to a more gender-neutral alternative due to its &quot;strong connection to the institution and history of the Parliament&quot;.

If there is a tie in the Speaker&#x27;s Council the speaker is given a tie-breaking vote.

<doc id="1144728" wikidata="Q3247828" url="?curid=1144728" title="Somerfield">
<text>Somerfield ( ) was a chain of small to medium-sized supermarkets operating in the United Kingdom. The business started life in the 19th century as grocers J. H. Mills, and after a series of buyouts and mergers, the company became known as Gateway. A major rebranding to the created Somerfield brand started in 1990, and in 1998 the company purchased the Kwik Save chain of discount food stores. The company was taken over by the Co-operative Group on 2 March 2009 in a £1.57 billion deal, creating the UK&#x27;s fifth-largest food retailer. The Somerfield name was replaced by the Co-operative brand in a rolling programme of store conversions ending in summer 2011.

== Gateway history==
===The early years===
The company had its origins in a Bristol-based grocer known as J.H. Mills which was founded in 1875 and which developed a self-service supermarket chain named Gateway Foodmarkets in 1960. During the early 1970s, Gateway operated primarily in the southwest of England with a few stores elsewhere. Ford and Lock stores and S&amp;H Pink Stamp acquisitions took place during the period when loyalty stamps were prevalent and the first freezer centres were opened. Gateway Foodmarkets was taken over by Linfood Holdings, a consortium which already owned the Frank Dee Supermarkets which operated over the north and east of England. At the time, Frank Dee Supermarkets and the larger DEE Discount stores were a business larger than Gateway and had a chain of 79 supermarkets, in 1977. In 1983, Linfood Holdings was renamed the Dee Corporation. Initial plans were proposed to utilise the distribution depots on three main sites; the thriving Frank Dee&#x27;s purpose built facilities in Anlaby and Billingham, and the existing Gateway warehousing site in Bristol.

===Acquisitions===
Alec Monk, chief executive of the Dee Corporation, having escaped a takeover bid from Argyll Foods in 1981, decided to create his own supermarket empire. Three of the biggest acquisitions were of Key Markets Supermarkets from Fitch Lovell, International Stores, bought from British American Tobacco in 1984, and Fine Fare, bought from Associated British Foods the following year. The company also purchased the UK arm of the French retailer, Carrefour when the French retailer exited Britain in the late 1980s. By this time, the Dee Corporation had over 1,100 stores and nearly 12% of the market, not far behind Sainsbury&#x27;s and Tesco. Most of the Dee Corporation&#x27;s outlets were small, high-street stores. Monk argued that there was a future for well-run conventional supermarkets as well as the large out-of-town stores.

However, by 1987 the Dee Corporation ran into problems, mainly because of the difficulty of integrating so many disparate businesses. Some disposals were made in that year, including the Linfood wholesaling operation. In 1988, the Dee Corporation changed its name to the Gateway Corporation, and a new retailing chief was recruited from the US. Investors remained sceptical, and in 1989 the company was the subject of a £2bn takeover bid from a newly formed company, Isosceles; the deal was partly financed by a pre-arranged sale of 61 Gateway stores to Asda.

===Isosceles era===
When Isosceles, a newly created financial group led by David Smith and backed by several big investment institutions, bid successfully for Gateway in 1989 and took the company private, the plan was to restructure the business and refocus it on what were called &quot;middle ground&quot; outlets, falling between the larger out of town superstores and smaller, inner-city neighbourhood shops; the average size of the stores was between and . The promoters of the Isosceles bid believed that, after this disposal and extensive restructuring of the rest of the portfolio, Gateway could become a viable competitor; the intention was to re-float the company on the stock market within three to five years. However, the bid was highly leveraged, and it was not clear that the new company would be able to fund the necessary modernisation of the business.

Some of the planned disposals of non-core businesses took longer than expected to complete. Financial strains led to the enforced departure of David Smith and other executives in 1991.

==Somerfield history==

In the following year, a new chief executive, Bob Willett, was appointed and a decision was taken to rebrand the company&#x27;s operations as Somerfield after a successful pilot scheme in 1990 with a new store and the first Somerfield store in the country being built in Burnham on Sea, Somerset, and the company then built its success upon the new brand alongside the existing Gateway and Food Giant chains. A small number of stores were also relaunched under a new Food Giant discount brand, with the first store opening in Nottingham in 1991.

Two years later, a further chief executive, David Simons, was in the post. In May 1994, the company changed its name to Somerfield plc.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, the holding company almost collapsed in the 1990s under a &quot;mountain of debt&quot;. In 1996, Somerfield plc was floated on the stock market in an initial public offering, after the recovery had reached the point where flotation became feasible with a market value of around £600M, and the proceeds were used to repay banks that had lent to Isosceles. At the time of the flotation the company&#x27;s market share had fallen to 5.3%, its lowest level for two years, but Simons claimed that the company was now clearly positioned in the market, and that the business would benefit from what he saw as the trend back towards high-street shopping. The aim was to become the UK&#x27;s strongest neighbourhood food retailer.

Questions remained about whether, at a time of intense competition both from discounters and from the larger chains, Somerfield could generate adequate growth in sales and profits.

In 1997, the Somerfield website was launched, which gave customers access to viewing online content such as offers, services and recipes, as well as online shopping via the chain&#x27;s free Home Delivery service.

===Kwik Save purchase===
In 1998, the company took over the Kwik Save chain in a £473 million transaction. Although the deal was billed as a merger of equals, Somerfield investors owned 62.5% of the enlarged group.

Observers questioned whether putting together two very different businesses would solve either&#x27;s problems. The initial plan was to convert most of the Kwik Save stores to the Somerfield branding, but the group continued to suffer from a disparate store portfolio, the result of numerous ill-digested acquisitions by Kwik Save prior to the Somerfield takeover. At the end of 1999, Simons, facing strong criticism from the city, announced plans to sell a third of the company&#x27;s 1,400 stores. He admitted that the group had underestimated the difference between Somerfield and Kwik Save, and had failed to support and maintain the Kwik Save brand. A few months later Simons resigned.

The original plan to transfer all Kwik Save stores to the Somerfield branding was quickly abandoned after it became clear that many outlets were not suitable for conversion, either due to size or location. Also, the downmarket wooden shelving and poor quality fittings used by Kwik Save meant that every conversion required a full refurbishment of the store - simply changing the signage and uniforms would have risked dragging the carefully developed Somerfield brand downmarket. 

Instead, the larger Kwik Save stores were converted, some were sold or closed and the chain became a trading division of Somerfield Stores Ltd, sharing its supply chain and back office systems with Somerfield. For some years, the own brand products in Kwik Save stores were Somerfield, although this policy was reversed once it was decided to keep the brand.

Somerfield&#x27;s existing Food Giant discount supermarkets were rebranded as Kwik Save.

It was clear that more than a hundred Somerfield and Kwik Save stores were within a mile of each other and directly competing: also customers were switching from high street to out of town shopping.

===Somerfield Direct===
Somerfield launched a home shopping pilot in the Bristol area under the name Somerfield Direct in early 1999. As a call centre operated service, customers would telephone the company to order Somerfield produce, which would be delivered direct from the warehouse.
After the launch, Somerfield bought Supermarket Direct in April 1999 for £3.25 million to extend the range of Somerfield Direct, and Supermarket Direct partners Dominick Scott-Flanagan and David Noble joined the Somerfield Direct board. At the time, Somerfield Direct only covered the South West of England from its base in Bristol. With the incorporation of Supermarket Direct, Somerfield Direct extended its range to the London area.

While other home shopping services were providing internet ordering, at this point Somerfield Direct was a catalogue and call-centre operation, chief executive Simons expressing the view that &quot;Mrs Smith in Stockport is more likely to use a handy catalogue from her supermarket than surf the Net in search for Fido&#x27;s dog food&quot;. The operation launched internet ordering in July 1999, and was then rebranded as &quot;Somerfield 24-7&quot;. At its peak the home shopping division employed 225 staff and operated from three distribution centres.

However, Somerfield suffered large losses in 2000, its home shopping venture was described as an &quot;ill-fated foray&quot;, and development was halted that June.

===John von Spreckelsen===
John von Spreckelsen, former chief executive of convenience food retailer Budgens, was brought in as chairman in April 2000. The new strategy was to keep Somerfield and Kwik Save as separate businesses, while sharing common services in such areas as information technology and corporate finance. By mid-2002 – halfway through what was seen as a five-year recovery programme – the company announced a return to the black, and dividends were resumed after a two-year break, although the positioning issues remained unsolved.

Somerfield was the product of opportunistic acquisitions, driven more by financial engineering than by any conception of where the company should be positioned. The focus on medium-sized high street supermarkets was largely a matter of making the best of a very difficult job; the main problem, which had not been solved by the end of the 1980s, was to make some sense of the heterogeneous collection of stores which it had acquired through its numerous takeovers.

===New formats===

Somerfield changed its logo in 2002 from a rectangular shape to a more contemporary design and opened several new store formats, including Somerfield Essentials and Somerfield Market Fresh. It further changed its brand image by introducing newer own-brand lines including the premium &#x27;So Good&#x27; range, the low fat &#x27;Good Intentions&#x27;, and a new advertising strapline: &quot;Good Food Made Easy&quot;. This strapline later changed several times - see the list of slogans mentioned earlier on this page. A low-price own brand label called &#x27;Makes Sense&#x27; was introduced to compete with rival low-cost brands, such as Tesco Value. At some time in the mid-2000s, some stores started selling products labelled under the German-based Tchibo brand, however this ceased by 2009.

===Safeway Compact===

In October 2004, Somerfield acquired 114 Safeway Compact stores from Morrisons, which were subsequently re branded under the Somerfield name. This deal was referred to the Competition Commission. After completing its investigation, the commission instructed Somerfield to sell 12 stores. In September 2005, Somerfield announced its intention to appeal against the decision, a process delayed by a takeover bid for the chain. The Competition Appeal Tribunal upheld the commission&#x27;s decision in February 2006. Somerfield therefore had to proceed with sale of the 12 stores. However, the sale of Kwik Save in February 2006 is likely to have removed the potential clashes between some of the offending stores.

=== Acquired by private equity ===
Retail entrepreneurs John Lovering and Bob Mackenzie made two failed bids to take over the Company in 2003. Then in 2005, Icelandic venture capital group Baugur made an approach, while United Co-operatives and London &amp; Regional Properties also expressed an interest, but both groups dropped out of the running.

Then on 21 December 2005, Somerfield plc was acquired for £1.1 billion by a consortium consisting of Apax Partners, Barclays Capital and the Tchenguiz Family Trust, at which time the name of the group changed to Somerfield Ltd.

The aim of the new owners was to simplify the business and attract new customers. The first move was the end of the Saver Card loyalty scheme in May 2006 with promotional deals becoming available to all customers. A new point of sale was introduced to make promotions and price cuts more visible to customers. Somerfield&#x27;s three own-label brands were overhauled; the budget &#x27;Makes Sense&#x27; range became &#x27;Simply Value&#x27;, the low calories &#x27;Good Intentions&#x27; range became &#x27;Healthy Choice&#x27;, and the premium &#x27;So Good&#x27; range became &#x27;Best Ever!&#x27;. A new strapline &quot;Giving you what you want&quot; was introduced to reflect this.

===Kwik Save sale===

In 2005, Somerfield closed 22 of its 51 Scottish Kwik Save stores and rebranded the remainder under its own name, thus removing the Kwik Save brand from the marketplace north of the border.

After the group was taken over, it was reported that the new owners found the Kwik Save chain was losing £40m per year, effectively cancelling out around 40% of the profits generated by the Somerfield division. As a result, it increased the rate of converting stores from Kwik Save to Somerfield. On 27 February 2006, Somerfield Stores Ltd sold the Kwik Save brand and 171 stores to BTTF, an investment vehicle headed by Paul Niklas, for an undisclosed sum. Somerfield re-branded the 102 Kwik Save sites it had retained under its own name and a further 77 stores were sold to other retailers, thought to include Netto and Aldi, leaving the company to focus solely on the Somerfield brand.

Subsequent to the initial sale, a further 19 Kwik Save stores were acquired by BTTF, including some of those included in the Competition Commission investigation ruling into the Safeway Compact takeover.

===Store rationalisation===
In August 2006, a series of store closures was announced as Somerfield&#x27;s new owners continued their restructuring activity. Some of these were poorly performing Somerfield stores and some were former Kwik Save sites that had not proved successful after being converted to Somerfield stores in 2006.

Some stores were sold to other groups, including Sainsbury&#x27;s, which bought five stores, while others were closed completely.

In October 2006, it was revealed that 40 Somerfield stores, including many retained Kwik Save branches, had been sold. These stores were mainly under-performing converted Kwik Save stores.

In November 2006, the company also sold a further 12 stores to Marks &amp; Spencer to trade under the M&amp;S Simply Food brand. This deal included stores in Blackheath in south-east London, Broughty Ferry in Dundee, and Petersfield and Alton in Hampshire.

Having bought 140 Texaco petrol stations in 2007, Somerfield tripled the size of some of their shops, using a similar format to its convenience stores. Signage was replaced with the Somerfield brand.

===Takeover by the Co-operative Group===
On 16 July 2008, it was announced that Somerfield would be acquired by the Co-operative Group for £1.57 billion, subject to approval from the Office of Fair Trading.

The build-up to this announcement began in late 2007, when the parent private equity consortium, that had acquired Somerfield in December 2005, put the chain up for sale. News reports valued the chain at over £1.5 billion.

Somerfield appointed Citigroup to manage the sale, and a preference to sell as a going concern rather than on a piecemeal basis was reported. It emerged that four provisional bids were made. Only the Co-operative Group, the UK&#x27;s largest co-operative, publicly announced purchase talks, aiming to complete due diligence for the entire estate of 900 Somerfield stores in the third quarter, but would be expected to sell a minority of stores. On 24 June, a Thomson Reuters newswire reported sources indicating that the Co-operative Group&#x27;s acquisition of Somerfield could be finalised at the start of July, in a final deal worth £1.7 billion. Earlier in June, Morrisons confirmed that it was not bidding for Somerfield, but would consider the purchase of any stores that are sold after the acquisition. Newspaper sources said that other major supermarket chains are also interested in such purchases. In July 2008, the Co-operative Group announced a deal to purchase Somerfield for £1.57 billion, creating the fifth largest supermarket chain in the UK. It was confirmed on 20 October 2008 that the Office of Fair Trading had approved the sale of Somerfield under the condition that 133 stores must be sold. This process continued into 2009 with many stores changing ownership, for example to Lidl.

In February 2009, it was announced that The Co-operative Group planned to close the Somerfield head office in Bristol and relocate all operations to its existing head office in Manchester. The Co-operative said that it would try to relocate as many staff as possible to other areas of the business or to its head office in Manchester, to try to avoid redundancies. The takeover was officially completed on 2 March 2009. The conversion and rebranding of Somerfield stores into Co-op stores took just over two years and was completed by summer 2011.

===Legal case===
Somerfield entered into a contract with ParkingEye Ltd. for the operation of store car parks, allowing customers a period of free parking and allowing ParkingEye to levy charges and retain payments from customers who overstayed their permitted parking time. The contract was to operate for a minimum of 15 months but was terminated after 6 months, leaving ParkingEye (who had funded the provision of the parking monitoring system) short on revenue due to the curtailed payment period. Somerfield argued that some parts of the ParkingEye process were deceptive, in that in that they stated that customers owed money to ParkingEye when in fact they had breached their agreement on parking duration with Somerfield and their debt lay with Somerfield, and stated that Somerfield would be taking legal action, which was not the case. The supermarket sought to cancel the contract due to its illegality due to deception, but the Court of Appeal ruled in 2012 that the misrepresentations in ParkingEye&#x27;s process did not justify termination of the contract, noting that earlier action requesting ParkingEye to revise its debt material would have resolved the situation. There was some learning in this case, in that the court stated that the court reinforced long established legal authority for &quot;the justice of treating a party who deliberately sets out to break the law in a serious respect, such as overloading a vessel, differently from a party who breaks the law without meaning to do so or in a way which may be minor&quot;.

==Operations==
As an independent entity, Somerfield was the sixth largest food retailer in the UK, according to TNS Worldpanel, following the sale of the Kwik Save unit and the closure or sale of unprofitable stores, with 977 stores (as of January 2007). Also the fifth largest private company in the UK, Somerfield had a 3.8% share of the UK grocery market in 2007, down from 4.5% in 2006.

The five larger retailers &quot;(in descending order of size)&quot; were Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Morrisons and The Co-operative Group. The top four have specialities in larger superstores, while the Co-op has become the largest community retailer, with specialities in convenience stores and smaller supermarkets. At one point in early 2007, Somerfield was also briefly surpassed in size by Waitrose.
==References in popular culture==
The branch of Somerfield in Wells, Somerset, England had featured prominently in the film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007) and Somerfield branding was clearly visible. In the film the manager of the supermarket Simon Skinner, played by Timothy Dalton, is a charming but sinister individual. The film includes a gun battle scene in the supermarket between police and staff members in full Somerfield uniforms, and a scene involving hand-to-hand combat. Simon Skinner was also injured after tripping on a miniature Somerfield lorry in a model village, landing on the model church and getting severely injured in the throat. The Somerfield shop also appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;, during an interview between actor Simon Pegg and host Jeremy Clarkson. The reason the store was chosen was due to the director of the film Edgar Wright having formerly worked at the store. Wright also made an amateur film called &quot;Dead Right&quot; that had scenes in the same store which is featured on the bonus DVD editions of &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;. 

The gameshow &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; had the supermarket set modelled and furnished by Somerfield from 1995 to 1997.

A store under its Gateway name featured briefly in the 1990 Christmas Special of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; (&quot;Rodney Come Home&quot;), in which the store can be seen behind the main characters Del Boy and Uncle Albert as they travel up an escalator to reach the top floor of a shopping precinct, so Del Boy can sell a set of dolls that wet themselves and sing a lullaby in Chinese, while Albert acts as his &quot;Lookout&quot; (for police officers).

In the coming of age play and film &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; written by Jonathan Harvey, the main character Jamie asks Tony (the new-age lover of his mother Sandra) where they met, to which he responds &quot;Gateways&quot;.

Gateway was specifically mentioned by Victor Meldrew in &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; after the local newspaper erroneously reported that Victor had &#x27;gone to ground&#x27;, when in fact he had &#x27;gone to Gateway&#x27;. In one episode of the same show, a Gateway store can be seen in the background.

<text>The auramine–rhodamine stain (AR), also known as the &quot;Truant auramine–rhodamine stain&quot;, is a histological technique used to visualize acid-fast bacilli using fluorescence microscopy, notably species in the &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; genus. Acid-fast organisms display a reddish-yellow fluorescence. Although the auramine–rhodamine stain is not as specific for acid-fast organisms (e.g. &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; or &quot;Nocardia&quot;) as the Ziehl–Neelsen stain, it is more affordable and more sensitive, therefore it is often utilized as a screening tool.

AR stain is a mixture of auramine O and rhodamine B. It is carcinogenic.

<text>Aquarium furniture or aquarium decor refers to the various ornaments and functional items that support an aquarium.

==Interior decorations==

Ornamental aquarium furniture is used both for aesthetic reasons and to enrich the habitat and provide shelter for fish. Common types of aquarium furniture include artificial plants, caves, and themed decorations. Common tropes include treasure chests, shipwrecks, and vibrantly colored synthetic coral. Using ceramic objects as aquarium furniture is controversial to aquarists, as some types of ceramic glaze can leach heavy metals into aquarium water.

Examples of functional aquarium furniture include devices for removing algae from the glass (either a razor or a scouring pad, attached to the glass by a magnet), airstones, water filters, water heaters, and food dispensers.

==Exterior stands and cabinetry==

Aquarium furniture may also refer to an item of (regular) furniture that features an aquarium in its design. A stand or cabinet that supports the aquarium may be considered aquarium furniture. Also, many home reef aquariums canopies containing metal halide lights. 

Aquarium stands and canopies are often constructed to the same standards as high quality cabinetry. They can be custom built to not only support the tank itself, but to house control systems such as lights and pumps, and to provide storage for supplies.
