<text>The Gilded Palace of Sin is the debut studio album by American country rock band The Flying Burrito Brothers, released on February 6, 1969, by A&amp;M Records. It continued Gram Parsons&#x27; and Chris Hillman&#x27;s work in modern country music, fusing traditional styles such as folk and country with other forms of popular music including gospel, soul, and psychedelic rock.

Although it was not a commercial success, peaking at #164 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; has been widely regarded as an important album the development of 1970s rock. It was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). It is also listed at number 192 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in the 2012 edition and number 462 in the 2020 edition, keeping the same position on the 2023 small revision.

==Background==
After spearheading the Byrds&#x27; foray into country music with the influential &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album, Gram Parsons fell out with the band when he refused to accompany them on a tour of South Africa in 1968. Two months later bassist Chris Hillman left the Byrds as well and joined Parsons to form the Flying Burrito Brothers. As stated in the documentary &quot;Beyond Nashville&quot;, &quot;Gram Parsons was passionate about country music&#x27;s simple poetry. He was equally passionate about rock music. At a time when they were poles apart, he alone thought they belonged together.&quot;

==Recording and composition==
&quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; was recorded at A&amp;M Studios in Hollywood and produced by Larry Marks with Henry Lewy engineering. The sessions featured a variety of drummers. With harmonies that reveal the influences of the Everly Brothers and the Louvin Brothers, the songs on the Burritos&#x27; debut attempt to marry country music with the soul sound associated with Otis Redding&#x27;s Stax-Volt label and singers like Percy Sledge.

Another significant characteristic of the album is &quot;Sneaky&quot; Pete Kleinow&#x27;s unorthodox steel guitar playing, which provides an almost continuous commentary throughout some of the songs. As guitarist Bernie Leadon (who wasn&#x27;t a member of the band yet when this LP was recorded and released) explains to Meyer in &quot;Twenty Thousand Roads&quot;, &quot;Sneaky uniquely played an eight-string Fender cable pull steel tuned to B6 instead of the more common C6. He played [a] usually more jazz or swing tuning in a style that most other players use an E9 tuning for. His rationale was: B is the &#x27;five chord,&#x27; or dominant chord, to the key of E. This resulted in absolutely-to-Pete steel licks. And no one else thinks like him anyway.&quot; Kleinow also utilized a fuzzbox and played the instrument through a rotating Hammond Leslie amplifier, adding a psychedelic touch to several songs.

Most of the songs were written by Parsons and Hillman at a house in the San Fernando Valley dubbed &quot;Burrito Manor.&quot; &quot;Sin City&quot;, co-written by Hillman and Parsons and called a &quot;loping lament&quot; and a &quot;cautionary dirge&quot;, mentions The Byrds&#x27;s manager Larry Spector (&quot;a gold plated door&quot;) and Robert F. Kennedy (&quot;tried to clean up this town&quot;). It may have been influenced by The Louvin Brothers. In the 2004 documentary &quot;Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel&quot;, Hillman recalls writing the song with Parsons: &quot;Gram was sleeping. I woke up and had this idea, &#x27;This old town&#x27;s filled with sin, it&#x27;ll swallow you in.&#x27; I got the first verse and most of the chorus and then I said, &#x27;Gram, get up! I got somethin&#x27; here.&#x27; And he got up and we wrote that song in about thirty minutes. It actually wrote itself.&quot; In the same documentary bassist Chris Etheridge adds, &quot;I told Gram I had a couple of old melodies from back when I was growin&#x27; up...I played &#x27;em for him and we wrote the two songs that day, the &quot;Hot Burrito #1&quot; and the &quot;Hot Burrito #2,&quot; and then that night went into the studio and cut &#x27;em.&quot; &quot;My Uncle&quot; and &quot;Hippie Boy&quot; address then-contemporary countercultural concerns: the draft and the 1968 Democratic National Convention riots. Parsons later explained to &quot;Fusion&quot; magazine, &quot;We kept saying we got to do a song called &#x27;Hippie Boy&#x27; about Chicago, and it&#x27;s got to be a narrative song, and Chris Hillman has to do it...It was the toughest challenge on the album.&quot; The two R&amp;B standards covered on the album, &quot;Dark End of the Street&quot; and &quot;Do Right Woman&quot;, are examples of a country-soul fusion that Parsons would often refer to as &quot;cosmic American music.&quot;
==Album artwork==
The album cover features the band in Nudie suits. Parsons had taken the band to designer Nudie Cohn to have custom sequin suits made for all the band members especially for the photo shoot, but Parsons&#x27; was most unusual, featuring a naked woman (rendered as an old-school sailor&#x27;s tattoo on each lapel), red poppies on the shoulders, deep-green marijuana leaves on the front, and embroidered Seconal and Tuinal pills scattered elsewhere. Parsons asked that a flaming red cross surrounded by radiating shafts of blue and gold light cover the back of the jacket. The suit now hangs in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Tom Wilkes, who was the head of the art department at A&amp;M at the time, explained to director Gandulf Hennig in 2004, &quot;We decided to take them out to the desert and do something kind of surreal with the Nudie suits. And they looked great anyway. They looked funky and kind of country western and kind of rock. I felt that look was great. They didn&#x27;t really need the Nudie suits.&quot; The album cover was shot by Barry Feinstein.

==Reception==
At the time of its release, John Firminger wrote in &quot;Country Music Review&quot; that the album &quot;quite clearly stands as a complete definition of the term country rock, using a heavy instrumental approach combining strong country roots.&quot; Allan Jones, writing in the influential British rock weekly &quot;NME&quot;, raved, &quot;Let me discourse on the sheer magnificence contained within the micro-grooves of &quot;Gilded Palace of Sin&quot;.&quot; In the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the album, Stanley Booth called it &quot;one of the best records of the year&quot; and the best, most personal music Parsons had ever done. When &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; asked Bob Dylan to name his favorite country-rock album, he answered, &quot;The Flying Burrito Brothers. Boy, I love them. Their record instantly knocked me out.&quot; The album has since become regarded as one of the most groundbreaking of the 1960s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it on their list of &quot;The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time&quot;, writing that &quot;in many ways, &quot;Gilded Palace&quot; picks up where the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; left off...Together, the mercurial Parsons and the levelheaded Hillman concocted a crazily coherent statement of irony-fueled hillbilly anthems, inventive covers and achingly beautiful two-part harmonies, all underscored by Sneaky Pete Kleinow&#x27;s radical pedal-steel guitar.&quot; In a 5 star review, AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming raved, &quot;...no one ever brought rock and country together quite like the Flying Burrito Brothers, and this album remains their greatest accomplishment.&quot; In his article &quot;The Lost Boy&quot;, John Harris of &quot;Mojo&quot; writes that the album &quot;remains an absolute delight, founded on the poetry that came from the juxtaposition of country music&#x27;s air of sincere honesty with songs that drew much of their inspiration from the synthetic expanse of Los Angeles.&quot;

==Influence==
Like &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; was not a commercial success. To date, the RIAA has not certified it gold. However, its impact on popular music has grown over the years, influencing, for example, the Eagles. During the 1980s, the New Traditionalist movement in mainstream country music was influenced by &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot;, with artists such as Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Alan Jackson, Clint Black and Randy Travis. Today, &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; continues to influence the alternative country movement, often referred to as &quot;alt-country.&quot; Bands like Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Son Volt, Whiskeytown, and the Jayhawks, as well as such musicians as Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris (Parsons&#x27; one-time singing partner), and Steve Earle all have recorded music that bears traces of &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot;. Non-country artists like Elvis Costello have cited the album as a particular favorite, with Costello covering several cuts during his career; similarly, Dinosaur Jr. have covered the song &quot;Hot Burrito #2&quot; on their album &quot;Green Mind&quot;. In the liner notes for the 1997 reissue, Sid Griffin wrote that while &quot;Gilded Palace&quot; only sold 50,000 copies, &quot;...like the first album by the Velvet Underground, it would seem everyone of those 50,000 went out and formed a band inspired by what they&#x27;d heard.&quot;

For years, the album was never reissued in its entirety on compact disc in the United States. However, in 2000 the complete album was reissued as part of a two-disc set, &quot;Hot Burritos! The Flying Burrito Brothers Anthology 1969–1972&quot;. In 2002, a new mastering was issued on a single-disc release &quot;Sin City: The Very Best of the Flying Burrito Brothers&quot;, which packaged &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; with its successor, &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot;, as well as a few outtakes from the same period.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 192 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list and dropping to 461 on the 2020/2023 revision. In 2013, the album was ranked number 99 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was included in the 2014 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;50 Rock Albums Every Country Fan Should Own&quot;. It was ranked number 620 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, 3rd Edition (2000).

==Reissues==
In early 2017, independent record label Intervention Records released a 180-gram vinyl reissue of &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot;. The reissue was remastered by Kevin Gray, using a 1/2&quot; safety copy of the original master tapes and includes an &quot;old-style&quot; jacket featuring the original album artwork printed by Stoughton Printing. In late 2017, it was reissued on hybrid SACD by Intervention Records. A standard reissue of the album on vinyl was released worldwide on January 29, 2021.

<doc id="1138497" wikidata="Q848793" url="?curid=1138497" title="Hangu Pass">
<text>Hangu Pass or Hanguguan is a pass separating the upper Yellow River and Wei valleys—the cradle of Chinese civilization and seat of its longtime capital Xi&#x27;an—from the fertile North China Plain. It lies on the south bank of the Yellow River just east of its eastward bend out of the Ordos Loop at Tong Pass in Shaanxi. It was the site of many battles during the Warring States and early imperial eras, when it was the chokepoint shielding Qin, Guanzhong, or Luoyang from outside attack. The term Hangu Pass refers to two locations: the Qin dynasty Hangu Pass in Hanguguan Town, Lingbao county, Sanmenxia city, Henan and secondly, the Han dynasty Hangu Pass in Xin’an county, Luoyang city, Henan. In 2014, the archeological site was recognized by UNESCO as part of the “Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang&#x27;an-Tianshan Corridor” World Heritage Site.

==History==

Chinese legend states that Lao-tzu wrote his &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; at the insistence of Yinxi, an astrologer and the guard at Hangu Pass, before leaving for the west.

The state of Qin fortified the pass in 361BC as its eastern border, protecting access to their homeland from the armies of the other Warring States competing to succeed the Zhou. It continued to protect the Guanzhong area of the Qin and Western Han empires. Under the Eastern Han that succeeded Wang Mang&#x27;s &quot;Xin dynasty&quot;, its fortifications protected the capital Luoyang in the other direction, staving off attacks coming from the west and northwest.

After the fall of the Han and rise of the Three Kingdoms, the Hangu Pass lost most of its importance as the primary fortifications moved a little west to Tong Pass.

== Discovery of Han dynasty Hangu Pass site ==
Between 2012 and 2013 a team from the Luoyang Cultural Relics and Archaeological Institution conducted an archaeological excavation at the site in Xin&#x27;an, Luoyang, on an area of more than 3,000 square meters. This excavation brought several roads, platforms and walls to light.
Today, the archaeological site of the Hangu Pass in Xin’an is a museum park.
== Hangu Pass in fiction ==
In the manga series &quot;Kingdom&quot; by Yasuhisa Hara, the Hangu Pass was the last chokepoint that Li Mu and his Coalition Army needed to overcome in order to defeat Qin. Their attacks were repelled with great losses, forcing Li Mu to make a decision of attacking Xianyang via Zui.

<text>Region 2 was an administrative district in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, from 2000 to 2006. It is known as the Midrand region. It bordered Region 3 (Sandton), Region 7 (Modderfontein), and Region 1 (Diepsloot). The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.

The development of Region 2 has traditionally centred on the N1, the main highway that links Johannesburg to Pretoria to the north. Housing in Region 2 is mostly formal with many affluent suburbs. Midrand has not had much significant development, so a lot of open space remains. Region 2 currently has a population of 200,000. While many people in Region 2 are wealthy, the vast majority of residents are poor: 36% earn no reported income at all.

<doc id="1138504" wikidata="Q7101231" url="?curid=1138504" title="Oregon Hill">
<text>Oregon Hill is a historic working-class neighborhood in Richmond, Virginia. Oregon Hill overlooks the James River and Belle Isle, and provides access to Hollywood Cemetery. Due to the neighborhood&#x27;s proximity to the Monroe Park Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University, the neighborhood is sometimes referred to as a student quarter because of its high college student population.

William Byrd III established a rural estate on the property in 1758. Wealthy heiress Grace Arents helped build many institutions to serve the community.

==History==
In 1758, William Byrd III built his country house Belvidere on this hill, with views of the James River as well as Church Hill (Richmond, Virginia) and Shockoe Hill. Fire destroyed the house and gardens about a century later, by which time the neighborhood had transformed from an agricultural to industrial one. Construction of the James River and Kanawha Canal beginning in 1785 brought not only boatman, but merchants, millers and iron workers to the neighborhood.

Important Quakers who lived in the Oregon Hill neighborhood included Robert Pleasants, and later Samuel Pleasants Parsons, who became superintendent of the Virginia Penitentiary, which once stood on Belvidere Street. As General Superintendent of the canal company, Parsons oversaw its expansion to Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1817, the Harvie family, which owned most of the neighborhood, subdivided it into lots, which were sold to blacks as well as whites. The Baker House, built by a &quot;free person of color&quot; on Belvidere Street , was moved in the 1920s to 617 Cherry Street. The neighborhood&#x27;s name refers to quips that employees moving there to be close to their workplace might as well be moving westward to Oregon. The Tredegar Iron Works and Albemarle Paper Company became major employers by the 1850s. In 1849, the Hollywood Cemetery was developed from what had been known as Harvie&#x27;s Woods at the edge of the neighborhood.

Most early buildings in the current historic district date from industrial expansion during Reconstruction following the Civil War, when state office buildings also replaced some single-family housing. Richmond annexed the neighborhood in 1869. The oldest surviving church building is the Pine Street Baptist Church, built in 1886. The city acquired the land which became Riverside Park, delimiting the neighborhood&#x27;s southern edge, in 1889. The park keeper&#x27;s house dates from 1900, but many of the walkways and other buildings were constructed by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. The park sustained substantial damage from tropical storm Gaston in 2004. In the early 1940s, the neighborhood saw a large fluxation of Jewish immigrants fleeing Eastern Europe. The population was extrapolated in the 1960s due to segregation laws.

St. Andrew&#x27;s Church started as a Sunday school mission of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in 1873. A brick structure replaced the original wood-frame building in 1901. In 1894, Richmond philanthropist Grace Arents (niece of Lewis Ginter) established a kindergarten, which later expanded into St. Andrews School, and ultimately the St. Andrew&#x27;s Church Complex. Around the same time, Sadie Cabaniss, superintendent of the nursing school at Old Dominion Hospital (now VCU School of Nursing), founded the Nurse&#x27;s Settlement House, now known as the William Byrd Community House. All three continue to the current day, with separate but complementary missions among the neighborhood&#x27;s (and metropolitan area&#x27;s) working families.

==Today==
Oregon Hill is currently bordered by Cary St. to the north, Belvidere St. to the east, The James River and Canal to the south, and by the Hollywood cemetery and Linden St. to the west. It is located only a few blocks south of Virginia Commonwealth University. This makes it a popular place for students to rent houses or apartments. It is also known as a white working-class enclave. Recently, there has been much development throughout Oregon Hill. This development has occurred in several forms. Infill projects have erected houses in lots that were previously vacant due to fires or other demolition. Many old buildings have either been torn down and replaced with townhouses, or renovated. A new townhouse complex called The Overlook was completed in the late 2010&#x27;s and was constructed on the blocks overlooking the James River. Possibly one of the most important sites in this neighborhood is Moss&#x27;s House. The only restaurant in Oregon Hill is L&#x27;opossum, which Tom Hanks has visited. Up until the 1990s, original housing stock stood on and was inhabited in this area. It was demolished and the land stood vacant after 1997, during which time it was used as a riverside park overlooking the James. The complete demolition of all the houses on these 3 blocks was a source of bitter contention between the neighborhood and the Ethyl Corporation, which owned the land. Some original houses still look over the river to the west of this development. Due to the major development, and the accompanying rise in property taxes and general cost of living, many families who have lived in Oregon Hill for generations are selling their homes or finding their rents unaffordable.

==Notable residents==
*Boris Kodjoe, actor, lived there while attending Virginia Commonwealth University
*Members of the heavy metal band Lamb of God lived in the neighborhood while attending Virginia Commonwealth University, playing their earliest shows in basements throughout Oregon Hill.
*Caressa Cameron, 2010 Miss America
*Donnie Corker, cross-dresser, entertainer, entrepreneur and activist
*Christopher Poole, founder of 4chan, lived in the neighborhood while attending Virginia Commonwealth University
*Troy Daniels, shooting guard for the Charlotte Hornets, briefly lived in the neighborhood while playing for the VCU Rams men&#x27;s basketball team in 2010
*Jay Pharoah, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member, while attending VCU
*David Baldacci, best-selling novelist
*Mary Jackson, leader of the 1863 Richmond Bread Riot

==In popular culture==

&quot;Oregon Hill&quot; is the first book of Howard Owen&#x27;s Willie Black mystery series. As the &quot;New York Times Sunday Book Review&quot; said, &quot;Owen has recruited his sick, sad and creatively crazy characters from a rough neighborhood cut off from the rest of the city when the expressway was built. If anyone is watching out for the forgotten citizens of Oregon Hill, it&#x27;s Willie, who grew up there and speaks the local language, a crisp and colorful urban idiom...&quot;

<text>The Lecythidaceae ( ) comprise a family of about 20 genera and 250–300 species of woody plants native to tropical South America, Africa (including Madagascar), Asia and Australia.

The most important member of the family in world trade is the Brazil nut (&quot;Bertholletia excelsa&quot;), valued for its edible nuts; the paradise nut (&quot;Lecythis&quot; species) is also eaten.

# &quot;Careya&quot; Roxb.
# &quot;Chydenanthus&quot; Miers
# &quot;Petersianthus&quot; Merr.
# &quot;Planchonia&quot; Blume
===Foetidioideae===
Previously Foetidiaceae from Madagascar is monogeneric:
* &quot;Foetidia&quot; Comm. ex Lam.

===Lecythidoideae===
Genera restricted to the New World tropics.
# &quot;Allantoma&quot; Miers
# &quot;Bertholletia&quot; Bonpl.

# &quot;Lecythis&quot; Loefl.
===Scytopetaloideae===
The APG II system of 2003 included genera from the family Scytopetalaceae and others
# &quot;Asteranthos&quot; Desf., also as Asteranthaceae
# &quot;Brazzeia&quot; Verc.
# &quot;Oubanguia&quot; Baill.
# &quot;Pierrina&quot; Engl.

<doc id="1138512" wikidata="Q7250838" url="?curid=1138512" title="Prospective short-circuit current">
<text>The prospective short-circuit current (PSCC), available fault current, or short-circuit making current is the highest electric current which can exist in a particular electrical system under short-circuit conditions. It is determined by the voltage and impedance of the supply system. It is of the order of a few thousand amperes for a standard domestic mains electrical installation, but may be as low as a few milliamperes in a separated extra-low voltage (SELV) system or as high as hundreds of thousands of amps in large industrial power systems. The term is used in electrical engineering rather than electronics.

Protective devices such as circuit breakers and fuses must be selected with an interrupting rating that exceeds the prospective short-circuit current, if they are to safely protect the circuit from a fault. When a large electric current is interrupted an arc forms, and if the breaking capacity of a fuse or circuit breaker is exceeded, it will not extinguish the arc. Current will continue, resulting in damage to equipment, fire, or explosion.

==Residential==
In designing domestic power installations, the short-circuit current available on the electrical outlets should not be too high or too low. The effect of too high short-circuit current is discussed in the previous section. The short-circuit current should be around 20 times the rating of the circuit to ensure the branch circuit protection clears a fault quickly. Quick disconnecting is needed, because during a line-to-ground short circuit the grounding pin potential on the power outlet can rise relative to the local earth (concrete floor, water pipe etc.) to a dangerous voltage, which needs to be shut down quickly for safety. If the short-circuit current is lower than this figure, special precautions need to be taken to make sure that the system is safe; those usually include using a residual-current device (a.k.a. ground fault interrupter) for extra protection.

The short-circuit current available on the electrical outlets is often tested when inspecting new electrical installations to make sure that the short-circuit current is within reasonable limits. A high short-circuit current on the outlet also shows that the resistance from the electrical panel to the outlet is low, so there won&#x27;t be an unacceptably high voltage drop on the wires under normal load.

The resistance path is the total resistance back through the supply transformer; to measure this an engineer will use an &quot;earth fault loop impedance meter&quot;. The application of a low voltage allows a small current to pass from the socket back through earth to the supply transformer and distribution board. The resistance measured can be used to calculate the short-circuit current.

==Utility and industrial==
In power transmission systems and industrial power systems, often the short-circuit current is calculated from the nameplate impedances of connected equipment and the impedance of interconnecting wiring. For simple radial distribution systems with only a few elements, hand calculation is feasible, but computer software is generally used for more complex systems. Where rotating machines (generators and motors) are present in the system, the time-varying effect of their contribution to a short circuit may be evaluated. Stored energy in a generator may contribute much more current to a short circuit in the first few cycles than later on; this affects the interrupting rating selected for circuit breakers and fuses. An isolated generator may be specially designed to ensure that it can source enough current on a short circuit to allow subordinate overcurrent protection devices to operate properly.

Where an industrial system is fed from an electrical utility, the short circuit level at the point of connection may be specified, often with minimum and maximum values or values to be expected after system growth. This allows calculation by an industrial customer of its internal fault levels within its plant. If the prospective short-circuit current from the utility source is very large compared to the customer&#x27;s system size, an &quot;infinite bus&quot; is assumed, with zero effective internal impedance; the only limit to the prospective short-circuit current is then the impedances after the defined &quot;infinite bus&quot;.

In polyphase electrical systems, generally phase-to-phase, phase-to-ground (earth), and phase-to-neutral faults are examined, as well as a case where all three phases are short-circuited. Because impedances of cables or devices varies between phases, the prospective short-circuit current varies depending on the type of fault. Protection devices in the system must respond to all three cases. The method of symmetrical components is used to simplify analysis of unsymmetrical faults in three-phase systems.

<doc id="1138526" wikidata="Q631931" url="?curid=1138526" title="Decorative arts">
<text>The decorative arts are arts or crafts whose aim is the design and manufacture of objects that are both beautiful and functional. This includes most of the objects for the interiors of buildings, as well as interior design, but typically excludes architecture. Ceramic art, metalwork, furniture, jewellery, fashion, various forms of the textile arts and glassware are major groupings.

Applied arts largely overlap with the decorative arts, and in modern parlance they are both often placed under the umbrella category of design. The decorative arts are often categorized in distinction to the &quot;fine arts&quot;, namely painting, drawing, photography, and large-scale sculpture, which generally produce objects solely for their aesthetic quality and capacity to stimulate the intellect.

==Distinction from the fine arts==

The distinction between the decorative and fine arts essentially arose from the post-renaissance art of the West, where the distinction is for the most part meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most valued works, or even all works, include those in decorative media. For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, often using geometric and plant forms, as does the art of many traditional cultures.

The distinction between decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating Chinese art, and neither is it for understanding early Medieval art in Europe. During that period in Europe, fine arts such as manuscript illumination and monumental sculpture existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in goldsmith work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as ivory carving. Large-scale wall-paintings were much less regarded, crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources. They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for mosaic, which for the period must be considered a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be considered decorative. A similar fate has befallen tapestry, which late medieval and Renaissance royalty regarded as the most magnificent artform, and was certainly the most expensive. The term &quot;ars sacra&quot; (&quot;sacred arts&quot;) is sometimes used for medieval christian art executed in metal, ivory, textiles, and other more valuable materials but not for rare secular works from that period.
The view of decoration as a &#x27;lesser art&#x27; was formally challenged in the 1970s by writers and art historians like Amy Goldin and Anne Swartz. The argument for a singular narrative in art had lost traction by the close of the 20th century through post-modernist irony and increasing curatorial interest in street art and in ethnic decorative traditions. The Pattern and Decoration movement in New York galleries in the 1980s, though short-lived, opened the way to a more inclusive evaluation of the value of art objects.

==Influence of different materials==
Modern understanding of the art of many cultures tends to be distorted by the modern privileging of fine visual arts media over others, as well as the very different survival rates of works in different media. Works in metal, above all in precious metals, are liable to be &quot;recycled&quot; as soon as they fall from fashion, and were often used by owners as repositories of wealth, to be melted down when extra money was needed. Illuminated manuscripts have a much higher survival rate, especially in the hands of the church, as there was little value in the materials and they were easy to store.

==Renaissance attitudes==
The promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as Vasari promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the High Renaissance, that placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as Michelangelo, Raphael or Leonardo da Vinci, reviving to some extent the approach of antiquity. Most European art during the Middle Ages had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques had been highly valued. In China both approaches had co-existed for many centuries: ink wash painting, mostly of landscapes, was to a large extent produced by and for the scholar-bureaucrats or &quot;literati&quot;, and was intended as an expression of the artist&#x27;s imagination above all, while other major fields of art, including the very important Chinese ceramics produced in effectively industrial conditions, were produced according to a completely different set of artistic values.

==Arts and Crafts movement==
The lower status given to works of decorative art in contrast to fine art narrowed with the rise of the Arts and Crafts movement. This aesthetic movement of the second half of the 19th century was born in England and inspired by the writings of Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin and William Morris. The movement represented the beginning of a greater appreciation of the decorative arts throughout Europe. The appeal of the Arts and Crafts movement to a new generation led the English architect and designer Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo to organize the Century Guild for craftsmen in 1882, championing the idea that there was no meaningful difference between the fine and decorative arts. Many converts, both from professional artists&#x27; ranks and from among the intellectual class as a whole, helped spread the ideas of the movement.

The influence of the Arts and Crafts movement led to the decorative arts being given a greater appreciation and status in society and this was soon reflected by changes in the law. Until the enactment of the Copyright Act 1911 only works of fine art had been protected from unauthorized copying. The 1911 Act extended the definition of an &quot;artistic work&quot; to include works of &quot;artistic craftsmanship&quot;.

== Mass production and customization ==

In the context of mass production and consumerism some individuals will attempt to create or maintain their lifestyle or to construct their identity when forced to accept mass-produced identical objects in their life. According to Colin Campbell in his piece “The Craft Consumer”, this is done by selecting goods with specific intentions in mind to alter them. Instead of accepting a foreign object for what it is, the foreign object is incorporated and changed to fit one&#x27;s lifestyle and choices, or customized.

One way to achieve a customized look and feel to common objects is to change their external appearance by applying decorative techniques, as in decoupage, art cars, truck art in South Asia and IKEA hacking.

<text>Sir Gustav Victor Joseph Nossal (born 4 June 1931) is an Austrian-born Australian research biologist. He is famous for his contributions to the fields of antibody formation and immunological tolerance.

==Early life and education==
Nossal&#x27;s family was from Vienna, Austria. He was born four weeks prematurely in Bad Ischl while his mother was on holiday. His family left their home town of Vienna for Australia in 1939 following Nazi Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria. As his father&#x27;s grandparents were Jewish, he was also considered Jewish and at risk of being sent to concentration camps. In an interview with Adam Spencer, Nossal noted that his father was not a professing Jew but of Jewish ethnicity as he had been baptised a Roman Catholic as a child. Nossal remarked that his father &quot;therefore thought that he would be somewhat protected from the Holocaust-type predicament. Of course, he hadn&#x27;t properly read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. It was all spelt out there: if your four grandparents were Jewish, then you were Jewish.&quot; He was baptised and remains a practising Roman Catholic.

Nossal showed interest in medicine and wanted to become a doctor since the age of seven. When he first attended school in Australia, Nossal spoke no English
but he graduated from St Aloysius&#x27; College in 1947
as the dux of the college. In 1948, he entered the Sydney Medical School, graduating later with first-class honours from the University of Sydney. At the age of 26, he left his job in Sydney and moved to Melbourne to work with Macfarlane Burnet in medical science at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and gained his PhD degree at the University of Melbourne in 1960.

==Religious beliefs==
On describing his views on religion Nossal said:
==Career==
Following the retirement of Macfarlane Burnet in 1965, at the age of 35 Nossal became director of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, a position that he kept until 1996. In parallel, he was Professor of Medical Biology at the University of Melbourne. Nossal&#x27;s research was in fundamental immunology, in the field of &quot;antibody formation and immunological tolerance&quot;. He has written five books and 530 scientific articles in this and related fields.

Nossal has been President (1970-1973) of the 30,000-member world body of immunology, the International Union of Immunological Societies; President of the Australian Academy of Science (1994-1998); a member of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) (1989 to 1998); and Chairman of the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (1987-1996). He has been chairman of the committee overseeing the World Health Organization&#x27;s Vaccines and Biologicals Program (1993-2002) and Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Council of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Children&#x27;s Vaccine Program (1998-2003). He was Deputy Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation from 1998 to 2000. He was Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Global Foundation, The purpose of the foundation was to &quot;encourage Australia’s sustainable national development in a global context.&quot; Sir Gustav is a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria and of the advisory board of the Health Impact Fund.

==Personal life==
Nossal is married to Lyn whom he met and later married on completion of his medical course at the University of Sydney. Together, they have four children and nine grandchildren.

<doc id="1138537" wikidata="Q2801788" url="?curid=1138537" title="Dulcinians">
<text>The Dulcinians were a religious sect of the Late Middle Ages, originating within the Apostolic Brethren. The Dulcinians, or Dulcinites, and Apostolic Brethren were inspired by Franciscan ideals and influenced by the Joachimites but were considered heretical by the Catholic Church. Their name derives from the movement&#x27;s leader, Fra Dolcino of Novara (c. 1250–1307), who was burned as a heretic on the orders of Pope Clement V.

==History==
The Dulcinian sect began in 1300 when Gherardo Segarelli, founder of the Apostolic Brethren, was burned at the stake in Parma during a brutal repression of the Apostolics. His followers went into hiding to save their lives. Fra Dolcino had joined the Apostolics between 1288 and 1292 and became their leader. He published the first of his letters explaining his ideas about the epochs of history based on the theories of Gioacchino da Fiore.

At the beginning of 1303, Dolcino reunited the Apostolic movement near Lake Garda. He met Margaret of Trent (his lover or &quot;sister in spirit&quot;) and wrote the second letter to the Apostolics. At the beginning of 1304, three Dulcinians were burned by the Inquisition, leading Dolcino to evacuate the community to the west side of the Sesia valley, near his native Novara. At the end of 1304, only 1,400 survived on the top of Mount Parete Calva, in the fortified &quot;Piano dei Gazzari&quot;. They descended the mountain to pillage and kill the people in the valley, responsible in their eyes for not defending the group against the episcopal troops. The villagers called them &quot;&quot;Gazzari&quot; (Cathars), and joined the soldiers in opposition.

Dolcino justified the acts committed by the Dulcinians by affirming their perfection and holiness based on Saint Paul&#x27;s Epistle to Titus (1:15): &quot;To the pure all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are corrupted.&quot;

Margaret and Dolcino were captured and executed.

==Theories==
The main concepts of the Dulcinians were:
* The fall of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and return of the Church to its original ideals of humility and poverty;
* The fall of the feudal system;
* Human liberation from any restraint, and from entrenched power;
* Creation of a new egalitarian society based on mutual aid and respect, holding property in common and respecting gender equality.

Fra Dolcino was inspired by the millenarist theories of Gioacchino da Fiore. He viewed the history of humanity as 4 &quot;epochs&quot;:
*The period of the Old Testament;
*The period of Jesus Christ and the Apostles, characterized by chastity and poverty;
*The period of Emperor Constantine I and Pope Sylvester I, characterized by the decline of the church due to ambition and excessive wealth;
*The period of the Apostolics, led by Segarelli and Dolcino, characterized by poverty, chastity and the absence of government.

In his first letter, Dolcino gave his interpretation of the seven angels and seven churches of the Apocalypse of John: 
*The angel of Ephesus was Saint Benedict, and his church was the monastic order;
*The angel of Pergamom was Pope Sylvester I, and his church was the clerical order;
*The angel of Sardis was Saint Francis, and his church was the Friars Minor;
*The angel of Laodicea was Saint Dominic, and his church was the Friars Preacher;
*The angel of Smyrna was Gerard of Parma, and his church was the Apostolic Brethren;
*The angel of Thyatira was Fra Dolcino, and his church was the Dulcinian movement;
*The angel of Philadelphia would be the &quot;new holy pope&quot;, and the last three churches would constitute &quot;the new church of these new days&quot;&quot;.

Following the death of Boniface VIII, Dolcino produced a schedule of 4 popes:
*Celestine V
*Boniface VIII: ruin would fall on him and the &quot;king of the south&quot;
*Boniface&#x27;s successor: ruin would fall on him and all the cardinals
*The new holy pope

Thus, the advent of the &quot;new holy pope&quot; was postponed to the second pope after the death of Boniface VIII. Dolcino never proposed himself as the new pope in his letters, although this was one of the accusations by the Inquisition. The rallying cry &quot;poenitentiam agite&quot; (do penance) was attributed to them in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, a novel by Umberto Eco.

<doc id="1138539" wikidata="Q468289" url="?curid=1138539" title="Trans-splicing">
<text>&quot;Trans&quot;-splicing is a special form of RNA processing where exons from two different primary RNA transcripts are joined end to end and ligated. It is usually found in eukaryotes and mediated by the spliceosome, although some bacteria and archaea also have &quot;half-genes&quot; for tRNAs.

== Genic &quot;trans&quot;-splicing ==
Whereas &quot;normal&quot; (&quot;cis&quot;-)splicing processes a single molecule, &quot;trans&quot;-splicing generates a single RNA transcript from multiple separate pre-mRNAs. This phenomenon can be exploited for molecular therapy to address mutated gene products. Genic trans-splicing allows variability in RNA diversity and increases proteome complexity.

=== Oncogenesis ===
While some fusion transcripts occur via &quot;trans&quot;-splicing in normal human cells, &quot;trans&quot;-splicing can also be the mechanism behind certain oncogenic fusion transcripts.

== SL &quot;trans&quot;-splicing ==
Spliced leader (SL) &quot;trans&quot;-splicing is used by certain microorganisms, notably protists of the Kinetoplastea class to express genes. In these organisms, a capped splice leader RNA is transcribed, and simultaneously, genes are transcribed in long polycistrons. The capped splice leader is &quot;trans&quot;-spliced onto each gene to generate monocistronic capped and polyadenylated transcripts. These early-diverging eukaryotes use few introns, and the spliceosome they possess show some unusual variations in their structure assembly. They also possess multiple eIF4E isoforms with specialized roles in capping. The spliced leader sequence is highly conserved in lower species that undergo trans-splicing. Such as trypanosomes. While the spliced leader&#x27;s role is not known in the cell, it&#x27;s thought to be involved in translation initiation. In C&quot;.elegans&quot;, the splicing of the sequence leader occurs close to the initiation codon. Some scientists also suggest the sequence is required for cell viability. In Ascaris, the spliced leader sequence is needed to the RNA gene can be transcribed. The Spliced leader sequence may be responsible for initiation, mRNA localization, and translation initiation or inhibition.

Some other eukaryotes, notably among dinoflagellates, sponges, nematodes, cnidarians, ctenophores, flatworms, crustaceans, chaetognaths, rotifers, and tunicates also use more or less frequently the SL &quot;trans&quot;-splicing. In the tunicate &quot;Ciona intestinalis&quot;, the extent of SL &quot;trans&quot;-splicing is better described by a quantitative view recognising frequently and infrequently &quot;trans&quot;-spliced genes rather than a binary and conventional categorisation of &quot;trans&quot;-spliced versus non-&quot;trans&quot;-spliced genes.

The SL &quot;trans&quot;-splicing functions in the resolution of polycistronic transcripts of operons into individual 5&#x27;-capped mRNAs. This processing is achieved when the outrons are &quot;trans&quot;-spliced to unpaired, downstream acceptor sites adjacent to cistron open reading frames.

== Mechanism ==
Trans-splicing is characterized by the joining of two separate exons transcribed RNAs. The signal for this splicing is the outron at the 5’ end of the mRNA, in the absence of a functional 5’ splice site upstream. When the 5’ outron in spliced, the 5’ splice site of the spliced leader RNA is branched to the outron and forms an intermediate. This step results in a free spliced leader exon. The exon is then spliced to the first exon on the pre-mRNA and the intermediate is released. Trans-splicing differs from cis-splicing in that there is no 5&#x27; splice site on the pre-mRNA. Instead the 5&#x27; splice site is provided by the SL sequence.

== Trans-splicing between sense and anti-sense strands ==
As a result of the sense strand undergoing transcription, a pre-mRNA is formed that complements the sense strand. The anti-sense strand is also transcribed resulting in a complementary pre-mRNA strand. The exons from the two transcripts are spliced together to form a chimeric mRNA.

== Alternative Trans-splicing ==
Alternative trans-splicing includes intragenic trans-splicing and intergenic trans-splicing. Intragenic trans-splicing involves duplication of exons in the pre-mRNA. Intergenic trans-splicing is characterized by the splicing together of exons formed form the pre-mRNA of two different genes, resulting in trans-genic mRNA.

<doc id="1138543" wikidata="Q7648517" url="?curid=1138543" title="Susan Weber (historian)">
<text>Susan Weber (born 1954) is an American historian. She is the founder and director of the Bard Graduate Center (BGC) for studies in the decorative arts, design history, and material culture affiliated with Bard College in Dutchess County, New York. She was previously married to George Soros.

==Early life and education==
Susan Weber was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the daughter of Iris and Murray Weber. Her father was a manufacturer of shoe accessories; her mother was a housewife. Her father was born in New York City to parents who had emigrated from Russia. Her mother passed on her fondness for the decorative arts. She grew up in the New York City area in a non-observant Jewish household; summing up her upbringing, Weber stated: &quot;We were cultural Jews.&quot;

She attended an Episcopal high school in Brooklyn and graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University with a degree in art history. In 1990, she earned a master&#x27;s degree from Cooper-Hewitt/Parsons.

She also studied at the Royal College of Art in London, where she earned her PhD degree (1998) with a thesis on the furniture of E. W. Godwin.

==Career==
Weber was executive director of the Open Society Institute (OSI), the umbrella name for some 24 independent foundations that support the advancement of freedom of expression around the globe. OSI also supports cultural exchange through grants to individuals and associations.

In 1991, Weber was turned down for the job of director of graduate education at the Parsons School of Design. So, with $20 million of her husband&#x27;s money, she started her own school in 1993, establishing the Bard Graduate Center where she is professor of the history of the decorative arts. BGC offers graduate degrees in history of the decorative and applied arts, cultural and design history, garden history, and landscape studies.

==Personal life==
In 1983, Weber married billionaire George Soros, twenty-four years her senior, and the primary contributor to the Open Society Institute (OSI). They had two children, Alexander (born 1985) and Gregory (born 1988). They divorced in 2005.

<text>Sagesund is a small village in the municipality of Tvedestrand in Agder county, Norway. It is located on the shore of the Oksefjorden and along the Norwegian County Road 411. Sagesund is located about southeast of the town of Tvedestrand and about west of the villages of Dypvåg and Kråkvåg. There is also bus service from the town of Tvedestrand.

Approximately 50 people live there on a permanent basis. It is popular in the summer, when the population at least doubles. It has a sports arena with tennis courts, and a beach volleyball field. The fjord is also an excellent place for waterskiing and wakeboarding, but also for more quiet activities.

==History==
Sagesund got its name from a sash saw mill, located in a creek. The lumbermill was used by local farmers. In the 19th century there were three shipyards here, building sailing ships, brigs, barques, schooners, etc. There used to be a large ice storage building. It was used to hold ice that was to be exported. In the 1950s, there were three stores, a post office, a galvanic workshop, an assembly house, and an electric sawmill.

The sailboat &quot;Origo&quot; started and ended its circumnavigation of the world from Sagesund in 1994. &quot;Nor Siglar&quot;, with half the crew from Sagesund, also included Sagesund as a natural stop on its way around the globe.

<doc id="1138550" wikidata="Q7658517" url="?curid=1138550" title="Swing (politics)">
<text>An electoral swing analysis (or swing) shows the extent of change in voter support, typically from one election to another, expressed as a positive or negative percentage. A multi-party swing is an indicator of a change in the electorate&#x27;s preference between candidates or parties, often between major parties in a two-party system. A swing can be calculated for the electorate as a whole, for a given electoral district or for a particular demographic.

A swing is particularly useful for analysing change in voter support over time, or as a tool for predicting the outcome of elections in constituency-based systems. Swing is also usefully deployed when analysing the shift in voter intentions revealed by (political) opinion polls or to compare polls concisely which may rely on differing samples and on markedly different swings and therefore predict extraneous results.

==Calculation==
The swing is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote in a particular election to the percentage of the vote belonging to the same party or candidate at the previous election.

===One-party swing===
One-party swing (in percentage points) = Percentage of vote in current election − percentage of vote in previous election

For example, if a party had 41% of the vote in the previous election, and has 51% of the vote in the current election, the swing is 10 percentage points in their favour. This could be reported as +10 points.

===Two-party swing===
Two-party swing is calculated by taking the sum of the one-party swings of each party, then dividing by two.

In many nation states&#x27; media, including in Australia and the United Kingdom, swing is normally expressed in terms of two parties. This practice is most useful where most governments tend to be from an existing two-party system, and is sometimes used to try to predict the outcome of elections in constituency-based systems where different seats are held with different previous levels of support.

An assumption underlies extrapolated national calculations: that all districts will experience the same swing as shown in a poll or in a place&#x27;s results. The advantage of this swing is the fact that the loss of support for one party will in most cases be accompanied by smaller or bigger gain in support for the other, but both figures are averaged into one. Employing the two assumptions allows the analyst to compute an electoral pendulum, predicting how many (and which) seats will change hands given a particular swing, and what size uniform swing would therefore bring about a change of government.

==Australia==
In Australia, the term &quot;swing&quot; refers to the change in the performance of a political party or candidate in an election or opinion poll. As Australia uses the preferential voting system, swing can be expressed in terms of the primary vote (first preference vote), or in terms of the two-party-preferred or two-candidate-preferred result, which may represent significantly different values due to preference flows; i.e. a 5% primary vote swing does not necessarily represent an equivalent swing in TPP or TCP terms.

==United Kingdom==
In the UK, a two-party swing (averaged model) is generally used, which adds one party&#x27;s increase in share of the vote (expressed as a percentage point) to the percentage-point fall of another party, and divides the total by two.

Thus, if Party One&#x27;s vote rises by 4 points and Party Two&#x27;s vote falls 5 points, the swing is 4.5 points (Party 2 to Party 1). For disambiguation, suffixes such as: (Con to Lab) (Lab to Lib Dem) (Lib Dem to Con) must be added where three parties stand. Otherwise, a problem when deciding which swing is meant and which swing is best to publish arises where a lower party takes first or second, or where a party loses one of the top two places.

Originating as a mathematical calculation for comparing the results of two constituencies, any of these figures can be used as an indication of the scale of voter change between any two political parties, as shown below for the 2010 United Kingdom general election:

==United States==
Swing in the United States can refer to swing states, those states that are known to shift an outcome between Democrats and Republican parties, equivalent on a local level to marginal seats. By contrast, a non-swing state is the direct equivalent of a safe seat as it rarely changes in outcome. The extent of change in political outcome is heavily influenced by the voting system in use.

==Three party swing or greater==
Some websites provide a pie chart based or column-based multi party swingometer where ± x%, ± x%, ± x% and so on is displayed or can be input for three parties (or more in more plural democracies). This tool or illustration provides likely outcomes wherever more than two political parties have a significant influence on which politicians are elected. In multiparty systems exit polls frequently include a question as to voting behavior in the last applicable election. Based on those exit polls &quot;voter migration&quot; (where vote gains for a specific party came from and losses of another went to) analyses are published and discussed in election coverage.

<doc id="1138554" wikidata="Q7392918" url="?curid=1138554" title="SR protein">
<text>SR proteins are a conserved family of proteins involved in RNA splicing. SR proteins are named because they contain a protein domain with long repeats of serine and arginine amino acid residues, whose standard abbreviations are &quot;S&quot; and &quot;R&quot; respectively. SR proteins are ~200-600 amino acids in length and composed of two domains, the RNA recognition motif (RRM) region and the RS domain. SR proteins are more commonly found in the nucleus than the cytoplasm, but several SR proteins are known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

SR proteins were discovered in the 1990s in Northern Ireland, Belfast in amphibian oocytes, and later in humans. In general, metazoans appear to have SR proteins and unicellular organisms lack SR proteins.

SR proteins are important in constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, genome stabilization, nonsense-mediated decay, and translation. SR proteins alternatively splice pre-mRNA by preferentially selecting different splice sites on the pre-mRNA strands to create multiple mRNA transcripts from one pre-mRNA transcript. Once splicing is complete the SR protein may or may not remain attached to help shuttle the mRNA strand out of the nucleus. As RNA Polymerase II is transcribing DNA into RNA, SR proteins attach to newly made pre-mRNA to prevent the pre-mRNA from binding to the coding DNA strand to increase genome stabilization. Topoisomerase I and SR proteins also interact to increase genome stabilization. SR proteins can control the concentrations of specific mRNA that is successfully translated into protein by selecting for poison exons during alternative splicing. SR proteins can alternatively splice poison exons into their own mRNA transcripts to auto-regulate the concentration of SR proteins. Through the mTOR pathway and interactions with polyribosomes, SR proteins can increase translation of mRNA.

Ataxia telangiectasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, several cancers, HIV-1, and spinal muscular atrophy have all been linked to alternative splicing by SR proteins.

==History==
SR proteins were discovered independently through the use of two different monoclonal antibodies. The first antibody, mAb104 found SR proteins in the nucleus of amphibian oocytes. The mAb104 antibody binds to a phosphoepitope on the C-terminal domain of SR proteins. mAb104 also binds to active sites of RNA polymerase II transcription. This antibody allowed identification of four SR proteins (SRp20, SRp40, SRp55 and SRp75) and demonstrated their conservation among vertebrates and invertebrates. The second antibody, B52 was used in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. B52 is closely related to the splicing factor SF2/ASF and bound to both RNA and DNA in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. The discovery of SR proteins in &quot;Drosophila&quot; revealed three SR proteins, SWAP (suppressor-of-white-apricot), Tra and Tra-2 (transformer and transformer-2 respectively).

==Examples of genes==
The following is a list of 14 human genes encoding SR proteins involved in splicing:


==Structure==
SR proteins are characterized by an RS domain and at least one RNA recognition motif (RRM). The RRM is typically located near the N-terminus. The RS domain is located near the C-terminal end of an SR protein. RS domains regulate protein-protein interactions of SR proteins. Based on sequence analysis, SR proteins are suspected to be intrinsically disordered proteins resulting in an unstructured RS domain. Eight unphosphorylated repeats of arginine and serine in the RS domain take a helical form with arginine on the outside to reduce charge and in a phosphorylated state, the eight repeats of arginine and serine form a &#x27;claw&#x27; shape.

SR proteins can have more than one RRM domain. The second RRM domain is called the RNA recognition motif homolog (RRMH). RRM domains are located near the N-terminus end of SR proteins. The RRM domain mediates the RNA interactions of the SR proteins by binding to exon splicing enhancer sequences. The RRMH usually has weaker interactions with RNA compared to the RRM domain. From NMR, the RRM domain of SRSF1, an SR protein, has a RNA binding fold structure. The RRM domain may also protect the phosphorylated RS domain, which suggests that the RS domain fits into the RRM domain.

==Location and translocation==
SR proteins can be found in both the cytosol and in nuclear speckles in the nucleus. SR proteins are mostly found in the nucleus. Localization depends on the phosphorylation of the RS domain of the SR protein. Phosphorylation of the RS domain causes the SR proteins to enter and remain in the nucleus. Partial dephosphorylation of the RS domain causes the SR proteins to leave the nucleus and SR proteins with unphosphorylated RS domains are found in the cytosol.

SR proteins are located in two different types of nuclear speckles, interchromatin granule clusters and perichromatin fibrils. Interchromatin granule clusters are for the storage and reassembly of pre-mRNA splicing proteins. Perichromatin fibrils are areas of gene transcription and where SR proteins associate with RNA polymerase II for co-transcriptional splicing.

Two protein kinases are thought to play a role in the localization of SR proteins in the nucleus. SR protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) binds to and phosphorylates 10-12 serine residues on the N-terminal portion of the RS domain of SR proteins located in the cytosol. SR proteins can translocate into the nucleus after the serines are phosphorylated. The phosphorylated SR protein moves into the nucleus and relocates to a nuclear speckle. The second protein kinase, CLK1, then phosphorylates the remaining serines on the RS domain of the SR protein causing it to translocate out of the nuclear speckle and become associated with RNA polymerase II for co-transcriptional splicing of RNA.

Movement of SR proteins out of the nucleus is controlled by a different mechanism. SR proteins that do not leave the nucleus are called nonshuttling SR proteins and those that do leave the nucleus are called shuttling SR proteins. SRp20 (SFRS3) and 9G8 (SFRS7) are two examples of mammalian shuttling SR proteins. Both recognize and bind poly-A RNA to transport RNA. Most SR proteins that do not shuttle out of the nucleus with an RNA transcript have nuclear retention signals. Shuttling SR proteins associate with the nuclear export factor TAP for export out of the nucleus. Methylation of arginine residues in the RRM may also contribute to the export of SR proteins out of the nucleus.

== Function ==
SR proteins have been shown to have roles in alternative and constitutive splicing resulting in differential gene expression and also play a part in mRNA export, genome stabilization, non-sense mediated decay, and translation.

===Splicing===
The first step for SR proteins to begin alternative splicing of an RNA transcript is for SR proteins to bind on to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. The CTD is made of the conserved repeating heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS. Different steps of transcription have different levels of phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Before initiation of transcription, the CTD has low levels of phosphorylation, but it is subsequently hyperphosphorylated during initiation and elongation. The RS domain of SR proteins interacts with the hyperphosphorylated CTD during elongation of transcription.

RNA polymerase II moves from initiation to elongation once P-TEFb kinase phosphorylates Ser5 and Ser2 on RNA polymerase II. SR proteins interact with CDK9, the kinase component of P-TEFb leading to the phosphorylation of Ser2. SR proteins bind to the phosphorylated Ser2 on the CTD. The positioning of SR proteins on the RNA polymerase II allows the SR proteins to &quot;see&quot; the new RNA transcript first. SR proteins then moves from the RNA polymerase II to the pre-mRNA transcript.

Once on the new RNA transcript, SR proteins can then stimulate the formation of the spliceosome. SR proteins promote the binding of U1 snRNP and U2AF snRNP to the new RNA transcript to begin the formation of the spliceosome. SR proteins also help U2 recognize and bind to the branch site of the intron that is to be excised. Later in spliceosome formation, SR proteins help recruit U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs.

SR proteins are important for selecting splice sites for alternative splicing. SR proteins recognize intron and exon enhancers and silencers. SR proteins combine with SR-like proteins to select exon splicing enhancers on RNA transcripts causing U2 snRNP to bind to the upstream, adjacent branch site causing spliceosome assembly at the specific 3&#x27; site selected by the SR proteins.
SR proteins&#x27; alternative splicing promoting activities are in contrast to those of hnRNPs. hnRNPs bind to exon splicing silencers, ESS, and inhibit the inclusion of exons, thus hnRNPs are splicing repressors. SR proteins and hnRNPs compete for binding to ESEs and ESSs sequences in exons. Binding is based on concentrations of SR proteins and hnRNPs in cells. If the cell has a high concentration of SR proteins then SR proteins are more likely to bind to ESEs compared to hnRNPs binding to ESS. If the cell has a high concentration of hnRNPs then hnRNPs can outcompete SR proteins for ESSs compared to ESEs.

SR proteins may work in an antagonistic fashion, competing with each other to bind to exonic splicing enhancers. Some evidence suggests that selection of the mRNA splicing variant depends upon the relative ratios of SR proteins. SR proteins appear to be redundant. Experiments have shown that knocking down SR proteins with RNAi shows no detectable phenotype in &quot;C. elegans&quot;. After knocking down one specific SR protein another different SR protein can make up for the lost function of the SR protein that was knocked down. Specific SR proteins&#x27; activities are important for specific tissues and developmental stages.

====Exon dependent roles====
SR proteins select alternative upstream 3&#x27; splice sites by recruiting U2AF35 and U2AF65 to specific ESE pyrimidine sequences in the exon of the pre-mRNA transcript.

SR proteins can also alternatively select different downstream 5&#x27; splice sites by binding to ESE upstream of the splice site. The suspected mechanism is that alternative 5&#x27; splice sites are chosen when SR proteins bind to upstream ESE and interacts with U1-70K and together recruit U1 to the 5&#x27; splice site.

In constitutive splicing SR proteins bind to U2AF and U1-70K to bridge the gap between the two components of the spliceosome to mark the 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; splice sites. Constitutively spliced exons have many different SR protein binding sequences that act as constitutive splicing enhancers. The difference between alternative and constitutive splicing is that during alternative splicing the splice site choice is regulated.

====Exon independent roles====
Exon independent roles of SR proteins are called exon independent because it is not known if SR proteins must bind to exons in order for them to perform exon independent activities. SR proteins can bind to U1 and U2AF while they are bound to the 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; splice sites at the same time without binding to the pre-mRNA transcript. The SR protein thus creates a bridge across the intron in what is called a cross-intron interaction. SR proteins also recruit the tri-snRNP molecule U4/U6·U5 to the maturing spliceosome complex by interacting with RS domains in the tri-snRNP. SR proteins might be able to bind directly to the 5&#x27; splice site and recruit the U1 complex of the spliceosome.

===mRNA export===
SR proteins can be either shuttling SR proteins or nonshuttling SR proteins. Some SR proteins associate with RNA export factor TAP, a nuclear export factor, to shuttle RNA out of the nucleus. The shuttling property of the SR protein is determined by the phosphorylation status of the RS domain. When hyperphosphorylated, SR proteins bind to pre-mRNA transcripts, but SR proteins become partially dephosphorylated during transcription allowing them to interact with NXF1. Thus the phosphorylation of the RS domain determines if the SR proteins stays with the RNA transcript after co-transcription splicing and while the mRNP matures. If the RS domain remains phosphorylated, then the SR protein will not shuttle from the nucleus to the cytosol. The phosphorylated SR protein will be sorted away from the mRNA transcript further preventing shuttling of the phosphorylated SR proteins. If the RS domain becomes partially dephosphorylated then the SR protein will shuttle out of the nucleus into the cytosol. The methylation and charge of arginine residues in the RRM domain also contributes to the export of SR proteins associated with mRNA.

===Genomic stabilization===
SR proteins can increase genome stability by preventing the formation of R loops in the DNA strand that is actively being transcribed during transcription. SR protein SC35 has the ability to bind to the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II at the phosphorylated C-terminal domain. Once RNA polymerase II begins making the new RNA strand, SR proteins move from the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II to the new RNA strand. The movement of SR proteins from the RNA polymerase II to the new RNA strand prevents the new RNA strand, which is complementary to the template DNA strand, from binding to the template DNA strand thus preventing R loops.

SR proteins can also stabilize DNA during transcription through an interaction with Topoisomerase I. When Topoisomerase I, Topo I, reduces supercoiling caused by transcription when it is bound to DNA. When Topo I is not bound to DNA it can phosphorylate the SR protein SF2/ASF. Topo I and SF2/ASF interact when SF2/ASF is hypophosphorylated during transcription elongation. SR proteins can become hypophosphorylated during elongation decreasing their affinity for RNA polymerase II causing SR proteins to move to Topo I. When Topo I complexes with SF2/ASF, it can no longer undo the supercoiling of DNA causing elongation to pause. Topo I phosphorylates S2F/ASF increasing the SR proteins affinity for RNA poly II moving S2F/ASF from the Topo I back to RNA poly II allowing elongation to continue.

===Nonsense-mediated decay===
SR proteins can alternatively splice pre-mRNA transcripts to include nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) codons in the mRNA. The most common method of an NMD response in cells is alternative splicing. If a pre-mRNA transcript has a duplicated 5&#x27; splice site and SR proteins are over expressed then NMD can be upregulated. The splice variant with the NMD codon is chosen more often during splicing and the cell is more sensitive to NMD further down stream during translation. It is estimated that close to 30% of alternatively spliced mRNA are degraded by NMD. SR protein concentrations in cells can be auto-regulated by NMD codons in SR proteins pre-mRNA. For example, SC35 SR protein can alternatively splice a SC35 pre-mRNA to include a NMD codon in the mRNA. The location of SR protein binding on a pre-mRNA strand and which SR proteins are binding determine the NMD activity of a cell.

===Translation===
SR proteins can indirectly and directly influence translation. SR proteins SF2/ASF alternatively splices the transcript of MNK2. MNK2 is a kinase that initiates translation. High levels of SF2/ASF produce an isoform of MNK2 that increases cap-dependent translation by promoting phosphorylation of MAPK-independent eIF4E. SF2/ASF recruits components of the mTOR pathway, specifically S6K1. SF2/ASF creates an oncogenic form of S6K1 to increase the prevalence of cap-dependent translation. SF2/ASF can also interact with polyribosomes to directly influence translation of mRNA into protein by recruiting component of the mTOR pathway. SF2/ASF increases the phosphorylation of rpS6 and eIF4B by S6K1. 9G8 increases the translation of unspliced mRNA with a constitutive transport sequence.

==Diseases==
Genetic diversity is increased by the alternative splicing activities of SR proteins, but splicing can also result in mutations in mRNA strands. Mutations in pre-mRNA can affect the correct splice site selection for SR proteins. Mutations in mRNA, because of nonsense-associated altered splicing by SR proteins, have been linked to ataxia telangiectasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, several cancers, HIV-1, and spinal muscular atrophy.

===Cancer===
Several SR proteins have been implicated in cancer. Elevated levels of SF2/ASF, SC35, and SRp20 have all been associated with breast and ovarian cancer development. SF2/ASF is also upregulated in lung, kidney, and liver tumors. SFRS1, the gene that codes for SF2/ASF, is a known proto-oncogene. Mutations in the ESE sequence of BRCA1 have been linked to irregular exon skipping because SF2/ASF cannot recognize the ESE.

===HIV===
Three SR proteins have been implicated in HIV-1, SRp75, SF2/ASF, and SRp40. All three SR proteins are important for alternatively splicing the viral pre-mRNA. HIV can also change the concentrations of specific SR proteins in the cell. New drug treatments for HIV infections are looking to target specific SR proteins to prevent the virus from replicating in cells. One treatment works by blocking SR proteins from selecting 3&#x27; splice sites for an important HIV-1 regulatory protein.

===Spinal muscular atrophy===
Spina muscular atrophy is caused by a transition from cytosine to thymine. The transition mutation results in exon 7 being skipped during splicing. The exon could be skipped for two reasons. The first is that the mutation prevents SF2/ASF from recognizing the correct ESE. The second is that the mutation creates an ESS for an hnRNP to bind and block splicing of the exon.

<text>Asüna was a captive import automobile marque created in 1992 for sale in Canada by General Motors as a counterpart to Geo. It was one of two successors to the Passport marque, which had a similar intent.

== Overview ==
Preceding the Asüna marque, Passport sold a Korean (Daewoo) made rebadged Opel Kadett E known as the Passport Optima (which hit Canadian shores in 1988) as well as a selection of Isuzu cars and SUVs. General Motors Canada changed its branding strategy in 1988, disbanding Passport (the Optima was rebadged for 1992 as Pontiac LeMans). Isuzu was grouped together with Saab and GM&#x27;s new, import-fighting Saturn division to form Saturn-Saab-Isuzu dealerships. The Geo marque was introduced in Canada in (model year) 1992, offered at Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Cadillac dealerships, which had been selling the Geo-rebadged Suzuki marque&#x27;s products as Chevrolets from 1987 until the marque&#x27;s introduction. Sales of Geo vehicles were relatively successful, prompting Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealers to request GM Canada to provide a lineup of similar &quot;import&quot; vehicles. Asüna was created to fulfill this demand.

The Pontiac LeMans model name was dropped altogether in favour of trimline designations, selling as Asüna SE in base trim hatchbacks and sedans, and as Asüna GT as a higher trim hatchback for 1993. The Asüna lineup was rounded out by the 1993 Sunfire (Isuzu Impulse and Geo Storm twin) and 92-93 &quot;Sunrunner&quot; taking the GMC Tracker&#x27;s place in the Pontiac-Buick-GMC lineup.

Asüna sales could not match Geo&#x27;s, and the Asüna marque was eliminated for 1994. The SE/GT and Sunfire were dropped from the GM Canada lineup and the Sunrunner was rebadged as a Pontiac model.

<doc id="1138559" wikidata="Q1351281" url="?curid=1138559" title="Roger Eno">
<text>Roger Paul Eugene Eno (born 29 April 1959) is an English ambient music composer. He is the younger brother of Brian Eno.

==Early life and education==
Roger Paul Eugene Eno began euphonium lessons when he was 12 years old, and entered Colchester Institute to study music when he was 16. Upon graduating, and after a period of busking in London (where he briefly shared a house with artists Mark Wallinger and Andy Dog), Eno returned to Colchester to run a music therapy course at a local hospital for people with learning difficulties.

==Career==
In 1983, he had his first recording experience when he recorded the album &quot;Apollo&quot; with his brother Brian Eno and Canadian producer and musician Daniel Lanois at Lanois&#x27; Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario. His first solo album, &quot;Voices&quot;, was released in 1985.

Although mainly regarded as a pianist, Eno is a multi-instrumentalist and singer, as demonstrated on his later solo albums and collaborations. He has worked with several key artists apart from his brother including Bill Nelson, No-Man, Lol Hammond, Mads Arp, Peter Hammill, Gaudi, Tim Bowness and Michael Brook, the most successful of which was probably his co-written album &quot;The Familiar&quot;, with Kate St John.

Eno performs live on occasions and writes soundtracks. Much of his music has been used in films, including &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, &quot;Nine and a Half Weeks&quot;, &quot;Warm Summer Rain&quot; and &quot;The Jacket&quot;, while tracks have been used in advertisements, including for Nissan and for Japan Railways.

Eno has recorded solo albums for, and established an online shop via, the UK-based internet label Burning Shed. In 2007, he contributed to the &quot;Mid/Air&quot; LP by Dive Index, a collaborative music project of composer/producer Will Thomas.

In 2013 Eno released the album, &quot;Endless City / Concrete Garden&quot;, under the name Roger Eno / Plumbline, and a collection of Eno&#x27;s work from 1988 to 1998, &quot;Little Things Left Behind&quot;.

In 2015, Eno featured playing piano on two tracks (&quot;A Boat Lies Waiting&quot; and &quot;Beauty&quot;) on David Gilmour&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Rattle That Lock&quot;.

On 10 November 2017, Eno released a solo album, &quot;This Floating World&quot;, on Recital Records.

On 23 June 2019, he performed at the Dark Mofo in Hobart, Tasmania.

Roger performed for the first time with his brother Brian at the Acropolis on 4 August 2021.

<doc id="1138566" wikidata="Q1581130" url="?curid=1138566" title="Full-rigged ship">
<text>A full-rigged ship or fully rigged ship is a sailing vessel with a sail plan of three or more masts, all of them square-rigged. Such a vessel is said to have a ship rig or be ship-rigged, with each mast stepped in three segments: lower, top, and topgallant. 

Other large, multi-masted sailing vessels may be regarded as &quot;ships&quot; while lacking one of the elements of a full-rigged ship, such as having one or more masts support only a fore-and-aft sail or a mast of only two segments.

==Masts==
The masts of a full-rigged ship, from bow to stern, are:
* Foremast, which is the second tallest mast
* Mainmast, the tallest
* Mizzenmast, the third tallest
* Jiggermast, which may not be present but will be fourth tallest if so

If the masts are of wood, each mast is in three or more pieces. They are (in order, from bottom up):
* Th&quot;e mast or the lower.&quot;
* Topmast
* Topgallant mast
* Royal mast, if fitted

On steel-masted vessels, the masts are not constructed in the same way, but the corresponding sections of the mast are still named after the traditional wooden sections.

==Sails==
The lowest and normally largest sail on a mast is the course sail of that mast, and is referred to simply by the mast name: Foresail, mainsail, mizzen sail, jigger sail or more commonly forecourse etc.

Even a full-rigged ship did not usually have a lateral (square) course on the mizzen mast below the mizzen topmast. Instead, the lowest sail on the mizzen was usually a fore/aft sail—originally a lateen sail, but later a gaff sail called a spanker or driver. The key distinction between a ship and a barque (in modern usage) is that a ship carries a square-rigged mizzen topsail (and therefore that its mizzen mast has a topsail yard and a cross-jack yard) whereas the mizzen mast of a barque has only fore-and-aft rigged sails. The cross-jack yard was the lowest yard on a ship&#x27;s mizzen mast. Unlike the corresponding yards on the fore and main mast it did not usually have fittings to hang a sail from: its purpose was to control the lower edge of the topsail. In the rare case, the cross-jack yard did carry a square sail, that sail would be called the cross-jack rather than the mizzen course.

The full set of sails, in order from bottom to top, are:

* Course sail

* Topsail, or
** Lower topsail, if fitted.
** Upper topsail, if fitted.
* Topgallant sail, or
** Lower topgallant sail, if fitted.
** Upper topgallant sail, if fitted.
* Royal sail, if fitted.
*Skysail, if fitted.
*Moonraker, if fitted.

The division of a sail into upper and lower sails was a matter of practicality, since undivided sails were larger and, consequently, more difficult to handle. Larger sails necessitated hiring, and paying, a larger crew. Additionally, the great size of some late-19th and 20th century vessels meant that their correspondingly large sails would have been impossible to handle had they not been divided.

Jibs are carried forward of the foremast, are tacked down on the bowsprit or jib-boom and have varying naming conventions.

Staysails may be carried between any other mast and the one in front of it or from the foremast to the bowsprit. They are named after the mast from which they are hoisted, so for example a staysail hoisted to the top of the mizzen topgallant on a stay running to the top of the main topmast would be called the &quot;mizzen topgallant staysail&quot;.

In light winds studding sails (pronounced &quot;stunsls&quot;) may be carried on either side of any or all of the square rigged sails except royals and skysails. They are named after the adjacent sail and the side of the vessel on which they are set, for example &quot;main topgallant starboard stu&#x27;nsail&quot;. One or more spritsails may also be set on booms set athwart and below the bowsprit.

One or two spankers are carried aft of the aftmost mast, if two they are called the &quot;upper spanker&quot; and &quot;lower spanker&quot;. A fore-and-aft topsail may be carried above the upper or only spanker, and is called the &quot;gaff sail&quot;.

To stop a full-rigged ship, except when running directly down wind, the sails of the foremast are oriented in the direction perpendicular to those of the mainmast. Thus, the masts cancel out of their push on the ship. This allows the crew to stop and quickly restart the ship without retracting and lowering the sails, and to dynamically compensate for the push of the wind on the masts themselves and the yards. Running downwind the sails still need to be lowered to bring the ship to a halt.

<doc id="1138577" wikidata="Q2215985" url="?curid=1138577" title="Franta Belsky">
<text>František Bělský (as artist used the name Franta Belsky; in Czech Franta Bělský, 6 April 1921 – 5 July 2000) was a Czech-British sculptor.

He was known for large-scale abstract works of public art as well as more iconographic statues and busts of noted 20th-century figures such as Winston Churchill and members of the British Royal Family.

==Biography==
He was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1921, the son of the economist Josef Bělský. His family stemmed originally from the village of Bělá, hence the toponymic surname Bělský. With his family, he fled to the United Kingdom after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, and volunteered for the Czechoslovak Exile Army. He fought in the Battle of France as a gunner and was twice mentioned in dispatches, once for carving a memorial stone to Czechoslovak soldiers whilst stationed at Cholmondeley, Cheshire, and again in 1944 when he was awarded the Czech bravery award for repairing a telephone line in France while under enemy fire.

In 1940, the Czechoslovak Exile Army was evacuated to Britain along with other Allied forces in the Dunkirk evacuation. Five weeks later, the Czechoslovaks were presented in a military parade for ceremonial inspection by the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Belsky recalled that Churchill stopped in front him, leaning on his walking stick with his chin thrust out, holding his hat in his hand, and looked Belsky in the eye for a prolonged time. Under Churchill&#x27;s gaze, Belsky thought, &quot;You wait, one day I shall model a statue of you, just like this&quot;.

==Career==
Belsky was demobbed and returned to Prague after the war, where he found that many of his relations were murdered in the Holocaust. He studied under the sculptor Otakar Španiel at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague. While in Prague, he also designed a paratroop memorial, and a medal in honour of the Czech Olympic athlete Emil Zátopek, before fleeing again to escape the Communist takeover in 1948.

Belsky continued his studies at the Royal College of Art, studying under Frank Dobson and John Skeaping, graduating with an Honours Diploma in 1950. He received his first public commission for the Festival of Britain in 1951. A number of commissions followed, and was awarded the medal for sculpture by the Paris Salon, winning bronze in 1955 and silver in 1956.

His work included not only traditional statues and busts, but also large-scale more abstract works. He produced a number of statues of Winston Churchill; his 1969 statue at the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library in Fulton, Missouri was commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech. Belsky&#x27;s royal busts are in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Belsky was the first foreign-born sculptor to create a work for Trafalgar Square, a bust of Admiral Cunningham unveiled in 1970. Belsky&#x27;s statue of Lord Louis Mountbatten stands in Horse Guards Parade in London, and in the National Theatre is his statue of Lord Cottesloe. Belsky also designed the &quot;Torsion&quot; Fountain at the Shell Centre in London and the &quot;Totem&quot; sculpture which was erected in 1977 in the Arndale Centre, Manchester. His studio was at his cottage in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire.

In 1990, Belsky returned to Prague and worked on two monumental works, a statue of Winston Churchill outside the British Embassy and a memorial to Czechoslovaks who had served with the British Royal Air Force.
Belsky was awarded the Medal of Merit by the then President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, in 1999.

Among other honors Belsky won the Otto Beit Medal of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1976 for excellence in sculpture.

==Personal life==
In 1944, he married Margaret Owen the newspaper cartoonist, who signed her own work &quot;Belsky&quot;. After her death in 1989, in 1996 he remarried fellow sculptor Irena Sedlecká.

==Death and burial==
Franta Belsky died in Abingdon-on-Thames from prostate cancer on 5 July 2000. He was buried in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church, Sutton Courtenay.

==Selected works==
Belsky was prolific sculptor and his works are held by local authority collections across Britain, corporate offices and collections in the United States and Europe. His trademark trick was to hide inside his sculptures a newspaper front page, a coin of that year and a signed note inside a Guinness bottle.

<text>In inorganic chemistry, crystal field theory (CFT) describes the breaking of degeneracies of electron orbital states, usually &quot;d&quot; or &quot;f&quot; orbitals, due to a static electric field produced by a surrounding charge distribution (anion neighbors). This theory has been used to describe various spectroscopies of transition metal coordination complexes, in particular optical spectra (colors). CFT successfully accounts for some magnetic properties, colors, hydration enthalpies, and spinel structures of transition metal complexes, but it does not attempt to describe bonding. CFT was developed by physicists Hans Bethe and John Hasbrouck van Vleck in the 1930s. CFT was subsequently combined with molecular orbital theory to form the more realistic and complex ligand field theory (LFT), which delivers insight into the process of chemical bonding in transition metal complexes. CFT can be complicated further by breaking assumptions made of relative metal and ligand orbital energies, requiring the use of inverted ligand field theory (ILFT) to better describe bonding.

==Overview==
According to crystal field theory, the interaction between a transition metal and ligands arises from the attraction between the positively charged metal cation and the negative charge on the non-bonding electrons of the ligand. The theory is developed by considering energy changes of the five degenerate &quot;d&quot;-orbitals upon being surrounded by an array of point charges consisting of the ligands. As a ligand approaches the metal ion, the electrons from the ligand will be closer to some of the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals and farther away from others, causing a loss of degeneracy. The electrons in the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals and those in the ligand repel each other due to repulsion between like charges. Thus the d-electrons closer to the ligands will have a higher energy than those further away which results in the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals splitting in energy. This splitting is affected by the following factors:

* the nature of the metal ion.
* the metal&#x27;s oxidation state. A higher oxidation state leads to a larger splitting relative to the spherical field.
* the arrangement of the ligands around the metal ion.
* the coordination number of the metal (i.e. tetrahedral, octahedral...)
* the nature of the ligands surrounding the metal ion. The stronger the effect of the ligands then the greater the difference between the high and low energy &quot;d&quot; groups.

The most common type of complex is octahedral, in which six ligands form the vertices of an octahedron around the metal ion. In octahedral symmetry the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals split into two sets with an energy difference, Δoct (the crystal-field splitting parameter, also commonly denoted by 10&quot;Dq&quot; for ten times the &quot;differential of quanta&quot;) where the &quot;dxy&quot;, &quot;dxz&quot; and &quot;dyz&quot; orbitals will be lower in energy than the &quot;d&quot;&quot;z&quot;2 and &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;2, which will have higher energy, because the former group is farther from the ligands than the latter and therefore experiences less repulsion. The three lower-energy orbitals are collectively referred to as t2g, and the two higher-energy orbitals as eg. These labels are based on the theory of molecular symmetry: they are the names of irreducible representations of the octahedral point group, Oh.(see the Oh character table) Typical orbital energy diagrams are given below in the section High-spin and low-spin.

Tetrahedral complexes are the second most common type; here four ligands form a tetrahedron around the metal ion. In a tetrahedral crystal field splitting, the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals again split into two groups, with an energy difference of Δtet. The lower energy orbitals will be &quot;d&quot;&quot;z&quot;2 and &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;2, and the higher energy orbitals will be &quot;d&quot;&quot;xy&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;xz&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;yz&quot; - opposite to the octahedral case. Furthermore, since the ligand electrons in tetrahedral symmetry are not oriented directly towards the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals, the energy splitting will be lower than in the octahedral case. Square planar and other complex geometries can also be described by CFT.

The size of the gap Δ between the two or more sets of orbitals depends on several factors, including the ligands and geometry of the complex. Some ligands always produce a small value of Δ, while others always give a large splitting. The reasons behind this can be explained by ligand field theory. The spectrochemical series is an empirically-derived list of ligands ordered by the size of the splitting Δ that they produce (small Δ to large Δ; see also this table):

I− &lt; Br− &lt; S2− &lt; SCN− (S–bonded) &lt; Cl− &lt; NO3− &lt; N3− &lt; F− &lt; OH− &lt; C2O42− &lt; H2O &lt; NCS− (N–bonded) &lt; CH3CN &lt; py &lt; NH3 &lt; en &lt; 2,2&#x27;-bipyridine &lt; phen &lt; NO2− &lt; PPh3 &lt; CN− &lt; CO.

It is useful to note that the ligands producing the most splitting are those that can engage in metal to ligand back-bonding.

The oxidation state of the metal also contributes to the size of Δ between the high and low energy levels. As the oxidation state increases for a given metal, the magnitude of Δ increases. A V3+ complex will have a larger Δ than a V2+ complex for a given set of ligands, as the difference in charge density allows the ligands to be closer to a V3+ ion than to a V2+ ion. The smaller distance between the ligand and the metal ion results in a larger Δ, because the ligand and metal electrons are closer together and therefore repel more.

===High-spin and low-spin===


Ligands which cause a large splitting Δ of the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals are referred to as strong-field ligands, such as CN− and CO from the spectrochemical series. In complexes with these ligands, it is unfavourable to put electrons into the high energy orbitals. Therefore, the lower energy orbitals are completely filled before population of the upper sets starts according to the Aufbau principle. Complexes such as this are called &quot;low spin&quot;. For example, NO2− is a strong-field ligand and produces a large Δ. The octahedral ion [Fe(NO2)6]3−, which has 5 &quot;d&quot;-electrons, would have the octahedral splitting diagram shown at right with all five electrons in the &quot;t&quot;2&quot;g&quot; level. This low spin state therefore does not follow Hund&#x27;s rule.

Conversely, ligands (like I− and Br−) which cause a small splitting Δ of the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals are referred to as weak-field ligands. In this case, it is easier to put electrons into the higher energy set of orbitals than it is to put two into the same low-energy orbital, because two electrons in the same orbital repel each other. So, one electron is put into each of the five &quot;d&quot;-orbitals in accord with Hund&#x27;s rule, and &quot;high spin&quot; complexes are formed before any pairing occurs. For example, Br− is a weak-field ligand and produces a small Δoct. So, the ion [FeBr6]3−, again with five &quot;d&quot;-electrons, would have an octahedral splitting diagram where all five orbitals are singly occupied.

In order for low spin splitting to occur, the energy cost of placing an electron into an already singly occupied orbital must be less than the cost of placing the additional electron into an e&quot;g&quot; orbital at an energy cost of Δ. As noted above, e&quot;g&quot; refers to the
&quot;d&quot;&quot;z&quot;2 and &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;2 which are higher in energy than the t2g in octahedral complexes. If the energy required to pair two electrons is greater than Δ, the energy cost of placing an electron in an e&quot;g&quot;, high spin splitting occurs.

The crystal field splitting energy for tetrahedral metal complexes (four ligands) is referred to as Δtet, and is roughly equal to 4/9Δoct (for the same metal and same ligands). Therefore, the energy required to pair two electrons is typically higher than the energy required for placing electrons in the higher energy orbitals. Thus, tetrahedral complexes are usually high-spin.

The use of these splitting diagrams can aid in the prediction of magnetic properties of co-ordination compounds. A compound that has unpaired electrons in its splitting diagram will be paramagnetic and will be attracted by magnetic fields, while a compound that lacks unpaired electrons in its splitting diagram will be diamagnetic and will be weakly repelled by a magnetic field.

==Stabilization energy==
The crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) is the stability that results from placing a transition metal ion in the crystal field generated by a set of ligands. It arises due to the fact that when the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals are split in a ligand field (as described above), some of them become lower in energy than before with respect to a spherical field known as the barycenter in which all five &quot;d&quot;-orbitals are degenerate. For example, in an octahedral case, the &quot;t2g&quot; set becomes lower in energy than the orbitals in the barycenter. As a result of this, if there are any electrons occupying these orbitals, the metal ion is more stable in the ligand field relative to the barycenter by an amount known as the CFSE. Conversely, the &quot;eg&quot; orbitals (in the octahedral case) are higher in energy than in the barycenter, so putting electrons in these reduces the amount of CFSE.

If the splitting of the &quot;d&quot;-orbitals in an octahedral field is Δoct, the three &quot;t2g&quot; orbitals are stabilized relative to the barycenter by 2/5 Δoct, and the &quot;eg&quot; orbitals are destabilized by 3/5 Δoct. As examples, consider the two &quot;d&quot;5 configurations shown further up the page. The low-spin (top) example has five electrons in the &quot;t2g&quot; orbitals, so the total CFSE is 5 x 2/5 Δoct = 2Δoct. In the high-spin (lower) example, the CFSE is (3 x 2/5 Δoct) - (2 x 3/5 Δoct) = 0 - in this case, the stabilization generated by the electrons in the lower orbitals is canceled out by the destabilizing effect of the electrons in the upper orbitals.

===Optical properties===
The optical properties (details of absorption and emission spectra) of many coordination complexes can be explained by Crystal Field Theory. Often, however, the deeper colors of metal complexes arise from more intense charge-transfer excitations.

<text>John Samuel Yu (; born 12 December 1934) is a Chinese-born Australian paediatrician who was CEO of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children from 1979 until 1997. He was the Australian of the Year for 1996.

==Early life and education==
Born in Nanking (now Nanjing, Jiangsu Province), China, he attended Fort Street High School and the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia. John Yu discovered his passion for paediatric care and after starting work at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in 1961 now called the New Children&#x27;s Hospital, he eventually rose to become Head of Medicine in the hospital and later Chief Executive in 1979.

==Career and later life==
He was the chief executive officer of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children at the time of its relocation from inner-city Camperdown to Westmead in western Sydney in 1995 (The hospital now uses the name The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Westmead in addition to its official title), and was chancellor of the University of New South Wales from 2000 to 2005.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989 and was named Australian of the Year in 1996. He was promoted to Companion of the Order of Australia in 2001. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales.

Yu, as CEO of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, publicly supported a bill introduced by Alan Corbett in the New South Wales Legislative Council to protect children from abuse and excessive physical chastisement. The bill passed in 2001, banning parents striking children above the shoulders (thus preventing neck, head, brain and facial injuries), and requiring that any physical force applied leave only trivial and short-lived signs such as redness (that is, no bruising, swelling, welts, cuts, grazes, internal injuries, emotional trauma, etc.).

On 10 October 2023, Yu was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote in the Indigenous Voice referendum, initiated by psychiatrist Patrick McGorry.

<text>An electricity meter, electric meter, electrical meter, energy meter, or kilowatt-hour meter is a device that measures the amount of electric energy consumed by a residence, a business, or an electrically powered device over a time interval.

Electric utilities use electric meters installed at customers&#x27; premises for billing and monitoring purposes. They are typically calibrated in billing units, the most common one being the kilowatt hour (&quot;kWh&quot;). They are usually read once each billing period.

When energy savings during certain periods are desired, some meters may measure demand, the maximum use of power in some interval. &quot;Time of day&quot; metering allows electric rates to be changed during a day, to record usage during peak high-cost periods and off-peak, lower-cost, periods. Also, in some areas meters have relays for demand response load shedding during peak load periods.

== History ==

The earliest commercial uses of electric energy, in the 1880s, had easily predictable usage; billing was based on the number of lamps or motors installed in a building. However, as usage spread, and especially with the invention of pluggable appliances, it also became more variable, and the electric utilities sought a means to bill customers based on actual rather than estimated usage.

=== Direct current ===
Many experimental types of meter were developed. Thomas Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.

DC meters often measured charge in ampere hours. Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, the reading of the meter was proportional to actual energy consumed. For example, if a meter recorded that 100 ampere hours had been consumed on a 200-volt supply, then 20 kilowatt-hours of energy had been supplied.

An early type of electrochemical meter used in the United Kingdom was the &#x27;Reason&#x27; meter. This consisted of a vertically mounted glass structure with a mercury reservoir at the top of the meter. As current was drawn from the supply, electrochemical action transferred the mercury to the bottom of the column. Like all other DC meters, it recorded ampere hours. Once the mercury pool was exhausted, the meter became an open circuit. It was therefore necessary for the consumer to pay for a further supply of electricity, whereupon, the supplier&#x27;s agent would unlock the meter from its mounting and invert it restoring the mercury to the reservoir and the supply. In practice the consumer would get the supply company&#x27;s agent in before the supply ran out and pay only for the charge consumed as read from the scale. The agent would then reset the meter to zero by inverting it.

In 1885 Ferranti offered a mercury motor meter with a register similar to gas meters; this had the advantage that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption. The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a DC meter by Hermann Aron, who patented it in 1883. Hugo Hirst of the British General Electric Company introduced it commercially into Great Britain from 1888. Aron&#x27;s meter recorded the total charge used over time, and showed it on a series of clock dials.

=== Alternating current ===

The first specimen of the AC kilowatt-hour meter produced on the basis of Hungarian Ottó Bláthy&#x27;s patent and named after him was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction kilowatt-hour meter was already marketed by the factory at the end of the same year. These were the first alternating-current watt-hour meters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters. The AC kilowatt hour meters used at present operate on the same principle as Bláthy&#x27;s original invention. Also around 1889, Elihu Thomson of the American General Electric company developed a recording watt meter (watt-hour meter) based on an ironless commutator motor. This meter overcame the disadvantages of the electrochemical type and could operate on either alternating or direct current.

In 1894 Oliver Shallenberger of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation applied the induction principle previously used only in AC ampere hour meters to produce a watt-hour meter of the modern electromechanical form, using an induction disk whose rotational speed was made proportional to the power in the circuit. The Bláthy meter was similar to Shallenberger and Thomson meter in that they are two-phase motor meter. Although the induction meter would only work on alternating current, it eliminated the delicate and troublesome commutator of the Thomson design. Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.

== Units ==
The most common unit of measurement on the electricity meter is the kilowatt hour [&quot;kWh&quot;], which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one kilowatt over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. Some electricity companies use the SI megajoule instead.

Demand is normally measured in watts, but averaged over a period, most often a quarter- or half-hour.

Reactive power is measured in &quot;thousands of volt-ampere reactive-hours&quot;, (kvarh). By convention, a &quot;lagging&quot; or inductive load, such as a motor, will have positive reactive power. A &quot;leading&quot;, or capacitive load, will have negative reactive power.

Volt-amperes measures all power passed through a distribution network, including reactive and actual. This is equal to the product of root-mean-square volts and amperes.

Distortion of the electric current by loads is measured in several ways. Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. This can lead to a significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.

In addition to metering based on the amount of energy used, other types of metering are available. Meters which measured the amount of charge (coulombs) used, known as ampere hour meters, were used in the early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies. The most common application was in relation to special-purpose meters to monitor charge / discharge status of large batteries. Some meters measured only the length of time for which charge flowed, with no measurement of the magnitude of voltage or current being made. These are only suited for constant-load applications and are rarely used today.

== Operation ==
Electricity meters operate by continuously measuring the instantaneous voltage (volts) and current (amperes) to give energy used (in joules, kilowatt-hours etc.). Meters for smaller services (such as small residential customers) can be connected directly in-line between source and customer. For larger loads, more than about 200 ampere of load, current transformers are used, so that the meter can be located somewhere other than in line with the service conductors. The meters fall into two basic categories, electromechanical and electronic.

=== Electromechanical ===

The most common type of electricity meter is the electromechanical watt-hour meter.

On a single-phase AC supply, the electromechanical induction meter operates through electromagnetic induction by counting the revolutions of a non-magnetic, but electrically conductive, metal disc which is made to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. The current coil similarly consumes a small amount of power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter.

The disc is acted upon by two sets of induction coils, which form, in effect, a two phase linear induction motor. One coil is connected in such a way that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil&#x27;s inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil. This produces eddy currents in the disc and the effect is such that a force is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current and instantaneous voltage. A permanent magnet acts as an eddy current brake, exerting an opposing force proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed proportional to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the odometer in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.

Different phase configurations use additional voltage and current coils.

The disc is supported by a spindle which has a worm gear which drives the register. The register is a series of dials which record the amount of energy used. The dials may be of the &quot;cyclometer&quot; type, an odometer-like display that is easy to read where for each dial a single digit is shown through a window in the face of the meter, or of the pointer type where a pointer indicates each digit. With the dial pointer type, adjacent pointers generally rotate in opposite directions due to the gearing mechanism.

The amount of energy represented by one revolution of the disc is denoted by the symbol Kh which is given in units of watt-hours per revolution. The value 7.2 is commonly seen. Using the value of Kh one can determine their power consumption at any given time by timing the disc with a stopwatch.

formula_1.

Where:
::{{math|&quot;t&quot;}} = time in seconds taken by the disc to complete one revolution,
::{{math|&quot;P&quot;}} = power in watts.

For example, if {{math|&quot;Kh&quot;}} = 7.2 as above, and one revolution took place in 14.4 seconds, the power is 1800 watts. This method can be used to determine the power consumption of household devices by switching them on one by one.

Most domestic electricity meters must be read manually, whether by a representative of the power company or by the customer. Where the customer reads the meter, the reading may be supplied to the power company by telephone, post or over the internet. The electricity company will normally require a visit by a company representative at least annually in order to verify customer-supplied readings and to make a basic safety check of the meter.

In an induction type meter, creep is a phenomenon that can adversely affect accuracy, that occurs when the meter disc rotates continuously with potential applied and the load terminals open circuited. A test for error due to creep is called a creep test.

Two standards govern meter accuracy, ANSI C12.20 for North America and IEC 62053.

=== Electronic ===
Electronic meters display the energy used on an LCD or LED display, and some can also transmit readings to remote places. In addition to measuring energy used, some electronic meters can also record other parameters of the load and supply such as instantaneous and maximum rate of usage demands, voltages, power factor and reactive power used etc. They can also support time-of-day billing, for example, recording the amount of energy used during on-peak and off-peak hours.

The meter has a power supply, a metering engine, a processing and communication engine (i.e. a microcontroller), and other add-on modules such as a real time clock (RTC), a liquid crystal display, infra red communication ports/modules and so on.

The metering engine is given the voltage and current inputs and has a voltage reference, samplers and quantisers followed by an analog to digital conversion section to yield the digitised equivalents of all the inputs. These inputs are then processed using a digital signal processor to calculate the various metering parameters.

The largest source of long-term errors in the meter is drift in the preamp, followed by the precision of the voltage reference. Both of these vary with temperature as well, and vary wildly when meters are outdoors. Characterising and compensating for these is a major part of meter design.

The processing and communication section has the responsibility of calculating the various derived quantities from the digital values generated by the metering engine. This also has the responsibility of communication using various protocols and interface with other addon modules connected as slaves to it.

RTC and other add-on modules are attached as slaves to the processing and communication section for various input/output functions. On a modern meter most if not all of this will be implemented inside the microprocessor, such as the RTC, LCD controller, temperature sensor, memory and analog to digital converters.

=== Communication methods ===
Remote meter reading is a practical example of telemetry. It saves the cost of a human meter reader and the resulting mistakes, but it also allows more measurements, and remote provisioning. Many smart meters now include a switch to interrupt or restore service.

Historically, rotating meters could report their metered information remotely, using a pair of electrical contacts attached to a &quot;KYZ&quot; line.

A KYZ interface is a Form C contact supplied from the meter. In a KYZ interface, the Y and Z wires are switch contacts, shorted to K for a measured amount of energy. When one contact closes the other opens to provide count accuracy security. Each contact change of state is considered one pulse. The frequency of pulses indicates the power demand. The number of pulses indicates energy metered. When incorporated into an electromechanical meter, the relay changes state with each full or half rotation of the meter disc. Each state change is called a &quot;pulse.&quot;

KYZ outputs were historically attached to &quot;totaliser relays&quot; feeding a &quot;totaliser&quot; so that many meters could be read all at once in one place.

KYZ outputs are also the classic way of attaching electricity meters to programmable logic controllers, HVACs or other control systems. Some modern meters also supply a contact closure that warns when the meter detects a demand near a higher electricity tariff, to improve demand side management.

EN 62053-31 (formerly DIN 43864) defines the S0 interface, which is a galvanically isolated open collector output. Voltage and current are limited to 27 V and 27 mA, respectively. Each metered amount of electrical energy produces one impulse with a length of 32-100 ms. The meter constant (pulses per kWh) is programmable on some meters, but often fixed to 1000-10000 pulses per kWh. Other meters implement a similar pulse interface, but with an infrared LED instead of an electrical connection. The interface is also used on other kinds of meters, like water meters.

Many meters designed for semi-automated reading have a serial port that communicates by infrared LED through the faceplate of the meter. In some multi-unit buildings, a similar protocol is used, but in a wired bus using a serial current loop to connect all the meters to a single plug. The plug is often near a more easily accessible point.

In the European Union, the most common infrared and protocol is &quot;FLAG&quot;, a simplified subset of mode C of IEC 61107. In the United States and Canada, the favored infrared protocol is ANSI C12.18. Some industrial meters use protocols for programmable logic controllers, like Modbus or DNP3.

One protocol proposed for this purpose is DLMS/COSEM which can operate over any medium, including serial ports. The data can be transmitted by Zigbee, Wi-Fi, telephone lines or over the power lines themselves. Some meters can be read over the internet. Other more modern protocols are also becoming widely used, like OSGP (Open Smart Grid Protocol).

Electronic meters now also use low-power radio, GSM, GPRS, Bluetooth, IrDA, as well as RS-485 wired link. The meters can store the entire usage profiles with timestamps and relay them at the click of a button. The demand readings stored with the profiles accurately indicate the load requirements of the customer. This load profile data is processed at the utilities for billing and planning purposes.

&quot;AMR&quot; (Automatic Meter Reading) and &quot;RMR&quot; (Remote Meter Reading) describe various systems that allow meters to be checked remotely, without the need to send a meter reader. An electronic meter can transmit its readings by telephone line or radio to a central billing office.

== Monitoring and billing methods ==

=== Commercial uses ===

Large commercial and industrial premises may use electronic meters which record power usage in blocks of half an hour or less. This is because most electricity grids have demand surges throughout the day, and the power company may wish to give price incentives to large customers to reduce demand at these times. These demand surges often correspond to meal times or, famously, to advertisements interrupting popular television programmes.

=== Home energy monitoring ===
{{Main|Home energy monitor}}

A potentially powerful means to reduce household energy consumption is to provide convenient real-time feedback to users so they can change their energy using behaviour. Recently, low-cost energy feedback displays have become available, that may be able to measure energy (Watt-hours), momentary power (wattage), and may additionally be able to measure the MAINS voltage, current, uptime, apparent power, capturing peak wattage and peak current, and have a manually set clock. The display may indicate the power consumption over the week graphically.

A study using a consumer-readable meter in 500 Ontario homes by &quot;Hydro One&quot; showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. &quot;Hydro One&quot; subsequently offered free power monitors to 30,000 customers based on the success of the pilot. Projects such as Google PowerMeter, take information from a smart meter and make it more readily available to users to help encourage conservation.

Plug-in electricity meters (or plug load meters) measure energy used by individual appliances. There are a variety of models available on the market today but they all work on the same basic principle. The meter is plugged into an outlet, and the appliance to be measured is plugged into the meter. Such meters can help in energy conservation by identifying major energy users, or devices that consume excessive standby power. Web resources can also be used, if an estimate of the power consumption is enough for the research purposes. A power meter can often be borrowed from the local power authorities or a local public library.

=== Multiple tariff ===
{{original research|section|date=January 2018}}

Electricity retailers may wish to charge customers different tariffs at different times of the day to better reflect the costs of generation and transmission. Since it is typically not cost effective to store significant amounts of electricity during a period of low demand for use during a period of high demand, costs will vary significantly depending on the time of day. Low cost generation capacity (baseload) such as nuclear can take many hours to start, meaning a surplus in times of low demand, whereas high cost but flexible generating capacity (such as gas turbines) must be kept available to respond at a moment&#x27;s notice (spinning reserve) to peak demand, perhaps being used for a few minutes per day, which is very expensive.

Some multiple tariff meters use different tariffs for different amounts of demand. These are usually industrial meters.

Domestic variable-rate meters generally permit two to three tariffs (&quot;peak&quot;, &quot;off-peak&quot; and &quot;shoulder&quot;) and in such installations a simple electromechanical time switch may be used. Historically, these have often been used in conjunction with electrical storage heaters or hot water storage systems.

Multiple tariffs are made easier by time of use (TOU) meters which incorporate or are connected to a time switch and which have multiple registers.

Switching between the tariffs may happen via ripple control, or via a radio-activated switch. In principle, a sealed time switch can also be used, but is considered more vulnerable to tampering to obtain cheaper electricity. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Radio-activated switching is common in the UK, with a nightly data signal sent within the longwave carrier of BBC Radio 4, 198 kHz. The time of off-peak charging is usually seven hours between midnight and 7:00am GMT/BST, and this is designed to power storage heaters and immersion heaters. In the UK, such tariffs are typically branded &quot;Economy 7&quot;, &quot;White Meter&quot; or &quot;Dual-Rate&quot;. The popularity of such tariffs has declined in recent years, at least in the domestic market, because of the (perceived or real) deficiencies of storage heaters and the comparatively much lower cost of natural gas per kWh (typically a factor of 3-5 times lower). Nevertheless, a sizeable number of properties do not have the option of gas, with many in rural areas being outside the gas supply network, and others being expensive upfront to upgrade to a radiator system.

An Economy 10 meter is also available, which gives 10 hours of cheap off-peak electricity spread out over three timeslots throughout a 24-hour period. This allows multiple top-up boosts to storage heaters, or a good spread of times to run a wet electric heating system on a cheaper electricity rate.

Most meters using &quot;Economy 7&quot; switch the entire electricity supply to the cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period, not just the storage heater circuit. The downside of this is that the daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal (&quot;single rate&quot;) electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent electricity supplier in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day. The equivalent Economy 7 costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day. Timer switches installed on washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and immersion heaters may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period.

=== Smart meters ===
{{Main|Smart meter}}

Smart meters go a step further than simple AMR (automatic meter reading). They offer additional functionality including a real-time or near real-time reads, power outage notification, and power quality monitoring. They allow price setting agencies to introduce different prices for consumption based on the time of day and the season.

Another type of smart meter uses nonintrusive load monitoring to automatically determine the number and type of appliances in a residence, how much energy each uses and when. This meter is used by electric utilities to do surveys of energy use. It eliminates the need to put timers on all of the appliances in a house to determine how much energy each uses.

=== Prepayment meters ===


The standard business model of electricity retailing involves the electricity company billing the customer for the amount of energy used in the previous month or quarter. In some countries, if the retailer believes that the customer may not pay the bill, a prepayment meter may be installed. This requires the customer to make advance payment before electricity can be used. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} If the available credit is exhausted then the supply of electricity is cut off by a relay.

In the UK, mechanical prepayment coin meters used to be common, both in private rented accommodation and residential customers of the electricity boards, the nationalised electricity sector. Disadvantages of these included the need for regular visits to remove the cash, and risk of theft of the cash in the meters by both customers and burglars.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The first automated pre-payment meters were introduced by London Electricity, in conjunction with the Schlumberger Metering based in Felixstowe, UK. They were initially called Key Meters and later renamed Budget Meters. They avoided the 60,000 disconnections for non-payment per annum and the many disadvantages of cash prepayment. They were also popular with customers who wanted a convenient payment method, especially in short term tenancies. Well over 1 million such meters were installed across the UK in the first few years after introduction. Modern solid-state electricity meters, in conjunction with smart cards, have removed these disadvantages and such meters are commonly used for customers considered to be a poor credit risk. In the UK, customers can use organisations such as the Post Office Limited or PayPoint network, where rechargeable tokens (Quantum cards for natural gas, or plastic &quot;keys&quot; for electricity) can be loaded with whatever money the customer has available.

In South Africa, Sudan and Northern Ireland prepaid meters are recharged by entering a unique, encoded twenty digit number using a keypad. This makes the tokens, which may be electronically delivered or printed on a slip of paper at point of purchase, very cheap to produce.

Around the world, experiments are going on, especially in developing countries, to test pre-payment systems. In some cases, prepayment meters have not been accepted by customers. There are various groups, such as the Standard Transfer Specification (STS) association, which promote common standards for prepayment metering systems across manufacturers. Prepaid meters using the STS standard are used in many countries.

=== Time of day metering ===

Time of Day metering (TOD), also known as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, month and year into tariff slots and with higher rates at peak load periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this can be used to automatically control usage on the part of the customer (resulting in automatic load control), it is often simply the customer&#x27;s responsibility to control his own usage or pay accordingly (voluntary load control). This also allows the utilities to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately. See also Demand-side Management (DSM).

TOD metering normally splits rates into an arrangement of multiple segments including on-peak, off-peak, mid-peak or shoulder, and critical peak. A typical arrangement is a peak occurring during the day (non-holiday days only), such as from 1 pm to 9 pm Monday through Friday during the summer and from 6:30 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm during the winter. More complex arrangements include the use of critical peaks that occur during high demand periods. The times of peak demand/cost will vary in different markets around the world.

Large commercial users can purchase power by the hour using either forecast pricing or real-time pricing.
Some utilities allow residential customers to pay hourly rates, such as in Illinois, which uses day ahead pricing.

=== Power export metering ===
{{See also|Net metering}}

Many electricity customers are installing their own electricity generating equipment, whether for reasons of economy, redundancy or environmental reasons. When a customer is generating more electricity than required for his own use, the surplus may be exported back to the power grid. Customers that generate back into the &quot;grid&quot; usually must have special equipment and safety devices to protect the grid components (as well as the customer&#x27;s own) in case of faults (electrical short circuits) or maintenance of the grid (say voltage on a downed line coming from an exporting customers facility).

This exported energy may be accounted for in the simplest case by the meter running backwards during periods of net export, thus reducing the customer&#x27;s recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with a ratchet or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid.

Lately, upload sources typically originate from renewable sources (e.g., wind turbines, photovoltaic cells), or gas or steam turbines, which are often found in cogeneration systems. Another potential upload source that has been proposed is plug-in hybrid car batteries (vehicle-to-grid power systems). This requires a &quot;smart grid,&quot; which includes meters that measure electricity via communication networks that require remote control and give customers timing and pricing options. Vehicle-to-grid systems could be installed at workplace parking lots and garages and at park and rides and could help drivers charge their batteries at home at night when off-peak power prices are cheaper, and receive bill crediting for selling excess electricity back to the grid during high-demand hours.

== Location ==

The location of an electricity meter varies with each installation. Possible locations include on a utility pole serving the property, in a street-side cabinet (meter box) or inside the premises adjacent to the consumer unit / distribution board. Electricity companies may prefer external locations as the meter can be read without gaining access to the premises but external meters may be more prone to vandalism.

Current transformers permit the meter to be located remotely from the current-carrying conductors. This is common in large installations. For example, a substation serving a single large customer may have metering equipment installed in a cabinet, without bringing heavy cables into the cabinet.

=== Customer drop and metering equation ===

Since electrical standards vary in different regions, &quot;customer drops&quot; from the grid to the customer also vary depending on the standards and the type of installation. There are several common types of connections between a grid and a customer. Each type has a different &quot;metering equation.&quot; Blondel&#x27;s theorem states that for any system with N current-carrying conductors, that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy. This indicates that different metering is needed, for example, for a three-phase three-wire system than for a three-phase four-wire (with neutral) system.

In Europe, Asia, Africa and most other locations, single phase is common for residential and small commercial customers. Single phase distribution is less-expensive, because one set of transformers in a substation normally serve a large area with relatively high voltages (usually 230 V) and no local transformers. These have a simple metering equation: Watts = volts x amps, with volts measured from the neutral to the phase wire. In the United States, Canada, and parts of Central and South America similar customers are normally served by three-wire single phase. Three-wire single-phase requires local transformers, as few as one per ten residences, but provides lower, safer voltages at the socket (usually 120 V), and provides two voltages to customers: neutral to phase (usually 120 V), and phase to phase (usually 240 V). Additionally, three-wire customers normally have neutral wired to the zero side of the generator&#x27;s windings, which gives earthing that can be easily measured to be safe. These meters have a metering equation of Watts = 0.5 x volts x (amps of phase A − amps of phase B), with volts measured between the phase wires.

Industrial power is normally supplied as three phase power. There are two forms: three wire, or four wire with a system neutral. In &quot;three wire&quot; or &quot;three wire delta&quot;, there is no neutral but an earth ground is the safety ground. The three phases have voltage only relative to each other. This distribution method has one fewer wire, is less expensive, and is common in Asia, Africa, and many parts of Europe. In regions that mix residences and light industry, it is common for this to be the only distribution method. A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a voltage relative to earth.

In the four-wire three-phase system, sometimes called &quot;four-wire wye&quot;, the safety ground is connected to a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. In the United States, the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type. In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.

In North America, it is common for electricity meters to plug into a standardised socket outdoors, on the side of a building. This allows the meter to be replaced without disturbing the wires to the socket, or the occupant of the building. Some sockets may have a bypass while the meter is removed for service. The amount of electricity used without being recorded during this small time is considered insignificant when compared to the inconvenience which might be caused to the customer by cutting off the electricity supply. Most electronic meters in North America use a serial protocol, ANSI C12.18.

In many other countries the supply and load terminals are in the meter housing itself. Cables are connected directly to the meter. In some areas the meter is outside, often on a utility pole. In others, it is inside the building in a niche. If inside, it may share a data connection with other meters. If it exists, the shared connection is often a small plug near the post box. The connection is often EIA-485 or infrared with a serial protocol such as IEC 62056.

In 2014, networking to meters is rapidly changing. The most common schemes seem to combine an existing national standard for data (e.g. ANSI C12.19 or IEC 62056) operating via the Internet Protocol with a small circuit board for powerline communication, or a digital radio for a mobile phone network, or an ISM band.

== Accuracy ==

Electricity meters are required to register the energy consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. Any significant error in the registered energy can represent a loss to the electricity supplier, or the consumer being over billed. The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. Statutory provisions may also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed.

For the United Kingdom, any installed electricity meter is required to accurately record the consumed energy, but it is permitted to under-read by 3.5%, or over-read by 2.5%. Disputed meters are initially verified with a check meter operating alongside the disputed meter. The final resort is for the disputed meter to be fully tested both in the installed location and at a specialist calibration laboratory. Approximately 93% of disputed meters are found to be operating satisfactorily. A refund of electricity paid for, but not consumed (but not vice versa) will only be made if the laboratory is able to estimate how long the meter has been misregistering. This contrasts with gas meters where if a meter is found to be under reading, it is assumed that it has under read for as long as the consumer has had a gas supply through it. Any refund due is limited to the previous six years.

== Tampering and security ==

Meters can be manipulated to make them under-register, effectively allowing power use without paying for it. 

Power companies often install remote-reporting meters specifically to enable remote detection of tampering, and specifically to discover energy theft. The change to smart power meters is useful to stop energy theft.

When tampering is detected, the normal tactic, legal in most areas of the United States, is to switch the subscriber to a &quot;tampering&quot; tariff charged at the meter&#x27;s maximum designed current{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}. At US$0.095/kWh, a standard residential 50 A meter causes a legally collectible charge of about US$5,000.00 per month. Meter readers are trained to spot signs of tampering, and with crude mechanical meters, the maximum rate may be charged each billing period until the tamper is removed, or the service is disconnected.

A common method of tampering on mechanical disk meters is to attach magnets to the outside of the meter. Strong magnets saturate the magnetic fields in the meter so that the motor portion of a mechanical meter does not operate. Lower power magnets can add to the drag resistance of the internal disk resistance magnets. Magnets can also saturate current transformers or power-supply transformers in electronic meters, though countermeasures are common.

Some combinations of capacitive and inductive load can interact with the coils and mass of a rotor and cause reduced or reverse motion.

All of these effects can be detected by the electric company, and many modern meters can detect or compensate for them.

The owner of the meter normally secures the meter against tampering. Revenue meters&#x27; mechanisms and connections are sealed. Meters may also measure VAR-hours (the reflected load), neutral and DC currents (elevated by most electrical tampering), ambient magnetic fields, etc. Even simple mechanical meters can have mechanical flags that are dropped by magnetic tampering or large DC currents.

Newer computerised meters usually have counter-measures against tampering. AMR (Automated Meter Reading) meters often have sensors that can report opening of the meter cover, magnetic anomalies, extra clock setting, glued buttons, inverted installation, reversed or switched phases etc.

Some tampers bypass the meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers of this type normally increase the neutral current at the meter. Most split-phase residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern tamper-resistant meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.

Disconnecting a meter&#x27;s neutral connector is unsafe because shorts can then pass through people or equipment rather than a metallic ground to the generator or earth.

A phantom loop connection via an earth ground is often much higher resistance than the metallic neutral connector. Even if an earth ground is safe, metering at the substation can alert the operator to tampering. Substations, inter-ties, and transformers normally have a high-accuracy meter for the area served. Power companies normally investigate discrepancies between the total billed and the total generated, in order to find and fix power distribution problems. These investigations are an effective method to discover tampering.

Power thefts in the United States are often connected with indoor marijuana grow operations. Narcotics detectives associate abnormally high power usage with the lighting such operations require. Indoor marijuana growers aware of this are particularly motivated to steal electricity simply to conceal their usage of it.

==Global standards for Electricity Metering==
Electricity meters are governed by various standards worldwide to ensure accuracy, reliability, and interoperability. These standards vary by region and are often based on national or international regulations. Below are the key standards used in different regions.

European Standards
:In Europe, electricity meters are primarily regulated under the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), established by the European Union. MID ensures that electricity meters meet specific technical and operational criteria for accurate billing. Key standards include:
:* EN 50470-1 to EN 50470-3: These standards specify general requirements, particular requirements, and tests for active energy meters.
:* IEC 62052 and IEC 62053 series: Commonly applied for the functional and accuracy performance of electricity meters.

American Standards
:In the United States, the standards are developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Key standards include:
:*ANSI C12 Series: Covering meter accuracy, testing, and performance for residential, commercial, and industrial meters.
:*IEEE 1708: Provides guidelines for testing the cybersecurity of smart meters.

Chinese Standards
:In China, electricity meter standards are governed by the China National Standards (GB), which align with international practices but also reflect specific local requirements:
:*GB/T 17215: Sets the requirements for static electricity meters for active energy.
:*DL/T 645: Specifies the communication protocol for multi-function electricity meters, ensuring interoperability.

Australian Standards
:In Australia, electricity meters adhere to the standards set by Standards Australia and the National Measurement Institute (NMI):

:*AS 62052.11 and AS 62053.21: Align with IEC standards for general requirements and accuracy classes of electricity meters.
:*NMI M 6: Specifies the metrological requirements for electricity meters used for billing.

== Regulation and legislation ==

Following the deregulation of electricity supply markets in many countries, the company responsible for an electricity meter may not be obvious. Depending on the arrangements in place, the meter may be the property of the meter Operator, electricity distributor, the retailer or for some large users of electricity the meter may belong to the customer.

The company responsible for reading the meter may not always be the company which owns it. Meter reading is now sometimes subcontracted and in some areas the same person may read gas, water and electricity meters at the same time.

The introduction of advanced meters in residential areas has produced additional privacy issues that may affect ordinary customers. These meters are often capable of recording energy usage every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. Some meters have one or two IR LEDs on the front: one used for testing and which acts as the equivalent of the timing mark on the older mechanical meters and the other as part of a two-way IR communications port for reading / programming the meter. These IR LEDs are visible with some night vision viewers and certain video cameras that are capable of sensing IR transmissions. These can be used for surveillance, revealing information about peoples&#x27; possessions and behaviour. For instance, it can show when the customer is away for extended periods. Nonintrusive load monitoring gives even more detail about what appliances people have and their living and use patterns.

A more detailed and recent analysis of this issue was performed by the Illinois Security Lab.{{Explain|date=May 2015}}

<text>Wapping Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Salthouse Dock to the north, Queen&#x27;s Dock to the south. King&#x27;s Dock was originally located to the west, but has since been filled in.

==History==
The dock was opened in 1852. It was named after the road it runs alongside and which also gave its name to the Wapping Tunnel.

The large brick warehouse built in 1856 along the eastern side of the dock was designed by Jesse Hartley. The building is of a similar architectural style to the warehouses surrounding the nearby Albert Dock. When originally built, it was long and consisted of five separate sections. Bombed in the May Blitz of 1941, the badly damaged southernmost section was not rebuilt, with only the supporting cast iron columns remaining in situ. The remainder of the building continued in commercial use, even after the dock closed in 1972. The warehouse was restored and converted into residential apartments in 1988 and is Grade II* listed.

<doc id="1138595" wikidata="Q1755884" url="?curid=1138595" title="Surfing with the Alien">
<text>Surfing with the Alien is the second studio album by American rock guitarist Joe Satriani. It was released on October 15, 1987, by Relativity Records. The album is one of Satriani&#x27;s most successful to date and helped establish his reputation as a respected rock guitarist.

==Recording==
The album was recorded on a budget of $13,000. Satriani&#x27;s equipment was limited by the budget, consisting of two Kramer Pacer guitars and an adapted Stratocaster guitar, for which he would change the pickups to get different sounds. His guitar effects included a Roland JC-120, a Marshall &#x27;68 half-stack, and a Rockman.

Due to the limited budget, Satriani had to use whatever studio time and rooms were available, and as a result printed his effects to tape while tracking. This proved fortuitous for &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot;, whose solo was recorded with a malfunctioning Eventide H949 as his allotted studio time nearly ended.

To save money, the album heavily used drum machines, programmed by Bongo Bob Smith, with Jeff Campitelli recording overdubs of hi-hats, cymbals, toms and snares. Satriani stated this gave the music an &quot;awkward charm&quot;, and maintained the combination of loose guitar playing and machine-like drum programming. 

&quot;Satch Boogie&quot; is the only song to fully feature live drums, played by Campitelli. The song was originally recorded to a drum machine pattern, and the quick fade-out disguised the sound of the drum machine being picked up by the amplifier at the end.

== Composition ==
Satriani described the arrangements of the album as follows:&quot;Even though my sensibilities were driving me to be very succinct on the record—with very obvious chorus, bridge, and verse sections—after I tracked the outro to “Surfing,” I dug it so much that it set the template for the rest of the record. As a result, the outros turned into the spots where I could relax a little bit and go nuts.&quot;The heavy metal-influenced &quot;Crushing Day&quot; contains the only solo on the album that was worked out beforehand, due to its length; the others are improvised. Satriani expressed regret for this decision later, as he felt constrained when having to play the song on stage.

A Casio CZ-101 was used to record the flute and orchestral instruments on &quot;Midnight&quot;.

It contains fast and complex songs such as the title track and &quot;Satch Boogie&quot;, which helped to further popularize shred guitar during that time. By contrast slower, melodic songs such as &quot;Always with Me, Always with You&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; provide a change of pace. &quot;Midnight&quot; utilizes the technique of two-handed tapping at high tempo, evoking a Spanish fingerstyle effect. &quot;Ice 9&quot; references the fictional apocalyptic substance from Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover art of the original release depicts the Marvel Comics character Silver Surfer on the front, with the hand of Galactus on the back cover. The artwork, which was licensed from the publisher, is taken from a panel from &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #1 (1982), drawn by John Byrne. Byrne did not receive a royalty for the art&#x27;s use on the album cover. Satriani was unfamiliar with the Silver Surfer and had named the album and title track without the character in mind. However, Jim Kozlowski, the production manager for Relativity Records, was a comic book fan and had used the nickname &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; as a radio DJ name. He suggested using the character for the album cover. Kozlowski presented the album to Marvel and obtained permission to use the character. Subsequently, Marvel Comics has paid homage to Satriani in Silver Surfer comics (&quot;the planet Satriani&quot;) and Satriani has named later compositions after other elements of the Silver Surfer mythos (&quot;Back to Shalla-Bal&quot;, &quot;The Power Cosmic 2000&quot;).

The original license to use the character artwork was time-limited. Though the license was renewed multiple times, in 2018, Satriani and Marvel could not come to terms on a price, and so the cover art was replaced. , digital retailers such as iTunes and Spotify display an alternative artwork that does not feature the Silver Surfer. In 2019 a limited deluxe edition of the album was released featuring a silver guitar headstock in place of the Silver Surfer. The background and font of this new artwork is very similar to the original with minor differences.

==Release and reception==

Released on October 15, 1987, by Relativity Records, &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot; charted at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, proving to be Satriani&#x27;s third highest-charting album in the United States. It remained on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 75 weeks, the longest run of any of his releases. &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot; was certified Gold on February 17, 1989, and Platinum on February 3, 1992, having shipped one million copies in the US. It was Satriani&#x27;s first album to earn platinum certification, and remains his only studio album to have done so.

Two singles from the album reached &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock chart: &quot;Satch Boogie&quot; at No. 22 and &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot; at No. 37. A third single, &quot;Always with Me, Always with You&quot;, received a nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Performance at the 1989 Grammy Awards, while the album itself was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the same event, Satriani&#x27;s first two of many such nominations. Live versions of &quot;Always with Me, Always with You&quot; would later be nominated for Best Rock Instrumental twice more, at the 2002 and 2008 Grammys.

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau snidely referred to Satriani as &quot;the latest guitar god&quot; and felt he is too much of a , because he not only composes but edits his guitar melodies: &quot;Thus he delivers both the prowess cultists demand and the comfort they secretly crave&quot;. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine was more impressed by his technical abilities and praised &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot;, writing that it &quot;can be seen as the gold standard for guitar playing of the mid- to late &#x27;80s, an album that captures everything that was good about the glory days of shred.&quot; According to &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1992), the record &quot;put Satriani on the map. Beautifully played and well-paced, it manages to capture all the icy fire of fusion jazz without losing any of the visceral power of rock &amp; roll&quot;.

==Reissues==
&quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot; has been reissued several times. A remastered edition of the album was first released on July 27, 1999 through Epic Records, which featured expanded liner notes. A second remaster celebrating the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary was released on August 7, 2007 through Epic/Legacy Recordings; this is a double-disc set comprising the album itself with further expanded liner notes, as well as a DVD featuring Satriani&#x27;s live performance at the 1988 Montreux Jazz Festival, music videos for &quot;Always with Me, Always with You&quot; and &quot;Satch Boogie&quot;, and additional bonus material. To promote the 2007 reissue, Satriani played exclusive club gigs in select cities.

The most recent reissue of &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot; was part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot;, released on April 22, 2014 through Legacy Recordings; this is a box set compilation containing newly remastered editions of every Satriani studio album from 1986 to 2013.

For Record Store Day Black Friday 2019, the album was re-released as a limited edition, gatefold cover on colored vinyl. The album included a hype sticker that read, &quot;Surfing is now &#x27;Stripped&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Brand New Limited Edition Features The Original Album + All Of The Backing Tracks. Joe&#x27;s Leads Have Been Removed, Allowing You To Play Lead On This Iconic Album, The Perfect Audiophile Guitar Player Experience.&quot; The release included the original version of the album on red vinyl and the &quot;stripped&quot; version on yellow vinyl.
The album artwork has been modified for this release, showing only the headstock of Joe&#x27;s guitar, instead of the surfer while the background maintains a similar color scheme as the original.

<text>The chlamys (Ancient Greek: , chlamýs, genitive: χλαμύδος, chlamydos) was a type of an ancient Greek cloak. It was worn by men for military and hunting purposes during the Classical, Hellenistic and later periods. By the time of the Byzantine Empire it was, although in a much larger form, part of the state costume of the emperor and high officials. It survived as such until at least the 12th century AD.

The ephaptis (Ancient Greek: ἐφαπτίς) was a similar garment, typically worn by infantrymen.

== Ancient Greece ==

The chlamys was made from a seamless rectangle of woolen material about the size of a blanket, usually bordered. It was normally pinned with a fibula at the right shoulder. Originally it was wrapped around the waist like a loincloth, but by the end of the 5th century BC it was worn over the elbows. It could be worn over another item of clothing but was often the sole item of clothing for young soldiers and messengers, at least in Greek art. As such, the chlamys is the characteristic garment of Hermes (Roman Mercury), the messenger god usually depicted as a young man.

The chlamys was typical Greek military attire from the 5th to the 3rd century BC. As worn by soldiers, it could be wrapped around the arm and used as a light shield in combat.

== Byzantine period ==

The chlamys continued into the Byzantine period, when it was often much larger and usually worn sideways, at least by emperors, and likely made of silk. It was held on with a fibula brooch at the wearer&#x27;s right shoulder and nearly reached the ground at front and back. With the even grander &quot;loros&quot; costume, the &quot;chlamys costume&quot; was the ceremonial wear of Byzantine emperors and the only option for high officials on very formal occasions. It is generally less common in surviving imperial portraits than the &quot;loros&quot; shown on coins, though the large numbers of Byzantine coins that survive provide many examples, with the fibula often the main indication in bust-length depictions.

At the two edges of the cloak were large panels in a contrasting colour called &quot;tablia&quot; (sing. &quot;tablion&quot;), beginning about level with the armpit and reaching down to about the waist; typically only the one on the wearer&#x27;s left is seen in portraits. The emperor alone could wear a purple chlamys with gold tablia; officials sometimes wore white with purple &quot;tablia&quot;, as the two beside Justinian I at Ravenna do. In the miniature shown below the 11th-century emperor wears his open to the side, presumably to allow access to his sword, but the three officials have the opening at the centre of their bodies.

By the Middle Byzantine period all parts of the chlamys were highly decorative, with bright patterned Byzantine silk and tablia and borders heavily embroidered and encrusted with gems. In the 12th century it seems to have begun to fall from favour, although it continued to be shown on coins until the 14th century, which was perhaps long after it was actually worn. Some high officials seem to have continued to wear a version of it long after the emperors had abandoned it. While the &quot;loros&quot; tended to represent the emperor in his religious role, the chlamys represented his secular functions as head of state, head of the administrative corps of the empire and giver of justice.

Among women only the empress is recorded as wearing a chlamys; she was presented with it during the coronation ceremony. In art it is much rarer to see an empress in it than in a &quot;loros&quot;, but in the well-known ivory Romanos ivory (BnF, Paris) Eudokia Makrembolitissa wears one while her husband Constantine X Doukas (r. 1059–1067) wears the &quot;loros&quot;.

<text>Queen&#x27;s Dock is a dock on the River Mersey and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Wapping Dock to the north and Coburg Dock to the south.

==History==
The dock was designed by Henry Berry and opened in 1785. The dock was named in honour of Queen Charlotte, the consort of George III, and it was later expanded by John Foster, Sr. At its largest, the dock consisted of a main basin and two branch docks, which were separated by a graving dock. Branch Dock Number 2 (to the north) has since been filled in and is used as a car park. The graving dock is now straddled by an apartment block, The Keel, which was formerly the HM Revenue and Customs building.

This and the other docks in the southern system were owned by British Waterways, transferred to the Canal &amp; River Trust in 2012.

<text>Coburg Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, in England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Queens Dock to the north, Brunswick Dock to the south.

==History==
The Union Half Tide Basin and Brunswick Basin first existed on the site, which were built c.1817-23. Brunswick Basin was renamed as Coburg Dock in 1840, in honour of Prince Albert, and provided with a -wide river entrance. From 1842, the dock became Jesse Hartley&#x27;s South Dockyard headquarters. Coburg Dock was enlarged in 1858, consuming the Union dock, and enlarged again in 1902. The river entrance fell into disuse and was subsequently sealed up. The dock was used as a repair berth and for grain discharge, having a capacity grain silo. The dock closed in 1972. In 1986, the grain silo near the dock basin was demolished.

South Ferry Basin or &#x27;The Cockle Hole&#x27;, a small open basin to the south, was little known under its own name and often confused as being part of Coburg Dock.

==Present use==

This and the other docks in the southern system were owned by British Waterways, now transferred to the Canal &amp; River Trust. Part of the dock is set aside for moorings within Liverpool Marina. Mariner&#x27;s Wharf, on the north quayside, was built between 1989 and 1997.

<text>:&quot;Brunswick Dock is also the name of a dock in London, which became part of the East India Docks.&quot;

Brunswick Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, in England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Coburg Dock to the north, Toxteth Dock to the south.

==History==
First suggested in 1809, the dock was built by Jesse Hartley between 1827 and 1832, when it opened, specifically for importing timber. The dock was Hartley&#x27;s first. It consisted of two lock entrances from the river. In 1854, Cato, Miller &amp; Company built ships at Brunswick Dock. The dock was rebuilt with a southern extension in 1905 by Anthony George Lyster. The dock closed in 1975, although one lock was reopened in 1987 for small watercraft.

==Present==
The Royal Navy Headquarters for the North of England (RNHQ NE) is on Brunswick Dock, which includes the Royal Naval Reserve shore establishment . The s and are based in the dock. Due to tidal restrictions at Brunswick, however, the two ships spend most of their time at Langton Dock in the North dock system in order to enable them to carry out their &quot;University Royal Naval Unit&quot; training programs more effectively.

This and the other docks in the southern system are owned by the Canal &amp; River Trust, with part of the dock set aside for moorings within Liverpool Marina.

<text>Toxteth Dock was a dock on the River Mersey that was part of the Port of Liverpool. Part of the southern dock system, it was connected to Brunswick Dock to the north and Harrington Dock to the south.

==History==
The dock was originally opened in 1841, enlarged between 1882-8 by George Fosbery Lyster and reopening in 1888.Toxteth Dock railway station was opened in 1893 as part of the Liverpool Overhead Railway. It closed in 1956 and was demolished in 1957. For many years, the dock was home to the Harrison Line. The dock closed in 1972 and has since been filled in.

==Present use==
Most of the dock buildings still exist and are split up into small business units as part of Brunswick Business Park. The Hydraulic Station is Grade II listed, and in modern day in use as a training facility for the British Red Cross. They have drawings and historical documents on display detailing the buildings former use. These list Edmund Kirby as being involved in the refurbishment in 1983.

<text>The University of Botswana (UB) was established in 1982, as the first institution of higher education in Botswana. The university currently has three campuses: one in the capital city Gaborone, one in Francistown, and another in Maun. The University of Botswana is divided into six faculties: Business, Education, Engineering, Humanities, Health Sciences, Science and Social Sciences and the Sir Ketumile Masire Teaching Hospital. UB is ranked 1201–1500 in the world and 21st in sub-Saharan Africa in the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Ranking.

==History==
UB began as a part of a larger university system known as UBBS, or the University of Bechuanaland (Botswana), Basotoland (Lesotho), and Swaziland; which was founded in 1964 to reduce the three countries&#x27; reliance on tertiary education in apartheid-era South Africa. After Botswana and Lesotho became independent in 1966, the university was called the University of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland (UBLS).

In 1975 Lesotho withdrew from the partnership and established its own national university. For several years a joint University of Botswana and Swaziland existed until in the early 1980s the university was amicably divided into two separate national universities. It was at the time of Lesotho&#x27;s initial withdrawal that Botswana, which was among the poorest nations in the world, started the &quot;One Man, One Beast&quot; (motho le motho kgomo) movement. This fundraising campaign formally known as the Botswana University Campus Appeal (BUCA) was spearheaded by the late President Sir Seretse Khama in 1976. The campaign was launched to raise money for the construction of the Botswana Campus of the University of Botswana and Swaziland.

BUCA followed in the wake of unilateral nationalisation of a joint-university campus facility in Roma by the Lesotho government. Batswana (People of Botswana) and other stakeholders made contributions of all types (including cash, cattle, grain, eggs, etc.) towards accomplishing the set target of one million rand. By 1982, the University of Botswana became a reality and remains the oldest institution of higher education in the country. The &quot;One Man, One Beast&quot; (motho le motho kgomo) movement endures today on the university&#x27;s main statue located in front of the new library.

==Administration==

The President or Vice President of Botswana serves as the Chancellor of the University. The top administrator on campus is the Vice Chancellor. There have been five Vice Chancellors of the university:

* 19821984: John Turner, 
* 19841998: Thomas Tlou,
* 19982003: Sharon Siverts,
* 20032011: Bojosi Otlhogile,
* 20112017: Thabo Fako.
*2017–present: Prof. David Norris

==Student life==

Many students live on campus in residence halls. Students that live in the residence halls are served meals on campus refectories.

Campus amenities, include an Olympic-sized swimming pool, an entertainment arena, and sports courts (basketball, tennis, handball, netball and volleyball). The university is adjacent to the National Stadium, which is available for university use. The practice fields outside the stadium are the location for university intramural sports.

The university provides a free medical clinic and counseling services.

== Faculties and Departments ==

=== Faculty of Business ===

The Faculty of Business was established in 1997 following the reorganisation of the School of Accounting and Management Studies under the Faculty of Social Sciences. Under the umbrella of this new faculty, three departments were created to offer specialism in management, marketing, and accounting and finance. The most popular of these is the Bachelor of Accountancy (BAcc) program, which trains students for a professional level accounting certification exams, most notably the ACCA. Many graduates have integrated this degree into tracks such as becoming American CPA&#x27;s or members of the UK&#x27;s CIMA. The faculty offers five degrees:
* Bachelor of Accountancy (BAcc) 
* Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Management 
* Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Marketing
* Bachelor of Information Systems (BIS)
* Bachelor of Finance
* Master of Business Administration (MBA)

=== Faculty of Education ===
This is the oldest faculty in the university. The faculty is composed of eight departments including Lifelong Learning and Community Development, Educational Foundations, Educational Technology, Family and Consumer Sciences, Languages and Social Sciences, Mathematics and Sciences Education, Primary Education and Sports Science. There are fifteen undergraduate programmes: a Master of Education degree with eleven specialisations; a Master of Masters in Lifelong Learning and Community Development program, a Master of Counselling and Human Services programme, two MPhil and PhD programmes and a Post Graduate Diploma in Education.

=== Faculty of Engineering ===
The Faculty of Engineering and Technology was created in 1996 as a result of Botswana Polytechnic being incorporated into UB. The faculty was located approximately from the main UB campus in downtown Gaborone where it is now known as BCET, but it has since been moved to the main campus.

The Faculty provides a wide range of Engineering courses including Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Mining and Mineral Engineering, Industrial Design and Technology. Other courses such as Architecture, Real Estate, Planning Survey are also offered.
It offers Certificate, Diploma, Bachelors and Masters in areas related to Engineering. and the planning courses which takes five years (four years in Botswana and the last year to complete with masters at professional planning institutions).

=== Faculty of Humanities ===
The Faculty of Humanities has ten departments: African languages and literature; Chinese studies; English; French; History; library and information studies; media studies; Portuguese studies. It runs undergraduate and post-graduate courses. The history department includes the archaeology unit. The Confucius Institute at the University of Botswana was established in 2006 as part of the Faculty of Humanities.

=== Faculty of Science ===
The Faculty of Science, which has the largest annual enrollment, began as the School of Science of UBBS in 1971. Its original four departments (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics) were involved only in teaching Part I of the BSc degree programme. In 1975, when the Lesotho campus dissociated from UBBS, the teaching of Part II (years 3 and 4) began in all departments. The departments of environmental science, geology, and computer science were added to the faculty before the University of Botswana came into existence in 1982.

The head of the Environmental Science department, Dr. Segosebe, is also the Chair of Somarelang Tikologo, a local environmental NGO in Gaborone.

=== Faculty of Social Science ===
A number of programmes at the certificate, diploma, degree, and masters levels are offered by the Faculty of Social Sciences. Students admitted into the BA programme are allowed, with the permission of the heads of department, to pursue a combined major in two subjects from departments within the faculty as well as selected departments in other faculties. Degree programmes offered in the faculty include Bachelor of Law, Bachelor of Social Sciences, Bachelor of Social Work, and Master of Public Administration, as well as Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice Studies.

=== School of Medicine ===
The Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) professional degree is a five-year programme. The first two years follow an integrated Problem Based Learning approach. The last three years are clinically structured providing the opportunity to practice in the hospital and community.

A modern building complex, erected on the main university campus to house the medical school was completed in 2012. A 450-bed academic teaching hospital was completed in 2014. On average, a total of 50 medical undergraduates are admitted to the MBBS programme annually.

<text>Harrington Dock was a dock on the River Mersey and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated in the southern dock system, it was connected to Toxteth Dock to the north and Herculaneum Dock to the south. 

==History==
The first dock on the site was known as Egerton Dock, named after the Dukes of Bridgewater, built between 1837-9. The first dock was small, with a -wide entrance, and intended for river and canal boats moving timber. In 1839, Jesse Hartley and his son were employed by a separate private company to design two further small basins on the site, known as Harrington Dock and Harrington Dry Basin. The name of the dock can be traced to the district of Harrington, intended for a planned overflow town for Liverpool which never came to fruition. The district of Harrington, itself, was named in honour of Lady Isabella Stanhope, daughter of William Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Harrington and wife of Charles Molyneux, 1st Earl of Sefton who owned the former Royal Forest of Toxteth Park. The dock was bought and opened in 1844, although not commercially successful. By 1858, the dock primarily traded with the west coast of South America. The land was eventually acquired by the Liverpool Dock Trust. Harrington Dock was enlarged by George Fosbery Lyster between 1875-83 and the new Harrington Dock was opened in 1882.

A tunnel from the Garston and Liverpool Railway emerged at the dock, and the second Herculaneum Dock railway station of the Liverpool Overhead Railway was adjacent to the dock from 1896. The dock was further improved in 1898, by widening the entrances and deepening the dock. Harrington Dock was used by the Elder Dempster Lines and its associated businesses.

The dock closed in 1972 and has since been filled in. Most of the dock buildings still exist and are divided into small business units as part of Brunswick Business Park.

Ibn al-Athir belonged to the Shayban lineage of the large and influential Arab tribe Banu Bakr, who lived across upper Mesopotamia, and gave their name to the city of Diyar Bakr. He is also described to have been of Kurdish origin.

He was the brother of Majd ad-Dīn and Diyā&#x27; ad-Dīn Ibn Athir. Al-Athir lived a scholarly life in Mosul, often visited Baghdad and for a time traveled with Saladin&#x27;s army in Syria. He later lived in Aleppo and Damascus. His chief work was a history of the world, &quot;al-Kamil fi at-Tarikh&quot; (&quot;The Complete History&quot;). 

== Death ==

Ibn al-Athir died in 1232/1233, and was buried in a cemetery in Mosul, at the district of Bab Sinjar. His tomb was built in the 20th century and was located in the middle of a road, after the cemetery was cleared for modernization. It became a site of an erroneous legend, which identified it as a tomb of a female mystic. However, the government later installed a marble stele to indicate that it was Ibn al-Athir&#x27;s tomb. His tomb was also regarded in local Yazidi folklore as being the grave of a girl who married the Emir of Mosul but died of poisoning.

The tomb of Ibn al-Athir was bulldozed by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in June 2014.

<text>The Siegfried Line campaign was a phase in the Western European campaign of World War II, which involved engagments near the German defensive Siegfried Line.

This campaign spanned from the end of Operation Overlord and the push across northern France, which ended on 15 September 1944, and concluded with the opening of the German Ardennes counteroffensive, better known as the Battle of the Bulge.

==Background==

German forces had been routed during the Allied break-out from Normandy. The Allies advanced rapidly against an enemy that put up little resistance. But after the liberation of Paris in late August 1944, the Allies paused to re-group and organise before continuing their advance from Paris to the River Rhine. The pause allowed the Germans to solidify their lines—something they had been unable to do west of Paris.

By the middle of September 1944, the three Western Allied army groups; the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group (Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery) in the north, the United States U.S. 12th Army Group (Lieutenant General Omar Bradley) in the center, and the Franco-American 6th Army Group (Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers) in the south, formed a broad front under the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and his headquarters SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force).

While Montgomery and Bradley each favored relatively direct thrusts into Germany (with Montgomery and Bradley each offering to be the spearhead of such an assault), General Eisenhower disagreed. Instead, he chose a &quot;broad-front&quot; strategy, which allowed the Allies to gain ground from the beaten Germans in all sectors, allowed the advancing Allied forces to support each other.

The rapid advance through France had caused considerable logistical strain, made worse by the lack of any major port other than the relatively distant Cherbourg in western France. Although Antwerp was seen as the key to solving the Allied logistics problems, its port was not open to Allied shipping until the Scheldt estuary was clear of German forces. As the campaign progressed, all the belligerents, Allied as well as German, felt the effects of the lack of suitable replacements for front-line troops.

There were two major defensive obstacles to the Allies. The first was the natural barriers made by the rivers of eastern France. The second was the Siegfried Line, which fell under the command, along with all &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; forces in the west, of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Gerd von Rundstedt.

===Logistics and supply===
Although the breakout from Normandy had taken longer than planned, the advances until September had far exceeded expectations. Bradley, for example, by September had four more divisions than planned and all of his forces were ahead of their expected position. One effect was that insufficient supplies could be delivered to the various fronts to maintain the advance: demand had exceeded the expected needs.

Much war materiel still had to be brought ashore across the invasion beaches and through the one remaining Mulberry harbour (the other had been destroyed in an English Channel storm). Although small harbours, such as Isigny, Port-en-Bessin, and Courcelles, were being used, the major forward ports such as Calais, Boulogne, Dunkirk and Le Havre either remained in German hands as &quot;fortresses&quot; or had been systematically destroyed. The availability of Cherbourg had been valuable until the breakout, but then the shortage of transport to carry supplies to the rapidly advancing armies became the limiting factor.

Although fuel was successfully pumped from Britain to Normandy via the Pluto pipeline, this still had to reach the fronts, which were advancing faster than the pipelines could be extended. The railways had been largely destroyed by Allied attacks and would take much effort to repair, so fleets of trucks were needed in the interim. In an attempt to address this acute shortage of transport, three newly arrived U.S. infantry divisions—the 26th, 95th, and 104th—were stripped of their trucks in order to haul supplies. Advancing divisions of the U.S. 12th Army Group left all their heavy artillery and half their medium artillery west of the Seine, freeing their trucks to move supplies for other units. Four British truck companies were loaned to the Americans. Another 1,500 British trucks were found to have critical engine faults and were unusable, limiting assistance from that quarter. The Red Ball Express was an attempt to expedite deliveries by truck but capacity was inadequate for the circumstances.

The 6th Army Group advancing from southern France were supplied adequately from Toulon and Marseille because it had captured ports intact and the local railway system was less damaged. This source supplied about 25% of the Allied needs.

At this time the main Allied supply lines still ran back to Normandy, presenting serious logistical problems. The solution was to open the port of Antwerp. This major port had been captured at 90% intact on 4 September, but the occupation of Antwerp was not enough as the 21st Army Group failed to gain sea access by clearing the Scheldt estuary. So the port could not be used until 29 November after a protracted campaign by the Canadian First Army; initially the estuary was weakly held, but the German 15th Army was allowed to dig in there.

The delay in securing this area has been blamed on General Eisenhower as the 21st Army Group commander, Field Marshal Montgomery favored Operation Market-Garden and opening the French Channel ports over clearing the approaches to the port of Antwerp in the Battle of the Scheldt. However, even if the Scheldt Estuary had been secured immediately at the start of September, the port of Antwerp would not solve the supply crisis in that month, for the approaches had been mined by the Germans two months earlier, and when finally taken it took one month to clear it.

===Manpower===
The German armies had lost large numbers of troops in Normandy and the subsequent pursuit. To counteract this, about 20,000 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; personnel were reallocated to the German Army, invalided troops were redrafted into the front line and &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units were formed using barely trained civilians.

British manpower resources were limited after five years of war and through worldwide commitments. Replacements were no longer adequate to cover losses and some formations were disbanded to maintain the strength of others. The Canadians were also short of manpower, due to a reluctance to require conscripts to serve outside Canada or Canadian waters. This had arisen from Conscription Crisis of 1917 during World War I; to avoid similar problems in World War II, the National Resources Mobilization Act of 1940 prohibited sending conscripts overseas. However, this provision of the Act was later removed, leading to the Conscription Crisis of 1944.

American losses now called on replacements direct from the United States. They were often inexperienced and not used to the harsh conditions of the latter part of the campaign. There were also complaints about the poor quality of troops released into the infantry from less-stressed parts of the U.S. Army. At one point, after the Battle of the Bulge had highlighted the shortage of infantrymen, the Army relaxed its embargo on the use of black soldiers in combat formations. Black volunteers performed well throughout the phase and prompted a permanent change in military policy.

==Campaign==
===Northern Group of Armies (21st Army Group)===
====Channel ports====

The Channel ports were urgently needed to maintain the Allied armies. By the time that Brussels was liberated, it had become difficult to supply the 21st Army Group adequately. Indeed, one corps—VIII Corps—was withdrawn from active service to free its transport for general use. The Canadian First Army was tasked with liberating the ports during its advance along the French coast. The ports involved were Le Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne, Calais, and Dunkirk in France, as well as Ostend in Belgium. Adolf Hitler had appreciated their strategic value. He issued a Führer Order declaring them to be &quot;fortresses&quot; that must receive adequate materiel for a siege and be held to the last man.

Dieppe was evacuated by the Germans before Hitler&#x27;s order had been received and, consequently, the Canadians took it with little trouble and with the port installations largely intact. Ostend had been omitted from the Führer Order and was also undefended, although demolitions delayed its use. The other ports were defended to varying degrees, however, and they required substantial work to bring them into use, except for Dunkirk which was sealed off to the rear of the Allied advance.

====Market Garden====
The first operation of the Rhineland campaign, &quot;Market Garden&quot;, was commanded by Montgomery and was to secure a bridgehead over the Rhine in the north, at Arnhem, which would outflank the Siegfried Line.

&quot;Market Garden&quot; had two distinct parts. &quot;Market&quot; was to be the largest airborne operation in history, dropping three and a half divisions of American, British, and Polish paratroopers to capture key bridges and prevent their demolition by the Germans. &quot;Garden&quot; was a ground attack by the British Second Army across the bridges. It was assumed that the German forces would still be recovering from the previous campaign and opposition would not be very stiff for either operation.

If successful, the Allies would have a direct route into Germany that bypassed the main German defenses and also seize territory from which the Germans launched V-1s and V-2s against London, Antwerp and elsewhere.

General Eisenhower approved &quot;Market Garden&quot;. On September 10 he gave supply priority to the 21st Army Group and decided to divert the U.S. First Army to the north of the Ardennes to stage limited attacks to draw German defenders south, away from the target sites.
The operation was launched on 17 September. At first, it went well. The U.S. 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions took their objectives at Eindhoven, Veghel and Nijmegen. However, the 82nd failed to capture its main objectives, the Nijmegen bridges, and instead its commander focused on the Groesbeek Heights. Although their landings outside Arnhem were on target, the British 1st Airborne Division landing zones were some distance from Arnhem bridge and only on the north side of the river. Problems arose when the British 1st Airborne Division lost vital equipment—jeeps and heavy anti-tank guns—when gliders crashed. There had also been a severe underestimation of German strength in the area. To make matters worse, poor weather prevented aerial reinforcements and drastically reduced resupply. German resistance to the forces driving to Arnhem was highly effective, and a copy of the Allied battle plan had been captured.

In the end, &quot;Market Garden&quot; was unsuccessful. Arnhem bridge was not held and the British paratroops suffered tremendous casualties—approximately 77% by 25 September. The failure of the 82nd to capture the Nijmegen bridges in a coup de main meant that the British ground forces meant to relieve the 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem were delayed for 36 hours, as the Guards Armoured Division, despite arriving in Nijmegen ahead of schedule, was forced to pour its forces to capture the bridges, instead of simply moving across, as had been planned. The allies managed to hold on to the salient in early October by repelling a German counter offensive.

====Battle of the Scheldt====
The logistics situation was becoming critical, so opening the Port of Antwerp was now a high priority. On 12 September 1944, the Canadian First Army was given the task of clearing the Scheldt of German forces. The 1st Army comprised the II Canadian Corps, which included the Polish 1st Armoured Division, the British 49th and 52nd Divisions and the British I Corps.

The task involved four main operations: The first was to clear the area north of Antwerp and secure access to South Beveland. The second was to clear the Breskens pocket north of the Leopold Canal (Operation Switchback). The third—Operation Vitality—was the capture of South Beveland. The final phase was the capture of Walcheren Island, which had been fortified into a powerful German stronghold.

On 21 September 1944, the advance began. The 4th Canadian Armoured Division, moving north toward the south shore of the Scheldt around the Dutch town of Breskens, were the first Allied troops to face the formidable obstacle of the double line of the Leopold and Dérivation de la Lys Canals. The canals were crossed and a bridgehead established, but fierce counter-attacks by the Germans forced them to withdraw with heavy casualties. The 1st Polish Armoured Division had greater success, moving northeast to the coast, occupying Terneuzen and clearing the south bank of the Scheldt eastward to Antwerp. It was by then clear, however, that any further advances would be at tremendous cost.

The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division began its advance north from Antwerp on 2 October. Heavy casualties ensued, including the almost total destruction of the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade&#x27;s Black Watch Battalion on 13 October. However, on 16 October Woensdrecht was taken, following an immense artillery barrage which forced the Germans back. This cut South Beveland and Walcheren off from the mainland and achieved the objective of the first operation.

Montgomery issued a directive that made the opening of the Scheldt estuary the top priority. To the east, the British Second Army attacked westward to clear the Netherlands south of the Meuse (&quot;Maas&quot;). This helped secure the Scheldt region from counter-attack.

In Operation Switchback, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division mounted a two-pronged attack, with the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade crossing the Leopold Canal and the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade launching an amphibious assault from the coastal side of the pocket. Despite fierce resistance from the Germans, the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade crossed the Leopold Canal and the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade moved southwards, opening a supply route into the pocket.

&quot;Operation Vitality&quot;—the third major phase of the Battle of the Scheldt—began on 24 October. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division began its advance toward South Beveland, but was slowed by mines, mud and strong enemy defences. The British 52nd Division made an amphibious attack to get in behind the Germans&#x27; Beveland Canal defensive positions. Thus, this formidable defence was outflanked, and the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade began a frontal attack in assault boats. The engineers were able to bridge the canal on the main road. With the canal line gone, the German defence crumbled and South Beveland was cleared. The third phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was now complete.

The final phase, Operation Infatuate was the attack on the heavily fortified island of Walcheren at the mouth of the West Scheldt. The island&#x27;s dykes were breached by attacks from RAF Bomber Command on 3, 7, and 11 October. This flooded the central part of the island, forcing the German defenders onto the high ground and allowing the use of amphibious vehicles. Units of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacked the causeway on 31 October, and after a grim struggle, established a precarious foothold. They were relieved by a battalion of the British 52nd Division. In conjunction with the waterborne attacks, the 52nd continued the advance.
The amphibious landings began on 1 November with units of the British 155th Infantry Brigade landing on a beach in the south-eastern area of Vlissingen. During the next few days, they engaged in heavy street fighting against the German defenders. Also on 1 November, after a heavy naval bombardment by the British Royal Navy, troops of 4th Commando Brigade, (with units of 10th Inter Allied Commando, consisting mainly of Belgian and Norwegian troops), supported by specialised armoured vehicles of the British 79th Armoured Division were landed on both sides of the gap in the sea dyke. Heavy fighting ensued. A smaller force moved south-eastward, toward Vlissingen, while the main force went northeast to clear the northern half of Walcheren to link up with the Canadians who had established a bridgehead on the eastern part of the island. Fierce resistance was again offered by German troops defending the area, and fighting continued until 7 November. However, the action ended on 8 November after a force of amphibious vehicles entered Middelburg, the capital of Walcheren.

Meanwhile, Operation Pheasant was launched in on October 20 which was intended as a major operation to clear German troops from the Province of North Brabant in conjunction with the battle of the Scheldt. The offensive after some resistance liberated most of region; the cities of Tilburg, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Willemstad and Roosendaal were liberated by British forces. Bergen Op Zoom was taken by the Canadians and the Polish 1st Armoured Division led by General Maczek liberated the city of Breda. As a result, the German positions which had defended the region along its canals and rivers had been broken. The operation was also a success in that civilian casualties were relatively light.

Meanwhile, the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had pushed eastwards past Bergen-op-Zoom to Sint Philipsland where it sank several German vessels in Zijpe harbour. With the approaches to Antwerp free, the fourth phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was complete; on 28 November, the first convoy entered the port.

===Central Group of Armies (12th Army Group)===
====Northern France and Belgium====
The US First Army advanced rapidly through northern France and Belgium during late August and early September, with its main goal being to reach the Rhine before the Germans could establish defensive positions there. During the Battle of the Mons Pocket the Allies encircled approximately 70,000 Germans near Mons in Belgium, and took around 25,000 prisoners. 

====Aachen====

The U.S. First Army was focused on capturing the city of Aachen, which had to be dealt with before advancing to assault the Siegfried Line itself. Initially, the city of Aachen was to be bypassed and cut off in an attempt by the Allies to imitate the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; tactics the Germans had so effectively used (see below). However, the city was the first to be assaulted on German soil and so had huge historical and cultural significance for the German people. Hitler personally ordered that the garrison there be reinforced and the city held. This forced the Allied commanders to re-think their strategy.

Some historians, including Stephen E. Ambrose, have suggested that the siege of Aachen was a mistake. The battle stalled the eastward advance by the Allies and caused approximately 5,000 Allied casualties. The fighting was, by all accounts, brutal street-to-street, house-to-house style urban combat and tied up the available resources of the advancing Allied armies. Ambrose has suggested that a more effective strategy would have been to isolate the garrison at Aachen and continue the move east into the heart of Germany. In theory, this would have eliminated the ability of the German garrison to operate as a fighting force by cutting off their supply lines. This might have forced them to surrender or to move out of the city in an attempt to re-establish their supply lines. In the case of the latter, a confrontation in a more neutral setting would probably have resulted in fewer military and civilian casualties.

====Lorraine====
In late August, the U.S. Third Army started to run low on fuel. This situation was caused by the rapid Allied advance through France, and compounded by the shift of logistical priority to the northern forces to secure Antwerp. By 1 September 1944, with the last of its fuel, the Third Army managed one final push to capture key bridges over the Meuse River at Verdun and Commercy. Five days after that, however, the critical supply situation effectively caused the Third Army to grind to a halt, allowing previously routed German forces to regroup and the reinforcement of their strongholds in the area.

Soon after, the Third Army came up against Metz, part of the Maginot Line and one of the most heavily fortified cities in Western Europe. The city could not be bypassed, as several of its forts had guns directed at Moselle crossing sites and the main roads in the area. It could also be used as a stronghold to organize a German counter-attack to the Third Army&#x27;s rear. In the following Battle of Metz, the Third Army, while victorious, took heavy casualties.

Following Metz, the Third Army continued eastwards to the Saar River and soon began their assault on the Siegfried Line.

====Hürtgen Forest====

Hürtgen Forest was seen as a possible location for incursions into the American flank, and the river dams in the area were a threat to the Allied advance downstream, so the Allies launched an assault to clear the area of German resistance on 19 September 1944. German defence was more stubborn than expected and the terrain was highly favourable to defence, largely negating the American advantages of numbers and quality of troops. The battle—expected to last a few weeks—continued until February 1945 and cost 33,000 casualties (from all causes).

The value of the battle has been disputed. Modern historians argue that the outcome was not worth the foreseeable losses, and in any case, the American tactics played into German hands.

====Operation Queen====
Operation Queen was a combined Allied air-ground offensive against the German forces at the Siegfried Line, which was conducted mainly by the combined effort of the U.S. Ninth and First Armies. The principal goal of the operation was to advance to the Roer River and to establish several bridgeheads over it, for a subsequent thrust into Germany to the Rhine River. Parts of this operation also included further fighting in the Hurtgen Forest. The offensive commenced on 16 November with one of the heaviest tactical air bombardments by the western Allies of the war. Although the German forces were heavily outnumbered, the Allied advance was very slow. After four weeks of intensive fighting, the Allies reached the Roer, but were not able to establish any bridgeheads over it. Fighting in the Hurtgen Forest also bogged down. The exhaustive fighting during &quot;Queen&quot; caused the Allied troops to suffer heavy casualties, and eventually the Germans launched their own counteroffensive—Operation &quot;Wacht am Rhein&quot;—on 16 December, which would lead to the Battle of the Bulge.

==Aftermath==

===Winter counter-offensives===
The Germans had been preparing a massive counter-attack in the West since the Allied breakout from Normandy. The plan called &quot;Wacht am Rhein&quot; (&quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;) was to attack through the Ardennes and swing north to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16 December in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the U.S. First Army. After initial German successes in bad weather, which gave them cover from the Allied air forces, the Allies launched a counterattack to clear them from the Ardennes. The Germans were eventually pushed back to their starting points by 25 January 1945.

The Germans launched a second, smaller offensive (&quot;Nordwind&quot;) into Alsace on 1 January 1945. Aiming to recapture Strasbourg, they attacked the 6th Army Group at multiple points. Because Allied lines had become severely stretched in response to the crisis in the Ardennes, holding and throwing back the &quot;Nordwind&quot; offensive was a costly affair that lasted almost four weeks. Allied counter-attacks restored the front line to the area of the German border and collapsed the Colmar Pocket.

===Germany west of the Rhine ===

The pincer movement of the Canadian First Army, advancing from the Nijmegen area in Operation Veritable, and the U.S. Ninth Army, crossing the Roer in Operation Grenade, was planned to start on 8 February 1945, but it was delayed by two weeks when the Germans flooded the Roer valley by destroying the floodgates of two dams on the upper Roer (Rur Dam and Urft Dam). During the two weeks that the little river was flooded, Hitler did not allow Rundstedt to withdraw German forces behind the Rhine, arguing that it would only delay the inevitable fight. Hitler ordered him to fight where his forces stood.

By the time the water had subsided and the U.S. Ninth Army was able to cross the Roer on 23 February, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine&#x27;s west bank. The German divisions that had remained on the west bank of the Rhine were cut to pieces, and 280,000 men were taken prisoner. The stubborn German resistance had been costly; their total losses reached an estimated 400,000 men.
The Allies crossed the Rhine at four points. One crossing was an opportunity taken by U.S. forces when the Germans failed to blow up the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen; another was a hasty assault; and two crossings were planned:
* The U.S. First Army aggressively pursued the disintegrating German troops, and on 7 March they unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge across the Rhine River at Remagen. The 9th Armored Division quickly expanded the bridgehead into a full scale crossing.
* Bradley told General George S. Patton—whose U.S. Third Army had been fighting through the Palatinate—to &quot;take the Rhine on the run&quot;. The Third Army did just that on the night of 22/23 March, crossing the river with a hasty assault south of Mainz at Oppenheim.
* In the north, the Rhine is twice as wide, with a far higher volume of water than where the Americans crossed. Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, decided it could be crossed safely only with a carefully prepared attack. In Operation Plunder he crossed the Rhine at Rees and Wesel on the night of 23/24 March, including the largest single drop airborne operation in history, Operation Varsity.
* In the Allied 6th Army Group area, the U.S. Seventh Army assaulted across the Rhine in the area between Mannheim and Worms on 26 March. A fifth crossing on a smaller scale was later achieved by the French First Army at Speyer.

After crossing the Rhine, the Allies rapidly advanced into Germany&#x27;s heartland. The end of World War II in Europe followed soon after with the surrender of Germany on May 7.

<doc id="1138645" wikidata="Q2637018" url="?curid=1138645" title="Alarmism">
<text>Alarmism is excessive or exaggerated alarm of a real or imagined threat. Alarmism connotes attempts to excite fears or giving warnings of great danger in a manner that is amplified, overemphasized or unwarranted. In the news media, alarmism can often be found in the form of yellow journalism where reports sensationalise a story to exaggerate small risks.

==Alarmist personality==
The alarmist person is subject to the cognitive distortion of catastrophizingof always expecting the worst of possible futures.

They may also be seeking to preserve feelings of omnipotence by trying to generate anxiety, apprehension and concern in others.

<text>Budjak, also known as Budzhak, is a historical region that was part of Bessarabia from 1812 to 1940. Situated along the Black Sea, between the Danube and Dniester rivers, this multi-ethnic region covers an area of and is home to approximately 600,000 people. The majority of the region (former Izmail Oblast) is now located in Ukraine&#x27;s Odesa Oblast, while the remaining part is found in the southern districts of Moldova. The region is bordered to the north by the rest of Moldova, to the west and south by Romania, and to the east by the Black Sea and the rest of Ukraine.
==Name and geography==
Historically, Budjak was the southeastern steppe region of Moldavia. Bordered by the northern Trajan&#x27;s Wall at its north end, by the Danube river and Black Sea to its south, by Tigheci Hills (just east of the Prut River) to the west, and Dniester River to the east, it was known as &quot;historic Bessarabia&quot; until 1812, when this name was given to the larger region situated between the two rivers, including Budjak. As used in the Middle Ages, the term might (if referring to the geographical area) or might not (if referring to the area predominated by Nogai Tatars) include the environs of Akkerman, Bender, and Kiliia.

The name Budjak itself was given to the area during Ottoman rule (1484–1812) and derives from the Turkish word &quot;bucak&quot;, meaning &quot;borderland&quot; or &quot;corner&quot;, referring roughly to the land between what was then Akkerman (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi), Bender, and Ismail (now Izmail).

After 1812, the term Bessarabia came to apply to all of Moldavia east of the Prut River. Consequently, Budjak is sometimes referred to as &quot;Southern Bessarabia&quot;.

After the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia in 1940, its southern part, which along with its northern part was included in the Ukrainian SSR (unlike the rest of Bessarabia, which was included in the Moldavian SSR), became known as Budjak, thus being slightly smaller than the historical term.

Besides Southern Bessarabia, other descriptive terms that have been applied to the region include &quot;Bulgarian Bessarabia&quot; (, translit. &quot;Bolhars&#x27;ka Bessarabiia&quot;), &quot;Akkermanshchyna&quot; (), and &quot;Western Odesa Oblast&quot; (, translit. &quot;Zakhidna Odeshchyna&quot;).

The area has been termed variously in the English language, including Budjak, Budzhak, Bujak and Buchak. The name has a number of spellings in languages of the region: &quot;Budziak&quot; in Polish, &quot;Bugeac&quot; in Romanian, &quot;Buxhak&quot; in Albanian, &quot;Bucak&quot; in Turkish, and Буджак in Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and Russian, all pronounced more or less like .

==History==

===Early history===
The Budjak culture of the North-West Black Sea region is considered to be important in the context of the Pit-Grave or Yamnaya culture of the Pontic steppe, dating to 3,600–2,300 BC. In particular, Budjak may have given rise to the Balkan-Carpathian variant of Yamnaya culture.

In Classical antiquity, Budjak was inhabited by Tyragetae, Bastarnae, Scythians, and Roxolani. In 6th century BC Ancient Greek colonists established a colony at the mouths of Dnister river, Tyras. Around 2nd century BC, also a Celt tribe settled at Aliobrix (present day Cartal/Orlovka).

Budjak area, the northern Lower Danube, was described as the &quot;wasteland of the Getae&quot; by the ancient Greek geographer Strabo (1st century BC). In fact, based on recent archaeological research, in this period of time, the area was most likely populated by sedentary farmers; among them were the Dacians and the Daco-Romans. The nomad peoples, such as the Sarmatians also passed through the area.

The Romans acquired the area in the 1st century AD, rebuilt and encamped Tyras and Aliobrix. As with the rest of the port cities around the Black Sea, the local population absorbed a mixture of Greek and Roman cultures, with Greek being mainly the language of trade, and Latin the language of politics. After the division of the Roman Empire in 395, the area was included in the East Roman or Byzantine Empire. From the 1st century AD until the invasion of the Avars in 558, the Romans had established cities (&quot;poleis&quot;), military camps and some stations for the veterans and for the colons (&quot;apoikion&quot;) sent by the emperors.

The area lay along the predominant route for migratory peoples, as it was the westernmost portion of the Euro-Asian steppe. Going westward, only the banks of the Dniester and Danube rivers were less forested comparatively to the surrounding areas (which nowadays form Moldova and Romania), therefore providing a natural route for herdsmen all the way from Mongolia to the Pannonian Plains (modern Hungary). The region, therefore, passed as a temporary settling ground for the Huns under the leader Uldin (387), the Avars (558–567), the Slavs (end of 6th century), the Bulgars under Asparuh (679), the Magyars (9th century), the Pechenegs (11th century, and again 12th century), the Cumans (12th century) and others.

Although the Byzantines held nominal suzerainty of the region (at least of the sea shore) until the 14th century, they had little or no sway over the hinterland.

In the early Middle Ages a Tigheci &quot;Republic&quot; was formed by several villages occupying the nearby Tigheci hills, in order to offer more security for themselves, while the steppe area between that and the seashore, unsuited for agriculture due to lack of water and frequently invaded by Eastern populations, remained void of permanent settlements. From the 7th to the 12th centuries, the region was under the authority of the First Bulgarian Empire, Pechenegs, and later of Cumans, who irregularly collected tribute from the indigenous villagers.

===Moldavian and Ottoman rule===
After the Mongol invasion of 1241, the rebuilt coastal cities of Budjak (Maurocastro and Licostomo) came under the domination of Genoese traders. The interior however remained under the direct Mongol rule of the Golden Horde. Sometime during the 14th century Wallachia&#x27;s princes of the House of Basarab extended their authority over part of the territory. The region remained under Wallachian influence until the early 15th century, during the reign of Mircea the Elder, when the area was integrated into Moldavia by prince Alexander the Kind. Nogai Tatars, who had settled herds in the region after the 1240s, inhabited the steppe, while Romanians inhabited the surrounding hills and the port cities.

In 1484 Stephen the Great of Moldavia was forced to surrender the two main fortresses of Chilia (Kiliia) and Cetatea Albă (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi) to the Ottoman Empire, the last Black Sea ports to fall into Ottoman hands. In 1538 the Ottomans forced prince Petru Rareș of Moldavia to give up the fortress-city Tighina as well.

Under the Ottomans, Tighina was renamed Bender, while Chilia lost importance due to the construction of the Ismail (Izmail) fortress at the location of the Moldavian village Smil. Despite returning from Muslim to Orthodox Christian sovereignty, the latter names were retained by the Russian Empire.

Under Ottoman rule, the three major cities each were the center of a sanjak, and were together officially part of Silistra (or Özi) Eyalet although Bender was north of Trajan&#x27;s Wall and outside of the steppe region. The Nogai Tatar-inhabited steppe, which then acquired the name Budjak, served as a buffer area between these sanjaks and the Principality of Moldavia. Although it was a tributary of the Ottoman Empire, Moldavia was independent in its internal affairs until the start of the Russo-Turkish Wars forced the Ottomans to ensure that the Romanian princes did not switch sides too often.

===Modern history===

During the Napoleonic Era, Budjak was overrun by Russia in the course of the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812. The 1812 Treaty of Bucharest transferred the territories of Moldavia and the Ottoman Empire east of the Prut River and north of the Danube, including Budjak, to Russian control. With the Russian annexation, the name Bessarabia began to be applied not only to the original southern region, but to the entire eastern half of historical Moldavia acquired by the Russian Empire, while Budjak was applied to southern Bessarabia, mainly to the steppe.

With Russia&#x27;s 1856 defeat in the Crimean War, a part of southern Bessarabia including a part of Budjak (Reni, Izmail, Bolhrad, Kiliia) was ceded by the Russian Empire back to the Principality of Moldavia, which soon united with Wallachia to form the United Principalities (which was made a personal union in 1859 to then be deepened into a full union in 1862, as the Principality of Romania). Following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the Treaty of San Stefano and the Treaty of Berlin recognized the full independence of the new Kingdom of Romania (the principalities that formed it had already been &quot;de facto&quot; independent for half a century), but transferred the territories subject to the 1856 re-configuration back to the Russian Empire.

After World War I, Budjak, which was part of the Russian Bessarabia Governorate that voted to join Romania, was administered as parts of Tighina, Ismail, and Cetatea Albă counties (judeţe). As the region was inhabited by non-Romanian majorities, it initially witnessed several revolts against the central authorities, such as the Bender Uprising of 1919 and the Tatarbunary Uprising of 1924.

In 1939, the secret appendix to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact assigned Bessarabia to the Soviet Union&#x27;s sphere of influence and, in June 1940, the Soviets issued an ultimatum demanding the transfer of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. King Carol II of Romania acquiesced and the area was annexed. Central and northern Bessarabia formed the center of the new Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic but part of the south, now known as Budjak, was apportioned to the Ukrainian SSR. The commission that decided the administrative border between the Ukrainian SSR and Moldavian SSR inside the Soviet Union was chaired by Nikita Khrushchev, the then leader of the Ukrainian SSR and the future USSR leader who would add Crimea to the Ukrainian SSR.

On 7 August 1940 the Soviets formed Akkerman Oblast, which was administratively subdivided into 13 raions. The city of Akkerman (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi) was the center of the oblast. Four months later, on 7 December 1940 the oblast was renamed Izmail Oblast, and the oblast center was moved to the city of Izmail.

Upon Nazi Germany&#x27;s June 1941 declaration of war on the Soviet Union, Romania sided with the Axis Powers and retook the territories previously annexed by the Soviet Union, including Budjak, but then also continued the war into proper Soviet territory. The area was regained by the Soviets in 1944 and, despite a royal coup by Michael I of Romania that led to Romania joining the Allies in August 1944, was annexed by the Soviets in the 1940 political configuration.

During the administrative reform of Ukrainian SSR, on 15 February 1954, Izmail Oblast was liquidated, and all raions of the oblast were included into Odesa Oblast. By territory, Odesa oblast is now the largest oblast in Ukraine.

With the fall of the Soviet Union, each of the fifteen republics that formally had the right to secede became independent, with boundaries preserved as were inside Soviet Union, since the same Soviet Constitution stipulated that they could not be changed without the mutual consent of both republics, and no discussions between the two upon such an issue were ever held.

Budjak is now a part of independent Ukraine, linked to the rest of Odesa oblast by two bridges across the Dniester River. The northernmost connection enters Moldovan territory for a 7.63 km (4 miles) stretch of road, which is controlled by Ukraine as per an agreement between the two countries.

Petro Poroshenko, the former President of Ukraine, was born in the Budjak town of Bolhrad in 1965.

In the autumn of 2014 there were reports of plots to proclaim a pro-Russian People&#x27;s Republic in the Budjak region of Bessarabia, along the lines of the separatist &quot;people&#x27;s republics&quot; established in the Donbas region. However, the growing intensity of the war in the Donbas cooled the enthusiasm for separatism and any plans that may have existed failed to materialise. By the end of the year there were reports of drones over the Budjak, apparently from Russian-backed militants in Transnistria or the Black Sea.

== Subdivisions ==
In the Ukrainian SSR and Ukraine, until July 2020, the historical territory of Budjak was subdivided into two cities and nine administrative districts (&quot;raions&quot;) of Ukraine&#x27;s Odesa Oblast:

After July 2020, the area is split between Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Bolhrad, and Izmail raions.

==Ethnic groups and demographics==
The main ethnic groups in Budjak today are Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Russians, Romanians and Moldovans (there is an ongoing controversy, in part involving linguistic definitions of ethnicity, over whether Moldovans&#x27; self-identification constitutes an ethnic group distinct and apart from Romanians, or a subset of a broader Romanian identity). The region was inhabited by Romanians and Nogai Tatars through the Middle Ages, but became a home to several other ethnicities and religious groups in the 19th century when it was part of the Russian Empire. The examples are Bessarabian Bulgarians, Bessarabian Germans, Gagauzians and Lipovan Russians who settled in compact areas.

Muslim, Turkic-speaking Nogai Tatars inhabited Ottoman-dominated Budjak until the start of the 19th century, but were forced to abandon the region once the Russian Empire got control over the territory. They resettled in the Caucasus, Dobruja (both in the Romanian and Bulgarian parts) or in modern Turkey.
Budjak was also home to a number of ethnic Germans known as Bessarabian Germans, originally from Württemberg and Prussia, who settled the region in the early 19th century, after it became part of the Russian Empire. A large number of them cultivated the Budjak steppes, known also as &quot;Kronsland&quot; (see also map). They were deported in the Nazi-Soviet population transfers following the Soviet takeover of Bessarabia in 1940. These &quot;Germans from outside Germany&quot;, or &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, were mostly resettled in areas of Nazi occupied Poland, and had to move again at the end of World War II (one example was the family of the former president of Germany Horst Köhler).

Like Moldova, Budjak is home to a small minority of Gagauzes: an Orthodox Christian Turkic people who arrived from the eastern Balkans in the early 19th century, and settled part of the area vacated by the Nogais.

The Bulgarians of the region are known as Bessarabian Bulgarians, and, like the Gagauzes, are descendants of settlers from the eastern Balkans (today eastern Bulgaria) who moved to the area vacated by the Nogais, in order to escape Muslim domination.

During the same period, Lipovan Russians settled in the area close to the mouth of the Danube river.

Until World War II, the region was also home to a significant number of Jews, a portion of whom were killed in the Holocaust along with other Bessarabian Jews. Still, Jews remained a sizeable minority in several towns, first of all in Bilhorod-Dnistrovs&#x27;kyi until mass emigration to Israel in the 1980s and 1990s. Budjak was the only region within the former Russian Empire where a significant number of Sephardic Ladino-speaking Jews could be found as late as the second half of the 19th century. These Sephardim later assimilated with the majority of local Ashkenazic Jewry, but many retained surnames of either Turkic origin or otherwise suggestive of Sephardic descent.

According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, Budjak has a population of 617,200 people, distributed among the ethnic groups as follows: Ukrainians 248,000 (40%), Bulgarians 129,000 (21%), Russians 124,500 (20%), Moldovans 78,300 (13%) and Gagauzians 24,700 (4%). (See also the table below.) Note, that the total population of the Odesa Oblast is, by the 2001 Ukrainian Census, 2,469,000.

Although the majority of Russians and Moldovans declared the language of their ethnicity as their mother tongue, only roughly half of Ukrainians did so, while the other half indicated Russian as their native language. The Bulgarians also tend to use Russian more than Bulgarian, especially in public. The above numbers reflect the declared ethnicity, not the native language. The most common spoken language in everyday public use in Budjak is Russian.

Bulgarians are the largest ethnic group in the Artsyz (39%), Bolhrad (61%), and Tarutyne (38%) raions (districts, pre-2020), Moldovans – in the Reni Raion (50%), Russians – in the city of Izmail (44%), and Ukrainians – in the Kiliia (45%), Tatarbunary (71%), Sarata (44%), and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi (82%) raions, and in the city of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi (63%).

In the Izmail Raion, 29% of the population is Ukrainian, 28% Moldovan, and 26% Bulgarian. Since the previous census in 1989, its Moldovan population increased by 1% relative to the number of Ukrainian and Bulgarians, although the actual number of Moldovans has decreased in absolute terms, yet at a slower rate than that of Ukrainians, Russians and Bulgarians, probably due to the fact that a portion of the non-Moldovan population of the area were relatively recent arrivals from other regions of the former Soviet Union, and chose to return upon its dissolution.
:1 All numbers are averaged to hundreds for each raion and city. The entries of the row &quot;total&quot; contain the sums of the respective entries for each line, hence bears a theoretical margin error of plus/minus 550. Numbers provided by other sources differ, but fit within this margin of error.
:2 The &quot;Others&quot; category includes people who declared themselves as Romanians. For the entire Odesa Oblast (which includes the raions that comprise historic Budjak) 724 people declared themselves as Romanians. For a discussion about Moldovan/Romanian identity controversy, see Moldovenism. In the Republic of Moldova, “more than half of the self-proclaimed Moldovans (53.5%) said that they saw no difference” between the Romanian and Moldovan languages according to a survey conducted by Pal Kolsto and Hans Olav Melberg in 1998.
:3 Certain settlements are called &quot;cities&quot; (7 here). Some of them are called &quot;regional cities&quot; (2 here), and have administrations that are financed and receive directions from the oblast administration. Others are called &quot;raion cities&quot; (5 here), and are component parts of raions. Raions have administrations just like regional cities, only that they consist of mainly rural areas.Some settlements (9 here) used to have an intermediate status, between that of a village and that of a city. They were designated as urban-type settlements, but were abolished in 2024 and became rural settlements.

Local and regional authorities do not collect taxes. They are considered state institutions of the country at the local level, not institutions of local self-administration.

<text>Singles is the soundtrack album of the 1992 film &quot;Singles&quot;, released on June 30, 1992, almost three months before the film. It is primarily focused on the ascendant Seattle grunge scene of the early 1990s, but also features contributions from past Seattle artists Jimi Hendrix and The Lovemongers (Heart&#x27;s Ann and Nancy Wilson, the latter of whom was the wife of the film&#x27;s director Cameron Crowe at the time), Chicago&#x27;s The Smashing Pumpkins, and the first solo material from Minneapolis&#x27; Paul Westerberg after the breakup of The Replacements.

The album peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200 on the week of October 10, 1992 and has been certified two times platinum by the RIAA, indicating sales of at least two million copies in the United States. In April 2019, it was ranked No. 19 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; list.

A Deluxe Edition of the album featuring a bonus disc with 18 additional tracks was released on May 19, 2017, one day after the death of Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, whose music is featured prominently on the soundtrack and who has a cameo in the film; this was only a coincidence, as the album&#x27;s release date had been announced in January. Songs used in the movie, but not included on either edition of the soundtrack, are: &quot;Three Days&quot; by Jane&#x27;s Addiction, &quot;Little Girl&quot; by Muddy Waters, &quot;Dig for Fire&quot; by the Pixies, &quot;Radio Song&quot; by R.E.M., &quot;Blue Train&quot; by John Coltrane, &quot;Family Affair&quot; by Sly &amp; The Family Stone, &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; by The Cult, and &quot;Jinx&quot; by Tad.

==Impact==
The soundtrack is considered to have helped open the door to the explosive popularity of Seattle grunge in the early 1990s. According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, &quot;&quot;Singles&quot; helped crystallize the idea of the &#x27;Seattle scene&#x27; in the mainstream public&#x27;s mind, and it was also one of the first big-selling &#x27;90s movie soundtracks (it went platinum and reached the Top Ten) to feature largely new work from contemporary artists ... it&#x27;s a milestone in the breakthrough of alternative rock into mainstream popular culture, neatly and effectively packaging the Seattle phenomenon for the wider national consciousness.&quot;

==Deluxe Edition==
On May 19, 2017, a remastered Deluxe Edition of the album was released to commemorate the original album&#x27;s 25th anniversary. In addition to the original 13-song soundtrack on either one CD or two LPs, this release included new liner notes and track-by-track descriptions by Cameron Crowe and a bonus CD consisting of 18 additional tracks. The bonus material included a track each from Truly and Blood Circus, live tracks by Alice in Chains and Soundgarden that were recorded during their performances in the film, and demos and instrumentals by Mudhoney, Paul Westerberg, Chris Cornell, and members of Pearl Jam. Of these tracks, seven were previously-unreleased, and five had never been released on CD. Also included is &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Dick&quot; by Matt Dillon’s fictional band in the film, Citizen Dick, which was recorded by Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder, Stone Gossard, and Jeff Ament.

==Track listing==
* In addition to later recording &quot;Spoon Man&quot; with Soundgarden (as &quot;Spoonman&quot;) and &quot;Flutter Girl&quot; on his debut solo album, Chris Cornell reused the lyrics of the first two verses and bridge of &quot;Ferry Boat #3&quot; in the song &quot;The Curse&quot; on Audioslave&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Out of Exile&quot;.

<doc id="1138668" wikidata="Q5313181" url="?curid=1138668" title="Duke's Dock">
<text>Duke&#x27;s Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is in the southern dock system, connected to Salthouse Dock and Wapping Dock to the east. The Albert Dock is located immediately north, although not directly accessible by water. 

==History==
The land for the dock was obtained in 1768. Opening in 1773, Duke&#x27;s Dock was built privately for the Duke of Bridgewater as a Liverpool-based facility for traffic using the Bridgewater Canal from Manchester. The dock was probably designed by James Brindley, who also built the Bridgewater Canal. The first dockside warehouse on the Mersey was built at the dock in 1783, and the dock was extended in the 1790s due to growth in the cotton industry. In 1811, a large six-storey warehouse was built on the southern side of the dock. Barges were able to enter the warehouse from the dock, and the building lasted until the 1960s. In 1845, a small half-tide dock was constructed between Duke&#x27;s Dock and the river and, at the opposite end of the dock, Wapping Basin was added in 1855. The dock was purchased by the MD&amp;HB in 1900, and the warehouses remained until 1960. The dock had a southern branch which was filled in 1967, and warehouses were removed from the north and south quaysides. The dock closed in 1972.

===After closure===
After the closure of Duke&#x27;s Dock, the dock silted up during the following decade and the quayside was in a state of considerable dereliction by 1980. In 1980, disused buildings including one of the Liverpool Lighterage Company, a training school and a customs house still remained on the north quayside. 
In 1981, the Merseyside Development Corporation was established to rejuvenate the South Docks, and the dock was dredged between 1981-5. The river entrance was filled in during the 1980s, and replaced with a permanent roadway leading to a large temporary car park on the site of King&#x27;s Dock. Footbridges across the dock, leading from the King&#x27;s Dock car park to the rejuvenated Albert Dock, were also installed at this time. The remaining buildings on the north quayside were also removed, to create permanent car parking space for the Albert Dock.

==Present use==
Direct river access to the west is no longer provided, with the only remains of the river entrance being markings on the dock wall. The dock is still accessible from Wapping Basin.

The water depth varies from around up to . The dock is sometimes used by sport scuba divers. Its water is clear and it has much underwater sealife. The waterspace, of this and the other docks in the southern system, was owned by British Waterways from 2003 to 2012 and now transferred to the Canal &amp; River Trust. Water balling is now allowed on the dock.

<text>Manchester Dock was a dock on the River Mersey in England and a part of the Port of Liverpool. The dock was not part of the interconnected dock system, but was connected directly to the river.

==History==
In the 1780s, the docks at Liverpool were expanding, and the Manchester Basin was built to the north of the Canning Dock. It was a tidal basin which was linked directly to the river, and was not linked directly to the other docks. The benefits of turning it into a proper dock were soon realised, and an entrance lock was constructed between 1810 and 1815, by John Foster, Sr., after which it was known as the Manchester Dock. The dock was an important gateway for the export of coal and manufactured goods, and for the import of corn and cotton. With the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1845, the dock was used to hold their barges, and later those of the Great Western Railway, who transferred goods between the dock and their rail terminal at Morpeth Dock in Birkenhead.

The Liverpool Docks were controlled by the Docks Committee between 1825 and 1857. During this period, the total area of the docks was increased from 82 to , and the length of the quays was by 1857. Most of the increase was achieved by the construction of new docks, but they also purchased the Manchester Dock in 1851. Control of the docks passed to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in 1858.

By the 1920s, the dock traffic waned. Manchester Dock and the adjacent Chester Basin were dangerously subsiding because of excavation works for the Queensway Tunnel which ran underneath the site. Both docks were filled in by 1936, using rubble obtained from the construction of the tunnel. The area later became a car park, sealing the remains under a protective layer of tarmac.

==Excavation==

In 2006/7, the dock was excavated as part of a major construction project for the new Museum of Liverpool and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal link to the Canning and Albert Docks. These excavations also exposed the neighbouring Chester Basin, and have provided important archaeological information as the entrance lock is one of the oldest in the whole Liverpool Docks complex. Most other locks of a similar age have either been destroyed or extensively modified.

<doc id="1138675" wikidata="Q162277" url="?curid=1138675" title="Alexander (2004 film)">
<text>Alexander is a 2004 epic historical drama film based on the life of the ancient Macedonian general and king Alexander the Great. It was co-written and directed by Oliver Stone and starred Colin Farrell. The film&#x27;s original screenplay was derived in part from the book &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, published in 1973 by the University of Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox. After release, while it performed well in Europe, the American critical reaction was negative. It grossed $167 million worldwide against a $155 million budget, thus making it a commercial failure.

Four versions of the film exist, the initial theatrical cut and three home video director&#x27;s cuts: the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; in 2005, the &quot;Final Cut&quot; in 2007, and the &quot;Ultimate Cut&quot; in 2014. The two earlier DVD versions of &quot;Alexander&quot; (&quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; version and the theatrical version) sold over 3.5 million copies in the United States. Oliver Stone&#x27;s third version, &quot;Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut&quot; (2007), sold nearly a million copies and became one of the highest-selling catalog items from Warner Bros ().

==Plot==
Around 285 BC, Ptolemy I Soter, &quot;basileus&quot; and pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt, narrates the life of Alexander. Alexander grows up with his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, where he finds interest in love, honor, music, exploration, poetry and military combat. His relationship with his father, Philip II of Macedon, is destroyed when Philip marries Attalus&#x27;s niece, Eurydice. Alexander insults Philip after disowning Attalus as his kinsman, which results in Alexander&#x27;s banishment from Philip&#x27;s palace.

After Philip is assassinated, Alexander becomes King of Macedonia. Ptolemy mentions Alexander&#x27;s punitive campaign in which he razes Thebes, also referring to the later burning of Persepolis, then gives an overview of Alexander&#x27;s west-Persian campaign, including his declaration as the son of Zeus by the Oracle of Amun at Siwa Oasis, his great battle against the Persian Emperor Darius III in the Battle of Gaugamela, and his eight-year campaign across Asia.

Alexander&#x27;s most private relationships are these with his childhood friend Hephaestion, Bagoas, and later his wife, Roxana. Hephaestion compares Alexander to Achilles, to which Alexander replies that Hephaestion must be his Patroclus (Achilles&#x27;s lover). When Hephaestion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaestion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife (as Achilles had done for Patroclus). Hephaestion shows extensive jealousy when Alexander marries Roxana, going so far as to attempt to keep her away from him after Alexander murders Cleitus the Black in India during a drunken rage.

After initial objection from his soldiers, Alexander convinces them to join him in his final and bloodiest battle, the Battle of Hydaspes. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Later on, Hephaestion succumbs to typhus carried with him from India, and dies, deeply saddening Alexander. During a symposium in Babylon, Alexander falls unconscious after downing a large bowl of wine. On his deathbed, Bagoas grieves as Alexander&#x27;s generals begin to split up his kingdom and fight over the ownership of his body.

In 285 BC, Ptolemy admits to his scribe that he, along with all the other officers, had indeed poisoned Alexander just to spare themselves from any future conquests or consequences. However, he has it recorded that Alexander died due to illness compounding his overall weakened condition. He then goes on to end his memoirs with praise to Alexander.

Ptolemy&#x27;s memoirs of Alexander were eventually burned, lost forever with other scrolls of the Library of Alexandria by the end of the Roman Empire.

==Cast==
==Controversies==
A group of 25 Greek lawyers initially threatened to file a lawsuit against both Stone and the Warner Bros film studio for what they claimed was an inaccurate portrayal of history. &quot;We are not saying that we are against gays,&quot; said Yannis Varnakos, &quot;but we are saying that the production company should make it clear to the audience that this film is pure fiction and not a true depiction of the life of Alexander&quot;. After an advance screening of the film, the lawyers announced that they would not pursue such a course of action.

At the British premiere of the film, Stone blamed &quot;raging fundamentalism in morality&quot; for the film&#x27;s failure at the US box office. He argued that American critics and audiences had blown the issue of Alexander&#x27;s sexuality out of proportion. The criticism prompted him to make significant changes to the film for its DVD release, whose cover characterizes them as making it &quot;faster paced, more action-packed&quot;.

==Historical accuracy==
In the making of &quot;Alexander&quot;, Oliver Stone had consulted the Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox, as well as his colleagues and other British experts. Stone also consulted CUNY Queens College historian John Maxwell O&#x27;Brien (in part from his book &quot;Alexander the Great: The Invisible Enemy: A Biography&quot;) though he remains uncredited in the film.

The movie has attracted both praise as well as criticism from numerous ancient historians. The general opinion has been that while the movie shows remarkable historical accuracy in several aspects, it is above all a dramatization and includes both stylistic changes as well as some inaccuracies, particularly regarding the depiction of Persians and eastern peoples in general.

===Historical praise===

Particularly praiseworthy has been its depiction of the battle of Gaugamela. Eugene N. Borza, a professor emeritus focusing on Ancient Macedon has said: &quot;The re-enactment of the enormously complex battle of Gaugamela is impressive, not only reproducing several of the main events of the conflict, but indicating how difficult it was for large armies to operate on a desert plain made opaque by dust and chaotic by the clash of arms,&quot; and praised its depiction of the Macedonian phalanx. Roel Konijnendijk, a Dutch historian of Ancient Greek warfare, called it, despite some of the minor inaccuracies, &quot;in terms of ancient warfare [...] the most accurate depiction that you will find anywhere.&quot;

Eugene N. Borza had also praised the detailed setpieces depicting the Achaemenid Babylon as &quot;spectacular,&quot; such as the interior and exterior designs and noting how the trinkets and jewelry were based on actual recent archaeological findings.

The early-Greek-history ethnographer/analyst Angelos Chaniotis, of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton — in summarizing the first three versions of the film as &quot;a dramatisation, [rather than] a documentary&quot; — insists that, despite its imperfections, historians and history students &quot;have a lot to learn&quot; by &quot;studying and reflecting upon&quot; Stone&#x27;s film. He concludes that, as a motion picture that &quot;captures the Zeitgeist&quot; (spirit of the times) of the &quot;ancient Greek&quot; era, &quot;no film... can rival Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Alexander.&quot;&quot;
===Historical criticism===
According to Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, Professor of Ancient History at Cardiff University: &quot;Oliver Stone&#x27;s movie &quot;Alexander&quot; (2004) displays all the familiar Orientalist notions about the inferiority and picturesqueness of Eastern societies. So much so, indeed, that in terms of its portrayal of East–West relationships, &quot;Alexander&quot; has to be seen as a stale cultural statement and a worn-out reflection of the continuing Western preoccupation with an imaginary exotic Orient.&quot;

Persian history expert Kaveh Farrokh questioned the omission of the burning of Persepolis by Alexander and observed that, in the film, &quot;Greek forces are typically shown as very organised, disciplined, and so on, and what&#x27;s very disturbing is, when the so-called Persians are shown confronting the Macedonians, you see them turbaned. Turbans are not even a Persian item [...] Their armies are totally disorganized. What is not known is that the Persians actually had uniforms. They marched in discipline [sic], and music was actually used...&quot;

===Stone&#x27;s response to criticism===
Stone has, in his various commentaries in the film&#x27;s DVD, defended the most glaring historical issues in regard to Persian and Indian history, by saying he had no resources to portray accurately a multitude of battles at the expense of storytelling. He described in detail explaining how he merged all the major aspects of the Battle of the Granicus and Battle of Issus into the Battle of Gaugamela, as well as heavily simplifying the Battle of the Hydaspes into a straightforward clash, while merging the near-death of Alexander with the siege of Malli. In a taped discussion at the Oxford Union, Stone stated about his presentation of the Battle of Gaugamela: &quot;I&#x27;ve been told by many historians that the battle is as accurate as they&#x27;ve ever seen in any movie, ever, to what they think happened at the battle&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Alexander&quot; was released in 2,445 venues on 24 November 2004 and earned $13.7 million in its opening weekend, ranking sixth in the North American box office and second among the week&#x27;s new releases. Upon closing on 1 February 2005, the film grossed $34.3 million domestically and $133 million overseas for a worldwide total of $167.3 million. Based on a $155 million production budget, as well as additional marketing costs, the film was a box-office bomb, with projected losses of as much as $71 million.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 206 reviews, with an average rating of 4.00/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Even at nearly three hours long, this ponderous, talky, and emotionally distant biopic fails to illuminate Alexander&#x27;s life.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

One of the principal complaints among American film critics was that &quot;Alexander&quot; resembled less an action-drama film than a history documentary. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, giving the film two out of four stars, wrote in his review, &quot;[W]e welcome the scenes of battle, pomp and circumstance because at least for a time we are free of the endless narration of Ptolemy the historian.&quot;

Faint praise came from Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; who wrote, &quot;Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&quot; is at best an honorable failure, an intelligent and ambitious picture that crucially lacks dramatic flair and emotional involvement. Dry and academic where &quot;Troy&quot; (2004) was vulgar and willfully ahistorical&quot;.

Keith Uhlich of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; named &quot;Alexander: The Ultimate Cut&quot; the tenth-best film of 2014.

===Nominations===
The film was nominated in six categories at the Golden Raspberry Awards in 2005: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Colin Farrell), Worst Actress (Angelina Jolie) and Worst Director (Oliver Stone), Worst Supporting Actor (Val Kilmer) and Worst Screenplay, thereby becoming the second-most-nominated potential &quot;Razzie&quot; film of 2004; however, it won no awards.

At the 2004 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, it received nine nominations: Worst Picture, Worst Director (Stone), Worst Actor (Farrell), Worst Supporting Actress (both Jolie and Dawson), Worst Screenplay, Most Intrusive Musical Score, Worst Female Fake Accent (Dawson and Jolie, lumped into one nomination), and Least &quot;Special&quot; Special Effects. Its only wins were for Most Intrusive Musical Score and Worst Female Fake Accent.

==Versions==
Several versions of the film have been released, and these have generally been seen as improvements on the initial release version. Critic Peter Sobczynski said &quot;The various expansions and rejiggerings have improved it immeasurably, and what was once a head-scratching mess has reformed into an undeniably fascinating example of epic cinema.&quot;

===Theatrical cut (2004)===
This is the film as it was originally released in theaters, with a running time of 175 minutes. It was released on DVD and is also available on Blu-ray in some territories.

===Director&#x27;s cut (2005)===
Stone&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut was re-edited before the DVD release later in 2005. Stone removed seventeen minutes of footage and added nine. This shortened the running time from 175 minutes to 167.

===&quot;Alexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut&quot; (2007)===
Stone also made an extended version of &quot;Alexander&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m doing a third version on DVD, not theatrical&quot;, he said, in an interview with Rope of Silicon. &quot;I&#x27;m going to do a Cecil B. DeMille three-hour-45-minute thing; I&#x27;m going to go all out, put everything I like in the movie. He [Alexander] was a complicated man, it was a complicated story, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to make it longer and let people who loved the film [...] see it more and understand it more.&quot;

The extended version was released under the title of &quot;Alexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut&quot; on 27 February 2007. The two-disc set featured a new introduction by Stone. &quot;Over the last two years,&quot; he said, &quot;I have been able to sort out some of the unanswered questions about this highly complicated and passionate monarch – questions I failed to answer dramatically enough. This film represents my complete and last version, as it will contain all the essential footage we shot. I don&#x27;t know how many film-makers have managed to make three versions of the same film, but I have been fortunate to have the opportunity because of the success of video and DVD sales in the world, and I felt, if I didn&#x27;t do it now, with the energy and memory I still have for the subject, it would never quite be the same again. For me, this is the complete &quot;Alexander&quot;, the clearest interpretation I can offer.&quot;

The film is restructured into two acts with an intermission. &quot;Alexander: Revisited&quot; takes a more in-depth look at Alexander&#x27;s life and his relationships with Olympias, Philip, Hephaestion, Roxana, and Ptolemy. The film has a running time of three hours and 34 minutes (214 minutes, about 40 minutes longer than the theatrical cut and almost 50 minutes longer than the first director&#x27;s cut) and is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen with English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio. Beyond the new introduction with Stone, there are no other extras on the DVD except for a free coupon to the movie &quot;300&quot;. The Blu-ray and HD-DVD releases both feature a variety of special features however, including two audio commentaries and a new featurette.

For seven years, it was the only version of the film available on Blu-ray, until the release of the Ultimate Cut, which also includes the Theatrical Cut.

===&quot;Alexander: The Ultimate Cut&quot; (2014)===
In November 2012, Stone revealed that he was working on a fourth cut of the film at Warner&#x27;s request, and that this time around he would remove material, as he felt he had added in too much in the &quot;Final Cut&quot;. The version, which is 206 minutes long, premiered on 3 July 2013 at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and Stone swears that no more versions will follow. &#x27;Alexander: The Ultimate Cut (Tenth Anniversary Edition)&#x27; was released in the United States on 3 June 2014.

<doc id="1138676" wikidata="Q1572622" url="?curid=1138676" title="Waorani people">
<text>The Waorani, Waodani, or Huaorani, also known as the Waos, are an Indigenous people from the Amazonian Region of Ecuador (Napo, Orellana, and Pastaza Provinces) who have marked differences from other ethnic groups from Ecuador. The alternate name Auca is a pejorative exonym used by the neighboring Quechua natives, and commonly adopted by Spanish-speakers as well. (&quot;&quot; in Quechua) means &#x27;savage&#x27;.

They comprise almost 4,000 inhabitants and speak the Waorani language, also known as &quot;Huoarani&quot;, &quot;Wao&quot;, &quot;Sapela&quot; and &quot;Auca&quot;, a linguistic isolate that is not known to be related to any other language.

Their ancestral lands are located between the Curaray and Napo rivers, about 50 miles (80 km) south of El Coca. These homelands—approximately 120 miles (190 km) wide and 75 to 100 miles (120 to 160 km) from north to south—are threatened by oil exploration and illegal logging practices. In the past, Huaorani were able to protect their culture and lands from both indigenous enemies and settlers by force of arms.

In the last 40 years, they have shifted from a hunting and gathering society to living mostly in permanent forest settlements. As many as five communities—the Tagaeri, the Huiñatare, the Oñamenane, and two groups of the Taromenane—have rejected all contact with the outside world and continue to move into more isolated areas.

== Etymology ==

The word &#x27; (plural of &#x27; &#x27;person&#x27;) means &#x27;humans&#x27; or &#x27;men&#x27; in &#x27;. Before the mid 20th century, it included only those kin associated with the speaker. Others in the ethnic group were called &quot;Waodoni&quot;, while outsiders were and are known by the derogatory term &#x27;. This structure duplicates the in-group/out-group naming conventions used by many peoples. It reflects a period of traumatic conflict with outsiders during the 19th and early 20th century rubber boom / oil exploration.

The name &#x27; (or the alternative English spelling &quot;Waodani&quot;) represents a transliteration by English-speaking missionary linguists. The phonetic equivalent used by Spanish-speakers is &#x27; (reflecting the absence of &quot;w&quot; in Spanish spelling). The sounds represented by the English and Spanish letters &quot;d&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are allophones in the Waorani language (also known as Sabela, Wao Terero, and pejoratively known as &quot;Auca&quot;).

== Tribal subgroups ==
The Waorani are subdivided into the Toñampare, Quenahueno, Tihueno, Quihuaro, Damuintaro, Zapino, Tigüino, Huamuno, Dayuno, Quehueruno, Garzacocha (río Yasuní), Quemperi (río Cononaco) Mima, Caruhue (río Cononaco) and Tagaeri.

== First encounter, as told by Scott Wallace ==

According to journalist Scott Wallace, American missionaries, led by Jim Elliot, attempted to contact the Waorani in the 1950s with airdropped gifts and visual messages. After establishing a visual relationship, they attempted to land a small airplane on a beach nearby and contact the tribe in person. Six Waorani tribesmen killed them with spears.

== Culture ==

=== Worldview ===
In traditional animist Waorani worldview, there is no distinction between the physical and spiritual worlds, and spirits are present throughout the world. The Waorani once believed that the entire world was a forest (and used the same word, &quot;&quot;, for both). The Oriente&#x27;s rainforest remains the essential basis of their physical and cultural survival. For them, the forest is home, while the outside world is considered unsafe.

In short, as one Waorani put it, &quot;The rivers and trees are our life.&quot; In all its specificities, the forest is woven into each Waorani life and conceptions of the world. They have remarkably detailed knowledge of its geography and ecology. The Huaorani evolved to have very flat feet, which help them climb trees.

Hunting supplies a major part of the Waorani diet and is of cultural significance. Before a hunting or fishing party ensues, the community shaman will often pray for a day to ensure its success. Traditionally, the creatures hunted were monkeys, birds, and wild peccaries, as there was an extensive collection of hunting and eating taboos, for example prohibiting the consumption of deer, on the grounds that deer eyes look similar to human eyes. Neither land-based predators nor birds of prey are hunted. While a joyful activity, hunting has ethical ramifications: &quot;The Guarani [Waorani] must kill animals to live, but they believed dead animal spirits live on and must be placated or else do harm in angry retribution.&quot; To counterbalance the offense of hunting, a shaman demonstrated respect through the ritual preparation of the poison, &quot;curare&quot;, used in blow darts. Hunting with such darts is not considered killing, but retrieving, essentially a kind of harvesting from the trees.
Plants, especially trees, continue to hold an important interest for the Waorani. Their store of botanical knowledge is extensive, ranging from knowledge of materials to poisons to hallucinogens to medicines. They also relate plants to their own experiences, particularly that of growing. Certain kinds of tree are considered auspicious by the Waorani. Canopy trees, with their distinctly colored young leaves and striking transformation as they mature to towering giants, are &quot;admired for their solitary character... as well as for their profuse entanglement&quot; with other plants. Other significant trees are the pioneer species of the peach palm (used for making spears and blowguns, as well as for fruit), and fast-growing balsa wood, used for ceremonial purposes. Peach palm trees are associated with past settlements and the ancestors who live there.

Shamanic ethnomedicine uses the ayahuasca beverage and a newly identified mushroom (&quot;Dictyonema huaorani&quot;) with the analogous substance of Psilocybe genus.

As with many peoples, the Waorani maintain a strong in-group/out-group distinction, between &#x27; (people who are kin), &#x27; (others in their culture who are unrelated) and &quot;. The use of Waorani as a term for their entire culture emerged in the last fifty years in a process of ethnogenesis. This was accelerated by the creation of ONHAE, a radio service, and a soccer league.

The Waorani notion of time is particularly oriented to the present, with few obligations extending backwards or forwards in time. Their one word for future times, &quot;, also means &#x27;tomorrow&#x27;.

=== Weapons ===
The main hunting weapon is the blowgun. These weapons are typically from 3 to 4 meters long. The arrows used are dipped in curare poison, which paralyzes the muscles of the animal with which it is hit, so that it cannot breathe. Kapok fluff is used to create an air-tight seal, by twisting the fibers around the end of the dart or arrow. With the introduction of Western technology in the 20th century, many Waorani now use rifles for hunting.

== Land rights ==
In 1990, the Waorani won the rights to the Waorani Ethnic Reserve, constituting . The protected status of Yasuní National Park, which overlaps with the Waorani reserve, provides some measure of environmental protection. In August 2023, Ecuadorians approved a referendum to stop oil drilling in the Park.

<text>The Ohio Military Reserve (OHMR) is one of three separate components that make up the Ohio State Defense Force (SDF). Like other SDF&#x27;s the Ohio Military Reserve functions as a reserve to the Ohio National Guard.

State Defense Forces are not eligible for federal funding and must request their assets from the state. However, like most other SDFs, the Ohio Military Reserve is almost entirely self-funded. Personnel are unpaid for their training and must provide their own uniforms and equipment.

The OHMR serves under the Adjutant General and is headquartered at the in Columbus, Ohio.

As of 2023, the OHMR operates as a brigade level entity. It&#x27;s sole brigade is the 4th Civil Sustainment and Support Brigade.

The OHMR has a &quot;sister service&quot;, the Ohio Naval Militia which operates out of Camp Perry, located near Port Clinton, Ohio.

==History==
===20th century===
During World War I, 120 companies of Home Guard were organized across the cities and towns of Ohio to replace the Ohio National Guard, which was sent overseas. Organized at a local level, members were classified as policemen or deputy sheriffs by local authorities. In 1918, the Governor of Ohio recognized the units officially, reclassifying them as the Ohio Home Guard under authority of the governor, so that they could receive rifles and other equipment from the federal government.

The Ohio Home Guard was reactivated during World War II under the name &quot;Ohio State Guard.&quot; The Ohio State Guard reached a strength of over 4,000 by June 1944. Among other responsibilities, the Ohio State Guard staffed a mobile gas warfare demonstration school which instructed more than 25,000 civil defense workers in addition to its own units.

Ohio maintained its state defense through the Cold War as well. The Ohio Defense Corps was established in May 1949; a minimum cadre for five regiments was recruited within a month.

===Reorganization===

In 2009, the OHMR underwent a reorganization which changed its mission to emergency management. The OHMR began a transformation process that took it from its former mission as a cadre state defense force held in reserve to its current mission as an active force. The current mission focuses on FEMA Emergency Support Functions (ESF) 6 and 7. This includes aiding in operating mass care facilities (ESF 6) and warehouses, distribution centers, and support facilities (ESF 7).

The transformation took part in three phases. The first phase was integration, which ended in September 2010. In the second phase, the OHMR became initially operational capable during the Fiscal Year 2011, and the third resulted in the OHMR becoming fully operational capable in Fiscal Year 2012.

===Modern era===
On 25 October 2019, Governor Mike DeWine signed into law a bill which created a volunteer Ohio Cyber Reserve (OhCR) made up of trained civilians and organized as a part of the Ohio Military Reserve. The stated purpose of the unit is to be available for the governor to assist eligible municipalities with cybersecurity vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to reduce cyber threats. The first teams are expected to be created by the end of January 2020.

Beginning in March 2020, members of the Ohio Military Reserve were activated as a part of Operation Steady Resolve, as part of Ohio&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial mission was to assist twelve food banks across Ohio with packaging, transporting and distributing food and other essential items to vulnerable populations across Ohio. In Columbus, the National Guard and Military Reserve packed boxes and served meals to men staying at the Downtown YMCA, including those who have been relocated from homeless shelters.

==Personnel and training==
Enlistment is voluntary, however all soldiers swear an oath of enlistment or appointment. Officers hold state, not federal, commissions. Units are co-located in state-owned readiness centers (armories) with National Guard units across the state. Most units drill one weekend a month and all troops must attend one week of training annually (annual training, or AT). In the past, troops trained with pistols and shotguns, however, the cost of maintenance and annual re-certification has caused this training to be dropped. Although they are covered by the State&#x27;s insurance and workers’ compensation program, soldiers are not paid for their training time or AT period. However, if mobilized, they would be compensated. §5903.02 of the Ohio Revised Code provides OHMR personnel protection under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act (USERRA) which addresses military leave from employment for both training and deployment.

In 2010, as part of its shift to an emergency management mission, the OHMR sponsored training on National Incident Management System (NIMS) compliance and Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) for all soldiers in the OHMR.

The OHMR maintains a military training academy to conduct state versions of standard Army professional development courses such as Basic Entry Level Training (required for all non-prior service personnel), Primary Leadership Development Course, Basic Non-commissioned Officer Course, and the Basic Officer Course. In addition, the OHMR Academy offers a series of Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD) correspondence courses.

OHMR members can earn the Military Emergency Management Specialist Badge from the State Guard Association of the United States, The badge includes Basic, Senior and Master level qualifications.

==Uniform==

The current uniform of OHMR is the OCP (Operational Camouflage Pattern) with tan name tags, the Ohio flag patch on the right arm and OHMR unit patch on the left arm. The members of OHMR are authorized to wear the Army Service Uniform (ASU), with the exception of a red, rather than black, nameplate, OHMR or Ohio buttons, and SDF specific insignia. The OHMR wears the service cap (with modified insignia) with the ASU as well as the black beret with the red &quot;State Defense Force&quot; Beret Flash worn by some other states.

==Legal protection==
Under Ohio law, members of the Ohio Military Reserve are guaranteed the same employment rights and protections as federal reservists enjoy under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Among other legal rights guaranteed under this provision, OHMR members are protected from discrimination based on their membership in the OHMR both during the hiring process and after becoming employed; they are also guaranteed a leave of absence from their places of employment whenever they are activated for training or to take part in an emergency, and their employers are required to reinstate these employees to their previous positions when they return from deployment.

Members of the OHMR, being a part of the Ohio Organized Militia are treated as law enforcement officers and are immune from arrest during state active duty deployment except in case of treason or felony when aiding the civil authorities after being called upon by the Governor with executing the laws of the state, suppressing insurrection, repelling invasion, or promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state. Arrest powers are limited in scope in that the arrest must be made with the immediate intent to deliver the person in custody to civil authorities.

==Awards and decorations==
The OHMR issues multiple awards and decorations to its members, and allows members to wear OHMR-approved ribbons from the State Guard Association of the United States. Members are also permitted to be awarded certain State of Ohio, Ohio National Guard awards when approved by the Adjutant General of the State of Ohio.

<text>Georg Benedikt Winer (13 April 1789, Leipzig – 12 May 1858, Leipzig), German Protestant theologian, known for his linguistic studies of the New Testament. Theologically, Winer was an &quot;anti-trinitarian&quot;.

==Life==
He studied theology at Leipzig, where in 1819 he began work as a curator at the Universitätsbibliothek Leipzig. In 1823 he became a full professor of theology at the University of Erlangen, then in 1832 returned to Leipzig, where he worked in a similar role as in Erlangen. On several separate occasions he served as dean to the theological faculty, and in 1842 was named university rector.

From 1824 to 1830 he edited with J. G. V. Engelhardt, the &quot;Neues kritisches Journal der theologischen Literatur&quot;, and alone from 1826 to 1832, the &quot;Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie&quot;. He is well known as the author of a &quot;Grammatik des neutestamentlichen Sprachidioms&quot; (1821, 8th edition, revised by P. W. Schmiedel, 1894 ff.), of which several translations have appeared, one of them being by W. F. Moulton (1870, 3rd edition 1882; &quot;A Treatise on the Grammar of New Testament Greek&quot;).

His other works include:

* &quot;Komparative Darstellung des Lehrbegriffs der verschiedenen christlichen Kirchenpartheien&quot; (1824; 4th edition by P. Ewald, 1882; English translation as &quot;A comparative view of the doctrines and confessions of the various communities of Christendom&quot;, 1873).
* &quot;Biblisches Realwörterbuch&quot; (1820; 3rd edition 1847–1848, 2 volumes) – Biblical dictionary.
* &quot;Grammatik des biblischen und targumischen Chaldaismus&quot; (1824; 3rd edition by B Fischer, &quot;Chaldäische Grammatik für Bibel und Talmud&quot;, 1882; English translation as &quot;Grammar of the Chaldee Language as contained in the Bible and the Targums&quot;, 1842).
* &quot;Handbuch der theologischen Literatur&quot; (1820; 3rd edition 1838–1840, 2 volumes; supplement, 1842) – Handbook of theological literature.

<text>== Belgicism ==
Belgicism, (; ) sometimes pejoView history☀(; )☂ratively referred to as Belgian Nationalism , is a nationalist ideology. In its modern form it favours the reversal of federalism and the creation of a unitary state in Belgium. The ideology advocates reduced or no autonomy for the Flemish Community who constitute Flanders, the French Community of Belgium and the German-speaking Community of Belgium who constitute Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region which is inhabited by both Walloons and Flemings, and the dissolution of the regional counterparts of each ethnic group within Belgium.

It insists on restoring total sovereignty to the level of the Belgian state by reverting Belgium to a unitary state, after decades of state structure reforms that made Belgium a federal state since the 1970s. This position is contrary to Flemish nationalists who advocate the independence of their region, and Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking regionalists who advocate more autonomy to their respective regions. Belgian nationalists advocate the unity between all language groups in Belgium, and condemn each perceived chauvinistic or linguistic discrimination, advocate the knowledge of all official languages (Dutch, French, German) and a multicultural, tolerant, strong feeling of citizenship.

Belgian nationalism is mainly supported by French-speaking politicians and certain circles in Brussels and also some sections of the far right. Because the Flanders region is by large majority regionalist (with a minority seeking independence) and because both the Wallonia and Brussels regions and the German community are also by majority regionalist, there is no popular support for Belgian nationalism in any region of Belgium, and political parties that support this ideology openly have not gained electoral support in the modern era (although the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium, which opposes regionalism and dividing the country by language but is not nationalist, saw its support rise in the late 2010s), so it remains much weaker than the secessionist and regional nationalisms of the ethnic groups.

==History==
Belgian nationalism first emerged during the Brabant Revolution (1789–1790), when the Austrian Netherlands rebelled against Habsburg rule, creating the short-lived United Belgian States in what is now Belgium, which only lasted from January to December 1790.
It again emerged in 1830 during the Belgian Revolution, when Belgium rebelled against and gained independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

One of the first people to create an intellectual foundation for Belgian nationalism was the Walloon historian Henri Pirenne, who argued for the existence of a distinct Belgian nation in his book series Histoire de Belgique.

==Advocates==

===Current===
* Belgian Union (BUB), a centrist unionist political party, officially bilingual but in practice mainly Dutch-speaking.

<text>Società Sportiva Calcio Bari, commonly referred to as SSC Bari and simply Bari, is an Italian football club based in Bari, Apulia. Bari currently plays in the . The team finished the 2021–22 season in first place in Serie C and earned promotion to Serie B for the 2022–23 season. 

Bari was originally founded in 1908 and reestablished several times, most recently in 2018. The club spent many seasons bouncing between the top two divisions in Italian football, Serie A and Serie B. The club was formerly known as AS Bari or FC Bari 1908 as well as other names, due to re-establishing. Bari usually plays in all-white with red detailing.

Statistically, Bari is the most successful club from the Apulia region in terms of all-time Serie A records. The club is among the elite in Southern Italian football and is ranked 17th in the all-time Serie A records. The club won the Mitropa Cup in 1990.

==History==

===Foundation===

Bari Foot-Ball Club was founded in the city on 15 January 1908. Like the majority of early Italian football clubs, foreign people were involved in the foundation of the club. Amongst the main founders were German Floriano Ludwig, Swiss Gustavo Kuhn, and a native trader of Bari called Giovanni Tiberini. Originally, the club wore red shirts with white shorts; early on, they would play against English sailors at the San Lorenzo field in the San Pasquale area of Bari.

Although the club was founded early on, clubs from Southern Italy were not significantly represented in the early Italian football championships; due to that, Bari did not immediately participate in the early national leagues. During World War I, the original club became inactive before being reorganized in 1924 under the same name.

By this time, other clubs from the city had begun playing too, including &quot;Foot-Ball Club Liberty&quot; which originally wore blue and white stripes and were founded as a dissident club from the original Bari in 1909 and their rivals &quot;Unione Sportiva Ideale&quot; who wore green and black stripes and was founded in 1908. It was FBC Liberty who became the first ever side from the Province of Bari to take part in the Italian Football Championship; this was during the 1921–22 CCI season when the main clubs in the country had a falling out with FIGC.

The following season Ideale became the first side from Bari to progress to the Southern Italian semi-finals round but lost out to Lazio. All three clubs featured in the championship for the first time in 1924–25; while FBC Bari were relegated and ceased to exist again in 1927, Liberty, on the other hand, reached the Southern semi-finals before losing out heavily to Alba Roma.

===Unione Sportiva Bari===
During the 1926-1928 period, the whole of Italian football was changing and beginning to become more organized. Several mergers were taking place in Naples, Florence, and Rome around the same time. FBC Liberty opted to change their name to Bari FC and first used it on 6 February 1927 in a match against Audace Taranto; then, on 27 February 1928, Bari FC merged with US Ideale to create Unione Sportiva Bari. The US Bari retook the red and white colours of FBC Bari.

After the Italian Championship of 1928–29, the league system was reorganized and Bari was placed in Serie B. One of their players was called up in the Italy national football team that season for the first time, in the form of Raffaele Costantino; this made Bari the first Serie B club to contribute a player and a scorer to the national side.

===Between Serie A and Serie B===
The 1930s and 1940s were Bari&#x27;s golden age, spending much of that time in Serie A, with a finish of seventh in 1947 being the best they achieved.

In the 1950s, Bari went into a sharp decline and an equally rapid revival towards the end of the decade to spend three more years in Serie A (1958–61). Stars of the team in this period included Biagio Catalano and Raúl Conti. The club returned to Serie A twice more in this period (1963–64 and 1969–70), with the latter proving especially harrowing with only 11 goals scored, the lowest of any top-flight club. In 1974, Bari descended to Serie C, finishing that season with only 12 goals scored and 26 conceded in 38 games.
By the late 1970s, Bari were back in Serie B and on something of an upward swing, narrowly missing promotion in 1982. They managed promotion to Serie A in 1985 and acquired English players Gordon Cowans and Paul Rideout, but they were unable to prevent an instant return to Serie B.

A return to Serie A in 1989 with stars including stalwart defender Giovanni Loseto, midfielder Pietro Maiellaro and Brazilian striker João Paulo saw a respectable 10th-place finish in 1990, their last season at the Della Vittoria. The following season saw Bari move to the San Nicola stadium, built for the 1990 World Cup, but by 1992, despite the signing of David Platt, they would be relegated once more.

Promotion in 1994 saw another two-year stay in Serie A with Igor Protti clinching league topscorer in 1995–96 season, and another promotion in 1997 saw the emergence of promising youngsters like Nicola Ventola, Gianluca Zambrotta, Antonio Cassano and Diego De Ascentis. This time, they managed a four-year stay in Serie A under the guidance of Eugenio Fascetti, despite his uneasy relationship with many sections of the club&#x27;s support. The club has since had a generally indifferent spell in Serie B. However, having been near the top of the Serie B table for much of the 2008–09 season, they gained promotion to Serie A on 8 May 2009, under the guidance of Antonio Conte.

In November 2009, a take-over bid was rejected. A Texas-based company JMJ Holdings also gave an intent to take over in August 2009.

With Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Ranocchia as centre-back and Barreto as striker, Bari performed well in the first half of the season. Eventually, Bari finished 10th. However, Bari lost €19 million in 2009 financial year, which meant Bari was quiet in the 2010 summer window and in the January 2011 transfer window, they failed to find a replacement of Bonucci and Ranocchia. The company recovered from negative equity due to an increase in TV income, as well as the sale of Bonucci (a profit of €6.45 million). Bari had a positive equity of €870,653 on 31 December 2010 and a net income of 14 million in the 2010 calendar year due to extraordinary income from selling the brand.

Bari were relegated to Serie B after the 2010–11 season, finishing 17 points short of 17th placed Lecce. During the season, manager Giampiero Ventura was replaced by Bortolo Mutti in a failed attempt to save the club from relegation. On 4 March 2011, Bari played its 1,000th game in Serie A.

===The end of the Matarrese reign===
On 13 June 2011, President Vincenzo Matarrese and the rest of the board of directors resigned after 28 years of controlling the club. Vincenzo Torrente was brought in to manage the side in the summer of 2011, and much of the playing roster was let go due to financial difficulties at the club and replaced by young players. Despite six and seven-point penalties in the following two seasons, Bari under Torrente was able to achieve mid-table Serie B finishes; however, disconcertingly, attendances continued to dwindle. In the summer of 2013, Torrente resigned and was replaced by Carmine Gautieri, who also resigned after two weeks. The top job was then assigned to Roberto Alberti Mazzaferro.

The financial position of the club continued to decline, and the Mattarese family reduced the amount of money they put into the club. The club&#x27;s debt reached €30m in February 2014. The club was declared bankrupt on 10 March 2014. The first bankruptcy auction, on 18 April 2014, was declared deserted due to the lack of a bid that met all of the criteria. The second auction, on 12 May 2014, also failed to find a successful bidder. The club was in real danger of disappearing.

===FC Bari 1908===
The third bankruptcy auction was held on 20 May 2014 with an asking price for the club of just €2m. A consortium FC Bari 1908 S.p.A. led by former Serie A referee Gianluca Paparesta successfully acquired the club assets and sports title. A strong spell of form towards the end of the season, where the club lost just two of its last 15 Serie B matches, meant that Bari qualified for the 2013–14 Serie B play-offs. Bari met Crotone in the quarter-finals and won 3–0, setting up a clash against Latina, the side that finished 3rd in the regular season. The first leg of the play-off semifinal was a sell-out with over 50,000 people attending the match, an incredible achievement considering the club recorded an attendance of less than 1,000 just a few months earlier. Bari were knocked out due to two draws (2–2 and 2–2).

In 2014–15, the team ended the season in 10th place. In 2015–16, Bari gained 5th place in the league and subsequent access to the play-off preliminary match against Novara but lost 3–4 after extra time at Stadio San Nicola.

In December 2015, Cosmo Giancaspro acquired 5% of Bari&#x27;s shares. In April 2016 Noordin Ahmad signed a preliminary agreement to acquire 50% shares of the club but the deal collapsed; In June 2016 Cosmo Giancaspro became the sole director () of the club, after the entire share capital were acquired by an Italian company Kreare Impresa S.r.l. According to &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, Kreare Impresa was owned by Giancaspro, but both Giancaspro and his company was involved in a money laundering investigation.

===A new beginning: SSC Bari===
On 16 July 2018, Bari were excluded by Co.Vi.Soc. from participating in 2018–19 Serie B due to financial reasons. The shareholders also tried to recapitalize the club and appeal the exclusion to Collegio di Garanzia of Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI), however, it was rejected.

Thanks to the Article 52 of N.O.I.F., Aurelio De Laurentiis, the owner of football club Napoli and film company Filmauro, had won the rights to establish a phoenix club of Bari and restart in 2018–19 Serie D. He also re-established the current Napoli in 2004. The new club will be named &quot;SSC Bari&quot;, with De Laurentiis stating his intention to return it to Serie A as soon as possible. The club was subsequently assigned to Group I of 2018–19 Serie D, traditionally destined to teams from Sicily and Calabria.

On 23 August 2018, as part of a press conference, Aurelio De Laurentiis announced his eldest son, film producer Luigi De Laurentiis Jr., as the new Bari chairman.

Bari was promoted to Serie C at the end of the 2018–19 season. In the following seasons, the club was always touted as a major contender for promotion to Serie B.

In the 2019–20 campaign, Bari ended the season in second place behind Reggina and then made it all the way to the playoff final, where they were defeated by Reggiana after extra time, thus missing on immediate promotion to the Italian second division. Following a fourth-place finish in the next season, the club hired Michele Mignani as head coach and strengthened the squad even further: this proved to be successful, as Bari won Group C and gained promotion to Serie B on 3 April 2022, with four games yet to go. In their first season return to Serie B, Bari made it to the promotion playoff finals at home, lossing to Cagliari due to an injury-time goal by Leonardo Pavoletti, thus missing out on a second consecutive promotion.

<text>The common basilisk (Basiliscus basiliscus) is a species of lizard in the family Corytophanidae. The species is endemic to Central America and South America, where it is found near rivers and streams in rainforests. It is also known as the Jesus Christ lizard, Jesus lizard, South American Jesus lizard, or  for its ability to run on the surface of water.

==Description==
The common basilisk can be distinguished from similar species within its range by its large size and the high fin-like crest along its back. Most common basilisks are brown and cream in color. Males also have high crests on the head and tail. Both sexes are brown to olive, and have a white, cream, or yellow stripe on the upper lip and a second stripe along either side of the body; these stripes have higher contrast in juveniles and fade as the lizards age.

Hatchlings weigh a mere and are long. Adults can grow to a total length (including tail) of 76 cm (2.5 feet). Females are generally , and weigh half as much as males. The tail comprises 70 to 75% of the total length: for example, a 70-cm-long (27.5-inch-long) common basilisk would have a 50-cm-long (19.5-inch-long) tail. The common basilisk has a large mouth with saw-like teeth on the inner sides of the jaw. While the common basilisk is most known for its ability to run on water, it is also an excellent climber and swimmer, and has been known to stay underwater for up to half an hour. The average lifespan is seven years in captivity; in the wild, it tends to be less because of predators.

When startled, the common basilisk escapes by speeding to the nearest edge of water—and continues sprinting. The lizard runs on only its hind legs in an erect position, holding its forelegs to its sides. The common basilisk is adroit on water because its feet are large and equipped with flaps of skin along the toes that allow it to catch on tiny air bubbles. When moving quickly, the lizard can cross a surface of water before sinking. On water, it runs at an average speed of , which is just a little slower than its speed on land. Younger basilisks can run on water, while adults cross only a few meters before sinking. Adults do not move slowly, but they weigh more and cannot sprint for as long a time. Once a basilisk submerges, it continues swimming until it is sufficiently far from its pursuer — if the predator has followed past the bank. Although the common basilisk stays close to water to escape terrestrial predators, it swims only when necessary because some other aquatic animals would eat it given the chance.

==Geographic range and habitat==
The common basilisk is found in tropical rainforests throughout Central America and in northwestern South America, usually living in low elevations, from sea level to . In Costa Rica, this basilisk can be found as high as in some places. The species ranges from southwestern Nicaragua to northwestern Colombia on the Pacific side, and from central Panama to northwestern Venezuela on the Atlantic side. In Costa Rica, it is mostly found on the Pacific side of the country. The equivalent species on the Atlantic side is the green basilisk (&quot;Basiliscus plumifrons&quot;), which occupies similar habitats and has similar biology. also recently being found in South Florida.

==Diet==
&quot;B. basiliscus&quot; is an omnivore; its diet consists of insects, for example, beetles or dragon flies; flowers, and small vertebrates such as snakes, birds, eggs, and fish.

==Predators==
The common basilisk has many natural predators; large reptiles, birds, and some mammals. To avoid predators, it can conceal itself under leaves on the forest floor and can remain motionless for a long time. When the common basilisk must flee, though, its skill of running on water can help it avoid many predators, and when the common basilisk can no longer run on the water, it will use its strong swimming capabilities to continue underwater.

==Reproduction==
Females of &quot;B. basiliscus&quot; lay three to four clutches of 10–20 eggs a year. Eggs hatch after about three months and the young weigh about two grams and are up to three inches long. Their outstanding camouflage allows them to remain undetected when they remain still.

==Walking on water==

The common basilisk, along with the other members of its genus, take the nickname the &quot;Jesus Christ lizard&quot; or &quot;Jesus lizard&quot; because when fleeing from predators, they gather sufficient momentum to run across the water for a brief distance while holding most of their body out of the water (similar to the biblical story of Jesus walking on water). Basilisks have large hind feet with scaly fringes on the sides of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. These are compressed against the toes when this lizard walks on land; but if it senses danger, it can jump into the water, opening up these fringes against the water&#x27;s surface. This increases the surface area of the foot, thus allowing it to run on the water for short distances. This occurs in three steps. First is the slap, the downward movement of the foot that pushes water out and away from the leg. This also created pockets of air around the foot. Next is the stroke, the backwards movement of the foot, which propels it forward. Next is the recovery, when the foot comes up and out of the water and prepares to do the slap again. Smaller basilisks can run about without sinking. Juveniles can usually run farther than older basilisks, while holding more of their body above the water.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The common basilisk is named for the creature of Greek mythology made up of parts of a rooster, snake, and lion which could turn a man to stone by its gaze: the basilisk. Its generic, specific, and common names all derive from the Greek &quot;basilískos&quot; (βασιλίσκος), meaning &#x27;little king&#x27;. The specific epithet was given in Carl Linnæus&#x27; 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturæ&quot;.

<text>Francis Lister Hawks (June 10, 1798 – September 26, 1866) was an American writer, historian, educator and priest of the Episcopal Church. After practicing law with some distinction (and a brief stint as politician in North Carolina), Hawks became an Episcopal priest in 1827 and proved a brilliant and impressive preacher, holding livings (a church benefice including revenues) in New Haven, Philadelphia, New York City and New Orleans, and declining several bishoprics. However, scandals during the 1830s and 40s led him to posts on the American frontier and rejection of his selection as bishop of Mississippi, Hawks was the first president of the University of Louisiana (now known as Tulane University) Hawks then moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and eventually returned to New York City.

Hawks&#x27;s major contributions now seem literary. He edited the single volume Appletons&#x27; Cyclopaedia of Biography (1856), which added American biographies to the volume edited by Elihu Rich and published in 1854 by Richard Griffin &amp; Company (London). Hawks&#x27; church history works remain important today. After being named the Episcopal Church&#x27;s historiographer in 1835, Hawks traveled to England and collected materials afterwards utilized in his &quot;Contributions to the Ecclesiastical History of U.S.A.&quot; (New York, 1836–1839). The first two volumes dealt with Maryland and Virginia, while two later ones (1863, 1864) were devoted to Connecticut.

==Early life and career==
Hawks was born in New Bern, North Carolina. He graduated from the state university, now known as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in 1815, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. He then entered the practice of law. He represented New Bern in the North Carolina House of Commons in 1821. Hawks also became active in the Episcopal Church, where he took the post of lay reader of his parish. Hawks felt drawn to the ministry and entered the tutelage of Bishop John Stark Ravenscroft.

Hawks quickly climbed the church ranks, becoming deacon in 1827 and assistant minister of Trinity parish in New Haven, Connecticut, a short while later. His preaching was widely praised, and in short order, he was ordained a priest. His next post was as assistant to Bishop White of St. James&#x27; Church in Philadelphia. He next took a position as Professor of Divinity at Washington College (now Trinity College) in Hartford, Connecticut.

==Rectorships==
In 1831, Hawks took his first church appointment, as rector of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church on the corner of Broome and Chrystie streets in New York City. There his sermons attracted a large congregation. On 4 October, a mere nine months since he had moved to St. Stephens&#x27;, the congregation of nearby St. Thomas Church called upon him to take over as their rector. The position offered $1,500 in annual salary with an additional $500 for other expenses. Hawks turned the offer down. St. Thomas did not give up, and Hawks eventually accepted their offer on 17 December, becoming the third rector for St. Thomas Church.

Hawks&#x27;s new church experienced a boom in membership after his arrival. Much of the congregation of St. Stephen&#x27;s followed him to the new post, and many more congregants began attending as Hawks&#x27;s fame for oratory spread. Eventually, the church had to be expanded with a gallery to contain the overflow. Hawks&#x27;s Bible classes had an average attendance of 100 students. Philip Hone, ex-mayor of New York City, spoke for many when he wrote, &quot;I went yesterday morning to St. Thomas&#x27; where I heard from Dr. Hawks a glorious sermon.&quot; Praise came from other clergymen, as well. Bishop Thomas March Clark of Rhode Island wrote:

To hear him preach was like listening to the harmonies of a grand organ with its various stops and solemn sub-bass and tremulous pathetic reeds. The rector of one of the Washington churches, where Daniel Webster was an attendant, told me that after Dr. Hawks had preached for him on a Sunday morning, Mr. Webster said that it was the greatest sermon he had ever heard.

In 1833, Hawks&#x27;s salary rose to $3000 with an additional $500 allowed for other expenditures; this made him the highest paid clergyman in the United States. He also received an assistant rector for St. Thomas. He was elected bishop of the Southwestern region in 1835, but he declined the post, citing a lack of support for his family in what was then the American frontier.

== Additional church work ==
Hawks continued to participate in other church affairs, as well. In 1832, he was appointed assistant secretary to the House of Deputies of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church. In 1833, he took a part-time post as Professor of Ecclesiastical History and Pulpit Eloquence at the General Theological Seminary. The following year, Hawks was named secretary of the New York diocesan convention in New York City.

Church history was another of Hawks&#x27;s interests, and his writings are an important source on the early American church. In 1835, the General Convention named Hawks &quot;Conservator of all books, pamphlets and manuscripts of this church.&quot;

Hawks&#x27;s interest in history led him to London in 1835. There he copied important historical documents, which he used as material for a two-volume work on the church history of Maryland and Virginia. He also wrote some nine titles under the pen name &quot;Uncle Philip&quot; for the publishers Harper &amp; Brothers, which appeared in their Harper&#x27;s Boy&#x27;s and Girl&#x27;s Library imprint series.

While in London Hawks met the American traveller John Lloyd Stephens, later to be renowned for his exploratory work and investigations of a number of mostly-unknown ancient ruins of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization in Central America. Stephens had just completed a nine-month tour of Egypt and the Levant, and several letters describing his travels had been published in an American periodical. His acquaintance with Hawks encouraged Stephens to write a book on his Middle Eastern adventures, which was a popular success. Sixteen years later, Hawks wrote Stephens&#x27; obituary, as the adventurer died at age 47 from a liver illness, the article appeared in the first issue of &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;. He noted how &quot;[i]n repeated conversations with the present writer, the attention of Mr. Stephens was [first] called to the ruins of Guatemala and Yucatan&quot;; the two books Stephens had later written on his explorations of that region are regarded as foundational works in the then-young science of American archaeology.

Hawks continued to write and publish on general church affairs.In 1837, he partnered with fellow priest Caleb S. Henry to put out a magazine called the &quot;New York Review&quot;. The publication, a response to the Unitarian &quot;North American Review&quot;, published until 1842. He helped start &quot;The Church Record&quot;, a journal of Christian education, in 1843, and in 1853 &quot;The Church Journal&quot;. In 1851, Hawks had accepted the post of Historiographer of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and held it until his death.

==Scandal and later life==
In late 1838, Hawks became one of many targets of a trend among the American penny press to expose alleged vices of holy men. The accuser was George Washington Dixon, a man known for his blackface music act, who claimed that Hawks was engaging in sexual affairs. Hawks charged Dixon with libel on 31 December 1838. After a heated trial, Dixon pled guilty on 10 and 11 May 1839. The reasons for this remain a mystery, though Dale Cockrell surmised that Hawks did not want to face further defamation of character in trial and may have paid Dixon off. Dixon claimed so in 1841. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;[he] may explain and explain till doomsday—but these facts and their inferences [will] adhere.&quot;

Another scandal erupted closer to home. Hawks had opened a boys&#x27; school in 1839 in Flushing, Queens. The school had financial difficulties and was failing within three years, and Hawks was accused of mismanaging the funds. This proved one scandal too many. Hawks resigned from St. Thomas Church on 21 October 1843.

During the period 1838–1839, he published four titles under the pseudonym Lambert Lily.

Over the next decade, Hawks bounced from church to church. He first moved to a church in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on the American frontier and far from the disgrace of New York. There he went to work starting another school. At the Mississippi Diocesan Convention of 1844, Hawks took center stage due primarily to his endeavors to create a Diocesan school. When the Convention called for the election of the Diocese&#x27;s first bishop, Hawks was tapped. His episcopal confirmation at the General Convention was protested, with James Quarterman, a painter from Flushing, alleging that Hawks had over $100,000 in outstanding debt due to financial mismanagement at St. Thomas. Though Hawks successfully defended himself and the General Convention expressed their support for him, they discharged his consent back to the Diocese of Mississippi. In the end, Hawks turned the post down. He instead moved to Christ Church in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In 1847, he was named the first president of the University of Louisiana, known today as Tulane University. Then in 1849, he returned to New York City to pastor Calvary Church. He stayed there until 1862. Hawks declined most non-clerical appointments during his time at Calvary, including an election to the Rhode Island episcopate in 1852 and a professorship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1859. He continued to write, and in 1855 and 1856 he co-authored the &quot;Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan&quot; with Commodore Matthew Perry.
During the American Civil War, Hawks moved to Christ Church in Baltimore, Maryland. By 1861 he was editing again, this time with William Stevens Perry on the &quot;Journal of the General Conventions&quot;. He began as editor of &quot;Documentary History of the Protestant Episcopal Church&quot; in 1863 and held the post until 1864. He later gave the endowment for St. Mark&#x27;s Church-in-the-Bowery Chair of Ecclesiastical History at the General Seminary. He returned once more to New York City in 1865, where he helped to start the Chapel of the Holy Saviour on 25th Street. Another project was a Spanish-speaking church called Iglesia de Santiago, where Hawks preached on occasion. Hawks died on 26 September 1866. After a funeral at Calvary Church, he was buried at Christ Church in Greenwich, Connecticut.

<doc id="1138719" wikidata="Q6939503" url="?curid=1138719" title="Murray Tyrrell">
<text>Murray Louis Tyrrell, (1 December 1913 – 13 July 1994) was an Australian public servant who served as the Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia for a record 26 years, from 1947 to 1973, in which he served six governors-general.

==Early life==

Born in Kilmore, Victoria, Tyrrell was the third of five children of Thomas Michael Tyrrell, postmaster, and his wife Florence Evelyn (née Kepert). Tyrrell was educated at Orbost and Mordialloc and Melbourne Boys&#x27; High Schools. He married Ellen (Nell) St Clair Greig on 6 May 1939. They had three children.

==Career==
Tyrrell served for over 45 years in the Australian Public Service. For most of this time he was assistant secretary or personal secretary to a succession of Ministers including the Prime Minister, Ben Chifley.

Tyrrell succeeded Rear Admiral Sir Leighton Bracegirdle as Official Secretary to the Governor-General, William McKell, in March 1947. Tyrrell also served McKell&#x27;s successors Sir William Slim, Lord Dunrossil, Lord De L&#x27;Isle, Lord Casey and Sir Paul Hasluck. The Queen named him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order for his service rendered during the Royal Visit in 1954. He was also appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1959.

Tyrrell had a small but pivotal role to play in the establishment of the Australian Conservation Foundation. The ACF began in the second half of 1964, after a suggestion was made to Tyrrell by The Duke of Edinburgh while visiting Australia in 1963. He voiced an idea that Australia could become involved in conservation by establishing a branch of the World Wildlife Fund. Tyrrell convened a meeting that came to the conclusion that, if a conservation body was to exist, its efforts should be directed at conserving Australia&#x27;s own heritage. From this the ACF emerged.

Tyrrell was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1968, during Lord Casey&#x27;s term. This was awarded for personal service to the Queen, and was not on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. He had been attached to The Royal Household at Buckingham Palace from May to August 1962. After his retirement in 1973, he was succeeded by David Smith. In 1977, he was named the Australian of the Year, jointly with Dame Raigh Roe.

Tyrrell lived at 11 Blundell Street, Queanbeyan, New South Wales, in an old heritage cottage still called &quot;Sir Murray Tyrrell&#x27;s Cottage&quot;. He was an Alderman of the Queanbeyan City Council from 1976 to 1980.

Tyrrell died on 13 July 1994 in Canberra at the age of 80.

<text>Canning Half Tide Dock on the River Mersey, in Liverpool, England, is a half tide dock and is part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Canning Dock to the east and Albert Dock to the south.

==History==

The dock was originally the site of the Gut, the entrance to the Dry Dock which was later to become Canning Dock. Canning Half Tide Dock was built by Jesse Hartley between 1842 and 1844, also opening in 1844.

Originally having two lock entrances to the Mersey, the north gates were sealed with a concrete dam in 1937. The south gates are modified to accommodate a valve to admit river water. To the outside of the river entrances are two granite octagonal gatemen&#x27;s shelters, also designed by Hartley. An island built of masonry, which has its own lighthouse, separates the river entrances.
Adjacent to the dock is the Pilotage Building, which opened in 1883 to manage the river&#x27;s pilot boats. The building was converted in 1980 by the Building Design Partnership for use as a museum. Both this building and the dock itself are now part of Merseyside Maritime Museum.

<text>Enterprise Rent-A-Car is an American car rental agency headquartered in Clayton, Missouri, in Greater St. Louis. Enterprise is the flagship brand of Enterprise Holdings, which also owns other agencies including Alamo Rent a Car and National Car Rental. The company has historically concentrated on what it calls &quot;home city&quot; rentals, often people renting a car while their own was being repaired, but has expanded to airport-based rentals, especially after its parent company&#x27;s acquisition of Alamo and National in 2007. 

In addition to car rental, Enterprise Holdings also markets other transportation services under the Enterprise name including commercial fleet management, used car sales under the name Enterprise Car Sales, and commercial truck rental operations.

Enterprise Rent-A-Car was established in St. Louis, Missouri in 1957 by Jack C. Taylor. Originally known as &quot;Executive Leasing Company,&quot; in 1969, Taylor renamed the company &quot;Enterprise&quot; after the aircraft carrier , on which he served during World War II.

==Company information==
Enterprise Rent-A-Car is the largest rental car company in the United States, with more than 9,000 &quot;home city&quot; locations, and over 230 airport locations.

Enterprise Rent-A-Car&#x27;s primary focus is the local rental car market, specializing in car rentals to consumers who need a replacement car as the result of an accident, mechanical repair, theft, or who require a vehicle for a special occasion such as a short business or leisure trip. In 1995, Enterprise Rent-A-Car also began expanding its operations to include the airport market, and now serves airports in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, and Ireland. The company&#x27;s initial entry into Europe came in 1994.

Enterprise rents a wide variety of vehicles that range from economy cars to exotic vehicles. It also rents commercial cargo vans, pickup trucks and box trucks under the Enterprise Truck Rental brand.

By 2005, Enterprise Rent-A-Car&#x27;s customer service has been recognized seven times by J.D. Power and Associates as highest in customer satisfaction for rental car companies at or near airports. The company was named ninth on &quot;Business Week&#x27;s&quot; top 25 companies customer service list in 2007.

In 2006, &quot;Business Week&quot; listed Enterprise among the top 10 places to begin a career. Although the company&#x27;s pay for management trainees was among the lowest on the list (at an average $34,000), &quot;those who catch on&quot; quickly get a chance to run a branch office with the responsibility to generate a profit. Certain requirements and qualifications must be met to get promoted to an assistant manager, and many of these qualifications may depend on the employees&#x27; sales and their success in the company&#x27;s management training program. According to &quot;BusinessWeek&#x27;s&quot; list of &quot;Best Places to Launch a Career&quot;, Enterprise was in the top 15. Within five years, a successful manager may take positions at headquarters or become an area manager responsible for multiple branches.

In addition to renting vehicles, Enterprise sells vehicles that are displaced from its fleet at used car dealerships nationwide as Enterprise Car Sales.

== International growth ==
 Enterprise Rent-A-Car operates the largest rental network globally. With a network of approximately 9,500 car rental locations in nearly 100 countries and territories by October 2020, Enterprise Rent-A-Car has continued to expand into new locations well into 2021.

Several countries within the Enterprise network are operated through franchise partnerships.

Some of the international countries in which Enterprise operate include Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

==Controversies==
===Safety===
During model years 2006–2008, 66,000 of the Chevrolet Impalas the company ordered were purchased without side-curtain airbags, saving the company $11.5 million ($175 per vehicle), though the airbags were standard in retail models. The practice, which the company notes does not &quot;violate any federal mandate&quot;, came to national attention when cars being retired from their rental fleet were sold with claims that side-curtain air bags were included. About 5,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Buick LaCrosses were also purchased with the side air bags omitted. Enterprise admitted that it inaccurately advertised and sold 745 Chevrolet Impalas—model years 2006 through 2008—that were identified online as having side air bags, when in fact they did not. A company spokesman said that it would inform customers who had bought the cars, and offer to buy them back from the customers.
According to Safety Research and Strategies, a safety research firm that regularly works with the automotive industry, deleting safety features is a highly unusual practice. &quot;I’ve never seen a standard safety feature removed from a vehicle. I’ve been doing this work for 17 years and, until now, had yet to see this happen,&quot; said Sean Kane of Safety Research and Strategies.

===Slogans===
In August 1998, Enterprise took legal action against car rental competitors Hertz and Advantage in regards to similarities between the companies&#x27; slogans. In 1994, Enterprise adopted the slogan &quot;We&#x27;ll pick you up.&quot; Four years later, the company felt that Hertz and Advantage were using slogans at the time that imitated its own too closely. Hertz rejected the claim, with the company&#x27;s assistant general counsel David Parkoff saying Hertz, &quot;believes that it can use the English language words &#x27;we&#x27;ll pick you up&#x27; and their variants in a descriptive/informational sense as it presently does and that Enterprise&#x27;s claim of trademark rights in those words is misplaced and does not prevent such use.&quot;

Months before, in May, a judge ruling ordered the Rent-a-Wreck of America rental agency to stop using slogans containing the phrase &quot;pick you up.&quot;

==Enterprise CarShare==

In 2008, Enterprise piloted its first on-campus carsharing program at Washington University in St. Louis. The program, called WeCar, was introduced at the University of South Florida in July 2009. , WeCar has 100 carsharing programs in more than 30 American states and Canada, and the service offers almost 100 electric cars and plug-in hybrids, including the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt.

By September 2013, WeCar was rebranded as Enterprise CarShare.

In April 2015 Enterprise acquired City Car Club in the United Kingdom, renaming it Enterprise Car Club.

==Sponsorships==
Enterprise Rent-A-Car is the official car rental service of the NCAA, NHL and the UEFA Europa League. From 2004 to 2010, it was a sponsor of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) circuit. In 2018, it entered into a 15-year agreement to hold the naming rights for Enterprise Center, the home arena of the St. Louis Blues.

<text>Brunswick Half Tide Dock on the River Mersey, England, was a half tide dock and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated near Brunswick Dock in the southern dock system, it only connected directly to the river.

The dock was built by Jesse Hartley, and opened around 1832.
Apart from the entrance channel, the dock has now been filled in.

<doc id="1138748" wikidata="Q7567221" url="?curid=1138748" title="South Ferry Basin">
<text>The South Ferry Basin is a tidal basin on the River Mersey, in England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated near the southern dock system, it is only connected directly to the river.

==History==
The basin was built c.1817–23 for use by fishermen and ferries. Around 1817, the &quot;Etna&quot; was built for ferrying passengers and vehicles from South Ferry Basin to Tranmere. From 4 April 1865 a ferry service was established between the South Ferry Basin and New Ferry on the Wirral Peninsula, with additional sailings to Liverpool Pier Head. Facilities at the basin consisted of a pontoon moored against the dock wall. The &quot;South End&quot; service appeared to be relatively short-lived, as by 1876, these facilities had been removed and sold for scrap.

This small basin was also known locally as the &#x27;Cocklehole&#x27; and was a place that Liverpool ceded to the poor cocklefishers and oystercatchers for the mooring and repair of their boats whilst the main port of Liverpool handled the large trade. It was little known under its own name and often confused as being part of Coburg Dock.

==Present==
The basin is open to the river and is currently heavily silted up. It isn&#x27;t used for anything. Although the basin remains unaltered, the surrounding area has since been redeveloped for residential purposes.

<text>The Loch Ard Gorge is part of Port Campbell National Park, Victoria, Australia, about three minutes&#x27; drive west of The Twelve Apostles.

==History==
The gorge is named after the clipper that was shipwrecked on 1 June 1878 near the end of a three-month journey from England to Melbourne. Of 54 passengers and crew, only two survived: Thomas Pearce, one of the ship&#x27;s apprentices; and Eva Carmichael, an Irishwoman emigrating with her family. Pearce and Carmichael were each 19 years old.

According to memorials at the site, Pearce was washed ashore, and rescued Carmichael from the water after hearing her cries for help. Pearce then climbed out of the gorge to raise the alarm to local pastoralists who quickly came to Carmichael&#x27;s rescue. Three months after the disaster, which claimed the lives of seven members of her family, Carmichael returned to Ireland. Pearce was hailed a hero, and the Victorian Humane Society awarded him its first Gold Medal. He died aged 49 and is buried in Southampton Old Cemetery, England.
At least four of &quot;Loch Ard&quot;″s passengers are buried nearby: Reginald Jones, Arthur Mitchell, Eva Carmichael&#x27;s elder sister Raby and their mother Rebecca. The bodies of many of the other passengers and crew were never found.

The arch of the nearby Island Archway collapsed in June 2009. The feature now appears as two unconnected rock pillars. They have since been officially named Tom and Eva after the two survivors of the &quot;Loch Ard&quot; wreck.
==General==
The gorge is accessed via the Great Ocean Road, northwest of The Twelve Apostles. Stairs allow visitors access to the beach and a pathway allows access to the eastern side of the gorge. There are numerous plaques and a small museum detailing the site&#x27;s history, as well as a rest area, and cemetery housing many of the people that died.

==Fauna==
The uncommon rufous bristlebird (&quot;Dasyornis broadbenti&quot;) is often observed around the Gorge.

==In films==
This was the location for a number of scenes of the 1982 film &quot;The Pirate Movie&quot; and also the 1999 TV series &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; with Treat Williams. The gorge hosted the final task and finish line for the third series of &quot;The Amazing Race Australia&quot;.

<text>Victor Renquist is a fictional character created by Mick Farren. He has appeared in a series of books known as &quot;The Renquist Quartet&quot;.

==Profile==
Born in the twelfth century, the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Victor Renquist grows up to become a sword for hire. When in his forties, he works for a breakaway Christian sect known as the Cathars during their hopeless last stand against the forces of Pope Innocent III, in which he is mortally wounded. To save his life, the Cathars call upon an entity known as Lamia the Great Vampire, who makes, or &quot;turns&quot; him to a vampire as well.

During the intervening centuries, Renquist survives not only on blood, but also by accepting jobs for various political and intelligence agencies. He has reputedly works for the Duke of Wellington, Nicholas II of Russia, and the NSA. Along the way, he has evaded capture by the Spanish Inquisition, the Knights of Sebastopol and the Gestapo.

As a vampire, he is faster, stronger, and hardier than a human. He is also able to read minds, brainwash and hypnotize people. He is vulnerable to radioactivity, both from natural (the Sun) and unnatural sources (such as nuclear devices). As their leader, he lives with at least four other vampires in a &quot;colony&quot; of vampires in an isolated residence in California.

Through the series, we are told of how vampires evolved from a warrior class created by an alien race called the Nephilim. The Nephilim conquered Earth millennia ago and tinkered with the primitive humans to create two classes: warrior (Nosferatu) and administrator (Urshuu). However, the Nephilim left Earth in antiquity, leaving their creations behind.

Over the course of the books, Renquist clashes with, variously, the Old God Cthulhu, the vampire Clan, Fenrior, members of his own colony, a Nazi society living in caverns under the ground (in an environment which is supposed to be the basis of the Hollow Earth), the mythic magician Merlin, a cult known as The Apogee, and the Dhrakuh, an ancient race of sentient reptiles (who it is implied are the basis of dragon legends).

<doc id="1138763" wikidata="Q5470121" url="?curid=1138763" title="Former Region 3 (Johannesburg)">
<text>Region 3 was an administrative district in the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, from 2000 to 2006, and was also known as the Sandton region, as it included the formerly independent municipality of Sandton, and many of the northern suburbs of the former Johannesburg municipality. It bordered Region 1 (Diepsloot), Region 2 (Midrand), Region 7 (Alexandra), Region 8 (Johannesburg Central), Region 4 (Northcliff), and Region 5 (Roodepoort). The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.

The area is fairly heavily populated with the large urban centre of Sandton located in the region, however there are also many parks with large biodiversity. This area is close to Johannesburg&#x27;s central business district. It is infamous for its heavy traffic, however in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development the government spent considerable sums of money investing in upgrades to the transportation network.

This economic activity in this area centres on business, and there is a lot of housing in this area.

== Demographics ==
According to the South African National Census of 2001, the population of Region 3 was 178,549 people. Whites accounting for 62.50% of the population, followed by Blacks at 32.35%, Asians and Coloureds at 5.15%. 15.6% of the population was under the age of 15, whilst 8.4% were over the age of 65. The median age in the city was 35 years old, and for every 100 females, there were 85.7 males. 4.6% of the labour force were unemployed.

63.1% of the region&#x27;s residents spoke English at home, 7.4% spoke Zulu, 6.2% spoke Afrikaans, 14.7% spoke other official languages, and 2.8% of the population spoke a non-official language at home.

3.3% of residents aged 20 and over received no schooling; 6.2% had some primary school; 3.0% completed only primary school; 18.9% had some high school education; 26.8% finished only high school and 41.7% had an education higher than the high school level. Overall, 68.5% of residents had completed high school. The median annual income of working adults aged 15–65 was ZAR 59 109.

Under the terms of the agreement, Colombo agreed to a devolution of power to the provinces, the Sri Lankan troops were to be withdrawn to their barracks in the north and the Tamil rebels were to surrender their arms.

Importantly however, the Tamil groups, notably the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) (which at the time was one of the strongest Tamil forces), had not been made party to the talks and initially agreed to surrender their arms to the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) only reluctantly. Within a few months however, this flared into an active confrontation. The LTTE declared their intent to continue the armed struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam and refused to disarm. The IPKF found itself engaged in a bloody police action against the LTTE. Further complicating the return to peace, a Marxist insurgency began in the south of the island.

==Background==
Sri Lanka, from the early part of the 1980s, was facing an increasingly violent ethnic strife. The origins of this conflict can be traced to the independence of the island from Britain in 1948. At the time, a Sinhala majority government was instituted which passed legislation that were deemed discriminatory against the substantial Tamil minority population. In the 1970s, two major Tamil parties united to form the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) that started agitation for a separate state of Tamil Eelam within the system in a federal structure in the north and eastern Sri Lanka that would grant the Tamils greater autonomy. However, enactment of the sixth amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution in August 1983 classified all separatist movements as unconstitutional, effectively rendering the TULF ineffective. Outside the TULF, however, factions advocating more radical and militant courses of action soon emerged, and the ethnic divisions started flaring into a violent civil war.

==Indian involvement==
According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy, Indian intervention in Sri Lankan civil war became inevitable as that civil war threatened India&#x27;s &quot;unity, national interest and territorial integrity.&quot; According to Laskar, this threat came in two ways: On the one hand external powers could take advantage of the situation to establish their base in Sri Lanka thus posing a threat to India, on the other hand, the LTTE&#x27;s dream of a sovereign Tamil Eelam comprising all the Tamil-inhabited areas (of Sri Lanka and India) posed a threat to India&#x27;s territorial integrity.

India had, initially under Indira Gandhi and later under Rajiv Gandhi, provided support to Tamil interests from the very conception of the secessionist movement. This included providing sanctuary to the separatists, as well as support the operations training camps for Tamil guerrillas in Tamil Nadu of which the LTTE emerged as the strongest force. This was both as a result of a large Tamil community in South India, as well as India&#x27;s regional security and interests which attempted to reduce the scope of foreign intervention, especially those linked to the United States, Pakistan, and China. To this end, the Indira Gandhi government sought to make it clear to Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene that armed intervention in support of the Tamil movement was an option India would consider if any diplomatic solutions should fail.
Following the anti-Tamil riots, the Tamil rebel movement grew progressively strong and increasingly violent. However, after Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, the Indian support for the militant movement decreased. However, the succeeding Rajiv Gandhi government attempted to re-establish friendly relations with its neighbours. It still however maintained diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the conflict as well as maintaining covert aid to the Tamil rebels.

From 1985 however, the Sri-Lankan Government started rearming itself extensively for its anti-insurgent role with support from Pakistan, Israel, Singapore and South Africa. In 1986, the campaign against the insurgency was stepped up and in 1987, retaliating an increasingly bloody insurgent movement, Operation Liberation was launched against LTTE strongholds in Jaffna Peninsula, involving nearly four thousand troops, supported by helicopter gunships as well as ground attack aircraft. In June 1987, the Sri Lankan Army laid siege on the town of Jaffna. As civilian casualties grew, calls grew within India to intervene in what was increasingly seen in the Indian (and Tamil) media as a developing humanitarian crisis, especially with reports use of aerial support against rebel positions in civilian areas. India, which had a substantial Tamil population in South India faced the prospect of a Tamil backlash at home, called on the Sri Lankan government to halt the offensive in an attempt to negotiate a political settlement.

However, the Indian efforts were futile. Added to this, in the growing involvement of Pakistani and Israeli advisors, it was necessary for Indian interest to mount a show of force. Failing to negotiate an end to the crisis with Sri Lanka, India announced on 2 June 1987 that it would send a convoy of unarmed ships to northern Sri Lanka to provide humanitarian assistance but this was intercepted by the Sri Lankan Navy and turned back.

Following the failure of the naval mission, the decision was made by the Indian government to mount an airdrop of relief supplies in support of rebel forces over the besieged city of Jaffna. On 4 June 1987, in a blatant show of force, the Indian Air Force mounted Operation Poomalai in broad daylight. Five An-32s of the Indian Air Force under cover of heavily armed Indian fighter jets flew over Jaffna to airdrop 25 tons of supplies, all the time keeping well within the range of Sri Lankan radar coverage. At the same time the Sri Lankan Ambassador to New Delhi was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed by the Minister of External Affairs, K. Natwar Singh, of the ongoing operation. It was also indicated to the ambassador that if the operation was in any way hindered by Sri Lanka, India would launch a full-force military retaliation against Sri Lanka. The ultimate aim of the operation was both to demonstrate the credibility of the Indian option of active intervention to the Sri Lankan Government, as a symbolic act of support for the Tamil Rebels, as well to preserve Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s credibility.

Faced with the possibility of an active Indian intervention and facing an increasingly war-weary population at home, the Sri Lankan President, J. R. Jayewardene, offered to hold talks with the Rajiv Gandhi government on future moves. The siege of Jaffna was soon lifted, followed by a round of negotiations that led to the signing of the Indo-Sri-Lankan accord on July 29, 1987 that brought a temporary truce. The terms of the truce specified that the Sri Lankan troops withdraw from the north and the Tamil rebels disarm, and saw the induction of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka.

==Peace accord==

Among the salient points of the agreement, the Sri Lankan Government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, which included Colombo devolution of power to the provinces, merger (subject to later referendum) of the northern and eastern provinces, and official status for the Tamil language. More immediately, Operation Liberation — the successful, ongoing anti-insurgent operation by Sri Lankan forces in the Northern peninsula — was ended. Sri Lankan troops were to withdraw to their barracks in the north, the Tamil rebels were to disarm.India agreed to end support for the Tamil separatist movement and recognise the unity of Sri Lanka. The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord also underlined the commitment of Indian military assistance on which the IPKF came to be inducted into Sri Lanka.

In 1990, India withdrew the last of its forces from Sri Lanka, and fighting between the LTTE and the government resumed.

In January 1995, the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE agreed to a ceasefire as a preliminary step in a government-initiated plan for peace negotiations. After 3 months, however, the LTTE unilaterally resumed hostilities.

The government of Sri Lanka then adopted a policy of military engagement with the Tigers, with government forces liberating Jaffna from LTTE control by mid-1996 and moving against LTTE positions in the northern part of the country called the Vanni. An LTTE counteroffensive, begun in October 1999, reversed most government gains; and by May 2000, threatened government forces in Jaffna. Heavy fighting continued into 2001.

===Reaction===
On the eve of the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, Rajiv Gandhi was assaulted by Leading Rate Vijitha Rohana at the Guard of Honour held for Gandhi in what seemed an attempted assassination. Four years later, in 1991, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber. This radically reduced support for the LTTE within India. In 2009, 19 years after his assassination, the Sri Lankan army mounted a major military offensive in the north and eradicated the LTTE. The operation was not opposed by India and received Indian diplomatic and military support, despite condemnations from state of Tamil Nadu and Western nations for alleged human rights violations. Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s widow, Sonia Gandhi was the chairperson of India&#x27;s ruling coalition at the time.

The validity of the Indo-Lanka Accord has been questioned by Sri Lankan politicians citing various reasons. In 2020 Minister of Public Security Sarath Weerasekara claimed as India failed to disarm the LTTE the agreement is no longer valid and Sri Lanka is not bound to uphold the agreement on provincial councils.

<doc id="1138773" wikidata="Q6238306" url="?curid=1138773" title="John Hawkshaw">
<text>Sir John Hawkshaw FRS FRSE FRSA MICE (9 April 1811 – 2 June 1891), was an English civil engineer. He served as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers 1862-63. His most noteworthy work is the Severn Tunnel.

==Early life==
He was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of Henry Hawkshaw, a hostler, and Sarah Carrington and was educated at Leeds Grammar School. Before he was 21, Hawkshaw was employed under Charles Fowler in the construction of turnpike roads in the West Riding of Yorkshire. This was followed by a period working in the office of Alexander Nimmo, the eminent Scottish Civil Engineer, who had been engaged by Lancashire investors to design a rail network to link Manchester, Leeds and the Humber. In the year of his majority, he obtained an appointment as engineer to the Bolivar Mining Association in Venezuela. The company was developing copper mines at Aroa in the west of the newly independent country. The mine relied on a combination of small boats and mule to transport the ore to Point Tucacas where it was shipped to England. During Hawkshaw&#x27;s short stay at Aroa, a new road was constructed to reduce the mule haulage distance, navigation of the River Aroa was improved to cater for larger boats and the route of a future railway line from the mine to the coast planned. Unfortunately, the climate at Aroa was more than Hawkshaw&#x27;s health could stand, and in 1834 he was obliged to return to England.

==Career==
He soon obtained employment under Jesse Hartley at the Liverpool docks, and subsequently was made engineer in charge of the railway and navigation works of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Company. In 1845 he became chief engineer to the Manchester and Leeds Railway, and in 1847 to its successor, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway for which he constructed a large number of branch lines. One such was the Manchester and Southport line surveyed by his associate Clement Wilks and as well as the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway near Heckmondwike. In 1850 he moved to London and began to practice as a consulting engineer, at first alone, but subsequently in partnership with Harrison Hayter. In that capacity his work was of an extremely varied nature, embracing almost every branch of engineering.

He retained his connection with the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Company until his retirement from professional work in 1888, and was consulted on all the important engineering points that affected it in that long period. In London he was responsible for the Charing Cross and Cannon Street railways, together with the two bridges which carried them over the Thames; he was engineer of the East London railway, which passed under the Thames through Sir Marc Brunel&#x27;s well-known tunnel; and jointly with Sir J Wolfe-Barry he constructed the section of the Underground railway which completed the inner circle between the Aldgate and Mansion House stations.

In addition, many railway works claimed his attention in all parts of the world—Germany, Russia, India, Mauritius, etc. One noteworthy point in his railway practice was his advocacy, in opposition to Robert Stephenson, of steeper gradients than had previously been thought desirable or possible, and so far back as 1838 he expressed decided disapproval of the maintenance of the broad gauge on the Great Western, because of the troubles he foresaw it would lead to in connection with future railway extension, and because he objected in general to breaks of gauge in the lines of a country.

The construction of canals was another branch of engineering in which John Hawkshaw was actively engaged. In 1862 he became a chief engineer of the Dutch North Sea Canal ship-canal.

According to a speech of Lord Houghton, he may be said to have been the saviour of the Suez Canal. About that time the scheme was in very bad odour, and the khedive determined to get the opinion of an English engineer as to its practicability, having made up his mind to stop the works if that opinion was unfavourable. Hawkshaw was chosen to make the inquiry, and it was because his report was entirely favourable that Ferdinand de Lesseps was able to say at the opening ceremony that to him he owed the canal. However, in his books with documents related to the Suez Canal, De Lesseps does not mention Hawkshaw.

As a member of the International Congress which considered the construction of an inter-ocean canal across Central America, he thought best of the Nicaragua route, and privately he regarded the Panama scheme as impracticable at a reasonable cost, although publicly he expressed no opinion on the matter and left the Congress without voting. Sir John Hawkshaw also had a wide experience in constructing harbours (e.g. Holyhead) and docks (e.g. Penarth, the Albert Dock at Hull, and South Dock (formerly the City Canal) of the West India Docks in London), in river-engineering, in drainage and sewerage, in water-supply, etc.
He was engineer, with Sir James Brunlees, of the original Channel Tunnel Company from 1872, but many years previously he had investigated for himself the question of a tunnel under the Strait of Dover from an engineering point of view, and had come to a belief in its feasibility, so far as that could be determined from borings and surveys. Subsequently, however, he became convinced that the tunnel would not be to the advantage of Great Britain, and thereafter would have nothing to do with the project. He was also consulting engineer to the Severn Tunnel, which, from its magnitude and the difficulties encountered in its construction, was one of the most notable engineering undertakings of the 19th century. Following the inundation of the tunnel working in 1879, he employed Thomas A. Walker as lead contractor to complete the work.
He also designed the famous Puerto Madero, the port of Buenos Aires, collaborating with Thomas A. Walker and James Murray Dobson. The works started its construction in 1885 and was finished in 1898.

He is also known for his construction of the Brighton sewerage system.

==Family==

In 1835 he married Ann Jackson (d.1885). Ann and John had six children: Mary Jane Jackson (1838), Ada (1840), John Clarke (1841), who was also a civil engineer, Henry Paul (1843), Editha (1845), and Oliver (1846). Ada died of hydrocephalus in 1845. Oliver died in 1856 having contracted typhoid fever while the family were holidaying in Pitlochry, Scotland.

He died in London on 2 June 1891.

==Honours and awards==
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1855.

In 1875, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were David Stevenson, James Leslie, Thomas Stevenson and Henry Charles Fleeming Jenkin.

He served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between December 1861 and December 1863.

He was knighted in 1873.

He was elected an honorary member of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1880.

A JD Wetherspoon pub located within Cannon Street station is named &quot;The Sir John Hawkshaw&quot;.

<text>Saint-Dié-des-Vosges (; , before 1999: &quot;Saint-Dié&quot;) is a commune in the Vosges department, Grand Est, northeastern France.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department.

==Geography==

Saint-Dié is located in the Vosges Mountains southeast of Nancy and southwest of Strasbourg. This route in the valley of the river Meurthe was always the more frequented, and first to get a rail line in 1864, so now it accommodates the primary road.

Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, principal town of an arrondissement of the same name, belongs to the Vosges &quot;département&quot; of France. This &quot;commune&quot; with a little town in her center, is approximately northeast of Épinal, and connected by two roads, south through the passes of Haut-Jacques and Bruyères or north by the pass of Haut-du-Bois and the ancient land of Rambervillers. By rail, Épinal is from Saint-Dié. The Saint-Dié-des-Vosges station offers rail connections to Épinal, Strasbourg, Nancy and Paris.

The river Meurthe flows in the Permian basin of Saint-Dié surrounded by wooded mountains Ormont, Kemberg and La Madeleine. The peaks of these mountains are high, and are composed of Triassic formations, especially the so-called &quot;Vosges sandstone&quot;, a kind of red sandstone.

==Features==
The town was nearly completely redesigned and rebuilt in the French Uniform Style after the fire of 1757. A major part was destroyed in November 1944 and was rebuilt largely in a material imitating red sandstone. Its cathedral has a Gothic nave and choir designed in the 14th century; the portal of red stone was created by Giovanni Betto in the beginning of the 18th century. A cloister, begun in the 14th century but never finished, contains a stone pulpit, and connects with the Petite-Eglise or Notre-Dame-de-Galilée, a well-preserved specimen of Romanesque architecture of the 12th century. All of the monuments were restored or rebuilt in the same manner after 1950.

Since 1880, the Council House&quot;Mairie&quot; has held a marvelous theater, a library with some old and valuable manuscripts, a reading hall and a museum of rocks and antiquities collected by the members of the Vosges Philomatic Society. This society, which engaged in the collection and diffusion of knowledge, was founded in 1875 by Henry Bardy, who was soon an editor of the first local republican paper named &quot;La Gazette Vosgiennne&quot;. All this center of town was destroyed in November 1944.

After 1948, a new hôtel-de-ville was built to the west. At its west side there is now a monument by Merci to Jules Ferry, long ago in an old union place under the cathedral. Born in the town in 1832, Jules Ferry was a great French politician of the conservative Republic, constitutionally called Third Republic in 1875.

After World War II, the right side of the Meurthe was completely razed and most people lived outside the town in wood cabins for decades. The radical plan created by Le Corbusier in 1945, which called for a large plaza with factories and other buildings in the heart of the city, was rejected in 1947, and only one private factory belonging to Jean-Jacques Duval was ever built. There were no means nor materials in this terrible period and the great street called &quot;rue Thiers&quot; was finished only at the end of 1954.

==Economy==
The town was industrial in nature long before the local economy reaped the benefits from a migration of Alsatians, who arrived after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. Its industries included the spinning, weaving and bleaching of cotton, wire-drawing, metal-founding, the manufacture of hosiery, woodwork of various kinds (toleware), machinery, iron goods and wire screen. Since the world wars, major industrial activities have declined precipitously. Now the town is primarily a center of public services, educational institutions, a hospital, and businesses in the service industries, such as supermarkets.

==History==
Saint-Dié (Lat. &quot;Deodatum, Theodata, S. Deodati Fanum&quot;) is named for Saint Deodat. A holy man who was known as &quot;le bonhomme&quot;, he founded a &quot;ban&quot; (a political and Christian subdivision of the royal territory) in the 7th century that was originally called Foresta. Some religious historians believed he was the bishop of Nevers, Deodatus of Nevers. Deodatus gave up his official functions to retire to a desert dwelling. Other sources connect the name, however, with an earlier saint, Deodatus of Blois (d. 525).

Archeological and historical records confirm the total time that this area has been inhabited. One hypothesis holds that a column constructed by Romans on a site originally dedicated to Tiwaz – Tius, god of war – might explain ancient ceremonies in the old Saint-Dié chapel at the foot of Kemberg mountain (locally called Saint-Martin). Deodatus, who could have been an &quot;episcopus hiberniensis&quot; (bishop from Ireland) or an &quot;episcopus niverniensis&quot; (bishop from Nevers), would have lived in an old monastery or &quot;vieux moutier&quot; above the old chapel and a water source.

Legends originating in the 11th century as well as popular traditions say that Saint Deodatus himself dreamed of a new monastery to be built upon a little hill called &quot; la monticule des Jointures&quot;, visible on the other side of the river. A little monastic community dedicated to Saint Maurice was probably founded during Carolingian times, as there is evidence of its presence there since the 10th century. After 1006, the monastery took the name Saint-Dié. The little monastery was partially destroyed by fire in 1065 and again in 1155.

The date on which the site became a chapter of canons is uncertain. Historians deny that Brunon de Dabo-Egisheim, future Pope Leo IX, was a young monk and great provost here, but his family did play a great role in the elevated status of this religious place, giving their coat of arms to it after the First Crusades. Canons who subsequently held the rank of provost or dean came from very rich and noble families, among them Giovanni de Medici and several princes of the ducal House of Lorraine. Among the extensive privileges enjoyed by them was the coining of money; the Duchy of Lorraine was the last to hold this privilege, in 1601.

Though they co-operated in building the town walls in 1290, the canons and the dukes of Lorraine soon became rivals for the authority over Saint-Dié. The institution of a town council in 1628 which appropriated part of their temporal jurisdiction, in addition to numerous French occupations, diminished the financial influence of the canons. During the Stanislas reign and after the Lorraine annexation in 1776, the establishment in 1777 of a bishopric condemned the venerable institution, with the first bishop Monseigneur de Chaumont. With the French Revolution all the religious people were completely swept away.

The town was repeatedly sacked during the wars of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The little but religiously very prestigious town was partially destroyed by fire in 1554 and 1757. Funds for the rebuilding of the portion of the town destroyed by the last fire were supplied by Stanislas, last duke of Lorraine.

The Musée Pierre-Noël was built in 1977 and originally showcased life in the High Vosges, but the collections now also prominently feature contemporary art.

==Ecclesiastical history==

The diocese of Saint-Dié was created in 1777, but suppressed by the Concordat of 1801. It was restored in 1822 as a suffragan of the Diocese of Besançon covering the department of the Vosges, of which 18 parishes were transferred to the Diocese of Strasbourg in 1871.

The diocese of Saint-Dié originated in the celebrated abbey, initially named &quot;Galilée&quot;, and was established by Saint Deodatus (Dié) in the 7th century, around which the town of Saint-Dié grew up. The Benedictines of the original foundation Saint Maurice were replaced in 996 by Augustinian Canons.

During the sixteenth century, and the long vacancy of the see of Toul, the abbots of the several monasteries in the Vosges, without actually declaring themselves independent of the diocese of Toul, claimed to exercise a quasi-episcopal jurisdiction. In 1718, the Bishop of Toul requested the creation of a see at Saint-Dié, but the suggestion was opposed by the King of France. The see was eventually created by Pope Pius VI in 1777 by the elevation of the abbey of Saint-Dié into a bishopric. The new diocese was removed from the diocese of Toul and made instead a suffragan of the German Archdiocese of Trier.

The Reformed Church building in Saint-Dié contains six stained windows, depicting the first six days of Creation, designed by the Swiss artist Annie Vallotton, whose brother was the minister there.

==Cosmography==

Vautrin Lud, Canon of St-Dié in charge of the mines of the valleys was the chaplain and secretary of René II, Duke of Lorraine. He set up a printing-establishment at St-Dié and facilitated reflections on the theme of Earth representation and also met with what would today be called geographers, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, and the Alsatian professor Matthias Ringmann and clever Canons.

The team began at once to produce an edition of a Latin translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. In 1507, René II received the Soderini Letter from Lisbon, an abridged account of the four voyages of Amerigo Vespucci. Canon Lud had this translated into Latin by Basin de Sandaucourt. The translation dedicated to the Emperor Maximilian was completed at St-Dié on 24 April 1507; it was prefaced by a short explanatory booklet, entitled &quot;Cosmographiae Introductio&quot;, certainly the work of Waldseemüller, an introduction to cosmography that can be seen as the baptismal certificate of the New Continent. Indeed, Waldseemüller and the scholars of the Gymnasium Vosagense then made a capital decision writing: &quot;...And since Europe and Asia received names of women, I do not see any reason not to call this latest discovery Amerige, or America, according to the sagacious man who discovered it&quot;.

The first and second printings appeared in August 1507 at St-Dié, a third at Strassburg in 1509, and thus the name of America was spread about. Thus, Saint-Dié-des-Vosges is honored today with the title of &quot;godmother of America&quot;, the city that named America. The work was re-edited with an English version by Charles Herbermann (New York, 1907). Gallois proved that in 1507, Waldseemüller inserted this name in two maps, but that in 1513, in other maps Waldseemüller, being better informed, inserted the name of Columbus as the discoverer of America. But it was too late; the name of America had been already firmly established.

In 1507, Martin Waldseemüller produced in St-Dié also a world globe bearing the first use of the name &quot;America&quot;.

<text>Mark Einar Johnson (born September 22, 1957) is an American ice hockey coach for the University of Wisconsin–Madison women&#x27;s ice hockey team. He is a former National Hockey League (NHL) player who appeared in 669 NHL regular season games between 1980 and 1990. He also played for the gold medal-winning 1980 U.S. Olympic team, leading the team in points with 11. As head coach of Wisconsin, he has led them to seven NCAA Division I National Championships, the most for all NCAA Division I hockey teams (men or women&#x27;s teams).

Johnson was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1999, the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001, the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003, and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004. He received the Lester Patrick Trophy in 2011, for outstanding service to hockey in the United States.

==Playing career==

===Amateur career===
As a teenager, Johnson attended James Madison Memorial High School in Madison, Wisconsin, where he was on the hockey team. He then played for the University of Wisconsin–Madison ice hockey team for three years under his father, legendary coach Bob Johnson. In 1977, during his first year at the university, he helped the Badgers win the NCAA national championship. He was the first Badger to win the WCHA Rookie of the year. He went on to become the school&#x27;s leading goal scorer and second all-time scorer. Johnson was also a two time All-American. His younger brother, Peter, also played at the university.

===International and professional career===
Johnson made his international debut with the United States national team as an 18-year-old in 1976, when he played in 11 training games for the 1976 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team coached by his father. He represented the United States in 13 international tournaments (including the 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1990 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments and the 1981, 1984 and 1987 Canada Cup). He was a star player on the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; U.S. Olympic Hockey team at the 1980 Lake Placid winter games.

Playing for the United States against the Soviet Union, Johnson scored two of the four goals in the Team USA 4–3 victory. His first goal, scored with one second left in the game&#x27;s first period, led to the Soviet coach taking out his goalie, Vladislav Tretiak, who was considered the best goalie in the world at the time; years later, when Johnson asked Soviet defenseman Slava Fetisov, now an NHL teammate, about the decision, he was simply told, &quot;Coach crazy&quot;. He also scored in the third period to tie the game at 3–3. The team then defeated Finland to capture the gold medal, with Johnson assisting on the game-winning goal and scoring the insurance goal with less than four minutes remaining in the game. Johnson was named team MVP.

Johnson went on to play professional hockey in the NHL for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Minnesota North Stars, Hartford Whalers, St. Louis Blues, and New Jersey Devils. He played in the 1984 NHL All Star game as the Whalers representative and served as the Whalers&#x27; captain in 1983–85. He also played two seasons with Milan Saima SG in Italy and a final season in Austria before retiring in 1992. He briefly came out of retirement to play two games for Team USA in the 1998 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships qualifying tournament at the age of 41, where he helped Team USA retain its position in the World Championships&#x27; Pool A.

In 2010, thirty years after winning the Olympic gold medal as a player, Johnson coached the United States women&#x27;s national ice hockey team, which won a silver medal in the Vancouver games.

On February 9, 2019, the University of Wisconsin retired #10 during a pre-game presentation at the Kohl Center. Johnson was the first player to have his number retired.

==Personal life==
Johnson has completed a B.A. degree in kinesiology at the University of Wisconsin in 1994. Johnson&#x27;s son, Patrick Johnson, played for the men&#x27;s hockey team at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He coaches his daughter, Mikayla, who plays for the women&#x27;s hockey team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His other son, Chris Johnson, played for the men&#x27;s hockey team at Augsburg College, and now serves as an assistant coach on the Augsburg men&#x27;s ice hockey team. His other daughter, Megan, also plays hockey for the women&#x27;s team at Augsburg College.

Michael Cummings played Johnson in the 1981 TV movie &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;. Eric Peter-Kaiser portrayed him in the 2004 Disney film &quot;Miracle&quot;. Peter-Kaiser was playing college ice hockey for SUNY Potsdam when he got the part.

<doc id="1138777" wikidata="Q6664" url="?curid=1138777" title="AC Cesena">
<text>AC Cesena, commonly referred to as Cesena (), was an Italian football club based in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna. The club spent most of its history in professional leagues such as Serie A and Serie B, but went bankrupt and folded in 2018. Another club from Cesena, A.S.D. Romagna Centro Cesena, claims to be the bankrupted club&#x27;s successor and in 2019 changed its name to &quot;Cesena F.C.&quot;.

The club was formed in 1940 and won its first promotion to Serie A in 1973. Since then, the club have been in Serie A for a total of 13 seasons, their best achievement coming in 1976 with a sixth-placed finish and a short run in the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup. The other four promotions to Serie A were achieved in 1981, 1987, 2010 (after two consecutive promotions — from the third league (Lega Pro) in 2009 and from Serie B in 2010, both won on the final day of the season) and 2014.

==History==
Founded in 1940, Cesena reached Serie B in 1968 and were promoted to Serie A for the first time in 1973. With players such as Pierluigi Cera and Gianluigi Savoldi, the club held its own and finished a respectable 11th place in their debut season, repeating that finish the following year. In the 1975–76 season, Cesena surprised Italy by finishing sixth and subsequently qualifying for the UEFA Cup. The glory was short-lived and they would be relegated the next year.

A second promotion to Serie A followed in 1981 and finished a respectable 10th before being relegated once more in 1983, staying in Serie B for four years. After winning a play-off, they were back in Serie A for 1987–88 and enjoyed a four-year stay, being obdurate enough to just avoid relegation in this time.

After relegation in 1991, Cesena had another chance to return to Serie A in 1994. With players such as Alessandro Teodorani, Emiliano Salvetti, Luigi Piangerelli, Aldo Dolcetti, and Dario Hübner, this was a team of considerable ability. They finished level on points with Padova, however, and lost a promotion play-off which would be a bitter blow for the club, who would suffer relegation to Serie C1 in 1997. Whilst promotion followed, a relegation play-off against Pistoiese in 2000 would see them condemned to a four-year stay in the third division.

In the 2005–06 Serie B, Cesena surprisingly emerged as contenders for promotion to Serie A, ending in sixth place and being therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs. They escaped relegation the following season, but not in 2007–08.

Cesena&#x27;s first campaign in Serie C1, now rebranded Lega Pro Prima Divisione, started with former Foligno boss Pierpaolo Bisoli as new head coach. Throughout the season, Cesena quickly emerged as major contenders for direct promotion, and managed to take first place in the league on Week 33, with only one game remaining and a two-point advantage to challengers Pro Patria. On the final week of the season, Cesena&#x27;s 0–0 draw with Verona, coupled with Pro Patria&#x27;s 0–0 draw with Padova, gave the &quot;bianconeri&quot; the league title and direct promotion back to Serie B, after only one season in the Italian third tier. Cesena went to as 3rd in Round 33, one point behind Brescia in the 2009–10 season. Cesena earned their second consecutive promotion after a 1–0 victory at Piacenza and Brescia&#x27;s 2–1 loss in Padua against Padova on 30 May 2010, finishing 19 years of absence from the Serie A.

===Serie A and B===
Cesena returned to Serie A after 19 years of absence in 2010. After the 2011–12 season, Cesena were relegated from the top tier to the Serie B.

Since relegation Cesena also restructured their finance, which the company revered merger with intermediate holding company Cesena 1940 Srl in December 2012. The company held 98.23% shares of AC Cesena SpA. After the merger, another intermediate holding company, Opera Cesena Calcio Srl represented by Igor Campedelli (from unknown investor through Romagna Sport Srl), which previously own 65.03% shares on Cesena 1940 Srl, sold 27.6% shares of Cesena to GMG Srl, a company of Giorgio Lugaresi, who already owned 30.06% shares of Cesena 1940 Srl before the merger. On 24 April 2013 Giorgio Lugaresi was re-elected as the president of A.C. Cesena SpA. After the transactions the club also recapitalized €9.5 million during 2013–14 season in order to avoid bankruptcy, which GMG Srl through subsidiary Cesena &amp; Co. Scarl, held 9,499,000 out of 9,500,000 shares (99.9895%) of Cesena as of 30 June 2014, with a nominal value of €1 per shares. In February 2014 Cesena was under criminal investigation for the fraud in Campedelli era. Campedelli was banned 6 months in March 2013 by FIGC.

Despite the financial difficulties, Cesena won promotion back to Serie A on 18 June 2014, winning Latina in playoffs in 4–2 aggregate. In that match, most of the players (12 out of 20) were on loan from other clubs, with only 4 players were under Cesena contract in starting lineup (Renzetti, De Feudis, Garritano and Defrel) and 4 players on the bench (Alberto Iglio, Consolini, Rodríguez and Succi). Financially, Cesena had another year of negative EBITDA in 2013–14 season, for about €11 million, if excluding windfall profit from player trading from the calculation.

In September 2016, the club and former chairman Campedelli were also sued by the prosecutor for false accounting in player-swap (Fabbri–Palumbo as well as Nagatomo–Caldirola–Garritano) Eventually the directors were inadmissible from the charge due to expiry of the legal proceeding but the club chose to plead guilty for a fine of €80,000.

In June 2018, Cesena was charged for false accounting again in the player swap with Chievo. The prosecutor request to penalize Cesena for up to 15 points, accusing the price tag in the deals were inflated. However, as Cesena was folded in 2018, the club was not penalized. An appeal to a department of Italian National Olympic Committee, stating the point deduction should be applied to 2017–18 season, causing Virtus Entella, which originally relegated in 2017–18 Serie B season, made another appeal to Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio, for re-admission back to 2018–19 Serie B.

On 16 July 2018 Cesena declared bankruptcy and were banned from participating in 2018–19 Serie B.

==Phoenix club==
In July 2018 A.S.D. Romagna Centro, or known as Romagna Centro, applied to rename as &quot;Cesena F.C.&quot;, as a phoenix club of A.C. Cesena.

<text>Carriers&#x27; Dock (or North Carriers&#x27; Dock) was a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. The dock was situated in the northern dock system and connected to Brocklebank Dock to the west.

==History==
The dock was originally the northern of a pair of docks joining Brocklebank Dock, known as North Carriers&#x27; Dock and South Carriers&#x27; Dock. The docks were each wide at the entrance, and were intended for use by river goods carriers.

North Carriers&#x27; Dock was opened in 1862, with a basin covering , and with a total quayside of . South Carriers&#x27; Dock had a basin covering , and with a total quayside of .

The site of South Carriers&#x27; Dock was used for a graving dock in 1898.

From 15 May 1968 until 30 September 1972, the northern quayside of Carriers&#x27; Dock was used as a temporary terminal for the B&amp;I Line, prior to the company using Trafalgar Dock, and for MD&amp;HB cargo handling around the same time. The southern quayside of Carriers&#x27; Dock was a rough cargo berth.

North Carriers&#x27; Dock was filled in the late 20th century, and the site has been redeveloped.

<text>S.D. Curlee is a guitar manufacturer originating in Matteson, Illinois and presently in central Texas. Peak years were 1977 to 1981 before ceasing production until 2011. For a while its electric basses were popular, much more so than their guitars. They were exported and especially popular in Ecuador &amp; Belgium Malaysia currents spotted and Germany during the original run.

== History ==
This company founded by musician/businessman Randy Curlee, instrument designer Randy Dritz and pattern maker Sonny Storbeck in 1975 in Matteson, IL. The name S.D Curlee came from the three original partners: Storbeck, Dritz and Curlee. Production began in early 1976 and ceased in 1982.

Officially, the company manufactured around 15,000 instruments, though this is disputed amongst the company founders. Curlee wanted to offer a quality-built instrument at an affordable price. Advertising campaigns were focused on Guitar Player. An classy 8-page color brochure from 1979 was produced along with multiple color ads originally placed in the magazine.

During these years, the Curlee brand was applied to Curlee-arranged import versions and was also licensed to Hondo. S.D. Curlee was one of the first instrument manufacturers to use this approach to address the issue of unlicensed copies of premium brands. Other instrument companies subsequently followed its lead, such as Fender&#x27;s Squier brand of Asian-manufactured products and Gibson&#x27;s use of its Epiphone brand. This business model has become a standard both to gain a share in the copy market and also provide customers with a more budget-oriented version of a higher-priced instrument.

During the early 1980s the climate for these &#x27;all natural&#x27; instruments changed drastically. Headless designs, flashy colors and an altogether different approach inspired Curlee to branch out and offer flashy, painted guitars reminiscent of the original version. Combined with a recession and internal business decisions, the company ceased operations in 1982. Curlee&#x27;s innovative designs inspired a cult following that remains active today.

Randy Curlee continued in sales and marketing in the musical instrument industry, including work for Yamaha as the manager of the DGA (Drums, Guitars &amp; Amps) Division and Peavey Guitars. He died in 2005 from complications of diabetes.

== Construction ==

The Curlee instruments featured a unique design blend of neck through body and a bolt-on neck, which was anchored in the body with a heavy brass plate.

Most of the 1970s bass models shared the same basic, almost symmetrical shape (inspired by the Gibson Les Paul Jr. double cutaway), and were available in fretted and fretless versions. The main models were:

* Standard 1 (1 P-bass DiMarzio, mahogany body, maple neck, originally equipped with a Gibson EB-like humbucker, the DiMarzio Model One, located near the bridge)
* Standard 2 (identical to the above but 2 pick ups - P pickup-era only)
* Butcher (body made of butcher block maple)
* Liberty (liberty bell shaped body designed by Denny Rauen)
* Curbeck (body made of walnut, maple stripes)
* Summit (body and neck made of laminated walnut and Maple)
* Yankee (active electronics, walnut body, maple neck, small upper horn/lower bout, ...sort of an &#x27;updated&#x27;version of the Curbeck ) - released in the early 1980s. The Yankee was advertised with three different pick up configurations; 1 P-bass (Yankee I), 2-Pbass (Yankee II) and the rare Yankee II-J including 1 P-bass (bridge)/J-bass (neck). Most Yankees have a 2 p-bass pick-up set up (Yankee II).

Other models and body shapes were prototyped and saw limited production. Some late &quot;Curlee&quot; instruments (late in the original run the brand as applied had been modified, removing the S and D) had painted bodies and set (glued in) necks. A P-bass bodied version was produced along with pointy &quot;Star&quot; model basses &amp; guitars, all in very limited batches.

S.D. Curlees feature hardware including Grover tuning heads; brass, Badass II or original Badass bridges; a brass nut and high output DiMarzio pickups. All basses used a 32½&quot; medium scale neck. Some of the original USA basses developed truss rod issues over time. Later models introduced a German Carve body edge and aluminum instead of brass plates.

== Cultural effect and availability ==
Although the brand enjoys a cult-like status, only a few famous bass guitarists were seen with Curlee models in the mid- to late-1970s. Former Mahavishnu Orchestra bass guitarist Rick Laird had one, R. &quot;Skeet&quot; Curtis played one (and still has it) while touring with Parliament, Vincent Gallo used one in the New York City noise band Gray and Nick Lowe used a Curlee fretless on a few assignments. Jack Blades used them on the first Night Ranger album and played one on the &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me you love me&quot; video. Alec John Such (Bon Jovi) was known to have three. Recently, guitarist Adam McIlwee of Tigers Jaw can be seen using a vintage Curlee guitar. Brandt Huseman of The Greenberry Woods, plays a vintage international Standard 1 bass. Duran Duran bass player John Taylor posted the 1980 bill for his Hondo Curlee bass on the Duran Duran website.

On July 4, 2011, Scott Beckwith, owner of Birdsong Guitars, announced the resurrection of the SD Curlee instruments. The new basses are visually close to the originals but with modern hardware and upgrades. Current production is of USA basses only and is under 25 per year.

<doc id="1138787" wikidata="Q1051573" url="?curid=1138787" title="Vehicle registration plates of Romania">
<text>The most common format for [[vehicle registration plate]]s in Romania consists of black letters on white background in the format codice_1, where codice_2 is a two letter county code, codice_3 is a two digit group, and codice_4 is a three letter group. For Bucharest, the format is codice_5 or codice_6, where codice_7 is code for Bucharest city, codice_3 and codice_9 is a two or three digit group, and codice_4 is a three letter group.
The left side of the plate bears a blue vertical strip (the &quot;Euroband&quot;) displaying the 12 stars of the European Union and the country code of Romania (RO). Between 1992 and 2007 the band featured the Romanian flag instead of the 12 stars. All lettering comes from the Latin alphabet.

The front plate usually carries a round label displaying the month and year when the technical inspection of the vehicle is due. These labels have different background colors depending on the year displayed. The label does not have a specific slot and can be placed anywhere, but the right side is preferred and plates usually come with a slot for them.

==Regulations==

License plates are mandatory on both the front and rear of vehicles (only on the rear for motorcycles).

It is mandatory for the paint on all plates to be reflective, and they must be kept clean and fully visible at all times.

===Assignment rules===

The plates are issued for each car and for each owner, and they must be returned when the car is either sold or scrapped, although the new buyer is entitled to request continued use of the old license plate.

The digits and letters for the standard license plates are usually assigned at random, unless a customization fee is paid. Customizing is limited to picking the digits and the 3 capital letters at the end, provided the chosen combination is not already assigned.

The letter codice_11 is not used as it may be confused with the letter codice_12. The three-letter code may not start with codice_13 or codice_12, as they can be mistaken for codice_15 or codice_16. (Until 1999, codice_13 and codice_12 were not used at all). Also, combinations like codice_19 or codice_20 are not allowed.

Several letter groups have been reserved for special use and may not be assigned to regular cars. These include codice_21 (Romanian Police), codice_22 (Chamber of Deputies), codice_23 (Romanian Senate), codice_24 (Romanian Intelligence Service), codice_25 (Romanian Government).

It is common for companies or organizations with large car fleets to use the same letter combination on all their cars. Such combinations are done only as a convenience; they are not reserved, are assigned only while numbers last, and can additionally be explicitly requested by anybody, regardless of affiliation to that company or organization.

Letter combinations that may form obscene words in the Romanian language are denied licensing, but may still be in use if they were issued before the combination was blocked.

Combinations which the public has consistently refused to use, such as codice_26 (clunker, wreck of a car) or codice_27 (insult with the meaning of &quot;dumb&quot;) are not included in the random assignment pool, but may still be explicitly requested.

===Size and font===

There are three standard sizes for license plates:

* A (520 x 110 mm) is the most widely used type and is mandatory for the front on any type of car.
* B (340 x 200 mm) is a narrow type used on the back of certain types of cars, such as SUVs.
* C (240 x 130 mm) is used exclusively by motorcycles.

The font used for the main part of the plate is DIN 1451 Mittelschrift, while the RO country code on the Euroband uses DIN 1451 Engschrift.

===Legislation===

In Romania, vehicle license plates are issued based on:

* Article 19 from O.U.G. 195 from 12 December 2002 regarding traffic on public roads
* Order of Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration nr. 1501 from 13 November 2006, regarding the procedure of vehicle licensing, registering, striking out and issuing of provisional or running licenses.
* Romanian Standard SR 13078:1996 &quot;Road vehicles. Retro-reflective registration plates for motor vehicles and trailers&quot; with five updates.
* Romanian Standard SR 13140:1996 &quot;Road vehicles. Content and structure of registration provisional and running test numbers to be relief embossed on retro-reflective registration plates&quot; with three updates.

==Possible combinations==

Given that codice_11 cannot be used at all, and that all letter combinations starting with codice_12 or codice_13 are forbidden in order to avoid confusion, there are roughly 23 x 25 x 25 = 14,375 letter combinations (but keep in mind that a couple of dozen specific combinations have been eliminated from the public pool for various reasons). Multiplying with the 99 numbers in the original scheme (codice_31 is not a valid number) gives 1,423,125 possible combination for each of the 42 counties.

While the total 59,771,250 number of combinations is far in excess (about an order of magnitude greater) than the actual number of vehicles registered in the entirety of Romania, this does not take into account the particularities of specific counties.

Indeed, during 2010 it was estimated that the pool of combinations for Bucharest would run out during the year, a situation created by the city&#x27;s unusually large vehicle pool when compared to other cities and even entire counties.

This has led to expanding the number code for Bucharest to 3 digits, raising the city&#x27;s pool to 2,860,625 and the total number of combinations overall to 61,208,750.

==Other license plate formats==
There are several other types of license plates currently in use in Romania in addition to the standard format.

===Short-term temporary plates===
Colloquially referred to as red numbers, the short-term temporary plates consist of the European strip, followed by the county code and three to six digits, of which the first is always zero and the second is always non-zero. All the writing outside of the European-strip on this plate is in red font.

These plates are valid for a maximum of 30 days and they can be re-issued for a cumulative continuous period of no more than 90 days.

These plates can be used for any vehicle regardless of its technical road-worthy state and have been specially designed as a fallback for any case where it would be impractical or impossible for a vehicle to be issued regular plates.

They tend to be most often used by car leasing and rental companies for their new cars, or cars used as temporary replacement while the owner&#x27;s car is being repaired.

There is a variation of this format used for test vehicles, having 3 digits following the county code, and the inscription &quot;PROBE&quot; (trials) after the digits. The smallest number used in this case is 101.

===Long-term temporary plates===
The long-term temporary plates are similar to the short-term plates but use a black inscription instead of red and the number never starts with zero. Additionally, on the right side there is a red strip containing the end date of the plate&#x27;s validity in YY/MM format.

This kind of plate is used most often for foreign nationals who take temporary residence in Romania, and for cars that fall under a leasing agreement.

===Plates for electric vehicles===
Most commonly known as &quot;green plates&quot;, they are similar to the standard format, but use a green inscription instead of black. This kind of plate is meant solely for electric vehicles (EVs), distinguishing them from those vehicles relying on gasoline or diesel.

===Diplomatic plates===

The diplomatic plate contains the European strip followed by blue text. The text consists of a code which can be codice_32 (Diplomatic Corps), codice_33 (Consular Transport), or codice_34 (Consulate), followed by 6 digits.

The first three digits stand for the country or international organization, the last three usually for the rank of the owner. The lowest number for both sets of 3 is 101. Thus, a car with license plate number codice_35 would refer to Switzerland&#x27;s (codice_9) ambassador (ambassadors and heads of mission are usually assigned code codice_37).

CD license plates are issued exclusively to diplomats, and cars having such plates benefit from diplomatic immunity. However TC licence plates are issued to foreign NATO officers based in Romania and other organisations in addition to Consulates. Initially, the countries or organizations received codes in their alphabetical order, but some countries, such as United States or Russia, have received more than one code because they have surpassed 899 registered cars.

Table of codes (incomplete):

===Plates for special organizations===

The Romanian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are allowed to issue plates in a special format which does not fall under normal regulations.

The format, size and style is decided by each such organization via internal regulations and may not resemble other types of plates.

The Armed Forces use plates without the European strip (as their regulations predate the 1992 regulation imposing it), with the letter &quot;A&quot; (&quot;Armată&quot;, military) followed by 3 to 7 digits. Military plates issued more recently (from 2002 onwards) may include the European strip.

Ministry of Interior plates start with &quot;MAI&quot; and are typically seen on cars belonging to the Gendarmerie, Romanian Police, emergency response units, and some SMURD ambulances.

MAI plates are not issued to cars used by local police employed by town hall, which use regular plates instead.

===Local administration plates===


Yellow background plates are issued by the local authorities such as town hall, municipalities, village or commune mayoralties for the registration of certain light vehicles, or other types of vehicles that do not need country-wide authorization, such as public utility vehicles, some light garbage trucks, lawn mowers, small sanitation vehicles, mass-transit vehicles tethered to local infrastructure, quad bikes, scooters, golf carts and non-road going agricultural vehicles, such as combine harvesters, non-road-going tractors, or horse-drawn carts.

The format of the plate is not standardized across all administrations. Most local authorities used a yellow plate, but there are exceptions like Cluj-Napoca, which used white plate similar to old German plates, but always bearing the letters CJ-N (from the city name&#x27;s abbreviation), followed by 3 digits.

The coat of arms or initials of the city or village is often used on the left, followed by a number of fixed-length number (4 to 6 digits, always the same size within the same issuing authority). The first number to be issued is usually 1, zero-padded to the left.

Vehicles bearing yellow plates may not leave the jurisdiction of the authority that issued the plate, but some of them can cross county borders on occasion, for example rental scooters, vehicles being towed, or trolleybuses on their way from the factory to the depot. In the case of rental vehicles such as scooters or quad bikes, they tend to retain the registration plates issued by the authority of the region where the owner resides even when they are used in another jurisdiction.

Dual-powered buses are registered with standard number plates.

Trams may not bear the plate itself, but are required to somehow bear the registration number, either painted or printed on a sticker, usually next to their fleet number.

==County codes==

This is the table of counties, their county code and their county capital cities.

==History==

=== 1900–1908 ===
The first plate was issued in 1900 to Bazil Assan, bearing the number 1. This created a problem with Prince Bibescu, who wanted to have the first license plate, so he was issued plate number 0 (zero). Bibescu&#x27;s car can be seen today at the National Museum of Romanian History.

The plates took the simple form of white numbers on a black background, and were home made. The numbers belonged to the owner and not the car, and the list of owners and their numbers was published monthly in the &quot;Revista Automobilă&quot; magazine, edited by the Romanian Royal Automobile club. As there were so few cars (139 in 1908), it was not necessary to note the region on the number plate. Registration was done by the Mayor of Bucharest.

The published lists show that the numbers were assigned in the order they were requested, without differentiating between physical persons and organizations.

=== 1908–1966 ===


On August 15, 1908, a letter sent by the Romanian Automobile Club to the Chief Commissioner of Police mentions the need for a new system of license plates, which would see that all plates use the same size and font and include the name of the city where the vehicle was registered. The new system was approved by the police very soon after and a car participating to a race on October 26, 1908 can already be seen bearing the number &quot;9-Bc&quot; (Bucharest).

As the new system became more and more common-place, the county was usually indicated by adding a hyphen and the regional abbreviation, which was derived from the main letters of the county capital. Ilfov County, for example, was represented by &quot;B&quot; for Bucharest (&quot;Bc&quot; before 1914), while Craiova, &quot;Cv&quot;, represented Dolj.

Some period photos of, for example, Lugoj show the abbreviation &quot;Lgs&quot; appearing both before and after the number, although by the 1930s the number invariably came first.

Plates tended to be white on a black background until the late 1920s, when the system gradually moved to black on a white background.

This system was in place until 1966. The frequent territorial and administrative changes of the period meant that the codes changed often, and after December 1960 they started being based on the region&#x27;s name rather than the name of the main regional city. So, after 1960 a car registered in Craiova as &quot;150-Cv&quot; would have changed its license plate to &quot;150-OL&quot;, corresponding to the new administrative region Oltenia. Similarly, when Brașov changed its name to &quot;Orașul Stalin&quot; in 1952, the regional code was also changed to &quot;O.S.&quot;, before reverting to &quot;Br&quot; briefly and then &quot;BV&quot; after the changes of December 1960.

Special numbers were used occasionally to denote the type of vehicles they were on. For a while in the 1930s, in Bucharest, numbers between 10,000-B and 12,999-B (the comma was used as thousands separator) were taxis; they carried &quot;Tx&quot; as an additional tag, as did buses, which started with 15,000-B. Around 1952, commercial vehicles began to be given numbers over 25,101, specialised commercial vehicles and buses numbers over 50,101, tractors over 65,101 and motorcycles over 75,101. Around 1959, to create a distinction between state-owned and privately owned cars, the latter were given numbers beginning with 5,001 in the provinces and 15,001 in Bucharest. By 1966, when the system was changed, the numbers for cars allocated to Bucharest were all taken and a new system was needed. 

In the pre-war period 0 was the smallest number possible (although in practice most counties started counting at 1). After 1952 numbers started with 101, possibly influenced by the Soviet system, where they started with 01-01.

Pre-war county codes (1913)

Interwar-period county codes:

===1966–1993===
By the 1960s all regional codes were two letters long and capitalised. In 1966 the license plate system was completely overhauled. The new plates were issued in the format :
*The numbers in front (aa) were arranged as follows:
**1 to 19 – automobiles, since 1990 all private vehicles, regardless of type
**20 – reserved for automobiles, but never used
**21 to 30 – freight transport vehicles, including lorry tractor units; also buses, if modified for freight transport
**31 to 40 – buses, coaches and utility vehicles
**41 to 45 – road tractors
**46 to 50 – motorcycles.
*The letters (BB) denoted the administrative regions until 1968, and after that counties (&quot;județe&quot;). Following the 1968 reorganisation of Romania&#x27;s counties, new codes were introduced. These represented generally the same counties as the ones used today (see the county codes). However, between 1966 and 1968, some old codes were used. Thus, a registration plate for Ploiesti region would be 1-PL-1234, which would have changed after 1968 to 1-PH-1234 (for Prahova). Many codes, however, did not need to change: Bucharest (B) and Cluj (CJ), for example, remained the same.
*The numbers after the county abbreviation () were in groups of either three, four or five digits, and were issued in ascending order, starting from 101. The old plates were declared invalid. 101 as the first number may have come from the Soviet-style &quot;first number&quot; 01-01.
*Numbers with 5 digits after the county code were issued only in Bucharest. It started with 1-B-10000 to 1-B-99999, then 2-B-10000 to 59999, until the change of the system. 9-B-10001 to 9-B-39999 were issued, between the early 1980s and 1992, for Ilfov (or the Ilfov Agricultural Sector). Up until the 1980s Ilfov plates were registered IF, an abbreviation which would return in 2005.

1960-1968 region codes

An interesting development was the connection between the license plate and the social status of the car owner. For example, the &quot;important&quot; cars (i.e. those belonging to the nomenklatura) generally used 1, then the county, then three digits. Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s ARO sported the &quot;1-B-111&quot; license plate. By the mid-1970s, any plate with three digits was considered important (regardless of the number at the front), and although older cars had been initially issued with three-digit combinations, many owners were &quot;asked&quot; by the authorities to change their numbers. In an age where most people had the same car - the Dacia - such distinguishing features were considered important. By the 1980s, in Bucharest 1-B with 3 or 4 digits and 2-B and 3-B with three digits were also considered important numbers. Furthermore, the legend that the three-digit formula, where the middle number was the sum of the other two numbers, signified real importance sprang up. Thus, many senior Communist leaders had numbers such as 1-B-363, while the Neamț County party secretary had 1-NT-165 on his black Volga.

From circa 1977 foreign citizens and organizations were issued plates with 12-B (12-xx in other counties). 14-B was used for rental cars, but since 1990 some official cars had such number plates too.

There were also some stylistic variations. Numbers on a yellow (rather than white) background were state property, but since all trucks, buses and other heavy vehicles were state property, those with yellow background plates belonged to ministries or other special state organizations. Numbers with white letters on a black background were issued to vehicles of the foreign organizations in Romania, but also to vehicles belonging to religious organizations.

Temporary plates had the county code and then a number beginning with 0; test drive plates had a number beginning with 0 and then the county - occasionally with &quot;Probe&quot; written on them too.

In late 1977 the manufacture of plates was standardized and they were all made on a pressed steel rectangle; previously plates had been plastic, cast iron, enamel, porcelain or even plaster. In around 1982, after 19-B-9999 had been reached, it was decided to begin the series 1-B with five digits. In 1983, after a brief reorganization of the counties, IF (Ilfov County) was dropped, CL (Călărași County) and GR (Giurgiu County) were introduced, and the Bucharest Agricultural Sector (&quot;Sectorul Agricol Ilfov&quot;) issued plates beginning with 9-B and followed by five digits. The fonts used on the number plates changed slightly in 1988.

=== 1992–2007===
The modern plate style was changed in 1992, when new reflective plates were introduced, with the numbering system still in use today. Initially, these plates were issued in very small numbers for official vehicles, and most other vehicles still had plates issued under the old system, until the end of May 1993. The old plates remained valid until 2000.

On plates issued before January 1, 2007 the flag of Romania was used instead of the 12 European stars.

The new plate design fell in line with modern requirements, allowed far more combinations while simultaneously being simpler to read and remember, mandated the use of reflective plates thus contributing to road safety, and minimized the additional changes required for when Romania would join the European Union.

==Special plates==

===Historical military plates===
The license plates before around 1945 were white and had a number beginning with a zero. In front of the number was the initial of the Ministry of Defense State Undersecretaries:
* U for the Ground Forces (U for &quot;Uscat&quot;, Land)
* A for the Air Force (A for &quot;Aer&quot;, Air)
* M for the Navy (M for &quot;Marină&quot;, Navy)
*I for the Logistics (I for &quot;Înzestrare&quot;, Logistics).

This system was subsequently abolished and all military vehicles switched to the prefix A (for &quot;Armată&quot;, Armed forces) in front of the registered numbers, which start at 100. Numbers smaller than 10,000 tend to be reserved for cars.

===Old diplomatic plates===
In the inter-war period these were standard plates, with &quot;CD&quot; prefix attached to them. By 1951 oval diplomatic plates were introduced, with CD (&quot;Corps Diplomatique&quot;) in red above a three- or four- digit number, in black. By 1965 square plates for TC (auxiliary staff) were also being issued. In the early years (at least up till 1959), CD plates had the year at the bottom, in small lettering.

===Citizen of Honor===
In the pre-1968 system, &quot;CO&quot; (&quot;Cetățean de Onoare&quot;, Citizen of Honor) was occasionally seen on private cars before 1941.

===Traffic monitoring===
Vehicles belonging to traffic monitoring service had a plate with the text &quot;Controlul circulaţiei&quot; (Traffic monitoring) and a serial number.

===Transnistria===
Wartime Transnistria occupied by Romanian forces briefly had its own special plates. These began Tr-number-regional suffix. Thus, the Cadillac of the regional administrator had Tr-1-Ods (for Odesa). These numbers were very short-lived. 

===Royal family===
Vehicles belonging to Romanian royal family all had a rectangular white plate with a drawing of the Steel crown of Romania in the middle.

==Urban myths and popular culture==

* In Communist Romania, certain license plates such as those starting with 1-B were issued only to high-ranking Communist leaders and their proteges. Many of them changed their license plates to fake military plates in the weeks following the Romanian Revolution, in order to avoid trouble. Others, such as tennis player Ilie Năstase, chose to still drive cars with plates 1-B-101 and 1-B-106 for many years afterward.
* Urban myths ascribing special meaning to certain license plate combinations crop up all the time. Such combinations have included plates starting with B 06, plates where the letter groups includes or starts with a W, and plates where the letter group has additional spacing between the letters. Some myths have some connection to reality; for example, the W myth may be related to the fact that the Protection and Guard Service chose to assign the combination WST to their entire car fleet, leading people to surmise that a car with such a license plate would not be pulled over by Police.
* Some letter combinations are far more popular than others. Among these stand out XXX, HEL (hell), IAD (hell), RAY and GOD. The customized combinations outnumber random assignments almost 3:1.

<text>In sailing, an extra is a sail that is not part of the working sail plan.

The most common extra is the spinnaker. Other extras include studding sails, the modern spanker (or tallboy), and some staysails and topsails.

In yacht racing, there are often separate divisions depending on whether extras are permitted. A race or division in which extras are not permitted is commonly called a &quot;non-spinnaker&quot; or &quot;no flying sails&quot; race or division.</text><links>

<doc id="1138795" wikidata="Q1347627" url="?curid=1138795" title="Global Certification Forum">
<text>The Global Certification Forum, known as GCF, is a London-based partnership between mobile network operators, mobile device manufacturers and the test industry. GCF was founded in 1999, and its membership has been responsible for creating an independent certification programme to help ensure global interoperability between mobile devices and networks.

The GCF certification process is based on technical requirements as specified within dedicated test specifications provided by the 3GPP, 3GPP2, OMA, IMTC, the GSM Association and others. The current GCF membership includes mobile network operators, more than 40 leading terminal manufacturers and over 65 test equipment manufacturers, test laboratories and other organizations from mainly a test environment.

== Recognized Test Organizations ==
Recognised Test Organisations (RTO) are GCF Members that have demonstrated they possess the experience, qualifications and systems to assess mobile phones and wireless devices against GCF&#x27;s Certification Criteria.

The Conformance and Field Trial RTOs are organisations to ensure quality compliance for devices per technical standards (e.g. 3GPP) and in industry guidelines for live networks (e.g. GSMA TS.11), respectively.
A GCF-certified device is much more likely to perform its best as it would be configured to fit the “DNAs” of the network connected and have resolved any issue before its product launch. Therefore, GCF certification enhances the commercial success of a model as well as its brand owner in the fiercely competitive mobile market.

From 1 January 2013, it became a requirement that all device testing associated with GCF Certification must be undertaken by an RTO. The scheme recognises Test Organisations in three distinct disciplines: Conformance Testing, Field Trials and Interoperability Testing. To become an RTO, an organisation must submit a declaration confirming that it understands GCF procedures and has the ability to conduct testing in accordance with GCF rules and the relevant RTO requirements.

From 1 January 2015, GCF took over all certification activities previously handled by the CDMA Certification Forum (CCF).
The current CEO is Lars Nielsen.

<doc id="1138797" wikidata="Q78867" url="?curid=1138797" title="Johann Michael Vogl">
<text>Johann Michael Vogl (August 10, 1768 – November 19, 1840), was an Austrian baritone singer and composer. Though famous in his day, he is remembered mainly for his close professional relationship and friendship with composer Franz Schubert.
Vogl was born in Steyr. As a young man he enrolled at the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; at Kremsmünster, where he studied languages, philosophy, and sang in several musical productions by his friend Franz Süßmayr (the same man who completed Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;). In 1786 Vogl went to Vienna to study, and later to practice law. In 1795 he debuted at the Vienna Hofoper, and quickly attracted a following for both his acting capability and the beauty of his voice.

In 1813, Franz Schubert attended a performance of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; in which Vogl sang the role of Orestes; Schubert never forgot the experience and determined to write for Vogl. The following year, when Vogl sang the role of Pizarro at the premiere of the final version of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, it is said that the 17-year-old Schubert actually sold his schoolbooks in order to afford a ticket.

When composer and singer finally met, in 1817, Vogl was as impressed with the quality of Schubert&#x27;s music as Schubert was with Vogl&#x27;s singing. Schubert wrote many of his subsequent songs with Vogl in mind. One of their early successes was an 1821 performance of &quot;Erlkönig&quot;, prior to its publication and to significant popular acclaim.

Rarely in music history has the relationship of a composer and a specific singer been so musically productive. Vogl continued to sing Schubert&#x27;s music after the death of his friend in 1828, famously singing a complete performance of &quot;Winterreise&quot; accompanied by the pianist shortly before his own death on the twelfth anniversary of the death of his friend. He died in Vienna.

<doc id="1138799" wikidata="Q2018" url="?curid=1138799" title="Catania FC">
<text>Catania Football Club, commonly known as Catania, is an Italian football club based in the city of Catania, Sicily, that plays in Serie C.

Originally founded in 1908 as &quot;Associazione Sportiva pro Educazione Fisica&quot;, the club boasts 17 appearances in the top flight, reaching eighth place in Serie A on four occasions: during the early 1960s and again in 2012–13. It is the 12th most popular team in Italy, with around 600,000 fans. The club also went on a number of dissolutions and refoundations, the last happening in 2022.

==History==
===Origins (1901–1908)===
Crews of English merchant ships brought football to Sicily. Specifically, the earliest Catania team can be traced to a match that took place on 2 May 1901 at San Raineri di Messina against Messina Football Club; the team was Royal Yacht Catania, an English ship with a Catanian crew.
The ship workers&#x27; team was a pastime, and Catania&#x27;s first professional football club was founded on 19 June 1908 by Italian film director Gaetano Ventimiglia and Francesco Sturzo d&#x27;Aldobrando, who founded the club under the name A.S. Educazione Fisica Pro Patria. Early on, they would play against sailors visiting the port of Catania, foreign ships in particular. Though their first ever match was against the Italian battleship , the game ended in a 1–1 draw and the Catania line-up that day consisted of Vassallo, Gismondo, Bianchi, Messina, Slaiter, Caccamo, Stellario, Binning, Cocuzza, Ventimiglia and Pappalardo. Just two years later, the club was renamed to Unione Sportiva Catanese.

===Foundation (1908–1943)===
In northern Italy, football was more organised and clubs in the area competed in the early Italian Football Championships, while the southern clubs competed in competitions such as the Lipton, Sant&#x27; Agata, and Agordad cups. US Catanese survived World War I, and after that, played in the local Coppa Federale Siciliana. Seven seasons later, in 1927, they were promoted to the Campionato Catanese, later winning in the 1928–29 season. As they gained promotion, the team entered the Second Division, but the fascist reform of Italian football dictated the disbandment of Catanese and the establishment of Società Sportiva Catania on 27 June 1929. The new club first competed in Serie B in the 1934–35 season, where they finished fourth; that year, Genoa won the Serie B title.

Catania played in the league for three seasons during this period before ultimately being relegated. Down in Serie C, Catania was crowned the champion in the 1938–39 season, finishing above Sicilian rivals Siracusa and Messina, who came in second and third place respectively. The club finished bottom of the league in Serie B and won only three games that season. The club&#x27;s name was briefly changed to Associazione Calcio Fascista Catania during the 1942–43 season in Serie C, which ended prematurely due to World War II.

===Rebirth (1945–1949)===

After World War II ended, a local competition was organised, the Campionato Siciliano. At the end of that season, a local team named Elefante Catania was merged into the club. The merged club kept the Catanese name and competed in Serie C during the 1945–46 season, but finished last. In the same league that season, a team called Virtus Catania competed with them, finishing eighth.

At the end of the season, Catanese and Virtus merged to form Club Calcio Catania, with the club&#x27;s first president as Santi Manganaro-Passanisi, who had previously been president of Catanese. They were promoted to Serie C, where they spent three seasons. After a duel with Reggina for first place in the league, Catania gained a promotion to Serie B for the 1948–49 season.

===Golden years (1953–1965)===
The late 1950s–1960s are considered the golden years for the Catanian club, as they managed to achieve a promotion to Serie A on two occasions during this time. Their first promotion from Serie B came when, during the 1953–54 season, they beat Cagliari and Lombardy side Pro Patria and were crowned champions of the division. Their first season in Serie A saw the club achieve a respectable 12th-place finish, but the club was forcibly relegated due to financial scandals, as were Udinese Calcio.
Under the management of Carmelo Di Bella, who had played for the club in the late 1930s, Catania gained promotion from Serie B in the 1959–60 season. Catania had lost their final game 4–2 to Brescia and needed Parma to get a good result against Triestina for the Sicilian club to secure promotion. That is exactly what happened, and Catania had gained a promotion.

Catania returned into Serie A for the 1960–61 season to begin what would be a six-year stay in the league. The newly promoted club finished in eighth above top Italian clubs such as Lazio and Napoli. This season produced several notable wins; they beat Napoli and Bologna twice, Sampdoria 3–0 at home, and most notably, Milan 4–3 in Sicily. Additionally, on the final day of the season, they beat Internazionale 2–0, with goals from Castellazzi and Calvanese. Inter lost the closely contested title that year to Juventus.

Four years later, in 1965, Catania would also finish eighth in the league, this time above Roma and Sicilian rivals Messina. Many of the club&#x27;s most notable stars played around this time, such as midfielders Alvaro Biagini and the Brazilian Chinesinho, along with wingers Carlo Facchin and Giancarlo Danova in the side. Catania won against Juventus (2–0), Fiorentina (2–0), and Lazio (1–0).

===Decline (1966–1984)===
After Catania&#x27;s relegation in 1966, Carmelo Di Bella left and the club stayed in Serie B, later playing with Palermo in the Sicilian derby before the Palermitan club was promoted. Catania followed in 1969–70 with a third-place finish, gaining a promotion. They were relegated from Serie A after one season. In that season, they had a 3–1 win against Lazio and a draw at home against Milan. Catania only scored 18 goals altogether in 30 games.

In 1973–74, they were relegated down to Serie C, but were able to get a promotion to Serie B by winning as champions. A similar situation occurred in 1976–77, where they were relegated down to Serie C. They finished second, and later third, before finally being crowned champions of what was now known as Serie C1 in 1979–80.

After three short seasons, Catania was promoted after finishing in third place, behind Milan and Lazio, into Serie A. They played the 1983–84 season in Italy&#x27;s top league, only winning once (which came against Pisa) with 12 points.

=== Further decline and revival (1985–2006) ===
The decline of Catania started after their last relegation to Serie B. The team was no longer able to reach the top division of Italian football, and instead continued to decline, remaining in Serie C1 for the latter part of the 1980s. In 1993, the team&#x27;s participation for the year was cancelled by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) due to financial irregularities.

After a court session, magistrates declared the FIGC&#x27;s decision as invalid, thus forcing it to include Catania back into the footballing fold for the year. Catania was included in the Sicilian Eccellenza (the sixth tier of Italian football). In the meantime, another Sicilian football team, Atletico Leonzio, from Lentini (in the Province of Syracuse), had been relocated in the city and renamed Atletico Catania. Despite all of this, the real Catania was able to promote back to Serie C in a short amount of time, later back to Serie B in 2002.

In 2003, Catania was at the centre of a controversy that led to the enlargement of Serie B from 20 to 24 teams, known as &quot;Caso Catania&quot;. The club claimed that Siena fielded an ineligible player in a 1–1 tie, a result which saw Catania relegated, whereas the two extra points from a victory would have kept them safe. They were awarded a 2–0 victory before the result was reverted because the guilty player was a substitute which did not play the match; Catania appealed to the judges of the Autonomous Region of Sicily, who evaluated the victory. In August, the FIGC decided to let Catania, along with Genoa and Salernitana, stay in Serie B; the newly reborn Fiorentina was also added for the 2003–04 season. The ruling led to protests and boycotts by the other Serie B clubs that delayed the start of the season, until the intervention of the Italian government.

The league was reduced to 22 teams for 2004–05, while at the same time, Serie A expanded from 18 to 20 teams. During the start of that season, Antonino Pulvirenti, chairman of the flight company Windjet and owner of Sicilian Serie C1 team Acireale, bought the club. Catania&#x27;s new ownership revived the team, and in 2005–06, Catania ended in second place, earning a promotion to Serie A.
===Return to Serie A (2006–2013)===
The 2006–07 season had Catania in Serie A for its first appearance in 22 years. In their first year back, their home form saw them peak as high as fourth place after 20 games.

Their return season changed drastically on 2 February 2007, due to the 2007 Catania football violence incident. It happened during the Sicilian derby with Palermo, where policeman Filippo Raciti was killed during football-related violence caused by Catania ultras outside the Stadio Angelo Massimino. The event led FIGC Commissioner Luca Pancalli to cancel all football-related events in the country for a period of time, including league and national team matches. Catania chairman and owner Antonino Pulvirenti announced his willingness to leave the football world, stating it was not possible to go on producing football in Catania.

After the Italian football league reopened, Catania continued on. They failed to win for 12 games in a row before beating Udinese 1–0 in late April 2007, where they eventually finished 13th.

The following season, with manager Pasquale Marino leaving for Udinese and Silvio Baldini taking charge of the team, proved to be much harder. In the Coppa Italia, Catania reached to the semi-finals, then lost to A.S. Roma. Subsequently, Baldini resigned from his post on 31 March 2008, being replaced by Walter Zenga. Despite this, Zenga managed to lead the &quot;rossazzurri&quot; off the relegation zone in a heated final week game, a 1–1 home tie to Roma, with an equaliser goal scored by Jorge Martínez in the 85th minute. Zenga was successively confirmed in charge of the team for the upcoming 2008–09 season.

On 5 June 2009, Zenga left Catania to be the manager at arch-rival football club Palermo. He was replaced by Gianluca Atzori, with one year of experience at Lega Pro Prima Divisione team Ravenna. Atzori was noted for using an attacking 4–3–3 formation at Ravenna and was expected to continue a similar approach with the &quot;Elefanti&quot;.

On 8 December 2009, Siniša Mihajlović was appointed new head coach of Catania, taking over Atzori. He signed a contract until June 2011, with the &quot;Elefanti&quot;. Arriving at the club that was dead last in the Serie A standings, Mihajlović debuted with a loss against Livorno. The following week, his team beat Juventus away in Turin with a 2–1 scoreline. After Mihajlović&#x27;s departure to Fiorentina, Catania appointed Marco Giampaolo as new head coach for the 2010–11 season. In January 2011, Catania decided to remove Giampaolo from his position due to poor results and replace him with former Argentine football player Diego Simeone, who managed to guide the Sicilians to safety before to part company by the end of the season, after only four months in charge of the team. Later, Catania appointed 37-year-old Vincenzo Montella to replace Simeone at his second managerial experience after having served as caretaker at Roma during the final part of the 2010–11 season.

Rolando Maran managed the team in the 2012–13 season, who guided Catania to a record-breaking season where they accrued 56 points from 38 Serie A matches. The season also saw Catania take a record number of home wins in one season, its record number of victories overall in a single top flight campaign, as well as its record points total in Serie A for the fifth consecutive season. They finished ahead of Internazionale at the conclusion of the season and were just five points away from competing in the UEFA Europa League.

===Second decline and 2022 bankruptcy (2013–2022) ===
After being relegated from Serie A after the 2013–14 season, Catania was again relegated to the Lega Pro and was deducted by nine points after. During the 2014–15 season, head coach and owner Antonio Pulvirenti admitted to fixing five matches.

The club announced that Sport Investment Group Italia S.p.A. (S.I.G.I.) acquired 95.4% of the club&#x27;s assets on Friday, 24 July 2020. On 16 January 2021, a preliminary purchase agreement was signed, with which a group of investors represented by the American lawyer Joe Tacopina undertook to purchase all shares from SIGI. The takeover never materialized, and on 22 December 2021, the club was declared insolvent and entered administration. Following three auctions and a takeover offer by entrepreneur Benedetto Mancini, the club&#x27;s provisional exercise by the Tribunal of Catania effectively ended on 9 April 2022, leading to its immediate exclusion from the 2021–22 Serie C season. Soon after, the Italian Football Federation formalised the club&#x27;s exclusion from the Italian professional ranks, and released all of the club&#x27;s players and non-playing staff.

===2022 refoundation (2022–present)===
In June 2022, Australian development industry entrepreneur Ross Pelligra, whose mother was born in Catania, was assigned by the city the right to register a new club in the Italian Serie D, in compliance with Article 52 of N.O.I.F. He promised to invest economical resources, with the main goal to bring back Catania in Serie A, additionally showing interest in acquiring the &quot;Torre Del Grifo&quot; training center, built during the Pulvirenti era.

The new club was renamed to Catania Società Sportiva Dilettantistica, with Ross Pelligra as president and Vincenzo Grella as vice-president, was subsequently admitted to the 2022–23 Serie D. Catania then went onto finish first in Group I in Serie D and obtain automatic promotion back into Serie C for the 2023–2024 season.

<doc id="1138806" wikidata="Q2304446" url="?curid=1138806" title="South Eastern and Chatham Railway">
<text>The South Eastern and Chatham Railway Companies Joint Management Committee (SE&amp;CRCJMC), known as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&amp;CR), was a working union of two neighbouring rival railways, the South Eastern Railway (SER) and London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR), which operated between London and south-east England. Between 1899 and 1923, the SE&amp;CR had a monopoly of railway services in Kent and to the main Channel ports for ferries to France and Belgium.

The companies had competed extensively, with some of the bitterest conflicts between British railway companies. Competing routes to the same destinations were built, so several towns in Kent had been served with a similar frequency service by both companies. In places, unfettered competition allowed two stations and services to multiple London termini.

It would be a constituent of the Southern Railway as part of the 1923 Grouping.

==Formation==
By the end of the 19th century, the SER and LC&amp;DR had fought over a small and not particularly lucrative territory for 40 years. Both were notorious for the poor punctuality of their services and the decrepitude of their rolling stock, and the struggles had driven both companies to the verge of bankruptcy. It became inevitable that they must combine or succumb.

The SE&amp;CR was formed on 1 January 1899, when the SER and LC&amp;DR formed a &quot;management committee&quot; comprising the directors of both companies. This merged the two companies&#x27; operations, although they remained legally separate, with receipts split 59% to SER and 41% LC&amp;DR until the Grouping, to avoid the costs and risks of a formal merger.
On 5 August 1899 the (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. clxviii) was passed.

==Integration==

The SE&amp;CR began connecting the two networks and new services were introduced, reaping the benefits of joint working. A significant step was the construction of a junction in 1902-4 between the SER and LC&amp;DR main lines where they crossed near Bickley and St Mary Cray, east of Bromley; the LC&amp;DR&#x27;s line via Maidstone to Ashford was connected to the SER station at Ashford; and the SER branch from Strood to Chatham alongside the LC&amp;DR&#x27;s main line to Chatham was closed prior to World War I. The overlapping networks on the Isle of Thanet (Margate-Broadstairs-Ramsgate) were rationalised by the Southern Railway. Service cuts under BR saw Gravesend lose its second station.

==Further development==

After the formation of the SE&amp;CR, three minor lines were built before the formation of the Southern Railway in 1923. They were:
*Tattenham Corner branch - Kingswood to Tattenham Corner, in 1901.
*The Sheppey Light Railway - branch off the Sheerness branch, in 1901 (closed 1950).
*Bexhill branch - Crowhurst, on the Hastings Line, to Bexhill West, in 1902 (now closed).

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 21 March 1898, a passenger train hauled by F class No. 205 was in a rear-end collision with a passenger train at , London due to a signalman&#x27;s error. Three people were killed and twenty were injured.
*In March 1904, a passenger train hauled by C class No. 294 was derailed at , Surrey.
*On 6 December 1905, the roof of station collapsed after a tie-rod snapped. Six people were killed and eight were injured.
*On 5 March 1909, an express passenger train overran signals and was in collision with a mail train at , Kent. Two people were killed and eleven were injured.
*On 11 March 1913, a passenger train failed to stop at station, Kent and crashed into a van, which was pushed through the buffers. The accident was caused by the failure to connect the brake pipe between the locomotive and its train. Ten people were injured.
*On 5 May 1919, a freight train overran signals and was in collision with a freight train that was being shunted at , Kent. One person was killed.

== SE&amp;CR locomotives ==

The LC&amp;DR&#x27;s works at Longhedge, Battersea closed in 1911 and production was concentrated at Ashford. Harry Wainwright was replaced by Richard Maunsell as Locomotive Superintendent in 1913.

==Electrification==

With the development and implementation of electrification by the L&amp;SWR, the LB&amp;SCR, the &quot;Tube&quot; companies and tram operators in the early twentieth century, the SE&amp;CR planned to start electrifying its lines. The proposed method would have used four rails, with one of the two additional rails energised at +1500 V DC and the other at −1500 V DC. Current would have been collected by side-contact, with the conductor rails protected by wooden boarding on top and at the sides. Trains would have consisted of multiple-units, each including two motor coaches, each motor coach having two traction motors: one motor coach would have been supplied by the positive conductor rail, the other by the negative. This very high voltage for rail track level systems was used in Britain only on the L&amp;YR&#x27;s 1200 V DC side-contact third-rail line from Manchester Victoria to Bury. Grouping in 1923 led to the Southern Railway adopting the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s standard of 660 V DC third rail on the SE&amp;CR&#x27;s network.

<text>Ascoli Calcio 1898 FC, commonly referred to as Ascoli, is an Italian football club based in Ascoli Piceno, Marche. The club was formed in 1898 and currently plays in Serie C.

The team traditionally play in vertical black and white stripes.

==History==

Founded in 1898 as &quot;Candido Augusto Vecchi&quot;, the team changed its name to Ascoli Vigor in 1905, U.S. Ascolana in 1921, and A.S. Ascoli in 1945. In 1955, the team was acquired and saved from bankruptcy by publishing magnate, Cino Del Duca, who merged it with his own team forming &quot;Del Duca Ascoli&quot;. The stadium still bears his and his brother&#x27;s name. In 1959 the team finally returned in Serie C for the first time since before the beginning of World War II. In 1971, under the chairmanship of Costantino Rozzi, who had acquired the team three years earlier, the team changed its name to the current one, finally being known as Ascoli Calcio 1898. From that same year, the team, led by Carlo Mazzone as coach, gained two consecutive promotions, being promoted in Serie B, and then Serie A, for the first time. The team stayed in Serie A for two seasons before being once again relegated to Serie B.

Ascoli returned to Serie A in 1978 and enjoyed a seven-year tenure in the top league, during which time they managed to finish a surprising 4th in 1980 and 6th in 1982. Some of the most notable players under the management of Mazzone and Giovan Battista Fabbri included Adelio Moro, Alessandro Scanziani, Gianfranco Bellotto, Walter Novellino and Andrea Mandorlini, as well as Walter De Vecchi and Giuseppe Greco. After relegation in 1985, the club immediately bounced back and stayed for four more years. Another return to Serie A followed in 1991 but this lasted only one season. After just missing out on promotion for two years running, the club went into decline and were relegated to Serie C1 in 1995. They would remain there for seven seasons, returning to B as Serie C1/B champions in 2002.

In August 2005, after the sentence of relegation from Serie A for both Genoa and Torino respectively due to fraud and financial troubles, Ascoli, who obtained a place in the Serie B promotion playoffs the previous season under coach Marco Giampaolo, were arbitrarily admitted to Serie A as replacements, finishing a highly credible 12th. After the end of the season, Giampaolo, who gained a reputation as one of the finest young Italian coaches, resigned, being replaced by Attilio Tesser for the 2006/2007 season. Tesser, unable to obtain good results in his time with Ascoli, was fired after a 1–0 loss at home to Empoli F.C. in the 11th matchday, and replaced by veteran coach Nedo Sonetti.

Ascoli were the first team to be officially relegated to Serie B for the 2007–08 season after a 1–0 loss to Torino F.C. on 7 May 2007. They ended the season in nineteenth place, one point above last-placed Messina.

German striker Oliver Bierhoff began his experience in Italian football with Ascoli.

===Success===

Even though from a small city of 50,000 people, Ascoli have been able to punch above their weight. Ascoli have competed 16 seasons in Serie A since 1974, with an incredible 4th and 6th spot finish respectively in the seasons of 1979–80 and 1981–82.

To complement Ascoli&#x27;s success in Serie A, the club has also achieved 2 Cadetti (Serie B Championships) in 1977–78, and 1985–86. The 1977–78 season yielded a record championship with achieving 61 points (2 points for a victory). Ascoli have competed in Serie B 13 times, with a total of 5 promotion seasons.

Ascoli have made way to Serie B with only two winning seasons in Serie C and C1B. These were in 1971–72, and 2001–02.

Another one of Ascoli&#x27;s successes is the fact that, for a city of 50,000, their record home attendance has reached 36,500, equivalent to more than 70% of the city&#x27;s population. In Serie A this was seen against Juventus and the famous season in 1982–83 where Ascoli saved themselves from relegation in the last game of the Serie A season against Cagliari, who were subsequently relegated. However, with stadium restrictions introduced since then, the maximum attendance allowed in the Stadio Cino e Lillo Del Duca is now 21,000–24,000. Nonetheless, when filled, it is still an amazing achievement for such a small city.

Other success were in the Mitropa Cup in 1986–87, the Capodanno Challenge, and the Red Leaf Cup. Ascoli were also finalists in the Anglo-Italia Cup, during Ascoli&#x27;s last season in Serie B 1994–95, before Ascoli long await in Serie C1 before an emotional return to Serie B for the 2002–03 season.

Under the reign of the great president of Ascoli Calcio – Costantino Rozzi, Ascoli competed 14 of their amazing 16 seasons in Serie A, again another amazing achievement from a club who were once playing in the regional divisions of Marche. Not only this, but Rozzi was able to implement players who were born and raised through the ranks of Ascoli. In the mid to late 1980s saw Giuseppe Iachini, Domenico Agostini, Giuseppe Carillo, and Lorenzo Scarafoni, help Ascoli ensure a return to Serie A and survival the following season. Once Iachini left Agostini, Carillo and Scarafoni, were first team starters as well as Marino Fioravanti and Antonio Aloisi on the bench. Aloisi went on to compete in many season for Ascoli.

Another success is Carlo Mazzone, once at the heart of Del Duca Ascoli&#x27;s defence playing 9 seasons, led Ascoli for another 10 or so seasons as manager. Mazzone guided Ascoli from Serie C to Serie A, including Ascoli&#x27;s 6th-placed finish in 1981–82.

===Bankruptcy and re-birth===

During the 2013–14 Lega Pro Prima Divisione season, the Court of Ascoli Piceno declared the bankruptcy of the club. The court also estimated the residual value of the club assets were €862,000. A new company, Ascoli Picchio F.C. 1898 successfully bid the assets. FIGC also accepted the admission of the new company to the new season without relegation.

In mid-2015 Ascoli, originally runners-up to Teramo in 2014–15 Lega Pro, were declared champions of group B and promoted after Teramo&#x27;s relegation for involvement in the 2015 Italian football scandal.

On 14 June 2018, club president Francesco Bellini, after first having declared the sale of the club, and having received several offers from prospective owners, accepted the offer of a Roman entrepreneur of Bricofer Group, Massimo Pulcinelli. On 18 July 2018, the club was officially re-branded as Ascoli Calcio 1898 F.C. S.p.A. ahead of the upcoming 2018–19 season.

In the summer of 2021, the North Sixth Group of entrepreneur Matt Rizzetta, based in New York, already present in Italian football with a stake in Campobasso Calcio, acquired a 31% stake in Ascoli Calcio with an option to increase to 51%. The acquisition combined North Sixth Group with Massimo Pulcinelli and Bricofer, the largest homeware retailer in Italy, to build an ambitious project for Ascoli around the world. Following the acquisition, North Sixth Group negotiated an exclusive content rights agreement with Italian Football TV, the largest online content platform for Italian football fans in North America. The agreement provides Ascoli Calcio the only exclusive content partnership of any Italian professional football club.

===Rivalries===

The biggest derby in Marche is between Ascoli and Sambenedettese (Samb, Samba), although the derby with Ancona is better known. The last time the &quot;derby&quot; was played between Ascoli and Sambenedettese in a league season was in 1986. San Benedetto del Tronto is a city in the province of Ascoli Piceno, and only 20 minutes from the city of Ascoli Piceno; the derby is fuelled by intense local pride and rivalry on both sides, and remains passionate despite the length of time since it was last played.

The Ancona derby was the second largest; Ancona and Ascoli have been the two most successful clubs of Marche. This rivalry stems partly from the fact that Ancona is the capital of Marche, but Ascoli (Asculum) was the capital of ancient Picenun. The battles between the Ascolani and Anconetani have been intense, and there is very much a fight to be &quot;La Regina Delle Marche&quot; (the queen of Marche).

Fermana is the final significant derby for Ascoli; both teams are located near each other in the province of Ascoli Piceno, alongside San Benedetto del Tronto. Despite the fact that Fermana have historically been weaker than Ascoli, this still is a derby for the Ascolani and Fermani, with both supporters not wanting to lose this game.

Other rivalries include Livorno, Verona, Pescara and Inter.

==Stadium==
Ascoli play their home matches at the 12,461 capacity, &quot;Stadio Cino e Lillo Del Duca&quot;, located on the outskirts of Ascoli Piceno.

<text>Somerset Street is a street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is divided into Somerset Street East and Somerset Street West by the Rideau Canal.

==Somerset Street East==
Somerset Street East is a short road that runs through the neighbourhood of Sandy Hill from the University of Ottawa campus to the west and Strathcona Park to the east. Somerset also used to extend east over the Rideau River towards St. Laurent Boulevard. However, that bridge was destroyed by flooding in 1952 and never replaced. The street was renamed Donald Street east of the river. In 2015, a new bicycle/pedestrian bridge (Adàwe Crossing) was completed across the river on the site of the old bridge, and the street has become an important bicycle corridor between the university and downtown Ottawa. By 2017, bicycle volumes accounted for 65% of street traffic and the street was re-striped with advisory bike lanes.

==Somerset Street West==
Also known as Ottawa Road #36, Somerset Street West begins at the Queen Elizabeth Driveway in the east and continues west to Wellington Street West where it ends at Somerset Square. Somerset Street West houses the backbone of Ottawa&#x27;s Chinatown, between Bay Street in the east to Preston Street in the west, which is the centre of Ottawa&#x27;s Little Italy. The area of the street between Bank and O&#x27;Connor is known as Somerset Village.

The section west of Booth street was formerly known as Cedar Street, and the section between Booth and Bell streets was formerly Reserve Street.

The Ottawa Electric Railway ran along Somerset Street West between Bank Street going west towards Britannia Park.

331 Somerset Street, a former home of Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King from 1901 to 1910 during his time as Minister of Labour, is designated as an Ottawa heritage property. 

==In between==
In the 1870s, as the area was developed, a bridge was proposed linking the two Somerset Streets over the Rideau Canal. However, this bridge never came into existence. Today, on the east side of the canal, there is a pedestrian link from the multi-use pathway that runs alongside the canal, across Colonel By Drive, and under Nicholas Street and the transitway, onto the University of Ottawa campus. The street continues through the campus as Marie Curie Private, with traffic restricted to bicycles in the westbound direction.

The Corktown Footbridge connects the two sides, but is restricted to non-motorized traffic. The bridge opened to the public on September 21, 2006.

<doc id="1138813" wikidata="Q3760755" url="?curid=1138813" title="Georgia Southern Eagles">
<text>The Georgia Southern Eagles are the athletic team(s) of Georgia Southern University (GS). The Eagles compete in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) (formerly I-A) and are members of the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference. Prior to joining the Sun Belt Conference in 2014, the Eagles were members of the Trans America Athletic Conference (presently known as the ASUN Conference) and the Southern Conference (SoCon). During their time at the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS/I-AA) level, the Eagles have won six national championships.

The only Georgia Southern teams which compete outside the Sun Belt do so in sports that are not sponsored by that conference. Women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving competes in the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association. Rifle, a fully co-educational sport in which GS fields a women-only team, competes in the SoCon. Men&#x27;s soccer will compete in the Mid-American Conference starting in the fall 2021 season, following the demise of the Sun Belt men&#x27;s soccer league.

== Sports sponsored ==
=== Baseball ===
The baseball team is led by head coach Rodney Hennon, who is in his seventeenth year at Georgia Southern. Georgia Southern played its first year of baseball in 1933.
The team went to the College World Series in 1973 and 1990 and has appeared in 11 NCAA regionals. The team was also crowned the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics National Champions in 1962, sweeping Portland State.

The team won the 2009 Southern Conference baseball tournament with a 7 to 3 victory over top seeded Elon and clinch its first SoCon title since 2002. They also won the 2011 SoCon Tournament after Chris Beck pitched a complete-game shutout against Samford University. They lost two games against future national champion South Carolina, losing a 2–1 decision, and NC State, coming short by three runs in a 5–2 game.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
The head coach of the Georgia Southern men&#x27;s basketball squad is Charlie Henry. Introduced on March 29, 2023, Henry is the 15th head coach in program history. The team participated in the NCAA Division I Tournament in 1983, 1987 and 1992, and the NIT in 1988, 1989 and 2006. The first year of men&#x27;s basketball at Georgia Southern was 1926, and the first year the school played in Division I was 1971.

Georgia Southern basketball player Roger Moore was the first African-American athlete to receive a scholarship in the University System of Georgia.

=== Football ===
The head coach of the Eagles is Clay Helton. The Eagles have won six NCAA FCS (I-AA) National Championships (1985, 1986, 1989, 1990, 1999, and 2000). In addition, the Eagles have won ten Southern Conference championships (1993, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2011, and 2012) and one Sun Belt Conference championship (2014); with the Eagles&#x27; first Sun Belt title, they became only the third team, after Nevada in 1992 and Marshall in 1997, to win their conference championship in their first year at the FBS level. Home football games are played at Allen E. Paulson Stadium, known as &quot;The Prettiest Little Stadium in America.&quot; Georgia Southern fielded its first football team in 1910; however, the sport was suspended for World War II and was not restarted until 1982.

==== Erk Russell ====

In 1981, former University of Georgia Defensive Coordinator Erk Russell was hired to restart the football program at Georgia Southern College (as the university was called at the time), a program that had not competed in forty years. Erk Russell became America&#x27;s winningest coach, leading to the Eagles to three national championships. The Eagles extended Division I&#x27;s longest home win streak from 26 to 37 games, gaining distinction as the only 15–0 college team of the twentieth century. Russell&#x27;s final record at Georgia Southern, after his retirement in 1989, was 83–22–1 (.788).

Erk Russell addressed the team the night before his shocking and sudden death on September 8, 2006. Georgia Southern University and thousands of friends, family, and fans gathered at Paulson Stadium to mourn the passing of Erk Russell, one of America&#x27;s most exciting and successful college football coaches.

Since Russell&#x27;s departure, football has continued to be prominent at Georgia Southern. Head coach Tim Stowers succeeded Russell and won the 1990 national title, while Paul Johnson added two more in 1999 and 2000 with teams led by all-time Division I rushing leader Adrian Peterson.

==== Beautiful Eagle Creek ====

In the early 1980s, a drainage ditch that the team had to cross several times a day during football practice came to be called Beautiful Eagle Creek by popular Head Football Coach Erk Russell. When the Eagles traveled to Northern Iowa during the 1985 playoffs, Coach Russell brought along a jug of Eagle Creek water to sprinkle on the field. The Eagles were victorious and went on to win many national championships with the help of that magical water. Today, the jug is on display at Georgia Southern University and signs have been erected along the creek.

==== The Hugo Bowl ====
In 1989, ESPN was to broadcast a &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game between the Georgia Southern Eagles and the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders. However, Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, was headed straight towards the coast of Georgia. At the time of landfall, Hugo ranked as the eleventh most intense hurricane to strike U.S. this century, and it delivered the highest ever recorded storm surge on the East Coast. Nevertheless, the decision was made to continue with the game. For safety purposes, an open line was kept between the press box at Paulson Stadium and the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The Eagles went on to defeat MTSU by a score of 26–0 in a game known as the Hugo Bowl.

== Traditions ==

=== Nickname ===

Eagles is the third nickname of Georgia Southern University. From 1924 to 1941, the nickname was the Blue Tide. After World War II, athletic teams were referred to as the Professors, as the school was a teachers college. However, in 1959, when the school was renamed Georgia Southern College, a student vote was held to determine the new mascot. Eagles was chosen over Colonels by a narrow margin.

=== Plain uniforms ===
When the football program was revived in 1982, the school did not have a large budget and coach Erk Russell ordered solid blue helmets and asked the players to put a white strip of tape down the middle. The uniforms consisted of plain white pants and blue jerseys without names. With the subsequent success of the Eagles, the basic simple design of the uniforms has remained the same.

<doc id="1138815" wikidata="Q6137332" url="?curid=1138815" title="Nissan CA engine">
<text>The CA engine is a series of Inline-4 piston engines from Nissan. It is designed for a wide variety of smaller Nissan vehicles to replace the Z engine and some smaller, four-cylinder L series engines. The &quot;CA&quot; stands for Clean Air, due to the installation of Nissan emission reducing technology, called NAPS-X.

The CA is an iron block, aluminum head design with a timing belt, cheaper to make than the timing chain setup on the Z and L engines. Earlier versions featured SOHC and eight valves. The new CA block design was a scaled-up E series block with timing shaft and other ancillaries removed. The oil pump is fitted directly onto the crank nose and the distributor is driven by the end of the camshaft. Like the E series and the A block from which the E was derived, Nissan used a taller block for the largest stroked 2.0-litre engine. The CA was designed to be compact and light, with a CA16 requiring only of space (compared to for the earlier Z16), while weighing 23% less at .

Later versions featured DOHC with 16 valves for increased efficiency at high engine speeds and a smoother power delivery. The hydraulic lifters are interchangeable between all DOHC RB and VG series engines excepting those with solid lifters. The Nissan CA would also be developed into a diesel engine, known as the CD, which replaced the four-cylinder LD series.

Production of the CA series ceased in 1994. The engine was deemed too expensive to produce due to its cast-iron block, while it also no longer met the ever-changing Japanese emission standards emerging at the time. The 1.8 L and 2.0 L versions were replaced by the all-aluminium SR series as Nissan&#x27;s primary four-cylinder engine, while the smaller 1.6 L version was replaced by the GA series. Engines for the low volume European markets, such as the 200SX, were supplied by the overstock between Japanese and Australian markets.

* 1992-1995 Reliant Scimitar Sabre 1800Ti

===CA18DET===

The CA18DET was the last version of the CA engine to be released, manufactured from 1985 to 1994. It is a turbocharged version of the CA18DE, producing and . It has a brand new DOHC aluminum head with 16 valves. The turbocharger was also upgraded to a Garrett T25 (.48 A/R) unit for increased flow capacity, and as such, was fitted with an intercooler to help prevent the onset of pre-ignition and/or detonation. Fuel was delivered via Multiport Fuel Injection. Bore and stroke is . An electronically controlled fuel injection system was used with (flow capacity) injectors.

There were 2 versions of the CA18DET available, yet only one was produced for Japan. The late model Japanese CA18DETs received 8 port (low port) heads, with butterfly actuated auxiliary ports in the lower intake manifold which corresponded with 8 ports in the head.

Below c. 3,800 rpm, only one set (4 ports open, 1 per cylinder) of long, narrow ports would be open, accelerating the intake charge to the cylinder. This allowed for quick spool and good low-end tractability. At the 3800 rpm change over, not only would the ECCS shift into batch fire (as opposed to sequential) fuel injection, but it also opened the second set of short, wide ports (8 ports open, 2 per cylinder) which assisted in high RPM flow.

This engine is known for stronger torque characteristics, as well as faster spool at lower RPMs. However, due to displacement-based taxation and cost of emissions testing in Europe, the CA18DET was sold as the only available engine in the S13 chassis 200SX (Euro model) until replaced by the S14 in 1994. The Euro motors received the 4 port (high port) head and intake manifold, as well as revised ECCS (&quot;Electronic Concentrated Control System&quot;) parameters.

It was used in the following vehicles:
* 1987-1988 Silvia S12 RS-X
* 1987-1989 Silvia S12 Grand Prix final edition in Europe
* 1988-mid 1990 Nissan Silvia/180SX S13 (Japanese market)
* 1987-1989 Nissan Bluebird RNU12 SSS ATTESA Limited (Japanese Market)
* 1989-1994 Nissan 200SX RS13-U Europe.
* 1985-1990 Nissan Auster &quot;1.8Xtt&quot; and &quot;Euroform Twincam Turbo&quot;

==CA20==
The CA20 is a series of SOHC engine produced from 1982 through 1991 (possibly longer for the CA20P). Bore and stroke is .

===CA20P===

The CA20P is a carbureted, single overhead cam designed to run on LPG. It came in two claimed different power outputs, initially JIS gross at 5,600 rpm and later JIS net at 4,800 rpm. The respective torque figures are at 2,800 rpm and at 2,000 rpm. This engine was usually installed in professional cars and was not regularly available to private buyers. It was replaced by the NA20P engine in mid-1991.

Applications:
* Nissan Cedric NJY30 (1983.06-1987.06)
* Nissan Cedric NJY31 (1987.06-1991.06)
* Nissan Gloria NJY30 (1983.06-1987.06)
* Nissan Gloria NJY31 (1987.06-1991.06)

===CA20S===

The CA20S is an SOHC engine produced from 1982 through 1987, fed by a carburetor. It typically produces a peak power of at 5,200 rpm and has a peak torque rating of at 3,600 rpm.

Applications:
* Nissan Stanza
* Nissan Prairie M11/M12 Europe
* Nissan Auster
* Nissan Bluebird Series 3 1985-1986 (Australia)
* Nissan Bluebird U11 Estate 1985-1990 (Europe)
* Nissan Bluebird T12 1985-1988 (Europe)
* Nissan Laurel (C32) 1984-1990 (no twin spark)
* Nissan Skyline GL and GLE (R31) ()
* 1983–1987 Nissan Cedric/Gloria Y30 ( at 5,600 rpm)
* Nissan Vanette C22 / Vanette Largo GC22 Model, Japan

===CA20E===

The SOHC CA20E was produced from August 1981 to 1991. It produces and . Fuel was delivered via Multiport Fuel Injection. Dual spark plugs per cylinder were used in some variants of this engine for enhanced combustion efficiency, called NAPS-X.

It was used in the following vehicles:
* 1984-1988 Nissan 200SX (US &amp; Canada) / Nissan Gazelle (Australia)
* 1986-1992 Nissan Pintara R31/U12 (Australia)
* 1984-1990 Nissan Stanza
* 1982-1988 Stanza Wagon (US)/ Multi (Canada) M10
* 1987-1989 Nissan Bluebird / Bluebird ATTESA U12 (and was replaced by the SR20DE in the Series 2 U12 Bluebirds)
* 1988-1990 Nissan Bluebird T72
* 1986-1991 Nissan Pintara

===CA20DE/CA20DET/CA20ET===

There was never a factory-produced twin-cam 2.0 L CA engine, nor there was a turbo version. However, the blocks are similar, and it is possible to fit the DOHC CA18DE/CA18DET twin-cam head into the SOHC CA20 block. However, the DOHC/SOHC manifolds are different and the timing pulley/belts are not compatible. Despite this, however, several examples of a CA20DET engine have been built.

==Stroker kits==
Tomei and JUN of Japan produced 2–litre stroker kits for the CA18. Also companies like Norris Designs and Spool Imports produces CA20 stroker kits as well as a CA20 engine.

<doc id="1138821" wikidata="Q272096" url="?curid=1138821" title="Andrea Leeds">
<text>Andrea Leeds (born Antoinette Lees, August 18, 1913 – May 21, 1984) was an American film actress. A popular supporting player of the late 1930s, Leeds was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Stage Door&quot; (1937). As she began progressing to more prominent roles, Leeds retired after marrying, and later became a successful horse breeder.

== Early life ==
Leeds was born on August 18, 1913, in Butte, Montana, the only child of Charles and Lina (née 
Deoviddio) Lees. Charles was a mining engineer; his mining interests led to Leeds living most of her younger life in Mexico. Initially planning to be a writer, Leeds earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Los Angeles.

== Career ==
Leeds began her film career in 1933, playing bit parts and using her given name Andrea Lees. Under the name Andrea Leeds, she played her first substantial role in the film &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (1936) and achieved another success with her next film &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; (1937).

As part of an ensemble cast that included Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers and Lucille Ball, Leeds was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as an aspiring actress in &quot;Stage Door&quot; (1937). Her wholesome quality led to her being cast in &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot; (1938) playing Miss Humanity, a woman considered by a jaded Hollywood executive to represent the ideal American woman. However, the film was a critical and commercial failure. In 1938, Leeds also read for the role of and did screen tests for the role of Melanie in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;; however the role was given to Olivia de Havilland.

She next appeared in two films opposite Joel McCrea (who earlier played her brother in &quot;Come and Get It&quot;), &quot;Youth Takes a Fling&quot; (1938) and &quot;They Shall Have Music&quot; (1939), for the first time playing the lead female role. She continued to play the romantic female lead in an adventure film &quot;The Real Glory&quot;, opposite Gary Cooper and David Niven, and opposite Don Ameche in &quot;Swanee River&quot; (1939), the first Technicolor biography of Stephen Foster. Her final film &quot;Earthbound&quot; (1940) was a fantasy murder mystery in which her character is aided by the ghost of her late husband to solve his murder.

Although her films were successful and she remained a popular actress, Leeds retired in 1940 after marrying in 1939.

== Personal life ==
On October 25, 1939, Leeds married Robert Stewart Howard, son of California businessman and racehorse owner Charles S. Howard. Together, they had two children, Robert Jr. and Leann, who died of cancer in 1971.

The elder Howard owned and raced Seabiscuit, and with her husband, Leeds became a successful horse owner/breeder. The couple also owned the Howard Manor in Palm Springs, a hotel originally built as the Colonial House by Las Vegas casino owner and Purple Gang member Al Wertheimer. The hotel currently operates as the Colony Palms Hotel, and features the Winner&#x27;s Circle Suite in honor of Seabiscuit and the Howards. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1962, Leeds ran a jewelry business.

== Death ==
Leeds died from cancer at age 70 on May 21, 1984, in Riverside, California. She was interred in Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California. In 1994, Leeds received a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.

<text>Jorge Guillén Álvarez (; 18 January 18936 February 1984) was a Spanish poet, a member of the Generation of &#x27;27, a university teacher, a scholar and a literary critic.

In 1957-1958, he delivered the Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard University, which were published in 1961 under the title &quot;Language and Poetry: Some Poets of Spain&quot;. The final lecture was a tribute to his colleagues in the Generation of &#x27;27.
In 1983, he was named Hijo Predilecto de Andalucía. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.

==Biography==
Jorge Guillén was born in Valladolid where he spent his childhood and adolescence. From 1909 to 1911 he lived in Switzerland. He studied at the universities of Madrid – lodging in the Residencia de Estudiantes – and Granada, where he took his &quot;licenciatura&quot; in philosophy in 1913. His life paralleled that of his friend Pedro Salinas, whom he succeeded as a Spanish &quot;lector&quot; at the Collège de Sorbonne in the University of Paris from 1917 to 1923. While in Paris, he met and, in 1921, married Germaine Cahen. They had two children, a son Claudio born in 1924 who became a noted critic and scholar of comparative literature, and a daughter Teresa who married the Harvard professor Stephen Gilman.

He took his doctorate at the University of Madrid in 1924 with a dissertation on Góngora&#x27;s notoriously difficult and, at that time, neglected long poem Polifemo. This was also the period when his first poems were starting to be published in &quot;España&quot; and &quot;La pluma&quot;.
He was appointed to the chair of Spanish Literature at the University of Murcia from 1925 to 1929, where, with Juan Guerrero Ruiz and José Ballester Nicolás, he founded and edited a literary magazine called &quot;Verso y Prosa&quot;.

He continued to visit the Residencia de Estudiantes although his academic responsibilities limited his attendance to vacations. This allowed him to make the acquaintance of the younger members of the Generation – such as Rafael Alberti and Federico García Lorca. He became a regular correspondent of the latter and, on the occasion of a visit by Lorca to the Arts Club of Valladolid in April 1926, Guillén delivered an introduction to a poetry reading which was a considered and sympathetic appraisal of a man whom he considered to be already a poetic genius, although he had only published one collection.

He also participated in the Tercentenary celebrations in honour of Góngora. The volume of &quot;Octavas&quot; that he was supposed to edit, however, was never completed but he did give a reading of some of his own poems at an event in Seville with great success.

He became the &quot;lector&quot; at Oxford University from 1929 to 1931, and was appointed to a professorship at the University of Seville in 1932. On 8 March 1933, he was present at the premiere in Madrid of García Lorca&#x27;s play &quot;Bodas de sangre&quot;. In August 1933, he was able to attend performances at the Magdalena Palace in Santander by the travelling theatre company &quot;La Barraca&quot; that Lorca led. On 12 July 1936 he was present at a party in Madrid that took place just before García Lorca departed to Granada for the last time before his murder. It was there that Lorca read his new play &quot;La Casa de Bernarda Alba&quot; for the last time.

On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 he was back in Valladolid and was briefly imprisoned in Pamplona by Francoists for political reasons. He returned to his post in Seville and continued there until July 1938, when he decided to go into exile in the USA together with his wife and two teenage children. Apart from the turmoil in Spain itself, the fact that his wife was Jewish might have caused him concern.

He joined Salinas at Wellesley College and stayed there as the Professor of Spanish from 1941 to his retirement in 1957. 
He retired to Italy. In 1958 in Florence he married Irene Mochi-Sismondi, his first wife having died in 1947. He continued to give lectures at Harvard, Princeton and Puerto Rico, and for a spell was Mellon Professor of Spanish at the University of Pittsburgh, until he broke his hip in a fall in 1970. In 1976 he moved to the city of Málaga.

In 1976, he was awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the most prestigious prize for Spanish-language writers, and in 1977 the Premio Internacional Alfonso Reyes. He died in Málaga in 1984, aged 91 and was buried there in the Anglican Cemetery of Saint George.

==Analysis of his work==

===Cántico===

====1928 edition====

Although a glimpse at the collected poems of Guillén suggests that he was a prolific poet, he was slow to get started. He only seems to have started writing poems when he was in Paris in 1919 when he was already 25. Over the next 10 years he published quite frequently in the small magazines of the day and began to build a name for himself amongst the members of his generation, including Dámaso Alonso and Federico García Lorca. As early as 1923 Pedro Salinas urged him to publish a collection but he would not be hurried. Two of his key character traits are revealed by this long gestation period: his quest for perfection and an innate reserve. He was in fact the last of the major figures of the generation to gather together a collection, the first instalment of &quot;Cántico&quot;- at this stage a collection of 75 poems – which was published by the &quot;Revista de Occidente&quot; (a journal edited by Ortega y Gasset) in 1928. He was by this time 35.

Correspondence with García Lorca shows just how painstaking he was, spending months polishing, revising and correcting poems that he had already written and published, to a point where they were practically unrecognisable from the way they had first appeared in public. Clarity and coherence were his major objectives but he also seemed to wish to avoid obvious self-revelation and any hint of sentimentality. Lorca&#x27;s reaction in a postcard to Guillén written on 27 December 1928 captures the elements that dominate most critical responses to the latter&#x27;s poetry: an opposition between the jubilant, physical celebration of reality that his poems try to capture and, on the other hand, its extreme technical purity, which can seem cold and overly intellectual.

During his time in Paris, Guillén had come under the influence of Paul Valéry. Valéry was closely associated with the ideal of pure poetry and Guillén later recalled him saying that &quot;Pure poetry is what is left after the elimination of everything that is not poetry.&quot; He was also inspired by Valéry&#x27;s belief that a poet should only write one book – &quot;Un, qui est le bon et le seul de son être&quot; - a remark that makes sense of Guillén&#x27;s career, both of the accretive process that led ultimately to the finished &quot;Cántico&quot;, and also of the impulse that led him to combine all his published poetry into one collection &quot;Aire nuestro&quot; in 1968. He also translated four of Valéry&#x27;s poems, including the celebrated &quot;Le Cimetière marin,&quot; into Spanish. However, in &quot;Language and Poetry&quot;, he also recorded a debt to the poetic rigour of Góngora, showing that he could trace this concern for stylistic purity back much further than Valéry.

Even in his earliest poems, such as &quot;Gran silencio&quot;, the language is impersonal; the poet does not make any appearance in the poem. His poems offer an ecstatic reaction to the geometrical forms or the objects they describe but this is a generic reaction not Guillén&#x27;s personal response. He is like an aesthetician or philosopher presenting things for the reader&#x27;s edification. In &quot;La salida&quot;, the only verbs that occur are infinitives. This means that what is described has no specific agent or time, again helping Guillén to become anonymous and guard against sentimentality. Like Valéry, he also writes poems that reflect upon poetry itself, for example &quot;El ruiseñor&quot; and &quot;La rosa&quot;, both written in Guillén&#x27;s favourite form, the &quot;décima&quot;, typically a stanza of 10 octosyllabic lines rhyming ABBAACCDDC, although he used many variations, such as a rhyme scheme borrowed from the French &quot;dizain&quot;, ABABCCDEED.

However, although Valéry,

read and reread with great devotion by the Castilian poet, was a model of exemplary elevation of subject matter and of exemplary rigor of style, 
Guillén concludes by saying that &quot;Cántico&quot;

can be defined negatively as the antithesis of Valéry&#x27;s Charmes.

Guillén stresses a &quot;determination to treat poetry as creation, a poem as a world in quintessence.&quot; For Valéry, poetry is a process of self-discovery, an exercise in consciousness, working out what it means to be an individual poet exploring reality. Guillén accepts reality for what it is and he wants to show what he has in common with other humans in the timeless experience of being. It is a phenomenology that derives from Ortega y Gasset as exemplified in his work &quot;Meditaciones del Quijote&quot;.

====1936 edition====

The next edition of &quot;Cántico&quot; contained 125 poems. It was published by &quot;Cruz y Raya&quot; – a journal edited by José Bergamín – in 1936. While many members of his generation had suffered some form of crisis towards the end of the 1920s – amongst them Alberti, Garcia Lorca, Aleixandre, Cernuda – there were no signs of personal upheaval or radical change in Guillén&#x27;s approach to poetry. Instead there is a deepening of the approach to reality contained in the first edition. Reality is potentially perfect. All it requires is the active participation of an onlooker to raise it to its full potency as explained by Ortega in the &quot;Meditaciones&quot;.

There is stylistic development as well in that some of the new poems are lengthy; &quot;Salvación de la primavera&quot; amounts to 55 quatrains (220 lines) and &quot;Más allá&quot;, which eventually became the very first book in the collection, consists of 50 quatrains. There are also more medium-length poems of around 40-50 lines, such as &quot;Viento saltado&quot; and &quot;El desterrado&quot;, most of which were written or started during Guillén&#x27;s period of residence at Oxford. The collection is grouped into 5 sections, frequently book-ended by these longer poems, so that it has a more formally pleasing shape. The versification is also more varied; there are many more &quot;romances&quot; (octosyllabic lines with assonance in the even-numbered lines); Guillén starts to write sonnets; he introduces longer lines and also the assonantal quatrains of the longer poems.

The longer poems are inevitably less abstract and impersonal but they do not show any real break with his approach to poetry. In place of the concentrated focus on one object or small group of objects, the longer poems have scope for a more comprehensive assessment of exterior reality. Instead of flashes of ecstasy, the pursuit of plenitude and essence is an ongoing quest. The poetry continues to avoid anecdotal narrative but the greater circumstantial and temporal definition of the longer poems gives this edition an enhanced awareness of human contact with the real world. There is in addition a far more detailed examination of big themes such as love – &quot;Salvación de la primavera&quot; – and death – &quot;Muerte a lo lejos&quot; – although the poet takes a very detached view of death. It will happen one day and until then, he can enjoy life in the present.

Some of the new poems have epigraphs from Walt Whitman, such as &quot;El desterrado&quot;. He might have come across Whitman during his time in France but his interest seems to have been consolidated during his Oxford period. There are overlaps between Whitman&#x27;s poetry and the thinking of Ortega as enshrined in his famous formula &quot;Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia&quot; from the &quot;Meditaciones&quot;, in other words &quot;I am the sum of my individual self and the things that surround me/that I perceive&quot;. This is perhaps explained most fully in &quot;Viento saltado&quot;, which he began in Oxford in 1931. It is a clear example of one of Guillén&#x27;s stylistic characteristics, the use of exclamations. Everything in the poem is an exclamation as he displays an almost childlike delight at being buffeted by a blustery wind.

====1945 edition====

A lot happened in Guillén&#x27;s life before he published the next edition of &quot;Cántico&quot; in Mexico in 1945. By now the book had more than doubled in size, to 270 poems. A reader would expect events such as the mysterious death of his friend García Lorca, the Spanish Civil War, exile to the USA and the Second World War to have an effect on Guillén&#x27;s poetry. Exile in particular seems to have hit him hard because he did not speak very good English and he remained very attached to his Spanish background. But biographical references in his poems remain elusive. There is in this edition an increase in the number of poems that deal with pain and death. He also oscillates between extremes in a new and different way; some poems are stridently affirmative of his values while others are far more meditative and tranquil than hitherto. There are poems that deal with simple domestic pleasures, such as the home, family life, friendship and parenthood, which do not have any counterpart in the earlier editions.

There are stylistic innovations. In &quot;Language and Poetry&quot;, one of the lectures is about the prosaic language of the mediaeval poet Gonzalo de Berceo, whom Guillén admired for his humility and faith. In the poem &quot;Equilibrio&quot;, there is a plainness of syntax, compared with earlier poems, that seems to suggest that he is trying to emulate this. There are poems which suggest that Guillén feels that he is now living in an alien environment, such as &quot;Vida urbana&quot;.

There is also the emergence of the theme of pain and suffering. Sometimes pain prevents the realization of plenitude, as in &quot;Muchas gracias, adiós&quot;; sometimes awareness of pain and death can help to remind the poet of the importance of fighting for life. Although there are very few autobiographical references in &quot;Cántico&quot;, in this edition it is tempting to see references to the protracted illness and frequent hospital visits of his wife before her death in 1947, as well as the poet&#x27;s own bouts of ill health. In &quot;Su persona&quot;, he argues that loneliness is not to be defeated by turning to memories of shared joys, because they are merely phantasms. Instead, you have to face reality and find the good that exists there. In this edition, Guillén acknowledges that reality has a dark side but affirms that it can be resisted and must be resisted.

====1950 the final edition====

The completed version contained 334 poems and was published in Buenos Aires. Amongst the new poems are ten very long ones that exemplify Guillén&#x27;s search for clarity and cohesion. &quot;A vista de hombre&quot;, for example, was begun in a New York hotel and deals with a view of an unnamed metropolis from a skyscraper. It develops the poet&#x27;s thoughts on his relationship with the mass of people living and working in this city until it closes with the poet retiring to his bed. Unlike García Lorca in &quot;Poeta en Nueva York&quot; or countless other poets, the city is not inhuman, cold, abstract. The emphasis is on the mass of humanity it holds. The city is a mix of good and evil, man&#x27;s heroic endeavours and barbarity – a reality that has to be embraced in totality even when you cannot understand it. The poet is both an isolated individual in a hotel room and a member of this society.

Others of the new poems also echo this theme, showing that Guillén does not want to reject modern urban life but instead to find a way of incorporating it into his affirmative scheme.

Although various poems evoke Murcia, Oxford and Manhattan, &quot;Luz natal&quot; contains the only place name in the whole of &quot;Cántico&quot;, el cerro de San Cristóbal, a hill outside Valladolid which he visited in 1949 to see his sick father. It is a meditation on the significance of this place, from which he began his journey towards reality and from which he still takes his bearings. It adds a new dimension to Guillén&#x27;s poetry – history. The protagonist is also a product of history and he has to come to terms with the good and the bad sides of his culture&#x27;s history, just as he has to accept the good and bad of the reality that faces him.

In this final edition, Guillén completes his task of showing that human life is charged with structure and meaning which we need to explore in all its fullness. A passage from &quot;Language and Poetry&quot; seems to sum up his poetics in this collection:

:Reality is depicted in the poem, but not described in its external likeness. Reality, not realism. And feeling, without which there is no poetry, has no need of gesticulation. …..This restraint in the displaying of emotions retains their vehemence, and indeed doubles their intensity. But for ears that hear not, harmonies such as these are almost confused with silence. That is why some of these poets were tried and found wanting for their coldness, even though they were dedicated to declaring their enthusiasm for the world, their fervour for life, their love for love.

===Clamor===

It was seven years before Guillén published another collection of poems, &quot;Maremágnum&quot; in 1957. This was the start of his second portmanteau collection, &quot;Clamor&quot;. The other two constituent parts were &quot;Que van a dar en la mar&quot; (a quotation from Jorge Manrique&#x27;s &quot;Coplas por la muerte de su padre&quot;) in 1960 and &quot;A la altura de las circunstancias&quot; in 1963. It is not clear when he started work on these collections. The long gap between the final edition of &quot;Cántico&quot; and the first volume of &quot;Clamor&quot; suggest that the bulk of the work was done in the 1950s especially in view of the number of poems that were added to the two later editions of &quot;Cántico&quot;.

This collection is almost the antithesis of &quot;Cántico&quot;. The continued optimism and delight in life that the poet had shown despite the upheavals in his personal life and the turmoil of world events must have begun to seem an inadequate response. So there are poems such as &quot;Los intranquilos&quot; which use much simpler, less distanced language and convey a sense of unease, dissatisfaction, uncertainty. In this poem, the only escape from all this is into the oblivion offered by drink or the television.
In &quot;Cántico&quot;, there were many poems about awakening and how wonderful it is to return into consciousness. In &quot;Clamor&quot;, dawn brings a desire to sink back into sleep and find oblivion. &quot;Del trascurso&quot; compares with &quot;Muerte a lo lejos&quot; from &quot;Cántico&quot; and not just because both poems are sonnets. In the earlier poem, death was somewhere in the future and life was to be enjoyed. In the later poem, the poet looks back to his past where the good memories are. He then clings to the present but cannot avoid the sense of a future that is shrinking every day.

In &quot;Viviendo&quot;, the poet is in the city, walking in the twilight surrounded by the hum of traffic. The poet feels part of a machine that is slowly ticking away time. He reaches the realization that the individual can die without the machine either slowing or stopping, regardless of whether the individual has completed his part of the work of that machine. As time goes by, the sight of tables on a café terrace remind him that there is after all a human component to this machine. The conclusion that emerges is again resignation to the inevitability of death but there is no sense of consolation, merely an unconvincing stoicism of a man journeying from nothingness to nothingness. It is a very different feel to &quot;A vista de hombre&quot;.

In &quot;Modo paterno&quot;, lacking any definite faith in God or an afterlife, the poet tells himself that something of his will be saved and projected into the future by his children. This belief acts as a counterbalance to the sadness and pessimism of most of the collection.

===Homenaje===

It seems that this collection, although published in 1967, gathers together poems written between 1949–66, so it overlaps with the final stages of the writing of &quot;Cántico&quot; as well as with &quot;Clamor&quot;. It contains much &quot;occasional&quot; poetry, recording Guillén&#x27;s readings, his friends, places visited, favourite painters etc. It also contains translations of French, Italian, German, English and Portuguese poetry. However, there are also more personal reflections. &quot;Al márgen de un Cántico&quot;, for example, shows his response to critics who had accused him of writing in abstractions – such as Juan Ramón Jiménez among others. &quot;Historia inconclusa&quot; recalls some of the writers who have meant most to him, including a subtle tribute to García Lorca. And there are also poems which show a new-found resignation or acceptance of life, free from the ambiguities and uncertainties of &quot;Viviendo&quot;.

Guillén gave the title &quot;Aire nuestro&quot; to the compilation of his three great poetry books prior to 1968. He would later publish &quot;Y otros poemas&quot; (1973) and &quot;Final&quot; (1982).

==Guillén and Salinas==

These two poets have often been compared to each other. To some extent this is because they were good friends and slightly older than most of the other leading members of their generation, as well as sharing similar career-paths, but they also seemed to share a similar approach to poetry. Their poems often have a rarefied quality and tend not to deal with &quot;particulars&quot;, readily identifiable people and places. However, they did differ in many respects as exemplified by the titles they gave to their published lectures on Spanish poetry. At Johns Hopkins, Salinas published a collection called &quot;Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry&quot;, whereas Guillén&#x27;s Norton lectures were called &quot;Language and Poetry&quot;. Both devoted single lectures to Góngora and San Juan de la Cruz and the comparisons between them are instructive. Salinas seems to want to show us the poetic reality behind or beyond appearances, to educate us into how to see whereas Guillén gives us an account of the thoughts and sense-impressions going through his own mind: the reader is a viewer of this process not a participant in it. Vicente Aleixandre recalled visiting Salinas and finding him at his desk with his daughter on one knee and his son on the other and stretching out a hand clutching a pen to shake hands with his visitor. Although he was also devoted to his family, Guillén probably worked in a secluded study.

<text>True Stories (full onscreen title: True Stories: A Film About a Bunch of People in Virgil Texas.) is a 1986 American satirical musical comedy film directed by David Byrne, who stars alongside John Goodman, Swoosie Kurtz, and Spalding Gray. The majority of the film&#x27;s music is supplied by Talking Heads. A soundtrack album, titled &quot;Sounds from True Stories&quot;, featured songs by Byrne, Talking Heads, Terry Allen &amp; The Panhandle Mystery Band, and others. Around the same time, Talking Heads released an album titled &quot;True Stories&quot;, composed of studio recordings of songs featured in the film.

&quot;True Stories&quot; was released by Warner Bros. in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Sweden in 1986, and received a limited release elsewhere the following year. Byrne was given much creative control over the motion picture&#x27;s direction, largely due to the mainstream success of Talking Heads&#x27; 1984 concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;. The resulting film is replete with Byrne&#x27;s eccentric and idiosyncratic observations of small-town life, exaggerated satirical imagery, and surrealist sense of humor.

==Plot==
The film is presented as a series of vignettes centered around Byrne as an unnamed, cowboy-hat-wearing stranger who visits the fictional Texas town of Virgil, where he observes the citizens as they prepare for the &quot;Celebration of Specialness&quot; to mark the 150th anniversary of Texas&#x27; independence. The event is being sponsored by the Varicorp Corporation, a local computer manufacturing plant. Among the many characters the visitor meets and interacts with, the most prominent are:
* Louis Fyne, a country-western-singing clean room technician at Varicorp who is unlucky in love
* Civic leader Earl Culver, who never speaks directly to his wife, Kay 
* Miss Rollings, who never leaves her bed
* Mr. Tucker, Miss Rollings&#x27; personal assistant, a kindly voodoo practitioner whom Louis hires to help him find love
* A conspiracy theorist preacher, whose shtick owes a great deal to the Church of the SubGenius
* Ramon, a Tejano singer who claims to hear tones from people
* &quot;The Lying Woman&quot;, who recounts fantastic episodes from her life to anyone who will listen

==Cast==
* David Byrne as The Narrator (also as the Lip-Syncher with mustache during the &quot;Wild Wild Life&quot; sequence)
* John Goodman as Louis Fyne
* Spalding Gray as Earl Culver
* Annie McEnroe as Kay Culver
* Swoosie Kurtz as Miss Rollings, The Lazy Woman
* Pops Staples as Mr. Tucker
* John Ingle as The Preacher
* Tito Larriva as Ramon
* Jo Harvey Allen as The Lying Woman
* Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison as Lip-Synchers (Wild Wild Life sequence).

==Production==
Byrne has stated that the decision to film in Texas was motivated in large part by investors in the project, due to anti-union right-to-work laws in the state, telling the Miami Herald in 1986: &quot;I first was lured there for financial reasons because it&#x27;s a right-to-work state, and they have experienced crews and a studio near Dallas.&quot;

Stephen Tobolowsky recounts in an episode of his podcast &quot;The Tobolowsky Files&quot; that he and his girlfriend Beth Henley met David Byrne and Talking Heads when Jonathan Demme invited them to a preview screening of &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;. Shortly afterward, Byrne invited Henley and Tobolowsky over to his house and showed them a collection of hundreds of drawings he had made and put up on his wall. He explained they were based on clippings he had scrapbooked from tabloids as the band had been on tour. He had been intrigued by the idea of making a film based on the premise, &quot;What if all these stories were true?&quot; and wanted Henley and Tobolowsky to write the script based on those drawings.

Tobolowsky was aware that Texas was coming up on its sesquicentennial celebration, and thought that would provide a good framework for the characters Byrne had invented. Henley and he wrote a draft and provided it to Byrne, then did not hear back from him for about a year. It later turned out that Byrne had rewritten their script almost entirely, keeping only a few lines and the sesquicentennial framework from the first draft. However, he asked Tobolowsky and Henley for permission to list their names ahead of his as scriptwriters so the film would seem less like a &quot;vanity project.&quot;

During Tobolowsky&#x27;s early talks with Byrne, he related to Byrne the story of a series of psychic experiences he had during college, in which he had been able to hear &quot;tones&quot; that told him things about other people. Byrne incorporated this story into his rewrite, using it as the basis for Ramon&#x27;s psychic powers and the song &quot;Radio Head.&quot;

An early working title for the project (endorsed by bassist Tina Weymouth) was &quot;Wild Infancy&quot;. Filming took place in Dallas and its suburbs Allen, McKinney, Mesquite, Midlothian and Red Oak. The interior mall and fashion show scene was filmed in NorthPark Center in North Dallas, and the exterior mall scene was filmed at the now-demolished Big Town Mall in Mesquite. The parade scene at the end of the film includes various local groups, including the Tejas Low Riders Club and the Sunset High School Marching Band.

==Reception==
&quot;True Stories&quot; was not a commercial success at the time of its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79%, based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Its kitschy leanings may wear thin on some, but &quot;True Stories&quot; is a disarmingly big-hearted, dreamy vision of Americana.&quot; Roger Ebert gave it a glowing review with a rating of 3.5/4 stars. It has achieved success in home video release as a cult classic among fans of Byrne&#x27;s work.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;True Stories&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #85, and stated that &quot;&quot;True Stories&quot; is a tour of Virgil, Texas, Byrne&#x27;s toytown utopia, whose peculiar citizens have neurosis down to a fine art. Zippy the Pinhead would be at home in Virgil.&quot;

===Home media===
In 1987, the film was released on VHS and Laserdisc. On March 30, 1999, it was released onto DVD. On November 27, 2018, The Criterion Collection released a DVD and Blu-ray of the film.

==Music==
&quot;True Stories&quot; features a number of songs written by Byrne and performed by various members of the cast as well as by Talking Heads (the members of which make cameo appearances).

Talking Heads released an album titled &quot;True Stories&quot; in which the band performs most of the songs from the film, including songs that were performed by the actors in the film. As such, the album is not generally considered a true soundtrack album, a fact Byrne points out in his liner notes on the release. Later, Byrne released an album containing primarily instrumental music from the soundtrack titled &quot;Sounds from True Stories&quot;.

While several of the cast performances were released as bonus tracks on 12-inch single releases, no full album of cast performances was released until 2018 (see below). Prior to 2018, few of the original versions of songs from the film found official release. The St. Thomas Aquinas School Choir&#x27;s version of &quot;Hey Now&quot; was released on the 1987 Talking Heads UK CD single, &quot;Radio Head&quot;; the Pops Staples version of &quot;Papa Legba&quot; and Tito Larriva&#x27;s version of &quot;Radio Head&quot; appear as extra tracks on the 2006 Rhino reissue of &quot;True Stories&quot;; and John Goodman&#x27;s version of &quot;People Like Us&quot; was initially released as the B-side to the single for &quot;Wild Wild Life&quot; and later was released on the 2006 digital compilation &quot;Bonus Rarities and Outtakes&quot;, but the rest of the songs whose versions differ between the movie and album (John Ingle&#x27;s &quot;Puzzling Evidence&quot; and Annie McEnroe&#x27;s &quot;Dream Operator&quot;) were not officially available. &quot;Cocktail Desperado&quot;, recorded by Terry Allen and the Panhandle Mystery Band and featured in the film, is included on the &quot;Sounds from True Stories&quot; LP.

The music video version of &quot;Wild Wild Life&quot; that debuted on MTV is largely a scene taken from the film, in which many of the film&#x27;s characters (including John Goodman) lip-synch to the music in a night club; the video version is more risque and features more pop music references/parodies than seen in the film; the Prince and Billy Idol parodies remain in the film version. Similarly, the video for &quot;Love for Sale&quot; is the same as that seen in the film (in which Kurtz&#x27;s character is shown watching it on TV) except the video version has additional footage of Talking Heads, more references to recognizable TV commercials of the day, and no intercuts to any of the film characters.

In November 2018, &quot;True Stories, A Film by David Byrne: The Complete Soundtrack&quot;, a comprehensive soundtrack album with 23 songs as they were recorded for the film, was released. This marked the first time that the complete &quot;True Stories&quot; soundtrack was made publicly available, 32 years after the movie&#x27;s original release. The soundtrack was issued to coincide with Criterion&#x27;s 2018 DVD and Blu-ray release of the film, the latter of which it was also packaged with. The new-edition soundtrack includes the three Talking Heads performances with David Byrne on lead vocals that are featured in the movie, &quot;Wild Wild Life,&quot; &quot;Love for Sale,&quot; and &quot;City of Dreams&quot;, which are the same recordings included on the Talking Heads album True Stories; otherwise, the material does not overlap with the Talking Heads album. The new edition includes the first official commercial release of McEnroe&#x27;s &quot;Dream Operator&quot; and Ingle&#x27;s &quot;Puzzlin&#x27; Evidence&quot;.

==Legacy==
English rock band Radiohead is named after the song &quot;Radio Head&quot; from &quot;True Stories&quot;.

<text>Hod Hill (or Hodd Hill) is a large hill fort in the Blackmore Vale, north-west of Blandford Forum, Dorset, England. The fort sits on a chalk hill of the same name that lies between the adjacent Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase. The hill fort at Hambledon Hill is just to the north. The name probably comes from Old English &quot;hod&quot;, meaning a shelter, though &quot;hod&quot; could also mean &quot;hood&quot;, referring to the shape of the hill.

The fort is roughly rectangular (), with an enclosed area of . There is a steep natural slope down to the River Stour to the west, the other sides have an artificial rampart, ditch and counterscarp (outer bank), with an additional rampart on the north side. The main entrance is at the south-east corner, with other openings at the south-west and north-east corners.
The hillfort was inhabited by the Durotriges in the late Iron Age; whether this is the same tribe who fortified the hilltop in the middle Iron Age (radiocarbon analysis suggests a date of 500 BC for the main rampart) is unknown. There is extensive evidence of settlement within the fort, including platforms for roundhouses.

Hod Hill is the second in a series of Iron Age earthworks, starting from Hambledon Hill, and including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final Iron Age monument in this small chain of sites.

Although it is traditionally thought that the hill was captured in AD 43 by the Roman Second Legion (Augusta), led by Vespasian, who by then had already captured Maiden Castle and other hill forts to the south, this interpretation now seems unlikely. It is clear that the hillfort had long been abandoned by the time the Roman army arrived in Dorset, the many iron ballista bolts which have been found across the hill, clustered in the so-called &quot;Chieftain&#x27;s hut&quot; area (two hut circles, one of which had an enclosure around it) are now more likely viewed as having been fired from the later Roman fort during target practice.

The Romans built a camp () in the north-west corner of the original fort, possibly occupied by a mixed force of legionaries and auxiliaries. The fort was used as a base for about 5 or 6 years, but passed out of use by about AD 50, when troops were withdrawn, after a fire, for the campaigns against Caractacus in Wales, and the remaining men were moved to a new fort further west at Waddon Hill.
The site was excavated in the 1950s by Sir Ian Richmond and his final report was published in 1969. Today the hill is an important calcareous grassland habitat, home to spectacular wild flowers and butterflies. The hillfort is a Scheduled Monument which is in the care of the National Trust with public access. The site was on the Heritage at Risk Register but was removed in 2022 as a result of the Hillforts and Habitats Project.

<text>Telekom Malaysia Berhad or simply TM is a Malaysian telecommunications company that was founded in 1984. Beginning as the national telecommunications company for fixed line, radio, and television broadcasting services, it has evolved to become the country&#x27;s largest provider of broadband services, data, fixed line, pay television, and network services. TM ventured into the LTE space with the launch of TMgo, its 4G offering. TM&#x27;s 850 MHz service was rebranded as unifi Mobile in January 2018.

TM represents one of the largest government-linked companies in the country, with more than 28,000 employees and a market capitalisation of more than RM25 billion.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years ===

Much of the telecommunications infrastructure in Malaysia was damaged during the Second World War and the Japanese occupation. In 1946, when the British re-established their position in Malaya, they repaired the trunk routes, restored fallen telephone poles and installed the copper wires that had either been damaged or stolen. During the Japanese occupation, the Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department was split into two separate units. When the British returned, they initially re-united the two entities, but this effort was short-lived. Along with the formation of the Malayan Union on 1 April 1946, the Malaysian Telecommunications Department and the Postal Services Department were born, with the former controlling telegraph, telephone and wireless services and the latter overlooking mail, money orders and savings accounts.

During the emergency (1948-1960), there was a strong focus on providing communications links for the police and armed forces. This included the installation of radio stations in the jungle as well as very high frequency (VHF) radiotelephony over the normal state network. By 1953, all hill stop stations required for the police VHF network were completed, enabling every police station and police vehicle to communicate with headquarters and with each other. The police radio services were thought to be the largest scheme of its kind in the world.

At the same time, despite the Occupation, commercial activities began to flourish and demand for telecommunications services increased greatly. This necessitated a third floor to be built at the telephone exchange building in Kuala Lumpur. Along with the issue of 10 cent coins, phone booths began to spring up in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. From 1950 to 1953, the department&#x27;s revenue more than doubled from $8 million to $17 million as the number of telephones installed rose from 20,000 to 39,000. Accordingly, the trunk and junction networks expanded, and the number of radio stations grew by 10 times to more than 1,000. In 1953, too, the Penang Auto Exchange was opened catering for 5,000 lines. In 1954, the Main Trunk Route linking Singapore to Malacca, Kuala Lumpur and Penang was completed. Satellite exchanges began to emerge. During this period, international connections have also increased, linking Malaysia with the rest of the world.

As independence became imminent, a comprehensive Malayanisation programme was embarked on to ensure the department would continue to be run by capable local personnel. From as early as 1954, no less than 21 Malaysians were pursuing studies in telecommunications related areas in Britain and Australia. Their numbers were boosted by youth enrolling at the Department&#x27;s Gracelyn Training School.

=== Growth ===

Following the country&#x27;s Independence in 1957, the Malayan Telecommunications Department was renamed Jabatan Telekom. One of its first tasks was to provide telecommunications facilities throughout the nation, as part of the Rural Development Plan. Microwave radio links were established which, by 1962, covered most urban centres in Peninsular Malaysia. In 1962, too, the Government took control of international calls from Cable &amp; Wireless, which had been operating Malaysia&#x27;s overseas telecommunications services for almost 10 years. Subscriber trunk dialling (STD) was introduced, enabling telephone owners in Kuala Lumpur to call Singapore directly, without having to go through an operator, using the first long-distance microwave link. Overseas calls were further enhanced with the roll-out of SEACOM, which formed part of the Commonwealth Cable Scheme. In 1961, the Federation of Malaya and Singapore became partners in this initiative, with Malaya investing about $12 million in it. The first phase of SEACOM between Singapore and Jesselton (Kota Kinabalu), in Sabah, was opened on 15 January 1964. On 30 March 1967, the entire system was commissioned.

The expanding microwave network enabled Jabatan Telekom to launch television services in Peninsular Malaysia in 1963, using the same system. While Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) controlled the content of local TV, Jabatan Telekom managed the transmission of microwaves from the studio to homes.

As prior to 1963, Sabah and Sarawak were not part of the Federation of Malaya, telecommunications services in these East Malaysia states were managed independently, by the Telecommunications Department of Sabah and Sarawak. In 1968, this department merged with that of Peninsular Malaysia to form the Telecommunications Department of Malaysia.

In 1970, further expanding Malaysia&#x27;s international connectivity, an earth satellite station was built near Kuantan for communications via the Indian Ocean Intelsat III satellite. The station, costing $9 million, was completed in a record 12 months by a fully local team. The station was to serve primarily external telephone, telegraph and telex communications, however it also enhanced the reception of international television programmes.

In 1975, the International Telex Exchange was opened, allowing businesses to send telexes. Four years later, International Direct Dialling (IDD) services were introduced and the first electronic exchange was commissioned in Johor Bahru. The volume of new development was such that, in the early 1980s, the department was compelled to appoint contractors to help build new lines and extend the cable network.

In terms of systems, the year 1985 was a watershed. This was when Automatic Telephone Using Radio (ATUR) 450 – the earliest precursor in Malaysia to today&#x27;s mobile service – was introduced. The service provided almost universal coverage with the installation of five mobile telephone exchanges and many radio base stations.

In line with the Government&#x27;s privatisation agenda, and in recognition of the benefits Jabatan Telekom would enjoy unencumbered by policies and budgets, steps towards this end were embarked on beginning in 1985. On 1 January 1987, a corporatised Syarikat Telekom Malaysia (STM) was born, under the Telecommunications Service (Successor Company) Act 1985. The company was immediately faced with various challenges including a huge debt, inventories that had been unused for years and a workforce that still operated on a civil servant mentality. Although the company embarked on a comprehensive programme to transform the organisation, with a strong focus on customer service, the results took time. Some disgruntled customers even suggested that competition be allowed in the industry to improve standards.

Challenges aside, STM continued to adopt new technologies as they emerged and to offer these to its customer base. Corporate Information Superhighway (COINS) was launched, a globally linked fibre optic backbone capable of transmitting digital signals at 10 Mbit/s, which was among the fastest of such service in the world. At the same time, the process of transforming the Main Trunk Route network from analogue to digital began, and was completed by 2000. This transformation received a boost once the RM150 million Kuantan-Kota Kinabalu submarine fibre optic cable became operational. For the first time, too, STM invested in a new optical fibre submarine cable system linking Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. Each optic fibre in the cable system could carry traffic at 560 Mbit/s, equivalent to 30,000 simultaneous phone calls.

The next logical step to buffer its finances was to undergo a listing. STM was listed on 7 November 1990, achieving a market value of RM27 billion or 10% of the total market capitalisation of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (now Bursa Malaysia). The volume of trading was such that KLSE had to suspend activity on the stock for 10 minutes to prevent its system from jamming, as it was unable to handle the sheer number of incoming orders.

Following its listing, STM has evolved to be known as Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TMB), and the Company pushed ahead with new products to increase its subscriber base, launching services such as TELECAJ, a billing option for those who travelled a great deal; Malaysia Direct for those travelling overseas; and Telestock, a dial-up facility to retrieve up-to-date share prices. In 1992, it introduced video conferencing facilities nationwide as well as Centrex, a virtual PABX system that allows larger organisations the option of functioning without operators, enabling customers to reach staff directly. In 1993, the nationwide digital transmission network and the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) pilot projects were completed.

=== Cellular Mobile Services ===

Even before listing, STM had entered into a partnership with the Fleet Holdings to launch Celcom, the country&#x27;s first private mobile system (ART 900) using Ericsson&#x27;s Total Access Communication System (TACS). Private mobile systems were needed to supplement ATUR, which could no longer handle the volume of traffic it was receiving. Not long after, STM divested its 51% stake in Celcom to Alpine Resources, to start its own mobile enterprise based on the US-based Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS). Subsequently, the Government handed out six Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) licences, but none of these were to STM. It was only in 1996 that STM was able to introduce its 1800 MHz digital TMTOUCH cellular service. In 2003, TMTOUCH merged with Celcom to form the country&#x27;s largest cellular operator. Two years later, this cellular operator launched the country&#x27;s first 3G service.

Meanwhile, TMB also ventured into the mobile business overseas and it obtained its first GSM licence in Sri Lanka in 1994. This was followed by licences in India and Ghana, although it relinquished its businesses in these countries within a couple of years due to political circumstances. Undeterred, TMB continued to make forays abroad and, by 2000, had a presence in South Africa, Guinea, Malawi, Cambodia, Thailand and Bangladesh. Eventually the company decided to consolidate its investments overseas and concentrate on markets closer to home. Thus by 2004, its mobile international presence was concentrated in Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Iran and Pakistan. In 2005, TMB underwent a major rebranding as TM. At the end of 2007, TM&#x27;s total international cellular subscriber base stood at 30.3 million.

=== Demerger ===
In 2007, TM began the process of demerger to separate its mobile and fixed line services into two distinct entities. The exercise, one of the major influxes in the company&#x27;s history, was completed in April 2008, resulting in TM continuing to manage its domestic fixed line and broadband services; and TM International Berhad (TMI), a newly formed company, assuming control of TM&#x27;s regional mobile services. TMI subsequently underwent a rebranding and on 2 April 2009 was renamed Axiata.

However, TM will return to mobile business via its subsidiary P1 on Q2 2016, after signing a 5-year domestic roaming agreement with Celcom on 28 January 2016. TM had already operating 4G FDD LTE on 850 MHz band and planned to do so by using 2600 MHz TDD LTE band which is owned by its subsidiary P1.

=== Return to wireless ===
==== TM Net ====

In 1995, TMB was awarded a licence to become the second Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the country, the first being MIMOS with its service, Jaring. TM Net, as TMB&#x27;s service was called, marked the beginning of TMB&#x27;s transformation into an integrated telecommunications service provider. One of its first developments towards this end was the introduction of COINS, a multimedia networking solution based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology. This was seen as one of several prerequisites for the successful implementation of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).

==== Streamyx ====

Building up its data offerings, in 2001 TMB launched Streamyx, its first broadband service for the general population and BlueHyppo.com, a lifestyle internet portal. In the same year, TM Net was acknowledged as the largest ISP in Southeast Asia; and the company also launched CDMA fixed wireless telephony.

==== UNIFI ====

On 24 March 2010, unifi, the nation&#x27;s first HSBB service, was launched. unifi is a combination of internet, voice and IPTV service (known as HyppTV). By the end of 2012, TM had deployed the HSBB network to 1.377 million premises, on schedule and below budget. Last mile access to homes and businesses is being achieved by fibre-to-the home (FTTH), ethernet-to-the-home (ETTH), and very high-speed digital subscriber line 2 (VDSL2). BT Teleconsult, a UK-based telco consulting firm, has credited the HSBB network roll-out as one of the fastest and lowest cost in the world.

As of June 2015, TM had 2.9 million broadband customers, of whom 51% are on high speed broadband. The number of unifi subscribers as of June 2015 was close to 782,000, representing a take-up rate of approximately 46%. As at November 2015, HyppTV offered a total of 124 channels with 49 channels in high definition (HD) – consisting of 57 premium channels, 22 free channels, five Radio channels, 15 video on demand (VOD) channels and 25 interactive channels in a variety of packages or via à la carte options.

In 2015, TM had been awarded with phase 2 of the High Speed Broadband (HSBB2) project as well as the Sub Urban Broadband (SUBB) Project by the Government, to deploy domestic core networks to deliver end-to-end broadband network infrastructure and services.

Unifi are one of the most slowest ISP in Malaysia, TM misrepresented broadband speeds for its home internet plans. It stated that there are 200 MBPS of upload speed available to customer but in fact there are only 100 MBPS to customer. This is counted as an illegal action by the ISP in Malaysia. Unifi still claim that there are some typo on the promotional banner, but this is not acceptable for the largest ISP in Malaysia.

Available unifi internet plans:
=== UNIFI Mobile ===
In January 2018, TM relaunched it mobile service as one unifi Mobile brand. unifi Mobile basically is a prepaid plan featured with no expiry as long the user stayed active. unifi mobile LTE network consists of 850 MHz FDD-LTE (Band 5), 2300 MHz TD-LTE (Band40) and TD-LTE 2600 MHz (Band 38). unifi mobile utilizes its TMgo 850 MHz LTE band 5 spectrum (refarmed from CDMA 850 MHz), and Celcom provides domestic roaming on 3G and 2G. On the 2.3 GHz WiMAX and 2.6 GHz LTE bands, TM rebranded P1 to webe in 2014 after the acquisition.

=== TM One ===

In August 2017, as part of its new execution approach, TM consolidated its enterprise and public sector operations, which includes its ICT and data services unit and rebranded them into a new brand “TM One”.

== Operations ==
With the reconsolidation of TM&#x27;s businesses in August 2017, TM&#x27;s three customer-focused clusters are unifi, TM ONE and TM GLOBAL.

=== TM GLOBAL ===
