<text>Air pollution is a concern in British Columbia, Canada because of its effects on health and visibility. Air quality is influenced in British Columbia (BC) by numerous mountain ranges and valleys, which complicate atmospheric pollution dispersion and can lead to high concentrations of pollutants such as particulate matter from wood smoke (especially during stagnant atmospheric conditions/inversions). 

==Air quality in BC==
Air quality in much of BC is good compared to many areas of North America. This is particularly true for cities in BC such as the Greater Vancouver area and Victoria.

Valley communities such as Golden may experience periods of poor air quality, particularly during stagnant atmospheric conditions. Two communities currently exceed the federal standards for maximum safe levels of pollutants: Prince George for particulate matter (PM2.5), and the community of Hope in the lower Fraser Valley for ozone. Other communities are close to the PM2.5 standard, such as Quesnel, Kamloops, Chiliwack, and Langley.

Hourly air quality monitoring results are available for the lower Fraser Valley. Air quality information is available for the rest of the province from the Ministry of the Environment. The BC Lung Association produces an annual State of the Air Report for BC. This report is a collaboration between the provincial, federal and regional governments responsible for air quality management in BC.

An important recent consideration is the nearly complete replacement of the TEOM (Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance) pollution measurement instruments once relied on by BC with newer SHARP FEM (Federal Equivalency Method) monitors. The TEOMs often under-reported particulate matter measurements by 50%. A process of colocation and auditing of operations will make the new and higher readings more reliable. A more complete understanding of conditions will lead to a greater understanding of likely impacts and may drive increased regulatory efforts.

These measurements sample ambient air – that is, air where people might breathe it – and are usually reliable and available. They do not include the air in workplaces. A possibly trickier assessment is determining where pollution comes from, often a question addressed by emissions inventories. In BC and other Canadian jurisdictions, facilities are required to report their toxic substance emissions to Environment Canada on an annual basis. Self-reporting tends to lead to under-reporting, notwithstanding which the inventory resulting tracks releases in an interesting way. At the NPRI we can see a complex example in the historical report summary of Canfor&#x27;s NPRI reporting in recent years. Criticisms of such reporting has been done by Scott Vaughan, Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment in his Fall 2009 report.

It is worth noting that the government only recently began addressing air quality when the problem was increasingly associated with health issues and generated complaints about smog and poor visibility. There is no major agency for air quality at the provincial and federal levels. The BC Ministry of Environment added a branch in 1980 for air quality and it received a small budget annually for almost a decade. After the 1990s, resources allocated to air quality grew rapidly and this was particularly the case for the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) through its air management plan.

==Sources of air pollution==
Air pollution sources in British Columbia may be divided between those external to the province, such as transboundary pollution, and those internal to it; and between anthropogenic (man-made) sources and natural sources. External anthropogenic sources include combustion particles and gases from industrial sources in the province of Alberta or the U.S. state of Washington. Toxic substances form part of these pollutants such as tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene as well as nitrogen monoxide and sulfur dioxide, which Canada seeks to minimize through caps and its tradable permit system. Mount St. Helens has been a significant external natural source: although located entirely in the United States, its eruption created air pollution in parts of British Columbia.

Exhaust from internal combustion engines (mainly automobiles and trucks, as well as marine vessels in coastal waters) is a major internal anthropogenic source. Other human-caused sources include: Industrial, agricultural (e.g. manure spreading), commercial operations (e.g., dry cleaners and gas stations) and home heating appliances (furnaces, fireplaces). Radionuclides are generally not a concern with regards to air pollution issues in BC, except for radon gas. Background pollution occurs in areas not directly affected by pollution sources.

==Pollution law==
The Canadian Constitution does not clearly specify the level of government that has responsibility for environmental protection in Canada. As such, pollution law in British Columbia is divided among local, regional, provincial, federal and international jurisdictions, each with its own focus and, at times, overlapping concerns. Legislation may be enacted at any of these levels.

=== Provincial air quality law ===
Provincial environmental regulation is largely contained in BC&#x27;s Environmental Management Act, which defines an air contaminant as follows:

&quot;air contaminant&quot; means a substance that is introduced into the air and that

* (a) injures or is capable of injuring the health or safety of a person,
* (b) injures or is capable of injuring property or any life form,
* (c) interferes with or is capable of interfering with visibility,
* (d) interferes with or is capable of interfering with the normal conduct of business,
* (e) causes or is capable of causing material physical discomfort to a person, or
* (f) damages or is capable of damaging the environment;&quot;

The EMA is the enabling legislation for BC&#x27;s industrial emissions permits.

=== Federal air quality law ===
Federal pollution law is largely embodied in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) and its associated schedules. The act of scheduling a toxin under CEPA starts a process of elimination or virtual elimination from the Canadian environment.

The National Pollutant Release Inventory indexes sources by pollutant and location.

In 2012 the CCME started the Air Quality Management System process. This provided for the evaluation of PM and ozone measurements at many sites in BC and across Canada. In 2015 the first air zone reports for BC were published. They show that Houston, Smithers, and Vanderhoof are not meeting the PM2.5 standard. This is a trigger for corrective intervention. The exact type of intervention is not yet determined, partly because it&#x27;s a new process and partly because of variable site-specific factors. It&#x27;s not likely that one size fits all in correction.

Pollution law governing emissions from marine vessels is complicated; Transport Canada holds primary authority for regulating ship traffic in Canada, while the International Maritime Organization governs global shipping rules (including pollution from marine vessels). Environment Canada and other agencies are working to better understand and address this issue, which is increasingly important due to growing international trade.

=== Regional and municipal air quality law ===
Within the province, various Regional Districts and municipalities have enacted laws to control pollution. There are also area-based plans to manage pollution along geographic lines that recognize airsheds instead of political boundaries. This system is especially relevant to BC because of its mountainous topography. The BC Environmental Management Act recognizes airsheds and notes that managers under the Act &quot;may give consideration&quot; to them, but their full legal status is uncertain. Some plans have had a considerable effect, and this trend is likely to continue.

The Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) has a clearly defined role in air pollution control and has delegated authority from the province (Montreal is the only other jurisdiction in Canada with this delegated authority). The Fraser Valley Regional District has delegated authority to plan but not manage air quality.

British Columbia is a participant in the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), which includes processes for fine particulates and ground-level ozone. Because BC generally has lower levels of pollution than the standards set by the Environmental Protection Act, the CI/KCAC (&quot;Continuous Improvement&quot; and &quot;Keeping Clean Areas Clean&quot;) principle of the federal strategy is of special importance.

International law and treaties such as the Kyoto Accord further affect air pollution in BC.

The precautionary principle embodied in international agreements is gaining recognition in Canada and BC as a guide to interpreting pollution law. Its exact application is uncertain but it is cited in the preamble to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act as a principle guiding the Government of Canada.

==Health effects==
The health effects of air pollution vary with the size and characteristics of the exposed population, the specific pollutant or mix of pollutants and the concentration of pollutants, both in the short term and the long term. Children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing health problems are known to be especially vulnerable. Generally speaking, respiratory and cardiac effects are the most significant, but there is increasing evidence that air pollutants play a role in cancer and genetic mutations, some of which can be inherited. Cumulative and synergistic effects are hard to study: ethical concerns rule out some otherwise desirable experimental procedures, and multi-pollutant studies are complex and expensive, leaving these areas less well understood experimentally. Sometimes ecologic studies can contribute to our understanding of combined effects. In the early 1990s, the province commissioned Dr. Sverre Vedal, then a researcher at the University of British Columbia, to investigate air pollution in BC, and to assess and to rank its health impacts. His report concluded that particulate pollution was the gravest concern, estimating an annual toll of 82 deaths, among other consequences. As of late 2004, the province continues its long-term effort to control sources of particulates. The varying population and topography have given rise to different problems in different areas, necessitating differing approaches. Other important air pollutants are oxides of nitrogen and of sulphur, volatile organic compounds of various kinds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans. Exposure and health effects of these vary by area and sometimes by season.

Recent air pollution research in Canada and other jurisdictions was summarized by Health Canada in October 2003 in its report &quot;Human Health Effects of Fine Particulate Matter&quot;, which has informed standards-setting deliberations of the CCME. Research in British Columbia has been ongoing since at least 1990. The BC Lung Association has commissioned work in this field, including a 2003 analysis by Dr. David Bates and others, &quot;Health and Air Quality 2002—Phase 1&quot;. The second phase of this report was to deal with health effects of fine particulates in northern BC communities, where biomass combustion is arguably the most important source. Ray Copes and Catherine Elliott estimated mortality in northern BC in their report.

At the end of 2004, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Perry Kendall released his annual report titled &quot;Air Quality in British Columbia, A Public Health Perspective&quot;. It includes estimates of the health impact of air pollution in BC. He estimates that 71–110 deaths are attributable to air pollution. This figure excludes effects of indoor air pollution and environmental tobacco smoke exposure.

On a national and regional scale, the Canadian Medical Association in 2008 quantified the &quot;illness costs of air pollution&quot;. The report includes business-as-usual projections of the increased burden in the coming decades.

==Air Quality Health Index==

The Air Quality Health Index, or AQHI, is a scale designed to help understand the impact of air quality on health. It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution. The Air Quality Health Index also provides advice on how to improve air quality by proposing a behavioral change to reduce the ecological footprint. This index pays particular attention to people who are sensitive to air pollution. It provides them with advice on how to protect their health during air quality levels associated with low, moderate, high, and very high health risks.

The Air Quality Health Index, or &quot;AQHI&quot;, is a federal program jointly coordinated by Health Canada and Environment Canada. However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities, and NGOs. From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work-related to AQHI implementation.

Originally launched as a pilot project in the British Columbia Interior and Nova Scotia in 2005, it is currently implemented in 49 locations across Canada.

The &quot;Air Quality Health Index&quot; provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight, and tomorrow and provides associated health advice.


As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as &#x27;low&#x27;, &#x27;moderate&#x27;, &#x27;high&#x27; or &#x27;very high&#x27;, and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure.

<text>John Dempsey O&#x27;Shea (20 June 1920 – 8 July 2001) was a New Zealand independent filmmaker; he was a director, producer, writer and actor. He produced the only three feature films that were made in New Zealand between 1940 and 1970.

== Early life ==
New Plymouth is where O&#x27;Shea was born in 1920. His parents were both of Irish Catholic ancestry, his mother, Norah Frances Dempsey, was born in New Zealand and his father, John Joseph O’Shea, was from County Limerick, Ireland. He had three older siblings. He grew up in New Plymouth and Whanganui and then went to study in Wellington at Victoria University College where he got involved with a film society. He also studied at Christchurch Teachers&#x27; Training College, and in 1942 served in the New Zealand Army for two years during World War II with the ambulance corps in the Pacific and Italy.

== Career ==
He was active from 1940 to 1970, and in 1952 set up Pacific Films in Wellington with Roger Mirams. He produced numerous short films and the three New Zealand feature films made in that period: &quot;Broken Barrier&quot; (1952) with Roger Mirams, &quot;Runaway&quot; (1964), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Get You&quot; (1966) for which he is most remembered.

O&#x27;Shea was involved with the &quot;Tangata Whenua: People of the Land&quot; (1974) a six part television documentary series directed by New Zealand&#x27;s first Māori screen director Barry Barclay. Other films he produced included are &quot;Pictures&quot; (1981), &quot;Among the Cinders&quot; (1983), &quot;Leave All Fair&quot; (1985) and &quot;Ngati&quot; (1987). He appeared in the spoof &quot;Forgotten Silver&quot; (1995).

Part of his legacy was the many people who Pacific Films gave valuable experiences to and went on to have notable careers such as Barry Barclay and Gaylene Preston. The tearooms at Pacific Films was described as &quot;the venue for debate and argument with O&#x27;Shea promoting a lively, stimulating environment where success was measured in ideas, not seniority.&quot;

O&#x27;Shea was a lecturer, research historian, and assistant film censor and was a founding member of the New Zealand Film Archive in 1981.

== Awards ==
In the 1990 New Year Honours, O&#x27;Shea was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the film industry. Also in 1990 he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal for services to the film industry. In 1992 he received the New Zealand Film Commission Lifetime Achievement Award.

== Personal life ==
In 1946 O&#x27;Shea and Jean Cormie Douglas got married in Christchurch on 20 April, they settled in Wellington. They had three children together, Patrick, Rory and Kathy who all went on to work in the film industry.

<doc id="1142247" wikidata="Q370741" url="?curid=1142247" title="Edson Buddle">
<text>Edson Michael Buddle (born May 21, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player who is currently the head coach of USL League Two side Westchester Flames. He is one of only 13 players to have scored 100 goals in Major League Soccer history.

A forward, Buddle began his career in North America in 2000 with the Long Island Rough Riders, who played in the A-League at that time. He then spent 2001 to 2010 in Major League Soccer, playing for the Columbus Crew, New York Red Bulls, Toronto FC, and LA Galaxy. After a one-year stint with FC Ingolstadt 04 in Germany&#x27;s 2. Bundesliga he returned to Los Angeles. Buddle has also played for the United States national team, including two appearances at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==

===College and Minor-League Career===
Born in New Rochelle, New York, Buddle played one year of college soccer at State Fair Community College, leading them to the 1999 NJCAA Division I National Championship. Buddle began his professional career in 2000, when he signed with Long Island Rough Riders of the A-League. Buddle helped the team win the Northeast Division, scoring eleven goals and four assists, and was a finalist for the A-League Rookie of the Year Award.

===Columbus Crew===
His performance in the A-League attracted the interest of MLS, and Edson was selected twenty-seventh overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by Columbus Crew. Buddle played only 556 minutes in his first year, but scored three goals and two assists. The next year, at the age of twenty-one, he scored nine goals and five assists in only 1304 minutes while helping the Crew to a U.S. Open Cup win. Plagued by injuries, he only started sixteen games the next year, but scored nine goals and four assists. The pattern repeated itself in 2004, as Buddle missed significant time to injury, but still scored eleven goals and two assists in twenty starts. His 2005 totals were nine goals and two assists.

===New York Red Bulls===
Before the 2006 season Buddle was traded to New York Red Bulls for Eddie Gaven and Chris Leitch. He had a disappointing year in his tenure with the team only scoring six goals because he was battling a foot injury. On November 22, 2006, Buddle was traded to Toronto FC for Tim Regan. He failed to score in 10 appearances for the Reds but assisted on the club&#x27;s first ever goal, setting up Danny Dichio to score against Chicago Fire in front of the south stand at BMO Field.

===Los Angeles Galaxy===
On June 13, 2007, Buddle was traded to LA Galaxy for Tyrone Marshall. He scored his first goal for the Galaxy against Real Salt Lake.

Buddle was not expected to be a starting striker as the 2008 MLS season began, as the Galaxy already had three attacking forwards in Carlos Ruiz, Landon Donovan and Alan Gordon. In spite of this, Buddle became a prominent striker on the LA offense in 2008, filling in for the injured Guatemalan striker Ruiz or when Donovan and Ruiz were absent while on international duty.

He scored two hat tricks during his first season in Los Angeles: one in Week 8 against FC Dallas and one in Week 12 against San Jose Earthquakes, winning the MLS Player of the Week in both weeks. After his second hat trick, teammate David Beckham commented, &quot;Edson is an individual who is getting better at the game. He&#x27;s proved that tonight.&quot; After scoring his ninth goal against Columbus Crew on June 22, 2008, coach Ruud Gullit said he had become a &quot;true professional&quot; and that he was &quot;very pleased&quot; with him. ESPN&#x27;s Andrea Canales noted that Buddle had once suffered from a reputation of being &quot;maddeningly lazy at times, giving up on passes that didn&#x27;t fall in his striking-sweet zone,&quot; but that he had improved due to guidance from Beckham and an improved self-confidence as he scored more goals. MLS Extratime&#x27;s Shep Messing said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better tandem up top than Landon Donovan and Edson Buddle...They complement each other. They don&#x27;t take away each other&#x27;s space, making it better for each other.&quot;

After scoring just five goals in the 2009 season, Buddle opened the 2010 season on fire, scoring seven goals in the first four matches of the year. By mid-May, he had scored nine times, earning a surprising call-up to the national team roster for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He continued his strong form after returning from the World Cup, continuing to lead the league in scoring when the 2010 MLS All-Star Game rosters were announced despite having missed several matches on international duty. On October 24, 2010, Los Angeles Galaxy won the Western Conference and the Supporter&#x27;s Shield, with Buddle winning the Galaxy&#x27;s MVP, golden boot, and Humanitarian of the Year.

===FC Ingolstadt 04===
Buddle signed with 2. Bundesliga club FC Ingolstadt 04 on January 10, 2011. He debuted for Ingolstadt on January 21 in a 1–1 draw against MSV Duisburg. He scored his first goal for the Bavarian side in the 78th minute of that game. Buddle was released by FC Ingolstadt 04 on January 31, 2012, making him a free agent.

===Return to Los Angeles Galaxy and Colorado Rapids===
Despite trialing with Everton the day after being released by Ingolstadt, Buddle re-signed with Los Angeles Galaxy. His second stint with the club proved disappointing and short-lived. Buddle started only 10 league games in 2012 and scored only 3 goals, his lowest season tally in MLS since his rookie year of 2001.

On December 14, 2012, Colorado Rapids acquired Buddle from Los Angeles in exchange for allocation money and a first-round pick in the 2013 MLS Supplemental Draft. On August 21, 2014, Buddle became only the eighth player to score 100 goals in MLS by heading in Dillon Powers&#x27; corner kick, albeit in a 3–4 home defeat to the Galaxy.

Buddle was released by Colorado on November 25, 2014. He returned to a third spell at the Galaxy on March 6, 2015. Buddle became a free agent on December 7, 2015, when the Galaxy declined his option.

==International career==
Although he may have been a promising player for the United States national team, Buddle&#x27;s injuries have made it difficult for him to break into the squad. He figured for the under-20 and under-23 teams, playing in the 2001 World Youth Championship with the former. Buddle earned his first senior team cap on March 29, 2003, in a friendly against Venezuela but would not see the field for the United States again for seven years. On May 11, 2010, he was named to the preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and on May 25, started in a 4–2 friendly loss to the Czech Republic. The following day, Buddle was named to the final squad. Buddle contributed two first-half goals in a friendly match versus Australia on June 5. In the 2010 FIFA World Cup he appeared as a substitute in matches against England and Algeria.

<doc id="1142250" wikidata="Q6183376" url="?curid=1142250" title="Jerry Clower">
<text>Howard Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Clower (September 28, 1926 – August 24, 1998) was an American stand-up comedian. Born and raised in the state of Mississippi, Clower was best known for his stories of the rural South and was given the nickname &quot;The Mouth of Mississippi&quot;.

==Life==
Clower was born in Liberty, Mississippi and began a two-year stint in the Navy after graduating from high school in 1944. Upon his discharge, in 1946, he was a Radioman Third Class (RMN3) and had earned the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with two bronze service stars), and the World War II Victory Medal.

He studied agriculture at Mississippi State University, where he played college football and was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. After finishing school in 1951, Clower worked as a county agent and later as a seed salesman. He became a fertilizer salesman for Mississippi Chemical in 1954.

==Career==
By 1954, Clower had developed a reputation for telling funny stories to boost his sales. Tapes of Clower&#x27;s speaking engagements wound up in the hands of Edwin &quot;Big Ed&quot; Wilkes and Bud Andrews in Lubbock, Texas, who had him make a better-quality recording which they promoted. MCA Records later awarded &quot;The Coon Hunt&quot; a platinum record for sales in excess of $1 million at the retail level.

At first, Clower took orders at his speaking engagements, selling 8000 copies on the Lemon record label. In time, Wilkes sent a copy to Grant Turner at WSM radio in Nashville, and when Turner played it on the air, Clower said &quot;that thing busted loose.&quot; MCA was soon knocking on Clower&#x27;s door, offering him a contract. Once MCA began distribution in 1971, &quot;Jerry Clower from Yazoo City, Mississippi Talkin&quot;&#x27; retailed more than a million dollars over 10 months and stayed in the top 20 on the country charts for 30 weeks.

Clower&#x27;s first on-stage engagement occurred in the early 1970s when country radio station owner and show promoter, Marshall Rowland (WQIK, Jacksonville; WDEN, Macon; WQYK, Tampa), received an early Clower recording (&quot;The Coon Huntin&#x27; Story&quot;) which was met with rave reviews by his station&#x27;s listeners in Jacksonville. Rowland contacted Clower and offered him an airplane ticket and a few hundred dollars to come open for an upcoming tour Rowland had booked with Charley Pride. Clower arrived back-stage for the Saturday night show at the Jacksonville Coliseum, but Pride&#x27;s manager Jack Johnson refused to allow it because Clower was non-union. Rowland averted the situation by putting Clower on stage while the lights were up and people were still entering the Coliseum. Clower performed for about 30 minutes. Pride, who watched from backstage, is said to have then taken Clower under his wing and introduced him at the next of Rowland&#x27;s shows as his &quot;new friend.&quot; Clower and Rowland remained very close friends for the years that followed, connecting for events, and working shows together. Clower was a frequent face at Rowland&#x27;s radio stations over the remaining years of his life, and the music was known to be interrupted with Clower&#x27;s comedy recordings from time to time, especially at WQIK in Jacksonville, where his career can be said to have been launched in earnest.

His stories often featured the Ledbetters, a quintessential Southern, country folk. Clower made 27 full-length recordings in his 27-year career as a professional entertainer (not counting &quot;best of&quot; compilations). With one exception, all the recordings were released by MCA. The exception was &quot;Ain&#x27;t God Good&quot;, which Clower recorded with MCA&#x27;s blessing at a worship service. Word Records promoted and distributed this title in 1977. This recording gave Clower, always a staunch Christian, an opportunity to present his personal testimony in a comfortable church setting. Clower was well known for his faith and often makes references to God in his stories. He spoke at many Southern Baptist Convention events. He said his faith kept him happy and able to make others laugh.

In 1973, Clower became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and continued to perform there regularly until his death. He also co-hosted a radio show called &quot;Country Crossroads&quot; with Bill Mack and Leroy Van Dyke, which has aired in syndication for 40 years and a television version of the program was produced, as well, starting in 1993. Clower&#x27;s involvement began in 1973 and lasted well over 20 years. This show was produced and distributed by the Southern Baptist Convention.

Clower also taped segments of &quot;Nashville On the Road&quot;, which included comedic performances and interviews with other country artists featured on the show. Jim Ed Brown hosted the series with Clower during the program&#x27;s first season, 1975–76, and they were joined by Helen Cornelius in 1976. Their involvement in the series lasted until 1981. The show continued to air with new host Jim Stafford through 1983.
Clower&#x27;s last album was &quot;Peaches and Possums&quot;, released posthumously in October 1998. He was the author of four books. The book &quot;Ain&#x27;t God Good&quot; became the basis for an inspirational documentary film of the same title that won an award from the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival.

<text>Douglas Irvin Pederson (born January 31, 1968) is an American professional football coach and former quarterback who was the head coach for the Philadelphia Eagles and Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). He spent most of his 13-season career as a backup to Brett Favre on the Green Bay Packers, where he was a member of the team that won Super Bowl XXXI. Pederson was also a backup to Dan Marino on the Miami Dolphins and a starter for the Philadelphia Eagles and Cleveland Browns until retiring in 2004.

Pederson began his coaching career under Andy Reid, serving as an assistant for the Eagles from 2009 to 2012. After Reid became the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013, Pederson followed him to serve as the Chiefs&#x27; offensive coordinator. Pederson returned to the Eagles as their head coach in 2016, a position he held for five seasons. His most successful season with the Eagles was in 2017 when he won Super Bowl LII, the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title. Pederson became the head coach of the Jaguars in 2022, and in his first season there he led them to their first division title and first playoff victory since 2017.

==Playing career==
===Early life===
Pederson was born in Bellingham, Washington, in 1968. He was raised in nearby Ferndale, Washington, and attended Ferndale High School, and was an All-State selection in football, basketball, and baseball. His quarterback coach at Ferndale was Ray Ramsay. After high school he graduated from Northeast Louisiana University, where he was quarterback from 1987 through 1990. He still holds multiple passing records at the school.

===Professional===
====Miami Dolphins====
Pederson originally signed as a rookie free agent by the Miami Dolphins on May 1, 1991, out of Northeast Louisiana University (now University of Louisiana at Monroe) in Monroe, Louisiana. He was waived on August 17, 1991, before the start of the regular season. After spending the 1991 season as a free agent, the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (WLAF) drafted him in the fifth round for the first pool of draft-eligible players on February 4, 1992. The second pool, which was drafted from on February 20, consisted of players allocated by NFL teams to the league. He was the backup quarterback to Reggie Slack with the Knights from March to May 1992.

After the WLAF season finished, he was re-signed by the Dolphins on June 2, 1992. Pederson spent 1992 training camp with the Dolphins, before being released during final roster cuts again. He was subsequently re-signed to the team&#x27;s practice squad, where he practiced on the scout team until he was waived on October 8, 1992. He was re-signed by the Dolphins after the season on March 3, 1993. After his third training camp with the Dolphins, he was waived again on August 31, 1993. For the second consecutive season, Pederson was re-signed to the team&#x27;s practice squad, on September 1, 1993. Dan Marino, the Dolphins&#x27; starting quarterback since 1983, ruptured his Achilles&#x27; tendon in a week 6 game against the Cleveland Browns on October 10, 1993, forcing backup Scott Mitchell to replace him. Pederson replaced Marino on the active roster, and served as Mitchell&#x27;s backup for the next four games. Pederson made his NFL debut on October 24, 1993, in a week 8 game against the Indianapolis Colts. He helped head coach Don Shula win his NFL-record 325th victory as a coach when Mitchell suffered a separated shoulder in a week 11 game against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 14, 1993. In that record-breaking game for Coach Shula, Pederson entered in the third quarter of the game and went 3 for 6 for 34 yards while converting several crucial third downs. Pederson was able to steer the Dolphins to the win. Pederson also served as the backup to recently acquired Steve DeBerg for the three games Mitchell missed with injury. He briefly entered a week 14 game against the New York Giants while DeBerg was receiving stitches on his face. Mitchell returned as the Dolphins&#x27; starter after week 15, and Pederson was released in favor of backup DeBerg and third-string quarterback Hugh Millen on December 16, 1993.
Pederson re-signed with the Dolphins on April 16, 1994, after the season ended. He spent the entire 1994 season on the Dolphins&#x27; active roster as the third-string quarterback behind Marino and Bernie Kosar. On February 15, 1995, Pederson was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the twenty-second round of the NFL Expansion Draft, after being placed on the Dolphins&#x27; available players list on January 19, but was released on May 24, 1995. He returned to the World League after his release, playing with Rhein Fire. Pederson re-signed with the Dolphins again in June 1995. After competing with Dan McGwire throughout training camp, Pederson was waived on August 22, 1995. Marino suffered a knee injury during a week 6 game, so Pederson was re-signed on October 10 to serve as the third quarterback behind Kosar and McGwire for the next two games. He was released again after Marino returned for week 9 on October 24.

====Green Bay Packers (first stint)====
Pederson worked out for the Green Bay Packers following week 10 in 1995, due to a season-ending injury suffered by backup Ty Detmer and a minor injury sustained by starter Brett Favre. Third-string quarterback T. J. Rubley was forced to play in week 10 and threw a game-ending interception after calling an audible, going against head coach Mike Holmgren&#x27;s playcall. The Packers signed Bob Gagliano to serve as the third-stringer quarterback for weeks 11 and 12. Pederson replaced Gagliano as the third-string quarterback when he signed with the Packers on November 22, 1995. The Packers claimed Jim McMahon off waivers from the Browns to serve as Favre&#x27;s backup ahead of Pederson and Rubley on November 29, 1995. Rubley was waived on December 13, leaving McMahon and Pederson as Favre&#x27;s backups. Favre did not miss any games, so Pederson did not see any game action for the Packers in 1995. Pederson served as the third quarterback behind Favre and McMahon in 1996, playing in one game but recorded no statistics. He received a Super Bowl ring following the Packers&#x27; win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. He re-signed with the Packers with a two-year contract on February 20, 1997. Pederson was again the third quarterback throughout 1997, backing up Favre and Steve Bono. Pederson beat out Rick Mirer for the backup job to Favre, as well as the primary placekick holder job, in 1998. In a week 5 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Pederson replaced Favre in the last five minutes of a blowout game, and threw two touchdowns in his place. However, Pederson suffered a broken jaw that knocked him out for the team&#x27;s next four games.

====Philadelphia Eagles====
Pederson signed a three-year, $4.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on February 18, 1999, to become the team&#x27;s starting quarterback under new head coach Andy Reid, who was Pederson&#x27;s quarterbacks coach in Green Bay from 1997 to 1998. The Eagles drafted Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft in April 1999, and Reid said Pederson would remain the starter until McNabb was ready to play. In his nine starts for the Eagles, Pederson had a 2–7 record, a 51.6% completion rate, 1,168 passing yards, six touchdowns, and nine interceptions. In his first career start, a week 1 game against the Arizona Cardinals, Pederson threw two touchdowns in the first quarter to help give the Eagles a 21–0 lead. The Cardinals came back, however, and won the game on a field goal as time expired, 25–24. Pederson went 12-for-25 for 91 yards and two touchdowns in the game. McNabb replaced Pederson, who suffered a bruised throwing shoulder, after one half in a week 2 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which Pederson went 12-of-19 for 100 yards and an interception. Pederson started a week 3 shutout loss (26–0) to the Buffalo Bills, going 14-of-26 for 137 yards and two lost fumbles, before being replaced by McNabb again in the fourth quarter. In a week 4 loss to the New York Giants, Pederson went 6-for-15 for 75 yards and two interceptions before being replaced by McNabb after halftime. Pederson&#x27;s first NFL win came in week 5 in a game against the Dallas Cowboys. He played the entire game, going 11-of-29 for 145 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Pederson played the entirety of the next three games, posting a 1–2 record while throwing three touchdowns and three interceptions. In his final start as an Eagle, Pederson was benched at halftime of a week 9 game against the Carolina Panthers after going 3-of-9 for 28 yards and being down 23–0. He did not see game action at quarterback again until a week 14 game against the Cowboys in which McNabb suffered an injury in the fourth quarter. Pederson went 8-for-12 for 108 yards and a touchdown in the loss, and Koy Detmer received the start ahead of him in week 15 with McNabb still injured. After Pederson spent the next season&#x27;s training camp with the team, the Eagles released him on August 28, 2000.

====Cleveland Browns====
Pederson considered retirement after being released by the Eagles, but instead signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Browns on September 2, 2000. The Browns&#x27; backup, Ty Detmer, suffered a season-ending injury, and the Browns needed a backup quarterback to starter Tim Couch. This was the second time in Pederson&#x27;s career that he was signed to replace an injured Ty Detmer. Pederson started as the third quarterback behind Couch and Spergon Wynn, until Couch suffered a season-ending injury in week 7. Pederson started the next six games, posting a 1–5 record. In a week 13 game against the Baltimore Ravens, he was knocked out of the game with bruised ribs and replaced with Wynn. Wynn started the next week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but he suffered a season-ending injury and Pederson replaced him. Pederson returned for the final two games of the season, losing both, including a 35–24 loss to his former team, the Eagles, and a 24–0 shutout loss to the Tennessee Titans. Pederson was released after the season on February 22, 2001.

====Green Bay Packers (second stint)====

The Packers re-signed Pederson to a one-year contract on March 13, 2001, to replace backup Matt Hasselbeck, who was traded to the Seattle Seahawks. Pederson was the primary backup to Favre for the entire 2001 season, and was the primary placekick holder in every game. He was re-signed to a one-year, $650,000 contract with the Packers on April 2, 2002. Pederson again was the backup quarterback and primary holder in all 16 games in 2002. In a week 7 game against the Washington Redskins, Favre suffered a sprained knee and Pederson took most of the snaps in the second half, going 9-for-15 for 78 yards to help win the game 30–9. Pederson also played in games against the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, and New York Jets. He re-signed with the Packers to a one-year, $750,000 contract on April 29, 2003. For the third consecutive season, Pederson backed up Favre in all 16 games and held placekicks. He completed both of his passes during the regular season for a total of 16 yards. The Packers re-signed Pederson to a one-year contract on April 28, 2004. Tim Couch was signed to compete for the backup quarterback job, but lost out to Pederson and was released on September 5, 2004. In a week 3 game against the Indianapolis Colts, Pederson replaced Favre in a blowout loss and went 4-of-6 for 34 yards and an interception. The next week, a week 4 game against the New York Giants, Favre sustained a concussion in the third quarter, and Pederson replaced him at quarterback. Pederson went 7-of-17 for 86 yards and an interception in the loss before he suffered a hit to his side in the third quarter that resulted in a cracked bone in his back, a torn muscle in his side, and a broken rib. He stayed in the game up until the last snap, when he was replaced by third-string quarterback Craig Nall. Pederson was placed on injured reserve on October 7, ending his season. He retired in March 2005 to become a head coach at Calvary Baptist Academy.

==NFL career statistics==

===Postseason===
==Coaching career==
===Calvary Baptist Academy===
After his retirement, Pederson was hired as head coach of Calvary Baptist Academy, a private Christian high school in Shreveport, Louisiana. Calvary was going into its second year as a program when Pederson signed on in March 2005.

Pederson was the head coach at Calvary for four years, and held a 33–7 record in the regular season and an 8–3 record in the post-season. The Cavaliers were in the state playoffs all four years with Pederson as head coach. In his first season in 2005, the Cavaliers went 5–6 and lost in the first round of the state playoffs. In 2007, he led the Cavaliers to the semi-finals and to their first district title.

===Philadelphia Eagles (assistant)===

On January 29, 2009, Pederson was hired as the offensive quality control coach for the Philadelphia Eagles, reuniting him with his former head coach, Andy Reid. He was promoted to quarterbacks coach on February 8, 2011, replacing James Urban, who was promoted to assistant offensive coordinator.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
On January 11, 2013, Pederson followed Andy Reid to the Kansas City Chiefs to serve as offensive coordinator. Following a 1–5 start in 2015, Andy Reid gave Pederson play-calling duties. The Chiefs proceeded to win their last 10 games, which made Pederson a head coaching candidate for 2016.

===Philadelphia Eagles (head coach)===
====2016====
On January 18, 2016, Pederson was hired as head coach of the Eagles replacing Chip Kelly. Despite having Sam Bradford on the roster as the starting quarterback, the Eagles drafted Carson Wentz with the second overall pick in 2016. Right before the 2016 season began, Bradford was traded to the Minnesota Vikings and Wentz was named the starting quarterback as a rookie. Pederson and Wentz won their first three NFL games together, but finished the season 7–9, missing the playoffs.

====2017====
Pederson&#x27;s second season was much more successful as he led the Eagles to a 13–3 record, winning them the NFC East division championship and allotting them home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Wentz, who was having a career year and was considered a front runner for league MVP, tore his ACL in Week 14, leaving backup Nick Foles with the starting job for the remainder of the year. Despite the Eagles becoming major playoff underdogs due to the loss of Wentz, Foles filled in admirably as the starter, allowing Philadelphia to make it to Super Bowl LII, their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2004 season. Foles, the eventual Super Bowl MVP, led the team to a 41–33 win over the New England Patriots, giving them their first Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first league championship since 1960.

====2018====
On May 3, 2018, it was reported that the Philadelphia Eagles picked up Pederson&#x27;s fifth-year option, allowing him to coach the team through 2020. Later on that summer, it was reported that Pederson signed a contract extension through the 2022 NFL season.

Pederson&#x27;s third season was not as successful as his previous one. The Eagles struggled with many injuries to their secondary and wide receivers. After starting 4–6 in their first 10 games the Eagles proceeded to win 5 of their last 6 games including upset victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans. After winning their last game against the Washington Redskins and the Minnesota Vikings losing to the Chicago Bears, the Eagles made it back to the playoffs with a 9–7 record as the sixth seed. The Eagles went on to upset third-seeded Chicago in a defensive showdown, 16–15. During the final ten seconds of the game, Pederson called a timeout before Bears placekicker Cody Parkey could score the game-winning field goal, negating his successful attempt. Parkey missed on his subsequent kick in a play that became known as the Double Doink, securing Philadelphia&#x27;s victory. However, after a promising start to their Divisional Round game in New Orleans, the Eagles fell to the New Orleans Saints, 20–14. This was Pederson&#x27;s first career postseason loss as a head coach.

====2019====
The following season, the Eagles had multiple injuries for the second straight year. After starting 5–7 in the first 12 games, the Eagles managed to win their last 4 games and finished with a 9–7 record for the second consecutive year and their second NFC East division title in three years. They subsequently lost to the Seattle Seahawks 17–9 in the Wild Card Round.

====2020====
On August 2, 2020, Pederson tested positive for COVID-19 during training camp. He planned to communicate with the team virtually during his quarantine, and he relinquished day-to-day head coaching duties to assistant head coach Duce Staley in the interim. Pederson returned to the team on August 12. In the 2020 season, the Eagles had their third straight year of injuries, mainly on the offensive line. The Eagles reached a record 14 different offensive line combinations during the season. Pederson faced controversy during the Eagles&#x27; final game against the Washington Football Team when he pulled quarterback Jalen Hurts out for backup Nate Sudfeld in the third quarter while facing a three-point deficit. Philadelphia subsequently lost 20–14 to finish with a division-worst 4–11–1 record. Although Pederson said the decision was to give Sudfeld the opportunity to play, he was accused of deliberately losing the game to increase the Eagles&#x27; draft position.

While it was initially reported on January 2, 2021, that Pederson would return to the Eagles for the next season, it was reported on January 11 that Pederson and the Eagles organization were parting ways. Pederson finished his tenure in Philadelphia with a regular season record, playoff record and a career record.

After reports that Pederson had discussions with the Seahawks about their open offensive coordinator position, it was reported that Pederson would choose to take a year off from coaching in the 2021 season. During the 2021 season, Pederson made visits to practices with the Colts and Bears and he was a contributor to The 33rd Team.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===

====2022====
On February 4, 2022, Pederson was hired as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars. His first win with the Jaguars was the Week 2 defeat of the Indianapolis Colts by 24–0. In Week 4, Pederson returned to Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia for a game against his former team, the Philadelphia Eagles, who were the only remaining undefeated team that season. Despite the Jaguars getting an early 14–0 lead, the Eagles came back and won the game 29–21. After the game, Pederson did a jersey/jacket swap with Eagles center Jason Kelce. Despite starting the season 3–7, the Jaguars came out of their bye week and won six of their last seven games, finishing 9–8 and winning the division for the first time since 2017. The Jaguars became the third team since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, along with the 2004 San Diego Chargers and the 2008 Miami Dolphins, to draft first overall and then win their division in the following season.

In the Wild Card Round against the Los Angeles Chargers, the Jaguars committed five turnovers in the first half and found themselves down 27–0 in the second quarter, but they managed to rally and win 31–30 off a field goal by Riley Patterson in the final seconds. The 27-point comeback was the third largest in NFL playoff history, and the largest in franchise history. The Jaguars also became the first team in NFL playoff history to win a playoff game with an in-game turnover margin of −5. The Jaguars saw their season end in the next round with a 27–20 loss in the Divisional Round to the Kansas City Chiefs, the eventual Super Bowl winners.

====2023====
Before Jacksonville&#x27;s December 4 appearance on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, their record was 8–3. The Jaguars eventually had a late-season collapse and lost four straight games. Following a loss to the Tennessee Titans in Week 18, the Jaguars fell to a final record of 9–8 and missed the playoffs and the chance to win the AFC South, finishing second behind the Houston Texans.

====2024====
The Jaguars lost their first four games in 2024 and never got back on track. An embarrassing 52–6 loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 11 fueled reporters&#x27; speculation that &quot;the end could be nigh&quot; for Pederson&#x27;s job. He continued to coach the Jaguars but was fired the morning after the team&#x27;s final game of the 4–13 season that, as reported, &quot;fell seismically short of owner Shad Khan&#x27;s expectations.&quot;

==Personal life==
Pederson was born in Bellingham, Washington. A devout Christian, Pederson and his wife Jeannie have three sons, including Josh, also a professional football player. During his time with the Eagles, Pederson lived in Moorestown, New Jersey.

<text>Adam Curtis (born 26 May 1955) is an English documentary filmmaker. Curtis began his career as a conventional documentary producer for the BBC throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. The release of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1992) marked the introduction of Curtis&#x27;s distinctive presentation that uses collage to explore aspects of sociology, psychology, philosophy and political history.

His style has been described as involving, &quot;whiplash digressions, menacing atmospherics and arpeggiated scores, and the near-psychedelic compilation of archival footage&quot;, narrated by Curtis himself with &quot;patrician economy and assertion&quot;. His films have won five BAFTAs.

==Early life==
Adam Curtis was born in Dartford in Kent, and raised in nearby Platt. His father was Martin Curtis (1917–2002), a cinematographer with a socialist background. Curtis won a county scholarship and attended the Sevenoaks School. It was there that an influential art teacher introduced him to the work of Robert Rauschenberg. Curtis completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in human sciences at Mansfield College, Oxford. He began a PhD and taught in politics, but ultimately became disillusioned with academia and decided to leave the profession.

==Career==
===Early career===
Curtis applied to the BBC and was hired to make a film for one of its training courses, comparing designer clothes in music videos to the design of weapons. He was subsequently given a post on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, a magazine series that juxtaposed hard-hitting investigations and light-hearted content. He was a film director on &quot;Out of Court&quot;, a BBC Two legal series, from 1980 until 1982.

===Politics===
Curtis is inspired by the sociologist Max Weber, who, he argues, challenged the &quot;crude, left-wing, vulgar Marxism that says that everything happens because of economic forces within society&quot;. Curtis has answered questions on his politics in interviews over his career but has answered inconsistently, making it hard to label his politics. In a 2012 interview, Curtis remarked on his political outlook stating fondness for libertarian ideas but states his politics are unique and differ depending on the issue. Curtis also rejects being labelled a leftist, calling the idea &quot;rubbish&quot;, saying:

In a 2021 interview, Curtis stated having sympathies to radicalism and that progressivism is his politics. He notes again his political inconsistency, saying:

In a 2022 interview, Curtis reiterated the neoconservative interpretation of &quot;The Century of the Self&quot; but added it is not what he himself believes. This time, Curtis states that he does not know his exact politics, saying:

===Documentaries===

Curtis cites the &quot;U.S.A. trilogy&quot;, a series of three novels by John Dos Passos that he first read when he was thirteen, as the greatest influence on his work: 

Other creative influences are Robert Rauschenberg and Émile Zola. Curtis makes extensive use of archive footage in his documentaries. He has acknowledged the influence of recordings made by Erik Durschmied and is &quot;constantly using his stuff in my films&quot;. Discussing his process in an interview with fellow documentary-maker Jon Ronson for &quot;Vice&quot;, Curtis said his extensive work with footage acquired from the BBC Archives is often led by &quot;instinct and imagination&quot;, with the aim of creating &quot;a mood that gives power and force to the story I&#x27;m telling&quot;.

Instead of specially composed music, which Curtis has said &quot;creates a sort of monoculture&quot;, he uses tracks from a variety of genres, decades, and countries, as well as sound effects that he discovers on old tapes. According to a profile of Curtis by Tim Adams, published in &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;If there has been a theme in Curtis&#x27;s work ... it has been to look at how different elites have tried to impose an ideology on their times, and the tragicomic consequences of those attempts&quot;.

In 2005, Curtis received the Golden Gate Persistence of Vision Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival. In 2006, he was given the Alan Clarke Award for Outstanding Creative Contribution to Television at the British Academy Television Awards. In 2009, the Sheffield International Documentary Festival gave Curtis the Inspiration Award for inspiring viewers and other documentary filmmakers. In 2015, he was awarded the True Vision Award by the True/False Film Fest. Curtis&#x27;s critics have accused him of exaggeration and distortion, even wilful misrepresentation.

===Blog===
Curtis administered a blog subtitled &#x27;The Medium and the Message&#x27; hosted by the BBC and updated between 2009 and 2016.

<doc id="1142259" wikidata="Q1970439" url="?curid=1142259" title="Balance shaft">
<text>Balance shafts are used in piston engines to reduce vibration by cancelling out unbalanced dynamic forces. The counter balance shafts have eccentric weights and rotate in the opposite direction to each other, which generates a net vertical force.

The balance shaft was invented and patented by British engineer Frederick W. Lanchester in 1907. It is most commonly used in inline-four and V6 engines used in automobiles and motorcycles.

==Overview==

The operating principle of a balance shaft system is that two shafts carrying identical eccentric weights rotate in opposite directions at twice the engine speed. The phasing of the shafts is such that the centrifugal forces produced by the weights cancel the vertical second-order forces (at twice the engine RPM) produced by the engine. The horizontal forces produced by the balance shafts are equal and opposite, and so cancel each other.

The balance shafts do not reduce the vibrations experienced by the crankshaft.

==Applications==
=== Two-cylinder engines ===
Numerous motorcycle engines— particularly parallel-twin engines— have employed balance shaft systems, for example the Yamaha TRX850 and Yamaha TDM850 engines have a 270° crankshaft with a balance shaft. An alternative approach, as used by the BMW GS parallel-twin, is to use a &#x27;dummy&#x27; connecting rod which moves a hinged counterweight.

=== Four-cylinder engines ===
Balance shafts are often used in inline-four engines, to reduce the second-order vibration (a vertical force oscillating at twice the engine RPM) that is inherent in the design of a typical inline-four engine. This vibration is generated because the movement of the connecting rods in an even-firing inline-four engine is not symmetrical throughout the crankshaft rotation; thus during a given period of crankshaft rotation, the descending and ascending pistons are not always completely opposed in their acceleration, giving rise to a net vertical force twice in each revolution (which increases quadratically with RPM).

The amount of vibration also increases with engine displacement, resulting in balance shafts often being used in inline-four engines with displacements of or more. Both an increased stroke or bore cause an increased secondary vibration; a larger stroke increases the difference in acceleration and a larger bore increases the mass of the pistons.

The Lanchester design of balance shaft systems was refined with the Mitsubishi Astron 80, an inline-four car engine introduced in 1975. This engine was the first to locate one balance shaft higher than the other, to counteract the second order rolling couple (i.e. about the crankshaft axis) due to the torque exerted by the inertia caused by increases and decreases in engine speed.

In a flat-four engine, the forces are cancelled out by the pistons moving in opposite directions. Therefore balance shafts are not needed in flat-four engines.

=== Five-cylinder engines ===
Balance shafts are also used in straight-five engines such as GM Vortec 3700.

=== Six-cylinder engines ===
In a straight-six engine and flat-six engine, the rocking forces are naturally balanced out, therefore balance shafts are not required.

V6 engines are inherently unbalanced, regardless of the V-angle. Any inline engine with an odd number of cylinders has a primary imbalance, which causes an end-to-end rocking motion. As each cylinder bank in a V6 has three cylinders, each cylinder bank experiences this motion. Balance shaft(s) are used on various V6 engines to reduce this rocking motion.

=== Eight-cylinder engines ===
Examples are the Mercedes-Benz OM629 and Volvo B8444S engine.

<doc id="1142274" wikidata="Q289352" url="?curid=1142274" title="Elafius">
<text>Elafius, alternately Elaphus and Elasius, was recorded as a British figure of the fifth century AD. Elafius is the name used by Bede, while the best texts of Constantius of Lyon record the name as Elaphus and Elafus.

He is the only named British figure (apart from the martyr-saint Alban) in the &quot;Vita Germani&quot; (Life of Saint Germanus), written by Constantius of Lyon in the mid to late 5th century, which describes two visits to Britain by bishop Germanus of Auxerre. According to Constantius during Germanus&#x27;s second visit to Britain (perhaps in c. AD 446–447) he met Elafius and miraculously cured his crippled son. This act served to demonstrate to the Britons that Catholicism was the true faith rather than Pelagianism.

Elafius is mentioned as being &quot;regionis illius primus&quot;&#x27; or &#x27;leader of that region&#x27; in chapters 26 and 27 of Constantius of Lyon&#x27;s hagiography of Germanus and also in Chapter XXI of Bede&#x27;s Ecclesiastical History of England. Both sources mention that &quot;provincia tota&quot; or &#x27;the whole province&#x27; followed him to witness the cure. This description can be taken to mean that Elafius was one of a number of local warlords rather than leader of all post-Roman Britain and might provide a small insight into the political situation in the area at the time. By means of comparison, a Briton Germanus is recorded as having met seventeen years earlier, in 429, is described by Constantius as being of tribunician rank. This remnant Roman term and the Romanised society it represents may therefore have been abandoned by Elafius&#x27; time as he is accorded no such title. On the other hand there may be little significance in the term if it is just being used as a general term for a civil official, while the fact that Elafius was a local leader need not &quot;necessarily&quot; imply he had the character of a &#x27;warlord&#x27; or that there was not someone who was regarded as the dominant leader of the entire ex-province at the time (something, however, we can hardly know, one way or the other).

One might speculate that Elafius&#x27; court, or place of residence, may have been at St Albans, the former Roman city of &quot;Verulamium&quot;, since that was very probably the cult centre for Saint Alban, visited by Germanus on his first visit to Britain - or alternatively some other ex-Roman city of Southern Britain. If Elafius was a leader he may have played a role in the subsequent exile of the Pelagian preachers although this banishment is described as being decided through common consent rather than a warlord&#x27;s orders or even a Roman legal process.

Elafius is a name of Greek origin (&quot;elaphos&quot;=&#x27;deer&#x27;) which in this period was best recorded from the South of Gaul.

==Doubtful Historicity==
The &quot;Vita Germani&quot; is not a historical source that Chadwick cannot necessarily verify in every detail. 
The historicity remained unquestioned for 1,400 years until Chadwick&#x27;s struggles with Catholicism casting doubt on its historicity.

Nora K. Chadwick quoted Constantius himself: “So many years have passed it is difficult to recover the facts from the silence in which they are buried”. Edward Arthur Thompson emphasised how poorly informed Constantius seems to have been about Germanus’s British visit compared to his activities in Gaul and Italy. (Especially if a critical doubting author is fully unable to recognize humility and true intention of the heart because of their bursting pride) Meanwhile, Professor Ian S. Wood has interpreted Constantius&#x27; account of Germanus&#x27;s two British expeditions as in large part &#x27;allegorical&#x27; rather than factual. This applies especially to the story told about Elafius where the curing of his son symbolises the spiritual cure that Germanus is bringing to Britain by cleansing it of the Pelagian heresy. It forms a direct parallel with the curing of the blind girl, described as having taken place on Germanus&#x27;s first visit.

Even more pertinently Germanus&#x27;s second visit to Britain, as described by Constantius, has been suspected as representing merely a ‘doublet’, of the first: a version that was so badly remembered that it appeared to Constantius or his source as representing an entirely different, &#x27;second&#x27;, visit. As Norah Chadwick noted, in both visits, the object is the same, Germanus is accompanied by another bishop and the incident of the cured boy of the second visit is matched by an incident in which Germanus cures a blind girl in the first. Then there is the fact that on both visits, as Germanus sets out, there are ‘demons’, active against him (in the first they provoke bad weather: in the second we are told they are unable to do this, but instead spread news of his approach). Professor Ian Wood argued for the authenticity of the second visit: he quoted the &quot;Vita Genovefa&quot; (Life of St Genevieve) but this (perhaps 6th c. work) is one of many sources written after Constantius&#x27;s &quot;Vita Germani&quot; which are likely to have been influenced by it. The allocation to Germanus of a different, named, companion - Severus instead of Lupus - remains hard to explain but it might be that it was details like this (originating perhaps with the oral transmission of one version of the tale) that persuaded Constantius that Germanus must have made two separate visits.

A recent study by Professor Anthony Barrett has concluded that the complex problems surrounding the dating of the life of Saint Germanus can be most credibly solved on the basis that he made only one visit. Particularly important to his argument are the near-contemporary mentions made by Prosper of Aquitaine. He mentions Germanus&#x27;s first visit (under the year 429) but not any second one (in later versions of his chronicle up to 455). In another work (his &quot;In Collatorem&quot;) he describes the exile of the Pelagians which Constantius attributes to the second visit. Ian Wood noted that the harsher treatment of the Pelagians on the second visit was something that differentiated it from the first but it could be that it represents a desire to corroborate the success of the first visit while allowing a valid purpose for the second. In any case, the point is that Prosper&#x27;s mention in his &quot;In Collatorem&quot; was almost certainly written before any second visit could take place. He refers to a lapse of over 20 years since the start of the Pelagian controversy dated to 413 in his chronicle - which would date his &quot;In Collatorem&quot; to circa 433. Even more decisively he involves Pope Celestine I in this event and since Pope Celestine died in 432 it must have occurred before that time – which Professor Barrett argues would not allow time for a second visit. - especially since, according to Constantius, that second visit happened after Germanus visited Arles to secure tax relief, something that probably occurred in the mid-430s.

If the second visit of Germanus to Britain is, indeed, a &#x27;doublet&#x27; of the first it would cast something of a shadow over the reliability of, at least the British episodes of Constantius&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; – and certainly everything that occurs in the second visit. This would have to represent a version of the story of Germanus&#x27;s visit that had changed so much in the telling that it had become unrecognisable as the same as a better-recorded version and consequently was assumed by Constantius or his source, to represent another, &#x27;second&#x27;, visit. It would particularly throw into doubt the figure of &quot;Elafius&quot;, who is something of a mysterious anomaly, in any case, given that he represents the only named Briton in the whole of Germanus&#x27;s account (besides the martyr-saint Alban). Conceivably he might then represent, like the expulsion of the Pelagians, a detail originally connected with the (first and only) visit of 429. On the other hand, he may represent some outcome of the process of distortion that produced a second &#x27;unrecognisable&#x27; version of the story of the first and only visit. As noted above he is connected with an episode (the curing of his son by Germanus) that looks more like allegory than historical fact and which duplicates a similarly allegorical episode (the curing of the blind girl by Germanus) in the &quot;first&quot; visit.

Katt was born in Los Angeles to actors Bill Williams (birth name Herman August Wilhelm Katt) and Barbara Hale. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley and began acting as a teenager, sometimes appearing with his parents. He graduated from Army and Navy Academy, Carlsbad, California.

==Career==

Katt attended Orange Coast College before pursuing a career as a musician. Inspired by his father, he then started an acting career, appearing in summer stock theatre and in small television roles. His earliest film credits include the role of a jock, Tommy Ross in Brian De Palma&#x27;s 1976 horror film adaptation &quot;Carrie&quot;, which allowed Katt to make a name for himself. In 1978, he appeared as Barlow, a young surfer, in the John Milius drama film &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; opposite Jan-Michael Vincent and Gary Busey. His mother in that film was his real-life mother, Barbara Hale. The following year he took the role of Sundance Kid in the 1979 film &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot;. The role in &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; made him so well known in the surfing community that in 2004 he presented one of the Association of Surfing Professionals awards at their annual World Championship Tour ceremony to wild applause from the crowd of professional surfers. Katt explained in a 1979 interview with critic Roger Ebert that he was holding out only for parts that were personally interesting to him.

In December 1975, Katt auditioned for the part of Luke Skywalker in 1977&#x27;s science fiction blockbuster &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and footage of his audition has been featured in many &quot;Star Wars&quot; documentaries. He was seriously considered for the role, which went to Mark Hamill, and Katt instead starred that year in &quot;First Love&quot;, playing a college student who experiences his first romantic relationship.

In 1981, Katt was cast as the title role in a filmed version of the Broadway musical comedy &quot;Pippin&quot;, which received mixed reviews. He won his best remembered role that year, however, as Ralph Hinkley, a mild-mannered schoolteacher given a superpowered suit by aliens on the popular television series &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, a role he played until the show was canceled in 1983. Also starring veteran actor Robert Culp, the show retains a cult fanbase. Its theme song, &quot;Believe It or Not&quot;, penned by Mike Post, also became a hit in the music charts. In 1982, due to the success of the first season of &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, Katt signed to MCA and released a soft rock album, &quot;Secret Smiles&quot; under the name Billy Katt.

After &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, Katt starred in &quot;&quot; (1985), about explorers searching for apatosaurs in Africa, and the cult horror/comedy film &quot;House&quot; (1985); he later reprised his role for the third sequel, &quot;House IV&quot;, in 1992. Between 1985 and 1988, Katt starred in nine Perry Mason television films, playing the role of private detective Paul Drake Jr., son of Paul Drake, a fictional private detective in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television series and the Perry Mason series of detective stories written by Erle Stanley Gardner; Katt co-starred with his mother Barbara Hale, who reprised her role of Della Street from the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television series. Katt starred in the 1989 TV series &quot;Top of the Hill&quot; and made a guest appearance on the first episode of the short-lived 1991 series &quot;Good Sports&quot;.

Katt continues to appear on television and in supporting film roles, and does voice acting as well. He appeared in an episode of &quot;House&quot; in 2006. In recent years, he has returned to genre work, with appearances in &quot;Andromeda&quot; and &quot;Justice League&quot; and roles in the award-winning film &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;The Man from Earth&quot; (2007), and &quot;&quot; (2007).

Katt briefly appeared in &quot;Heroes&quot; season 3 in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; as a nosy reporter investigating Ali Larter&#x27;s character. He portrayed Jack Matheson in the thriller film &quot;Mirrors 2&quot;. In 2010 during season 6, Katt guest starred as C.J. Payne&#x27;s musician birth-father in the episode &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Daddy Now?&quot; in the Tyler Perry comedy &quot;House of Payne&quot;.

Katt also has written a &quot;Greatest American Hero&quot; comic book and contributed to that series&#x27; Facebook page.

In 2013, Katt played himself in the spoof film &quot;Paranormal Movie&quot; directed by Kevin Farley. In 2014, he appeared in &quot;The Unwanted&quot;. In 2020, he appeared in &quot;The 2nd&quot;.

==Personal life==
Katt married Deborah Kahane in 1979 and they have two sons, Clayton and Emerson. They divorced in 1992.

He married Danielle Hirsch in 1993 and has a daughter with her, Dakota, as well as a stepson, Andrew.

<doc id="1142298" wikidata="Q1258797" url="?curid=1142298" title="Victor Horsley">
<text>Sir Victor Alexander Haden Horsley (14 April 1857 – 16 July 1916) was a British scientist and professor. 

He was born in Kensington, London. Educated at Cranbrook School, Kent, he studied medicine at University College London and in Berlin, Germany (1881) and, in the same year, started his career as a house surgeon and registrar at the University College Hospital. From 1884 to 1890, Horsley was Professor-Superintendent of the Brown Institute. 

In 1886, he was appointed as Assistant Professor of Surgery at the National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy, and as a Professor of Pathology (1887–1896) and Professor of Clinical Surgery (1899–1902) at University College London. He was a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage and was an opponent of tobacco and alcohol.

==Personal life==

Victor Alexander Haden Horsley was born in Kensington, London, the son of Rosamund (Haden) and John Callcott Horsley, R.A. and the brother of Rosamund Brunel Horsley. His given name, Victor Alexander, was given to him by Queen Victoria.

In 1883, he became engaged to Eldred Bramwell, daughter of Sir Frederick Bramwell. On 4 October 1887, Victor and Eldred married at St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. They had two sons, Siward and Oswald, and a daughter, Pamela.

He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year.

Horsley was a champion of many causes. One of his primary life crusades was the temperance movement. Having observed that many injuries admitted to the hospital were due to alcohol, Horsley threw himself into becoming a temperance reformer. He soon rose up to the position of vice president of the National Temperance League and the president of the British Medical Temperance Association. In 1907, along with Dr. Mary Sturge, he published a book on alcoholism titled &quot;Alcohol and the Human Body&quot;.

According to his biographers, Tan &amp; Black (2002), &quot;Horsley&#x27;s kindness, humility, and generous spirit endeared him to patients, colleagues, and students. Born to privilege, he was nonetheless dedicated to improving the lot of the common man and directed his efforts toward the suffrage of women, medical reform, and free health care for the working class (...) An iconoclast of keen intellect, unlimited energy, and consummate skill, his life and work justifies his epitaph as a &quot;pioneer of neurological surgery&quot;.

==Medical career==

Horsley specialised in surgery and in physiology. He was the first physician to remove a spinal tumor, in 1887, by means of a laminectomy. He developed many practical neurosurgical techniques, including the hemostatic bone wax, the skin flap, the ligation of the carotid artery to treat cerebral aneurysms, the transcranial approach to the pituitary gland and the intradural division of the trigeminal nerve root for the surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

As a neuroscientist, he carried out studies of the functions of the brain in animals and humans, particularly on the cerebral cortex. His studies on motor response to faradic electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex, internal capsule and spinal cord became classics of the field. Those studies later translated into his pioneering work on neurosurgery for epilepsy. Between 1884 and 1886, Horsley was the first to use intraoperative electrical stimulation of the cortex for the localization of epileptic foci in humans, preceding Fedor Krause and Wilder Penfield.

He was also a pioneer in the study of the functions of the thyroid gland. He studied myxedema and cretinism, which are caused by a decreased level of the thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), and established for the first time, in experiments with monkeys, that they could be treated with extracts of the gland.

Appointed in 1886 as secretary to a governmental commission formed to study the anti-rabies vaccine developed by Louis Pasteur, Horsley corroborated his results and created a campaign to vaccinate against rabies in the United Kingdom. As a pathologist, he carried out research on bacteria and founded the &quot;Journal of Pathology&quot;.

In June 1886, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and, in 1891, jointly with his brother-in-law Francis Gotch, delivered their Croonian Lecture on the subject of the mammalian nervous system. In 1893, he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. A year later, in 1894, he won the Royal Medal for &quot;his investigations relating to the physiology of the nervous system, and of the thyroid gland, and to their applications to the treatment of disease&quot;.

Horsley, who had been a keen rifle shot when serving in the Artists&#x27; Rifles as a medical student, also investigated the effect of gunshot wounds on the brain, experimenting with animals provided by a butcher and using the recently issued Lee-Metford rifle. He concluded that the immediate cause of death that follows was due to respiratory failure, not heart failure.

His best-known innovation is the Horsley–Clarke apparatus, developed in 1908 together with Robert H. Clarke, for performing the so-called stereotactic surgery, whereby a set of precise numerical coordinates are used to locate each brain structure. He was a pioneer in neurosurgery and operated on a total of 44 patients.

He authored the book &quot;Functions of the Marginal Convolutions&quot; (1884) and, as a co-author, &quot;Experiments upon the Functions of the Cerebral Cortex&quot; (1888) and &quot;Alcohol and the Human Body&quot; (1902).

==Political career==
Horsley was a Liberal Party supporter and contested the December 1910 General election as a Liberal candidate for the London University seat. The Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society campaigned against his election because of his involvement with vivisection. Following the election, he was adopted as prospective Liberal candidate, first for Islington East and then, in 1913, for Harborough in Leicestershire. Harborough was a Liberal seat and a general election, expected to take place in 1914 would most likely have seen him elected to parliament. However, he resigned as prospective candidate, citing opposition to his views on women&#x27;s suffrage and temperance on the part of constituency officials, just before the First World War started.

Horsley strongly supported the Liberals&#x27; welfare state initiative, the National Insurance Act of 1911, despite strong opposition from most of his medical colleagues.

==First World War service and death==
In 1910, Horsley was commissioned as a captain in the Territorial Army, in the 3rd London General Hospital of the Royal Army Medical Corps. On the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for active duty on the Western Front, where he was initially posted as surgeon at the British hospital at Wimereux, France. In May 1915, he was posted as a colonel and Director of Surgery of the British Army Medical Service in Egypt, based at the 21st General Hospital in Alexandria, in support of the Dardanelles Campaign. In the following year, he volunteered for field surgery duty in Mesopotamia, where he died unexpectedly in Amarah, Iraq, on 16 July 1916, of heatstroke and severe hyperpyrexia, at only 59 years of age.

==Namesakes==

Horsley was the first neurosurgeon appointed to the hospital in Queen Square, London, now called the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery – the Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery is named in his honour. 

The Walton Centre for Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery NHS Trust in Liverpool, England, another leading Neurosurgical Hospital, dedicated its intensive care unit to him, naming it the Horsley ward. 

At its Annual Representatives Meeting, the British Medical Association has a series of lunchtime lectures entitled The Victor Horsley Lectures. After the Second Gulf War, a British Field Hospital was established at Shaibah Logistics Base, and the area of tented accommodation for hospital staff was known as Horsley Lines. 

Horsley is credited with the invention of the &quot;Horsley Hook&quot;, a device which he used to avulse the trigeminal nerve.

<text>Raichur District is an administrative district in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is located in the northeast part of the state and is bounded by Yadgir district in the north, Bijapur and Bagalkot district in the northwest, Koppal district in the west, Bellary district in the south, Jogulamba Gadwal district of Telangana and Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh in the east.

==Geography==
The district is bounded by the Krishna River on the north and the Tungabhadra River on the south. The wedge of land between the rivers is known as the Raichuru Doab, after the city of Raichur. Bijapur and Yadgir districts lie to the north across the Krishna River. Bagalkot and Koppal districts lie to the west. Across the Tungabhadra lies Bellary District of Karnataka to the southwest and Mahabubnagar of Telangana to the southeast. Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh state lies to the east, and includes the lower portion of the Raichur Doab.

==History==

The recorded history of the district is traced to as far back as the third century B.C. The fact that three minor rock edicts of Ashoka are found in this district one at Maski in the Lingasugur taluk and the other two near Koppal, prove that this area was included in the dominions of the great Mauryan king Ashoka (273 - 236 B.C.). At that time, this region was under the governance of the Viceroy or Mahamatra of Ashoka. Early in the Christian era, the district appears to have been a part of the kingdom of the Satavahanas. The Vakatakas, who reigned during the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D., seem to have held sway over Raichur for sometime, after which it appears to have been included in the Kadamba dominions. The next dynasty of importance, which ruled over this region, was that of the Chalukyas of Badami. According to an inscription from Aihole, Pulakeshin II having defeated the Pallavas, occupied this area and made it a province in his empire under the governance of his son Adityavarma. Later the whole of the present Raichur district was included in the dominions of the Rashtrakutas, who rose to power in the eighth century, as could be gathered from the inscriptions of that period found in this district. According to an inscription from Manvi taluk, one Jagattunga, a subordinate ruler under the Rashtrakuta king Krishna-II, was ruling the province of Adedore Eradusavirapranta, i.e., the area constituting the present Raichur district. Nripatunga, a Rashtrakuta king, has described Koppal in his Kannada work, Kavirajamarga, as the great Kopananagara.

Numerous inscriptions of the Western Chalukyas, found in the various parts of the district, testify to the fact that this region was under their sway for a considerable length of time between the 10th and 12th centuries A.D. It is learnt from an inscription found at Naoli in Lingsugur taluk that during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya-V, the Adedore-pranta, i.e., the Raichur region, was being ruled by his younger brother Jagadekamalla-I. Another inscription from Maski describes the place as a capital and makes a reference to the reign of Jayasimha. There were, however, frequent wars between the Chola kings of the south and the Chalukyan kings of Kalyani (aka Western Chalukyas) for supremacy over the Raichur region and the territory had passed into the hands of the Cholas for a brief period. The Haihayas and Sindas also seem to have ruled some parts of this region for sometime. Later, after the fall of the Chalukyas, Raichur passed into the hands of the Kalachuris of Kalyani and later Sevna Yadava kings. Then came the Kakatiyas in the 13th century. From an inscription on the fort-wall of Raichur, referred to earlier, it is learn that the original fort was built by one Gona Ganna Reddy, a general of the Kakatiya queen Rudramma Devi of Warangal, in 1294 A.D., at the instance of the latter. Raichur was sacked by Malik Kafur, was commander of Sultanate of Delhi in 1312.

Raichur district was passed to Vijayanagara Empire in 1323 after the demise of the Kakatiyas due to invasions of the Sultanate of Delhi. It was captured by the Bahmani Sultanate in 1363. It was passed to the Bijapur Sultanate in 1489 after the fragmentation of the Bahmanids. Vijayanagara recaptured it after the Battle of Raichur in 1520, but Bijapur recaptured it in 1565 after Vijayanagara&#x27;s defeat at hands of Deccan Sultanates during the Battle of Talikota. Aurangzeb, emperor of Mughal Empire, captured the district in 1686. Finally, Raichur became part of the Nizam of Hyderabad between 1724 and 1948 except when it was under British Empire rule between 1853 and 1860 as part of Madras Presidency. During Nizam rule it was part of Gulbarga Division.

After Operation Polo, Hyderabad State was integrated into the Indian Union on 17 September 1948. Between 1948 and 1956, it was part of Hyderabad State. During the division of the state on a linguistic basis, it became part of Mysore State and later was renamed at Karnataka.

<text>Predictor@home was a volunteer computing project that used BOINC software to predict protein structure from protein sequence in the context of the 6th biannual CASP, or Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. A major goal of the project was the testing and evaluating of new algorithms to predict both known and unknown protein structures.

Predictor@home was complementary to Folding@home. Whereas the latter aims to study the dynamics of protein folding, Predictor@home aimed to specify what the final tertiary structure will be. Also, the two projects differ significantly in the infrastructure they use. The project used BOINC software, whereas Folding@home maintains its own software completely outside of BOINC.

However, for a time, Predictor@home competed with other BOINC protein structure prediction projects, such as Rosetta@home. Each uses different methods of rapidly and reliably predicting the final tertiary structure.

Predictor@home is currently inactive.

==History==
Predictor@home holds the distinction of being the first independent BOINC project to be launched. The project was set up and run by Michela Taufer at The Scripps Research Institute.

On September 6, 2006, Predictor@home was temporarily taken off line, with no new work units being sent out. In May, 2008, the project reverted to Alpha status while experimenting with new methods.

Over the summer of 2008, the project servers were moved to the University of Michigan and as of December 2008, the project had not sent out any work for some months. BOINC stats sites were unable to obtain updated XML data, as this had been suspended by the project team.

On June 10, 2009, the Predictor@home web site and forums were shut down.

<text>The Project 940 Lenok class (a type of salmon) (known in the West by its NATO reporting name India class) was a military submarine design of the Soviet Union. Two vessels of this class were built for the Soviet Navy; both were scrapped in the 2000s.

The submarines of this class were designed to function as mother ships for two India-class deep-submergence rescue vehicles (DSRVs), and had decompression chambers and medical facilities on board. While India-class boats were seen going to the aid of Russian submarines involved in incidents, they had also been observed working in support of Russian Spetsnaz operations.

<doc id="1142310" wikidata="Q6619040" url="?curid=1142310" title="List of common nouns derived from ethnic group names">
<text>This is a list of common nouns, used in the English language, whose etymology goes back to the name of some, often historical or archaic, ethnic or religious group, but whose current meaning has lost that connotation and does not imply any actual ethnicity or religion.

Several of these terms are derogatory or insulting. Such entries on this list should not be confused with &quot;ethnic slurs&quot; referring to a person&#x27;s actual ethnicity, which have a separate list.

==List==
; Apache: A Parisian gangster or thug (from the collective name Apache for several nations of Native Americans).

;Bohemian: A person with an unconventional artistic lifestyle (originally meaning an inhabitant of Bohemia; the secondary meaning may derive from an erroneous idea that the Romani people originate from Bohemia). Not used as an insult in most circumstances.
;Bugger: Synonymous with sodomite. From Middle English &quot;bougre, heretic,&quot; from Anglo-French &quot;bugre,&quot; from Medieval Latin &quot;Bulgarus,&quot; literally, &quot;Bulgarian;&quot; (from the association of Bulgaria with the Bogomils, who were accused of heresy and sodomy). is a phrase meaning to ruin or spoil something in British English, and it is also used in some English-derived creoles like Tok Pisin ()
;Cannibal: A human who consumes human flesh (originally meaning Carib, thought to be cannibals).

;Cohee : (U.S.) Originally (mid-18th century) a Scots-Irish settler into the Virginia Piedmont; later (late 18th century) a backwoodsman, hick, or most severely &quot;poor white trash&quot;, especially on the frontier or in the Appalachian area. Post Civil War: a self-referential indicating an independent backwoods small farmer in the West Virginia/Carolina/Tennessee/Kentucky area.

;Goth: A crude person, lacking culture or refinement; an obsolete term, originally from the East Germanic tribe of Goths that sacked Rome in 410. The term Gothic for high medieval architecture was originally a pejorative term used during the Renaissance for styles considered archaic and barbaric. A separate sense refers to members of the current Goth subculture. 

;Gringo: A foreigner; especially used disparagingly against North Americans and Europeans in Latin America. (Possibly from the Spanish word &quot;griego&quot;, meaning Greek. In Roman days, foreigners were usually divided into Greeks and Barbarians. The use of the term Greek for something foreign or unintelligible can also be seen in the expression &quot;it&#x27;s Greek to me&quot;.) Another theory is that during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the American army wore green uniforms, so Mexicans would yell at them “green go home” and later shortened it to “green go” (phonetically similar).

;: A swindler; a racehorse owner; in Britain also a male servant at a college—from Gypsy, which in turn is derived from Egyptian.

;Hun: Barbarous or destructive person; also in used in World War I (and to a lesser extend World War II) as an ethnic slur for the Germans. From the confederation of Eurasian tribes that first appeared in Europe in the 4th century, leading to mass migrations of Germanic tribes westward, and which established an empire extending into Europe in the 5th century, known for plundering wealthy Roman cities. In modern Scotland and Northern Ireland the term is a derogatory reference to a Protestant, or a supporter of a historically Protestant football club, most notably Rangers F.C.
;Mongol (or Mongoloid): An obsolete term for people with Down syndrome, which was originally medically classified as &quot;Mongoloid Idiocy&quot;. The shorthand version &quot;mong&quot; is also used as an insult.

;Philistine: A person indifferent or hostile to artistic and cultural values. From a people that inhabited Canaan when the Israelites arrived, according to the biblical account.

;Podunk: An insignificant town. Derived from the exonym of an Algonquin people living in what is now Connecticut.

;Pygmy (or Pigmy): A person of short stature (possibly in reference to certain hunter-gatherer peoples, such as the Mbuti of Central Africa, sometimes grouped together under the term Pygmies, but that designation actually stems from the original meaning of pygmy as an unusually small person).

;Samaritan: A generous or helpful person. From the Biblical story of the Good Samaritan. Samaritans are an ethnoreligious group centered in the Levant and their religion is related closely to Judaism.

;Sherpa:An expert guide through difficult circumstances. From the Sherpa people, a Nepalese ethnic group, who serve as guides and porters in the Himalayas. Used for the personal representative of a head of state or government who prepares an international summit, particularly the annual G8 Summit.

;Tartar: A violently ferocious person, a rather obsolete term, from the nomadic Tatars who participated in the 13th century Mongol invasion of Europe, later generalized to any Mongolian or Turkic invaders of Europe.

;Vandal: A person who willfully and maliciously destroys property, from the East Germanic tribe that sacked Rome in 455.

<text>The Nyamiha or Nemiga (, ; , ) is a river in Minsk. Today it is contained within a fabricated culvert. It discharges into the Svislach.

The first mention of the river in historical chronicles is connected with the disastrous Battle on the Nemiga River, which took place on the riverbank in 1067 when the forces of the prince of Kievan Rus&#x27; defeated the forces of Polatsk princedom. The medieval epic The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign refers to the &quot;bloody river banks of Nyamiha,&quot; with lines that detail the battle:

For a long time, it was the second largest river flowing through Minsk, until it was adapted for its urban location by containment within a network of pipes. One part of the river was put into a pipe in 1926, and the rest in 1955. Today, the river is a minor feature of the city environment, and the name Nyamiha more commonly refers to the street above.

Notably, in the Lithuanian language, &quot;Nemiga&quot; is interpreted to mean &quot;the river that does not sleep.&quot;

Niamiha Street is part of a shopping district famous for its amber craftwork. The Nyamiha metro station on the street was the site of a human stampede on May 30, 1999.

Another incident on Nyamiha Street occurred on July 25, 2004, when a two-hour downpour in Minsk caused the storm sewers to overflow. Nyamiha Street and its environs were flooded.

<text>The Lisbon Metro () is a rapid transit system in Lisbon, Portugal. Opened in December 1959, it was the first rapid transit system in Portugal. 
, the system&#x27;s four lines total of route and serve 56 stations.

== History ==

=== Initial plans ===

The idea of building a system of underground railways for the city of Lisbon first arose in 1888. It was first proposed by Henrique de Lima e Cunha, a military engineer who had published a proposal in the journal &quot;Obras Públicas e Minas&quot; &quot;(Public Works and Mines)&quot; for a network with several lines that could serve the Portuguese capital. Concrete plans took longer to evolve, though. Lanoel Aussenac d&#x27;Abel and Abel Coelho presented theirs in 1923, and José Manteca Roger and Juan Luque Argenti theirs one year later, in 1924. None of these plans were carried out.

After World War II, in which Portugal remained neutral, the national economy took off and the financial possibilities arising from the Marshall Plan provided a strong boost to the potential construction of a metro in Lisbon. A society was formed on 26 January 1948 with the purpose of studying the technical and economic feasibility of the project.

=== 1955–1979: Beginning of operations ===

Construction began on 7 August 1955, and four years later, on 29 December 1959, the Lisbon Metro was inaugurated. The network was formed by a Y-shaped line linking Restauradores to Rotunda (now Marquês de Pombal), branching then to Entre Campos and to Sete Rios (now Jardim Zoológico), where the rolling stock depot (PMO I) which was also linked to the outer-loop Cintura Line of CP was located. Two services were operated on the system: one between Restauradores and Sete Rios (which later became part of the Blue Line), and one between Restauradores and Entre Campos (which later became part of the Yellow Line).

The new system was well received by the public, and in the first year the Metro carried more than 15.3 million passengers. The metro has proved an important factor in urban development of the city, outlining new areas of housing and services. On 27 January 1963, the first phase of the central portion of the network (later the Green Line) opened with an extension from Restauradores to Rossio; the second phase (from Rossio to Anjos) opened on 28 September 1966 and the third phase (from Anjos to Alvalade) opened on 18 June 1972.

After this first extension, no further extensions began construction until the early 1980s. In 1974, after the Carnation Revolution, the management model was changed, being nationalized in 1975 and renamed &quot;Metropolitano de Lisboa, EP&quot; in 1978. Under the new management, works were carried to enlarge platforms, originally designed to receive two cars, so that these could receive four cars.

=== 1980–1989: Initial expansion ===
In the 1980s, additional extensions to the metro network began to be studied. An extension from Alvalade to Calvanas was planned to begin construction in 1980 and the extension from Sete Rios to Colégio Militar (later Colégio Militar/Luz) was expected to begin construction in 1982.

In 1984, works began to extend the eastern branch of the initial line from Entre Campos to Campo Grande (then called Cruz Norte). At the same time, construction of the extension from Alvalade to Campo Grande began; plans to build a station at Calvanas, near the Júlio de Matos hospital, had already been abandoned at the time.

By the end of the decade, on 14 October 1988, the extension connecting Sete Rios to Colégio Militar/Luz was inaugurated, opening three stations: Laranjeiras, with artwork by Sá Nogueira, Alto dos Moinhos (artwork by Júlio Pomar), and Colégio Militar/Luz (artwork by Manuel Cargaleiro). Cidade Universitária (connected to the main campus of the University of Lisbon, with artwork by Maria Helena Vieira da Silva) opened at the same time, as part of the extension from Entre Campos to Campo Grande. These four stations were the first to be built from scratch with platforms long enough to receive six cars () and with artwork in the platforms themselves.

=== 1990–1999: Rapid expansion to accommodate Expo &#x27;98 ===


In 1990, the Network Expansion Plan was presented, which included extensions from Rossio to Cais do Sodré and from Restauradores to Baixa-Chiado, splitting the Y in Rotunda (extending the branch from Picoas to a new station, Rato) and the extension Colégio Militar/Luz–Pontinha (including a new depot near the Pontinha station, PMO III).

In 1991, the first prototype of the ML90 car series was presented, consisting of two triple units (motor-trailer-motor) of six cars (with the first unit being numbered M-201, R-202 and M-203), built by Sorefame/Bombardier. These cars had a digital destination sign, were generally more comfortable and could operate with or without the trailer. The motor cars in these two triple units were also the only ones to have a front door to the cab, which was not included in further batches.

On 3 April 1993, the elevated Campo Grande station opened, along with the expansions Alvalade–Campo Grande and Cidade Universitária–Campo Grande. With this extensions, the network grew . In the same month, the ML90 prototype cars were used for the first time.

In 1993, the second Network Expansion Plan was presented, intended to serve Expo &#x27;98. It recommended that the Metro should operate the following routes by 1999:

* would run from the northwest end of the city at Pontinha to the east end of Baixa (Terreiro do Paço);
* would run from the Lumiar to Campolide;
* would run from Telheiras to the seaport at Cais do Sodré;
* would run from Alameda to the exposition site at Moscavide in the northeastern end of the city.

The PMO II depot at Campo Grande was finished in the autumn of 1994 after eleven years of works. At the end of this year, the second batch of ML90 was ordered, consisting of 17 triple units (or 51 cars). On 15 July 1995, the two services were finally realigned into Line A (blue) between Colégio Militar/Luz and Campo Grande via Rossio, and Line B (yellow) between Campo Grande and Rotunda. The old Rotunda station (now Rotunda I) was extended from 75 to 105 metres and totally refurbished, while the new station (Rotunda II) already had a platform with 105 metres.

By the end of 1996, the second batch of ML 90 (numbered M-207 to M-257) was ready; colors and materials used in this second batch differed somewhat from that made up the first. The rolling stock was now composed of 191 coaches: 80 of them ML7, 54 ML90 and 57 ML79. On 18 October 1997, the Blue Line expansion from Colégio Militar/Luz to Pontinha opened, expanding the network by . In December of the same year, Rato opened, from Rotunda II. Orders for new rolling stock continued in 1997, when half of the cars now known as ML95 were delivered (19 electric triple units, motor-trail-motor, or 57 cars). These new coaches, which look similar to ML90, have some technical differences, like a different engine and electrical door control (unlike the pneumatic control used on its predecessors). The new logo of the Lisbon Metro was first inserted into these new coaches.

1998 was a year when most of the said expansion projects were completed; as early as March the names of four stations had changed:

* Sete Rios → Jardim Zoológico
* Palhavã → Praça de Espanha
* Rotunda I and II → Marquês de Pombal I and II
* Socorro → Martim Moniz

In March 1998, the section between Rossio and Campo Grande became part of the Green Line, which removed the connection between Restauradores and Rossio stations from regular service. On 18 April, the section Rossio - Cais do Sodré () was opened, with two stations: Baixa-Chiado and Cais do Sodré, the latter connecting to the train and boat stations.

The Red Line (Line D at the time) would be inaugurated on 19 May 1998, three days before the opening of Expo &#x27;98. This line was long and included five new stations: Alameda II, Olaias, Bela Vista, Chelas, and Oriente; the line began running six car trains beginning in June of that year on an experimental basis in order to satisfy the demand of passengers visiting Lisbon during Expo &#x27;98. By this time, the entire ML95 series had been delivered, numbered M-301 to M-414.

Later in 1998, Cabo Ruivo (on 18 July) and Olivais (on 8 August) opened as infill stations on the Red Line, between Chelas and Oriente. The rolling stock was then composed of 305 cars – 80 ML7, 54 ML79, 57 ML90 and 114 ML95, and the network comprised 40 stations.

In 1999, the PMO III depot opened near the Pontinha station, replacing the old PMO I depot at Sete Rios, in an event where the prototype of the future car series (now known as ML97) was presented, which would consist of 18 articulated triple units (54 cars). The main difference from the previous series was the possibility of free movement between each car. In addition, the prototype had a more modern image, and also introduced digital automatic passenger information. According to the operator, the trailer of these triple units can be removed, although this has never been witnessed. The first cars were issued during 1999, numbered M-501 to M-554. The rolling stock, at the turn of the millennium, was made of 361 cars of five train types (80 ML7, 54 ML79, 57 ML90, 114 ML95, 54 ML97), the largest number of train cars to date before the retirement of the ML7 and ML79 series in 2000 and 2002, respectively.

=== 2001–2016: Continued expansion ===


On 2 November 2002, under Manuel Frasquilho&#x27;s tenure as president, the Green Line&#x27;s extension from Campo Grande to Telheiras opened. In 2004, the network opened its first extensions outside the geographical limits of the city: first, in March, with the expansion of the Yellow Line from Campo Grande to Odivelas (which included five new stations, two of which are aboveground); then, in May, the Blue Line was extended from Pontinha to Amadora Este. Later that year, construction of the Red Line segment between Alameda and São Sebastião began.

On 19 December 2007, after 11 years of construction, the final -long section of the Blue Line between Baixa-Chiado and Santa Apolónia opened, with some controversy and many successive delays due to the difficulty of construction. The segment was originally slated to open in 2001, but in 2000, cracks were discovered in the original tunnel that led to land subsidence. The consequent flooding of the tunnel seriously slowed down the completion of work and road traffic at the Praça do Comércio and part of the Avenida Infante D. Henrique was forced to be closed temporarily while the new tunnel was constructed in its place. The stations themselves (Terreiro do Paço and Santa Apolónia) were completed in the summer of 2007.

On 29 August 2009, the Red Line section between Alameda II and São Sebastião II was inaugurated, such that all lines now cross each other.

On 17 July 2012, the Red Line was extended between Oriente and Aeroporto, adding to the network. Three new stations have been inaugurated: Moscavide, Encarnação and Aeroporto, which is directly linked to the Lisbon Portela Airport. A journey from the central Saldanha station to the Lisbon Airport now only lasts about 16 minutes. The Red Line also serves the Moscavide neighbourhood, and was expected to carry 400,000 extra passengers each year.

The Blue Line segment between Amadora Este and Reboleira on the Blue Line opened on 17 April 2016, twelve years after the initial portion of the segment between Pontinha and Amadora Este was completed.

===2017–present===
Further modernization works to the Lisbon Metro began on 19 July 2017, when the Arroios station on the Green Line was closed for extensive renovations and the expansion of the platforms to allow six-car trains; the station was originally scheduled to reopen in 2019, but reopening was later postponed to no earlier than 2021 due to construction delays. The renovated station finally reopened in September 2021. On 8 June 2018, portions of the platform edges at the Encarnação station on the Red Line partially collapsed onto the tracks, which necessitated a week-long closure of the segment between the Moscavide and Aeroporto stations. For the last two years of the 2010s, the metro&#x27;s ridership growth began to slow as a result of economic concerns; after years of steady growth, ridership increased from 169 million passengers in 2018 to 173 million passengers in 2019 before it began to decline in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 29 September 2020, portions of the tunnel near the Praça de Espanha station on the Blue Line collapsed while the station was undergoing renovation works, necessitating a temporary closure of the line between Laranjeiras and Marquês de Pombal stations.

====Proposed extensions====

On 8 May 2017, the government of Portugal announced an extension of the Yellow Line to Cais do Sodré as part of a new operational master plan. The extension, which will connect the Yellow Line with the Green Line and is expected to open in 2024, will contain two new stations at Estrela and Santos; Campo Grande will also be reconstructed as part of the project. Construction on this extension began on 16 April 2021. Once the extension is placed into service, the Green and Yellow lines will be reorganised: the Green Line will run as a circular route and will take over the section of the Yellow Line between Campo Grande and Rato. With this change, the Yellow Line is proposed to extend from Telheiras to Benfica. This extension has been opposed by several groups, including the government of Odivelas and the PSD; the latter proposed a bill to the government in July 2019 that would call for the suspension of the project in favour of a metro extension into Loures.

An extension to the Red Line is also projected to be built, extending it to four entirely new stations: Campolide/Amoreiras, Campo de Ourique, Infante Santo and Alcântara. The project, if it goes forward, is projected to be completed by around 2026.

A new line, the Violet Line, is also projected to be constructed in the coming years. Unlike the rest of the Metro, this line would not be heavy rail, nor mostly underground, but rather surface light rail. It will connect the area of Infantado, in Loures to the metro station of Odivelas and then to Beatriz Ângelo Hospital, with the line making a &quot;C&quot; shape. It is planned to be completed by around 2025.

* 2010: Several stations on the Green Line are being lengthened to accommodate 6 car trains, enabling standardisation of rolling stock.
* 17 July 2012: New stations on the Red Line: Moscavide, Encarnação and Aeroporto. The line now connects Saldanha station to Lisbon Airport in just 16 minutes.
* 7 April 2016: Blue Line extended from Amadora Este to Reboleira railway station. This involved extending the tunnel from Amadora Este, which passes under the former spur track linking the Sintra Line of CP to the old Sorefame factory towards the Reboleira metro station located under the said train station. The opening was originally planned for 2011–2012. However, the opening of the extension was delayed for four years due to financial difficulties.
*19 July 2017: Arroios station closed for renovations.
*14 September 2021: Arroios station reopened.

== Lines ==

The Lisbon Metro comprises four lines running on of route and serving 56 stations. The lines were formerly known by picturesque names; logos based on the former names are still used. These picturesque names are still used as secondary names.

== Operation ==

===Operating hours and frequency===
Metro service starts every day at 06:30 and stops at 01:00 (the last trains arrive at the terminal stations by 01:30). However, some station exits close before 01:00. Trains run at a 5–8 minutes headway.

===Ticketing and fares===

There are two methods of payment: 
*The contactless Cartão 7 Colinas/Viva Viagem card
*The contactless Lisboa Viva card which can also double up as monthly passes
*The contactless Lisboa Navegante card which can either be charged with the metropolitan pass, or only for the Lisbon municipality

All three cards can also be used on other modes of transport like Fertagus, CP (including its suburban rail service) and the Transtejo &amp; Soflusa ferry service.

== Rolling stock ==

===Current===
Currently, four types of trains are in service on the Lisbon Metro. Unlike most metro systems, the trains do not have any form of air conditioning due to the small size of the tunnels. 
* ML90 series (since 29 March 1993)
* ML95 series (since 1997)
* ML97 series (since 1 February 1999)
* ML99 series (since 3 July 2000, 1 carriage destroyed in a PMO incident in 2002)

===Former===
* ML7 series (from 29 December 1959 until 31 January 2000, two cars preserved and run on certain special occasions)
* ML79 series (from 1 January 1984 until 11 July 2002, two cars preserved for exhibition)

===Future===
* ML20 series (from January 2025)
* ML24 series (from 2027)

In 2021, Stadler Rail and Siemens Mobility won a contract to supply 14 three-car trains for Lisbon Metro. They are designated as the ML20 series. The first train was delivered from the Stadler Rail Valencia SAU factory in Spain on 9 August 2024 and is planned to enter service in January 2025. 

In October 2024, Lisbon Metro again signed a contract with Stadler, this time for the supply of 24 three-car trains with an option for 12 more, designated as the ML24 series.

== Art ==
The architecture and decor of an underground station is a key element for the well-being of passengers, and art works to make travel more appealing. Lisbon Metro is one of the various underground systems in the world where art is best represented, much like the Munich U-Bahn in Germany, Moscow Metro in Russia, Montreal Metro in Canada and the Stockholm metro in Sweden. From the beginning, there was a concern to make a smooth visual transition between surface and underground. Architect Francisco Keil do Amaral (1910–1975) designed a station model, which was used as a template for all stations built until 1972. In this model, the decor was very moderate, with smooth but firm lines, much like the Portuguese political regime at the time. The original eleven stations, except Avenida, had artwork by his wife, painter Maria Keil (1914–2012).

In 1988, with the completion of new expansions, there was still a concern about organizing and decorating stations, thus these stations featured works by contemporary Portuguese artists: Rolando de Sá Nogueira in Laranjeiras, Júlio Pomar in Alto dos Moinhos, Manuel Cargaleiro in Colégio Militar/Luz, and Vieira da Silva in Cidade Universitária.

Since then, art has become the norm in the Lisbon Metro; lighting plays with the brightness of the azulejo tiles that are present in almost every station. In recent years, the oldest stations have been refurbished, not only to enhance the decor and aesthetics, but also to improve accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility. Parque station is generally considered to be the most valuable and interesting of them all, where the tiles map details of the Portuguese voyages of discovery and their philosophical and literary links.

<doc id="1142319" wikidata="Q5601823" url="?curid=1142319" title="Greek National Road 6">
<text>Greek National Road 6 (, abbreviated as EO6) is a national road in north-central Greece. It begins at the port of Igoumenitsa and ends at Volos, passing through the towns Ioannina, Metsovo, Trikala and Larissa. The section between Metsovo and Volos is part of the European route E92. The road runs through five regional units (Thesprotia, Ioannina, Trikala, Larissa and Magnesia) and the regions of Epirus and Thessaly.

== Route ==

The EO6 is officially defined as a east-west route through central and northwestern Greece, between Volos in the east and Igoumenitsa to the west: the EO6 passes through Larissa, Trikala, Kalabaka, , Katara Pass, Metsovo and Ioannina. The EO6 west of Trikala is particularly mountainous, passing through the Pindus, and at , the EO6 briefly overlaps with the EO18.

The EO6, between Larissa and the interchange with the A3 motorway near Trikala, is being upgraded to dual carriageway with expressway characteristics. Meanwhile, the A1 motorway provides a faster route than the overlapping EO1/EO6 section between Velestino and Larissa, and the A2 motorway (Egnatia Odos) does the same between Malakasi and Igoumenitsa.

==Places==
*Igoumenitsa (junction with A2)
*Parapotamos (junction with EO18)
*Ioannina (junctions with EO5, EO20)
*Metsovo (junction with A2)
*Panagia (junction with A2)
*Kalampaka (junction with EO15)
*Trikala (junction with EO30)
*Larissa (junctions with A1, EO1, EO3)
*Velestino (junction with A1)
*Volos (junctions with EO30, EO34)


==History==

Ministerial Decision G25871 of 9 July 1963 created the current EO6 from all or part of three short-lived national roads (listed from east to west), which existed by royal decree from 1955 to 1963: the old EO14 from Volos to Larissa; the old EO23 from Larissa to Ioannina; and the old EO26 from Ioannina to Igoumenitsa. Until 1975, the EO6 formed part of the old European route E87 from Volos to Ioannina.

<text>Fuego de los Muertos (often abbreviated to FDLM) was an annual, Burning Man affiliated, regional decompression party event. It is organized by burners from San Diego and Orange County and is hosted in the rural and semi-arid eastern part of San Diego County.

The event takes usually takes place just before or after Halloween weekend and draws inspiration from four traditions: Burning Man, Samhain, Día de los Muertos and All Hallows&#x27; Eve.

== History ==
While 2004 was first year that there was an event of this name, it was the second decompression event that has taken place in San Diego. The prior event, known as &quot;SD Decom,&quot; took place in 2003 and had an estimated attendance of 250. The 2003 event happened to coincide with the October wildfires of that year at a location that was nearly destroyed by fire.

In spite of the chilly and damp weather, FDLM managed to draw nearly 500 participants for 2004, perhaps double the attendance of the 2003 event. Two performance stages were set up for DJs, bands and belly dancers. The Mystic Art Grove had a score of art installations. Numerous theme camps were established, including the Purple Turtle Chill Zone, Liquid O, BubbleLounge, Fahrenheit 451, Vibestation, BRC Zendo, Satreheedn, Cantina de los Muertos and Haunted Chill Zone, Camp RVIP, Xara, the Massage Confessional, the Space Bars, Phat Elvis, and more. A wide variety of events took place including a fire eating workshop, Zen meditation, massages, and even a wedding.

In 2007 the event was hosted at The Village, a property just outside Borrego Springs, CA. The event sold out and attracted the largest number of participants to date. Artistic expression was limited due to permit restrictions and poor weather. Once again, the event was notably affected by wildfire; it took place just as the nearby California wildfires of October 2007 began. Highway closures affected some as they returned to San Diego.

<text>climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net (CPDN) is a volunteer computing project to investigate and reduce uncertainties in climate modelling. It aims to do this by running hundreds of thousands of different models (a large climate ensemble) using the donated idle time of ordinary personal computers, thereby leading to a better understanding of how models are affected by small changes in the many parameters known to influence the global climate.

The project relies on the BOINC framework where voluntary participants agree to run some processes of the project at the client-side in their personal computers after receiving tasks from the server-side for treatment.

CPDN, which is run primarily by Oxford University in England, has harnessed more computing power and generated more data than any other climate modelling project. It has produced over 100 million model years of data so far. , there are more than 12,000 active participants from 223 countries with a total BOINC credit of more than 27 billion, reporting about 55 teraflops (55 trillion operations per second) of processing power.

== Aims ==

The aim of the climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net project is to investigate the uncertainties in various parameterizations that have to be made in state-of-the-art climate models. The model is run thousands of times with slight perturbations to various physics parameters (a &#x27;large ensemble&#x27;) and the project examines how the model output changes. These parameters are not known exactly, and the variations are within what is subjectively considered to be a plausible range. This will allow the project to improve understanding of how sensitive the models are to small changes and also to things like changes in carbon dioxide and sulphur cycle. In the past, estimates of climate change have had to be made using one or, at best, a very small ensemble (tens rather than thousands) of model runs. By using participants&#x27; computers, the project will be able to improve understanding of, and confidence in, climate change predictions more than would ever be possible using the supercomputers currently available to scientists.

The climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net experiment is intended to help &quot;improve methods to quantify uncertainties of climate projections and scenarios, including long-term ensemble simulations using complex models&quot;, identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 as a high priority. Hopefully, the experiment will give decision makers a better scientific basis for addressing one of the biggest potential global problems of the 21st century.

As shown in the graph above, the various models have a fairly wide distribution of results over time. For each curve, on the far right, there is a bar showing the final temperature range for the corresponding model version. The further into the future the model is extended, the wider the variances between them. Roughly half of the variation depends on the future climate forcing scenario rather than uncertainties in the model. Any reduction in those variations, whether from better scenarios or improvements in the models, are wanted. climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net is working on model uncertainties, not the scenarios.

Currently, scientists can run models and see that x% of the models warm y degrees in response to z climate forcings, but are uncertain as to whether x% is a good representation of the probability of that happening in the real world. Some models will be good and some poor at producing past climate when given past climate forcings and initial conditions (a hindcast). It does make sense to trust the models that do well at recreating the past more than those that do poorly. Therefore, models that do poorly will be down weighted.

==The experiments==

The different models that climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net has and will distribute are detailed below in chronological order. Therefore, anyone who has joined recently is likely to be running the transient coupled model.
* Classic Slab Model - The original experiment not under BOINC. See #The original model for further details. This model remains in use solely for the OU short course.
* BOINC Slab Model - The same as the classic Slab Model, but released under BOINC.
* ThermoHaline Circulation (THC) Model - An investigation of how the climate might change in the event of a decrease in the strength of the ThermoHaline Circulation. This experiment has now been closed to new participants as they have sufficient results. It was a four phase model totaling 60 model years. The first three phases were identical to the above Slab Models. The fourth phase imposed the effects of a 50% slowdown in the Thermohaline circulation by imposing SST changes in the north Atlantic derived from other runs.
* Sulfur Cycle Model - An investigation of the effect of sulfate aerosols on the climate. The experiment will model sulfur in a number of compound forms including dimethyl sulfide and sulfate aerosols. This experiment started in August 2005 and was a pre-requirement for the Hindcast. It is a 5 phase model totalling 75 model years. Timesteps are around 70% longer, making the model around 2.8 times longer than the initial slab model. While a few models are still tricking, model have not been issued since 2006.
* Coupled Spin-Up Model - Inclusion of oceanic influences into the basic model in a more dynamic and realistic way than the initial Slab Model. This was a pre-requirement for the Hindcast. This has been completed and, as planned, was not publicly released. The fastest 200 - 500 computers were invited to join because it is a 200-year model and results were needed by February 2006 for the transient coupled model launch.
* Transient coupled Model - This comprises an 80-year Hindcast and an 80-year forecast. The Hindcast is to test how well the models perform at recreating the climate of 1920 to 2000. It was launched February 2006 under BBC Climate Change Experiment branding and later also released from the CPDN site.
* Seasonal Attribution Project - This is a high resolution model for a single model year to look at extreme precipitation events. This experiment is much shorter due to its single model year, but there are 13.5 times as many cells and timesteps are only 10 minutes instead of 30 minutes. This extra resolution means it requires at least 1.5 gigabytes of RAM. It uses the HadAM3-N144 climate model.

==History==
Myles Allen first thought about the need for large climate ensembles in 1997, but was only introduced to the success of SETI@home in 1999. The first funding proposal in April 1999 was rejected as utterly unrealistic.

Following a presentation at the World Climate Conference in Hamburg in September 1999 and a commentary in &quot;Nature&quot; in October 1999, thousands signed up to this supposedly imminently available program. The dot-com bubble bursting did not help and the project realised they would have to do most of the programming themselves rather than outsourcing.

It was launched September 12, 2003, and on September 13, 2003, the project exceeded the capacity of the Earth Simulator to become the world&#x27;s largest climate modelling facility.

The 2003 launch only offered a Windows &quot;classic&quot; client. On 26 August 2004 a BOINC client was launched which supported Windows, Linux and Mac OS X clients. &quot;Classic&quot; will continue to be available for a number of years in support of the Open University course. BOINC has stopped distributing classic models in favour of sulfur cycle models. A more user friendly BOINC client and website called GridRepublic, which supports climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net and other BOINC projects, was released in beta in 2006.

A thermohaline circulation slowdown experiment was launched in May 2004 under the classic framework to coincide with the film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;. This program can still be run but is no longer downloadable. The scientific analysis has been written up in Nick Faull&#x27;s thesis. A paper about the thesis is still to be completed. There is no further planned research with this model.

A sulfur cycle model was launched in August 2005. They took longer to complete than the original models as a result of having five phases instead of three. Each timestep was also more complicated.

By November 2005, the number of completed results totalled 45,914 classic models, 3,455 thermohaline models, 85,685 BOINC models and 352 sulfur cycle models. This represented over 6 million model years processed.

In February 2006, the project moved on to more realistic climate models. The BBC Climate Change Experiment was launched, attracting around 23,000 participants on the first day. The transient climate simulation introduced realistic oceans. This allowed the experiment to investigate changes in the climate response as the climate forcings are changed, rather than an equilibrium response to a significant change like doubling the carbon dioxide level. Therefore, the experiment has now moved on to doing a hindcast of 1920 to 2000 as well as a forecast of 2000 to 2080. This model takes much longer.

The BBC gave the project publicity with over 120,000 participating computers in the first three weeks.

In March 2006, a high resolution model was released as another project, the Seasonal Attribution Project.

In April 2006, the coupled models were found to have a data input problem. The work was useful for a different purpose than advertised. New models had to be handed out.

==Results to date==
The first results of the experiment were published in &quot;Nature&quot; in January 2005, showing that with only slight changes to the parameters within plausible ranges, the models can show climate sensitivities from less than 2 °C to more than 11 °C. The higher climate sensitivities have been challenged as implausible. For example, by Gavin Schmidt (a climate modeler with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York).

===Explanation===

Climate sensitivity is defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of carbon dioxide. Current levels of carbon dioxide are around 420 ppm and growing at a rate of 1.8 ppm per year compared with preindustrial levels of 280 ppm.

Climate sensitivities of greater than 5 °C are widely accepted as being catastrophic. The possibility of such high sensitivities being plausible given observations had been reported prior to the climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net experiment but &quot;this is the first time GCMs have produced such behaviour&quot;.

Even the models with very high climate sensitivity were found to be &quot;as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models&quot;. The test of realism was done with a root mean square error test. This does not check on realism of seasonal changes and it is possible that more diagnostic measures may place stronger constraints on what is realistic. Improved realism tests are being developed.

It is important to the experiment and the goal of obtaining a probability distribution function (pdf) of climate outcomes to get a very wide range of behaviours even if only to rule out some behaviours as unrealistic. Larger sets of simulations have more reliable pdfs. Therefore, models with climate sensitivities as high as 11 °C are included despite their limited accuracy. The sulfur cycle experiment is likely to extend the range downwards.

===Piani &quot;et al.&quot; (2005)===
Published in &quot;Geophysical Review Letters&quot;, this paper concludes:When an internally consistent representation of the origins of model-data discrepancy is used to calculate the probability density function of climate sensitivity, the 5th and 95th percentiles are 2.2 K and 6.8 K respectively. These results are sensitive, particularly the upper bound, to the representation of the origins of model data discrepancy.

== Use in education ==
There is an Open University short course and teaching material available for schools to teach subjects relating to climate and climate modelling. There is also teaching material available for use in Key Stage 3/4 Science, A level Physics (Advanced Physics), Key Stage 3/4 Mathematics, Key Stage 3/4 Geography, 21st Century Science, Science for Public Understanding, Use of Mathematics, Primary.

== The original model ==
The original experiment is run with HadSM3, which is the HadAM3 atmosphere from the HadCM3 model but with only a &quot;slab&quot; ocean rather than a full dynamic ocean. This is faster (and requires less memory) than the full model, but lacks dynamical feedbacks from the ocean, which are incorporated into the full coupled-ocean-atmosphere models used to make projections of climate change out to 2100.

Each downloaded model comes with a slight variation in the various model parameters.

In the initial &quot;calibration phase&quot; of 15 model years, the model calculates the &quot;flux correction&quot;; extra ocean-atmosphere fluxes that are needed to keep the model ocean in balance (the model ocean does not include currents; these fluxes to some extent replace the heat that would be transported by the missing currents).

In the &quot;control phase&quot; of 15 years, the ocean temperatures are allowed to vary. The flux correction ought to keep the model stable, but feedbacks developed in some of the runs. There is a quality control check, based on the annual mean temperatures, and models which fail this check are discarded.

In the &quot;double CO2 phase&quot;, the CO2 content is instantaneously doubled and the model run for a further 15 years, which in some cases is not quite sufficient model time to settle down to a new (warmer) equilibrium. In this phase some models which produced physically unrealistic results were again discarded.

The quality control checks in the control and 2*CO2 phases were quite weak: they suffice to exclude obviously unphysical models but do not include (for example) a test of the simulation of the seasonal cycle; hence some of the models passed may still be unrealistic. Further quality control measures are being developed.

The temperature in the doubled CO2 phase is exponentially extrapolated to work out the equilibrium temperature. Difference in temperature between this and the control phase then gives a measure of the climate sensitivity of that particular version of the model.

==Visualisations==
Many volunteer computing projects have screensavers to visually indicate the activity of the application, but they do not usually show its results as they are being calculated. By contrast, climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net not only uses a built-in visualisation to show the climate of the world being modelled, but it is interactive which allows different aspects of climate (temperature, rainfall, etc.) to be displayed. In addition, there are other, more advanced visualisation programs that allow the user to see more of what the model is doing (usually by analysing previously generated results) and to compare different runs and models.

The real-time desktop visualisation for the model launched in 2003 was developed by Jeremy Walton at NAG, enabling users to track the progress of their simulation as the cloud cover and temperature changes over the surface of the globe. Other, more advanced visualisation programs in use include &quot;CPView&quot; and &quot;IDL Advanced Visualisation&quot;. They have similar functionality. CPView was written by Martin Sykes, a participant in the experiment. The IDL Advanced Visualisation was written by Andy Heaps of the University of Reading (UK), and modified to work with the BOINC version by Tesella Support Services plc.

Only CPView allows you to look at unusual diagnostics, rather than the usual Temperature, Pressure, Rainfall, Snow, and Clouds. Up to 5 sets of data can be displayed on a map. It also has a wider range of functions like Max, Min, further memory functions, and other features.

The Advanced Visualisation has functions for graphs of local areas and over 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days, as well as the more usual graphs of season and annual averages (which both packages do). There are also Latitude - Height plots and Time - Height plots.

The download size is much smaller for CPView and CPView works with Windows 98.

As of December 2008 there is no visualisation tool that works with the newer CPDN models. Neither CPView nor Advanced Visualisation have been updated to display data gathered from those models. So users can only visualize the data through the screensaver.

== BBC Climate Change Experiment ==
The BBC Climate Change Experiment was a BOINC project led by Oxford University with several partners including the UK Met Office, the BBC, the Open University and Reading University. It is the transient coupled model of the climateprediction.net project.

Many participants joined the project with over 120,000 people signing up in teams.

Results continued to be collected for some time with the follow-up television program being aired in January 2007. On 8 March 2009, climate&quot;prediction&quot;.net officially declared that BBC Climate Change Experiment was finished, before shutting down the project.

<text>The Standards and Privileges Committee is a former committee of the United Kingdom House of Commons that existed from 1995 to 2013. The committee was established in 1995 to replace the earlier Committee of Privileges. It consisted of 10 Members of Parliament that sat to make recommendations to the House on complaints of breach of parliamentary privilege. It was itself replaced in January 2013, when it was split into the Committee on Standards and the Committee of Privileges, in order to allow the Committee of Standards to employ lay members.

The committee was appointed by the House of Commons to oversee the work of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. It examined the arrangements for the compilation, maintenance and accessibility of the Register of Members&#x27; Interests and considered specific complaints made in relation to the registering or declaring of interests and any matter relating to the conduct of Members, including specific complaints in relation to alleged breaches in the Code of Conduct which were drawn to the committee&#x27;s attention by the commissioner.

<text>The Green Berets is a 1968 American war film directed by John Wayne and Ray Kellogg, and starring Wayne, David Janssen and Jim Hutton, based on the 1965 novel by Robin Moore. Much of the film was shot in the summer of 1967. Parts of the screenplay bear little relation to the novel, although the portion in which a woman seduces a North Vietnamese communist general and sets him up to be kidnapped by Americans is from the book.

&quot;The Green Berets&quot; is strongly anti-communist and pro-South Vietnam. It was released at the height of American involvement in the Vietnam War, the same year as the Tet Offensive against the largest cities in South Vietnam. John Wayne was so concerned by the anti-war sentiment in the United States, he wanted to make this film to present the pro-military position. He requested and obtained full military cooperation and materiel from 36th President Lyndon B. Johnson and the United States Department of Defense. John Wayne bought the film rights to Robin Moore&#x27;s book for $35,000 and 5% of undefined profits of the film.

The film was a financial success at the box office, but received almost universally negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Reporter George Beckworth attends a Special Forces briefing about the reasons for American military involvement in the Vietnam War. When Beckworth doubts the value of U.S. intervention, Green Beret Colonel Mike Kirby asks him if he has ever been to Vietnam, which influences him to report on events there.

Meanwhile, Kirby is assigned to assist the South Vietnamese forces. As he prepares to depart, he catches Sgt. Petersen appropriating supplies, but decides to utilise his skills on his team. Arriving in South Vietnam, they meet Beckworth, whom Kirby allows to accompany them to their camp. Despite signs of humanitarian work, he remains unconvinced of the need to be in Vietnam.

At the camp, they meet a young war-orphan, Ham Chuck, whose family was slaughtered. Ham Chuck, along with his dog Jamoke, takes a liking to Sgt. Petersen. Petersen takes him in as if he were his own son.

Following an enemy attack, M/Sgt. Muldoon notices a South Vietnamese soldier acting suspiciously and knocks him out, allowing South Vietnamese Captain Nghiem to interrogate him. After Beckworth sees Nghiem torture a confession from the soldier, he confronts Kirby, who justifies the act by telling Beckworth that their enemies are ruthless killers who deserve no legal protections of any sort in this new kind of war.

A few days later, while accompanying Kirby and his team on a patrol in the nearby mountains, Beckworth finds that the granddaughter of a village chief he had befriended earlier has been tortured and executed by the Viet Cong for cooperating with the Americans.

The next night, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops launch a massive attack on the camp, and Beckworth is forced to fight alongside the Green Berets; he also helps move villagers into the camp to protect them from the crossfire.

Eventually, enemy sappers breach the perimeter by blowing openings in the barbed wire fences around the camp, and the Green Berets and South Vietnamese are forced to fall back to the inner perimeter. Nghiem sets off hidden explosives which kill the spies, but soon dies afterwards after being hit by a mortar.

Due to the intense attack, Kirby orders a retreat from the camp, and U.S. helicopters arrive to evacuate the refugees. Petersen puts Ham Chuck on one and promises to return for him in Da Nang. With the base in enemy hands, Kirby requests an airstrike by an AC-47 gunship, callsign Puff the Magic Dragon, which annihilates the Viet Cong guerrillas and North Vietnamese Army regulars within Camp A-107. With the enemy having taken major casualties, Kirby and his team re-occupy the destroyed camp.

Beckworth tells Kirby he will file a story supporting U.S. involvement in the war and returns to Da Nang. Back at headquarters, Kirby meets with his superior, Colonel Morgan, and his South Vietnamese counterpart, Colonel Cai. They tell him about a top secret mission to capture North Vietnamese General Pha Son Ti, allowing them to end the war on South Vietnamese terms, as well as disrupting enemy leadership. Colonel Cai uses his sister-in-law Lin, a fashion model, as a honey trap to lure General Ti to a former French colonial mansion in a well-guarded valley in North Vietnam.

Among those Cai selects (and accompanies) are Kirby, Muldoon, and Petersen. Muldoon, T/Sgt. &quot;Doc&quot; McGee, and two of Cai&#x27;s men stay behind at a bridge over a river to set explosives to blow it up to stop pursuit by the enemy forces, while Kirby and the rest of the team head towards the plantation. After eliminating the plantation&#x27;s guards, the group subdue Ti with Lin&#x27;s help, and put him in the trunk of his car. Kirby, Cai, Petersen, Sgt. Watson, and Lin drive away, but the rest of the team is killed by the guards while attempting to escape.

At dawn, the survivors cross the bridge; it is destroyed, but McGee is seriously wounded as he and Muldoon escape, while the others airlift Ti out of the area by a Skyhook device. While Kirby and the team advance through the jungle to their extraction point, Petersen is killed by a booby-trap, and the others are forced to leave his body behind.

At Da Nang, Beckworth watches as Ham Chuck runs from helicopter to helicopter, desperately searching for Petersen. Eventually, Kirby tells him of Petersen&#x27;s death and comforts him, before the two walk along the beach into the sunset.

==Cast==
The film was notable in its casting of George Takei, who was then a regular character on the series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. As a result of Takei joining the film&#x27;s cast, he missed filming nearly a third of the episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; season 2. His lines were subsequently rewritten for the character of Pavel Chekov, played by actor Walter Koenig. Koenig, who was originally cast as a rarely speaking background character, grew into one of the major &quot;Star Trek&quot; leads due to Takei&#x27;s absence, leading to Chekov becoming a regular character in both the original series and subsequent films.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
Columbia Pictures, having bought the book&#x27;s pre-publication film rights, was not able to produce a script that the Army would approve, while producer David L. Wolper, who also tried to buy the same rights, could not obtain financing to make the movie. A screenplay was written by George Goodman who had served with the Special Forces in the 1950s as a military intelligence officer and had written a 1961 article about the Special Forces called &quot;The Unconventional Warriors&quot; in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. Columbia sent Goodman to South Vietnam for research. Robin Moore felt the Pentagon pressured Wolper into breaking an agreement with Moore. Wolper acquired the rights to film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, an account of the World War II 1st Special Service Force, in 1965 and produced that film instead.

The final film&#x27;s origins began in June 1966 with a trip by John Wayne to South Vietnam, and his subsequent decision to produce a film about the Army special forces deployed there as a tribute to them. Wayne was a steadfast supporter of American involvement in the war in Vietnam. He co-directed the film, and turned down the &quot;Major Reisman&quot; role in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; to do so.

===Screenplay===
Although &quot;The Green Berets&quot; portrays the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army as sadistic tyrants, it also depicts them as a capable and highly motivated enemy. The film shows the war as one with no front lines, meaning that the enemy can show up and attack at almost any position, anywhere. It shows the sophisticated spy ring of the VC and NVA that provided information about their adversaries. Like &quot;A Yank in Viet-Nam&quot;, it gave a positive view of South Vietnam and their anti-communist allies.

The US Army had objections to James Lee Barrett&#x27;s initial script. The first was that the Army wanted to show that South Vietnamese soldiers were involved in defending the base camp. That was rectified. The Army also objected to the portrayal of the raid where they kidnap a NVA general because in the original script this involved crossing the border into North Vietnam. Robin Moore has stated that while all of the other stories in his book are roman à clefs of actual Special Forces missions and incidents, the mission to capture General Ti was completely fictitious.

Wayne wished the screenplay to have more development of the characters, but Warner Bros. made it clear they wanted more action and less talk, as &quot;The Alamo&quot; was heavily criticized for having too much dialogue. Scenes shot with Vera Miles as the wife of Wayne&#x27;s character were jettisoned. (However, Miles was again cast as the Duke&#x27;s wife in Wayne&#x27;s next film &quot;Hellfighters&quot;).

===Filming===
Much of the film was shot in the summer of 1967 (before the Tet Offensive) at Fort Benning, Georgia. Department of Defense cooperation with the film was extensive, with the United States Army providing several UH-1 Huey attack helicopters and a C-7 Caribou light transport. The United States Air Force supplied two C-130 Hercules transports and two A-1 Skyraider attack aircraft as well as film footage of an AC-47 Puff the Magic Dragon gunship and an HC-130 Hercules employing the Skyhook Fulton recovery system for use in the film. The Army also provided authentic uniforms for use by the actors, including the OG-107 green and &quot;Tiger Stripe&quot; tropical combat uniform (jungle fatigues), with correct Vietnam War subdued insignia and name tapes.

John F. Schultz played pivotal roles as an extra as a U.S. soldier and a North Vietnamese Regular. He said of John Wayne, &quot;At lunch, the producers were going to feed us peons hamburgers and hotdogs while the main characters ate steak. John Wayne said &#x27;...we all get steak or nobody does.&#x27;

Colonel Lamar Asbury &quot;Bill&quot; Welch, the actual commander of the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning in 1967, makes a brief cameo Skeet Shooting with John Wayne. Welch wears a 1960s US Army Fatigue Baseball Cap (common issue during the Vietnam War) in the scene while the actors wear green berets. Soldiers exercising on the drill field – that Wayne shouts to – were actual Army airborne recruits in training.

The film&#x27;s large set-piece battle is loosely based on the Battle of Nam Dong on 5–6 July 1964 when two Viet Cong battalions and the PAVN attacked a CIDG camp at Nam Dong near the Laotian border in South Vietnam&#x27;s Central Highlands. For five hours, a mixed force of Americans, Australians and South Vietnamese troops fought off a force three times its size. The movie camp set, which was constructed on an isolated hill within Fort Benning, had barbed wire trenches, punji sticks, sandbagged bunkers, mortar pits, towers, support buildings and hooches. Several tons of dynamite and black powder were then used to largely destroy the set during the filming of the battle sequence. Other realistic &quot;Vietnamese village&quot; sets were left intact after the shooting ended so they could be reused by the Army for training troops destined for South East Asia.

===Music===
The original choice for scoring the film, Elmer Bernstein, a friend and frequent collaborator with John Wayne, turned the assignment down due to his political beliefs. As a second choice, the producers contacted Miklós Rózsa then in Rome. When asked to do &quot;The Green Berets&quot; for John Wayne, Rózsa replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t do Westerns&quot;. Rózsa was told &quot;It&#x27;s not a Western, it&#x27;s an &#x27;Eastern&#x27;&quot;. As a title song, the producers used a Ken Darby choral arrangement of Barry Sadler&#x27;s 1966 hit song &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot;, which had been co-written by Robin Moore, author of the original &quot;Green Berets&quot; novel. Rózsa provided a strong and varied musical score including a night club vocal by a Vietnamese singer Bạch Yến; however, bits of &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot; were deleted from the final film.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Upon its cinema release, movie critic Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and cited extensive use of cliches, depicting the war in terms of &quot;&quot;, and being a &quot;heavy-handed, remarkably old-fashioned film.&quot; It is on his &quot;Most Hated&quot; list. His then-rival at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Clifford Terry, described the film as &quot;both predictable and tedious&quot; and added that its &quot;most fatal mistake&quot; was &quot;presenting the United States&#x27; most complex war in the simplest of terms.&quot;

The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;″s critic, Stanley Eichelbaum, observed the film thus: 

Reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Renata Adler wrote, &quot;&quot;The Green Berets&quot; is a film so unspeakable, so stupid, so rotten and false in every detail that it passes through being fun, through being funny, through being camp, through everything and becomes an invitation to grieve, not for our soldiers or for Vietnam (the film could not be more false or do a greater disservice to either of them), but for what has happened to the fantasy-making apparatus in this country.&quot;

The screenplay for Oliver Stone&#x27;s anti-war film &quot;Platoon&quot; was written partially as a reaction to &quot;The Green Berets&quot;. It is mocked in the Gustav Hasford novel &quot;The Short-Timers&quot; in a scene where Joker and Rafter Man find the Lusthog Squad watching it at a movie theater. &quot;The audience of Marines roars with laughter. This is the funniest movie we have seen in a long time.&quot;

John Pilger, a strong critic of American foreign policy, described his reaction to &quot;The Green Berets&quot; in a 2007 speech he gave criticising the media for its coverage of the Vietnam War. &quot;I had just come back from Vietnam, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how absurd this movie was. So I laughed out loud, and I laughed and laughed. And it wasn&#x27;t long before the atmosphere around me grew very cold. My companion, who had been a Freedom Rider in the South, said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s get the hell out of here and run like hell.&#x27;&quot;

Film commentator Emanuel Levy noted in his retrospective review that Wayne was not attempting to promote the cause of the Vietnam War as much as he was trying to portray the Special Forces in their unique role in the military: &quot;Wayne said his motive was to glorify American soldiers as the finest fighting men &#x27;without going into why we are there, or if they should be there.&#x27; His &#x27;compulsion&#x27; to do the movie was based on his pride of the Special Forces, determined to show &#x27;what a magnificent job this still little-known branch of service is doing.&#x27; ... &#x27;I wasn&#x27;t trying to send a message out to anybody,&#x27; he reasoned, &#x27;or debating whether it is right or wrong for the United States to be in this war.&#x27;&quot;

Levy also notes that Wayne acknowledged that war is generally not popular, but the soldiers who serve face the risks and dangers of combat nonetheless, and must be prepared to sacrifice themselves, regardless of their personal will or judgment. Levy quotes Wayne: &quot;What war was ever popular for God&#x27;s sake? Those men don&#x27;t want to be in Vietnam any more than anyone else. Once you go over there, you won&#x27;t be middle-of-the-road.&quot;

In 2003, Richard Roeper, who was then the co-host of &quot;At the Movies&quot; with Roger Ebert, put &quot;The Green Berets&quot; on his list of his forty least favorite films of all time to that point. He called it &quot;Shameless propaganda [that l]ooks like it was produced by the Department of Defense and directed by Barry Goldwater.&quot;

&quot;The Green Berets&quot; holds a 23% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on thirteen reviews.

===Box office===
Despite the poor reviews, and despite being protested and picketed in the United States and abroad, it went on to be a commercial success, which Wayne attributed in part to the negative reviews from the press, which he saw as representing criticism of the war rather than the film.

&quot;The critics overkilled me, the picture and the war&quot;, said Wayne. &quot;As a result, so many people went to see it that I had a cheque from the distributors for $8 million within three months. That&#x27;s the cost of the picture, so we moved into profit the next day.&quot; &quot;The Green Berets&quot; earned rentals of $8.7 million in North America during 1968.

<doc id="1142327" wikidata="Q281113" url="?curid=1142327" title="Wales Office">
<text>The Wales Office (), known as the Office of the Secretary of State for Wales () between 2017 and 2024, is a department of His Majesty&#x27;s Government. It replaced the former Welsh Office, which had extensive responsibility for governing Wales prior to Welsh devolution in 1999.

== History ==
In the past, the Office was called &quot;Wales&#x27;s voice in Westminster and Westminster&#x27;s voice in Wales&quot;. However, it is significantly less powerful since the Government of Wales Act 2006: it is primarily responsible for carrying out the few functions remaining with the Secretary of State for Wales that have not been transferred already to the Senedd (Welsh Parliament); and for securing funds for Wales as part of the annual budgetary settlement.

The Secretary of State for Wales has overall responsibility for the office, but it is located administratively within the Ministry of Justice (until 2007, the Department for Constitutional Affairs).

==Ministers==
The ministers in the Wales Office are as follows, with cabinet members in bold:

Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, Wales does not have its own Law Officers of the Crown; it is part of the England and Wales legal jurisdiction. The Attorney General for England and Wales therefore advises the United Kingdom Government on its law. His deputy is the Solicitor General for England and Wales.

==Future==
Following the &#x27;yes&#x27; vote in the 2011 referendum on giving the Assembly direct law-making powers, some politicians in Wales, particularly from Plaid Cymru, have called for the abolition of the Wales Office. Lord Elis-Thomas, Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales, said:

However, Lord Elis-Thomas was accused of following a &quot;separatist agenda&quot; by the Conservative Cheryl Gillan, then Secretary of State for Wales. She was supported by her Labour predecessor Peter Hain, who declared that Wales &quot;still needs a voice around the Cabinet in Westminster&quot;.

<doc id="1142338" wikidata="Q673012" url="?curid=1142338" title="Pisco sour">
<text>A pisco sour is an alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian origin that is traditional to both Peruvian and Chilean cuisine. The drink&#x27;s name comes from &quot;pisco&quot;, a brandy which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term &quot;sour&quot;, implying sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian &quot;pisco&quot; and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean &quot;pisco&quot; and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.

Although the preparation of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly dates back to the 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris&#x27; Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are found in newspaper and magazine advertisements, dating to the early 1920s, for Morris and his bar published in Peru and Chile. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris&#x27; Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe for the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.

Cocktail connoisseurs consider the pisco sour a South American classic. Chile and Peru both claim the pisco sour as their national drink, and each asserts ownership of the cocktail&#x27;s base liquor—pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture. Media sources and celebrities commenting on the dispute often express their preference for one cocktail version over the other, sometimes just to cause controversy. Some pisco producers have noted that the controversy helps promote interest in the drink. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates yearly in honor of the cocktail on the first Saturday of February.

== Name ==
The term &quot;sour&quot; refers to mixed drinks containing a base liquor, lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener. &quot;Pisco&quot; refers to the base liquor used in the cocktail. The word as applied to the alcoholic beverage comes from the Peruvian port of Pisco. In the book &quot;Latin America and the Caribbean&quot;, historian Olwyn Blouet and political geographer Brian Blouet describe the development of vineyards in early Colonial Peru and how in the second half of the sixteenth century a market for the liquor formed owing to the demand from growing mining settlements in the Andes. Subsequent demand for a stronger drink caused Pisco and the nearby city of Ica to establish distilleries &quot;to make wine into brandy&quot;, and the product received the name of the port from where it was distilled and exported.

== History ==
=== Background ===

The first grapevines were brought to Peru shortly after its conquest by Spain in the 16th century. Spanish chroniclers from the time note the first winemaking in South America took place in the &quot;hacienda&quot; Marcahuasi of Cuzco. The largest and most prominent vineyards of the 16th and 17th century Americas were established in the Ica valley of south-central Peru. In the 1540s, Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes planted vineyards in Peru. Carabantes also established vineyards in Ica, where Spaniards from Andalucia and Extremadura introduced grapevines into Chile.

Already in the 16th century, Spanish settlers in Chile and Peru began producing aguardiente distilled from fermented grapes. Since at least 1764, Peruvian aguardiente was called &quot;pisco&quot; after its port of shipping; the usage of the name &quot;pisco&quot; for aguardiente then spread to Chile. The right to produce and market pisco, still made in Peru and Chile, is the subject of ongoing disputes between the two countries.

According to historian Luciano Revoredo, the preparation of pisco with lime dates as far back as the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the &quot;Mercurio Peruano&quot; which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima&#x27;s &quot;Plaza de toros de Acho&quot;, the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named &quot;Punche&quot; (Punch), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian pisco punch, invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of San Francisco, California. According to a 1921 news clip from the &quot;West Coast Leader&quot;, an English-language newspaper from Peru, a saloon in San Francisco&#x27;s Barbary Coast red-light district was known for its Pisco sours during &quot;the old pre-Volstead days&quot;. Culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that this attributes the popularity (not origin) of a pisco cocktail in San Francisco dating as far back as before the 1906 earthquake that destroyed the Barbary Coast. A recipe for a pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook &quot;Manual de Cocina a la Criolla&quot;; consequently, McDonnell considers that &quot;[i]t is entirely possible that the &#x27;Cocktail&#x27; that came to be the pisco sour ... had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook.&quot;

=== Origin ===
The pisco sour originated in Lima, Peru. It was created by bartender Victor Vaughen Morris, an American from a respected Mormon family of Welsh ancestry, who moved to Peru in 1904 to work in a railway company in Cerro de Pasco. Americans emigrated to the bustling Andean mining hub of Cerro de Pasco, then the second-largest city in Peru, for work in the business ventures established by the tycoon Alfred W. McCune. Morris, who worked as a floral shop manager in Salt Lake City, joined McCune&#x27;s project to construct what was then the highest-altitude railway in the world and ease the city&#x27;s export of its precious metals. During celebrations for the railway&#x27;s completion in July 1904, Morris, tasked with overseeing the festivities, recalled first mixing pisco in a cocktail beverage after the nearly 5,000 American and Peruvian attendees (including local celebrities and dignitaries) consumed all of the available whiskey.

Morris relocated to the Peruvian capital, Lima, with his Peruvian wife and three children in 1915. A year later, he opened a saloon—Morris&#x27; Bar—which became popular with both the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. Morris, who often experimented with new drinks, developed the pisco sour as a variant of the whiskey sour. Chilean historian Gonzalo Vial Correa also attributes the pisco sour&#x27;s invention to &quot;Gringo&quot; Morris from the Peruvian Morris Bar, but with the minor difference of naming him William Morris.

Some discrepancy exists on the exact date when Morris created the popular cocktail. Mixologist Dale DeGroff asserts the drink was invented in 1915, but other sources argue this happened in the 1920s. The Chilean web newspaper &quot;El Mercurio Online&quot; specifically contends historians attribute the year of the drink&#x27;s invention as 1922, adding that &quot;one night Morris surprised his friends with a new drink he called &quot;pisco sour&quot;, a formula which mixes the Peruvian &quot;pisco&quot; with the American &quot;sour&quot; (in Spanish: &quot;Una noche Morris sorprendió a sus amigos con una nueva bebida a la que llamó pisco sour, una fórmula que funde lo peruano del pisco con el &#x27;sour&#x27; estadounidense.&quot;&quot;).

The pisco sour&#x27;s initial recipe was that of a simple cocktail. According to Peruvian researcher Guillermo Toro-Lira, &quot;it is assumed that it was a crude mix of pisco with lime juice and sugar, as was the whiskey sour of those days.&quot; As the cocktail&#x27;s recipe continued to evolve, the bar&#x27;s registry shows that customers commented on the continuously improving taste of the drink. The modern Peruvian version of the recipe was developed by Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian from Chincha Alta who worked under the apprenticeship of Morris starting on July 16, 1924. Bruiget&#x27;s recipe added the Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix. Journalist Erica Duecy writes that Bruiget&#x27;s innovation added &quot;a silky texture and frothy head&quot; to the cocktail.

Morris used advertisements to promote his bar and invention. The oldest known mention of the pisco sour appears in the September 1920 edition of the Peruvian magazine &quot;Hogar&quot;. Another old advertisement appears in the April 22, 1921, edition of the Peruvian magazine &quot;Mundial&quot;. In the magazine, not only is the pisco sour described as a white-colored beverage but its invention is attributed to &quot;Mister Morris.&quot; Later, in 1924, with the aid of Morris&#x27; friend Nelson Rounsevell, the bar advertised its locale and invention in Valparaíso, Chile. The advertisement featured in the Valparaíso newspaper &quot;South Pacific Mail&quot;, owned by Rounsevell. By 1927, Morris&#x27; Bar had attained widespread notability for its cocktails, particularly the pisco sour. Brad Thomas Parsons writes that &quot;the registry at the Morris Bar was filled with high praise from visitors who raved about the signature drink.&quot;

Notable attendees of Morris&#x27; Bar included the writers Abraham Valdelomar and José María Eguren, the adventurers Richard Halliburton and Dean Ivan Lamb, the anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, and the businessmen Elmer Faucett and José Lindley. In his memoir, Lamb recalls his experience with the pisco sour in Morris&#x27; Bar, commenting that it &quot;tasted like a pleasant soft drink&quot; and that he felt disoriented after drinking a second one despite a bartender&#x27;s stern objection that &quot;one was usually sufficient.&quot;

=== Spread ===

Over time, competition from nearby bars and Victor Morris&#x27; deteriorating health led to the decline and fall of his enterprise. Due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the Hotel Bolívar and the Country Club Lima Hotel, housed bars that took clientele away from Morris&#x27; Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work in one of these competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary bankruptcy and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of cirrhosis.

Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris closed his bar, some of his bartenders left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. Sánchez, who in his youth also frequented Morris&#x27; Bar, writes in his memoir that two of Morris&#x27; other apprentices, Leonidas Cisneros Arteta and Augusto Rodríguez, opened their own bars.

As other former apprentices of Morris found work elsewhere, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. Since at least 1927, pisco sours started being sold in Chile, most notably at the Club de la Unión, a high-class gentlemen&#x27;s club in downtown Santiago. During the 1930s, the drink made its way into California, reaching bars as far north as the city of San Francisco. Restaurateur Victor Jules Bergeron, Jr., remembers serving pisco sours at the original Trader Vic&#x27;s tiki bar in Oakland, in 1934, to a traveler who had read about the cocktail in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. By at least the late 1960s, the cocktail also found its way to New York.

Beatriz Jiménez, a journalist from the Spanish newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot;, indicates that back in Peru, the luxury hotels of Lima adopted the pisco sour as their own in the 1940s. An oil bonanza attracted foreign attention to Peru during the 1940s and 1950s. In his 1943 guidebook promoting &quot;inter-American understanding&quot; during the Second World War, explorer Earl Parker Hanson writes that pisco and &quot;the famous pisco sour&quot; were favored by foreigners residing in Peru. Among the foreign visitors to Lima were renowned Hollywood actors who were fascinated by the pisco sour. Jiménez recollected oral traditions claiming an inebriated Ava Gardner had to be carried away by John Wayne after drinking too many pisco sours. Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles are said to have been big fans of what they described as &quot;that Peruvian drink.&quot; In his autobiography, actor Ray Milland recalls drinking the cocktail in Lima&#x27;s Government Palace during the Bustamante presidency of the 1940s, first finding it &quot;a most intriguing drink&quot; and then, after delivering a &quot;brilliant dedication speech&quot; whose success he partly attributed to the cocktail, charmingly referred to it as &quot;the lovely pisco sour.&quot;

In 1969, Sánchez wrote that the Hotel Maury still served the &quot;authentic&quot; Pisco sour from Morris&#x27; Bar. Pan American World Airways included the pisco sour in a drinking tips section for the 1978 edition of its &quot;Encyclopedia of Travel&quot; guidebook, warning travelers to Peru that &quot;[t]he pisco sour looks innocent, but is potent.&quot; Bolivian journalist Ted Córdova Claure wrote, in 1984, that the Hotel Bolívar stood as a monument to the decadence of the Peruvian oligarchy (in Spanish: &quot;Este hotel es un monumento a la decadencia de la oligarquía peruana.&quot;). He noted the locale as being the traditional home of the pisco sour and recommended it as one of the best hotels in Lima. Nowadays, the Hotel Bolivar continues to offer the cocktail in its &quot;El Bolivarcito&quot; bar, while the Country Club Lima Hotel offers the drink in its &quot;English Bar&quot; saloon.

== Preparation and variants ==
The pisco sour has three different methods of preparation. The Peruvian pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Peruvian pisco with Key lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, Angostura bitters (for garnish), and ice cubes. The Chilean pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with limón de Pica juice, powdered sugar, and ice cubes. Daniel Joelson, a food writer, and critic, contends that the major difference between both pisco sour versions &quot;is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not.&quot; The version from the International Bartenders Association, which lists the pisco sour among its &quot;New Era Drinks,&quot; is similar to the Peruvian version, but with the difference that it uses lemon juice, instead of lime juice, and does not distinguish between the two different types of pisco.

Considerable differences exist in the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the difference is in how both beverages are produced; whereas &quot;Chilean pisco is mass-produced,&quot; the Peruvian version &quot;is made in small batches.&quot; Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that &quot;[i]n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it is very similar to grappa. In Chile, pisco is made in a column still and aged in wood; it is similar to a very light cognac.&quot; Chilean oenologist Patricio Tapia adds that while Chilean pisco producers usually mix vine stocks, Peruvian producers have specific pisco types that use the aromatic qualities of vines such as Yellow Muscat and Italia. Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their vintage year and the Chilean versions do not.

Variations of the pisco sour exist in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. There are adaptations of the cocktail in Peru using fruits such as &quot;maracuya&quot; (commonly known as passion fruit), &quot;aguaymanto&quot;, and apples, or traditional ingredients such as the coca leaf. Lima&#x27;s Hotel Bolivar serves a larger version of the cocktail, named &quot;pisco sour catedral&quot;, invented for hurried guests arriving from the nearby Catholic cathedral. In Chile, variants include the ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), mango sour (with mango juice), and sour de campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunqueño variant (from its Yungas region) replaces the lime with orange juice.

Cocktails similar to the pisco sour exist in Chile and Peru. The Chilean piscola is made by mixing pisco with cola. The Algarrobina cocktail, popular in northern Peru, is made from pisco, condensed milk, and sap from the Peruvian &quot;algarroba&quot; tree. Other Peruvian pisco-based cocktails include the &quot;chilcano&quot; (made with pisco and ginger ale) and the &quot;capitán&quot; (made with pisco and vermouth). Another similar cocktail, from the United States, is the Californian pisco punch, originally made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.

== Popularity ==
Duggan McDonnell describes the pisco sour as &quot;Latin America&#x27;s most elegant cocktail, frothy, balanced, bright yet rich,&quot; adding that &quot;Barkeeps throughout Northern California will attest that they have shaken many a Pisco sour. It is the egg white cocktail of choice and an absolutely beloved one by most.&quot; Australian journalist Kate Schneider writes that the pisco sour &quot;has become so famous that there is an International Pisco Sour Day celebration on the first Saturday in February every year, as well as a Facebook page with more than 600,000 likes.&quot; According to Chilean entrepreneur Rolando Hinrichs Oyarce, owner of a restaurant-bar in Spain, &quot;The pisco sour is highly international, just like Cebiche, and so they are not too unknown&quot; (Spanish: &quot;&quot;El pisco sour es bastante internacional, al igual que el cebiche, por lo tanto no son tan desconocidos&quot;). In 2003, Peru created the &quot;Día Nacional del Pisco Sour&quot;&quot; (National Pisco Sour Day), an official government holiday celebrated on the first Saturday of February. During the 2008 APEC Economic Leaders&#x27; Meeting, Peru promoted its pisco sour with widespread acceptance. The cocktail was reportedly the preferred drink of the attendees, mostly leaders, businessmen, and delegates.

=== Origin dispute ===
Victor Vaughen Morris is considered by most historians to be the inventor of the pisco sour cocktail. Nonetheless, the cocktail&#x27;s traditional origin story is complicated with findings that suggest otherwise. Based on the recipe from the 1903 Peruvian cookbook &quot;Manual de Cocina a la Criolla&quot;, researcher Nico Vera considers that &quot;the origin of the Pisco Sour may be a traditional creole cocktail made in Lima over 100 years ago.&quot; Based on the clipping from the 1921 &quot;West Coast Leader&quot; news article, McDonnell considers it possible that the pisco sour may have actually originated in San Francisco, considering additionally that during this time the city experienced a &quot;burst of cocktail creativity,&quot; the whiskey sour cocktail &quot;was plentiful and ubiquitous,&quot; and &quot;the fact that Pisco was heralded as a special spirit&quot; in the city.

In defense of Morris, journalist Rick Vecchio considers that &quot;even if there was something very similar and pre-existing&quot; to Morris&#x27; pisco cocktail, it should not be doubted that he &quot;was the first to serve, promote and perfect what today is known as the Pisco Sour.&quot; McDonnell also considers that, regardless of its exact origin, the pisco sour &quot;belongs to Peru.&quot; According to culture writer Saxon Baird, a bust in honor of Morris stands in Lima&#x27;s Santiago de Surco district &quot;as a testament to Morris&#x27; contribution to modern Peruvian culture and the country he called home for more than half his life.&quot;

Despite this, an ongoing dispute exists between Chile and Peru over the origin of the pisco sour. In Chile, a local story developed in the 1980s attributing the invention of the pisco sour to Elliot Stubb, an English steward from a sailing ship named &quot;Sunshine&quot;. Chilean folklorist and historian Oreste Plath contributed to the legend&#x27;s propagation by writing that, according to the Peruvian newspaper &quot;El Comercio de Iquique&quot;, in 1872, after obtaining leave to disembark, Stubb opened a bar in the then-Peruvian port of Iquique and invented the pisco sour while experimenting with drinks. Nevertheless, researcher Toro-Lira argues that the story was refuted after it was discovered &quot;El Comercio de Iquique&quot; was actually referring to the invention of the whiskey sour. The story of Elliot Stubb and his alleged invention of the whiskey sour in Iquique is also found in a 1962 publication by the University of Cuyo, Argentina. An excerpt from the newspaper&#x27;s story has Elliot Stubb stating, &quot;From now on ... this shall be my drink of battle, my favorite drink, and it shall be named Whisky Sour&quot; (in Spanish: &quot;En adelante dijo Elliot — éste será mi trago de batalla, — mi trago favorito —, y se llamará Whisky Sour.&quot;).

Some pisco producers have expressed that the ongoing controversy between Chile and Peru helps promote interest in the liquor and its geographical indication dispute.

American celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain drew attention to the cocktail when, in an episode of his Travel Channel program &quot;No Reservations&quot;, he drank a pisco sour in Valparaíso, Chile, and said: &quot;that&#x27;s good, but ... next time, I&#x27;ll have a beer.&quot; The broadcaster Radio Programas del Perú reported that Jorge López Sotomayor, the episode&#x27;s Chilean producer and Bourdain&#x27;s travel partner in Chile, said Bourdain found the pisco sour he drank in Valparaíso boring and not worth the effort (in Spanish: &quot;&quot;A mí me dijo que el pisco sour lo encontró aburrido y que no valía la pena.&quot;). Lopez added that Bourdain had recently arrived from Peru, where he drank several pisco sours which he thought tasted better than the Chilean version.

In 2010, Mexican singer-songwriter Aleks Syntek humorously posted on Twitter that the pisco sour is Chilean and, after receiving critical responses to his statement, apologized and mentioned he was only joking. Mexican television host and comedian Adal Ramones also joked about pisco sour, about the 2009 Chile–Peru espionage scandal, on November 17, 2009. Ramones, a fan of Peruvian Pisco, when asked about the espionage, asked what Chileans were spying on in Peru, suggesting it might be how to make a pisco sour (in Spanish: &quot;¿Qué quieren espiar los chilenos? ¿Cómo hacer pisco sour?&quot;&quot;). In 2017, when told pisco sour was &quot;totally Chilean&quot; by an interviewer at a Chilean radio station, British musician Ed Sheeran commented that he preferred the Peruvian pisco sour.

<text>William Gregor (25 December 1761 – 11 June 1817) was a British clergyman and mineralogist who discovered the elemental metal Titanium.

==Early years==
He was born at the Trewarthenick Estate in Cornwall, the son of Francis Gregor and Mary Copley and the brother of Francis Gregor, MP for Cornwall. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School, where he became interested in chemistry, then after two years with a private tutor entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1784 and MA in 1787. He was ordained in the Church of England. He became vicar of St Mary&#x27;s Church Diptford near Totnes, Devon. He married Charlotte Anne Gwatkin in 1790 and they had one daughter, Charlotte-Anne Gregor.

==Discovery of titanium==
After a brief interval at Bratton Clovelly, in 1793 William and his family moved permanently to the rectory of Creed in Cornwall. Here he continued his remarkably accurate chemical analysis of minerals, most of which came from Cornwall, such as the zeolites found in gabbro on The Lizard. He also analysed wavellite, tourmaline, and the uranium minerals torbernite and autunite, the arsenate scorodite, the lead mineral mimetite and the nickel mineral niccolite, and others. But he is best known for one of his earliest discoveries: in 1791, while analysing the minerals in a black sand he had discovered in the Manaccan valley, he isolated the calx of an unknown metal which he named &quot;manaccanite&quot;. Later in 1791, Martin Heinrich Klaproth discovered what is now known as the transition metal, titanium in the mineral rutile. Believing this to be a new discovery, Klaproth named it &quot;titanium&quot; after the Titans of Greek Mythology, but eventually it was clarified that Gregor made the discovery first. Gregor was credited with the discovery, but the element kept the name chosen by Klaproth. Gregor later found titanium in corundum from Tibet, and in a tourmaline from a local tin mine.

==Death and legacy==
Gregor was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of London on its inception in 1807, and was a founding member of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall in 1814. His friends and correspondents included John Hawkins, Philip Rashleigh and John Ayrton Paris. Never letting his scientific work interfere with his pastoral duties, he was also a distinguished landscape painter, etcher and musician. He died of tuberculosis on 11 June 1817 and was buried at nearby Cornelly church.

<text>Farranfore () is a village in County Kerry, Ireland. It lies on the N22 road approximately midway between Tralee (10 miles or 17 km) and Killarney (9 miles or 15 km) and on the railway line connecting the two towns.

Farranfore came into existence as a turnpike; a gate at the cross-roads in the village marked the boundary of the lands of the Earls of Kenmare.

==Transport==
Between 1893 and 1960, Farranfore railway station, which opened on 18 July 1859, was known as Farranfore Junction, as it was the point where one boarded for the spectacular train ride to Valentia Harbour, which was the westernmost railway in Europe.

Farranfore is notable in particular for its nearby airport, known as Kerry Airport. The single runway at Farranfore saw intensive use when Ryanair opened a base at the airport in July 2008. Ryanair flies daily from Farranfore to London Stansted, London Luton and Frankfurt-Hahn. In the wake of its disagreements with Cork Airport, it announced that it was moving its Liverpool service from Cork to Farranfore from June 2006 (this service subsequently ended later that year).

<doc id="1142362" wikidata="Q2590962" url="?curid=1142362" title="University of Wisconsin–Platteville">
<text>University of Wisconsin–Platteville (UW–Platteville or UW Platt) is a public university in Platteville, Wisconsin, United States. Part of the University of Wisconsin System, it offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees across three colleges and enrolls approximately 6,500 students as of 2022.

==History==
The university grew from the 1959 merger of two schools: Wisconsin State College, Platteville, and the Wisconsin Institute of Technology. WSC–Platteville was founded in 1866 as Platteville Normal School, the first teacher preparation school in Wisconsin. It was renamed Platteville State Teachers College in 1926 and Wisconsin State College, Platteville in 1951. The Wisconsin Institute of Technology, founded in 1907 as the Wisconsin Mining Trade School, was founded to train technicians for the numerous mining operations around Platteville. It evolved into the first three-year program for mining engineers in the United States. It changed its name to the Wisconsin Institute of Technology in 1939.

The merged school took the name Wisconsin State College and Institute of Technology in 1959. In 1966, along with Wisconsin&#x27;s other state colleges, it was granted university status as Wisconsin State University–Platteville. It took its current name, the University of Wisconsin–Platteville, after the Wisconsin State University system merged with the University of Wisconsin in 1971.

Starting in the late 1960s, the University of Wisconsin–Platteville expanded its academic program and established new colleges, the largest being a business college. The mining college was transformed into an engineering college encompassing mining, electrical, mechanical, and eventually electronic engineering. In the late 1980s, the mining engineering degree was phased out because of falling enrollment. By that time it had been overshadowed by the other engineering degrees.

From 1984 to 2000, the Chicago Bears of the National Football League held pre-season training camp at UW–Platteville. They were considered a member of the &quot;Cheese League&quot; that in 1999 consisted of the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs, with each team practicing at a different university in Wisconsin. In 2001, the Illinois General Assembly asked the Bears to move to an Illinois practice facility in order to raise funds for remodeling Soldier Field. Before the Bears left, they donated $250,000 to UW–Platteville for a new computer lab, which was named &quot;The Bears Den&quot;.

In the 1980s, UW–Platteville made an effort to bring businesses to the Platteville area to take advantage of university resources. Rockwell Automation started this trend in the 1980s when it recruited two engineering professors at UW–Platteville to start an engineering firm. Rockwell provided financing and awarded them major contracts. The resulting business was Insight Industries, which later changed to AVISTA Inc. (now a division of Esterline, Inc.).

On June 16, 2014, an EF2 tornado struck the UW–Platteville campus, causing $18.6 million in damage.

The Agriculture and Manual Arts Building/Platteville State Normal School, now known as Ullrich Hall, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2018, the University of Wisconsin System restructured through the Collaborative Integration Project, which bound the University of Wisconsin Colleges to the Universities. The University of Wisconsin-Richland and the University of Wisconsin-Baraboo/Sauk County were joined with Platteville as branch campuses, and renamed the University of Wisconsin–Platteville Richland and the University of Wisconsin–Platteville Baraboo/Sauk County respectively.

==Campus==

The University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UW–Platteville) campus is 821 acres in size:
Campus proper: 362 acres
Pioneer Farm: 400 acres
The mound: 90 acres

Land Management Plan
Since 2015, UW‐Platteville has had a written plan to guide decisions affecting the 362 acres of our campus. This plan establishes a broad scope for how we plan to oversee our land in the future and strives to responsibly invest in and steward our 120 acres of open space.

UW–Platteville&#x27;s campus has no city streets that cut through campus. During the 1960s, all city streets and parking lots within the campus were replaced with wide sidewalks and manicured lawns.

UW–Platteville has 13 residence halls. Southwest Hall opened in the fall of 2006. To accommodate a rapidly growing student body, Rountree Commons opened in August 2012 and Bridgeway Commons opened in August 2013.

Ullsvik Hall, renovated and expanded between 2006 and 2008, houses administrative offices, academic facilities, visitor center, and other support departments. It also has banquet and catering facilities, including the Robert I. Velzy Commons, and the Nohr Art Gallery.

In 2002, a new student union, the Markee Pioneer Student Center, was opened at the center of campus. The new location makes the student union the heart of the campus. The union also serves as a technology and activity hub with a large computer lab (the Bear&#x27;s Den), an involvement center, and on-campus activities. The union houses three of eight dining complexes, the Pioneer Crossing, Pioneer Haus, and The Pioneer Perk. The other location for food on campus is Bridgeway Commons, located in the residence hall section of campus. In 2011 the student center building was named the Markee Pioneer Student Center, after former Chancellor David Markee and his wife Lou Ann.

==Organization and administration==
The university is part of the University of Wisconsin System, and has an administrative staff headed by a Chancellor. Its colleges are headed by deans and departments chairpersons who report to the deans.
The university consists of three colleges that offer bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees:
* The College of Business, Industry, Life Sciences and Agriculture – offering programs in modern business and industrial applications, biology and agricultural sciences.
* The College of Liberal Arts and Education – with programs in humanities, social sciences (such as psychology), fine arts and education
* The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Science – consisting of electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil/environmental, computer science, software engineering, chemistry, engineering physics, and mathematics.

==Academics==

In 2004, UWP received approval from the UW system to increase its enrollment from 5,500 to 7,500 students. UWP started a program called the Tri-State Initiative, which aims to attract prospective students from Illinois and Iowa. The enrollment of UWP, as of Spring 2008, stood at 7,795 undergraduates and 830 graduate students. As of 2004, UWP was staffed by 336 faculty.

In 1978, the University introduced print-based courses to enable Wisconsin residents living in isolated areas to earn an undergraduate degree in business administration without having to travel to a university campus. In 1996, the residency requirement was amended and the distance program was extended to working adults living throughout the United States. In 1999, online graduate programs in criminal justice, engineering, and project management were introduced, allowing students throughout the world to earn an accredited degree at a distance from UWP. In addition to accredited degree programs, UWP has also developed online leadership and management courses in association with the Wisconsin Department of Justice and on-site project management courses in association with a project management consulting company.

==Student life==
Of the student body, over 3,700 live in campus residence halls, with a growing number of students staying in town during the weekends. Students who don&#x27;t live on campus typically live in houses off-campus which are rented by the year. The local music scene has been active, producing several bands a year.

UW–Platteville has over 250 clubs and organizations. The student newspaper, &quot;The Exponent&quot;, is published weekly by a student staff. The student radio station, WSUP, is the oldest radio station in the UW system.

The largest celebration by UW–Platteville students is the twice-annual lighting of the Platte Mound M. The &quot;M&quot; is located on Platte Mound, a nearby large hill east of the city of Platteville.

Each Spring, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby clubs host Mudfest on campus, a large fifteen-style rugby tournament for teams around the Midwest.

==Athletics==
UW–Platteville is a member of the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 14 sports, including football and basketball. The teams are nicknamed &quot;the Pioneers&quot;. Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, football, indoor and outdoor track and field, cross country, wrestling, soccer, and baseball. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, soccer, indoor and outdoor track and field, volleyball, cross country, golf, softball, and cheerleading. All teams compete in NCAA Division III and Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. There are also a number of club sports teams such as hockey and lacrosse which are partially funded through the university. The Ralph E. Davis Pioneer Stadium is home to the football team, lacrosse team, and soccer team. Williams Fieldhouse is home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams.

The men&#x27;s basketball team won NCAA Division III championships in 1991, 1995, 1998, and 1999. The Pioneers qualified for the Division III men&#x27;s basketball tournament from 1991-1999 and returned 10 years later in 2009. Bo Ryan, who later became head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers, guided the Pioneers to a 353-76 record and the best winning percentage in NCAA Division III basketball. Ryan established one of the best home court advantages of all time as the Pioneers only lost 5 games at home in a decade. The team averaged 26 wins a season in the 1990s, when the Division III men&#x27;s regular season schedule only allowed 25 games per year. The university named the basketball floor &quot;Bo Ryan Court&quot; in January 2007.

<text>The 47th (1/2nd London) Division was an infantry division of the British Army, raised in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force.

==Formation==
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. One of the divisions was the 2nd London Division. In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was, from 1912, in the Duke of York&#x27;s Headquarters.

==First World War==
The 2nd London Division was designated the 47th Division in 1915, during the Great War, and referred to as the &quot;1/2nd London Division&quot; after the raising of the second-line 60th (2/2nd London) Division.

The division was sent to France in March 1915, one of the first Territorial divisions to enter the fighting, and served on the Western Front for the duration of the war.

In early 1916 the division was part of Lieutenant General Sir Henry Wilson&#x27;s IV Corps. Wilson was not impressed by Charles Barter, the 47th&#x27;s general officer commanding (GOC), and at the end of March 1916 he and his superior, General Sir Charles Monro (GOC First Army and a former GOC of the 2nd London Division), discussed getting rid of him, but could not come up with a reason for doing so; Barter survived until he was relieved during the Battle of the Somme later in the year and replaced by Major General G. F. Gorringe.

The 47th Division conducted effective mining operations against Vimy Ridge on 3 and 15 May 1916, but a German attack on the evening of Sunday 21 May moved forward 800 yards, capturing 1,000 yards of the British front line, and the division performed badly during a counterattack on 23 May. The 47th Division conducted a carefully planned single battalion raid on the night of 27–8 June, claiming to have killed 300–600 Germans for only 13 British casualties.

In the final stages of the war the division&#x27;s GSO1 (effectively chief of staff) was the thirty-year old Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Montgomery.

The division fought in the Battle of Aubers Ridge, the Battle of Festubert, the Battle of Loos, the 1 July 1916 Battle of the Somme, including the Battle of Flers-Courcelette and the capture of High Wood. After mid-1916 battles included the Battle of Le Transloy, the Battle of Messines, and the Battle of Cambrai.

The division was reformed in 1920. By 1935 the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence, particularly for London, was addressed by converting the 47th Division into the 1st Anti-Aircraft Division.

==Second World War==

During the Second World War, the division was once again raised, this time as a duplicate of the 1st London Division, initially as the 2nd London Division, but was redesignated in November 1940 as the 47th (London) Infantry Division.

==Commanders==
The following officers commanded 47th Division throughout its existence:
==Memorial==

Two wooden memorial crosses erected at High Wood and Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye by 47 Divisional Engineers in 1916 were falling into disrepair by 1925, when they were replaced in stone. The restored wooden crosses were preserved at the Duke of York&#x27;s Headquarters in London (the former divisional HQ) until that building was sold in 2003, and are now at Connaught House, the HQ of the London Irish Rifles on the site of the former First Surrey Rifles drill hall at Flodden Road, Camberwell.

<doc id="1142382" wikidata="Q761408" url="?curid=1142382" title="Springs, South Africa">
<text>Springs is a former independent city that is now part of the City of Ekurhuleni, based in the east of Johannesburg (East Rand), in Gauteng Province, South Africa. It lies east of Johannesburg and southeast from Pretoria. Its name derives from the large number of springs in the area, and its estimated population is more than 121,610 in 2011. It is situated at above sea level.

During the apartheid-era, the city was racially segregated under the Group Areas Act. These consisted of middle and upper-income white suburbs around the city centre and the Indian area of Bakerton east of the CBD. A community of black Africans were living in a &quot;black spot&quot; of Springs known as Payneville. The Town Council ordered the creation of a new black township to relieve overcrowding in Payneville. In the 1950s the residents were forcibly removed and relocated to the newly created, KwaThema, southwest of the CBD.

Springs has a high concentration of Art Deco architecture. After Miami in Florida, it has the highest number of small-scale Art Deco buildings in the world.

Nadine Gordimer (1923 - 2014), the first South African Nobel Laureate in Literature (1991), was born and raised in Springs. 

==History==

The town of Springs, east of Johannesburg, is on the East Rand, or what is now known as the Metropolitan area of Ekurhuleni, in the Gauteng Province. It was founded as a coal and gold mining town in 1904, but its history can be traced back to the second half of the 19th century.

From about 1840 farmers moved into the area and declared farms for themselves, especially after the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic, later Transvaal) became an independent republic with the signing of the Sand River Convention in 1852. These initial farms were large, but the measurements of the borders were inaccurate and later, when the correct borders of the farms had to be documented, there were several extra or odd pieces of land that did not belong to any farm. These odd pieces of land then became state property. Such an odd piece existed between three neighbouring farms on the Witwatersrand, namely Geduld (meaning &#x27;patience&#x27;), De Rietfontein (&#x27;the reed fountain&#x27;) and Brakpan (literally, &#x27;small, brackish lake&#x27;).

The 685 ha odd piece was given the name &#x27;The Springs&#x27; by the land surveyor James Brooks, probably because of all the fountains on the land. Another story is that he wanted to name it after himself, but because his name (Brooks) resembled the Afrikaans word &#x27;broek&#x27; (trousers) so closely, he feared that the Afrikaans farmers in the area would mock it.

On 16 September 1884 the official map of The Springs was registered in Pretoria, the Republic&#x27;s capital. Initially, the land&#x27;s value was equal to R200. But the discovery of coal and gold and its subsequent mining increased the value considerably.

The coal discovered in The Springs was of a good quality and in 1888 the first contract was signed to mine coal there. Initially mining was on a small scale, but rose when the Great Eastern mine was established. There were a number of corrugated iron houses around the mine and, although there was a few small hotels and general dealers, it was not a town yet. The settlement grew and in 1902 a health committee was appointed to look after the building and location of structures and also the hygiene in the growing township. In 1904 the Grootvlei Proprietary Mines were registered and shafts were sunk. This followed the discovery in 1899 of gold on the farm Geduld and the further discovery of the main reef in 1902.

In April 1904, The Springs was proclaimed a town, called Springs, the health committee replaced by a town council, and it flourished as a mining town. In 1962, Springs produced 10% of the country&#x27;s gold and 9% of its uranium. However, by the end of the 1960s the last mine in town, the Daggafonteinmyn, (literally: Marijuana fountain mine) was emptied. The town did not die, but instead developed into an industrial centre.

The original 7 km2 farm on which the city of Springs was later to be built, &quot;The Springs&quot;, was surveyed in 1883. Coal was discovered in the area in 1887 and three years later in 1890–1891, the Transvaal Republic&#x27;s first railway, the Randtram Line, was built by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) to carry coal from the East Rand coalfields to the gold mines of the Witwatersrand.

Gradually, especially after coal was discovered further east in South Africa in Witbank, the Springs collieries were closed. In the meanwhile, however, gold had also been discovered in the area. A village was laid out in 1904 and in 1908 the first gold mining began. Springs was granted municipal status in 1912. By the late 1930s, there were eight gold mines near Springs, making it the largest single gold-producing area in the world.

Springs is currently one of the industrial centers of the Witwatersrand and also the Eastern Gateway of Gauteng towards Mpumalanga and Northern Kwazulu Natal. Mining has been replaced by manufacturing and engineering industries of economic importance; products of the region include processed metals, chemicals, paper and foodstuffs.

Springs is known for its high concentration of Art Deco architecture, as it is home to the second-highest number of small scale Art Deco buildings in the world, after Miami in Florida. These Art Deco buildings were mostly constructed in the CBD during interwar period Interwar period of the early twentieth century. This was also the greatest growth period in the city. The style of architecture evoked sophistication and wealth, employed to &quot;counteract the incipient provincialism associated with a colonial city.&quot; In 1998, Micha Birch, then a member of the National Monuments Council, approached the municipality about arranging an exhibition of the city&#x27;s Art Deco architecture.

Art Deco examples include the Central Fire Station, built by the Mr Anifantakis architect 1938 and designed by a Mr Anifantakis. A number are also known for their graphic artwork and letter work, notably seen in the Court Chambers, Renesta House, Palladium Cinema and Nureef House.

<text>La Linea (&quot;The Line&quot;) is an Italian animated series created by the Italian cartoonist Osvaldo Cavandoli. The series consists of 90 episodes, which were originally broadcast on the Italian channel RAI between 1971 and 1986. The background tune for the series was created by Franco Godi.

The series features a man known as &quot;Mr. Linea&quot; (voiced by Carlo Bonomi in a grammelot similar to the Milanese dialect) drawn as a single outline of an infinite line, which encounters various obstacles during his walking, and often turns to the cartoonist, represented as a live-action hand holding a pencil, to draw him a solution. All episodes are short subjects, ranging from 2:30 to 6:40 in runtime.

The series aired in more than 50 countries around the world; due to the short length of episodes, it has often been used in many networks as an interstitial program, including in the United States. Over the years, &quot;La Linea&quot; gained a widespread popularity worldwide, and it is considered to be a cult classic. It also spawned a comic strip, books, additional short movies, merchandising gadgets and objects, and countless homages and parodies, with many appearances of the protagonist in other media.

Even though the episodes are numbered up to 225, there are actually 90 &quot;La Linea&quot; episodes. The 1971 series had 8 episodes, the 1978 series had 56 (101–156), and the 1986 series had 26 (200–225). All episodes of the series are also available on DVD.

== Synopsis ==
The cartoon features a man (known as &quot;Mr. Linea&quot;) drawn as a single outline around his silhouette, walking on an infinite line of which he is a part. The character encounters obstacles and often turns to the cartoonist, represented as a live-action hand holding a white grease pencil, to draw him a solution, with various degrees of success. One recurring obstacle was an abrupt end of the line. The character would often almost fall off the edge into oblivion and get angry with the cartoonist and complain about it.

==Production history==

In 1969, Osvaldo Cavandoli proposed his character &quot;Mr. Linea&quot; to some advertising agencies that made films for &quot;Carosello&quot;. The character pleased the engineer Emilio Lagostina, art collector and owner of the pressure cooker industry Lagostina, who wanted him to be the protagonist of some commercials for his company.

The presentation of the character, initially called &quot;Agostino Lagostina&quot; (the name was later removed after the first series) was: &quot;Who is Agostino? A lively little man, with a truly expressive nose, with all the concerns and concerns of modern life. Son of a pencil and a hand.&quot;

The character was voiced by Carlo Bonomi in a mock version of Milanese that resembled gibberish as much as possible, with occasional Italian or English words, giving the cartoon the possibility to be easily exported without dubbing. The voice resembles Pingu, which was also voiced by Bonomi. The background tune for the series was edited by Franco Godi and Corrado Tringali.

The first 8 episodes of the series were created to publicize Lagostina kitchenware products, and the accompanying narration identified Mr. Linea. After the series broke its association with Lagostina, the character became the protagonist of his own television series, which enjoyed huge success worldwide. Over 90 episodes were produced.

==International broadcast==

From 1972 on &quot;La Linea&quot; was shown on numerous TV stations in Europe as well as in cinema, mostly as interstitial between commercials. &quot;La Linea&quot; was shown in more than 50 countries over the world. The series won prizes 1972 in Annecy and 1973 in Zagreb.

Not all &quot;La Linea&quot; cartoons were featured on the show, as some had a mature theme and were therefore considered inappropriate for children.

* In the Netherlands, &quot;La Linea&quot; was aired on VPRO in 1978, 1985 and 1988.

<doc id="1142385" wikidata="Q380085" url="?curid=1142385" title="Theodor Kittelsen">
<text>Theodor Severin Kittelsen (27 April 1857 – 21 January 1914) was a Norwegian artist. He is one of the most popular artists in Norway. Kittelsen became famous for his nature paintings, as well as for his illustrations of fairy tales and legends, especially of trolls.

==Early life==
Kittelsen was born in the coastal town of Kragerø in Grenland, Norway. His father died when he was young, leaving a wife and eight children in difficult circumstances. Theodor was only 11 years old when he was apprenticed to a watchmaker. When at the age of 17 his talent was discovered by Diderich Maria Aall, he became a pupil at Wilhelm von Hannos drawing school in Christiania (now Oslo). Because of generous financial support by Aall he later studied in Munich. However, in 1879 Diderich Aall could no longer manage to support him, so Kittelsen had to earn his money as a draftsman for German newspapers and magazines.

==Career==
In 1882, Kittelsen was granted a state scholarship to study in Paris, though he would return to Munich at his own expense by the following year. In 1887, he returned to Norway for good, where he would find inspiration in the surrounding nature. He spent the next two years in Lofoten, where he lived with his sister and brother-in-law at Skomvær Lighthouse. Kittelsen also started to write texts to his drawings there.

Kittelsen and his family settled in a home and artist studio which he called Lauvlia near Prestfoss during 1899, where he would spend his best artistic years. During this period, Kittelsen was hired to illustrate Norwegian Folktales (Norwegian: &quot;Norske Folkeeventyr&quot;) by the Norwegian folklore collector Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe. In 1908 he was made Knight of The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. However, he was forced to sell and leave Lauvlia in 1910 due to failing health. Kittelsen was granted an artist’s stipend in 1911; he died in Jeløya in 1914. After his death, his widow Inga Kittelsen was granted an annual salary from the Storting.

==Style==
Kittelsen&#x27;s style had elements of Neo-Romantic and naïve painting. As a national artist he is highly respected and well known in Norway, but doesn&#x27;t receive much international attention, which is the reason that his name is often not included in registers of internationally recognized painters and artists.

==Dedicated museums==
*Lauvlia, his home from 1899 to 1910, is located in Sigdal north of Prestfoss along Highway Fv287, with scenic view of Lake Soneren. The surrounding area, in particular Mount Andersnatten which overlooks the lake a few kilometres north, inspired some of Kittelsen&#x27;s most famous landscapes. Today Lauvlia is a private museum featuring an exhibition of Kittelsen’s original work. Lauvlia is decorated with Kittelsen&#x27;s own woodcarvings and murals. A new exhibition of original Kittelsen works is opened each year with painting and drawing activities arranged for children. The paintings exhibited are rotated each year.
* Theodor Kittelsen Museum at Blaafarveværket is at the Skuterudhøyden ridge by the Cobalt Mines. Kittelsen’s poetical interpretations of nature, the forest, the mountains and trolls are presented in the form of carved furniture, oil paintings, watercolours and drawings. New exhibitions each year. In 2014 are Blaafarveværket in charge of arranging the biggest exhibition held ever in modern times.
*The house where the artist grew up in Kragerø is also currently a museum devoted to his legacy.

==Cultural references==
Black metal and folk metal bands such as Burzum, Empyrium, Otyg and Satyricon have used some of his pictures as album art, notably illustrations taken from Kittelsen&#x27;s book &quot;Svartedauen&quot; (The Black Death). Musician Phil Elverum named the tenth song on his 2017 album A Crow Looked at Me after Kittelesen&#x27;s painting &quot;Soria Moria&quot; specifically, using it as an illustration of his grief. Kittelsen&#x27;s 160th birthday was celebrated in a Google doodle on 27 April 2017, giving him some exposure outside of Norway.

<text>Corinne Marie-Madeleine Geneviève Pierrette Picolo (born 23 March 1950), better known as Corinne Cléry, is a French actress. Her breakthrough role was as the title character in &quot;Story of O&quot; (1975), based on the novel of the same name. She subsequently had significant career in Italian cinema, and also played Corinne Dufour in the James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979).

==Early life and career==
Cléry was born on 23 March 1950 near Paris and raised in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. She began her acting career in the late 1960s under the name Corinne Piccoli. Her first important film was Joël Le Moigne&#x27;s &quot;Les Poneyttes&quot; with Johnny Hallyday and DJ Hubert Wayaffe, whom she married at the end of the filming, aged 17.

Cléry first came to prominence in the movie &quot;Story of O&quot; (1975) (&quot;Histoire d&#x27;O&quot;). She also modelled for the cover of French magazine &quot;Lui&quot; in which she is holding a huge copy of the novel upon which the film is based.

Cléry is also known for playing Bond girl Corinne Dufour, antagonist Hugo Drax&#x27;s assistant, in the 1979 James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot;. She also starred with Bond girl Barbara Bach (who played Anya Amasova in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;) and Richard Kiel (who played Bond villain Jaws) in the film &quot;The Humanoid&quot; (1979). Following &quot;Moonraker&quot;, she appeared in several Italian language films. She also starred in the films &quot;Covert Action&quot;, &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; with actor David Hess, Sergio Corbucci&#x27;s &quot;The Con Artists&quot; with Adriano Celentano and Anthony Quinn, and the science fiction film &quot;Yor, the Hunter from the Future&quot;.

Cléry became a housemate in the second season of &quot;Grande Fratello VIP&quot;, the Italian adaptation of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

She considers herself anti-communist and atheist.

<doc id="1142399" wikidata="Q1636527" url="?curid=1142399" title="The Quick Draw McGraw Show">
<text>The Quick Draw McGraw Show is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, and their third television series overall after &quot;The Ruff and Reddy Show&quot; and &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;. Voice actor Daws Butler performed the show&#x27;s title character, Quick Draw McGraw.

The show debuted in syndication on September 28, 1959, ending its run on October 20, 1961, and was sponsored by Kellogg&#x27;s. The series featured three cartoons per episode, with Quick Draw and his sidekick Baba Looey appearing in the first segment, father and son dog duo Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy in the second, and cat and mouse detectives Snooper and Blabber in the third. There were also &quot;bumpers,&quot; mini-cartoons between the main cartoons that featured Quick Draw and other main characters on the show.

Michael Maltese wrote the stories of all the episodes. Screen Gems, the television division at the time of Columbia Pictures, originally syndicated the series. It ran on Saturday mornings on CBS for one season, 1965-66.

==Segments==

===Quick Draw McGraw===

Quick Draw (voiced by Daws Butler) was usually depicted as a sheriff in these short films set in the American Old West. Quick Draw was often accompanied by his deputy, a Mexican burro called Baba Looey (also voiced by Butler). Although technically the side-kick, or deputy, to the main character of Sheriff Quick Draw, Baba Looey is often portrayed as the more thoughtful half of the duo; at times realizing some detail about a given situation and trying desperately without success to caution Quick Draw of a trap or other danger. The exchange would always go as follows: Baba Looey would see a fatal flaw in Quick Draw&#x27;s plan, and begin voicing a warning such as &quot;I don&#x27; thin&#x27; we should be doing...&quot;, to which Quick Draw would angrily interrupt with his frequent catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;ll do the &#x27;thin&#x27;in&#x27; around here and don&#x27;t you forget it!&quot; His plans would then go disastrously wrong, and Quick Draw would be forced to realize he should have listened to Baba Looey.

Quick Draw was assisted in some cartoons by his bloodhound Snuffles (voiced by Butler), who refused to work until he was given a dog biscuit, after which he would hug himself and spring into the air, floating back down to Earth.

Quick Draw spent a number of cartoons as his alter ego, the masked El Kabong, who used a guitar (a &quot;Kabonger&quot;) to bash bad guys into submission. Writer Michael Maltese said the character was inspired by actor Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. as Zorro.

===Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy===

A young dog named Augie Doggie (voiced by Daws Butler) and his father Doggie Daddy (voiced by Doug Young impersonating Jimmy Durante) have different misadventures in their life.

===Snooper and Blabber===

A detective cat named Super Snooper (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Ed Gardner as the character Archie from the radio show &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;) and his sidekick Blabber Mouse (also voiced by Butler, originally voiced by Los Angeles radio announcer Elliot Field) work for the Super Snooper Detective Agency solving mysteries and catching criminals. In several cartoons, the duo had a private secretary named Hazel (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl with a Southern accent), who was never seen on screen.

==Home media==
Season sets of the series for the &quot;Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection&quot; label were originally announced by Warner Bros. for release in 2006, but were later cancelled due to the poor condition of the masters as well as the music rights issues. In 2006, a Warner spokesperson said of the DVDs, &quot;They were pulled because significant remastering work needed to be researched.&quot; Four episodes are available on DVD, the first two episodes on &quot;Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s: Vol. One&quot; and the other two on &quot;Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s: Vol. Two&quot;.

==Baba Booey mispronunciation==
On the July 26, 1990, broadcast of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, executive producer Gary Dell&#x27;Abate was talking about the animation cels that he buys and collects. When attempting to say &#x27;Quick Draw and Baba Looey&#x27;, he accidentally said &#x27;Quick Draw and Baba Booey&#x27;. He said later that talking about it would last a few hours. But since then, hundreds of &#x27;Baba Booey&#x27; song parodies have been played on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. In addition, &#x27;Baba Booey&#x27; was often yelled out during live news broadcasts. Until recently, it was also frequently yelled at golf tournaments after the ball was struck.

<doc id="1142417" wikidata="Q44882" url="?curid=1142417" title="Godfried Danneels">
<text>Godfried Maria Jules Danneels (4 June 1933 – 14 March 2019) was a Belgian Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels and the chairman of the Episcopal Conference of Belgium from 1979 to 2010. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983.

==Early life and studies==
Born in Kanegem, West Flanders, Godfried Danneels was the eldest of six siblings. He owed his vocation to the priesthood to a priest he had as a teacher in high school, Daniel Billiet. Like a few other bright candidates for the priesthood from West Flanders, Danneels did not enter the episcopal Seminary of Bruges after he finished high school, but was sent directly to the Higher Institute of Philosophy of the Catholic University of Leuven, there to follow a three-year course of Neo Scholastic philosophy (1951–1954). Leuven, with which he remained &quot;in love&quot; his entire life, opened the world for him intellectually. From Leuven he was sent to Rome, where he studied Catholic theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University whilst living in the Belgian Papal College (1954–1959). With a few exceptions, he judged the quality of his courses there inferior to those in Leuven, but Rome greatly enriched him culturally. Danneels obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in June 1956, his license in 1958, and his doctorate in 1961.

His results as a student were uniformly very good, including an A− for canon law, and a &quot;magna cum laude&quot; for his license.

==Ordination==
Well before the end of his studies, he was ordained to the priesthood by Emiel Jozef De Smedt, Bishop of Bruges, in a ceremony in the Kanegem parish church on 17 August 1957, the 25th wedding anniversary of his parents.

==Professor and pastor==
In 1959, De Smedt appointed him spiritual director of the Bruges episcopal seminary and at the same time professor of liturgy and spirituality. In 1960 he also took over Frans Neirynck&#x27;s course on the sacraments.

His study of the literature on liturgy made him evolve from a Rome-educated and initially conservative liturgist into a modern one, and a well-known one, thanks to his articles in the &quot;Dictionary of the Liturgy&quot;. The claim that he was actively involved in writing &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot; is dubious, for he did not attend the Second Vatican Council. But he did play a very active role in the implementation of the liturgical reforms of &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;, not only in the Bruges diocese, but in all of Belgium and even abroad. He was very much taken with these reforms, for in Belgium and the Netherlands many had been foreshadowed in liturgical experiments. However, he did not call for liturgical revolution in his writings and talks, favoring steady and measured innovation instead. Even so, from the middle sixties he felt pressurized by Rome (in particular by cardinal Giacomo Lercaro), which was trying get a firmer grip on the liturgical journals in which he wrote.

On 8 July 1969, Danneels was appointed assistant professor at the Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Leuven. Initially the appointment was for two years, but Danneels was to stay until 31 January 1978, shortly after he was consecrated bishop. In Leuven he became thoroughly interested in what was to become his &quot;hobby horse&quot;, the interlocking of theology and humanism, which he was to develop throughout his life in both his academic and his pastoral writings. The latter too were numerous and important, for when he was relieved of his spiritual directorship at the Bruges seminar in the summer of 1967, he was put in charge of the continuing education of the priests of the Bruges diocese.

==Bishop==

On 4 November 1977, Danneels was named Bishop of Antwerp by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 18 December from Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens; co-consecrators were his predecessor Jules Victor Daem and his Bruges bishop De Smedt. The consecration, in a Dutch-language rite in whose development Danneels himself had been involved as a liturgist, took place in St. James&#x27;, as the Antwerp cathedral was being restored at the time.

Three days after his consecration he invited Catholics to write him &quot;personally&quot; with suggestions for their new bishop and he made the rounds of his diocese to consult with people. He used the media, extensively and successfully, to expound his vision of Christian humanism. In this he can be claimed to have been &quot;modern&quot;. But in many ways he was traditional and careful of what Rome desired. From the beginning of his episcopacy, he faced an acute problem of numerous priests leaving their ministry. In spite of this, he energetically defended the traditional demand of the Church that priests remain celibate. In July 1978 he was appointed a member of the Curial Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, just at the time when Edward Schillebeeckx was first investigated by the Congregation. In the face of great pressure from the Leuven Faculty of Theology, he did not intervene on Schillebeeckx&#x27;s behalf.

Encouraged and aided by his predecessor, Danneels began to build what was to become a very extensive network, which included numerous Belgian politicians. This would be important for his work in the next station of his life.

==Archbishop and cardinal==
===Promotion to archbishop and creation as cardinal===
Danneels was promoted to the Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussels on 19 December 1979. He thus became Primate of Belgium, president of the Belgian Conference of Catholic Bishops, chancellor of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the Université catholique de Louvain and head of the nation&#x27;s Catholic military ordinariate, at first as vicar, from 1987 as bishop.

Pope John Paul II followed the tradition that the Mechelen archbishop be made a cardinal, and created him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Anastasia in the consistory of 2 February 1983.

===Survey of his career as cardinal-archbishop===
There are two rather distinct periods in Danneels&#x27; career as Cardinal-Archbishop. In its first ten to fifteen years, Danneels&#x27; relations with Rome were excellent. He was appointed to a number of pontifical congregations and councils. In addition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, to which he had already been appointed in 1978, he was a member of:
* the Congregation for Bishops
* the Congregation for the Clergy
* the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples
* the Congregation for Catholic Education
* the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments
* the Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers
He was also a member of the permanent secretariat of the episcopal synod and participated in a number of synods
But his own enthusiasm about the government of the Church by the Vatican waned. He did not approve of the way Pope John Paul II restricted the role of bishops&#x27; conferences like CELAM (1992) and especially of CCEE (1993)., in which he played a prominent role until 1993. The bishops&#x27; synods were being reduced to rubber stamping the decisions of Rome, and neither the bishops&#x27; collegiality nor Vatican centralism could be discussed.

The result of this change was threefold:
* As Rome was perceived to turn to the right, Danneels, who considers himself an &quot;extreme centrist&quot;, was more and more perceived as a leftist or a liberal, in spite of himself.
* As Danneels gradually increased the distance between himself and Rome, his popularity at home increased and he became &quot;the&quot; face of the Catholic Church in Belgium, to the local issues of which he devoted more and more of his time.
* He also devoted more and more of his time to international tasks, which often involved his diplomatic abilities as well as his prestige.

After the 2013 conclave he again felt at ease in Rome, but by then he had already retired as archbishop.

===Danneels and the Belgian court===
As primate of Belgium, Danneels officiated at every great ceremony at the royal court.

Danneels&#x27; relations with the court were good, but not particularly close. He even denied having a close relationship with King Baudouin, whom he saw often and whom he greatly admired.

===Synods===
Danneels participated in a number of synods of bishops and played a prominent role in some of them, notably in:

====Special Assembly for the Netherlands (14–31 January 1980)====
Danneels chaired this synod, on &quot;The Pastoral Situation in the Netherlands&quot;, together with cardinal Johannes Willebrands. Its central task was to overcome the divisions that were plaguing the Catholic Church in the Netherlands and the widening gap between Rome and many Dutch Catholics. Its final document was signed by all participants, but it was poorly received in the Netherlands, and the conflicts between the Dutch bishops among themselves and between some of them and their flocks continued.

====Fifth Ordinary General Assembly (26 September – 25 October 1980)====
Its theme was &quot;The Christian Family&quot;. In a speech (&quot;My best synod speech ever&quot;) Danneels stressed the values that were the foundations of &quot;Humanae vitae&quot;, but called for objectively analyzing the reasons why so many Catholics refused its teachings, and pointed out that many divorced Catholics no longer saw how canon law could be reconciled with the demands of God&#x27;s mercy. Toward the end of the synod, on 24 October, his prestige was such that he was elected a member of the general secretariat of the bishops&#x27; synods with 124 votes, outpolling even Cardinals Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger (121 votes) and Basil Hume (110 votes).

====Second Extraordinary General Assembly (25 November – 8 December 1985)====
Devoted to &quot;The Twentieth Anniversary of the Conclusion of the Second Vatican Council&quot;, its discussions revolved around the question &quot;Shall we put the brakes on Vatican II, or shall we continue or even go beyond it?&quot; Danneels was appointed its &quot;General Relator&quot; (rapporteur), and in this task he was assisted by Walter Kasper, then still a theology professor. Their final report was praised by the Pope and accepted almost unanimously. But its conclusions could be, and were, interpreted in both directions, and it left many decisions up to Rome, thus putting no stop to the centralizing tendencies in the Church.

====Special Assembly for Europe (1–23 October 1999)====
Its theme was &quot;Jesus Christ, Alive in His Church, Source of Hope for Europe&quot;. Danneels&#x27; speech attacking the cultural pessimism prevalent among a number of Roman prelates impressed many council fathers as well as Pope John Paul II, who allowed him to go beyond the allotted time.

====Third Extraordinary General Assembly (5–19 October 2014)====
This was popularly known as the &quot;Synod on the Family&quot;; officially it was about &quot;Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelization&quot;. Danneels&#x27; intervention was brief, but his presence at the synod was notable, as it followed a personal invitation by Pope Francis.

===Danneels and liberation theology===
Danneels was aware of the risks of liberation theology and its political dimension. But when on 6 August 1984, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published &quot;Libertatis nuntius&quot;, its Instruction on Certain Aspects of the &quot;Theology of Liberation&quot; without even consulting him, though he was a member, he publicly denounced it in several interviews, for its procedure and, more importantly, for its overly intellectual approach of the concept of freedom, which failed to take seriously the pains caused by poverty and by political and military oppression. He was instrumental in preventing a condemnation of his friend Gustavo Gutiérrez, and he was pleased that the follow-up of &quot;Libertatis nuntius, Libertatis conscientia&quot;, the Congregation&#x27;s &quot;Instruction of Christian Freedom and Liberation&quot;, did not proclaim a definitive condemnation of liberation theology.

===Danneels and the Belgian constitutional crisis over abortion===
In March and April 1990, King Boudewijn&#x27;s refusal to sign the law liberalizing abortion, drafted by Roger Lallemand and by Lucienne Herman-Michielsens and approved by Parliament, provoked a constitutional crisis. Both Danneels and Prime Minister Wilfried Martens had foreseen the King&#x27;s refusal, and in the spring of 1989, Danneels had offered Martens to mediate in case of just such a crisis. Danneels had often discussed the moral dilemma the King faced, but denies mediating &quot;after&quot; the King&#x27;s decision was taken. The words of two Ministers of State, Philippe Moureaux and Mark Eyskens, have been interpreted as meaning that he did. But neither Moureaux [&quot;On évoquait une discrète et prudente intervention du cardinal&quot; (A discreet and prudent intervention of the cardinal was recalled)] nor Eyskens [&quot;Maar geen enkel resultaat&quot; (But no result whatsoever)] say this in so many words. They may just as well have alluded to the earlier talks between Danneels and the King.

In a number of reactions to the VTM broadcast it has been claimed that Danneels counseled the King to sign the Lallemand–Herman Michielsens law. However, whatever Danneels said in conversations with the King, before, during or after this constitutional crisis, he has always respected any &quot;colloque singulier&quot; he had with the King. Since King Boudewijn is dead, Danneels took the secret of what he told the King to his grave. The claim that he advised the King to sign is pure speculation.

Danneels flatly denied he did: &quot;Ik heb alvast nooit geprobeerd hem om te praten&quot; (I certainly never tried to talk him [the King] round). Shortly after the law was published in the Belgian official journal, the Belgian bishops, including Danneels, issued a declaration in which they distinguished what is legally acceptable and what is morally desirable, and they unambiguously rejected the law morally. Danneels has never wavered from the conviction that &quot;a society that encourages abortion of those that are born in the margins of society or that do not have the chance to be loved abandons its humanizing role and ultimately condemns itself&quot;.

===Member of the group of Sankt Gallen===
On 3 January 1999, Danneels became a member of St. Gallen Group, in which he was to play a prominent role.

===Danneels&#x27; view on homosexuality and same-sex marriage===
Danneels always objected to discrimination against homosexuals and he was always in favor of a juridical statute for stable relations between partners of the same sex. He said as much on 11 April 2003 in a private letter to Guy Verhofstadt, whose government had approved this. But he has always been opposed to calling such a statute &quot;marriage&quot;. He repeated these views ten years later, in a newspaper interview in which he said:
===Danneels&#x27; view on euthanasia===
Long before Belgium liberalized its law on euthanasia, in a press conference on 31 January 1994, Danneels gave voice to the Belgian bishops&#x27; opposition to the idea.
The issue resurfaced again, with a vengeance, in the spring of 2008, when famous Belgian author Hugo Claus chose euthanasia on 19 March and when three days later Danneels devoted his homily during the Easter Vigil to &quot;the problem of suffering and death&quot;, without, however, mentioning Claus by name. Even so, this homily was widely interpreted as criticism of Claus&#x27; choice and heavily criticized. But shortly afterwards, on 13 April 2008, Danneels doubled down in &quot;Het Braambos&quot;, a broadcast of the &quot;Katholieke Televisie- en Radio-Omroep&quot; (Catholic Television and Radio Broadcasting Organization):
===Ecumenical activities===
From the beginning of his archbishopric, Danneels kept cultivating the good contacts between &quot;Mechelen&quot; and Anglicanism that were started by Cardinal Mercier in the 1920s.

Likewise from the beginning of his archbishopric, Danneels made almost yearly visits to the Taizé Community. He mediated with the Vatican to make Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Taizé on 5 October 1986 happen. He regularly met with Brother Roger, on whom the Catholic University bestowed an honorary doctorate in 1990. But after Brother Roger&#x27;s death, too, he kept fostering relations with Taizé, and from 29 December 2008 through 2 January 200 he hosted the 31st European Taizé meeting in Brussels.

Danneels was a member of the World Council of Religions for Peace, on which he sat until 2004. Starting in the summer of 2002, he was also active in one of its projects, the European Council of Religious Leaders, in which he remained involved through the first decade of the 21st century.

===Diplomatic activities===
Danneels was involved in the negotiations about the convent of the Carmelite nuns at Auschwitz after father Werenfried van Straaten had proposed, in 1985, to convert its temporary location in the former theater building into a full-fledged convent. Danneels involvement lasted until 1989, when Rome decided the issue and promised the nuns would move out. (But they remained until 1993, and left behind the Auschwitz cross.)

Between 1990 and 1999, Danneels was the international president of &quot;Pax Christi&quot;.

Danneels was a consistent and strong supporter of bishop (later cardinal) Monsengwo&#x27;s attempts to foster democracy in Zaire, mediating between Belgium, Rome and Kinshasa. He was instrumental in Monsengwo&#x27;s being awarded an honorary doctorate by the Catholic University of Leuven on 2 February 1993 and he gave the Laudatio himself.

Danneels worked long and hard to thaw the relations between China and the Catholic Church. In November 1985 he invited a delegation of official Chinese bishops, who had been invited to Leuven by the Catholic University, to lunch in his residence in Mechelen. A return invitation followed, but problems caused by the coexistence of the official and the underground Catholic Church in China led to Danneels having to postpone his visit. When it finally happened, in March 2005, Danneels had to cut it short, owing to the death of pope John Paul II on 2 April. But on 3 April the Chinese government issued a communiqué lauding Pope John Paul&#x27;s efforts to recognize the Church&#x27;s errors. Pope Benedict encouraged Danneels to continue his efforts and in March 2008 Danneels again went to China, where he addressed the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and where he was allowed to encounter a number of rural Catholic communities.

===Dealing with child sex abuse in the Belgian Church===
Danneels was first confronted with the problem of sexual abuse in the Church in the aftermath of the Dutroux affair, when the authorities&#x27; call for victims of abuse to come forward revealed that there had also been cases of abuse in the Church. (But see also the Vangheluwe affair, below.)

The first to formally organize a contact point for victims of sexual abuse within the Belgian Church was Arthur Luysterman, the bishop of Ghent. That contact point was the model of the &quot;Commission for Complaints about Sexual Abuse in Pastoral Relations&quot;, which the conference of the Belgian bishops (chaired by Danneels) organized on 4 November 1999.

Early in 1998 it became known that a priest of the archdiocese had raped a minor in 1968. Danneels volunteered to testify in court, the first time ever that a cardinal had appeared before a secular court in Belgium. Danneels said that he had known nothing about the abuse. The court held that the Catholic Church in Belgium—not the archbishop himself nor his auxiliary bishop—was guilty of failing to protect the victim, was civilly responsible, and imposed a fine of half a million Belgian francs (now ± €12,500 ). On appeal this verdict was quashed and only the abusive priest was held guilty.

On 6 December 1999 the authorities began proceedings against Robert Borremans; a priest of the archdiocese, well known because he had been the choral conductor at the marriage of Philippe and Mathilde (now King and Queen). Danneels relieved him of his pastoral tasks and had him struck from the government&#x27;s payroll. Though convicted at first, Borremans was cleared in the end, when the allegations against him were found to be false.

====Vangheluwe affair and its aftermath====
From 1973 to 1986, Roger Vangheluwe, a priest since 1963 and the Bishop of Bruges since early 1985, sexually abused a nephew of his. Rik Devillé, a priest who had had a couple of conflicts with Danneels, said, after the scandal broke on 23 April 2010, that he had warned Danneels about Vangheluwe in the mid-1990s. In 2010, Danneels said that he did not remember this. But Danneels certainly knew about Vangheluwe&#x27;s crime before the scandal broke because, in the beginning of April 2010, Vangheluwe had himself told Danneels that he had had a sexual contact with a minor. What Danneels did, or did not do, in the few weeks before the scandal broke, earned him a great deal of criticism, both at home and abroad. On 8 April, Vangheluwe pressured Danneels to accept a meeting with himself, his victim and the victim&#x27;s relatives. At that meeting Danneels advised the victim to delay a public statement until Vangheluwe had retired. Speaking through a spokesman, Toon Osaer, Danneels explained that he had been unprepared for this meeting and that his proposal that the victim remain silent was &quot;an improvisation&quot;. Danneels did not reveal this conversation to the Belgian bishops. At another meeting Vangheluwe, in Danneels&#x27; presence, made a private apology which the victim rejected. In the night of Monday 19 to Tuesday 20 April all Belgian bishops received an e-mail exposing Vangheluwe. This resulted in Vangheluwe&#x27;s resignation on 22 April and its immediate acceptance by the Vatican on 23 April, as was revealed on the same date by Danneels&#x27; successor as archbishop, André-Mutien Léonard, at a press conference. In a press communiqué, likewise on 23 April, Vangheluwe publicly admitted his guilt and publicly apologized.

In the weeks after Vangheluwe&#x27;s resignation, the &quot;Commission for Complaints about Sexual Abuse in Pastoral Relations&quot; (now often called the Adriaenssens Commission, after its chairman, child psychiatrist Peter Adriaenssens) received no fewer than 475 complaints about sexual abuse. On 24 June, in an operation code named &quot;Kelk&quot; (&quot;Chalice&quot;) organized at the request of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the archiepiscopal palace, Danneels&#x27; private apartment, the Leuven seat of the Adriaenssens Commission and even St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral (where the graves of Cardinal Mercier and Cardinal Suenens were broken into) were simultaneously searched for documents about cases of sexual abuse that could still be prosecuted (unlike that of Vangheluwe, beyond the statute of limitation). On 6 July, Danneels was subjected to an all-day interrogation by the Brussels branch of the Judicial Police. Later the search was judged to have been illegal and all documents seized were returned. Great damage to Danneels&#x27;s reputation was caused by the publication in &quot;De Standaard&quot; and &quot;Het Nieuwsblad&quot; on 28 August 2010 of the transcript of tape recordings, made secretly, of the two meetings Danneels had had with the victim and his family. The transcripts revealed that the victim felt that he was not being understood and considered Danneels&#x27; manner to be inept.

For Danneels, the final chapter of the affair was his appearance, on 21 December 2010, before a parliamentary committee investigating sexual abuse in hierarchical relations. He emphatically stated that there had never been a policy of covering up or denying, let alone tolerating sexual abuse, that justice had to be done and that the Church must cooperate.

But even if that is accepted, Danneels was widely reproached for inaction in a matter in which the public expected him to be decisive. As an editorial in &quot;De Standaard&quot; of 1 September 2010 put it: &quot;For days he kept the shock of Vangheluwe&#x27;s confession to himself. He did not contact the ex-bishop again to convince him of what was inevitable: his immediate resignation. He did not refer the matter to the Adriaenssens Commission. And he did not involve his own successor, archbishop Léonard.&quot;

==Papal conclave of 2005==
Upon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Danneels was listed as a possible successor (or &quot;papabile)&quot; although with weakened credentials due to the fact that he was an archbishop of a country where abortion, euthanasia and same-sex unions had recently been legalized and where, under his watch, church attendance and pastoral vocations have dropped to historical lows.

Danneels participated in the 2005 papal conclave. The pre-conclave discussions pointed out the direction which the conclave was to take. It elected Pope Benedict XVI. In a TV interview directly after this election, which he had promised—&quot;foolishly&quot;, he said, because keeping this promise prevented him from attending the dinner with the pope and the other cardinals, and because he was tired—his body language indicated he was not enthusiastic, which was widely interpreted as indicating he was an opponent of the new pope. Danneels denies this: &quot;That is not true, but I&#x27;ll have to bear that charge until I die.&quot;

==Retirement and succession==
On 4 June 2008, Danneels reached the mandatory age of retirement; his succession took time and did not go smoothly. The three names on the &quot;terna&quot; (list of three) of possible successors Karl-Josef Rauber, the papal nuncio, sent to Rome, were rejected, and so were the names on a second terna Rauber sent. It was not until 18 January 2010 that Rome imposed its own candidate and replaced Danneels as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels by André-Mutien Léonard, whom Rauber openly said &quot;non era &#x27;del tutto adatto&#x27; per Bruxelles&quot; (was not totally suitable for Brussels).

==Papal conclave of 2013==
Danneels was not considered &quot;papabile&quot; before the 2013 conclave, in which he participated. Naturally he also participated in the cardinals&#x27; pre-conclave discussions, which he called &quot;the most interesting discussions in all my life as cardinal&quot;, as they were far more open than those preceding the 2005 conclave, and as their main theme was the need for collegiality.

The conclave elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio (whom Danneels, as a member of the St. Gallen Group, supported). The newly elected pope Francis invited Danneels to appear with him on the balcony when he first appeared after the Habemus Papam.

At Pope Francis&#x27; inauguration, Danneels pronounced the formal prayer for the new pope in the absence of the protopriest, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns. He later described the result of this conclave as &quot;een persoonlijke verrijzeniservaring&quot; (a personal resurrection experience).

==Death==
Danneels died on 14 March 2019 in Mechelen. His funeral services, with the King, Queen, other members of the royal family and numerous politicians attending, were held on 22 March 2019 in St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral in Mechelen, where he was buried in the crypt of the cathedral.

==Honors==
* Danneels was awarded honorary doctorates by the Catholic University of Tilburg (2 September 2002) and by Georgetown University (3 March 2003).
* On 20 December 2003 Danneels won the &quot;Castar&quot;, an award bestowed by CAnvas, &quot;De STAndaard&quot; and Radio 1 on &quot;the man or the woman whose cultural, social, political or socio-economic contributions have been positive and remarkable.&quot;
* Danneels was ranked #90 in Les plus grands Belges (2005).
* To celebrate his 75th birthday, the Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Leuven organized a symposium in his honor.
* On 18 June 2010 he was made an honorary citizen of Mechelen.

==Miscellaneous==
* His mother tongue was Dutch (both Standard Dutch and the Kanegem dialect, barely mutually comprehensible), and he also spoke English, French, German and Italian fluently, as well as Latin (at least during his studies in Rome).
* In addition to a minor dip toward the end of 1959, Danneels twice had serious health problems. In the spring of 1971, he suffered a depression, resulting from overworking himself in combination with failing to rest and recuperate from eye surgery. A prolonged period of rest in Kanegem, imposed by his bishop, put him back on his feet. On 4 March 1996, a routine medical check-up revealed life-threatening stenosis of the blood vessels around his heart and he underwent bypass surgery the same day.
* His Marian devotion was very strong. He even insisted on attending the Marian Hanswijk procession in May 1996, though still recovering from his surgery on 4 March.
* He was an ardent lover of art, in all its forms, and his taste is eclectic. In music, for example, he appreciated &quot;the three Bs, Bach, Beethoven and the Beatles&quot;.

<doc id="1142431" wikidata="Q162881" url="?curid=1142431" title="African-American history">
<text>African-American history started with the forced transportation of Africans to North America in the 16th and 17th centuries. The European colonization of the Americas, and the resulting Atlantic slave trade, encompassed a large-scale transportation of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Of the roughly 10–12 million Africans who were sold in the Barbary slave trade, either to Europe or the Americas, approximately 388,000 were sent to North America. After arriving in various European colonies in North America, the enslaved Africans were sold to white colonists, primarily to work on cash crop plantations. A group of enslaved Africans arrived in the English Virginia Colony in 1619, marking the beginning of slavery in the colonial history of the United States; by 1776, roughly 20% of the British North American population was of African descent, both free and enslaved.

During the American Revolutionary War, in which the Thirteen Colonies gained independence and began to form the United States, Black soldiers fought on both the British and the American sides. After after the conflict ended, the Northern United States gradually abolished slavery. However, the population of the American South, which had an economy dependent on plantations operation by slave labor, increased their usage of Africans as slaves during the westward expansion of the United States. During this period, numerous enslaved African Americans escaped into free states and Canada via the Underground Railroad. Disputes over slavery between the Northern and Southern states led to the American Civil War, in which 178,000 African Americans served on the Union side. During the war, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery in the U.S., except as punishment for a crime.

After the war ended with a Confederate defeat, the Reconstruction era began, in which African Americans living in the South were granted limited rights compared to their white counterparts. White opposition to these advancements led to most African Americans living in the South to be disfranchised, and a system of racial segregation known as the Jim Crow laws was passed in the Southern states. Beginning in the early 20th century, in response to poor economic conditions, segregation and lynchings, over 6 million African Americans, primarily rural, were forced to migrate out of the South to other regions of the United States in search of opportunity. The nadir of American race relations led to civil rights efforts to overturn discrimination and racism against African Americans. In 1954, these efforts coalesced into a broad unified movement led by civil rights activists such as Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. This succeeded in persuading the federal government to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial discrimination.

The 2020 United States census reported that 46,936,733 respondents identified as African Americans, forming roughly 14.2% of the American population. Of those, over 2.1 million immigrated to the United States as citizens of modern African states. African Americans have made major contributions to the culture of the United States, including literature, cinema and music.

==Enslavement==

===African origins===
African Americans are the descendants of Africans who were forced into slavery and sold after they were captured by other tribes during African wars or raids, and were brought to America by Europeans as part of the Atlantic slave trade. African Americans are descended from various ethnic groups, mostly from ethnic groups that lived in West and Central Africa, including the Sahel. A smaller number of African Americans are descended from ethnic groups that lived in Eastern and Southeastern Africa. The major ethnic groups that the enslaved Africans belonged to included the Bakongo, Igbo, Mandinka, Wolof, Akan, Fon, Yoruba, and Makua, among many others. Although these different groups varied in customs, religious theology, and language, what they had in common was a way of life which was different from that of the Europeans. Once they were enslaved and sent to the Americas, these different peoples had European standards and beliefs forced upon them, causing them to do away with tribal differences and forge a new common culture that was a creolization of their original cultures and European cultures. People who belonged to specific African ethnic groups were more sought after and became more dominant in numbers than people who belonged to other African ethnic groups in certain regions of the land that is now the United States.

====Regions of Africa====
Studies of contemporary documents reveal seven regions from which Africans were sold or taken during the Atlantic slave trade. These regions were:
* Senegambia (present-day Senegal and The Gambia) encompassing the coast from the Senegal River to the Casamance River, where captives as far away as the Upper and Middle Niger River Valley were sold;
* The Sierra Leone region included territory from the Casamance to the Assinie in the modern countries of Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire;
* The Gold Coast region consisted of mainly modern Ghana;
* The Bight of Benin region stretched from the Volta River to the Benue River in modern Togo, Benin, and southwestern Nigeria;
* The Bight of Biafra extended from southeastern Nigeria through Cameroon into Gabon;
* West Central Africa, the largest region, included the Congo and Angola; and
* East and Southeast Africa, the region of Mozambique-Madagascar included the modern countries of Mozambique, parts of Tanzania, and Madagascar.

The largest origin of Africans transported as slaves across the Atlantic Ocean for the New World was West Africa. Some West Africans were skilled iron workers and were therefore able to make tools that aided in their agricultural labor. While there were many unique tribes with their own customs and religions, by the 15th century many of the tribes had embraced Islam. Those villages in West Africa which were lucky enough to be in good conditions for growth and success, prospered. They also contributed their success to the slave trade for their own benefit.

In all, about 10–12 million Africans were transported to the Western Hemisphere. The vast majority of these people came from that stretch of the West African coast extending from present-day Senegal to Angola; a small percentage came from Madagascar and East Africa. Only 5% (about 500,000) went to the American colonies. The vast majority went to the West Indies and Brazil, where they died quickly. Demographic conditions were highly favorable in the American colonies, with less disease, more food, some medical care, and lighter work loads than prevailed in the sugar fields.

Origins and percentages of African Americans imported to the Thirteen Colonies, New France, and New Spain (1700–1820):
===Transport===
In the account of Olaudah Equiano, he described the process of being transported to the colonies and being on the slave ships as a horrific experience. On the ships, the enslaved Africans were separated from their family long before they boarded the ships. Once aboard the ships the captives were then segregated by gender. Under the deck, the enslaved Africans were cramped and did not have enough space to walk around freely. Enslaved males were generally kept in the ship&#x27;s hold, where they experienced the worst of crowding. The captives stationed on the floor beneath low-lying bunks could barely move and spent much of the voyage pinned to the floorboards, which could, over time, wear the skin on their elbows down to the bone. Due to the lack of basic hygiene, malnourishment, and dehydration diseases spread wildly and death was common.

The women on the ships were often raped by the crewmen. Women and children were often kept in rooms set apart from the main hold to give crewmen access to the women. However, these rooms also gave enslaved women better access to information on the ship&#x27;s crew, fortifications, and daily routine, but little opportunity to communicate this to the men confined in the ship&#x27;s hold. Women instigated, among other attempts at mutiny, a 1797 insurrection aboard the slave ship &quot;Thomas&quot; by stealing weapons and passing them to the men below as well as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the ship&#x27;s crew. Enslaved males were the most likely candidates to mutiny but were only able to at times they were on deck. While rebellions did not happen often, they were usually unsuccessful. In order for the crew members to keep the enslaved Africans under control and prevent future rebellions, the crews were often twice as large and members would instill fear into the enslaved Africans through brutality and harsh punishments. It took about six months from the time of capture for enslaved Africans to arrive on the plantations of their European masters. Africans were completely cut off from their families, home, and community life and were forced to adjust to a new way of life.

==Colonial era==


Some Africans assisted the Spanish and the Portuguese during their early exploration and conquest of the Americas. In the 16th century some Black explorers settled in the Mississippi valley and in the areas that became South Carolina and New Mexico. The most celebrated Black explorer of the Americas was Estéban, who traveled through the Southwest in the 1530s.

In 1619, the first captive Africans, kidnapped by Portuguese slave traders, were brought and sold via a Dutch slave ship in Point Comfort (today Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia), thirty miles downstream from Jamestown, Virginia. Colonizers in Virginia treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually abandoned in favor of the system of chattel slavery used in the Caribbean because the colonizers realized when servants were freed, they became competition for resources. Additionally, releasing servants led to Europeans desiring to replace them, which was additional labor. This, combined with the ambiguous nature of the social status of African people and the difficulty in using any other group of people as forced servants, led to the choice of subjugating African people into slavery. Massachusetts was the first colony to legalize slavery in 1641. Other colonies followed suit by passing laws that made slave status heritable and made non-Christian imported servants slaves for life.

By 1700, there were 25,000 enslaved Black people in the North American mainland colonies, forming roughly 10% of the population. Some enslaved Black people had been directly transported from Africa (most of them were from 1518 to the 1850s), but initially, in the very early stages of the European colonization of North America, occasionally they had been transported via the West Indies in small groups after being forced to work under harsh conditions on the islands. Concurrently, many were born to enslaved Africans and their descendants, and thus were native-born on the North American mainland. Their legal status was codified into law with the Virginia Statutes: ACT XII of 1662, proclaiming all children upon birth would inherit the same status of enslavement as their mother.

As European colonists engaged in aggressive expansionism, claiming and clearing more land— via the displacement of Native Americans— for large-scale farming. Plantations were constructed, and in the 1660s enslavement and transport of Africans rapidly increased. The slave trade from the West Indies proved insufficient to meet demand in the now fast-growing North American slave market. Additionally, most North American buyers of enslaved people no longer wanted to purchase enslaved people who had already endured slavery in the West Indies—by now they were either harder to obtain, too expensive, undesirable, or more often, they had been exhausted in many ways by the brutality of the islands&#x27; sugar plantations. From the 1680s onward, the majority of enslaved Africans imported into North America were directly from Africa, and most of them were sent to ports located in what is now the Southern U.S., particularly in the present-day states of Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana.

===Black population in the 18th century===
The population of enslaved African Americans in North America grew rapidly during the 18th and early 19th centuries due to a variety of factors, including a lower prevalence of tropic diseases and rape of black women by white men. Colonial society was divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, though it remained legal in each of the Thirteen Colonies until the American Revolution. Slavery led to a gradual shift between the American South and North, both before and after independence, as the comparatively more urbanized and industrialized North required fewer slaves than the South.

By the 1750s, the native-born enslaved population of African descent outnumbered that of the African-born enslaved. By the time of the American Revolution, several Northern states were considering the abolition of slavery. However some Southern colonies, such as Virginia, had produced such large and self-sustaining native-born enslaved Black populations that they stopped taking indirect imports of enslaved Africans altogether. Other colonies such as Georgia and South Carolina still relied on steady enslavement of people to keep up with the ever-growing demand for agricultural labor among the burgeoning plantation economies. These colonies continued to import enslaved Africans until the trade was outlawed in 1808, save for a temporary lull during the Revolutionary War.

South Carolina&#x27;s Black population remained very high for most of the eighteenth century due to the continued import of enslaved Africans, with Blacks outnumbering whites three-to-one. In contrast, Virginia had a consistent white majority despite its significant Black enslaved population. It was said that in the eighteenth century, the colony South Carolina resembled an &quot;extension of West Africa&quot;.

==American Revolution and early United States==
The latter half of the 18th century was a time of significant political upheaval on the North American continent. In the midst of cries for independence from British rule, many pointed out the hypocrisy inherent in colonial slaveholders&#x27; demands for freedom. The Declaration of Independence, a document which would become a manifesto for human rights and personal freedom around the world, was written by Thomas Jefferson, a man who owned over 200 enslaved people. Other Southern statesmen were also major slaveholders. The Second Continental Congress considered freeing enslaved people to assist with the war effort, but they also removed language from the Declaration of Independence that included the promotion of slavery amongst the offenses of King George III. A number of free Black people, most notably Prince Hall—founder of Prince Hall Freemasonry—submitted petitions which called for abolition, but these were largely ignored.

This did not deter Black people, free and enslaved, from participating in the Revolution. Crispus Attucks, a free Black tradesman, was the first casualty of the Boston Massacre and of the ensuing American Revolutionary War. 5,000 Black people, including Prince Hall, fought in the Continental Army. Many fought side by side with White soldiers at the battles of Lexington and Concord and at Bunker Hill. However, upon George Washington&#x27;s ascension to commander of the Continental Army in 1775, the additional recruitment of Black people was forbidden.

Approximately 5,000 free African-American men helped the American Colonists in their struggle for freedom. One of these men, Agrippa Hull, fought in the American Revolution for over six years. He and the other African-American soldiers fought in order to improve their white neighbor&#x27;s views of them and advance their own fight of freedom.

By contrast, the British and Loyalists offered emancipation to any enslaved person owned by a Patriot who was willing to join the Loyalist forces. Lord Dunmore, the Governor of Virginia, recruited 300 African-American men into his Ethiopian regiment within a month of making this proclamation. In South Carolina 25,000 enslaved people, more than one-quarter of the total, escaped to join and fight with the British, or fled for freedom in the uproar of war. Thousands of enslaved people also escaped in Georgia and Virginia, as well as New England and New York. Well-known African Americans who fought for the British include Colonel Tye and Boston King.

Thomas Peters was one of the large numbers of African Americans who fought for the British. Peters was born in present-day Nigeria and belonged to the Yoruba tribe, and ended up being captured and sold into slavery in French Louisiana. Sold again, he was enslaved in North Carolina and escaped his master&#x27;s farm in order to receive Lord Dunmore&#x27;s promise of freedom. Peters had fought for the British throughout the war. When the war finally ended, he and other African Americans who fought on the losing side were taken to Nova Scotia. Here, they encountered difficulty farming the small plots of lands they were granted. They also did not receive the same privileges and opportunities as the white Loyalists had. Peters sailed to London in order to complain to the government. &quot;He arrived at a momentous time when English abolitionists were pushing a bill through Parliament to charter the Sierra Leone Company and to grant it trading and settlement rights on the West African coast.&quot; Peters and the other African Americans on Nova Scotia left for Sierra Leone in 1792. Peters died soon after they arrived, but the other members of his party lived on in their new home where they formed the Sierra Leone Creole ethnic identity.

===American independence===
The colonists eventually won the war and the United States was recognized as a sovereign nation. In the provisional treaty, they demanded the return of property, including enslaved people. Nonetheless, the British helped up to 3,000 documented African Americans to leave the country for Nova Scotia, Jamaica and Britain rather than be returned to slavery.

The Constitutional Convention of 1787 sought to define the foundation for the government of the newly formed United States of America. The constitution set forth the ideals of freedom and equality while providing for the continuation of the institution of slavery through the fugitive slave clause and the three-fifths compromise. Additionally, free Black people&#x27;s rights were also restricted in many places. Most were denied the right to vote and were excluded from public schools. Some Black people sought to fight these contradictions in court. In 1780, Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker used language from the new Massachusetts constitution that declared all men were born free and equal in freedom suits to gain release from slavery. A free Black businessman in Boston named Paul Cuffe sought to be excused from paying taxes since he had no voting rights.

In the Northern states, the revolutionary spirit did help African Americans. Beginning in the 1750s, there was widespread sentiment during the American Revolution that slavery was a social evil (for the country as a whole and for the whites) that should eventually be abolished. All the Northern states passed emancipation acts between 1780 and 1804; most of these arranged for gradual emancipation and a special status for freedmen, so there were still a dozen &quot;permanent apprentices&quot; into the 19th century. In 1787 Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance and barred slavery from the large Northwest Territory. In 1790, there were more than 59,000 free Black people in the United States. By 1810, that number had risen to 186,446. Most of these were in the North, but Revolutionary sentiments also motivated Southern slaveholders.

For 20 years after the Revolution, more Southerners also freed enslaved people, sometimes by manumission or in wills to be accomplished after the slaveholder&#x27;s death. In the Upper South, the percentage of free Black people rose from about 1% before the Revolution to more than 10% by 1810. Quakers and Moravians worked to persuade slaveholders to free families. In Virginia, the number of free Black people increased from 10,000 in 1790 to nearly 30,000 in 1810, but 95% of Black people were still enslaved. In Delaware, three-quarters of all Black people were free by 1810. By 1860, just over 91% of Delaware&#x27;s Black people were free, and 49.1% of those in Maryland.

Among the successful free men was Benjamin Banneker, a Maryland astronomer, mathematician, almanac author, surveyor, and farmer, who in 1791 assisted in the initial survey of the boundaries of the future District of Columbia. Despite the challenges of living in the new country, most free Black people fared far better than the nearly 800,000 enslaved Blacks. Even so, many considered emigrating to Africa.

==Antebellum period==

As the United States grew, the institution of slavery became more entrenched in the southern states, while northern states began to abolish it. Pennsylvania was the first, in 1780 passing an act for gradual abolition.

A number of events continued to shape views on slavery. One of these events was the Haitian Revolution, which was the only slave revolt that led to an independent country. Many slave owners fled to the United States with tales of horror and massacre that alarmed Southern whites.

The invention of the cotton gin in the 1790s allowed the cultivation of short staple cotton, which could be grown in much of the Deep South, where warm weather and proper soil conditions prevailed. The industrial revolution in Europe and New England generated a heavy demand for cotton for cheap clothing, which caused an enormous demand for slave labor to develop new cotton plantations. There was a 70% increase in the number of enslaved people in the United States in only 20 years. They were overwhelmingly concentrated on plantations in the Deep South, and moved west as old cotton fields lost their productivity and new lands were purchased. Unlike the Northern States who put more focus into manufacturing and commerce, the South was heavily dependent on agriculture. Southern political economists at this time supported the institution by concluding that nothing was inherently contradictory about owning people and that a future of slavery existed even if the South were to industrialize. Racial, economic, and political turmoil reached an all-time high regarding slavery up to the events of the Civil War.

In 1807, at the urging of President Thomas Jefferson, Congress abolished the importation of enslaved workers. While American Black people celebrated this as a victory in the fight against slavery, the ban increased the internal trade of enslaved people. Changing agricultural practices in the Upper South from tobacco to mixed farming decreased labor requirements, and enslaved people were sold to traders for the developing Deep South. In addition, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 allowed any Black person to be claimed as a runaway unless a White person testified on their behalf. A number of free Black people, especially indentured children, were kidnapped and sold into slavery with little or no hope of rescue. By 1819 there were exactly 11 free and 11 slave states, which increased sectionalism. Fears of an imbalance in Congress led to the 1820 Missouri Compromise that required states to be admitted to the union in pairs, one slave and one free.

In 1831, a rebellion occurred under the leadership of Nat Turner, that lasted four days. During the rebellion, which had been the most deadly in the United States, 55 white people were killed, while 120 black people, most unaffiliated with the rebellion, were killed in a retaliation by soldiers aided by local residents angry at the killings. This led to a fear larger scale rebellions would occur.

In 1850, after winning the Mexican–American War, a problem gripped the nation: what to do about the territories won from Mexico. Henry Clay, the man behind the compromise of 1820, once more rose to the challenge, to craft the compromise of 1850. In this compromise the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada would be organized but the issue of slavery would be decided later. Washington D.C. would abolish the slave trade but not slavery itself. California would be admitted as a free state but the South would receive a new fugitive slave act which required Northerners to return enslaved people who escaped to the North to their owners. The compromise of 1850 would maintain a shaky peace until the election of Lincoln in 1860.

In 1851 the battle between enslaved people and slave owners was met in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Christiana Riot demonstrated the growing conflict between states&#x27; rights and Congress on the issue of slavery.

===Abolitionism===

Abolitionists in Britain and the United States in the 1840–1860 period developed large, complex campaigns against slavery.

According to Patrick C. Kennicott, the largest and most effective abolitionist speakers were Black people who spoke before the countless local meetings of the National Negro Conventions. They used the traditional arguments against slavery, protesting it on moral, economic, and political grounds. Their role in the antislavery movement not only aided the abolitionist cause but also was a source of pride to the Black community.

In 1852, Harriet Beecher Stowe published a novel that changed how many would view slavery. &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; tells the story of the life of an enslaved person and the brutality that is faced by that life day after day. It would sell over 100,000 copies in its first year. The popularity of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; would solidify the North in its opposition to slavery, and press forward the abolitionist movement. President Lincoln would later invite Stowe to the White House in honor of this book that changed America.

In 1856 Charles Sumner, a Massachusetts congressmen and antislavery leader, was assaulted and nearly killed on the House floor by Preston Brooks of South Carolina. Sumner had been delivering an abolitionist speech to Congress when Brooks attacked him. Brooks received praise in the South for his actions while Sumner became a political icon in the North. Sumner later returned to the Senate, where he was a leader of the Radical Republicans in ending slavery and legislating equal rights for freed slaves.

Over 1 million enslaved people were moved from the older seaboard slave states, with their declining economies, to the rich cotton states of the southwest; many others were sold and moved locally. Ira Berlin (2000) argues that this Second Middle Passage shredded the planters&#x27; paternalist pretenses in the eyes of Black people and prodded enslaved people and free Black people to create a host of oppositional ideologies and institutions that better accounted for the realities of endless deportations, expulsions, and flights that continually remade their world. Benjamin Quarles&#x27; work &quot;Black Abolitionists&quot; provides the most extensive account of the role of Black abolitionists in the American anti-slavery movement.

===The Black community===
 Black people generally settled in cities, creating the core of Black community life in the region. They established churches and fraternal orders. Many of these early efforts were weak and they often failed, but they represented the initial steps in the evolution of Black communities.

During the early Antebellum period, the creation of free Black communities began to expand, laying out a foundation for African Americans&#x27; future. At first, only a few thousand African Americans had their freedom. As the years went by, the number of Blacks being freed expanded tremendously, building to 233,000 by the 1820s. They sometimes sued to gain their freedom or purchased it. Some slave owners freed their bondspeople and a few state legislatures abolished slavery.

African Americans tried to take the advantage of establishing homes and jobs in the cities. During the early 1800s free Black people took several steps to establish fulfilling work lives in urban areas. The rise of industrialization, which depended on power-driven machinery more than human labor, might have afforded them employment, but many owners of textile mills refused to hire Black workers. These owners considered whites to be more reliable and educable. This resulted in many Black people performing unskilled labor. Black men worked as stevedores, construction worker, and as cellar-, well- and grave-diggers. As for Black women workers, they worked as servants for white families. Some women were also cooks, seamstresses, basket-makers, midwives, teachers, and nurses. Black women worked as washerwomen or domestic servants for the white families. Some cities had independent Black seamstresses, cooks, basketmakers, confectioners, and more.

While the African Americans left the thought of slavery behind, they made a priority to reunite with their family and friends. The cause of the Revolutionary War forced many Black people to migrate to the west afterwards, and the scourge of poverty created much difficulty with housing. African Americans competed with the Irish and Germans in jobs and had to share space with them.

While the majority of free Black people lived in poverty, some were able to establish successful businesses that catered to the Black community. Racial discrimination often meant that Black people were not welcome or would be mistreated in White businesses and other establishments. To counter this, Black people like James Forten developed their own communities with Black-owned businesses. Black doctors, lawyers, and other businessmen were the foundation of the Black middle class.

Many Black people organized to help strengthen the Black community and continue the fight against slavery. One of these organizations was the American Society of Free Persons of Colour, founded in 1830. This organization provided social aid to poor Black people and organized responses to political issues. Further supporting the growth of the Black Community was the Black church, usually the first community institution to be established. Starting in the early 1800s with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and other churches, the Black church grew to be the focal point of the Black community. The Black church was both an expression of community and unique African-American spirituality, and a reaction to European American discrimination. The church also served as neighborhood centers where free Black people could celebrate their African heritage without intrusion by white detractors. The church was the center of the Black communities, but it was also the center of education. Since the church was part of the community and wanted to provide education; they educated the freed and enslaved Black people. At first, Black preachers formed separate congregations within the existing denominations, such as social clubs or literary societies. Because of discrimination at the higher levels of the church hierarchy, some Black people like Richard Allen (bishop) simply founded separate Black denominations.

Free Black people also established Black churches in the South before 1800. After the Great Awakening, many Black people joined the Baptist Church, which allowed for their participation, including roles as elders and preachers. For instance, First Baptist Church and Gillfield Baptist Church of Petersburg, Virginia, both had organized congregations by 1800 and were the first Baptist churches in the city. Petersburg, an industrial city, by 1860 had 3,224 free Black people (36% of Black people, and about 26% of all free persons), the largest population in the South. In Virginia, free Black people also created communities in Richmond, Virginia and other towns, where they could work as artisans and create businesses. Others were able to buy land and farm in frontier areas further from white control.

The Black community also established schools for Black children, since they were often banned from entering public schools. Richard Allen organized the first Black Sunday school in America; it was established in Philadelphia during 1795. Then five years later, the priest Absalom Jones established a school for Black youth. Black Americans regarded education as the surest path to economic success, moral improvement and personal happiness. Only the sons and daughters of the Black middle class had the luxury of studying.

===Haiti&#x27;s effect on slavery===
The revolt of enslaved Haitians against their white slave owners, which began in 1791 and lasted until 1801, was a primary source of fuel for both enslaved people and abolitionists arguing for the freedom of Africans in the U.S. In the 1833 edition of &quot;Nile&#x27;s Weekly Register&quot; it is stated that freed Black people in Haiti were better off than their Jamaican counterparts, and the positive effects of American Emancipation are alluded to throughout the paper. These anti-slavery sentiments were popular among both white abolitionists and African-American slaves. Enslaved people rallied around these ideas with rebellions against their masters as well as white bystanders during the Denmark Vesey Conspiracy of 1822 and the Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion of 1831. Leaders and plantation owners were also very concerned about the consequences Haiti&#x27;s revolution would have on early America. Thomas Jefferson, for one, was wary of the &quot;instability of the West Indies&quot;, referring to Haiti.

===&quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;===

Dred Scott was an enslaved man whose owner had taken him to live in the free state of Illinois. After his owner&#x27;s death, Dred Scott sued in court for his freedom on the basis of his having lived in a free state for a long period. The Black community received an enormous shock with the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision in March 1857. Black people were not American citizens and could never be citizens, the court said in a decision roundly denounced by the Republican Party as well as the abolitionists. Because enslaved people were &quot;property, not people&quot;, by this ruling they could not sue in court. The decision was finally reversed by the Civil Rights Act of 1865. In what is sometimes considered mere obiter dictum the Court went on to hold that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories because enslaved people are personal property and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protects property owners against deprivation of their property without due process of law. Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case, the Court stated in the Slaughter-House Cases that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which begins by stating, &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot;

==American Civil War and emancipation==

The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million enslaved people in designated areas of the Confederacy from &quot;slave&quot; to &quot;free.&quot; Its practical effect was that as soon as an enslaved person escaped from slavery, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the enslaved person became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their enslaved people as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all the designated enslaved people.

About 200,000 free Black people and former enslaved people served in the Union Army and Navy, thus providing a basis for a claim to full citizenship. The dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a severe negative impact on the Black population, with much sickness and death.

==Reconstruction==


The Civil Rights Act of 1866 made Black people full U.S. citizens (and this repealed the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision). In 1868, the 14th Amendment granted full U.S. citizenship to African Americans. The 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, extended the right to vote to Black males. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau was an important institution established to create social and economic order in Southern states.

After the Union victory over the Confederacy, a brief period of Southern Black progress, called Reconstruction, followed. During Reconstruction, the states that had seceded were readmitted into the Union. From 1865 to 1877, under the protection of Union troops, some strides were made toward equal rights for African Americans. Southern Black men began to vote and they were also elected to serve in the United States Congress as well as in local offices such as the office of sheriff. The safety which was provided by the troops did not last long, however, and white Southerners frequently terrorized Black voters. Coalitions of white and Black Republicans passed bills in order to establish the first public school systems in most states of the South, although sufficient funding was hard to find. Black people established their own churches, towns, and businesses. Tens of thousands migrated to Mississippi for the chance to clear and own their own land, as 90 percent of the bottomlands were undeveloped. By the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farmers who owned land in the Mississippi Delta bottomlands were Black.
Hiram Revels became the first African-American senator in the U.S. Congress in 1870. Other African Americans soon came to Congress from South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. These new politicians supported the Republicans and tried to bring further improvements to the lives of African Americans. Revels and others understood that white people may have felt threatened by the African-American congressmen. Revels stated, &quot;The white race has no better friend than I. I am true to my own race. I wish to see all done that can be done...to assist [Black men]in acquiring property, in becoming intelligent, enlightened citizens...but at the same time, I would not have anything done which would harm the white race,&quot; Blanche K. Bruce was the other African American who became a U.S. senator during this period. African Americans elected to the House of Representatives during this time included Benjamin S. Turner, Josiah T. Walls, Joseph H. Rainey, Robert Brown Elliot, Robert D. De Large, and Jefferson H. Long. Frederick Douglass also served in the different government jobs during Reconstruction, including Minister Resident and Counsel General to Haiti, Recorder of Deeds, and U.S. Marshall. Bruce became a Senator in 1874 and represented the state of Mississippi. He worked with white politicians from his region in order to hopefully help his fellow African Americans and other minority groups such as Chinese immigrants and Native Americans. He even supported efforts to end restrictions on former Confederates&#x27; political participation.

The aftermath of the Civil War accelerated the process of a national African-American identity formation. Some civil rights activists, such as W. E. B. Du Bois, disagree that identity was achieved after the Civil War. African Americans in the post-Civil War era were faced with many rules and regulations that, even though they were &quot;free&quot;, prevented them from enjoying the same amount of freedom as white citizens had. Tens of thousands of Black northerners left homes and careers and also migrated to the defeated South, building schools, printing newspapers, and opening businesses. As Joel Williamson puts it:
Many of the migrants, women as well as men, came as teachers sponsored by a dozen or so benevolent societies, arriving in the still turbulent wake of Union armies. Others came to organize relief for the refugees... Still others ... came south as religious missionaries... Some came south as business or professional people seeking opportunity on this ... special Black frontier. Finally, thousands came as soldiers, and when the war was over, many of [their] young men remained there or after a stay of some months in the North, they returned in order to complete their education.
==Nadir of American race relations==

The Jim Crow laws were state and local laws in the United States enacted between 1876 and 1965. They mandated de jure segregation in all public facilities, with a supposedly &quot;separate but equal&quot; status for Black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were usually inferior to those provided for white Americans, systematizing a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages.

In the face of years of mounting violence and intimidation directed at Blacks as well as whites sympathetic to their cause, the U.S. government retreated from its pledge to guarantee constitutional protections to freedmen and women. When President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew Union troops from the South in 1877 as a result of a national compromise on the election, Black people lost most of their political power. Men like Benjamin &quot;Pap&quot; Singleton began speaking of leaving the South. This idea culminated in the 1879–80 movement of the Exodusters, who migrated to Kansas, where Blacks had much more freedom and it was easier to acquire land.
When Democrats took control of Tennessee in 1888, they passed laws making voter registration more complicated and ended the most competitive political state in the South. Voting by Black people in rural areas and small towns dropped sharply, as did voting by poor whites.

From 1890 to 1908, starting with Mississippi and ending with Georgia, ten of eleven Southern states adopted new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most Black people and many poor whites. Using a combination of provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests, states dramatically decreased Black voter registration and turnout, in some cases to zero. The grandfather clause was used in many states temporarily to exempt illiterate white voters from literacy tests. As power became concentrated under the Democratic Party in the South, the party positioned itself as a private club and instituted white primaries, closing Black people out of the only competitive contests. By 1910 one-party white rule was firmly established across the South.

Although African Americans quickly started litigation to challenge such provisions, early court decisions at the state and national level went against them. In &quot;Williams v. Mississippi&quot; (1898), the US Supreme Court upheld state provisions. This encouraged other Southern states to adopt similar measures over the next few years, as noted above. Booker T. Washington, of Tuskegee Institute secretly worked with Northern supporters to raise funds and provide representation for African Americans in additional cases, such as &quot;Giles v. Harris&quot; (1903) and &quot;Giles v. Teasley&quot; (1904), but again the Supreme Court upheld the states.

Segregation for the first time became a standard legal process in the South; it was informal in Northern cities. Jim Crow limited Black access to transportation, schools, restaurants and other public facilities. Most southern blacks for decades continued to struggle in grinding poverty as agricultural, domestic and menial laborers. Many became sharecroppers, sharing the crop with the white land owners..

===Racial terrorism===
In 1865, the Ku Klux Klan, a secret white supremacist criminal organization dedicated to destroying the Republican Party in the South, especially by terrorizing Black leaders, was formed. Klansmen hid behind masks and robes to hide their identity while they carried out violence and property damage. The Klan used terrorism, especially murder and threats of murder, arson and intimidation. The Klan&#x27;s excesses led to the passage of legislation against it, and with Federal enforcement, it was destroyed by 1871.

The anti-Republican and anti-freedmen sentiment only briefly went underground, as violence arose in other incidents, especially after Louisiana&#x27;s disputed state election in 1872, which contributed to the Colfax and Coushatta massacres in Louisiana in 1873 and 1874. Tensions and rumors were high in many parts of the South. When violence erupted, African Americans consistently were killed at a much higher rate than were European Americans. Historians of the 20th century have renamed events long called &quot;riots&quot; in southern history. The common stories featured whites heroically saving the community from marauding Black people. Upon examination of the evidence, historians have called numerous such events &quot;massacres&quot;, as at Colfax, because of the disproportionate number of fatalities for Black people as opposed to whites. The mob violence there resulted in 40–50 Black people dead for each of the three whites killed.

While not as widely known as the Klan, the paramilitary organizations that arose in the South during the mid-1870s as the white Democrats mounted a stronger insurgency, were more directed and effective than the Klan in challenging Republican governments, suppressing the Black vote and achieving political goals. Unlike the Klan, paramilitary members operated openly, often solicited newspaper coverage, and had distinct political goals: to turn Republicans out of office and suppress or dissuade Black voting in order to regain power in 1876. Groups included the White League, that started from white militias in Grant Parish, Louisiana, in 1874 and spread in the Deep South; the Red Shirts, that started in Mississippi in 1875 but had chapters arise and was prominent in the 1876 election campaign in South Carolina, as well as in North Carolina; and other White Line organizations such as rifle clubs.
The Jim Crow era accompanied the most cruel wave of &quot;racial&quot; suppression that America has yet experienced. Between 1890 and 1940, millions of African Americans were disenfranchised, killed, and brutalized. According to newspaper records kept at the Tuskegee Institute, about 5,000 men, women, and children were murdered in documented extrajudicial mob violence—called &quot;lynchings.&quot; The journalist Ida B. Wells estimated that lynchings not reported by the newspapers, plus similar executions under the veneer of &quot;due process&quot;, may have amounted to about 20,000 killings.

Of the tens of thousands of lynchers and onlookers during this period, it is reported that fewer than 50 whites were ever indicted for their crimes, and only four were sentenced. Because Black people were disenfranchised, they could not sit on juries or have any part in the political process, including local offices. Meanwhile, the lynchings were used as a weapon of terror to keep millions of African-Americans living in a constant state of anxiety and fear.
Most Black people were denied their right to keep and bear arms under Jim Crow laws, and they were therefore unable to protect themselves or their families.

==Early civil rights movement==
In response to these and other setbacks, in the summer of 1905, W. E. B. Du Bois and 28 other prominent, African-American men met secretly at Niagara Falls, Ontario. There, they produced a manifesto in which they called for an end to racial discrimination, full civil liberties for African Americans and recognition of human brotherhood. The organization which they established came to be called the Niagara Movement. After the notorious Springfield, Illinois race riot of 1908, a group of concerned Whites joined the leadership of the Niagara Movement and formed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) a year later, in 1909. Under the leadership of Du Bois, the NAACP mounted legal challenges to segregation and it also lobbied legislatures on behalf of Black Americans.

While the NAACP used the court system to promote equality, at the local level, African Americans adopted a self-help strategy. They pooled their resources to create independent community and institutional lives for themselves. They established schools, churches, social welfare institutions, banks, African-American newspapers and small businesses which could serve their communities. The main organizer of national and local self-help organizations was Alabama educator Booker T. Washington.

Some Progressive Era reformers were concerned about the Black condition. In 1908 after the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot got him involved, Ray Stannard Baker published the book &quot;Following the Color Line: An Account of Negro Citizenship in the American Democracy&quot;, becoming the first prominent journalist to examine America&#x27;s racial divide; it was extremely successful. Sociologist Rupert Vance says it is:
:the best account of race relations in the South during the period—one that reads like field notes for the future historian. This account was written during the zenith of Washingtonian movement and shows the optimism that it inspired among both liberals and moderates. The book is also notable for its realistic accounts of Negro town life.

==Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance==

During the first half of the 20th century, the largest internal population shift in U.S. history took place. Starting about 1910, through the Great Migration over five million African Americans made choices and &quot;voted with their feet&quot; by moving from the South to northern and western cities in hopes of escaping political discrimination and hatred, violence, finding better jobs, voting and enjoying greater equality and education for their children.

In the 1920s, the concentration of Black people in New York led to the cultural movement known as the Harlem Renaissance, whose influence reached nationwide. Black intellectual and cultural circles were influenced by thinkers such as Aimé Césaire and Léopold Sédar Senghor, who celebrated Blackness, or négritude; arts and letters flourished. Writers Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, Claude McKay and Richard Wright; and artists Lois Mailou Jones, William H. Johnson, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence and Archibald Motley gained prominence.

The South Side of Chicago, a destination for many on the trains up from Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana, joined Harlem as a sort of Black capital for the nation. It generated flourishing businesses, music, arts and foods. A new generation of powerful African-American political leaders and organizations also came to the fore, Typified by Congressman William Dawson (1886–1970). Membership in the NAACP rapidly increased as it mounted an anti-lynching campaign in reaction to ongoing southern white violence against blacks. Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, the Nation of Islam, and union organizer A. Philip Randolph&#x27;s Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (part of the American Federation of labor) all were established during this period and found support among African Americans, who became urbanized.

==Black-owned businesses==
Businesses operated at the local level, and included beauty shops, barber shops, funeral parlors and the like. Booker T. Washington organized them nationally into the National Negro Business League. The more ambitious Black businessman with a larger vision avoided small towns and rural areas and headed to progressive large cities. They sent their children to elite Black colleges such as Howard, Spellman, and Morehouse; by the 1970s they were accepted in more than token numbers at national schools such as the Ivy League. Graduates were hired by major national corporations. They were active in the Urban League, the United Negro College Fund and the NAACP, and were much more likely to be Episcopalians than Baptists.

===Women in the beauty business===
Although most prominent African-American businesses have been owned by men, women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and Black people, and the Black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, Black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, &quot;Inside Black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization.&quot; Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the Black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges. The most famous entrepreneur was Madame C. J. Walker (1867–1919); she built a national franchise business called Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company based on her invention of the first successful hair straightening process.

==World War I==

===Soldiers===
The U.S. armed forces remained segregated during World War I. Still, many African Americans eagerly volunteered to join the Allied cause following America&#x27;s entry into the war. More than two million African-American men rushed to register for the draft. By the time of the armistice with Germany in November 1918, over 350,000 African Americans had served with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.

Most African American units were relegated to support roles and did not see combat. Still, African Americans played a significant role in America&#x27;s war effort. Four African American regiments were integrated into French units because the French suffered heavy losses and badly needed men after three years of a terrible war. One of the most distinguished units was the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters&quot;, which was on the front lines for six months, longer than any other American unit in the war. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the Legion of Merit.
From May 1918 to November 1918, the 371st and the 372nd American Regiments were integrated under the 157th Red Hand Division commanded by the French General Mariano Goybet. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army) by General Pershing. The African American Regiments earned glory in the decisive final offensive in Champagne region of France. The two Regiments were decorated by the French Croix de Guerre for their gallantry in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

December 12, 1918

General Order No. 245

&quot;The red hand division during nine days of violent fight was always an exceptional model for the victorious advance of the fourth army.
Dear Friends of America you will be back home to the other side of the ocean, don&#x27; t forget ‘’ The Red Hand Division.&quot;

&quot;Our friendship has been cemented in the blood of the brave and such a link will be never destroyed Remember your General who is proud to have commanded you and be sure of his endless recognition. .&quot;

General Goybet commanding the 157th Division.
During World War I, the 372nd Infantry Regiment was composed of segregated National Guard units as well as draftees.

Among these National Guard units, the 1st District of Columbia was re-designated the 1st Battalion of the 372nd Infantry.

In 1917, fearing espionage, D.C. National Guard elements were mobilized 12 days before the U.S. officially entered World War I to protect reservoirs and power plants around District of Columbia Military officials were concerned that too many of the D.C. units were made up of men with foreign roots, thus the job of protecting vital facilities fell to the all-black 1st Separate Infantry, the only unit the military believed could be trusted with this mission.
Eventually the 1st Separate was mustered into active service and re-designated the 1st Battalion of the 372nd Infantry. In France, unsure of what to do with an African-American regiment, the 372nd was attached to the French Army&#x27;s 157th &quot;Red Hand&quot; Division. The soldiers fought in Meuse-Argonne, Lorraine and Alsace, where they were awarded the Croix de Guerre—one of the highest honors bestowed by the French military. Général Goybet, the 157th commanding general, gave the unit a Red Hand insignia in honor of their service. The red hand appears today on the crest of the 372nd Military Police Battalion. Although many D.C. National Guard units were mobilized, the 372nd was the only one to actually see combat during the war.
Corporal Freddie Stowers of the 371st Infantry Regiment was posthumously awarded a Medal of Honor—the first African American to be so honored for actions in World War I. During action in France, Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being wounded twice. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight on a German machine gun nest near Bussy farm in Champagne, and eventually defeated the German troops.
Stowers was recommended for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but according to the Army, the nomination was misplaced. Many believed the recommendation had been intentionally ignored due to institutional racism in the Armed Forces. In 1990, under pressure from Congress, the Defense Department launched an investigation. Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. On April 24, 1991–73 years after he was killed in action—Stowers&#x27; two surviving sisters received the Medal of Honor from President George H. W. Bush at the White House.

===Home front and postwar===
With an enormous demand for expansion of the defense industries, the new draft law in effect, and the cut off of immigration from Europe, demand was very high for underemployed farmers from the South. Hundreds of thousands of African-Americans took the trains to Northern industrial centers in a dramatic historical event known as the Great Migration. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns in western Pennsylvania between 1890 and 1930 faced racial discrimination and limited economic opportunities. The Black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh&#x27;s Black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the Black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.
Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:
:Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process...In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.

After the war ended and the soldiers returned home, tensions were very high, with serious labor union strikes and inter-racial riots in major cities. The summer of 1919 was known as the Red Summer with outbreaks of racial violence killing about 1,000 people across the nation, most of whom were Black.

Nevertheless, the newly established Black communities in the North nearly all endured. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:
:Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated.

==New Deal==

The Great Depression hit Black America hard. In 1930, it was reported that 4 out of 5 Black people lived in the South, the average life expectancy for Black people was 15 years less than whites, and the Black infant mortality rate at 12% was double that of whites. In Chicago, Black people made up 4% of the population and 16% of the unemployed while in Pittsburgh blacks were 8% of the population and 40% of the unemployed. In January 1934, the journalist Lorena Hickok reported from rural Georgia that she had seen &quot;half-starved Whites and Blacks struggle in competition for less to eat than my dog gets at home, for the privilege of living in huts that are infinitely less comfortable than his kennel&quot;. She also described most Southern Black people who made worked as sharecroppers as living under a system very close to slavery. A visiting British journalist wrote she &quot;had traveled over most of Europe and part of Africa, but I have never seen such terrible sights as I saw yesterday among the sharecroppers of Arkansas&quot;.

The New Deal did not have a specific program for Black people only, but it sought to incorporate them in all the relief programs that it began. The most important relief agencies were the CCC for young men (who worked in segregated units), the FERA relief programs in 1933–35 (run by local towns and cities), and especially the WPA, which employed 2,000,000 or more workers nationwide under federal control, 1935–42. All races had had the same wage rates and working conditions in the WPA.

A rival federal agency was the Public Works Administration (PWA), headed by long-time civil rights activist Harold Ickes. It set quotas for private firms hiring skilled and unskilled Black people in construction projects financed through the PWA, overcoming the objections of labor unions. In this way, the New Deal ensured that blacks were 13% of the unskilled PWA jobs in Chicago, 60% in Philadelphia and 71% in Jacksonville, Florida; their share of the skilled jobs was 4%, 6%, and 17%, respectively. In the Department of Agriculture, there was a lengthy bureaucratic struggle in 1933–35 between one faction which favored rising prices for farmers vs. another faction which favored reforms to assist sharecroppers, especially Black ones. When one Agriculture Department official, Alger Hiss, in early 1935 wrote up a directive to ensure that Southern landlords were paying sharecroppers for their labor (which most of them did not), Senator Ellison D. Smith stormed into his office and shouted: &quot;Young fella, you can&#x27;t do this to my niggers, paying checks to them&quot;. The Agriculture Secretary, Henry A. Wallace, sided with Smith and agreed to cancel the directive. As it turned out, the most effective way for Black sharecroppers to escape a life of poverty in the South was to move to the North or California.

An immediate response was a shift in the Black vote in Northern cities from the GOP to the Democrats (blacks seldom voted in the South.) In Southern states where few Black people voted, Black leaders seized the opportunity to work inside the new federal agencies as social workers and administrators, with an eye to preparing a new generation who would become leaders of grass-roots constituencies that could be mobilized at some future date for civil rights. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed the first federal black judge, William H. Hastie, and created an unofficial &quot;black cabinet&quot; led by Mary McLeod Bethune to advise him. Roosevelt ordered that federal agencies such as the CCC, WPA and PWA were not to discriminate against Black Americans. The president&#x27;s wife, Eleanor Roosevelt (who was a close friend of Bethune&#x27;s), was notably sympathetic towards African-Americans and constantly in private urged her husband to do more to try help Black Americans. The fact that the Civil Works Administration paid the same wages to Black workers as white workers sparked much resentment in the South and as early as 1933 conservative Southern politicians who claiming that federal relief payments were causing Black people to move to the cities to become a &quot;permanent welfare class&quot;. Studies showed that Black people were twice likely to be unemployed as whites, and one-fifth of all people receiving federal relief payments were Black, which was double their share of the population.

In Chicago the Black community had been a stronghold of the Republican machine, but in the Great Depression the machine fell apart. Voters and leaders moved en masse into the Democratic Party as the New Deal offered relief programs and the city Democratic machine offered suitable positions in the Democratic Party for leaders such as William Dawson, who went to Congress.

Militants demanded a federal anti-lynching bill, but President Roosevelt knew it would never pass Congress but would split his New Deal coalition. Because conservative white Southerners tended to vote as a bloc for the Democratic Party with all of the Senators and Congressmen from the South in the 1930s being Democrats, this tended to pull the national Democratic Party to the right on many issues while Southern politicians formed a powerful bloc in Congress. When a Black minister, Marshall L. Shepard, delivered the opening prayer at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in 1936, Senator Ellison D. Smith stormed out, screaming: &quot;This mongrel meeting ain&#x27;t no place for a white man!&quot; Though Smith&#x27;s reaction was extreme, other Democratic politicians from the South made it clear to Roosevelt that they were very displeased. In the 1936 election, African-Americans who could vote overwhelmingly did so for Roosevelt, marking the first time that a Democratic candidate for president had won the Black vote.

In November 1936, the American duo Buck and Bubbles became the first Black people to appear on television, albeit on a British television channel.

In April 1937, Congressman Earl C. Michener read out on the floor of the House of Representatives an account of the lynching of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels in Duck Hill, Mississippi on 13 April 1937, describing in much detail how a white mob tied two Black men to a tree, tortured them with blowtorches, and finally killed them. Michener introduced an anti-lynching bill that passed the House, but which was stopped in the Senate as Southern senators filibustered the bill until it was withdrawn on 21 February 1938. Both civil rights leaders and the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, pressed President Roosevelt to support the anti-lynching bill, but his support was half-hearted at best. Roosevelt told Walter Francis White of the NAACP that he personally supported the anti-lynching bill, but that: &quot;I did not choose the tools with which I must work. Had I been permitted to choose them I would have selected quite different ones. But I&#x27;ve got to get legislation passed to save America. The Southerners by reason of the seniority rule in Congress are chairmen or occupy strategic places on most of the Senate and House committees. If I came out for the antilynching bill now, they will block every bill I ask Congress to pass to keep America from collapsing. I just can&#x27;t take the risk&quot;.

Through Roosevelt was sympathetic, and his wife even more so towards the plight of African-Americans, but the power of the Southern Democratic bloc in Congress, whom he did not wish to take on, limited his options. Through not explicitly designed to assist Black Americans, Roosevelt supported the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which imposed a national minimum wage of 40 cents per hour and a forty-hour work week while banning child labor, which was intended to assist poorer Americans. The Southern congressional bloc were vehemently opposed to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which they saw as an attack on the entire Southern way of life, which was based upon extremely low wages (for example the minimum wage was 50 cents per day in South Carolina), and caused some of them to break with Roosevelt. In 1938, Roosevelt campaigned in the Democratic primaries to defeat three conservative Southern Democratic senators, Walter F. George, Millard Tydings, and Ellison &quot;Cotton Ed&quot; Smith, whom were all returned. Later in 1938, the conservative Southern Democrats allied themselves with conservative Republicans, forming an alliance in Congress which sharply limited Roosevelt&#x27;s ability to pass liberal legislation.

After Congress passed the Selective Service Act in September 1940 establishing the draft, A. Philip Randolph, the president of all black Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters union had his union issue a resolution calling for the government to desegregate the military. As the First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt had attended the meeting of the brotherhood that passed the resolution, it was widely believed that the president was supportive. Randolph subsequently visited the White House on 27 September 1940, where President Roosevelt seemed to be equally sympathetic. Randolph felt very betrayed where he learned the military was to remain segregated after all despite the president&#x27;s warm words. Roosevelt had begun a program of rearmament, and feeling the president was not to be trusted, Randolph formed the March on Washington Movement, announcing plans for a huge civil rights march in Washington DC that would demand desegregation of the military and the factories in the defense industry on 1 July 1941.

In June 1941 as the deadline for the march approached, Roosevelt asked for it to be cancelled, saying that 100, 000 Black people demonstrating in Washington would create problems for him. On 18 June 1941, Randolph met with Roosevelt with the mayor of New York, Fiorello H. La Guardia serving as a mediator, where in a compromise it was agreed that the march would be cancelled in exchange for Executive Order 8802, which banned discrimination in factories making weapons for the military. In 1941, the Roosevelt administration, through officially neutral, was leaning in very Allied direction with the United States providing weapons to Great Britain and China (to be joined by the Soviet Union after 22 June 1941), and the president needed the co-operation of Congress as much possible, where isolationist voices were frequently heard. Roosevelt argued to Randolph that he could not antagonize the powerful bloc of conservative Southern Democrats in Congress, and desegregation of the military was out of the question as the Southern Democrats would never accept it; by contrast, as La Guardia pointed out, most of the factories in the defense industry were located in California, the Midwest and the Northeast.

===Cotton===
The largest group of Black people worked in the cotton farms of the Deep South as sharecroppers or tenant farmers; a few owned their farms. Large numbers of whites also were tenant farmers and sharecroppers. Tenant farming characterized the cotton and tobacco production in the post-Civil War South. As the agricultural economy plummeted in the early 1930s, all farmers in all parts of the nation were badly hurt. Worst hurt were the tenant farmers (who had relatively more control) and sharecroppers (who had less control), as well as daily laborers (mostly Black, with least control).

The problem was very low prices for farm products and the New Deal solution was to raise them by cutting production. It accomplished this in the South by the AAA, which gave landowners acreage reduction contracts, by which they were paid to &quot;not&quot; grow cotton or tobacco on a portion of their land. By law, they were required to pay the tenant farmers and sharecroppers on their land a portion of the money, but some cheated on this provision, hurting their tenants and croppers. The farm wage workers who worked directly for the landowner were mostly the ones who lost their jobs. For most tenants and sharecroppers the AAA was a major help. Researchers at the time concluded, &quot;To the extent that the AAA control-program has been responsible for the increased price [of cotton], we conclude that it has increased the amount of goods and services consumed by the cotton tenants and croppers.&quot; Furthermore, the landowners typically let their tenants and croppers use the land taken out of production for their own personal use in growing food and feed crops, which further increased their standard of living. Another consequence was that the historic high levels of turnover from year to year declined sharply, as tenants and coppers tend to stay with the same landowner. Researchers concluded, &quot;As a rule, planters seem to prefer Negroes to whites as tenants and coppers.&quot;

Once mechanization came to cotton (after 1945), the tenants and sharecroppers were largely surplus; they moved to towns and cities.

==World War II==

===A call for &quot;The Double Victory&quot;===
The African-American newspaper &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot; called for the &quot;double victory&quot; or &quot;Double V campaign&quot; in a 1942 editorial, saying that all Black people should work for &quot;victory over our enemies at home and victory over our enemies on the battlefield abroad&quot;. The newspaper argued that a victory of the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany, would be a disaster for African-Americans while at the same time the war presented the opportunity &quot;to persuade, embarrass, compel and shame our government and our nation...into a more enlightened attitude towards a tenth of its people&quot;. The slogan of a &quot;double victory&quot; over fascism abroad and racism at home was widely taken up by African-Americans during the war.

===Wartime service===

Over 1.9 million Black people served in uniform during World War II. They served in segregated units. Black women served in the Army&#x27;s WAAC and WAC, but very few served in the Navy.

The draft starkly exposed the poor living conditions of most African-Americans with the Selective Service Boards turning down 46% of the Black men called up on health grounds as compared to 30% of the white men called up. At least a third of the black men in the South called up by the draft boards turned out to be illiterate. Southern Black people fared badly on the Army General Classification Test (AGCT), an aptitude test designed to determine the most suitable role for those who were drafted, and which was not an IQ test. Of the Black men from the South drafted, 84% fell into the two lowest categories on the AGCT. Owing to the high failure rate caused by the almost non-existent education system for African-Americans in the South, the Army was forced to offer remedial instruction for Afro-Americans who fell into the lower categories of the AGCT. By 1945, about 150, 000 Black men had learned how to read and write while in the Army. The poor living conditions in rural America which afflicted both white and Black Americans led the Army to undertake remedial health work as well. Army optometrists fitted 2.25 million men suffering from poor eyesight with eyeglasses to allow them to be drafted while Army dentists fitted 2.5 million draftees who would have been otherwise disqualified for the bad state of their teeth with dentures.

Most of the Army&#x27;s 231 training camps were located in the South, which was mostly rural and where land was cheaper. Black people from outside of the South that were sent to the training camps found life in the South almost unbearable. Tensions at army and navy training bases between Black and white trainees resulted in several outbreaks of racial violence with Black trainees sometimes being lynched. In the so-called Battle of Bamber Bridge on 24–25 June 1943 in the Lancashire town of Bamber Bridge saw a shoot-out between white and Black soldiers that left one dead. In an attempt to solve the problem of racial violence, the War Department in 1943 commissioned the director Frank Capra to make the propaganda film &quot;The Negro Soldier&quot;.

The segregated 92nd Division, which served in Italy, was noted for the antagonistic relations between its white officers and Black soldiers. In an attempt to ease the racial tensions, the 92nd Division was integrated in 1944 by having the all Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team together with one white regiment assigned to it. The segregated 93rd Division, which served in the Pacific, was assigned &quot;mopping up&quot; duties on the islands that the Americans mostly controlled. Black servicemen greatly resented segregation and those serving in Europe complained that German POWs were served better food than what they were.

The Navy was segregated and Black sailors were usually assigned menial work such as stevedores. At Port Chicago on 17 July 1944, while mostly Black stevedores were loading up two Navy supply ships, an explosion occurred that killed 320 men, of which 202 were Black. The explosion was widely blamed on the lack of training for Black stevedores, and 50 of the survivors of the explosion refused an order to return to work, demanding safety training first. At the subsequent court martial for the &quot;Port Chicago 50&quot; on the charges of mutiny, their defense lawyer, Thurgood Marshall stated: &quot;Negroes in the Navy don&#x27;t mind loading ammunition. They just want to know why they are the only ones doing the loading! They want to know why they are segregated; why they don&#x27;t get promoted, and why the Navy disregarded official warnings by the San Francisco waterfront unions...that an explosion was inevitable if they persisted in using untrained seamen in the loading of ammunition&quot;. Though the sailors were convicted, the Port Chicago disaster led the Navy in August 1944 to allow Black sailors to serve alongside white sailors on ships, through Black people could only make up 10% of the crew.

Through the Army was reluctant to send Black units into combat, famous segregated units, such as the Tuskegee Airmen and the U.S. 761st Tank Battalion proved their value in combat. Approximately 75 percent of the soldiers who served in the European theater as truckers for the Red Ball Express and kept Allied supply lines open were African-American. During the crisis of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, the Army allowed several integrated infantry platoons to be formed, through these were broken up once the crisis passed. However, the experiment of the integrated platoons in December 1944 showed that integration did not mean the collapse of military discipline as many claimed that it would, and was a factor in the later desegregation of the armed forces. A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.

The distinguished service of these units was a factor in President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s order to end discrimination in the Armed Forces in July 1948, with the promulgation of Executive Order 9981. This led in turn to the integration of the Air Force and the other services by the early 1950s. In his book &quot;A Rising Wind&quot;, Walter Francis White of the NAACP wrote: &quot;World War II has immeasurably magnified the Negro&#x27;s awareness of the American profession and practice of democracy...[Black veterans] will return home convinced that whatever betterment of their lot is achieved must come largely from their own efforts. They will return determined to use those efforts to the utmost&quot;.

===Home front===
Due to massive shortages as a result of the American entry into World War II, defense employers from Northern and Western cities went to the South to convince blacks and whites there to leave the region in promise of higher wages and better opportunities. As a result, African Americans left the South in large numbers to munitions centers in the North and West to take advantage of the shortages caused by the war, sparking the Second Great Migration. While they somewhat lived in better conditions than the South (for instance, they could vote and send children to better schools), they nevertheless faced widespread discrimination due to bigotry and fear of competition of housing and jobs among white residents.

When Roosevelt learned that many companies in the defense industry were violating the spirit, if not the letter of Executive Order 8802 by only employing Black people in menial positions such as janitors and denying them the opportunity to work as highly paid skilled laborers, he significantly strengthened the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC) with orders to fine the corporations that did not treat their Black employees equally. In 1943, Roosevelt gave the FEPC a budget of half-million dollars and replaced the unpaid volunteers who had previously staffed the FEPC with a paid staff concentrated in regional headquarters across the nation with instructions to inspect the defense industry&#x27;s factories to ensure the spirit and letter of Executive Order 8802 was being obeyed. Roosevelt believed that having Black men and women employed in the defense industry working as skilled laborers would give them far higher wages than what they ever had before, and ultimately form the nucleus of a Black middle class. When the president learned that some unions were pushing for black employees to be given menial &quot;auxiliary&quot; jobs in the factories, he instructed the National Labor Relations Board to decertify those unions. In 1944, when the union for trolley drivers in Philadelphia went on strike to protest plans to hire African-Americans as trolley drivers, Roosevelt sent in troops to break the strike. In 1942, Black people made up 3% of the workforce in the defense industry; by 1945 Black people made up 8% of the workforce in defense industry factories (Black people made up 10% of the population).

Racial tensions were also high between whites and ethnic minorities that cities like Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Harlem experienced race riots in 1943. In May 1943, in Mobile, Alabama, when the local shipyard promoted some Black men up to be trained as welders, white workers rioted and seriously injured 11 of their Black co-workers. In Los Angeles, the Zoot Suit riots of 3–8 June 1943 saw white servicemen attacking &quot;Chicano&quot; (Mexican-American) and Black youths for wearing zoot suits. On 15 June 1943, in Beaumont, Texas, a pogrom saw a white mob smash up Black homes while lynching 2 Black men. In Detroit, which expanded massively during the war years with 50, 000 Black people from the South and 200, 000 &quot;hillbilly&quot; whites from Appalachia moving to the city to work in the factories, competition for sparse rental housing had pushed tensions to the brink. On 20 June 1943, false rumors that a white mob had lynched 3 Black men led to an outbreak of racial rioting in Detroit that left 34 dead, of whom 25 were Black. On 1–2 August 1943, another race riot in Harlem left 6 Black people dead.

Politically, Black people left the Republican Party and joined the Democratic New Deal Coalition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom they widely admired. The political leaders, ministers and newspaper editors who shaped opinion resolved on a Double V campaign: Victory over German and Japanese fascism abroad, and victory over discrimination at home. Black newspapers created the Double V campaign to build Black morale and head off radical action. During the war years, the NAACP expanded tenfold, having over half a million members by 1945. The new civil rights group Committee of Racial Equality (CORE), founded in 1942, started demonstrations demanding desegregation of buses, theaters and restaurants. At one CORE demonstration outside a segregated restaurant in Washington, DC in 1944 had signs reading &quot;We Die Together&#x27;, Let&#x27;s Eat Together&quot; and &quot;Are you for Hitler&#x27;s Way or the American Way?&quot;. In 1944, the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal published his bestselling book &quot;An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy&quot; where he described in much detail the effects of white supremacy upon Black Americans, and predicated in the long run the Jim Crow regime was unsustainable, as he argued that after the war African-Americans would be not willing to accept a permanent second class status.

Most Black women had been farm laborers or domestics before the war. Despite discrimination and segregated facilities throughout the South, they escaped the cotton patch and took blue-collar jobs in the cities. Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee, the NAACP and CIO unions, these Black women fought a Double V campaign against the Axis abroad and against restrictive hiring practices at home. Their efforts redefined citizenship, equating their patriotism with war work, and seeking equal employment opportunities, government entitlements, and better working conditions as conditions appropriate for full citizens. In the South, Black women worked in segregated jobs; in the West and most of the North they were integrated, but wildcat strikes erupted in Detroit, Baltimore, and Evansville where white migrants from the South refused to work alongside Black women. The most largest of the &quot;hate strikes&quot; was the strike by white women at the Western Electric factory in Baltimore, who objected to sharing a bathroom with Black women.

===Hollywood===
&quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943) (starring Lena Horne, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, and Cab Calloway&#x27;s Band), along with &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (1943) (starring Ethel Waters, Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson, Lena Horne, and Louis &quot;Satchmo&quot; Armstrong), and other musicals of the 1940s opened new roles for Black people in Hollywood. They broke through old stereotypes and far surpassed the limited, poorly paid roles available in race films produced for all-Black audiences.

==Second Great Migration==

The Second Great Migration was the migration of more than 5 million African Americans from the South to the other three regions of the United States. It took place from 1941 through World War II, and it lasted until 1970. It was much larger and of a different character than the first Great Migration (1910–1940). Some historians prefer to distinguish between the movements for those reasons.

In the Second Great Migration, more than five million African Americans moved to cities in states in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, including the West Coast, where many skilled jobs in the defense industry were concentrated. More of these migrants were already urban laborers who came from the cities of the South. They were better educated and they had better skills than the people who did not migrate.

Compared to the more rural migrants of the period 1910–40, many African Americans in the South were already living in urban areas and had urban job skills before they relocated. They moved to take jobs in the burgeoning industrial cities and especially the many jobs in the defense industry during World War II. Workers who were limited to segregated, low-skilled jobs in Southern cities were able to get highly skilled, well-paid jobs at West Coast shipyards. The effect of racially homogeneous communities composed largely of Black immigrants that formed because of spatial segregation in destination cities was that they were largely influenced by the Southern culture they brought with them. The food, music and even the discriminatory white police presence in these neighborhoods were all imported to a certain extent from the collective experiences of the highly concentrated African-American migrants. Writers have often assumed that Southern migrants contributed disproportionately to changes in the African-American family in the inner city. However, census data for 1940 through 1990 show that these families actually exhibited more traditional family patterns—more children living with two parents, more ever-married women living with their spouses, and fewer never-married mothers.

By the end of the Second Great Migration, African Americans had become an urbanized population. More than 80 percent of them lived in cities. Fifty-three percent of them remained in the Southern United States, 40 percent of them lived in the Northeast and North Central states and 7 percent of them lived in the West.

==Civil rights era==

The Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) of Topeka. This decision applied to public facilities, especially public schools. Reforms occurred slowly and only after concerted activism by African Americans. The ruling also brought new momentum to the Civil Rights Movement. Boycotts against segregated public transportation systems sprang up in the South, the most notable of which was the Montgomery bus boycott.

Civil rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) organized across the South with tactics such as boycotts, voter registration campaigns, Freedom Rides and other nonviolent direct action, such as marches, pickets and sit-ins to mobilize around issues of equal access and voting rights. Southern segregationists fought back to block reform. The conflict grew to involve steadily escalating physical violence, bombings and intimidation by Southern whites. Law enforcement responded to protesters with batons, electric cattle prods, fire hoses, attack dogs and mass arrests.

In Virginia, state legislators, school board members and other public officials mounted a campaign of obstructionism and outright defiance to integration called Massive Resistance. It entailed a series of actions to deny state funding to integrated schools and instead fund privately run &quot;segregation academies&quot; for white students. Farmville, Virginia, in Prince Edward County, was one of the plaintiff African-American communities involved in the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court decision. As a last-ditch effort to avoid court-ordered desegregation, officials in the county shut down the county&#x27;s entire public school system in 1959 and it remained closed for five years. White students were able to attend private schools established by the community for the sole purpose of circumventing integration. The largely Black rural population of the county had little recourse. Some families were split up as parents sent their children to live with relatives in other locales to attend public school; but the majority of Prince Edward&#x27;s more than 2,000 black children, as well as many poor whites, simply remained unschooled until federal court action forced the schools to reopen five years later.
Perhaps the high point of the Civil Rights Movement was the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which brought more than 250,000 marchers to the grounds of the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to speak out for an end to southern racial violence and police brutality, equal opportunity in employment, equal access in education and public accommodations. The organizers of the march were called the &quot;Big Six&quot; of the Civil Rights Movement: Bayard Rustin the strategist who has been called the &quot;invisible man&quot; of the Civil Rights Movement; labor organizer and initiator of the march, A. Philip Randolph; Roy Wilkins of the NAACP; Whitney Young, Jr., of the National Urban League; Martin Luther King Jr., of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); James Farmer of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE); and John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Also active behind the scenes and sharing the podium with King was Dorothy Height, head of the National Council of Negro Women. It was at this event, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, that King delivered his historic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

This march, the 1963 Birmingham Children&#x27;s Crusade, and other events were credited with putting pressure on President John F. Kennedy, and then Lyndon B. Johnson, that culminated in the passage the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.
The &quot;Mississippi Freedom Summer&quot; of 1964 brought thousands of idealistic youth, black and white, to the state to run &quot;freedom schools&quot;, to teach basic literacy, history and civics. Other volunteers were involved in voter registration drives. The season was marked by harassment, intimidation and violence directed at civil rights workers and their host families. The disappearance of three youths, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner in Philadelphia, Mississippi, captured the attention of the nation. Six weeks later, searchers found the savagely beaten body of Chaney, a Black man, in a muddy dam alongside the remains of his two white companions, who had been shot to death. There was national outrage at the escalating injustices of the &quot;Mississippi Blood Summer&quot;, as it by then had come to be known, and at the brutality of the murders.

In 1965, the Selma Voting Rights Movement, its Selma to Montgomery marches, and the tragic murders of two activists associated with the march, inspired President Lyndon B. Johnson to call for the full Voting Rights Act of 1965, which struck down barriers to black enfranchisement. In 1966 the Chicago Open Housing Movement, followed by the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, was a capstone to more than a decade of major legislation during the civil rights movement.

By this time, African Americans who questioned the effectiveness of nonviolent protest had gained a greater voice. More militant Black leaders, such as Malcolm X of the Nation of Islam and Eldridge Cleaver of the Black Panther Party, called for Black people to defend themselves, using violence, if necessary. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the Black Power movement urged African Americans to look to Africa for inspiration and emphasized Black solidarity, rather than integration.

==Post-civil rights era==


Politically and economically, Black people have made substantial strides in the post-civil rights era. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who ran for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, brought unprecedented support and leverage to Black people in politics.

In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African-American elected governor in U.S. history. In 1992 Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois became the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate. There were 8,936 Black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 Black mayors.

The 39 African-American members of Congress form the Congressional Black Caucus, which serves as a political bloc for issues relating to African Americans. The appointment of Black people to high federal offices—including General Colin Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1989–93, United States Secretary of State, 2001–05; Condoleezza Rice, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 2001–04, Secretary of State in, 2005–09; Ron Brown, United States Secretary of Commerce, 1993–96; and Supreme Court justices Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas—also demonstrates the increasing visibility of Black people in the political arena.

Economic progress for Black people reaching the extremes of wealth has been slow. According to Forbes richest lists, Oprah Winfrey was the richest African American of the 20th century and has been the world&#x27;s only Black billionaire in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Not only was Winfrey the world&#x27;s only Black billionaire but she has been the only Black person on the Forbes 400 list nearly every year since 1995. BET founder Bob Johnson briefly joined her on the list from 2001 to 2003 before his ex-wife acquired part of his fortune; although he returned to the list in 2006, he did not make it in 2007. With Winfrey the only African American wealthy enough to rank among America&#x27;s 400 richest people, African Americans currently comprise 0.25% of America&#x27;s economic elite and comprise 13.6% of the U.S. population.

The dramatic political breakthrough came in the 2008 election, with the election of Barack Obama, the son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother. He won overwhelming support from African-American voters in the Democratic primaries, even as his main opponent Hillary Clinton had the support of many Black politicians. African Americans continued to support Obama throughout his term. After completing his first term, Obama ran for a second term. In 2012, he won the presidential election against candidate Mitt Romney and was re-elected as the president of the United States.

The post-civil rights era is also notable for the New Great Migration, in which millions of African Americans have returned to the South including Texas, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina, often to pursue increased economic opportunities in now-desegregated southern cities.

On August 11, 2020, Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) was announced as the first African-American woman to run for vice-president on a major party presidential ticket. She was elected vice president in the 2020 United States presidential election. On August 5, 2024 Harris became the second woman and first African American woman to be a major party&#x27;s presidential nominee following a virtual roll call from the DNC, in the aftermath of president Joe Biden suspended his campaign. She would lose the election to Donald Trump.

===Social issues===
After the civil rights movement gains of the 1950s–1970s, due to government neglect, unfavorable social policies, high poverty rates, changes implemented in the criminal justice system and laws, and a breakdown in traditional family units, African-American communities have been suffering from extremely high incarceration rates. African Americans have the highest imprisonment rate of any major ethnic group in the world. The Southern states, which historically had been involved in slavery and post-Reconstruction oppression, now produce the highest rates of incarceration and death penalty application.

==Religion==
By 1800, a small number of slaves had joined Christian churches. Free Black people in the North set up their own networks of churches and in the South the slaves sat in the upper galleries of white churches. Central to the growth of community among Blacks was the Black church, usually the first communal institution to be established. The Black church was both an expression of community and unique African-American spirituality, and a reaction to discrimination. The churches also served as neighborhood centers where free Black people could celebrate their African heritage without intrusion from white detractors. The church also served as the center of education. Since the church was part of the community and wanted to provide education; it educated the freed and enslaved Black people. Seeking autonomy, some Black people like Richard Allen founded separate Black denominations.

The Second Great Awakening (1800–1830s) has been called the &quot;central and defining event in the development of Afro-Christianity.&quot;

==Historiography==
The history of slavery in the United States has always been a major research topic among white scholars, but until the 1950s, they generally focused on the political and constitutional themes of slavery which were debated over by white politicians; they did not study the lives of the enslaved black people. During Reconstruction and the late 19th century, Black people became major actors in the South. The Dunning School of white scholars generally cast Black people as pawns of white Carpetbaggers during this period, but W. E. B. Du Bois, a Black historian, and Ulrich B. Phillips, a white historian, studied the African-American experience in depth. Du Bois&#x27; study of Reconstruction provided a more objective context for evaluating its achievements and weaknesses; Additionally, he conducted studies of contemporary Black life. Phillips set the main topics of inquiry that still guide the analysis of slave economics.

During the first half of the 20th century, Carter G. Woodson was the major Black scholar who studied and promoted the Black historical experience. Woodson insisted that the scholarly study of the African-American experience should be sound, creative, restorative, and, most important, it should be directly relevant to the Black community. He popularized Black history with a variety of innovative strategies, including the founding of the Association for the Study of Negro Life, the development of outreach activities, the creation of Negro History Week (now Black History Month, in February), and the publication of a popular Black history magazine. Woodson democratized, legitimized, and popularized Black history.

Benjamin Quarles (1904–1996) had a significant impact on the teaching of African-American history. Quarles and John Hope Franklin provided a bridge between the work of historians in historically Black colleges, such as Woodson, and the Black history that is now well established in mainline universities. Quarles grew up in Boston, attended Shaw University as an undergraduate, and received a graduate degree at the University of Wisconsin. In 1953, he began teaching at Morgan State College in Baltimore, where he stayed, despite the fact that he received a lucrative offer from Johns Hopkins University. Quarles&#x27; books included &quot;The Negro in the Civil War&quot; (1953), &quot;The Negro in the American Revolution&quot; (1961), &quot;Lincoln and the Negro&quot; (1962), &quot;The Negro in the Making of America&quot; (1964, updated 1987), and &quot;Black Abolitionists&quot; (1969), which are all narrative accounts of critical wartime episodes that focused on how Black people interacted with their white allies.

Black historians attempted to reverse centuries of ignorance. While they were not alone in advocating a new examination of slavery and racism in the United States, the study of African-American history has frequently been a political and scholarly struggle which has been waged by historians who wish to refute incorrect assumptions. One of the foremost assumptions was the belief that enslaved people did not rebel because they were passive. A series of historians transformed the image of African Americans, revealing that they had a much richer and a more complex experience. Historians such as Leon F. Litwack documented how former enslaved people fought to keep their families together and he also documented that they struggled against tremendous odds in order to define themselves as free people. Other historians wrote about rebellions, both small and large.

In the 21st century, Black history is considered mainstream. Since it was recognized by President Gerald Ford in 1976, &quot;Black History Month&quot; is celebrated in the United States every year during the month of February. Proponents of Black history believe that it promotes diversity, develops self-esteem, and corrects myths and stereotypes. Opponents of it argue that such curricula are dishonest, divisive, and lack academic credibility and rigor.

In 2021, College Board announced that it will pilot an AP African American Studies course between 2022 and 2024. The course is expected to be launched in 2024. The goal of the course is to expand student understanding of black history, culture, art, literature, and academics.

===Knowledge of Black history===
Surveys of 11th- and 12th-grade students and adults in 2005 show that American schools have given students an awareness of some famous figures in Black history. Both groups were asked to name 10 famous Americans, excluding presidents. Of those named, the three most mentioned were Black: 67% named Martin Luther King Jr., 60% Rosa Parks, and 44% Harriet Tubman. Among adults, King was second (at 36%) and Parks was tied for fourth with 30%, while Tubman tied for 10th place with Henry Ford, at 16%. When distinguished historians were asked in 2006 to name the most prominent Americans, Parks and Tubman did not make the top 100.

<doc id="1142438" wikidata="Q3032417" url="?curid=1142438" title="Division of Kingston">
<text>The Division of Kingston is an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia covering the outer southern suburbs of Adelaide. The 171 km2 seat stretches from Hallett Cove and O&#x27;Halloran Hill in the north to Maslin Beach in the south, including the suburbs of Aberfoyle Park, Christie Downs, Christies Beach, Flagstaff Hill, Hackham, Hallett Cove, Huntfield Heights, Lonsdale, Maslin Beach, Moana, Morphett Vale, Old Noarlunga, Onkaparinga Hills, Port Noarlunga, Reynella, Seaford, Sheidow Park, Port Willunga, Trott Park, Woodcroft, and parts of Happy Valley and McLaren Flat.

==History==

The division was named after Charles Kingston, Premier of South Australia (1893–1899), elected to the first House of Representatives in 1901 and the first Federal member of the Division of Adelaide in 1903. Kingston was first based on the Holdfast Bay area to the north of the current boundaries from the 1949 election as a notionally marginal to fairly safe Labor seat. However, it fell to the Liberals in that election, only to have Labor win it at the 1951 election. This started a tradition of Labor and the Liberals alternating for long spells in a seat that has slowly moved south over the decades. It has now moved almost clear of its original boundaries; Hallett Cove is the only suburb within the seat&#x27;s current borders that was part of the seat in 1949.

It has tended to elect an MP from the governing party of the day, having elected only four opposition MPs. Notably, every sitting member in the electorate&#x27;s history has been defeated at the polls—none have retired or resigned.

Kingston has been represented by Labor MP Amanda Rishworth since the 2007 election where she won with a 54.4 percent two-party vote from a 4.5 percent swing. Going into the 2010 election, it was the most marginal Labor seat in South Australia. However, Rishworth consolidated her hold on the seat in 2010 by winning a 64 percent two-party vote from a 9.5 percent swing. At the 2013 election, Rishworth suffered a 4.9 percent swing to finish on a 59.7 percent two-party vote, but was still the second largest vote of any party in Kingston&#x27;s history. In 2016, Rishworth further strengthened her hold on Kingston by boosting her majority to 67.1 percent on a swing of 7.7 percent, the strongest result in the seat&#x27;s history. It is now Labor&#x27;s second-safest seat in South Australia, behind only Port Adelaide, on two-party terms, however on the primary vote Kingston polled one percent higher at over 49 percent, the highest primary vote of South Australia&#x27;s 11 seats. Though Labor picked up a two-party swing in all eleven seats, the presence of Nick Xenophon Team candidates in all eleven seats produced, apart from a suppressed major party primary vote, a result where Rishworth was the only major party candidate in the state to pick up a primary vote swing.

==Redistributions==

Kingston began to move south from 1969 when the Holdfast Bay area was transferred to the newly created seat of Hawker. Successive redistributions saw Hawker continue to push Kingston south over time, and by 1984 the seat had moved to roughly its current position, though without the current southern coastal strip.

Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The redistribution before the 2013 election removed Kingston&#x27;s rural areas with the transfer of around 6,500 voters in McLaren Vale and Willunga to Mayo, increasing Labor&#x27;s Kingston margin by half a percent. This substantially reduced the area covered by the electorate, down from 377 to 171 square kilometres, almost the same as the 2001 to 2004 boundaries. The previous larger boundaries were used from 2004 to 2013 and loosely from 1993 to 1998.

<doc id="1142439" wikidata="Q1332059" url="?curid=1142439" title="Midlife crisis">
<text>A midlife crisis is a transition of identity and self-confidence that can occur in middle-aged individuals, typically 45 to 64/65 years old. The phenomenon is described as a psychological crisis brought about by events that highlight a person&#x27;s growing age, inevitable mortality, and possible lack of accomplishments in life. This may produce feelings of intense depression, remorse, and high levels of anxiety; or the desire to achieve youthfulness, make drastic changes to their current lifestyle, or change past decisions and events.

==Crisis versus stressors==
Personality and a history of psychological crisis are believed to predispose some people to this &quot;traditional&quot; midlife crisis.
People going through this have a variety of symptoms and exhibit a disparate range of behaviors.

Mid-life is the time from years 40-60 where a person is often evaluating their own life. However, many mid-life stressors are often labeled as a mid-life crisis. Day-to-day stressors are likely to add up and be thought of as a crisis, but in reality, it is simply an &quot;overload&quot;. Individuals in mid-life often become overwhelmed by the fact that they have more control over their life than they did in younger years, and have more control than they will in later years. This realization of greater individual control acts as a stressor as it pertains to a midlife crisis. 

Many middle-aged adults experience major life events that can cause a period of psychological stress or depression, such as the death of a loved one, or a career setback. However, those events could have happened earlier or later in life, making them a &quot;crisis,&quot; but not necessarily a mid-life one. In the same study, 15% of middle-aged adults experienced this type of midlife turmoil. While those who are of a lower educational status and those who have a higher educational status have an equal number of stressors, it is those who have received lower education who feel those stressors much more and those stressors contribute much more to a mid-life crisis.

Studies indicate that some cultures may be more sensitive to this phenomenon than others; one study found that there is little evidence that people undergo midlife crises in Japanese and Indian cultures, raising the question of whether a mid-life crisis is mainly a cultural construct. It appears that the experience of increasing in age into what is considered old is significantly different in each culture. The authors hypothesized that the &quot;culture of youth&quot;, the prolonging of youth practices, and the emerging adult development phase in Western societies accounts for the popularity of the mid-life crisis concept there. 
Researchers have found that mid-life is often a time for reflection and reassessment, but this is not always accompanied by the psychological upheaval popularly associated with a &quot;mid-life crisis.&quot; Those who made career or job changes early in life were less likely to experience a crisis in midlife.

==Occurrence==
The condition may occur from the ages of 40–60. Because there is often a wide variety of factors that can contribute to the cause of a midlife crisis, there is not a noticeable difference between how men and women experience midlife crises. A mid-life crisis could be caused by aging itself, or aging in combination with changes, problems, or regrets over:

*work or career (or lack thereof)
*spousal relationships (or lack thereof)
*maturation of children (or their absence) 
*aging or death of parents
*physical changes associated with aging

Mid-life crisis can affect men and women differently because their stressors differ. An American cultural stereotype of a man going through a midlife crisis may include the purchase of a luxury item such as an exotic car, or seeking intimacy with a younger woman. Some men seek younger women who are able to procreate, not necessarily with an intention to produce offspring. A man&#x27;s midlife crisis is more likely to be caused by work issues, a woman&#x27;s crisis by personal evaluations of their roles. Even though there are differences between why men and women go through a midlife crisis, the emotions they both encounter can be intense.

One of the main characteristics of a mid-life crisis is that one assumes their mid-life is about to be eventful, usually in a negative way, and potentially stressful. Psychologist Oliver Robinson&#x27;s research characterizes each decade of life by describing frequent occurrences or situations particular to those age periods. He describes that a crisis can begin in a person&#x27;s early 20s, when they usually try to map out their whole life. Moreover, the later age period, between 50 and 60, may be a time of illness or even the thought of death. Such a deadline may convince a middle-aged person that their life needs to be lived as expected.

Individuals experiencing a mid-life crisis may feel:

*a deep sense of remorse for goals that have not been accomplished
*a fear of humiliation among more successful colleagues
*longing to achieve a feeling of youthfulness
*need to spend more time alone or with certain peers
*a heightened sense of their sexuality or lack of it
* boredom, confusion, resentment or anger due to their discontent with their marital, work, health, economic, or social status
*ambition to right the missteps they feel they have taken early in life

==Treatment and prevention==
Physical changes that commonly occur during these years are weight gain, wrinkles, sagging skin, and hair loss.
Regular exercise and maintenance of a nutritious diet may help to sustain one&#x27;s physical and mental health during these years of transition.
Significant changes made early in life may prevent one from having a mid-life crisis. An example supporting such a theory can be derived from the research conducted by Susan Krauss Whitbourne. People who changed jobs before their midlife years had a greater sense of generativity when they reached mid-life. They also experienced a greater sense of motivation to deviate from stagnation and a desire to help the younger generation thrive. This is a psychological stage proposed by Erik Erikson that describes the normal stage adults go through during their mid-life years.

== Theoretical basis ==
The notion of the mid-life crisis began with followers of Sigmund Freud, who thought that during middle age everyone&#x27;s thoughts were driven by the fear of impending death. Although mid-life crisis has lately received more attention in popular culture than serious research, there are some theoretical constructs supporting the notion. Jungian theory holds that mid-life is key to individuation, a process of self-actualization and self-awareness that contains many potential paradoxes. Although Carl Jung did not describe midlife crisis &quot;per se&quot;, the mid-life integration of thinking, sensation, feeling, and intuition that he describes could, it seems, lead to confusion about one&#x27;s life and goals.

Erik Erikson&#x27;s life stage of generativity versus stagnation also coincides with the idea of a mid-life crisis. Erikson believed that in this stage adults begin to understand the pressure of being committed to improving the lives of generations to come. In this stage a person realizes the inevitability of mortality and the virtue of this stage is the creating of a better world for future generations in order for the human race to grow. If generativity is not established a person will fall into a state of self-absorption in which their personal needs and comforts become their main concern. Stagnation is the lack of psychological movement or growth. Instead of helping the community a person is barely able to help their own family. Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others.

==Criticism==

Some people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a &quot;midlife crisis,&quot; but in digging deeper, only one-third of those—8% of the total—said the crisis was associated with awareness of aging.

The balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as divorce or loss of a job in middle age and described them as &quot;midlife crisis&quot;. While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic—the associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from depression.

Costa and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in neuroticism in midlife. While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation.

Wrapping up their review of men&#x27;s mid-life crisis, Aldwin and Levenson wrote that &quot;... Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.&quot; They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women&#x27;s mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the &quot;sandwich&quot; of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological &quot;crisis&quot;.

The enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: &quot;... younger men, now middle-aged Baby Boomers, used the term &quot;midlife crisis&quot; to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.&quot;

Levenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994), McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson&#x27;s model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential &quot;crisis&quot;. Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis.

Recently, a new study by Giuntella et al. (2022), circulated as a working paper at the National Bureau of Economic Research, attempts to provide hard evidence on the presence of a midlife crisis. Using longitudinal data on 500,000 individuals, they document a crisis of midlife in affluent nations. This confirms academic work previously done using subjective well-being data. They find that &quot;midlife is a time when people disproportionately take their own lives, have trouble sleeping, are clinically depressed, spend time thinking about suicide, feel life is not worth living, find it hard to concentrate, forget things, feel overwhelmed in their workplace, suffer from disabling headaches, and become dependent on alcohol.&quot; Given access to a rich set of controls, their results do not depend on a single nation, nor is a function of the presence of young children, nor related to workers&#x27; productivity. Additionally, the effect is robust to cohort effects. Patterns of the male midlife crisis mimick that of female&#x27;s. This reduces the likelihood that the crisis is caused by gender-related differences. &quot;

Many view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively. Instead of a mid-life crisis being a crisis it can be an opportunity for growth and progress towards goals. Middle life is important for exploration and growth. It is the crisis parts that can allow a person to re-evaluate how they are progressing towards their goal and make substantial changes to their life to allow them to obtain those goals.

If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding. If treated as a transitional phase, psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self-growth and self-realization.

<text>The Division of Blair is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The current MP is Shayne Neumann of the Australian Labor Party (ALP).

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==
The division was created in 1998 and is named after Harold Blair, an Aboriginal singer and civil rights campaigner. The Division is based on Ipswich, and extends from rural and exurban areas west of Brisbane to the Scenic Rim and Lockyer Valley regions.

The founder of One Nation, Pauline Hanson, contested Blair in 1998. Her previous seat, Oxley, had been essentially split in half in the redistribution ahead of the election. Oxley was reconfigured into an exclusively Brisbane-based seat that tilted strongly toward Labor, while most of the rural area near Ipswich shifted to Blair. Although it was a very safe Liberal seat on paper, it contained most of Hanson&#x27;s base, so it was a natural choice for Hanson to attempt to transfer. The Liberals, Nationals and Labor preferenced each other ahead of Hanson, allowing Liberal challenger Cameron Thompson to win on the eighth count. Thompson overtook the Labor candidate on National preferences, then defeated Hanson on Labor preferences.

Thompson held the seat without serious difficulty in the next two elections, and it was widely considered as a safe Liberal seat. In the 2006 redistribution, the 2004 Liberal margin of 11.2% was almost halved to 5.7%. Conservative-leaning Esk, Nanango and Kingaroy were transferred to Maranoa, while Blair was pushed further into Ipswich and Boonah. Blair had been rated as having received more funding promises from the Howard government than any other electorate in the country. The redistribution pushed Blair just outside the range of seats Labor needed to win government. In the 2007 election, Thompson was defeated by Labor challenger Shayne Neumann, with a 10.2 percent swing to Labor. Since then, the growth of Ipswich has allowed Neumann to consolidate his hold on the seat. For instance, in 2013, he actually picked up a small swing in his favour even as Labor lost government. In 2016, Neumann made Blair a safe Labor seat with 58.9 percent of the vote. However, in the following 2019 Federal Election, Neumann suffered one of the largest swings against a Labor member, with a primary vote of just 31.3%, cutting the two-party preferred vote to 51.2%, a massive and unexpected swing against him of 6.9% on a two-party preferred basis. This was in keeping with the heavy swing to the Liberal National Party (LNP) in Queensland in that election. In 2022 the seat swung back to Neumann somewhat, with 35% of the primary vote and 55.2% of the two-party preferred vote, with the 4.02% swing in his favour slightly higher than the national swing to Labor of 3.66%.

Adriano finished within the top 10 of the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2004 and 2005 and was awarded the IFFHS World&#x27;s Top Goal Scorer of 2005 and was also a three-time winner of Bidone d&#x27;Oro award. He was a key figure in Inter&#x27;s 2005–06 Scudetto win before his career was, however, marked by inconsistency and a decline in his performances which coincided with the death of his father. He moved back to his native Brazil in 2009 and went on to win a Brasileirão with both Flamengo and Corinthians. He retired in 2016 at the age of 34.

Making his Brazil debut at 18, Adriano was considered the long-term successor to Ronaldo. In the absence of Ronaldo, he led Brazil to the 2004 Copa América, receiving the Golden Boot as the competition&#x27;s leading scorer with seven goals. He also won the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup with Brazil, receiving the Golden Boot Award as the competition&#x27;s leading scorer with five goals. Before the 2006 World Cup he was part of Brazil&#x27;s much-vaunted &quot;magic quartet&quot; of offensive players alongside Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaká, which ultimately was not successful at the tournament.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Adriano started his career in 1999 on Flamengo&#x27;s youth squad and earned promotion to the senior squad one year later. He made his team debut on 2 February 2000, a Torneio Rio-São Paulo match against Botafogo. He scored a goal against São Paulo in the same competition 4 days later.

Despite signing a two-year contract with Flamengo in June 2000, he secured a move to Inter Milan for the 2001–02 season. Inter sold another half of Vampeta to PSG (ultimately to Flamengo from PSG for an undisclosed fee) for €9.757 million in exchange for Adriano who was valued €13.189 million. Adriano scored his first goal with the club against Real Madrid in a friendly match as a substitute.

===Parma===
Adriano was loaned to Fiorentina for the 2001–02 season, after which a two-year co-ownership deal with Parma was agreed, for €8.8 million, in order to acquire Fabio Cannavaro which also included another half of Matteo Ferrari for €5.7 million He formed an impressive striking duo with Adrian Mutu, scoring 22 goals in 36 appearances. He missed the month of November 2003 due to injury.

===Return to Inter Milan===
Adriano returned to the San Siro in January 2004 on a -year contract, for about €23.4 million and scored a total of 12 goals in the rest of 2003–04 season. From 11 July 2004 through 29 June 2005, Adriano was in peak form, scoring 42 goals in both domestic and international competitions. He was voted sixth for the 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year. In September 2005, Inter rewarded him for his efforts with an improved contract running until 30 June 2010.

Following the signing of the new deal, Adriano&#x27;s future at Inter suffered due to poor performances, fueled by questions and speculation regarding his work ethic, which was called into question when he was twice caught partying at nightclubs during the 2006–07 campaign. Brazilian coach Dunga did not call Adriano up for a friendly against Ecuador on 10 October 2006, and called for him to &quot;change his behavior&quot; and &quot;focus on football&quot;. On 18 February 2007, Adriano skipped a team practice due to effects from a lengthy celebration of his birthday the night before, which led to Inter manager Roberto Mancini benching him for the team&#x27;s Champions League match against Valencia and subsequent Serie A fixture against Catania.

====Loan to São Paulo====
On 16 November 2007, Inter owner Massimo Moratti sent Adriano on unpaid leave to his native Brazil for the second time in eighteen months, where he attended São Paulo&#x27;s training center, due to his poor physical condition and a past battle with alcoholism. Though his agent denied Adriano&#x27;s desire to return to Brazilian club football, Adriano claimed he was willing to leave Inter in the January transfer window in search of regular playing time, with the Italian press stating interest from West Ham United and Manchester City. In December 2007, Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra expressed interest in bringing Adriano to the club during the January transfer window, commenting, &quot;Adriano was a top player, but he lost form when his father died, and he put on weight.&quot;

Moratti, however, stated that Adriano would remain with Inter. &quot;I would like him back here in January, as strong and as good as he was.&quot; On 10 December, Inter technical director Marco Branca said that Adriano was expected to rejoin the team at the start of the new year. &quot;[The] news has been good. We intend to leave him in peace until the end of the programme and then he will be treated like the other players.&quot; Inter finalized a deal on 19 December to loan Adriano to São Paulo for the remainder of the 2007–08 season to allow him to compete in the 2008 Copa Libertadores. São Paulo fans were soon seen standing in long lines to buy his new number 10 jersey at the team&#x27;s official merchandise retailer after Adriano was introduced and his shirt was unveiled at a team press conference. Adriano celebrated his competitive debut with São Paulo by scoring both goals in their 2–1 victory over Guaratinguetá on the opening day of the 2008 Paulista tournament.

He was sent off after headbutting Santos centre-back Domingos on 10 February 2008, and was suspended for two matches after initially risking a suspension of eighteen months. He was fined by São Paulo on 29 February for arriving 30  minutes late for training, then leaving early and exchanging words with a photographer. According to team sporting director Marco Aurélio Cunha, Adriano &quot;left the training ground because he wanted to. The team does not miss him. If he is not happy in São Paulo, he is free to go.&quot; São Paulo sporting director Carlos Augusto de Barros e Silva announced on 17 June that Adriano was returning to Inter ahead of schedule. &quot;We have a balanced squad and it was better for Adriano to go back, given that we won&#x27;t be able to count on him for the rest of the campaign.&quot;

====2008–09 season====

Adriano was a regular goalscorer in the early stages of the 2008–09 Serie A campaign, reaching a combined total of 100 domestic goals in the Italian Serie A and the Brazilian Série A. On 22 October 2008, Adriano scored the winner in a 1–0 win over Anorthosis Famagusta, and, with this goal, Adriano scored his 18th Champions League goal, and 70th for the club.

In December, Inter Milan allowed him special dispensation to return to Brazil over the winter break earlier than planned. Inter confirmed on 4 April that Adriano had not returned from international duty with Brazil and had signed no contract with the club. On 24 April, Adriano finally rescinded his contract with Inter.

===Second stint at Flamengo===

Adriano signed a one-year contract for Brazilian club Flamengo on 6 May 2009, the club with which he started his career. On his debut after returning to Flamengo, played on 31 May 2009, he scored a goal against Atlético Paranaense. On 21 June 2009, he scored his first hat-trick for Flamengo in the 4–0 win over Internacional in the Brazilian Série A; his performances would be instrumental to lead Flamengo to their first Brazilian Serie A title since 1992.

On 31 January 2010, Adriano scored his second hat-trick since his return, this time in a 5–3 comeback win in the Fla-Flu derby against rivals Fluminense in the 2010 Rio de Janeiro State League.

===Roma===
On 8 June 2010, Italian Serie A club Roma announced that Adriano had signed a three-year contract with the club, effective on 1 July, earning a gross annual salary of €5 million. He was then presented to the press with the no. 8 shirt. Roma terminated the contract on 8 March 2011, after seven months in the Italian capital.

===Corinthians===
On 25 March 2011, he signed a one-year deal with Corinthians. Adriano ruptured his Achilles tendon on 19 April, while he was training after the surgery he spent six months recovering. After recovering, he played his first game for Corinthians on 9 October 2011, when his club beat Atlético Goianiense 3–0. His first goal for Corinthians came on 20 October in the home game versus Atlético Mineiro, and was the winning goal that made the game 2–1 and gave Corinthians a two-point lead in the Championship with only two games remaining. On 12 March 2012, Adriano was released by Corinthians, after his irregular appearances and lack of interest.

===Third stint at Flamengo===
On 21 August 2012, Adriano signed a contract with Flamengo. On 7 November 2012, he was released by Flamengo.

===Atlético Paranaense===
On 11 February 2014, the Brazilian striker signed a deal with Atlético Paranaense. On 11 April 2014, he was released by Atlético Paranaense. 

===Miami United and retirement===
On 28 January 2016, Adriano signed a contract with Miami United of the National Premier Soccer League. On 28 May 2016 he left Miami United.

==International career==
Adriano made his international debut for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Colombia on 15 November 2000 at the age of 18. He was often considered as the long-term successor to Ronaldo. Adriano scored his first international goal on 11 June 2003 in a friendly against Nigeria. He was included in the Brazil team for 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup and led Brazil&#x27;s attack alongside Ronaldinho in the absence of Ronaldo. He appeared in all three matches and scored two goals as Brazil was eliminated in the group stage. He missed the 2004 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament due to injury.

The following year, he was included in the Brazil national team for 2004 Copa América. Brazil won the cup and Adriano won the Golden Boot as the competition&#x27;s leading scorer with seven goals. In the final match against Argentina, Adriano dramatically scored the equalizer in the 93rd minute. The match went on to penalties and Brazil finally won 4–2, with Adriano scoring his penalty. After the match, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira singled out Adriano as a very important factor in winning the title.

In 2005, Adriano once again had an impressive tournament with Brazil, this time in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. Adriano was named Player of the Tournament and received the Golden Boot Award as the competition&#x27;s leading scorer with five goals. In the final, he steered Brazil to victory, scoring two goals in a 4–1 victory over Argentina.

Adriano was called up for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, forming part of Brazil&#x27;s highly publicized &quot;magic quartet&quot; of offensive players alongside Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaká. He scored his first goal on 18 June 2006 in a 2–0 win against Australia and his second in a 3–0 victory against Ghana. Despite his two goals, Adriano&#x27;s World Cup campaign was considered a disappointment, as he managed only five shots all tournament, while Brazil as a whole was unable to find the right mix between defence and attack, ultimately being eliminated in the quarter-finals by France.

After the disappointing World Cup, Adriano&#x27;s international career declined due to a series of poor club performances and personal problems. Adriano has featured once for Brazil under Dunga&#x27;s regime since the conclusion of the World Cup, as a halftime substitute during a 2–0 friendly loss to Portugal on 6 February 2007. In 2008, Adriano finally regained his form during his stint at São Paulo FC and earned a recall to the national team. On 10 October 2008, Adriano scored his first international goal in two years in a World Cup qualifier against Venezuela. He was a regular member of Brazil squad during World Cup qualification, and was brought for the team&#x27;s last friendly prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup against Republic of Ireland. However, Adriano was one of the two players dropped from the final 23-men squad by coach Dunga, along with Carlos Eduardo (who had replaced an injured Elano against Ireland). The backup of injured Luís Fabiano on the Ireland game, Grafite, instead occupied Adriano&#x27;s place. Adriano was also left out of the backup player list.

==Style of play==
Adriano was a well-rounded, versatile, and modern striker, who combined pace and physicality with nimble footwork and excellent technical skills; due to his dominance, power, and skill, he was nicknamed &quot;L&#x27;Imperatore&quot; (&quot;The Emperor&quot;) after the famous Roman Emperor Hadrian, during his time in Italy. Adriano was a left-footed player, who was gifted with excellent ball control, dribbling ability, and creativity. He was also a strong forward, with an eye for goal, and an immensely powerful striker of the ball with his left foot, as well as was an accurate free-kick taker; he was also effective in the air, and had the ability to link-up with his teammates and provide assists. Regarded as a highly promising player in his youth, Adriano&#x27;s qualities and playing style drew comparisons with that of compatriot Ronaldo, and he was even initially regarded as his potential successor in the media. Despite his natural talent, Adriano&#x27;s consistency, character, fitness, and work-rate were brought into question after the death of his father; moreover, his struggles with depression and alcoholism, combined with his hedonistic and turbulent lifestyle off the pitch, as well as his personal troubles, injury struggles, and lack of discipline in training, also contributed to his significant weight gain as his career progressed. Due to his inconsistency in later years, he was widely regarded in the media for failing to live up to his initial potential. As such, although he was considered one of the best players in the world at his peak, Adriano is also a record three–time winner of the Bidone d&#x27;Oro Award, a prize is given to the worst Serie A player during a particular season, which he won in 2006 and 2007 with Inter, and in 2010 with Roma.

==Personal life==
In November 2014, a judge in Rio de Janeiro cleared Adriano of charges of drug trafficking which had first been alleged in 2010, due to a lack of sufficient evidence.

His son, also named Adriano, is also a professional footballer.

On 31 October 2024, an online video that had gone viral showed Adriano heavily intoxicated and stumbling on the streets of one of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro. An accompanying article also mentioned his marital troubles (divorce after just 24 days of marriage). He admitted becoming an alcoholic after the death of his father.

<doc id="1142475" wikidata="Q1623285" url="?curid=1142475" title="Yard (land)">
<text>A yard is an area of land immediately adjacent to one or more buildings. It may be either enclosed or open. The word may come from the same linguistic root as the word &quot;garden&quot; and has many of the same meanings.

A number of derived words exist, usually tied to a particular usage or building type. Some may be archaic or in lesser use now. Examples of such words are: courtyard, barnyard, hopyard, graveyard, churchyard, brickyard, prison yard, railyard, junkyard, stableyard, and dooryard.

==Word origin==
One possible account of the origin is the Middle English &quot;yerd&quot;, going back to Old English &quot;geard&quot; &quot;fence, enclosure, dwelling, home, district, country,&quot; going back to Germanic *&quot;garđa&quot;- (whence also Old Saxon &quot;gard&quot; &quot;garden, (compare the French&quot;jardin&quot;) dwelling, world,&quot; Middle Dutch &quot;gaert&quot; &quot;garden, yard,&quot; Old High German &quot;gart&quot; &quot;enclosure, circle, enclosed piece of property,&quot; Old Norse &quot;garðr&quot; &quot;enclosure, courtyard,&quot; Gothic &quot;gards&quot; (i-stem) &quot;house, household, courtyard&quot;; from an n-stem *&quot;garđan&quot;-: Old Frisian &quot;garda&quot; &quot;family property, courtyard,&quot; Old Saxon gardo &quot;garden,&quot; Old High German garto), perhaps (if from *ghortós) going back to Indo-European *&quot;ghortos&quot; &quot;enclosure,&quot; whence also Old Irish &quot;gort&quot; &quot;arable or pasture field,&quot; Welsh &quot;garth&quot; &quot;field, enclosure, fold,&quot; Breton garz &quot;hedge,&quot; Latin &quot;hortus&quot; &quot;garden,&quot; Greek &quot;chórtos&quot; &quot;farm-yard&quot;, &quot;feeding-place&quot;, &quot;fodder&quot;, (from which &quot;hay&quot; originally as grown in an enclosed field). &quot;Girdle,&quot; and &quot;court&quot; may be other related words from the same root.

In areas where farming is an important part of life, a yard is also a piece of enclosed land for farm animals or other agricultural purposes, often referred to as a cattleyard, sheepyard, stockyard, etc. In Australia, portable or mobile yards are sets of transportable steel panels used to build temporary stockyards.

==Application of the term ==

In North America and Australasia today, a yard can be any part of a property surrounding or associated with a house or other residential structure, usually (although not necessarily) separate from a garden (where plant maintenance is more formalized). A yard will typically consist mostly of lawn or play area. The yard in front of a house is referred to as a front yard, the area at the rear is known as a backyard. Backyards are generally more private and are thus a more common location for recreation. Yard size varies with population density. In urban centers, many houses have very small or even no yards at all. In the suburbs, yards are generally much larger and have room for such amenities as a patio, a playplace for children, or a swimming pool.

In British English, these areas would usually be described as a &quot;garden&quot;, similarly subdivided into a &quot;front garden&quot; and a &quot;back garden&quot;. The term yard is reserved for a hard surfaced area usually enclosed or at least with limited access. In modern Britain, the term yard is also used for land adjacent to or amongst workplace buildings or for commercial premises, for example timberyard, boatyard or dockyard.

In North America, the term &quot;garden&quot; refers only to the area that contains plots of vegetables, herbs, flowers, and/or ornamental plants; and the term &quot;yard&quot; does not refer to the &quot;garden&quot;, although the flower garden or vegetable garden may be within the yard.

<text>A backyard, or back yard (known in the United Kingdom as a back garden or just [[garden]]), is a yard at the back of a house, common in suburban developments in the Western world.

It is typically residential garden located at the rear of a property, on the other side of the house from the front yard. While Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, the &quot;garden&quot; (which etymologically may imply a shorthand of botanical garden) may use plants sparsely or not at all. Hence, the terms &quot;yard&quot; and &quot;garden&quot; are for the context of this article interchangeable in most cases.

== History ==
=== United Kingdom ===
In English suburban and gardening culture, back gardens have a special place. In Britain there are over 10 million back gardens. British planning require minimum distances between the rear faces of adjacent dwellings and so there is usually space for a back garden of some sort. In other countries, such as Australia, this does not apply and preference for buildings with a large footprint has tended to squeeze out the space at the rear.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, until the mid-20th century, the back yard of a property would traditionally contain a fowl run, outhouse (&quot;dunny&quot;), vegetable patch, and woodheap. More recently, these have been replaced by outdoor entertainments such as a barbecue and swimming pool. But, since the 1990s, the trend in Australian suburban development has been for back yards to disappear as the dwellings now occupy almost all of the building plot.

In higher latitudes, it is economical in low land value regions to use open land surrounding a house for vegetable gardening during summers and allow sunlight to enter house windows from a low horizon angle during winters. As land value increases, houses are built nearer to each other. In order to preserve some of the open land, house owners may choose to allow construction on the side land of their houses, but not build in front of or behind their house in order to preserve some remnants of open surrounding land. The back area is known as the backyard or back garden.

==Overview==
A back garden arises when the main building divides the surrounding gardens into two. This happens especially in the high density housing of British cities and towns. A semi-detached house typical of the British suburbs of the 20th century will have front gardens which face the road and provide access. The back gardens in such cases will be more secluded and access will typically be via the dwelling or by a path around the side. A front garden is a formal and semi-public space and so subject to the constraints of convention and law. However, the back garden is more private and casual, and so can be put to more purposes.

If the housing is terraced, then no side path is possible and access may be provided by an alley which runs behind the rear of the terrace. While buildings opening directly onto a street may not have a front garden, most will have some space at the back, however small; the exception being back-to-back houses found in northern industrial towns in England such as Leeds, but now mostly demolished. A private back yard with a &quot;privy&quot; (toilet) was a defining feature of the byelaw terraced house, a type of dwelling built to comply with the Public Health Act 1875.

==Usage==
Because of weather constraints, it is usual to use a garden more in the summer than in the winter, although some usages are traditional, such as for a bonfire on Bonfire Night, 5 November. Similarly, daytime usage is more common than nighttime.
Functionally, it may be used for:

* Growing food
* Playing games
* Relaxing and sunbathing
* Raising plants
* Housing pets
* Drying clothes
* Making a compost heap
* Hobbies
* Locating a greenhouse, conservatory, shed, workshop, outhouse, or garage (if access to a road is possible)
* Partying
* Wildlife refuge 
* Safe area for children
* Location of an air raid shelter such as the Anderson shelter of World War II

In fact, its functional and recreational use is so varied, that it cannot be easily categorised. Many of the freedoms of the use of the back garden come from the restrictions, social or legal of what are not done in the front.

Usually, clothes are not dried, vegetables are not grown, and sunbathing is not carried out in a front garden. All these can happen in the privacy of the back garden.

Traditionally, people treat a back garden as private to themselves, and not those they are neighbours to. The social etiquette of how one can greet and interact one&#x27;s neighbours may be complex and defined by many informal social rules.

In some areas, talking to one&#x27;s neighbours over the back wall (the side wall following the property boundary line) is usual, and is a welcome form of neighbourliness, while in other places it is not.

Depending on the size of the backyard, it may have any number of items (or none), such as:

<text>Hillclimbing is a problem faced by railway systems when a load must be carried up an incline. While railways have a great ability to haul very heavy loads, this is only possible when the tracks are fairly level. As soon as the gradients increase, the tonnage that can be hauled is greatly diminished.

== History ==
Early tramways and railways were laid out with very gentle grades because locomotive and horse haulage were so low in tractive effort. The only exception would be with a line that was downhill all the way for loaded traffic. Brakes were very primitive at this early stage.

Where a railway has to cross a range of mountains, it is important to lower the summit as much as possible, as this reduces the steepness of the gradients on either side. This can be done with a summit tunnel or a deep summit cutting.

A summit tunnel can lower the summit even more, and steeper hills result in shorter tunnels. Also, tunnels cost the same no matter how much overburden there is, while cuttings tend to increase in cost with the square of the overburden.

Care had to be taken with summit tunnels in the early days of steam with designs that suffered from problems with smoke and slippery rail.

== Ruling gradient ==

The ruling gradient of a section of railway line between two major stations is the gradient of the steepest stretch. The ruling gradient governs the tonnage of the load that the locomotive can haul reliably.

== Techniques to overcome steep hills ==
Some of the techniques that can be used to overcome steep hills are:
===Railway layout to reduce gradient===
* Compensation for curvature: the gradient is slightly eased on sharpest curves so that the tractive effort to pull the train is uniform.
* Horseshoe curves
* Spirals
* Zig zags
*A descending &quot;momentum gradient&quot; on the approach to a hill allows a train to increase speed before a climb.

===Track type===
* Rail surface treatment
* Fell mountain railway system
* Hanscotte centre-rail system
* Rack railway
* Elevators, cable railways, or funicular railways driven by stationary engines (cable haulage up and down inclines)

===Motive power===
* Using a booster engine, though this is usually limited to starting the heavy train
* Using two-in-one articulated locomotives such as the Fairlie, Garratt or Mallet locomotive
* Replacing the engine with a more powerful heavier engine for the duration of the steep grade
* Attaching additional banking engine(s)
* Using multiple units to divide the load on tractive wheels
* Geared steam locomotives such as a Shay locomotive
* Atmospheric railway
===Modifying the load===
* Dividing the load or splitting the train, which requires a siding at the summit

<text>Harold Blair (13 September 1924 – 21 May 1976) was an Australian tenor and Aboriginal activist. He has been called the &quot;last great Australian tenor of the concert hall era&quot;.

== Early life ==
Blair was born at the Barambah Aboriginal Reserve at Cherbourg, from Murgon in Queensland, on 13 September 1924. His mother was Esther Quinn, a teenage Aboriginal woman. His surname, Blair, came from the family that had &quot;adopted&quot; his mother. He and his mother then went to the Salvation Army Purga Mission near Ipswich. His mother entered domestic service, leaving Harold, then aged two, at the mission, where he received an elementary education. Blair left school at age 16, gaining employment as a farm labourer.

At the age of 17, he was working as a tractor driver at the Fairymead Sugar Mill. Communist trade union organiser Harry Green of Ipswich heard him singing and encouraged him to make it his career. In 1944 he joined professional artists raising money for charitable and patriotic causes.
In March 1945 he entered a radio talent quest in Brisbane and attracted a record number of listeners&#x27; votes.
The Queensland state government offered sponsorship for his further musical training, but was not taken up.
A group of trade unionists, academics and musicians formed a trust to sponsor his career.
Others credit Marjorie Lawrence for encouraging him, and an unnamed medical practitioner as a major sponsor.
The fund was managed by a Brisbane committee, under secretary Harry Green, president Professor J. V. Duhig, and whose members included Martin Healy (secretary of the Queensland T. and L. Council) and Dr Dalley-Scarlett. He boarded at John and Gwen Lloyd&#x27;s (Gwenoldyn Kent Hughes) house in Melbourne while he attended the Melba Conservatorium. 

== Singing career ==
He entered the Melba Conservatorium in Melbourne in 1945 and earned a Diploma of Music with honours in 1949. In 1950, Blair was invited to study in the United States by the noted African-American singer Todd Duncan. Blair studied at the Juilliard School, New York. While in New York he sang in a church in Harlem, and entered into their community life.

In 1951, the Australian Broadcasting Commission offered Blair a three-year singing contract, commencing with an extensive tour to celebrate 50 years of Federation. At least one critic disapproved of the ABC&#x27;s lionizing an unproven performer, but Henri Penn, his accompanist throughout the tour, was generally praised.
His repertoire consisted largely of European classical pieces in their original tongue — German &quot;lieder&quot;, Italian opera, and French art songs, as well as works in English by Handel and Southern spirituals. He also introduced traditional Aboriginal songs — &quot;Nananala Kututja&quot; (&quot;O God, Stay With Us Always&quot;), &quot;Maranoa Lullaby&quot; (arranged by Dr. H. O. Lethbridge, of Narrandera and Arthur S. Leam of Wagga), &quot;Jabin Jabin&quot; and other traditional songs, but admitted he most enjoyed singing &quot;Aba Daba Honeymoon&quot; with his wife Dorothy.

He cancelled his 41st concert in the series, at City Hall, Brisbane, due to a heavy cold but, though suffering laryngitis, gave a good concert at Maryborough three weeks later. He then returned to Brisbane, but was not in good voice. and gave up public appearances, at least temporarily, to concentrate on studying.

Having broken the contract, he was prohibited from singing professionally for three years. Discouraged, Blair sought other work including working for a hardware store. 
He expressed an interest in education and was taken on as a teacher at Ringwood Technical School. He later became a teacher at the Conservatorium in Melbourne, and served on the Aboriginal Arts Board.

Coincident with the ABC&#x27;s 1951 tour was the variety spectacular &quot;Out of the Dark – An Aboriginal Moomba&quot;, celebrating Victoria&#x27;s 100-year jubilee, in which Blair, as well as Doug Nicholls, Bill Onus, and Georgia Lee participated. This show, directed by Irene Mitchell, toured much of country Victoria to good reviews.

== Aboriginal activism ==
Blair continued to act for Aboriginal rights all his life. He joined the Aborigines Advancement League in its early days and later the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Watching an Aboriginal marching girls group at Moomba in 1962 led Blair to establish the Aboriginal Children&#x27;s Holiday Project, and he was an early member of the Aborigines Welfare Board in Victoria. In 1963 he stood as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party for the seat of Mentone in the Victorian Parliament against Edward Meagher, the then Transport Minister and chairman of the Aboriginal Welfare Board.

== Personal life ==
Blair married a fellow conservatorium singing student, Dorothy Eden, on 30 July 1949, and had two children, Nerida and Warren. The marriage encountered some hostility at the time, as it involved the marriage of an Aboriginal man to a European woman. He is survived by three grandchildren.

He had twin half-sisters, Joy and June Thompson (born around 1936), with whom he remained in contact.

Blair&#x27;s favourite sport was Australian rules football.

== Honours and recognition ==
Blair was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the Australia Day Honours of 1976.

Blair was honoured on This Is Your life, aired Apr 29, 1976

The Australian Electoral Division of Blair in Queensland, created in 1998, is named after him.

In 2012, the Melba Opera Trust established the Harold Blair Opera Scholarship, to provide young Indigenous singers with artistic development, mentoring and performance opportunities. The scholarship was won by Tiriki Onus in 2012 and 2013.

In 2013, Blair was inducted into the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll.

He died in Melbourne&#x27;s Mercy Hospital on 21 May 1976, aged 51. An obituary opined that his most enduring legacy would be his Aboriginal children&#x27;s holiday project, which saw thousands of children boarding in private homes in Melbourne and Sydney during school holidays.

Harold Blair is buried at The Purga Aboriginal Cemetery, with his grave located directly beneath the &quot;Purga Aboriginal Cemetry Reserve&quot; sign

<text>Injil (, alternative spellings: &quot;Ingil&quot; or &quot;Injeel&quot;) is the Arabic name for the Gospel of Jesus (Isa). This &quot;Injil&quot; is described by the Qur&#x27;an as one of the four Islamic holy books which was revealed by Allah, the others being the Zabur (traditionally understood as being the Psalms), the Tawrat (the Torah), and the Qur&#x27;an itself. The word &quot;Injil&quot; is also used in the Qur’an, the &quot;hadith&quot; and early Muslim documents to refer to both a book and revelations made by God to Jesus.

==Etymology==
The Arabic word &quot;Injil&quot; () as found in Islamic texts, now used also by non-Arab Muslims and non-Muslim Arabs, comes from the found in the &quot;Peshitta&quot;, the Syriac translation of the Bible. This, in turn, derives from of the New Testament, where it means “good news” (from Old English &quot;gōdspel&quot;; Modern English &quot;gospel&quot;, or &quot;evangel&quot; as an archaism; cf. e.g. Spanish &quot;evangelio&quot;). The word &quot;Injil&quot; occurs twelve times in the Quran.

==Identification==
Muslim scholars have rejected identifying the Injil with the New Testament Gospels and interpret Quran, sura 5 (Al-Ma&#x27;ida), ayah 46, 47a as God warning the Christians not to enforce the law contrary to the law sent by Allah: Some have suggested the &quot;Injil&quot; may be the Gospel of Barnabas or Gospel of Thomas. More commonly, Muslim scholars have argued that the &quot;Injil&quot; refers to a text now lost or hopelessly corrupted. For example, Abdullah Yusuf Ali wrote:

This claim however has been widely rejected by both Christian and secular scholars, since the Bible&#x27;s textual history is supported by a vast number of manuscripts, with thousand of manuscripts for the canonical gospels alone. There is overall consensus the gospels were written within the first century AD, compared to the Quran who was written only in the 7th century AD, much later. Meanwhile the tests mentioned by Muslims. e.g., the Gospel of Childhood or the Nativity, the Gospel of St. Barnabas, came at least a century after the canonical gospels.

==In Qur&#x27;anic exegesis==

The Islamic methodology of () refers to interpreting the Qur&#x27;an with/through the Bible. This approach adopts canonical Arabic versions of the Bible, including the Tawrat and the Injil, both to illuminate and to add exegetical depth to the reading of the Qur&#x27;an. Notable Muslim (commentators) of the Bible and Qur&#x27;an who weaved biblical texts together with Qur&#x27;anic ones include Abu al-Hakam Abd al-Salam bin al-Isbili of Al-Andalus and Burhan al-Din al-Biqa&#x27;i.

<text>African-American culture, also known as Black American culture or Black culture in American English, refers to the cultural expressions of African Americans, either as part of or distinct from mainstream American culture. African-American culture has been influential on American and global worldwide culture as a whole.

African American culture is not simply defined by race or historical struggle but is deeply rooted in shared practices, identity, and community. African American culture encompasses many aspects, including spiritual beliefs, social customs, lifestyles, and worldviews. When blended together these have allowed African Americans to create successes and excel in the areas of literature, media, cinema, music, architecture, art, politics, and business, as well as cuisine marriage, and family.

A relatively unknown aspect of African American culture is the significant impact it has had on both science and industry. &quot;Some elements of African American culture come from within the community, others from the interaction of African Americans with the wider diaspora of people of African origin&quot; displaced throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, and others still from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community.

In addition, African American culture is influenced by Indigenous African Culture, and Native American culture.

Before the Civil Rights Movement, religious and spiritual life dominated many aspects of African American culture, deeply influencing cultural expression. Since the Movement, which was a mere 60 years ago—effectively just two generations—African Americans have built on the foundation of resilience and advocacy established during that era. This legacy has catalyzed significant progress, enabling African Americans to achieve success across every field of American life.

African-Americans have faced racial biases throughout various periods since arriving in the United States. These systemic injustices have included, but are not limited to; enslavement, oppressive legislation like discriminatory Jim Crow laws, societal segregation, as well as overt denial of basic human Civil Rights. Racism has caused many African-Americans to be excluded from many aspects of American life during various points throughout American history and these experiences have profoundly influenced African-American culture, and how African Americans choose to interact with the broader American society.

==African-American cultural history==

African Americans are the result of an amalgamation of many different countries, cultures, tribes and religions during the 16th and 17th centuries, broken down, and rebuilt upon shared experiences and blended into one group on the North American continent during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and are now called African American.

Most African Americans are the descendants of enslaved people who lived within the boundaries of the present United States. In addition,  African Americans that are American Descendant of Slaves (ADOS) are primarily of West African and coastal Central African ancestry, with varying amounts of Western European and Native American ancestry.

Roughly one-in-five Black people in the U.S. are immigrants or children of Black immigrants. While some Black immigrants or their children may also come to identify with African Americans, Black immigrants to the U.S. are not part of the African American ethnic group. The majority of first-generation immigrants from Africa prefer to identify with their nation of origin. There is some recent research which shows that some Black immigrants to the US resist assimilation to reduce exposure to racial discrimination faced by native-born African Americans.

=== Shared history in the Americas ===
From the earliest days of American slavery in the 17th century, slave holders sought to exercise control over their people that were forced into slavery by attempting to strip them of their African culture. In the New World in general and in the United States in particular, the physical isolation and the societal marginalization of African enslaved people, and, later, the physical isolation and the societal marginalization of their free progeny facilitated the retention of significant elements of traditional culture among Africans. Slave holders deliberately tried to repress independent political or cultural organization in order to deal with the many slave rebellions or acts of resistance that took place in the United States, Brazil, Haiti, and the Dutch Guyanas.

African cultures, slavery, slave rebellions, and the civil rights movement have all shaped African-American religious, familial, political, and economic behaviors.

The rich tapestry of African traditions provided a foundation for the spiritual practices of enslaved individuals, blending ancestral beliefs with Christianity to create vibrant forms of worship. This cultural resilience was evident in slave rebellions, which not only challenged the institution of slavery but also fostered a sense of community and shared identity among African Americans. The civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice. This historical legacy has influenced contemporary African-American families, shaping their values, community structures, and approaches to political engagement. Economically, the enduring impacts of systemic inequality have led to both challenges and innovations within African-American communities, driving a commitment to empowerment and social change that echoes through generations. This is heavily evident in the cultural practices and traditions that are displayed in the present day community. Traditions like songs, dances, language, and more.

The imprint of Africa is evident in a myriad of ways: in politics, economics, language, music, hairstyles, fashion, dance, religion, cuisine, and worldview. Throughout all of this, African Americans have created their own culture and unique history in the United States.

In turn, African-American culture has had a pervasive and transformative impact on many elements of mainstream American culture. From inventors and scientists to media moguls and entertainers, African Americans have made significant contributions that have profoundly impacted daily American life. Their innovations, discoveries, and creative works have shaped various aspects of society, from technology and science to entertainment and media. Despite these substantial contributions, many people remain unaware of the extent to which African Americans have influenced and enriched everyday experiences in the United States.

This process of mutual creative exchange is called creolization. Over time, the culture of African slaves and their descendants has been ubiquitous in its impact on not only the dominant American culture, but on world culture as well.

===Oral tradition===

The holders of enslaved trapped people (slaves) limited or prohibited their education, the fear was that education might empower the people, and inspire or enable emancipatory ambitions. In the United States, the legislation that banned enslaved people from getting a formal education likely contributed to their maintenance of a strong oral tradition, a common feature of indigenous or native African culture. This prohibition remained in effect until the passage of the Reconstruction Acts in the late 1860s. Specifically, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Fourteenth Amendment (ratified in 1868) both helped lay the groundwork for broader educational opportunities by granting citizenship and equal protection under the law to African Americans, although they did not directly mandate school integration.

African-based oral traditions became the primary means of preserving history, mores, and other cultural information among the people. This was consistent with the &quot;griot&quot; practices of oral history in many native African culture and other cultures that did not rely on the written word. Many of these cultural elements have been passed from generation to generation through storytelling. The folktales provided African-Americans the opportunity to inspire and educate one another.

Examples of African-American folktales include trickster tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and heroic tales such as that of John Henry. The &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; stories by Joel Chandler Harris helped to bring African-American folk tales into mainstream adoption. Harris did not appreciate the complexity of the stories nor their potential for a lasting impact on society. Other narratives that appear as important, recurring motifs in African-American culture are the &quot;Signifying Monkey&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Shine&quot;, and the legend of Stagger Lee.

The legacy of the African-American oral tradition manifests in diverse forms. African-American preachers tend to perform rather than simply speak. The emotion of the subject is carried through the speaker&#x27;s tone, volume, and cadence, which tend to mirror the rising action, climax, and descending action of the sermon. The meaning of this manner of preaching is not easily understood by European Americans or others of non-African origin. Often song, dance, verse, and structured pauses are placed throughout the sermon. Call and response is another element of the African-American oral tradition. It manifests in worship in what is commonly referred to as the &quot;amen corner&quot;. In direct contrast to the tradition present in American and European cultures, it is an acceptable and common audience reaction to interrupt and affirm the speaker. This pattern of interaction is also in evidence in music, particularly in blues and jazz forms. Hyperbolic and provocative, even incendiary, rhetoric is another aspect of African-American oral tradition often evident in the pulpit in a tradition sometimes referred to as &quot;prophetic speech&quot;.

Modernity and migration of African-American communities to the North has had a history of placing strain on the retention of African-American cultural practices and traditions. The urban and radically different spaces in which black culture was being produced raised fears in anthropologists and sociologists that the southern African-American folk aspect of black popular culture were at risk of being lost within history. The study over the fear of losing black popular cultural roots from the South has been a topic of interest to many anthropologists, who among them include Zora Neale Hurston. Through her extensive studies of Southern folklore and cultural practices, Hurston has claimed that the popular Southern folklore traditions and practices are not dying off, instead they are evolving, developing, and re-creating themselves in different regions.

Other aspects of African-American oral tradition include the dozens, signifying, trash talk, rhyming, semantic inversion and word play, many of which have found their way into mainstream American popular culture and become international phenomena. During slavery, African Americans adapted these linguistic traditions as a form of covert resistance and survival. Enslaved people developed signifying as a way to communicate subtly under the watchful eyes of slaveholders, often using coded language, humor, and indirection to express dissent, critique the powerful, or convey hidden meanings without being detected.

Spoken-word poetry is another example of how the African-American oral tradition has influenced modern popular culture. Spoken-word artists employ the same techniques as African-American preachers including movement, rhythm, and audience participation. Rap music from the 1980s and beyond has been cited as an extension of African oral culture.

===Harlem Renaissance===

The first major public recognition of African-American culture occurred during the Harlem Renaissance pioneered by Alain Locke. In the 1920s and 1930s, African-American music, literature, and art gained wide notice. Authors such as Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and poets such as Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, and Countee Cullen wrote works describing the African-American experience. Jazz, swing, blues and other musical forms entered American popular music. African-American artists such as William H. Johnson, Aaron Douglas, and Palmer Hayden created unique works of art featuring African Americans.

The Harlem Renaissance was also a time of increased political involvement for African Americans. Among the notable African-American political movements founded in the early 20th century are the Universal Negro Improvement Association and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The Nation of Islam, a notable quasi-Islamic religious movement, also began in the early 1930s.

===African-American cultural movement===

The Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s followed in the wake of the non-violent Civil Rights Movement. The movement promoted racial pride and ethnic cohesion in contrast to the focus on integration of the Civil Rights Movement, and adopted a more militant posture in the face of racism. It also inspired a new renaissance in African-American literary and artistic expression generally referred to as the African-American or &quot;Black Arts Movement&quot;.

The works of popular recording artists such as Nina Simone (&quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot;) and The Impressions (&quot;Keep On Pushing&quot;), as well as the poetry, fine arts, and literature of the time, shaped and reflected the growing racial and political consciousness. Among the most prominent writers of the African-American Arts Movement were poet Nikki Giovanni; poet and publisher Don L. Lee, who later became known as Haki Madhubuti; poet and playwright Leroi Jones, later known as Amiri Baraka; and Sonia Sanchez. Other influential writers were Ed Bullins, Dudley Randall, Mari Evans, June Jordan, Larry Neal, and Ahmos Zu-Bolton.

During the African American cultural Movement, Melvin Charles and Gleason T Jackson created the Black American Heritage Flag (also known as the African American Heritage Flag) in 1967 for Black Americans. It is used today as an ethnic flag that represents the African American people.

Another major aspect of the African-American Arts Movement was the infusion of the African aesthetic, a return to a collective cultural sensibility and ethnic pride that was much in evidence during the Harlem Renaissance and in the celebration of &quot;Négritude&quot; among the artistic and literary circles in the US, Caribbean, and the African continent nearly four decades earlier: the idea that &quot;black is beautiful&quot;. During this time, there was a resurgence of interest in elements of African culture within African-American culture that had been suppressed or devalued to conform to Eurocentric America. Natural hairstyles, such as the afro, and African clothing, such as the dashiki, gained popularity. More importantly, the African-American aesthetic encouraged personal pride and political awareness among African Americans.

==Music==

Music in African-American culture extends far beyond the realms of performance and consumption; it is deeply rooted in community participation and interaction. The act of musicking—actively engaging with music in various forms—includes singing together in churches, participating in call-and-response patterns, dancing, and even informal music-making in social settings. In African-American churches, gospel music serves not only as a form of worship but also as a collective spiritual experience. Congregants engage fully in musicking, responding to the choir with shouts of affirmation, clapping, and even dancing, which fosters a powerful sense of unity and shared purpose.

The tradition of call-and-response, which originated in African and African-American spirituals, is a key feature in many genres, including gospel, jazz, and hip-hop. This dynamic interaction between performer and audience blurs the line between the two, inviting the entire community to participate. In jazz, for instance, improvisation between musicians can be viewed as a form of musicking where the performers engage in a musical dialogue that often involves audience feedback and interaction. Similarly, early hip-hop culture emphasized the participatory nature of musicking, with community members engaging through freestyle rap battles, breakdancing, and DJing. These musicking practices highlight the active role of music as a social connector, shaping cultural identity and fostering communal bonds.

This dynamic interaction with music reflects not only the rich musical heritage of African-American communities but also the centrality of music in expressing cultural values, resistance, and resilience.

African-American music is rooted in the typically polyrhythmic music of the ethnic groups of Africa, specifically those in the Western, Sahelean, and Central and Southern regions. African oral traditions, nurtured in slavery, encouraged the use of music to pass on history, teach lessons, ease suffering, and relay messages. The African pedigree of African-American music is evident in some common elements: call and response, syncopation, percussion, improvisation, swung notes, blue notes, the use of falsetto, melisma, and complex multi-part harmony. During slavery, Africans in America blended traditional European hymns with African elements to create spirituals. The banjo was the first African derived instrument to be played and built in the United States. Slaveholders discovered African-American slaves used drums to communicate.

As far back as the 1700s, after drums were outlawed after the Stono Rebellion in South Carolina, African Americans created hamboning, patting their bodies in order to make their music.

Many African Americans sing &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; in addition to the American national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, or in lieu of it. Written by James Weldon Johnson and John Rosamond Johnson in 1900 to be performed for the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the song was, and continues to be, a popular way for African Americans to recall past struggles and express ethnic solidarity, faith, and hope for the future. The song was adopted as the &quot;Negro National Anthem&quot; by the NAACP in 1919. Many African-American children are taught the song at school, church or by their families. &quot;Lift Ev&#x27;ry Voice and Sing&quot; traditionally is sung immediately following, or instead of, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at events hosted by African-American churches, schools, and other organizations.

In the 19th century, as the result of the blackface minstrel show, African-American music entered mainstream American society. By the early 20th century, several musical forms with origins in the African-American community had transformed American popular music. Aided by the technological innovations of radio and phonograph records, ragtime, jazz, blues, and swing also became popular overseas, and the 1920s became known as the Jazz Age. The early 20th century also saw the creation of the first African-American Broadway shows, films such as King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;, and operas such as George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

===Contemporary===
The African-American Cultural Movement of the 1960s and 1970s fueled the growth of funk, soul, and later hip hop forms with sub-genres of hip hop to include; rap, hip house, new jack swing, and go-go. House music was created in black communities in Chicago in the 1980s. Hip hop and contemporary R&amp;B would become a multicultural movement, however, it still remained important to many African Americans.

In the 21st century, African-American music has achieved unprecedented levels of mainstream acceptance and influence in American popular music. This is evident from its dominant performance on the Billboard charts, where genres such as hip-hop and R&amp;B, deeply rooted in African-American culture, have surpassed even pop in terms of streaming and sales (Nielsen, 2018). The impact of African-American artists on contemporary music, fashion, and cultural trends is significant, with figures like Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake shaping the industry and reflecting its broad appeal across diverse audiences (Billboard, 2020).

Furthermore, the integration of African-American musical styles into mainstream media has been highlighted by high-profile collaborations and genre-blending successes, such as Lil Nas X’s &quot;Old Town Road,&quot; which achieved historic chart success by merging hip-hop with country music (Billboard, 2019). Streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music also show the substantial engagement and commercial success of African-American music across various demographics, underscoring its wide-reaching influence and acceptance in the modern music landscape (Rolling Stone, 2021).

In addition to continuing to develop newer musical forms, modern artists have also started a rebirth of older genres in the form of genres such as neo soul and modern funk-inspired groups.

As of November 2018, the leading music genre listened to by African Americans is R&amp;B Rhythm &amp; Blues (62%), Hip Hop (39%), Gospel (26%) Rap (21%) Soul/Funk(19%), Jazz(18%)

==The arts==
===Dance===
African-American dance, like other aspects of African-American culture, finds its earliest roots in the dances of the hundreds of African ethnic groups that made up the enslaved African population in the Americas as well as in traditional folk dances from Europe. Dance in the African tradition, and thus in the tradition of slaves, was a part of both everyday life and special occasions. Many of these traditions such as get down, ring shouts, Akan Line Dancing and other elements of African body language survive as elements of modern dance.

In the 19th century, African-American dance began to appear in minstrel shows. These shows often presented African Americans as caricatures for ridicule to large audiences. The first African-American dance to become popular with white dancers was the cakewalk in 1891. Later dances to follow in this tradition include the Charleston, the Lindy Hop, the Jitterbug and the swing.

During the Harlem Renaissance, African-American Broadway shows such as &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; helped to establish and legitimize African-American dancers. African-American dance forms such as tap, a combination of African and European influences, gained widespread popularity thanks to dancers such as Bill Robinson and were used by leading white choreographers, who often hired African-American dancers.

Contemporary African-American dance is descended from these earlier forms and also draws influence from African and Caribbean dance forms. Groups such as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater have continued to contribute to the growth of this form. Modern popular dance in America is also greatly influenced by African-American dance. American popular dance has also drawn many influences from African-American dance most notably in the hip-hop genre.

One of the uniquely African-American forms of dancing, turfing, emerged from social and political movements in the East Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area. Turfing is a hood dance and a response to the loss of African-American lives, police brutality, and race relations in Oakland, California. The dance is an expression of Blackness, and one that integrates concepts of solidarity, social support, peace, and the discourse of the state of black people in our current social structures.

Twerking is an African-American dance similar to dances from Africa in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Senegal, Somalia and the Congo.

===Art===
From its early origins in slave communities, through the end of the 20th century, African-American art has made a vital contribution to the art of the United States. During the period between the 17th century and the early 19th century, art took the form of small drums, quilts, wrought-iron figures, and ceramic vessels in the southern United States. These artifacts have similarities with comparable crafts in West and Central Africa. In contrast, African-American artisans like the New England–based engraver Scipio Moorhead and the Baltimore portrait painter Joshua Johnson created art that was conceived in a thoroughly western European fashion.

During the 19th century, Harriet Powers made quilts in rural Georgia, United States that are now considered among the finest examples of 19th-century Southern quilting. Later in the 20th century, the women of Gee&#x27;s Bend developed a distinctive, bold, and sophisticated quilting style based on traditional African-American quilts with a geometric simplicity that developed separately but was like that of Amish quilts and modern art.

After the American Civil War, museums and galleries began more frequently to display the work of African-American artists. Cultural expression in mainstream venues was still limited by the dominant European aesthetic and by racial prejudice. To increase the visibility of their work, many African-American artists traveled to Europe where they had greater freedom. It was not until the Harlem Renaissance that more European Americans began to pay attention to African-American art in America.

During the 1920s, artists such as Richmond Barthé, Aaron Douglas, Augusta Savage, and photographer James Van Der Zee became well known for their work. During the Great Depression, new opportunities arose for these and other African-American artists under the WPA. In later years, other programs and institutions, such as the New York City-based Harmon Foundation, helped to foster African-American artistic talent. Augusta Savage, Elizabeth Catlett, Lois Mailou Jones, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, and others exhibited in museums and juried art shows, and built reputations and followings for themselves.

In the 1950s and 1960s, there were very few widely accepted African-American artists. Despite this, The Highwaymen, a loose association of 27 African-American artists from Ft. Pierce, Florida, created idyllic, quickly realized images of the Florida landscape and peddled some 50,000 of them from the trunks of their cars. They sold their art directly to the public rather than through galleries and art agents, thus receiving the name &quot;The Highwaymen&quot;. Rediscovered in the mid-1990s, today they are recognized as an important part of American folk history. Their artwork is widely collected by enthusiasts and original pieces can easily fetch thousands of dollars in auctions and sales.

The Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s was another period of resurgent interest in African-American art. During this period, several African-American artists gained national prominence, among them Lou Stovall, Ed Love, Charles White, and Jeff Donaldson. Donaldson and a group of African-American artists formed the Afrocentric collective AfriCOBRA, which remains in existence today. The sculptor Martin Puryear, whose work has been acclaimed for years, was being honored with a 30-year retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in November 2007. Notable contemporary African-American artists include Willie Cole, David Hammons, Eugene J. Martin, Mose Tolliver, Reynold Ruffins, the late William Tolliver, and Kara Walker.

===Ceramics===
In Charleston, South Carolina, thirteen colonoware from the 18th century were found with folded strip roulette decorations. From the time of colonial America until the 19th century in the United States, African-Americans and their enslaved African ancestors, as well as Native Americans who were enslaved and not enslaved, were creating colonoware of this pottery style. Roulette decorated pottery likely originated in West Africa and in the northern region of Central Africa amid 2000 BCE. The longstanding pottery tradition, from which for the Charleston colonoware derives, likely began its initial development between 800 BCE and 400 BCE in Mali; thereafter, the pottery tradition expanded around 900 CE into the Lake Chad basin, into the southeastern region of Mauritania by 1200 CE, and, by the 19th century CE, expanded southward. More specifically, the pottery style for the Charleston colonoware may have been created by 18th century peoples (e.g., Kanuri people, Hausa people in Kano) of the Kanem–Bornu Empire. Within a broader context, following the 17th century enslavement of western Africans for the farming of rice in South Carolina, the Charleston colonoware may be understood as Africanisms from West/Central Africa, which endured the Middle Passage, and became transplanted into the local culture of colonial-era Lowcountry, South Carolina.

Symbolisms from Africa may have served as identity markers for enslaved African-American creators of stoneware. For example, David Drake&#x27;s signature marks (e.g., an &quot;X&quot;, a slash) and well as Landrum crosses, which were developed by enslaved African Americans and appear similar to Kongo cosmograms, are such examples from Edgefield County, South Carolina.

===Literature===

African-American literature has its roots in the oral traditions of African slaves in America. The slaves used stories and fables in much the same way as they used music. These stories influenced the earliest African-American writers and poets in the 18th century such as Phillis Wheatley and Olaudah Equiano. These authors reached early high points by telling slave narratives.

During the early 20th century Harlem Renaissance, numerous authors and poets, such as Langston Hughes, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Booker T. Washington, grappled with how to respond to discrimination in America. Authors during the Civil Rights Movement, such as Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about issues of racial segregation, oppression, and other aspects of African-American life. This tradition continues today with authors who have been accepted as an integral part of American literature, with works such as &quot;&quot; by Alex Haley, &quot;The Color Purple&quot; by Alice Walker, &quot;Beloved&quot; by Nobel Prize-winning Toni Morrison, and fiction works by Octavia Butler and Walter Mosley. Such works have achieved both best-selling and/or award-winning status.

===Cinema===
African-American films typically feature an African-American cast and are targeted at an African-American audience. More recently, Black films feature multicultural casts, and are aimed at multicultural audiences, even if American Blackness is essential to the storyline.

== Sports and recreation ==
===Games===
Card games are traditionally enjoyed by African Americans at familial gatherings. Originating Black card games include: Bid whist, Spades, Tonk, Pitty-Pat, and Rummy. &quot;Talkin&#x27; the board&quot; is not allowed in any game.

Hand games that trickled from Africa are also prominent in Black American culture. Double This, Double That, Mama Mama Can&#x27;t You See, Slide Baby, Miss Mary Mack, Down, Down Baby, Rockin&#x27; Robin (Tweet), Down by the Banks of the Hanky Panky, and Shame, Shame, Shame are a handful of kinesthetic games enjoyed by— predominantly— young Black girls.

==Museums==
The African American Museum Movement emerged during the 1950s and 1960s to preserve the heritage of the African-American experience and to ensure its proper interpretation in American history. Museums devoted to African-American history are found in many African-American neighborhoods. Institutions such as the African American Museum and Library at Oakland, The African American Museum in Cleveland and the Natchez Museum of African American History and Culture were created by African Americans to teach and investigate cultural history that, until recent decades, was primarily preserved through oral traditions.

Other prominent African-American museums include Chicago&#x27;s DuSable Museum of African American History, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, established in 2003 as part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

==Language==

When immigrant groups come to a new country, they often bring their native language with them and continue using it, at least initially, within their community. Over time, their language may blend with the dominant language of the new country, creating bilingualism or hybrid forms of words and phrases, however their language remains the root or starting point of the hybrid language they speak. Over time as the group of immigrants immerse themselves into the dominant culture, the more they use the dominant culture language and abandon less used words and phrases in their native tongue.

The history of the involuntary manner in which African Americans arrived in the United States, coupled with 100 years of forced segregation from the dominant culture allowed for a protracted period where language was being formed and shaped outside the traditional patterns. Most enslaved Africans brought to the Americas came from the West African coast. The languages of this region, such as those from the Niger-Congo family, had a significant influence. Some specific examples include the Wolof, Yoruba, Igbo and Mandé languages. There was also a large contingent from Central Africa, especially from regions where Bantu languages were spoken, such as Kongo (Kikongo), Mbundu and Swahili.

The native speakers of these and other languages were forced to quickly find a way to agree upon new words and phrases as a matter of survival, while also learning and integrating various dialects of American English which varied by region. Over time a divergent form of English emerged. Over the 246 years of chattel slavery in the southern US and societal segregation in the northern states, varied forms of English took root within the African American culture. An additional century of forced segregation and Jim Crow between 1865 and 1965 extended the period when African Americans, still not fully immersed in the broader society, did not experience the traditional process of adopting the dominant society&#x27;s language.

Generations of hardships created by the compounded institutions of slavery imposed upon the African-American community prevented the majority of them from learning to read or write English, despite this, enslaved Africans continued to carry their language systems and culture, creating distinct language patterns. Filtering the English they heard through their language systems and culture.

While traditionally understood to be generally factual that European owners of enslaved Africans often intentionally mixed Africans who spoke different languages to discourage communication in any language other than English, the truth is that Africans were strategically placed in certain types of settings. West Africans were primarily (not exclusively) placed in non-field work in the upper southern colonies and West Central/Central Africans were primarily (not exclusively) placed in field based work in the lower southern colonies.

Africans in primarily non-field work typically had extensive interaction with Europeans in the early period, with cultural influence being bi-directional. Colonies typically preferred certain African ethnic groups, some very selective (South Carolina for example), others a bit more loose but still maintained a level of preference (Virginia for example). West Central and Central Africans brought with them a homogenous culture that superseded West African culture early on in establishing African-American culture, at a later point in history, West African influence displays itself in African-American culture.

Interaction between West Africans and West Central/Central Africans did occur, creating a lingua franca, however the culture of African Americans was heavily affected by the homogeneity and relatively isolated Bantu imported population. Later influence from West Africa presents itself in African-American culture. African-American speech however is heavily based (but not exclusively, includes West Africa to some extent) in Bantu culture, as such, it is responsible for African Americans&#x27; language patterns, combining an African substrate with the topical usage of primarily non-African words.

African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is touted to be a variety (dialect, ethnolect, and sociolect) of the American English language; however, mainstream non-AAL/V linguists have traditionally and intentionally ignored or dismissed African language systems and culture, missing key associations and connections. AAVE has its roots in the historical experiences of African Americans and plays a crucial role in cultural identity and expression. It has also significantly influenced mainstream American English, particularly through music, literature, and media. Linguists and speakers of AAL (African American Language) have shown not only that the grammatical structure of AAL is Niger-Congo, but also that the cultural/relational patterns within the language that are of African origin characterize or color it.

There exists convergence and commonality with many languages; these elements don&#x27;t automatically indicate derivation. While AAVE is academically considered a legitimate dialect because of its logical structure, some of both whites and African Americans consider it slang or the result of a poor command of Standard American English, none of which is true; they are differences in languages. Many African Americans who were born outside the American South still speak with hints of AAVE or southern dialect. Inner-city African-American children who are isolated by speaking only AAVE sometimes have more difficulty with standardized testing and, after school, moving to the mainstream world for work. It is common for many speakers of AAVE to code switch between AAVE and Standard American English depending on the setting.

==Fashion and aesthetics==
===Attire===
The Black Arts Movement, a cultural explosion of the 1960s, saw the incorporation of surviving cultural dress with elements from modern fashion and West African traditional clothing to create a uniquely African-American traditional style. Kente cloth is the best known African textile. These colorful woven patterns, which exist in numerous varieties, were originally made by the Asante and Ewe peoples of Ghana and Togo. Kente fabric also appears in a number of Western style fashions ranging from casual T-shirts to formal bow ties and cummerbunds. Kente strips are often sewn into liturgical and academic robes or worn as stoles. Since the Black Arts Movement, traditional African clothing has been popular amongst African Americans for both formal and informal occasions. Other manifestations of traditional African dress in common evidence in African-American culture are vibrant colors, mud cloth, trade beads and the use of Adinkra motifs in jewelry and in couture and decorator fabrics.

Another common aspect of fashion in African-American culture involves the appropriate dress for worship in the Black church. It is expected in most churches that an individual present their best appearance for worship. African-American women in particular are known for wearing vibrant dresses and suits. An interpretation of a passage from the Christian Bible, &quot;every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head&quot;, has led to the tradition of wearing elaborate Sunday hats, sometimes known as &quot;crowns&quot;.

Hip hop fashion is popular with African Americans. Grillz were made popular by African-American rapper Nelly.
Sagging pants was a part of African-American culture. Air Jordan, a shoe brand named after former African-American basketball player Michael Jordan, is very popular among the African-American community.

African-American fashion designers include Sean Combs, Kimora Lee Simmons, Virgil Abloh and Kanye West.

===Hair===
Hair styling in African-American culture is greatly varied. African-American hair is typically composed of coiled curls, which range from tight to wavy. Many women choose to wear their hair in its natural state. Natural hair can be styled in a variety of ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go styles. It is a myth that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent because mainstream culture has, for decades, attempted to get African-American women to conform to its standard of beauty (i.e., straight hair). To that end, some women prefer straightening of the hair through the application of heat or chemical processes. Although this can be a matter of personal preference, the choice is often affected by straight hair being a beauty standard in the West and the fact that hair type can affect employment. However, more and more women are wearing their hair in its natural state and receiving positive feedback. Alternatively, the predominant and most socially acceptable practice for men is to leave one&#x27;s hair natural.

Often, as men age and begin to lose their hair, the hair is either closely cropped, or the head is shaved completely free of hair. However, since the 1960s, natural hairstyles, such as the afro, braids, waves, fades, and dreadlocks, have been growing in popularity. Despite their association with radical political movements and their vast difference from mainstream Western hairstyles, the styles have attained considerable, but certainly limited, social acceptance.

Maintaining facial hair is more prevalent among African-American men than in other male populations in the US. In fact, the soul patch is so named because African-American men, particularly jazz musicians, popularized the style. The preference for facial hair among African-American men is due partly to personal taste, but also because they are more prone than other ethnic groups to develop a condition known as &quot;pseudofolliculitis barbae&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;razor bumps&quot;, many prefer not to shave.

===Body image===
Eurocentric beauty standards have widely shaped image. In an effort to unlearn these sentiments rooted in colonialism and white supremacy, a movement has ensued that promotes natural Black beauty. There are also individuals and groups who are working towards raising the standing of the African aesthetic among African Americans and internationally as well. This includes efforts toward promoting models with clearly defined African features; the mainstreaming of natural hairstyles; and, in women, fuller, more voluptuous body types.
Non-Black Americans have sometimes appropriated different hair braiding techniques and other forms of African-American hair. Afro features are too often ridiculed to be subject to glamorization by the non-Afro people who appropriate them.

==Religion and spirituality==
While African Americans practice a number of religions, Black Protestant is by far the most prevalent (59%), followed by Evangelical Protestant (15%).

===Christianity===

The religious institutions of African-American Christians are commonly and collectively referred to as the black church. During the era of slavery, many slaves were stripped of their African belief systems and typically denied free religious practice, some forced to become Christians while others brought Christianity from Africa. However, slaves managed to hang on to some of their traditional African religious practices by integrating them into Christian worship during secret meetings. These practices, including dance, shouts, African rhythms, and enthusiastic singing, remain a large part of worship in the African-American church.

African-American churches taught the belief that all people were equal in God&#x27;s eyes, and they also believed that the doctrine of obedience to one&#x27;s master which was taught in white churches was hypocritical—yet they accepted and propagated internal hierarchies and supported the corporal punishment of children among other things. Slave and master teachings were taught out of context by slave masters through the use of a Slave Bible where slave holders would remove pages and whole books of biblical scriptures, such as Exodus and others, that were heavily against ill-treatment of slaves, or those who worked for you, against kidnapping and selling of people, and that they felt could cause a rebellion. Instead, the African-American church focused on the message of equality and hopes for a better future. Before and after emancipation, racial segregation in America prompted the development of organized African-American denominations. The first of these was the AME Church founded by Richard Allen in 1787.

After the Civil War, the merger of three smaller Baptist groups formed the National Baptist Convention. This organization is the largest African-American Christian Denomination and it is also the second largest Baptist denomination in the United States. An African-American church is not necessarily a separate denomination. Several predominantly African-American churches exist as members of predominantly white denominations. African-American churches have served to provide African-American people with leadership positions and opportunities to organize that were denied to them by mainstream American society. Because of this, African-American pastors became the bridge between the African-American and European American communities, a leadership position which enabled them to play a crucial role during the Civil Rights Movement.

Like many Christians, African-American Christians sometimes participate in or attend a Christmas play. &quot;Black Nativity&quot; by Langston Hughes is a re-telling of the classic Nativity story with gospel music. Productions can be found in African-American theaters and churches all over the country.

===Islam===

Generations before the advent of the Atlantic slave trade, Islam was a thriving religion in West Africa due to mix of peaceful, violent and discriminative policies like Jizya introduction via the lucrative Trans-Saharan trade between prominent tribes in the southern Sahara and the Arabs and Berbers in North Africa. In his attesting to this fact the West African scholar Cheikh Anta Diop explained: &quot;The primary reason for the success of Islam in Black Africa ... consequently stems from the fact that it was propagated peacefully at first by solitary Arabo-Berber travelers to certain Black kings and notables, who then spread it about them to those under their jurisdiction.&quot;. Many first-generation slaves were often able to retain their Muslim identity, their descendants were not. Slaves were either forcibly converted to Christianity as was the case in the Catholic lands or were besieged with gross inconveniences to their religious practice such as in the case of the Protestant American mainland.

In the decades after slavery and particularly during the depression era, Islam reemerged in the form of highly visible and sometimes controversial movements in the African-American community. The first of these of note was the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Noble Drew Ali. Ali had a profound influence on Wallace Fard, who later founded the Black nationalist Nation of Islam in 1930. Elijah Muhammad became head of the organization in 1934. Much like Malcolm X, who left the Nation of Islam in 1964, many African-American Muslims now follow traditional Islam.

Many former members of the Nation of Islam converted to Sunni Islam when Warith Deen Mohammed took control of the organization after his father&#x27;s death in 1975 and taught its members the traditional form of Islam based on the Qur&#x27;an. A survey by the Council on American-Islamic Relations shows that 30% of Sunni Mosque attendees are African Americans. In fact, most African-American Muslims are orthodox Muslims, as only 2% are of the Nation of Islam.

===Judaism===
There are 150,000 African Americans in the United States who practice Judaism. Some of these are members of mainstream Jewish groups like the Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox branches of Judaism; others belong to non-mainstream Jewish groups like the Black Hebrew Israelites. The Black Hebrew Israelites are a collection of African-American religious organizations whose practices and beliefs are partially derived from Judaism. Their varied teachings often include the belief that African Americans are descended from the biblical Israelites.

In the last 10 to 15 years, studies have shown that there has been a major increase in the number of African-Americans who identify themselves as being Jewish. Rabbi Capers Funnye, the first cousin of Michelle Obama, says in response to skepticism by some on people being African-American and Jewish at the same time, &quot;I am a Jew, and that breaks through all color and ethnic barriers.&quot;

===Other religions===
Aside from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, there are also African Americans who practice Buddhism and a number of other religions. There is a small but growing number of African Americans who participate in Syncretic Religions, such as Voodoo, Santería, Hoodoo, Ifá and diasporic traditions like the Rastafari movement. Many of them are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean and South America, where these are practiced. Because of religious practices, such as animal sacrifice, which are no longer common among the larger American religions, these groups may be negatively viewed and they are sometimes the victims of harassment. It must be stated, however, that since the Supreme Court judgement that was given to the Lukumi Babaluaye church of Florida in 1993, there has been no major legal challenge to their right to function as they see fit.

=== Spirituality ===
Main Article Used: Hoodoo (spirituality)

Spirituality is an important aspect of African-American culture. Hoodoo is a spiritual practice with multiple aspects which include: tradition, practices, and numerous beliefs. This form of spirituality and practice is derived from Islam and stems from different regions. It was originally created by various aspects of spiritualities and elements of botanicals. The main aspect of the system incorporates beliefs from Islam and Abrahamic religions.

The history of the religions is based upon the Antebellum Era which is also known as the Antebellum South. The practice has roots within the supernatural world. This alteration of the human experience was heavily influenced in order to create change. &quot;Hoodoo was created by African Americans, who were among over 12 million enslaved Africans from various Central and West African List of ethnic groups of Africa.

===Irreligious beliefs===
In a 2008 Pew Forum survey, 12% of African Americans described themselves as being nothing in particular (11%), agnostic (1%), or atheist (&lt;0.5%).

== Life events ==
For most African Americans, the observance of life events follows the pattern of mainstream American culture. While African Americans and whites often lived to themselves for much of American history, both groups generally had the same perspective on American culture. There are some traditions that are unique to African Americans.

Some African Americans have created new rites of passage that are linked to African traditions. Some pre-teen and teenage boys and girls take classes to prepare them for adulthood. These classes tend to focus on spirituality, responsibility, and leadership. Many of these programs are modeled after traditional African ceremonies, with the focus largely on embracing African cultures.

To this day, some African-American couples choose to &quot;jump the broom&quot; as a part of their wedding ceremony. Some sources claim that this practice can be traced back to Ghana. However, other sources argue that the African-American tradition of &quot;jumping the broom&quot; is far more similar to the tradition in England. Although, this tradition largely fell out of favor in the African-American community after the end of slavery, it has experienced a slight resurgence in recent years as some couples seek to reaffirm their African heritage.

Funeral traditions tend to vary based on a number of factors, including religion and location, but there are a number of commonalities. Probably the most important part of death and dying in the African-American culture is the gathering of family and friends. Either in the last days before death or shortly after death, typically any friends and family members that can be reached are notified. This gathering helps to provide spiritual and emotional support, as well as assistance in making decisions and accomplishing everyday tasks.

The spirituality of death is very important in African-American culture. A member of the clergy or members of the religious community, or both, are typically present with the family through the entire process. Death is often viewed as transitory rather than final. Many services are called homegoings or homecomings, instead of funerals, based on the belief that the person is going home to the afterlife; &quot;Returning to God&quot; or the earth. The entire end of life process is generally treated as a celebration of the person&#x27;s life, deeds and accomplishments—the &quot;good things&quot; rather than a mourning of loss. This is most notably demonstrated in the New Orleans jazz funeral tradition where upbeat music, dancing, and food encourage those gathered to be happy and celebrate the homegoing of a beloved friend.

==Cuisine==

In studying of the African-American culture, food cannot be left out as one of the media to understand their traditions, religion, interaction, and social and cultural structures of their community. Observing the ways they prepare their food and eat their food ever since the enslaved era reveals about the nature and identity of African-American culture in the United States. Derek Hicks examines the origins of &quot;gumbo&quot;, which is considered a soul food to many African Americans, in his reference to the intertwinement of food and culture in the African-American community. No written evidence is found historically about the gumbo or its recipes, so through the African-American nature of orally passing their stories and recipes down, gumbo came to represent their truly communal dish. Gumbo is said to be &quot;an invention of enslaved Africans and African Americans&quot; in Louisiana.
The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as yams, peanuts, rice, okra, sorghum, indigo dyes, and cotton, can be traced to African influences. African-American foods reflect creative responses to racial and economic oppression and poverty. Soul food blends African, European, and Native American influences. Dishes like fried chicken, [collard greens], and cornbread are staples that reflect this rich cultural heritage and have become integral components of American cuisine. These culinary practices not only preserve historical recipes but also celebrate the resilience and creativity of the African American community. Under slavery, African Americans were not allowed to eat better cuts of meat, and after emancipation many were often too poor to afford them. During slavery, many African Americans would take these sorts of leftover ingredients from their white owners, often less desirable cuts of meats and vegetables, and prepare them into a dish that has consistency between stew and soup. Through sharing of this food in churches with a gathering of their people, they not only shared the food, but also experience, feelings, attachment, and sense of unity that brings the community together.

Soul food, a hearty cuisine commonly associated with African Americans in the South (but also common to African Americans nationwide), makes creative use of inexpensive products procured through farming and subsistence hunting and fishing. Pig intestines are boiled and sometimes battered and fried to make chitterlings, also known as &quot;chitlins&quot;. Ham hocks and neck bones provide seasoning to soups, beans and boiled greens.

Other common foods, such as fried chicken and fish, macaroni and cheese, cornbread, and hoppin&#x27; john (black-eyed peas and rice) are prepared simply. When the African-American population was considerably more rural than it generally is today, rabbit, opossum, squirrel, and waterfowl were important additions to the diet. Many of these food traditions are especially predominant in many parts of the rural South.

Traditionally prepared soul food is often high in fat, sodium, and starch. Highly suited to the physically demanding lives of laborers, farmhands and rural lifestyles generally, it is now a contributing factor to obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes in a population that has become increasingly more urban and sedentary. As a result, more health-conscious African Americans are using alternative methods of preparation, eschewing trans fats in favor of refined vegetable oils and substituting smoked turkey for fatback and other, cured pork products; limiting the amount of refined sugar in desserts; and emphasizing the consumption of more fruits and vegetables than animal protein. There is some resistance to such changes, however, as they involve deviating from long culinary tradition.
Other soul foods African Americans cook are chicken and waffles and desserts like banana pudding, peach cobbler, red velvet cake and sweet potato pie. Kool-Aid is considered a soul food beverage.

Okra came from Ethiopia and Eritrea. Rice, common to Lowcountry region of South Carolina and Georgia, was imported from the island of Madagascar. Soul food is similar to gypsy cooking in Europe. The roots of soul food are spread up and down the West Coast of Africa, including countries like Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Cameroon, Gabon, Nigeria and Angola, as well as in Western European countries such as Scotland, but the fruits can be found across America.

==Holidays and observances==

As with other American racial and ethnic groups, African Americans observe ethnic holidays alongside traditional American holidays. Holidays observed in African-American culture are not only observed by African Americans but are widely considered American holidays. The birthday of noted American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. has been observed nationally since 1983. It is one of four federal holidays named for an individual.

Black History Month is another example of another African-American observance that has been adopted nationally and its teaching is even required by law in some states. Black History Month is an attempt to focus attention on previously neglected aspects of the American history, chiefly the lives and stories of African Americans. It is observed during the month of February to coincide with the founding of the NAACP and the birthdays of Frederick Douglass, a prominent African-American abolitionist, and Abraham Lincoln, the United States president who signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

On June 7, 1979, President Jimmy Carter decreed that June would be the month of black music. For the past 28 years, presidents have announced to Americans that Black Music Month (also called African-American Music Month) should be recognized as a critical part of American heritage. Black Music Month is highlighted with various events urging citizens to revel in the many forms of music from gospel to hip-hop. African-American musicians, singers, and composers are also highlighted for their contributions to the nation&#x27;s history and culture.

Less-widely observed outside of the African-American community is Emancipation Day popularly known as Juneteenth or Freedom Day, in recognition of the official reading of the Emancipation Proclamation on June 19, 1865, in Texas. Juneteenth is a day when African Americans reflect on their unique history and heritage. It is one of the fastest growing African-American holidays with observances in the United States. Juneteenth was recognized as federal holiday in 2021, and was first observed as such on June 19, 2021.

In addition, other holidays celebrated were African American Day in Louisiana along with African American Emancipation Day across the United States in the 19th century after the abolition of slavery.

Another holiday not widely observed outside of the African-American community is the birthday of Malcolm X. The day is observed on May 19 in American cities with a significant African-American population, including Washington, D.C.

Another noted African-American holiday is Kwanzaa. Like Emancipation Day, it is not widely observed outside of the African-American community, although it is growing in popularity with both African-American and African communities. African-American scholar and activist &quot;Maulana&quot; Ron Karenga invented the festival of Kwanzaa in 1966, as an alternative to the increasing commercialization of Christmas. Derived from the harvest rituals of Africans, Kwanzaa is observed each year from December 26 through January 1. Participants in Kwanzaa celebrations affirm their African heritage and the importance of family and community by drinking from a unity cup; lighting red, black, and green candles; exchanging heritage symbols, such as African art; and recounting the lives of people who struggled for African and African-American freedom.

==Names==

Although many African-American names are common among the larger population of the United States, distinct naming trends have emerged within African-American culture. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture. A dramatic shift in naming traditions began to take shape in the 1960s and 1970s in America. With the rise of the mid-century Civil Rights Movement, there was a dramatic rise in names of various origins. The practice of adopting neo-African or Islamic names gained popularity during that era. Efforts to recover African heritage inspired selection of names with deeper cultural significance. Before this, using African names was uncommon because African Americans were several generations removed from the last ancestor to have an African name, as slaves were often given the names of their enslavers, which were of European origin.

African-American names have origins in many languages including French, Latin, English, Arabic, and African languages. One very notable influence on African-American names is the Muslim religion. Islamic names entered the popular culture with the rise of The Nation of Islam among Black Americans with its focus on civil rights. The popular name &quot;Aisha&quot; has origins in the Qur&#x27;an. Despite the origins of these names in the Muslim religion and the place of the Nation of Islam in the civil rights movement, many Muslim names such as Jamal and Malik entered popular usage among Black Americans simply because they were fashionable, and many Islamic names are now commonly used by African Americans regardless of their religion. Names of African origin began to crop up as well. Names like Ashanti, Tanisha, Aaliyah, Malaika have origins in the continent of Africa.

By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common within the culture to invent new names, although many of the invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as or and suffixes such as and are common, as well as inventive spellings for common names.

Even with the rise of creative names, it is also still common for African Americans to use biblical, historic, or European names.

==Family==
When slavery was practiced in the United States, it was common for families to be separated through sale. Even during slavery, however, many African-American families managed to maintain strong familial bonds. Free African men and women, who managed to buy their own freedom by being hired out, who were emancipated, or who had escaped the slave holder, often worked long and hard to buy the members of their families who remained in bondage and send for them.

Others, separated from blood kin, formed close bonds based on fictive kin; &quot;play&quot; relations, &quot;play&quot; aunts, cousins, and the like. This practice, a holdover from African oral traditions such as &quot;sanankouya&quot;, survived Emancipation, with non-blood family friends commonly accorded the status and titles of blood relations. This broader, more African concept of what constitutes family and community, and the deeply rooted respect for elders that is part of African traditional societies, may be the genesis of the common use of the terms like &quot;cousin&quot; (or &quot;cuz&quot;), &quot;aunt&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot;, &quot;brother&quot;, &quot;sister&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, and &quot;Mama&quot; when addressing other African-American people, some of whom may be complete strangers.

76% of African Americans have said they have spoken with their relatives to learn about their family history.

===African-American family structure===
Immediately after slavery, African-American families struggled to reunite and rebuild what had been taken. As late as 1960, when most African Americans lived under some form of segregation, 78 percent of African-American families were headed by married couples. This number steadily declined during the latter half of the 20th century. For the first time since slavery, a majority of African-American children live in a household with only one parent, typically the mother.

This apparent weakness is balanced by mutual-aid systems established by extended family members to provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as religion and manners to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels in the African-American community, providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community.

African Americans are less likely to own a pet.

Interracial marriages have increased for African Americans since Loving Vs. Virginia.

More than half (51.2%) of African-American children lived with a single parent in 2022, compared with about one in five (21.3%) of white American children.

When African Americans were taken from their homes and forced into slavery, they were separated from mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers and were torn apart from extensive kinship networks.

==Politics and social issues==
Since the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, African Americans are voting and being elected to public office in increasing numbers. the United States had approximately 10,000 African-American elected officials.
African Americans overwhelmingly associate with the Democratic Party. Only 11% of African Americans supported for George W. Bush in the 2004 Presidential Election. In 2016, only 8% of African Americans voted for Republican Donald Trump while 88% of African Americans voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Social issues such as racial profiling, racial disparities in sentencing, higher rates of poverty, lower access to health care and institutional racism in general are important to the African-American community.

African-Americans may express political and social sentiments through hip-hop culture, including graffiti, break-dancing, rapping, and more. This cultural movement makes statements about historical, as well as present-day topics like street culture and incarceration, and oftentimes expresses a call for change. Hip-hop artists play a prominent role in activism and in fighting social injustices, and have a cultural role in defining and reflecting on political and social issues.

Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay-rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands in stark contrast to the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. Some within the African-American community take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton. Sharpton, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.

One of the most well known social and political organizations of Black culture is the Black Panther Party, a now-defunct African-American socialist organization. Black Culture also utilizes cultural slogans for social and political standing such as Say it Loud, I&#x27;m Black and I&#x27;m Proud, Black Card, and even “&quot;It&#x27;s a Black Thing, You Wouldn&#x27;t Understand&quot;”, a popular slogan that was born inside of Black American culture, referring to their culture, not race.

==African-American LGBT culture==
The Black LGBT community refers to the African-American (Black) population who are members of the LGBT community, as a community of marginalized individuals who are further marginalized within their own community. Surveys and research have shown that 80% of African Americans say gays and lesbians endure discrimination compared to the 61% of whites. Black members of the community are not only seen as &quot;other&quot; due to their race, but also due to their sexuality, so they had to combat both racism and homophobia.

Black LGBT first started to be visible during the Harlem Renaissance when a subculture of LGBTQ African-American artists and entertainers emerged. This included people like Alain Locke, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Wallace Thurman, Richard Bruce Nugent, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Moms Mabley, Mabel Hampton, Alberta Hunter, and Gladys Bentley. Places like Savoy Ballroom and the Rockland Palace hosted drag-ball extravaganzas with prizes awarded for the best costumes. Langston Hughes depicted the balls as &quot;spectacles of color&quot;. Historian George Chauncey, author of &quot;Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940&quot;, wrote that during this period &quot;perhaps nowhere were more men willing to venture out in public in drag than in Harlem&quot;.

African-American neighborhoods are types of ethnic enclaves found in many cities in the United States. The formation of African-American neighborhoods is closely linked to the history of segregation in the United States, either through formal laws, or as a product of social norms. Despite this, African-American neighborhoods have played an important role in the development of nearly all aspects of both African-American culture and broader American culture.

===Ghettos===

Due to segregated conditions and widespread poverty, some African-American neighborhoods in the United States have been called &quot;ghettos&quot;. The use of this term is controversial and, depending on the context, potentially offensive. Despite mainstream America&#x27;s use of the term &quot;ghetto&quot; to signify a poor urban area populated by ethnic minorities, those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The African-American ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African Americans, the ghetto was &quot;home&quot;, a place representing authentic &quot;blackness&quot; and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from the rising above the struggle and suffering of being of African descent in America.

Langston Hughes relays in the &quot;Negro Ghetto&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Heart of Harlem&quot; (1945): &quot;The buildings in Harlem are brick and stone/And the streets are long and wide,/But Harlem&#x27;s much more than these alone,/Harlem is what&#x27;s inside.&quot; Playwright August Wilson used the term &quot;ghetto&quot; in &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; (1984) and &quot;Fences&quot; (1987), both of which draw upon the author&#x27;s experience growing up in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, an African-American ghetto.

Although African-American neighborhoods may suffer from civic disinvestment, with lower-quality schools, less-effective policing and fire protection, there are institutions such as churches and museums and political organizations that help to improve the physical and social capital of African-American neighborhoods. In African-American neighborhoods the churches may be important sources of social cohesion. For some African Americans, the kind spirituality learned through these churches works as a protective factor against the corrosive forces of racism. Museums devoted to African-American history are also found in many African-American neighborhoods.

Many African-American neighborhoods are located in inner cities, and these are the mostly residential neighborhoods located closest to the central business district. The built environment is often row houses or brownstones, mixed with older single-family homes that may be converted to multi-family homes. In some areas there are larger apartment buildings. Shotgun houses are an important part of the built environment of some southern African-American neighborhoods. The houses consist of three to five rooms in a row with no hallways. This African-American house design is found in both rural and urban southern areas, mainly in African-American communities and neighborhoods.

==Flag==
The Black American Heritage Flag is an ethnic flag that represents the culture and history of Black American ethnic group. The flag was created in 1967 by Melvin Charles and Gleason T. Jackson. According to the designers, &quot;...the elements of the flag include the color black to represent pride and pigmentation and race; red, to remind us of the rich blood black men have shed for freedom, equality, justice and human dignity throughout the world; and gold, to represent intellect, prosperity, and peace.

==Social networks==
There are African-American social networking websites such as BlackPlanet. Social media is an important political outlet for African Americans. African-American teenagers are the biggest users of Instagram and Snapchat.

==Education==
African Americans have valued education since slavery. African-American communities have worked together to firm and finance public schools. Even when they were barred from accessing education, Black Americans worked together with their supporters to build black colleges for black people. Education for black slaves was heavily prohibited. Enslaved black children and black adults had to take extreme measures to gain literacy, including having to attend underground schools. White Southern slaveholders generally opposed slave literacy in the Southern United States.

Some of the most prominent institutions of Black Culture are the historically Black Colleges and Universities, known as HBCUs. Some of the most renowned of these institutions are Tuskegee University founded by the formerly enslaved Booker T. Washington and Bethune Cookman University founded by Mary McCleod Bethune. There are over 100 HBCUs in the United States of America.

==Literature==

African-American literature emerged in the 18th century, with Phillis Wheatley, an enslaved author, being the first African American to have written published books of poetry. Other prominent authors include W. E. B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Alice Walker.

As African Americans&#x27; place in American society has changed over the centuries, African American literature has evolved. Before the American Civil War, the literature primarily consisted of memoirs by people who had escaped from enslavement the genre of slave narratives included accounts of life in enslavement and the path of justice and redemption to freedom. There was an early distinction between the literature of freed slaves and the literature of free blacks born in the North. Free blacks expressed their oppression in a different narrative form. Free blacks in the North often spoke out against enslavement and racial injustices by using the spiritual narrative. The spiritual addressed many of the same themes of enslaved people narratives but has been largely ignored in current scholarly conversation.

==Folklore==

Historically, African-American folklore revolved around the storytelling and oral history of enslaved African Americans. Prevalent themes in African-American folktales include tricksters, life lessons, the hardships of slavery, and heartwarming tales. African Americans told stories of folk spirits that could outwit their slaveholders and defeat their enemies. These folk stories gave hope to enslaved people that folk spirits would free them from slavery. Folktales have been used to perpetuate negative stereotypes about the African-American community from Minstrel shows to academic journals.
